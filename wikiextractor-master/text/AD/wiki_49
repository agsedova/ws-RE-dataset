This group can be realized as a collection of matrices, linear transformations, or unitary operators on some Hilbert space; it has a variety of representations. This group is significant because special relativity together with quantum mechanics are the two physical theories that are most thoroughly established, and the conjunction of these two theories is the study of the infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group. These have both historical importance in mainstream physics, as well as connections to more speculative present-day theories.\n\nThe full theory of the finite-dimensional representations of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is deduced using the general framework of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. The finite-dimensional representations of the connected component formula_1 of the full Lorentz group are obtained by employing the Lie correspondence and the matrix exponential. The full finite-dimensional representation theory of the universal covering group (and also the spin group, a double cover) formula_2 of formula_1 is obtained, and explicitly given in terms of action on a function space in representations of formula_2 and formula_5. The representatives of time reversal and space inversion are given in space inversion and time reversal, completing the finite-dimensional theory for the full Lorentz group. The general properties of the (\"m\", \"n\") representations are outlined. Action on function spaces is considered, with the action on spherical harmonics and the Riemann P-functions appearing as examples. The infinite-dimensional case of irreducible unitary representations are realized for the formula_2 principal series and the complementary series. Finally, the Plancherel formula for formula_2 is given, and representations of are classified and realized for Lie algebras.\n\nThe development of the representation theory has historically followed the development of the more general theory of representation theory of semisimple groups, largely due to Élie Cartan and Hermann Weyl, but the Lorentz group has also received special attention due to its importance in physics. Notable contributors are physicist E. P. Wigner and mathematician Valentine Bargmann with their Bargmann–Wigner program, one conclusion of which is, roughly, \"a classification of all unitary representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group amounts to a classification of all possible relativistic wave equations\". The classification of the irreducible infinite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group was established by Paul Dirac's doctoral student in theoretical physics, Harish-Chandra, later turned mathematician, in 1947. The corresponding classification for formula_8 was published independently by Bargmann and Israel Gelfand together with Mark Naimark in the same year.\n\nMany of the representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are important in theoretical physics. Representations appear in the description of fields in classical field theory, most importantly the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum field theory and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin. The theory enters into general relativity in the sense that in small enough regions of spacetime, physics is that of special relativity.\n\nThe finite-dimensional irreducible non-unitary representations together with the irreducible infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the \"inhomogeneous\" Lorentz group, the Poincare group, are the representations that have direct physical relevance.\n\nInfinite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group appear by \"restriction\" of the irreducible infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the Poincaré group acting on the Hilbert spaces of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. But these are also of mathematical interest and of \"potential\" direct physical relevance in other roles than that of a mere restriction. There were speculative theories, (tensors and spinors have infinite counterparts in the \"expansors\" of Dirac and the \"expinors\" of Harish-Chandra) consistent with relativity and quantum mechanics, but they have found no proven physical application. Modern speculative theories potentially have similar ingredients per below.\n\nWhile the electromagnetic field together with the gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields \"prior\" to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with it is not a fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.\n\nThe action of the Lorentz group on the space of \"field configurations\" (a field configuration is the spacetime history of a particular solution, e.g. the electromagnetic field in all of space over all time is \"one\" field configuration) resembles the action on the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics, except that the commutator brackets are replaced by field theoretical Poisson brackets.\n\nFor the present purposes the following definition is made: A \"relativistic wave function\" is a set of functions on spacetime which transforms under an arbitrary proper Lorentz transformation as\n\nwhere is an -dimensional matrix representative of belonging to some direct sum of the representations to be introduced below.\n\nThe most useful relativistic quantum mechanics \"one-particle\" theories (there are no fully consistent such theories) are the Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation in their original setting. They are relativistically invariant and their solutions transform under the Lorentz group as Lorentz scalars () and bispinors respectively (). The electromagnetic field is a relativistic wave function according to this definition, transforming under .\n\nThe infinite-dimensional representations may be used in the analysis of scattering.\n\nIn quantum field theory, the demand for relativistic invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant. This has the implication that there is one or more infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group acting on Fock space. One way to guarantee the existence of such representations is the existence of a Lagrangian description (with modest requirements imposed, see the reference) of the system using the canonical formalism, from which a realization of the generators of the Lorentz group may be deduced.\n\nThe transformations of field operators illustrate the complementary role played by the finite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group and the infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the Poincare group, witnessing the deep unity between mathematics and physics. For illustration, consider the definition an -component field operator: A relativistic field operator is a set of operator valued functions on spacetime which transforms under proper Poincaré transformations according to\n\nHere is the unitary operator representing on the Hilbert space on which is defined and is an -dimensional representation of the Lorentz group. The transformation rule is the second Wightman axiom of quantum field theory.\n\nBy considerations of differential constraints that the field operator must be subjected to in order to describe a single particle with definite mass and spin (or helicity), it is deduced that\n\nwhere are interpreted as creation and annihilation operators respectively. The creation operator transforms according to\n\nand similarly for the annihilation operator. The point to be made is that the field operator transforms according to a finite-dimensional non-unitary representation of the Lorentz group, while the creation operator transforms under the infinite-dimensional unitary representation of the Poincare group characterized by the mass and spin of the particle. The connection between the two are the \"wave functions\", also called \"coefficient functions\"\n\nthat carry \"both\" the indices operated on by Lorentz transformations and the indices operated on by Poincaré transformations. This may be called the Lorentz–Poincaré connection. To exhibit the connection, subject both sides of equation to a Lorentz transformation resulting in for e.g. ,\n\nwhere is the non-unitary Lorentz group representative of and is a unitary representative of the so-called \"Wigner rotation\" associated to and that derives from the representation of the Poincaré group, and is the spin of the particle.\n\nAll of the above formulas, including the definition of the field operator in terms of creation and annihilation operators, as well as the differential equations satisfied by the field operator for a particle with specified mass, spin and the representation under which it is supposed to transform, and also that of the wave function, can be derived from group theoretical considerations alone once the frameworks of quantum mechanics and special relativity is given.\n\nIn theories in which spacetime can have more than dimensions, the generalized Lorentz groups of the appropriate dimension take the place of .\n\nThe requirement of Lorentz invariance takes on perhaps its most dramatic effect in string theory. \"Classical\" relativistic strings can be handled in the Lagrangian framework by using the Nambu–Goto action. This results in a relativistically invariant theory in any spacetime dimension. But as it turns out, the theory of open and closed bosonic strings (the simplest string theory) is impossible to quantize in such a way that the Lorentz group is represented on the space of states (a Hilbert space) unless the dimension of spacetime is 26. The corresponding result for superstring theory is again deduced demanding Lorentz invariance, but now with supersymmetry. In these theories the Poincaré algebra is replaced by a supersymmetry algebra which is a -graded Lie algebra extending the Poincaré algebra. The structure of such an algebra is to a large degree fixed by the demands of Lorentz invariance. In particular, the fermionic operators (grade ) belong to a or representation space of the (ordinary) Lorentz Lie algebra. The only possible dimension of spacetime in such theories is 10.\n\nRepresentation theory of groups in general, and Lie groups in particular, is a very rich subject. The Lorentz group has some properties that makes it \"agreeable\" and others that make it \"not very agreeable\" within the context of representation theory; the group is simple and thus semisimple, but is not connected, and none of its components are simply connected. Furthermore, the Lorentz group is not compact.\n\nFor finite-dimensional representations, the presence of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group can be dealt with the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the \"complete reducibility property\". But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to be dealt with separately.\n\nThe development of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of the subject in general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873. By 1888 the classification of simple Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing. In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations of simple Lie algebras, the path that will be followed here, was completed by Élie Cartan. Richard Brauer was 1935–38 largely responsible for the development of the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras. The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Harish-Chandra and physicists Eugene Wigner and Valentine Bargmann made substantial contributions both to general representation theory and in particular to the Lorentz group. Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit everything together in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.\n\nAccording to the strategy, the irreducible complex linear representations of the complexification, formula_14 of the Lie algebra formula_15 of the Lorentz group are to be found. A convenient basis for formula_15 is given by the three generators of rotations and the three generators of boosts. They are explicitly given in conventions and Lie algebra bases.\n\nThe Lie algebra is complexified, and the basis is changed to the components of its two ideals\n\nThe components of and separately satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra formula_18 and, moreover, they commute with each other,\n\nwhere are indices which each take values , and is the three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol. Let formula_20 and formula_21 denote the complex linear span of and respectively.\n\nOne has the isomorphisms\n\nwhere formula_22 is the complexification of formula_23\n\nThe utility of these isomorphisms comes from the fact that all irreducible representations of formula_18, and hence (see strategy) all irreducible complex linear representations of formula_25 are known. According to the final conclusion in strategy, the irreducible complex linear representation of formula_22 is isomorphic to one of the highest weight representations. These are explicitly given in complex linear representations of formula_27\n\nThe Lie algebra formula_28 is the Lie algebra of formula_29 It contains the compact subgroup with Lie algebra formula_30 The latter is a compact real form of formula_31 Thus from the first statement of the unitarian trick, representations of are in one-to-one correspondence with holomorphic representations of formula_29\n\nBy compactness, Peter–Weyl theorem applies to , and hence orthonormality of irreducible characters may be appealed to. The irreducible unitary representations of are precisely the tensor products of irreducible unitary representations of .\n\nBy appeal to simple connectedness, the second statement of the unitarian trick is applied. The objects in the following list are in one-to-one correspondence:\n\nTensor products of representations appear at the Lie algebra level as either of\n\nwhere is the identity operator. Here, the latter interpretation, which follows from , is intended. The highest weight representations of formula_22 are indexed by for . (The highest weights are actually , but the notation here is adapted to that of formula_37) The tensor products of two such complex linear factors then form the irreducible complex linear representations of formula_31\n\nFinally, the formula_39-linear representations of the real forms of the far left, formula_15, and the far right, formula_25 in are obtained from the formula_42-linear representations of formula_28 characterized in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe complex linear representations of the complexification of formula_44 obtained via isomorphisms in , stand in one-to-one correspondence with the real linear representations of formula_27 The set of all \"real linear\" irreducible representations of formula_22 are thus indexed by a pair . The complex linear ones, corresponding precisely to the complexification of the real linear formula_18 representations, are of the form , while the conjugate linear ones are the . All others are real linear only. The linearity properties follow from the canonical injection, the far right in , of formula_22 into its complexification. Representations on the form or are given by \"real\" matrices (the latter are not irreducible). Explicitly, the real linear -representations of formula_22 are\n\nwhere formula_51 are the complex linear irreducible representations of formula_22 and formula_53 their complex conjugate representations. (The labeling is usually in the mathematics literature , but half-integers are chosen here to conform with the labeling for the formula_54 Lie algebra.) Here the tensor product is interpreted in the former sense of . These representations are concretely realized below.\n\nVia the displayed isomorphisms in and knowledge of the complex linear irreducible representations of formula_28 upon solving for and , all irreducible representations of formula_56 and, by restriction, those of formula_15 are obtained. The representations of formula_15 obtained this way are real linear (and not complex or conjugate linear) because the algebra is not closed upon conjugation, but they are still irreducible. Since formula_15 is semisimple, all its representations can be built up as direct sums of the irreducible ones.\n\nThus the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz algebra are classified by an ordered pair of half-integers and , conventionally written as one of\n\nwhere is a finite-dimensional vector space. These are, up to a similarity transformation, uniquely given by\n\nwhere is the -dimensional unit matrix and\n\nare the -dimensional irreducible representations of formula_62 also termed spin matrices or \"angular momentum matrices\". These are explicitly given as\n\nwhere denotes the Kronecker delta. In components, with , , the representations are given by\n\n\nSince for any irreducible representation for which it is essential to operate over the field of complex numbers, the direct sum of representations and have particular relevance to physics, since it permits to use linear operators over real numbers.\n\n\nThe approach in this section is based on theorems that, in turn, are based on the fundamental Lie correspondence. The Lie correspondence is in essence a dictionary between connected Lie groups and Lie algebras. The link between them is the exponential mapping from the Lie algebra to the Lie group, denoted formula_65 The general theory is summarized in technical introduction to finite-dimensional representation theory.\n\nIf formula_66 for some vector space is a representation, a representation of the connected component of is defined by\n\nThis definition applies whether the resulting representation is projective or not.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, it is important whether the first formula in can be used for all elements of the \"group\". It holds for all formula_67, however, in the general case, e.g. for formula_2, not all are in the image of .\n\nBut formula_69 \"is\" surjective. One way to show this is to make use of the isomorphism formula_70 the latter being the Möbius group. It is a quotient of formula_71 (see the linked article). The quotient map is denoted with formula_72 The map formula_73 is onto. Apply with being the differential of at the identity. Then\n\nSince the left hand side is surjective (both and are), the right hand side is surjective and hence formula_75 is surjective. Finally, recycle the argument once more, but now with the known isomorphism between and formula_76 to find that is onto for the connected component of the Lorentz group.\n\nThe Lorentz group is \"doubly connected\", i. e. is a group with two equivalence classes of loops as its elements.\n\nTo exhibit the fundamental group of , the topology of its covering group formula_2 is considered. By the polar decomposition theorem, any matrix formula_78 may be \"uniquely\" expressed as\n\nwhere is unitary with determinant one, hence in , and is Hermitian with trace zero. The trace and determinant conditions imply:\n\nThe manifestly continuous one-to-one map is a homeomorphism with continuous inverse given by (the locus of is identified with formula_81)\n\nexplicitly exhibiting that formula_2 is simply connected. But formula_84 where formula_85 is the center of formula_2. Identifying and amounts to identifying with , which in turn amounts to identifying antipodal points on formula_87 Thus topologically,\n\nwhere last factor is not simply connected: Geometrically, it is seen (for visualization purposes, formula_89 may be replaced by formula_90) that a path from to in formula_91 \"is\" a loop in formula_92 since and are antipodal points, and that it is not contractible to a point. But a path from to , thence to again, a loop in formula_89 and a \"double loop\" (considering , where formula_94 is the covering map) in formula_92 that \"is\" contractible to a point (continuously move away from \"upstairs\" in formula_89 and shrink the path there to the point ). Thus is a group with two equivalence classes of loops as its elements, or put more simply, is \"doubly connected\".\nSince has two elements, some representations of the Lie algebra will yield projective representations. Once it is known whether a representation is projective, formula applies to all group elements and all representations, including the projective ones — with the understanding that the representative of a group element will depend on which element in the Lie algebra (the in ) is used to represent the group element in the standard representation.\n\nFor the Lorentz group, the -representation is projective when is a half-integer. See the section spinors.\n\nFor a projective representation of , it holds that\n\nsince any loop in traversed twice, due to the double connectedness, is contractible to a point, so that its homotopy class is that of a constant map. It follows that is a double-valued function. It is not possible to consistently chose a sign to obtain a continuous representation of all of , but this is possible \"locally\" around any point.\n\nConsider formula_5 as a \"real\" Lie algebra with basis\n\nwhere the sigmas are the Pauli matrices. From the relations\n\nis obtained\n\nwhich are exactly on the form of the -dimensional version of the commutation relations for formula_15 (see conventions and Lie algebra bases below). Thus, the map , , extended by linearity is an isomorphism. Since formula_2 is simply connected, it is the universal covering group of .\n\nLet be a path from to , denote its homotopy class by and let be the set of all such homotopy classes. Define the set\n\nand endow it with the multiplication operation\n\nwhere formula_101 is the path multiplication of formula_102 and formula_103:\n\nWith this multiplication, becomes a group isomorphic to formula_105 the universal covering group of . Since each has two elements, by the above construction, there is a 2:1 covering map . According to covering group theory, the Lie algebras formula_106 and formula_107 of are all isomorphic. The covering map is simply given by .\n\nFor an algebraic view of the universal covering group, let formula_2 act on the set of all Hermitian matrices formula_109 by the operation\nThe action on formula_109 is linear. An element of formula_109 may be written in the form\n\nThe map is a group homomorphism into formula_112 Thus formula_113 is a 4-dimensional representation of formula_2. Its kernel must in particular take the identity matrix to itself, and therefore . Thus for in the kernel so, by Schur's lemma, is a multiple of the identity, which must be since . The space formula_109 is mapped to Minkowski space , via\n\nThe action of on formula_109 preserves determinants. The induced representation of formula_2 on formula_118 via the above isomorphism, given by\n\npreserves the Lorentz inner product since\n\nThis means that belongs to the full Lorentz group . By the main theorem of connectedness, since formula_2 is connected, its image under in is connected, and hence is contained in .\n\nIt can be shown that the Lie map of formula_121 is a Lie algebra isomorphism: formula_122 The map is also onto.\n\nThus formula_2, since it is simply connected, is the universal covering group of , isomorphic to the group of above.\nThe exponential mapping formula_124 is not onto. The matrix\n\nis in formula_105 but there is no formula_126 such that .\nIn general, if is an element of a connected Lie group with Lie algebra formula_127 then, by ,\n\nThe matrix can be written\nThe complex linear representations of formula_5 and formula_2 are more straightforward to obtain than the formula_130 representations. They can be (and usually are) written down from scratch. The holomorphic group representations (meaning the corresponding Lie algebra representation is complex linear) are related to the complex linear Lie algebra representations by exponentiation. The real linear representations of formula_5 are exactly the -representations. They can be exponentiated too. The -representations are complex linear and are (isomorphic to) the highest weight-representations. These are usually indexed with only one integer (but half-integers are used here).\n\nThe mathematics convention is used in this section for convenience. Lie algebra elements differ by a factor of and there is no factor of in the exponential mapping compared to the physics convention used elsewhere. Let the basis of formula_5 be\n\nThis choice of basis, and the notation, is standard in the mathematical literature.\n\nThe irreducible holomorphic -dimensional representations formula_133 can be realized on the space of homogeneous polynomial of degree in 2 variables formula_134 the elements of which are\n\nThe action of formula_2 is given by\n\nThe associated formula_5-action is, using and the definition above, for the basis elements of formula_138\n\nWith a choice of basis for formula_139, these representations become matrix Lie algebras.\n\nThe -representations are realized on a space of polynomials formula_140 in formula_141 homogeneous of degree in formula_142 and homogeneous of degree in formula_143 The representations are given by\n\nBy employing again it is found that\n\nIn particular for the basis elements,\n\n\\phi_{\\mu,\\nu}(X) &= -z_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_1} - \\overline{z_2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\overline{z_1}} \\\\\n\nThe representations, defined above via (as restrictions to the real form formula_144) of tensor products of irreducible complex linear representations and of formula_138 are irreducible, and they are the only irreducible representations.\n\nThe representations are -dimensional. This follows easiest from counting the dimensions in any concrete realization, such as the one given in representations of formula_2 and formula_22. For a Lie general algebra formula_107 the Weyl dimension formula,\n\napplies, where is the set of positive roots, is the highest weight, and is half the sum of the positive roots. The inner product formula_150 is that of the Lie algebra formula_127 invariant under the action of the Weyl group on formula_152 the Cartan subalgebra. The roots (really elements of formula_153 are via this inner product identified with elements of formula_154 For formula_138 the formula reduces to , \"where the present notation must be taken into account\". The highest weight is . By taking tensor products, the result follows.\n\nIf a representation of a Lie group is not faithful, then is a nontrivial normal subgroup. There are three relevant cases.\nIn the case of , the first case is excluded since is semi-simple. The second case (and the first case) is excluded because is simple. For the third case, is isomorphic to the quotient formula_156 But formula_85 is the center of formula_158 It follows that the center of is trivial, and this excludes the third case. The conclusion is that every representation and every projective representation for finite-dimensional vector spaces are faithful.\n\nBy using the fundamental Lie correspondence, the statements and the reasoning above translate directly to Lie algebras with (abelian) nontrivial non-discrete normal subgroups replaced by (one-dimensional) nontrivial ideals in the Lie algebra, and the center of replaced by the center of formula_159The center of any semisimple Lie algebra is trivial and formula_15 is semi-simple and simple, and hence has no non-trivial ideals.\n\nA related fact is that if the corresponding representation of formula_2 is faithful, then the representation is projective. Conversely, if the representation is non-projective, then the corresponding formula_2 representation is not faithful, but is .\n\nThe Lie algebra representation is not Hermitian. Accordingly, the corresponding (projective) representation of the group is never unitary. This is due to the non-compactness of the Lorentz group. In fact, a connected simple non-compact Lie group cannot have \"any\" nontrivial unitary finite-dimensional representations. There is a topological proof of this. Let , where is finite-dimensional, be a continuous unitary representation of the non-compact connected simple Lie group . Then where is the compact subgroup of consisting of unitary transformations of . The kernel of is a normal subgroup of . Since is simple, is either all of , in which case is trivial, or is trivial, in which case is faithful. In the latter case is a diffeomorphism onto its image, and is a Lie group. This would mean that is an embedded non-compact Lie subgroup of the compact group . This is impossible with the subspace topology on since all \"embedded\" Lie subgroups of a Lie group are closed If were closed, it would be compact, and then would be compact, contrary to assumption.\n\nIn the case of the Lorentz group, this can also be seen directly from the definitions. The representations of and used in the construction are Hermitian. This means that is Hermitian, but is anti-Hermitian. The non-unitarity is not a problem in quantum field theory, since the objects of concern are not required to have a Lorentz-invariant positive definite norm.\n\nThe representation is, however, unitary when restricted to the rotation subgroup , but these representations are not irreducible as representations of SO(3). A Clebsch–Gordan decomposition can be applied showing that an representation have -invariant subspaces of highest weight (spin) , where each possible highest weight (spin) occurs exactly once. A weight subspace of highest weight (spin) is -dimensional. So for example, the (, ) representation has spin 1 and spin 0 subspaces of dimension 3 and 1 respectively.\n\nSince the angular momentum operator is given by , the highest spin in quantum mechanics of the rotation sub-representation will be and the \"usual\" rules of addition of angular momenta and the formalism of 3-j symbols, 6-j symbols, etc. applies.\n\nIt is the -invariant subspaces of the irreducible representations that determine whether a representation has spin. From the above paragraph, it is seen that the representation has spin if is half-integral. The simplest are and , the Weyl-spinors of dimension . Then, for example, and are a spin representations of dimensions and respectively. According to the above paragraph, there are subspaces with spin both and in the last two cases, so these representations cannot likely represent a \"single\" physical particle which must be well-behaved under . It cannot be ruled out in general, however, that representations with multiple subrepresentations with different spin can represent physical particles with well-defined spin. It may be that there is a suitable relativistic wave equation that projects out \"unphysical components\", leaving only a single spin.\n\nConstruction of pure spin representations for any (under ) from the irreducible representations involves taking tensor products of the Dirac-representation with a non-spin representation, extraction of a suitable subspace, and finally imposing differential constraints.\n\nThe following theorems are applied to examine whether the dual representation of an irreducible representation is isomorphic to the original representation:\nHere, the elements of the Weyl group are considered as orthogonal transformations, acting by matrix multiplication, on the real vector space of roots. If is an element of the Weyl group of a semisimple Lie algebra, then . In the case of formula_138 the Weyl group is . It follows that each is isomorphic to its dual formula_166 The root system of formula_167 is shown in the figure to the right. The Weyl group is generated by formula_168 where formula_169 is reflection in the plane orthogonal to as ranges over all roots. Inspection shows that so . Using the fact that if are Lie algebra representations and , then , the conclusion for is\n\nIf is a representation of a Lie algebra, then formula_171 is a representation, where the bar denotes entry-wise complex conjugation in the representative matrices. This follows from that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication. In general, every irreducible representation of formula_172 can be written uniquely as , where\n\nwith formula_174 holomorphic (complex linear) and formula_175 anti-holomorphic (conjugate linear). For formula_138 since formula_177 is holomorphic, formula_178 is anti-holomorphic. Direct examination of the explicit expressions for formula_179 and formula_180 in equation below shows that they are holomorphic and anti-holomorphic respectively. Closer examination of the expression also allows for identification of formula_174 and formula_175 for formula_183 as\n\nUsing the above identities (interpreted as pointwise addition of functions), for yields\n\nwhere the statement for the group representations follow from = . It follows that the irreducible representations have real matrix representatives if and only if . Reducible representations on the form have real matrices too.\n\nIn general representation theory, if is a representation of a Lie algebra formula_127 then there is an associated representation of formula_127 on , also denoted , given by\n\nLikewise, a representation of a group yields a representation on of , still denoted , given by\n\nIf and are the standard representations on formula_188 and if the action is restricted to formula_189 then the two above representations are the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra and the adjoint representation of the group respectively. The corresponding representations (some formula_190 or formula_191) always exist for any matrix Lie group, and are paramount for investigation of the representation theory in general, and for any given Lie group in particular.\n\nApplying this to the Lorentz group, if is a projective representation, then direct calculation using shows that the induced representation on is a proper representation, i.e. a representation without phase factors.\n\nIn quantum mechanics this means that if or is a representation acting on some Hilbert space , then the corresponding induced representation acts on the set of linear operators on . As an example, the induced representation of the projective spin representation on is the non-projective 4-vector (, ) representation.\n\nFor simplicity, consider only the \"discrete part\" of , that is, given a basis for , the set of constant matrices of various dimension, including possibly infinite dimensions. The induced 4-vector representation of above on this simplified has an invariant 4-dimensional subspace that is spanned by the four gamma matrices. (The metric convention is different in the linked article.) In a corresponding way, the complete Clifford algebra of spacetime, formula_192 whose complexification is formula_193 generated by the gamma matrices decomposes as a direct sum of representation spaces of a scalar irreducible representation (irrep), the , a pseudoscalar irrep, also the , but with parity inversion eigenvalue , see the next section below, the already mentioned vector irrep, , a pseudovector irrep, with parity inversion eigenvalue +1 (not −1), and a tensor irrep, . The dimensions add up to . In other words,\n\nwhere, as is customary, a representation is confused with its representation space.\n\nThe six-dimensional representation space of the tensor -representation inside formula_194 has two roles. The\n\nwhere formula_195 are the gamma matrices, the sigmas, only of which are non-zero due to antisymmetry of the bracket, span the tensor representation space. Moreover, they have the commutation relations of the Lorentz Lie algebra,\n\nand hence constitute a representation (in addition to spanning a representation space) sitting inside formula_192 the spin representation. For details, see bispinor and Dirac algebra.\n\nThe conclusion is that every element of the complexified formula_194 in (i.e. every complex matrix) has well defined Lorentz transformation properties. In addition, it has a spin-representation of the Lorentz Lie algebra, which upon exponentiation becomes a spin representation of the group, acting on formula_198 making it a space of bispinors.\n\nThere is a multitude of other representations that can be deduced from the irreducible ones, such as those obtained by taking direct sums, tensor products, and quotients of the irreducible representations. Other methods of obtaining representations include the restriction of a representation of a larger group containing the Lorentz group, e.g. formula_199 and the Poincaré group. These representations are in general not irreducible.\n\nThe Lorentz group and its Lie algebra have the \"complete reducibility property\". This means that every representation reduces to a direct sum of irreducible representations. The reducible representations will therefore not be discussed.\n\nThe (possibly projective) representation is irreducible as a representation , the identity component of the Lorentz group, in physics terminology the proper orthochronous Lorentz group. If it can be extended to a representation of all of , the full Lorentz group, including space parity inversion and time reversal. The representations can be extended likewise.\n\nFor space parity inversion, the adjoint action of on formula_15 is considered, where is the standard representative of space parity inversion, , given by\n\nIt is these properties of and under that motivate the terms \"vector\" for and pseudovector or \"axial vector\" for . In a similar way, if is any representation of formula_15 and is its associated group representation, then acts on the representation of by the adjoint action, for formula_202 . If is to be included in , then consistency with requires that\n\nholds, where and are defined as in the first section. This can hold only if and have the same dimensions, i.e. only if . When then can be extended to an irreducible representation of , the orthochronous Lorentz group. The parity reversal representative does not come automatically with the general construction of the representations. It must be specified separately. The matrix (or a multiple of modulus −1 times it) may be used in the representation.\n\nIf parity is included with a minus sign (the matrix ) in the representation, it is called a pseudoscalar representation.\n\nTime reversal , acts similarly on formula_15 by\n\nBy explicitly including a representative for , as well as one for , a representation of the full Lorentz group is obtained. A subtle problem appears however in application to physics, in particular quantum mechanics. When considering the full Poincaré group, four more generators, the , in addition to the and generate the group. These are interpreted as generators of translations. The time-component is the Hamiltonian . The operator satisfies the relation\n\nin analogy to the relations above with formula_15 replaced by the full Poincaré algebra. By just cancelling the 's, the result would imply that for every state with positive energy in a Hilbert space of quantum states with time-reversal invariance, there would be a state with negative energy . Such states do not exist. The operator is therefore chosen antilinear and antiunitary, so that it anticommutes with , resulting in , and its action on Hilbert space likewise becomes antilinear and antiunitary. It may be expressed as the composition of complex conjugation with multiplication by a unitary matrix. This is mathematically sound, see Wigner's theorem, but with very strict requirements on terminology, is not a \"representation\".\n\nWhen constructing theories such as QED which is invariant under space parity and time reversal, Dirac spinors may be used, while theories that do not, such as the electroweak force, must be formulated in terms of Weyl spinors. The Dirac representation, , is usually taken to include both space parity and time inversions. Without space parity inversion, it is not an irreducible representation.\n\nThe third discrete symmetry entering in the CPT theorem along with and , charge conjugation symmetry , has nothing directly to do with Lorentz invariance.\n\nIf is a vector space of functions of a finite number of variables , then the action on a scalar function formula_205 given by\n\nproduces another function . Here is an -dimensional representation, and is a possibly infinite-dimensional representation. A special case of this construction is when is a space of functions defined on the a linear group itself, viewed as a -dimensional manifold embedded in formula_206 (with the dimension of the matrices). This is the setting in which the Peter–Weyl theorem and the Borel–Weil theorem are formulated. The former demonstrates the existence of a Fourier decomposition of functions on a compact group into characters of finite-dimensional representations. The latter theorem, providing more explicit representations, makes use of the unitarian trick to yield representations of complex non-compact groups, e.g. formula_158\n\nThe following exemplifies action of the Lorentz group and the rotation subgroup on some function spaces.\n\nThe subgroup of three-dimensional Euclidean rotations has an infinite-dimensional representation on the Hilbert space\n\nwhere formula_209 are the spherical harmonics. An arbitrary square integrable function one the unit sphere can be expressed as\n\nwhere the are generalized Fourier coefficients.\n\nThe Lorentz group action restricts to that of and is expressed as\n\nwhere the are obtained from the representatives of odd dimension of the generators of rotation.\n\nThe identity component of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to the Möbius group . This group can be thought of as conformal mappings of either the complex plane or, via stereographic projection, the Riemann sphere. In this way, the Lorentz group itself can be thought of as acting conformally on the complex plane or on the Riemann sphere.\n\nIn the plane, a Möbius transformation characterized by the complex numbers acts on the plane according to\n\nand can be represented by complex matrices\n\nsince multiplication by a nonzero complex scalar does not change . These are elements of formula_2 and are unique up to a sign (since give the same ), hence formula_211\n\nThe Riemann P-functions, solutions of Riemann's differential equation, are an example of a set of functions that transform among themselves under the action of the Lorentz group. The Riemann P-functions are expressed as\n\nwhere the are complex constants. The P-function on the right hand side can be expressed using standard hypergeometric functions. The connection is\n\nThe set of constants in the upper row on the left hand side are the regular singular points of the Gauss' hypergeometric equation. Its \"exponents\", i. e. solutions of the indicial equation, for expansion around the singular point are and ,corresponding to the two linearly independent solutions, and for expansion around the singular point they are and . Similarly, the exponents for are and for the two solutions.\n\nOne has thus\n\nwhere the condition (sometimes called Riemann's identity)\n\non the exponents of the solutions of Riemann's differential equation has been used to define .\n\nThe first set of constants on the left hand side in , denotes the regular singular points of Riemann's differential equation. The second set, , are the corresponding exponents at for one of the two linearly independent solutions, and, accordingly, are exponents at for the second solution.\n\nDefine an action of the Lorentz group on the set of all Riemann P-functions by first setting\n\nwhere are the entries in\n\nfor a Lorentz transformation.\n\nDefine\n\nwhere is a Riemann P-function. The resulting function is again a Riemann P-function. The effect of the Möbius transformation of the argument is that of shifting the poles to new locations, hence changing the critical points, but there is no change in the exponents of the differential equation the new function satisfies. The new function is expressed as\n\nwhere\n\nThe Lorentz group and its double cover formula_2 also have infinite dimensional unitary representations, studied independently by , and at the instigation of Paul Dirac. This trail of development begun with where he devised matrices and necessary for description of higher spin (compare Dirac matrices), elaborated upon by , see also , and proposed precursors of the Bargmann-Wigner equations. In he proposed a concrete infinite-dimensional representation space whose elements were called expansors as a generalization of tensors. These ideas were incorporated by Harish–Chandra and expanded with expinors as an infinite-dimensional generalization of spinors in his 1947 paper.\n\nThe Plancherel formula for these groups was first obtained by Gelfand and Naimark through involved calculations. The treatment was subsequently considerably simplified by and , based on an analogue for formula_2 of the integration formula of Hermann Weyl for compact Lie groups. Elementary accounts of this approach can be found in and .\n\nThe theory of spherical functions for the Lorentz group, required for harmonic analysis on the hyperboloid model of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space sitting in Minkowski space is considerably easier than the general theory. It only involves representations from the spherical principal series and can be treated directly, because in radial coordinates the Laplacian on the hyperboloid is equivalent to the Laplacian on formula_215 This theory is discussed in , , and the posthumous text of .\n\nThe principal series, or unitary principal series, are the unitary representations induced from the one-dimensional representations of the lower triangular subgroup  of formula_216 Since the one-dimensional representations of correspond to the representations of the diagonal matrices, with non-zero complex entries and , they thus have the form\n\nfor an integer, real and with . The representations are irreducible; the only repetitions, i.e. isomorphisms of representations, occur when is replaced by . By definition the representations are realized on sections of line bundles on formula_218 which is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere. When , these representations constitute the so-called spherical principal series.\n\nThe restriction of a principal series to the maximal compact subgroup of  can also be realized as an induced representation of  using the identification , where is the maximal torus in  consisting of diagonal matrices with . It is the representation induced from the 1-dimensional representation , and is independent of . By Frobenius reciprocity, on  they decompose as a direct sum of the irreducible representations of  with dimensions with a non-negative integer.\n\nUsing the identification between the Riemann sphere minus a point and formula_219 the principal series can be defined directly on formula_220 by the formula\n\nIrreducibility can be checked in a variety of ways:\n\n\n\nThe for , the complementary series is defined on formula_220 for the inner product\n\nwith the action given by\n\nThe representations in the complementary series are irreducible and pairwise non-isomorphic. As a representation of , each is isomorphic to the Hilbert space direct sum of all the odd dimensional irreducible representations of . Irreducibility can be proved by analyzing the action of formula_107 on the algebraic sum of these subspaces or directly without using the Lie algebra.\n\nThe only irreducible unitary representations of formula_2 are the principal series, the complementary series and the trivial representation.\nSince acts as on the principal series and trivially on the remainder, these will give all the irreducible unitary representations of the Lorentz group, provided is taken to be even.\n\nTo decompose the left regular representation of  on formula_230 only the principal series are required. This immediately yields the decomposition on the subrepresentations formula_231 the left regular representation of the Lorentz group, and formula_232 the regular representation on 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. (The former only involves principal series representations with \"k\" even and the latter only those with .)\n\nThe left and right regular representation and are defined on formula_230 by\n\nNow if is an element of , the operator formula_235 defined by\n\nis Hilbert–Schmidt. Define a Hilbert space  by\n\nwhere\n\nand formula_239 denotes the Hilbert space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators on formula_240 Then the map  defined on by\n\nextends to a unitary of formula_230 onto .\n\nThe map  satisfies the intertwining property\n\nIf are in then by unitarity\n\nThus if formula_245 denotes the convolution of formula_246 and formula_247 and formula_248 then\n\nThe last two displayed formulas are usually referred to as the Plancherel formula and the Fourier inversion formula respectively.\n\nThe Plancherel formula extends to all formula_250 By a theorem of Jacques Dixmier and Paul Malliavin, every smooth compactly supported function on formula_251 is a finite sum of convolutions of similar functions, the inversion formula holds for such . It can be extended to much wider classes of functions satisfying mild differentiability conditions.\n\nThe strategy followed in the classification of the irreducible infinite-dimensional representations is, in analogy to the finite-dimensional case, to \"assume\" they exist, and to investigate their properties. Thus first assume that an irreducible strongly continuous infinite-dimensional representation on a Hilbert space of is at hand. Since is a subgroup, is a representation of it as well. Each irreducible subrepresentation of is finite-dimensional, and the representation is reducible into a direct sum of irreducible finite-dimensional unitary representations of if is unitary.\n\nThe steps are the following:\n\nOne suitable choice of basis and labeling is given by\n\nIf this were a \"finite-dimensional\" representation, then would correspond the lowest occurring eigenvalue of in the representation, equal to , and would correspond to the highest occurring eigenvalue, equal to . In the infinite-dimensional case, retains this meaning, but does not. For simplicity, it is assumed that a given occurs at most once in a given representation (this is the case for finite-dimensional representations), and it can be shown that the assumption is possible to avoid (with a slightly more complicated calculation) with the same results.\n\nThe next step is to compute the matrix elements of the operators and forming the basis of the Lie algebra of formula_37 The matrix elements of formula_254 and formula_255 (the \"complexified\" Lie algebra is understood) are known from the representation theory of the rotation group, and are given by\n\nwhere the labels and have been dropped since they are the same for all basis vectors in the representation.\n\nDue to the commutation relations\n\nthe triple is a vector operator and the Wigner–Eckart theorem applies for computation of matrix elements between the states represented by the chosen basis. The matrix elements of\n\nwhere the superscript signifies that the defined quantities are the components of a spherical tensor operator of rank (which explains the factor as well) and the subscripts are referred to as in formulas below, are given by\n\nHere the first factors on the right hand sides are Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for coupling with to get . The second factors are the \"reduced matrix elements\". They do not depend on or , but depend on and, of course, . For a complete list of non-vanishing equations, see .\n\nThe next step is to demand that the Lie algebra relations hold, i.e. that\n\nThis results in a set of equations for which the solutions are\n\nwhere\n\nThe imposition of the requirement of unitarity of the corresponding representation of the \"group\" restricts the possible values for the arbitrary complex numbers and . Unitarity of the group representation translates to the requirement of the Lie algebra representatives being Hermitian, meaning\n\nThis translates to\n\nleading to\n\nwhere is the angle of on polar form. For follows formula_266 and formula_267 is chosen by convention. There are two possible cases:\n\n\n\nThis shows that the representations of above are \"all\" infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representations.\n\nThe metric of choice is given by , and the physics convention for Lie algebras and the exponential mapping is used. These choices are arbitrary, but once they are made, fixed. One possible choice of basis for the Lie algebra is, in the 4-vector representation, given by:\n\nThe commutation relations of the Lie algebra formula_15 are:\n\nIn three-dimensional notation, these are\n\nThe choice of basis above satisfies the relations, but other choices are possible. The multiple use of the symbol above and in the sequel should be observed.\n\nBy taking, in turn, and and by setting\n\nin the general expression , and by using the trivial relations and , it follows\n\nThese are the left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinor representations. They act by matrix multiplication on 2-dimensional complex vector spaces (with a choice of basis) and , whose elements and are called left- and right-handed Weyl spinors respectively. Given\n\ntheir direct sum as representations is formed,\n\nThis is, up to a similarity transformation, the Dirac spinor representation of formula_37 It acts on the 4-component elements of , called bispinors, by matrix multiplication. The representation may be obtained in a more general and basis independent way using Clifford algebras. These expressions for bispinors and Weyl spinors all extend by linearity of Lie algebras and representations to all of formula_37 Expressions for the group representations are obtained by exponentiation.\n\nThe classification and characterization of the representation theory of the Lorentz group was completed in 1947. But in association with the Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are yet unresolved purely mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.\n\nThe irreducible infinite-dimensional unitary representations may have indirect relevance to physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears as the little group of the Poincaré group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called \"tachyonic representations\". Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically \"understood\" in order to understand string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.\n\nOne open problem is the completion of the Bargmann–Wigner programme for the isometry group of the de Sitter spacetime . Ideally, the physical components of wave functions would be realized on the hyperboloid of radius embedded in formula_281 and the corresponding covariant wave equations of the infinite-dimensional unitary representation to be known.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2249745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249745", "title": "Burmese cuisine", "text": "Burmese cuisine\n\nBurmese cuisine is mainly an amalgam of cuisines from various regions of Myanmar. It has also been influenced by various cuisines of neighbouring countries, in particular, China, India and Thailand.\n\nModern Burmese cuisine comes in two general varieties: coastal and inland. The cuisine in the coastal areas, such as that in the main city Yangon, makes extensive use of fish and seafood-based products like fish sauce and ngapi (fermented seafood). The cuisine in inland regions, such as Upper Myanmar and hill regions, tends to use more meat and poultry although modern inland cooking too has incorporated freshwater fish and shrimp as a source of protein in several ways: fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed.\n\nBurmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (\"a thoke\"), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, long bean, lahpet (pickled tea leaves), and ngapi (fish paste). These salads have always been popular as fast foods in Burmese cities. Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Burma's national dish.\n\nA popular Burmese rhyme sums up the traditional favourites: \"\"A thee ma, thayet; a thar ma, wet; a ywet ma, lahpet\"\" (), meaning: \"Of all the fruit, the mango's the best; of all the meat, the pork's the best; and of all the leaves, lahpet's the best\".\n\nTraditionally, Burmese eat their meals from dishes on a low table, while sitting on a bamboo mat. Dishes are served simultaneously. A typical meal includes steamed rice as the main dish and accompanying dishes called \"hin\", including a curried freshwater fish or dried/salted fish dish, a curried meat or poultry dish instead, a light soup called \"hin gyo\" (), called \"chinyay hin\" () if sour, and fresh or boiled vegetables to go with a salty dish, almost invariably a curried sauce of pickled fish (\"ngapi yayjo\") in Lower Burma. Fritters such as gourd or onions in batter as well as fish or dried tofu crackers are extra.\n\nOut of respect, the eldest diners are always served first before the rest join in; even when the elders are absent, the first morsel of rice from the pot is scooped and put aside as an act of respect to one's parents, a custom known as \"u cha\" (, lit. first serve).\n\nThe Burmese eat with their right hand, forming the rice into a small ball with only the fingertips and mixing this with various morsels before popping it into their mouths. Chopsticks and Chinese-style spoons are used for noodle dishes, although noodle salads are more likely to be eaten with just a spoon. Knives and forks are used rarely in homes but will always be provided for guests and are available in restaurants and hotels. Drinks are not often served with the meal and, instead, the usual liquid accompaniment is in the form of a light broth or consommé served from a communal bowl. Outside of the meal, the Burmese beverage of choice is light green tea, \"yay nway gyan\" ().\n\nIn traditional Burmese medicine, foods are divided into two classes: heating (, \"apu za\") or cooling (, \"a-aye za\"), based on their effects on one's body system, similar to the Chinese classification of food.\n\nExamples of heating and cooling foods include:\n\nThe Burmese also hold several taboos and superstitions regarding consumption during various occasions in one's life, especially pregnancy. For instance, pregnant women are not supposed to eat chili, due to the belief that it causes children to have sparse scalp hairs.\n\nThe country's diverse religious makeup influences its cuisine, as Buddhists avoid beef and Muslims pork. Beef is considered taboo by devout Buddhists because the cow is highly regarded as a beast of burden. Vegetarian dishes are only common during the Buddhist Lent (ဝါတွင်း), a three-month Rains Retreat, as well as Uposatha days. During this time, only two meals (i.e. breakfast and lunch) are consumed before midday to observe the fasting rules (Uposatha) and abstinence from meat (သက်သတ်လွတ်, lit. 'free of killing') is observed by devout Buddhists. Throughout the rest of the year, many foods can be prepared vegetarian on request, but the bulk of Burmese food is prepared with fish or meat broth bases. Also, many of the several ethnic groups prepare at least one inherently vegetarian dish (notably cuisine from the Shan people).\n\nThe countries that border Myanmar, especially India, China and Thailand, have influenced Burmese cuisine. Indian influences are found in Burmese versions of dishes such as samosas and biryani, and Indian curries, spices and breads such as naan and paratha. Southern Indian, especially Chettiar () cuisine is also popular in cities. Chinese influences in Burmese cuisine are shown in the use of ingredients like bean curd and soya sauce, various noodles as well as in stir frying techniques. As in neighbouring Thailand and Laos, fried insects are eaten as snacks.\n\nSouthern Myanmar, particularly the area around Mawlamyine is known for its cuisine, as the Burmese proverb goes: \"Mandalay for eloquence, Mawlamyine for food, Yangon for boasting\" ().\n\nBurmese dishes are not cooked with precise recipes. The use and portion of ingredients used may vary, but the precision of timing is of utmost importance. One of the few remaining pre-colonial cookbooks is the \"Sadawset Kyan\" (, lit. \"Treatise on Royal Foods\"), written on palm leaves in 1866 during the Konbaung dynasty.\n\nDepending on the dish at hand, it may be roasted, stewed, boiled, fried, steamed, baked or grilled, or any combination of the said techniques. Burmese curries use only a handful of spices (in comparison to Indian ones) and use more garlic and ginger. Dishes are prepared with plenty of oil in the case of curries and soups, and the level of spices and herbs varies depending on the region; Kachin and Shan curries will often use more fresh herbs.\n\nIngredients used in Burmese dishes are often fresh. Many fruits are used in conjunction with vegetables in many dishes. The Burmese eat a great variety of vegetables and fruits, and all kinds of meat. A very popular vegetable is jengkol (ဒညင်းသီး), which is usually boiled or roasted and dipped in salt, oil and sometimes, cooked coconut fat.\n\nThe most common starch (staple food) in Myanmar is white rice or \"htamin\" (), which is served with accompanying meat dishes called \"hin\" (). Consumers in the northern highlands (e.g., Shan State) prefer stickier lower-amylose varieties like \"kauk hnyin\" (; glutinous rice) and \"kauk sei\", while consumers in lower delta regions preferring higher-amylose varieties like \"kauk chaw\" and \"kauk kyan\". Lower-amylose rice varieties are commonly used in Burmese snacks (\"mont\").\n\n\"Paw hsan hmwe\" (), a fragrant aromatic rice, is the most popular rice used in Burma and is rated as high as Thai jasmine rice or basmati rice. Today, Myanmar is the world's sixth largest producer of rice, though in recent times less is exported and even domestic supplies cannot be guaranteed. A purple variety of \"kauk hnyin\", known as \"nga cheik\" (), is commonly a breakfast dish. \n\nVarious types of noodles, ranging from egg and wheat noodles to rice vermicelli, are also used in salads and soups. Typically, vermicelli noodles and rice noodles are often used in soups, while thick rice and wheat noodles are used in salads. \"Palata\" (), a flaky fried flatbread related to Indian paratha, is often eaten with curried meats while \"nan bya\" (), a baked flatbread is eaten with any Indian dishes. Another favourite is \"aloo poori\" (), puffed-up fried breads eaten with potato curry.\n\nNgapi (), a paste made from salted, fermented fish or shrimp, is considered the cornerstone of any Burmese traditional meal. It is used as a main ingredient in soup base, salads, main dishes, condiments, and plainly with cooked rice as well. Different usage for various dish depends on the region.\n\nThe ngapi of Rakhine State contains no or little salt, and uses marine fish. It is used as a soup base for the Rakhine regional cuisine, \"mont di\" (). It is also used widely in cooking vegetables, fish and meat.\n\nIn the coastal Ayeyarwady and Tanintharyi divisions, the majority of ngapi is based on fresh and salty fish. Ngapi is also used as a condiment such as ngapi yay (), an essential part of Karen cuisine, which includes runny ngapi, spices and boiled fresh vegetables. The upper part of Myanmar which is the Shan State does not eat ngapi at all, instead they use fermented beans or fermented bean curd for their dishes and cuisines. Although some natives families from the lower part of Myanmar who settled in the upper parts still eat ngapi as their tradition.\n\nBurmese cuisine is full of condiments, from sweet, sour to savoury. The most popular are pickled mango, \"balachaung\" (shrimp and ngapi floss) and \"ngapi gyaw\" (fried ngapi) and preserved vegetables in rice wine (from Shan State). Ngapi plays a major part in condiments, as a dip for fresh vegetables.\n\nFermented beans, called pè ngapi, from the Shan State plays a major role in Shan cuisine. Dried bean ngapi chips are used as condiments for various Shan dishes.\n\nAnother bean-based condiment popular amongst the Bamar and the central dry region is \"pon ye gyi\" () - a thick salty black paste made from fermented soy beans. It is used in cooking, especially pork, and as a salad, with ground nut oil, chopped onions and red chili. Bagan is an important producer of \"pon ye gyi\".\n\nMyanmar has a wide range of fruits, and most are of tropical origin. However, some notable Western fruits such as strawberries are also popular. Durian, guava, and other fruits are commonly served as desserts. Other fruits include mango, banana, jackfruit, plum, lychee, papaya, pomelo, water melon, pomegranate, mangosteen, sugar-apple and rambutan.\n\nBecause a standardised system of romanisation for spoken Burmese does not exist, pronunciations of the following dishes in modern standard Burmese approximated using IPA are provided (see for details).\n\n\n\n– Source:\n\n\n– Source:\n\n\n\n"}

It is the seventh installment in the \"NBA 2K\" franchise and the successor to \"ESPN NBA 2K5\". It was released in 2005 for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360. Shaquille O'Neal of the Miami Heat is the cover athlete of the game. \"NBA 2K6\" is the predecessor to \"NBA 2K7\" in the \"NBA 2K\" series and is the first NBA 2K title to be released by 2K Sports.\n\n\"NBA 2K6\" strives to simulate the experience of the National Basketball Association. Players mostly play NBA games with any real-world team, and may customize various aspects. Players play basketball games in a variety of modes, such as quick play, online, and Association. Unlike other games in the series, the soundtrack does not feature licensed music, and instead features songs made by various artists exclusively for the game. Cover athlete Shaquille O'Neal helped in the marketing and development aspects of the game. O'Neal, among other things, provided the motion capture for several of the in-game animations.\n\n\"NBA 2K6\" received positive reviews from critics upon release. Most positive comments were concerning the player designs, commentary, overall gameplay, and soundtrack, but negative comments were directed at the controls, menus, and the lack of drastic improvements.\n\n\"NBA 2K6\" is a basketball video game that strives to simulate the experience of the National Basketball Association. Players mostly play NBA games with any real world team, and may customize certain aspects, such as the camera angle, sound levels, and sliders, which adjust the realism. Players can play quick games, as well as other game modes, including Association, where players select a team, and play through NBA seasons, customizing various aspects. Players act as the manager of the team, trading players, drafting college players, firing coaches, and playing NBA games of various levels (playoffs, regular season, practice, etc.).\n\nGameplay-wise, players may play basketball games with the whole team or one player, and will perform all the basic basketball moves that the individual player can perform. The player can dunk, pass, play in the post, run plays, call timeouts, and blocks shots (etc.). The game features many visual and presentation elements that help improve the realism; the game includes commentary, crowd animations, lighting effects, sound effects, and other small details. Kevin Harlan is the play-by-play commentator, Kenny Smith is the colour commentator, and Craig Sager is the sideline reporter.\n\nShaquille O'Neal is the cover athlete of the game. As well as being the cover athlete, O'Neal also helped with the development of the game's low post gameplay. O'Neal worked with the design teams to help create new animations, providing the motion capture for some of the pump-fakes, drop-steps, and blocks the players in the game perform.\n\nUnlike other games in the series, \"NBA 2K6\"s songs aren't licensed and are made exclusively for the game.\n\n\"NBA 2K6\" was released on September 26, 2005 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and November 16, 2005 for Xbox 360. This is the first game in the \"NBA 2K\" series to be released on the Xbox 360. It is also the first game in the series to be published by 2K Sports and not Sega.\n\n\"NBA 2K6\" received \"favorable\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nMatt Leone of 1UP.com complained of the Xbox 360 version's \"biggest setback -- it doesn't have the instant visual appeal, next-gen look, or out-and-out raw emotion that gamers want to see in a next-gen sports game. The actual mechanics of the game are quite strong (the shot stick and free throw system are perhaps the best mechanics we've seen in a basketball game to date), and it has all the depth and options we've come to expect from a veteran basketball series. If you're an optimist, \"NBA 2K6\" feels like a natural evolution of the franchise more than something that makes you want to rush out and buy it to show off your shiny new console. If you're a pessimist, well, the game isn't much more than a high-definition port of its excellent current-gen counterparts. Shouldn't we expect more out of a next-gen sports game?\" Matt Martin of Eurogamer thought the PlayStation 2 version's soundtrack was \"excellent\", praised the gameplay for its refinements and additions, liked the Association for its depth, and said the designs of the players are \"very realistic\". He said that even though some visual aspects are \"blocky and rough\", such as the crowd, the motion capture and animation is \"top notch\", which in turn allows players to move like their real life counterpart. Martin did, however, dislike the introduction of a new control scheme, calling it \"unnecessary\", and said the menus were \"ugly\" and \"broken\", wishing there was a more simple system in place.\n\nIGN's Jonathan Miller said of the Xbox 360 version: \"In the end, \"NBA 2K6\" is a solid basketball title that really rests on the laurels of its predecessors. Even though the game can look absolutely amazing at time, it's still, at its heart, the same exact game that we saw in the current generation. While \"2K6\" was a very good game on those consoles, we want to be blown away by our next-generation games. Someone who already owns the current-gen version will be hard pressed to drop $59.99 on this version, but those new to the series may want to look into it. It's still the best basketball title on the 360. Unfortunately, that isn't saying too much.\" Ronnie Hobbs of GameZone felt the gameplay of the same console version was good, but could have been better, thought the player's designs were \"unbelievably life-like\", but other visuals, such as the court, were lacking, praised the commentary, calling it \"perfection\", and liked the \"fun\" online modes, even if partially plagued by technical issues. Hobbs summed up the review by saying: \"In my opinion \"NBA 2K6\" is the best basketball game available on the 360, but whether it’s worth the $59.99 price tag is going to be up to you. The decision is a no-brainer for people who don’t already own it on the Xbox or PS2, but for those who have played it before, the slick presentation just might not be enough to warrant an upgrade.\"\n\nBob Colayco of GameSpot said of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions: \"\"NBA 2K6\" isn't for the casual basketball fan who doesn't know a pick and roll from picking his nose. The difficulty of the game, and new interface nuances, may be a little overwhelming for someone who's more attuned to something like \"NBA Jam\" or \"NBA Street\". But for those looking for a quality simulation basketball experience, \"NBA 2K6\" is a resounding slam dunk and is easily recommendable to any fan of the series or to any hardcore basketball fan in general.\" VideoGamer.com's Greg Vallentin praised the simulation gameplay and the amount of content, but criticized the Xbox 360 version for not offering enough improvements. He stated: \"\"NBA 2K6\", like its predecessors, delivers a solid simulation basketball game that's worth picking up if you've got a hankering for the sport, not to mention the fact that's it's incredibly affordable.\"\n"}

{"id": "2249760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249760", "title": "King (Tekken)", "text": "King (Tekken)\n\nThe first King used to be a ruthless street brawling orphan with no care in the world except fighting. In one of his fights, King was grievously wounded and collapsed in front of a monastery. The Marquez priests saved him from death. After recovering, King realized the error of his ways and resolved to start a new life. He became a Catholic priest and renounced his old fighting ways. He then became a man with a mission; he dreamed of building an orphanage for street children, hoping to save them from becoming the kind of person he used to be. Lacking the necessary funds to achieve his dream, King entered the first King of Iron Fist Tournament, in order to obtain them. He managed to get third place, winning enough prize money for the orphanage. He also met his rival, Armor King. After a child died in his care, King became depressed and, giving up his jaguar mask, returned to the street and became a raging alcoholic. He would have died had he not been convinced by his old friend and rival, Armor King, to again wear the jaguar mask and join The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2. King trained intensely and recovered from his alcoholism. He battled Armor King at the tournament and was defeated, not before leaving a scar below Armor King's eye. After the tournament, King participated in both pro-wrestling and martial arts tournaments to win money for his orphanage. He also taught his fighting skills to the children under his care as a means of self-defense. Sometime later on, Ogre, the God of Fighting, was awakened from an ancient ruin in Mexico by Heihachi Mishima's Tekken Force. Ogre attacked several martial artists around the world, including King, who was killed afterwards.\n\nThe second King was a street urchin who was brought up in the first King's orphanage. Until the age of 24, this wrestler worked hard with King until one day, news broke of the first King's death at the hands of Ogre. Seeing that the orphanage would crumble into ruin (the money gained from King's wrestling matches was the only funding received), this man donned the mask of King and imitated his style. However, since his technique was learned just from watching King, not training with him, he lost every competition he entered. One day, however, another man with a mask visited the new King, introducing himself as an old friend. This man revealed himself to be Armor King, who was interested in finding out if the rumors of a new King were true. For four years, the two of them trained, and the new King learned quickly, maturing into a forceful wrestler with extreme power, known as King the Second. By this time, the now 28-year-old wrestler was a worthy heir to the throne, however, he longed to punish the one responsible for the original King's death. With rumors of the \"God of Fighting\" circulating, Armor King revealed to his student that the elusive entity was the one most likely responsible. Armor King watched as the new King, fueled with rage, set his sights on avenging his foster father's death and proving himself worthy of wearing the mask.\n\nAfter the third King of Iron Fist Tournament, King (now 30) discovered that his master, Armor King, had been killed in a bar fight. The perpetrator, Craig Marduk, had been arrested in Arizona and was sent to prison. Upon Marduk's release (thanks to bribes paid by King himself), King sent a letter challenging Marduk to the tournament in \"Tekken 4\". He defeated Marduk in the fourth King of Iron Fist Tournament, sending him to the hospital, where King followed him to deliver a deadly blow. However, he stopped after seeing a portrait of Marduk and his elderly parents. King let him live, realizing how foolish he had become. King was later enraged to find out that what appeared to be Marduk was defeating opponents in a black jaguar mask (identical to Armor King's), and that he had issued a televised challenge to King. Believing it to be truly Marduk disgracing his master, King entered the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament to settle the score once and for all. King would meet Marduk in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 where he claimed to want to fight King fair and square (which confused King since what he heard and saw televised was foul play), and their subsequent battle resulted in another victory against Marduk and the start of their friendship and King's belief that it was not Marduk he saw televised. However, after the tournament, Marduk was brutally attacked, and he told King that the assailant was apparently the man he was convicted of killing, Armor King. Determined to learn the true identity of the man in Armor King's mask, King and Marduk entered the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6. While splitting up from Marduk, who went to Armor King's grave, King visit his late-his master's room, and found out from his old picture that other Armor King had a connection to him. By the time he arrived at the cemetery where Marduk and other Armor King are, King and Marduk found out that he is the vengeful younger brother of original Armor King himself. King returns as a playable character in \"Tekken 7\", with an alternate costume based on New Japan Pro Wrestling wrestler \"Rainmaker\" Kazuchika Okada being available for him in 2017. After Marduk and the younger Armor King ended up hospitalized themselves for ignoring King's peaceful treaties, King enters the tournament for not only their hospital bills and try to make amends with each other, but also the orphan he resided too. Once Marduk and Armor King II recovered, but realizing the peaceful amends might not go well if they keep fighting each other, King sets up the match between them, in order to avoid any sort of possible bloodshed, starting from suggesting Marduk to send a challenge letter titled retirement match once Armor King II fully recovered after Marduk does.\n\nKing is a character that has more of a defensive approach rather than a full blown offensive one, despite popular belief. King has to be played carefully since he has a limited range and is very unsafe. King relies on quick strikes, good movement, and a very good view on punishment. In game he is known for his speed and has an arsenal of over 200 moves in his command list. Being a professional wrestler with lucha libre influences, King has many powerful throws at his disposal, and has a lot of strong counterattacks. King is notable for his chains throws, which he's had since \"Tekken 2\", when he was one of the very few characters to have them. He also utilizes duck throws, ground throws and air throws, uncommon for characters in the \"Tekken\" series.\n\nAs of \"Tekken 5\", King seems to have drawn more wrestler-inspired moves into his repertoire, especially from superstars employed by the world-famous World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). For example, he has a stunner used by Stone Cold Steve Austin and a version of The Rock's People's Elbow and Rock Bottom. Additionally, King has been able to perform the Sharpshooter innovated by Riki Choshu, later used by Bret Hart and the Tombstone Piledriver made famous by Dynamite Kid, later used by The Undertaker and Kane since \"Tekken 2\". One of his victory poses has him side-stepping in a manner characteristic of the original Tiger Mask. King is also seen in the opening FMV of \"Tekken 5\" performing a tiger feint after being thrown across the wrestling ring by Craig Marduk, in order to prevent a collision to the outside of the ring. The maneuver is currently a trademark move of Rey Mysterio, although the original Tiger Mask pioneered its use during matches with the Dynamite Kid in the early 1980s. Other moves he uses include the Frankensteiner and Steiner Screwdriver made famous by Scott Steiner and Kenta Kobashi's Burning Hammer. Finally, King's Muscle Buster pays homage to Suguru Kinniku's \"Kinniku Buster\", which is also a finishing move of wrestler Samoa Joe.\n\nKing appears in the non-canon \"Tekken\" games \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", \"Tekken Card Challenge\", \"Tekken Advance\", \"Tekken Resolute\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", \"\" and \"Tekken Arena\" and as a playable character in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", with his official tag partner, Marduk. King also made an appearance in the Namco crossover \"Namco × Capcom\" with Felicia from the \"Darkstalkers\" series as his fighting partner. King appears as a default playable character in the free-to-play game, \"Tekken Revolution\".\n\nKing I makes a cameo appearance in \"\" as one of the tournament competitors. He has no spoken lines, and it is unknown how he progresses through the tournament. He is last seen being carried by Armor King I off the exploding Mishima resort. King II's dossier is briefly seen in the CGI film \"\" when Anna Williams opens a file containing dossiers on various persons of interest.\n\nEpoch Co. released a 1/10 scale King action figure, based on his appearance in \"Tekken 3\". The action figure comes with a removable champion belt. Epoch Co. also released a 12-inch King action figured base on his \"Tekken 4\" appearance.\n\nGaming Target placed King at #6 on their list of \"Top 11 Tekken Fighters\", complimenting his jaguar mask and noting that he's funny at times. King placed fifth in IGN's \"Ten Best Fake Wrestlers In Videogame History\", with the site citing the realism of his mask. IGN also states that \"no one can deny the intimidation his animal head puts out\". King was featured in the \"Our 10 Favorite Video Game Character Rip-Offs\" article by \"Complex\", noting his similarities to the Japanese professional wrestler Satoru Sayama and commented \"The thing that always creeped us out about King (both the original and the orphan who assumed his identity upon his death) is that his mask made it look like he had an actual jaguar head.\" \"Complex\" also compared King to El Fuerte from the \"Street Fighter\" series, predicting that he would win out of the two. \"Complex\" ranked King as \"The 12th Most Dominant Fighting Game Character\", commenting \" Anybody who knew how to pull off King's chain grabs ran the Tekken arcade cabinet\". \"Complex\" also ranked King as the 4th best \"Tekken\" character, commenting \"A fierce competitor with flashy moves, King II is famous for his massive chain throws, which drain an opponent's entire life bar.\" GameDaily placed King at #4 on their list of \"Top 25 Wrestling Characters of All Time\" and comments \"King knows how to kick butt in the Tekken series\". 1UP.com named King as one of the characters they want to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding \"The Figure 4 Leg Lock, Giant Swing, and the classic Rolling Death Cradle?

HSLDA describes itself on its website as a \"Christian organization.\" \n\nHSLDA is organized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, located in Purcellville, Virginia, which is also the home of Patrick Henry College, founded by Michael Farris in 2000.\n\nHSLDA was founded by Michael Farris in 1983 for the purpose of defending homeschooling families. At that time, homeschooling was not specifically legal in most of the states of the U.S. under compulsory education laws. Those who practiced homeschooling were often harassed or prosecuted. Through a combination of legal action and legislative lobbying, HSLDA played a large part in the legalization of homeschooling throughout the U.S.\n\nThe high point of HSLDA's existence was its central role in the 1994 defeat of language in bill H.R. 6. This bill would have required all teachers in the U.S., potentially including home educators, to have teacher certification. HSLDA used their grassroots lobbying system in each of the 50 states which coordinated members to contact their legislators about pending legislation. Their members overloaded the phone switchboards at Capitol Hill, and through the efforts of their members and other organizations, the bill was amended to remove the problematic language.\n\nHSLDA's speech and debate league broke off to form the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association in 2001. That same year, Patrick Henry College was founded by Michael Farris, who was the college's president until 2006. Today, HSLDA's 80,000+ members receive free legal assistance if they are contacted by public school officials, or need legal help in relation to their rights to homeschool.\n\nHSLDA has been criticized, from both inside and outside the larger homeschooling movement, for its ties to the Christian Right and its advocacy for various conservative political and religious causes, some of which are unrelated to homeschooling.\n\nIn 2003, HSLDA, feeling a need to educate youth in civics and politics, founded Generation Joshua. Generation Joshua (often abbreviated as \"Gen J\" by its members,) is an American Conservative Christian youth organization that aims to encourage the involvement of 11- to 19-year-olds in politics. Its members, which number 6,000 as of 2006, participate in civics education, over 60 clubs, student action teams, voter registration drives, and \"Benjamin Rush\" Awards, which offer members a chance to earn a trip to Washington, D.C., amongst other things.\n\nHSLDA and Patrick Henry College founded HSLDA Online Academy in 2009 to provide online Christian courses to homeschool families. Originally named Patrick Henry College Preparatory Academy, HSLDA Online Academy has expanded beyond college preparatory courses and now offers an array of high school classes online, including English & writing, mathematics, social studies, and foreign languages.\n\n\nHSLDA Compassion provides \"Assistance to needy home schooling families\".\n\nThe National Christian Forensics and Communications Association, or NCFCA, is a speech and debate league for homeschooled students in the United States, established in 2001 after outgrowing HSLDA, which had been running the league since it was originally established in 1995. NCFCA is now organized under its own board of directors with regional and state leadership coordinating tournaments and other activities.\n\nPatrick Henry College, or PHC, is a private, non-denominational Protestant college, founded by HSLDA, that focuses on teaching classical liberal arts and government, located in Purcellville, Virginia. It is the first college in America founded specifically for Christian home-schooled students. The school was incorporated in 1998 by Michael Farris. It officially opened September 20, 2000 with 92 students, and has since grown to approximately 325 students.\n\nCalabretta v. Floyd\n\nCamdenton R-III School District v.

Baker and Catherine McCallum. He graduated from Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, in 1844. His family has long been associated with the college, and the Baker Sports Complex there is named for them.\n\nInitially, Baker set up a law practice in Lumberton, North Carolina. But, after a bout with typhoid fever, he determined to move to a warmer climate and traveled to Florida on horseback. He re-established his practice of the law for a time at Old Columbia on the Suwannee River. But, he then moved to the town of Alligator, where he encouraged the residents to change the uninviting name to the modern Lake City.\n\nIn 1852, Baker was named State Attorney for the Suwannee Circuit, and served as a delegate to the Whig National Convention in Baltimore. There, despite the protests of the Florida delegation, the party nominated General Winfield Scott for President of the United States. Scott was extremely unpopular in the state due to his prosecution of the Seminole Wars, and the decision to put him at the top of the party's ticket alienated many voters. So, it was no surprise in 1856 when Baker failed to win election to the U.S. Congress as a Know Nothing-Whig candidate despite his extensive horseback travels across the state.\n\nIn 1859, Baker succeeded in winning election as the state judge for the 4th Judicial District, which met in Suwannee. The same year, he married Miss Fanny Gilchrist.\n\nDuring the tumultuous Election of 1860, Judge Baker supported the failed Constitutional Union ticket of Bell and Everett and opposed Florida's secession after the election of Abraham Lincoln. But, once the secession ordinance passed, he loyally supported the decision of his adopted state.\n\nJudge Baker was still on the bench in 1861, when the Florida legislature created Baker County in his honor. The following year, the same body selected him to serve as one of the state's two senators in the Confederate Congress. He moved to Richmond, Virginia, for the duration of the U.S. Civil War.\n\nReturning to Florida after the defeat of the South in 1865, Baker was quickly appointed a Justice of the Florida Supreme Court by Governor David S. Walker. However, ratification of the state's Reconstruction constitution in 1868 forced his resignation and return to private practice. Over the next several years, he gained his greatest professional reputation for litigation associated with the disposition of lands held by the state's Internal Improvement Fund—which had been created in 1855 to attract Northern capital and spur development.\n\nBy 1876, Baker was an active member of the state's Democratic Executive Committee, and worked hard to bring about an end to the Reconstruction era in Florida. In 1881, he was returned as a judge on the state's 4th Judicial Circuit by Governor William Bloxham. He was re-appointed in 1885 by his successor Governor Edward A. Perry. But, he resigned due to declining health in 1890.\n\nJudge Baker retired in Jacksonville, where he became an elder in the Presbyterian church. He died at his home in that city one month shy of his seventy-first birthday, and was buried at the nearby Evergreen Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and five children, including two sons who followed in his professional footsteps as prominent Florida attorneys. Members of his family also gained prominence as the founders of Florida Rock Industries .\n"}

{"id": "2249807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249807", "title": "Houston Police Department", "text": "Houston Police Department\n\nThe Houston Police Department (HPD) is the primary law enforcement agency serving the City of Houston, Texas, United States and some surrounding areas. With approximately 5,300 officers and 1,200 civilian support personnel it is the fifth-largest municipal police department, serving the fourth-largest city in the United States. Its headquarters are at 1200 Travis in Downtown Houston.\n\nHPD's jurisdiction often overlaps with several other law enforcement agencies, among them the Harris County Sheriff's Office and the Harris County Constable Precincts. HPD is the largest municipal police department in Texas.\n\nAccording to the HPD's website, \"The mission of the Houston Police Department is to enhance the quality of life in the City of Houston by working cooperatively with the public and within the framework of the U.S. Constitution to enforce the laws, preserve the peace, reduce fear and provide for a safe environment.\"\n\nHouston was founded by brothers Augustus and John Kirby Allen in 1836 and incorporated as a city the next year, 1837. As the city quickly grew, so did the need for a cohesive law enforcement agency. The Houston Police Department was founded in 1841. The first HPD badge issued bore the number \"1.\"\n\nThe early part of the 20th century was a time of enormous growth for both Houston and for the Houston Police Department. Due to growing traffic concerns in downtown Houston, the HPD purchased its first automobile in 1910 and created its first traffic squad during that same year. Eleven years later, in 1921, the HPD installed the city's first traffic light. This traffic light was manually operated until 1927, when automatic traffic lights were installed.\n\nAs Houston became a larger metropolis throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the HPD found itself growing and acquiring more technology to keep up with the city's fast pace. The first homicide division was established in 1930. During that same year, the HPD purchased newer weapons to arm their officers: standard issue .44 caliber revolvers and two Thompson submachine guns. In 1939, the department proudly presented its first police academy class. The Houston Police Officers Association (HPOA) was created in 1945. This organization later became the Houston Police Officers Union. The first African American woman police officer on the force, Margie Duty, joined the HPD in 1953, starting in the Juvenile Division.\n\nThroughout the turbulent 1960s and 1970s, the HPD also experienced its own highs and lows. The HPD bomb squad was created in 1965. Informally, it is known to have existed since 1956 as Sgt. 'Army' Armstrong, was a one-man Bomb Squad, responding to any explosive related event. The next year, 1967, saw massive riots at Texas Southern University. During the riots, one officer was killed and nearly 500 students were arrested. It was as a result of these riots that the still-active Community Relations Division was created within the HPD. In 1970, the Helicopter Patrol Division was created with three leased helicopters. That year also marked the department's first purchase of bulletproof vests for their officers. The HPD's first Special Weapons and Tactical Squad (SWAT) was formed in 1975.\n\nIn 1982, the Houston Police Department appointed its first African-American chief of police, Lee P. Brown, who succeeded B.K.Johnson. Brown served as chief from 1982 to 1990 and later became the City of Houston's first African-American mayor in 1998. While Brown was considered a successful chief, he also earned the unflattering moniker \"Out of Town Brown\" for his many lengthy trips away from Houston during his tenure.\n\nBrown's appointment was controversial from the start. Traditional HPD officers frowned upon Brown because he was an outsider from Atlanta, Georgia where he was the police commissioner; to become the police chief in Houston, an officer has to advance through the rank and file although the \"good old boy\" culture was prevalent.\n\nThe HPD paved a new road again in 1990 when Mayor Kathy Whitmire appointed Elizabeth Watson as the first female chief of police. Elizabeth Watson served from 1990 to 1992 and was followed by Sam Nuchia, who served as police chief from 1992 to 1997. In 1997, Clarence O. Bradford was appointed as chief. In 2002, Bradford was indicted and later acquitted of perjury charges, stemming from an incident in which he allegedly lied under oath about cursing fellow officers. Since late 2007, Bradford was the Democratic nominee for Harris County District Attorney where he will be facing a Republican opponent (either Kelly Siegler or Patricia Lykos; the incumbent, Charles A. 'Chuck' Rosenthal, resigned prior to withdrawing his candidacy due to an e-mail scandal). Bradford faced Patricia Lykos and lost the election; he later campaigned in 2009 for a Houston City Council at-large council seat vacated by Ronald C. Green, who ran for controller. Bradford's city council seat tenure as of 2015 is term limited under the City of Houston charter where he was listed as a viable candidate for Mayor of the City of Houston since the incumbent, Annise Parker, was in her final term. In 2016, Sylvester Turner was elected Houston's mayor after defeating Adrian Garcia, former Houston Police Officer and Harris County Sheriff, and others. It was Garcia, a relatively late entry into the race, who missed out on potential endorsements from multiple police agency officer's unions and associations in Harris County that had already endorsed Turner before Garcia, who was by most accounts a popular and well-respected County Sheriff and community leader, entered the race. (Garcia later campaigned for TX Congressional District 29 in the Democrat primary and lost to incumbent Gene Green; Garcia's successor on the Houston City Council, Ed Gonzalez, did campaign for Harris County Sheriff and won in the 2016 election season defeating Ron Hickman, who was appointed by Harris County Commissioners Court to serve out Garcia's unexpired term.) Likely, many of these police agency associations, as well as other major endorsers, such as The Houston Chronicle, who had already declared their support for Turner, would have likely backed Adrian Garcia. This, as much as anything else, probably cost Garcia the election. Sylvester Turner became Mayor of Houston in January 2016.\n\nUnder Mayor Turner, Houston Police Department has seen a mass exodus of officers, due in large part to ongoing conflict between the Mayor's office and the Houston Police Department's Pension Fund Management. In early 2017, changes were made to the police officers pension fund, which resulted in many long-serving officers to lose part of their contributions, which are being funneled back into the aggregate fund in order to bolster the fund's holdings. Multiple controversies over this and other issues related to the pension, retirement rank and calculations of pension amounts have resulted in a substantial number of police officers retiring from HPD before the new pension policies went into effect. A substantial number of officers are continuing to retire or resign, causing the number of police officers who are actually and actively working in some capacity as licensed peace officers to be in drastic decline. Among those divisions hardest hit includes the Patrol Divisions. While Houston Police Department spokespersons repeatedly declined to provide solid or specific numbers of patrol officers actively \"working the streets,\" current officers in multiple areas (Patrol Districts) frequently complain about a lack of manpower, inadequate and slow-to-respond back-up units, and citizens join these officers in reporting increasingly poor response times and inadequate police presence on active scenes. These officers worry about increased safety concerns and fears related to greater danger to the officers because of the lack of manpower, especially during the night shift. Sometimes, officers working the overnight shift must contend with only one or two units covering an entire \"beat,\" areas which are subdivisions of Districts. It is now routine, for example, for officers covering a beat to have units who are assigned two or three beats away called away from their beats to respond to calls for assistance or extra manpower. This not only impacts response time to a fellow officer who is calling for urgent help, but it then leaves other beats with reduced and often no coverage for their own beats while they are responding to an officer in another beat. These situations are now commonplace in many Police Districts. A recent estimate given by a high-ranking supervisor for HPD was that there are approximately 3,500 sworn officers (the total umber of actively employed, licensed peace officers in all Divisions and administrative positions) currently serving as Houston Police Officers. By comparison, this is roughly equal to the number of sworn HPD officers employed 25 – 30 years ago. While the Mayor's Office and newly appointed Houston Police Chief Arturo \"Art\" Acevedo's (Formerly Chief of Police for Austin, Texas) Office maintain that they are \"filling the gaps,\" at the current rate of attrition (officers leaving HPD via retirement and resignation) compared to the number of new officers graduating from the HPD Academy (the \"classroom\" portion of which lasts approximately six months and the \"practical\" portion of which lasts another six months), even with multiple classes overlapping (approximately 4 classes of 50 cadets each) it will take more than a decade, using the most \"optimistic\" projections, just to return The Houston Police Department to the often-promoted number of 5,000 police officers. When one is reminded of that other often-quoted statistic that Houston is the \"fastest growing city in the nation\" (actually, recent reports from the US Census Bureau show Houston dropping to number two last year, thanks in large part to the current oil bust) and that as the fourth largest city in the United States (provided that Houston has not already overtaken Chicago's population, which by some estimates it has), simply bringing Houston's police force back to 5,000 officers after 10 more years of substantial growth (Houston added an estimated 85,000+ individuals during 2016), Houston could potentially add 1 to 1.5 million people during the next decade of growth. By comparison, the Chicago Police Department has approximately 12,000+ sworn officers. These numbers are similar on both their Wikipedia page as well as the Chicago Police Department's website. So in comparison between these two cities with virtually identical populations, Chicago has four times the number of police officers and shows a negative growth trend (their population is declining over the last several years) while Houston, with 3,000 sworn officers, has the number two growth trend of any city in the nation.\n\nSince 1992, the Houston City Marshal's division, Houston Airport Police, and Houston Park Police were absorbed into HPD. In early 2004, during Mayor Bill White's first term in office, HPD absorbed the Neighborhood Protection division from the City of Houston Planning Department, which was renamed the Neighborhood Protection Corps in 2005. Annise Parker, Mayor White's successor, moved the Neighborhood Protection Corps into the Department of Neighborhoods when the new city division was established in August 2011 - the NPC was renamed as the Inspections and Public Service division of the Department of Neighborhoods.\n\nIn November 2002, the CBS local TV station KHOU began broadcasting a multi-part investigation into the accuracy of the HPD Crime Lab's findings. Particularly of interest to the reporters were criminal cases that involved DNA analysis and serological (body fluid) testing. Night after night journalists David Raziq, Anna Werner and Chris Henao presented case after case in which the lab's work was dangerously sloppy or just plain wrong and may have been sending the innocent to prison while letting the guilty go free. As a result of those broadcasts, at the end of the week the Houston Police Department declared they would have a team of independent scientists audit the lab and its procedures. However, the audit's findings were so troublesome that one month later, in mid- December, HPD closed the DNA section of the laboratory. Not only did the audit bolster KHOU's report but also found that samples were contaminated and the lab's files were very poorly maintained. The audit revealed that a section of the lab's roof was leaking into sample-containment areas, lab technicians were seriously undereducated or unqualified for their jobs, samples had been incorrectly tagged, and samples had been contaminated through improper handling. Worse, many people had been convicted and sent to prison based upon the evidence contained in the crime lab. \"The New York Times\" asked the question, \"Worst Crime Lab in the Country?\" in a March 2003 article.\n\nBeginning in early 2003, the HPD Crime Lab began cooperating with outside DNA testing facilities to review criminal cases involving cases or convictions associated with Crime Lab evidence. However this again came as a result of some prompting investigatory work done by the TV station KHOU. Not long after their first broadcasts, reporters David Raziq, Anna Werner and Chris Henao got an e-mail from a local mother. She was desperate. She told them that her son, Josiah Sutton, had been tried for rape in 1999 and found guilty based upon HPD Crime Lab testing. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. So KHOU began to take an intensive look at the Sutton case. Raziq and Werner analyzed the HPD lab's DNA report with the help of DNA expert Bill Thompson of the University of California-Irvine. They found terrible and obvious mistakes in the report that the lab should have known about. When the reporters presented this new information to the local jurists who had helped convict Sutton, they were mortified. Not long after that broadcast, the HPD agreed to an immediate retest of the DNA evidence in the Sutton case. Those tests showed the DNA collected in the case did not belong to Sutton. He was released from prison in March 2003 and given a full pardon in 2004.\n\nAs a result of the scandal, nine Crime Lab technicians were disciplined with suspensions and one analyst was terminated. However, that analyst was fully reinstated to her previous position in January 2004, less than one month after her December 2003 termination. Many HPD supervisors and Houston residents called for more stringent disciplinary actions against the Crime Lab employees. However, the city panel responsible for disciplining the lab technicians repeatedly resisted these arguments and instead reduced the employees' punishments . Irma Rios was hired in 2003 as Lab Director, replacing Interim Lab Director Frank Fitzpatrick.\n\nIn May 2005, the Houston Police Department announced that with much effort and coordination on their part, they had received national accreditation through the American Society of Crime Lab Directors (ASCLD). The ASCLD stated that the lab had met or exceeded standards for accreditation in all areas except DNA. Through independent research and testing, it was determined in January 2006 that of 1,100 samples reviewed, 40% of DNA samples and 23% of blood evidence samples had serious problems. On June 11, 2007, the HPD crime lab reported its DNA section had gained full accreditation from ASCLD.\n\nIn the October 6, 2007 The \"Houston Chronicle\" published allegations of Employees cheating on an open-book proficiency test.\n\nThe Safe Clear program was implemented by Mayor Bill White on January 1, 2005 as a joint venture between the City of Houston and the Houston Police Department. The intention of the program was to decrease the freeway accidents and traffic jams that occurred due to stalled drivers. Select tow truck companies across the city were authorized to tow a stalled vehicle as soon as possible after being notified by an HPD officer. Persons having their vehicle towed were provided with a Motorist's Bill of Rights and were required to pay a sum to the City of Houston after the towing had taken place.\n\nThe program was initially very unpopular among Houston residents. Frequent complaints were that the program unfairly punished lower-income motorists by enforcing a high towing fee and that the program could potentially damage vehicles that required special tow trucks and equipment to be safely towed away. Other complaints were that stranded motorists did not have an option to choose their own garage. The city and the HPD addressed these concerns with program improvements that provided funds to pay for short tows that removed stalled vehicles from the freeway and then allowed drivers to choose their own garage and tow companies once they were safely off the freeway.\n\nStudies released in February 2006 indicate that Safe Clear has been successful during its fledgling year. There were 1,533 fewer freeway accidents in 2005, a decrease of 10.4% since Safe Clear's implementation.\n\nIn December 2004, Chief Hurtt (when he was the former chief of Oxnard, CA) stated that when the city of Oxnard installed their red light cameras, it has claimed that red light running decreased dramatically although Houston was in the process of favoring red light camera enforcement.\nThe history of red light camera enforcement goes back to the 78th Texas Legislature where this measure was voted down although a transportation bill authored by a member of the Texas House of Representatives had an inclusion of red light camera enforcement. In December 2004, the Houston City Council unanimously voted for red light camera enforcement although Texas State Representative Gary Elkins (R-TX) introduced legislation to deter Houston from amending its city charter for the red light camera rule to be enforced. This measure failed in the Texas Senate although in 2005, four intersections in downtown Houston were used as testbeds for red light camera equipment. After a contract was approved, the enforcement went online September 1, 2006 to which those running a red light (there are 50 locations) are fined a $75 civil fine as opposed to a $225 moving violation which goes against the vehicle operator.\n\nThere are fifty intersections with red light cameras in the city with cameras (twenty intersections were added where dual cameras were installed). A majority of them are located at a thoroughfare at a freeway intersection - primarily in the Galleria and southwest Houston. During a Houston City Council meeting on 6.11.08, council member James Rodriguez suggested the installation of an additional 200 cameras.\n\nA voter referendum during the 2010 Texas gubernatorial elections to eliminate red-light cameras passed. The referendum that passed in November 2010 was later invalidated by U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes June 17, 2011 citing that the referendum violated the city charter despite the contract with American Traffic Solutions, which provided the camera equipment. The cameras were expected to be reactivated after midnight on July 24, 2011; plans were underway to have this judicial ruling heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\nOn July 2, 2007, Mayor Bill White started a new program called the \"Mobility Response Team\".\nStaffed by traffic enforcement officers patrol within the loop clearing traffic problems. They report traffic light outages, issue parking citations, help clear and direct traffic around minor accidents, or traffic jams during special events in the area. The duties will only involve surface streets and not the freeways and will be using scooters and police cruisers fitted with yellow flashing lights rather than the typical red and blue lights.\n\nThis was part of the mayor's plan to improve mobility in city and is the first of its kind in the United States. The city's mobility response team cost $1.8 million a year to operate.\n\nHurtt spent around $24 million on overtime pay through 2010. That money would continue to bolster an understaffed force as police commanders try to increase their ranks.\nThe overtime that is planned would be about equal to 500,000 police hours of which would help bolster various departments including, vice, Westside patrol and traffic enforcement, among other areas including a new 60-member crime reduction unit that will serve as a citywide tactical squad.\n\nThe police chief said the effort will put more officers to work immediately in troubled areas of the city such as Third Ward and Acres Homes, where the bodies of seven women have been found in the past two years.\n\nThe crime rate, particularly for violent offenses, since the latter part of 2005, when an influx of hurricane evacuees increased the city's population by more than 100,000, and incidents spiked in certain neighborhoods.\n\nIn the morning of May 2, 2020, HPD's helicopter crashed in an apartment complex in north Houston, killing officer Jason Knox and injuring another. \n\nThe Houston Police Department is headed by a chief of police appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. This position is aided by two executive assistant chiefs, ten assistant chiefs, 44 captains, approximately 220 lieutenants and 900 sergeants. HPD headquarters, 1200 Travis, is in Downtown Houston. The current Chief of Police is Hubert \"Art\" Acevedo.\n\nHPD divides the city into 13 patrol divisions. Each division is divided into one or more districts and each district is divided further into one or more beats. Stations are operated and staffed 24 hours a day. HPD also operates 29 store front locations throughout the city. These store fronts are not staffed 24 hours a day, and generally open at either 7:00 or 8:00 AM, and close at 5:00 PM. Downtown Houston is patrolled by the Downtown Division, and the Houston Airport System facilities have their own divisions.\n\nA map of all stations and store front locations can be found at the HPD web site.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Police\n\nThe Houston Police Department administrative offices and investigative offices are at 1200 Travis in Downtown Houston. The 61 Riesner site houses the HPD central patrol office, the municipal jail, and the transportation department. The 33 Artesia facility houses the communication and maintenance facilities. In December 2013 the city announced that it has plans to build a new headquarters for HPD and the city courts.\n\nBy the end of 1989 the police department had established 19 storefronts and planned to open 10 additional storefronts in 1990.\n\nAs of 2015, the department uses a large number of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors as their main fleet of patrol vehicles which was first ordered in 1996 replacing the Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (used between 1988 and in patrol service until 2004 (replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria squads to 1987 along with M-bodied Mopars (primarily the Plymouth Gran Fury (both R and M platform) last used in 1989)). They have Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor models from dating from 1999 to 2011. Since Ford no longer produces the \"crown Vic\" (procurement of the Crown Vic ended in April 2011 when the orders were filled), The department has chosen to phase in the Chevy Tahoe PPV and Ford Police Interceptor Utility(Explorer) as the successor to the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. The department is continuing to test new Chevy Caprice PPV models and Ford Taurus Interceptors (including the fifth-generation Explorer) as well - the test mules as of 2015 have been integrated into the mainstream vehicle fleet. It also uses pickup trucks from the Big Three, such as the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford F150, and Dodge Ram for their Truck Enforcement Unit. There is also a small fleet of Dodge Chargers and Chevrolet Camaros, which are mainly used as \"stealth traffic patrol vehicles\" (which is part of the Traffic Enforcement division). The stealth vehicles are plain white police cars with a slicktop roof and gray, reflective \"HOUSTON POLICE\" graphics on the side as well as on the front bumper, and hidden emergency lights that are driven by uniformed officers. The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is also used in this manner - as of late 2011 the stealth patrol vehicles are now painted black. The stealth squads have been supplemented with 14 Ford Taurus Police Interceptors in early 2014 (painted black). Solo (motorcycle) officers use Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The patrol vehicle livery, painted white with blue lettered graphics dating back to 1999 (which replaced the Columbia Blue livery last used in 1998 and retired a decade later), is being phased out for a black and white color scheme where 100 vehicles are painted from $60,000 earmarked from asset forfeiture funds (under HPD policy the previous livery is still used in service until official retirement). HPD squads are usually retired when the vehicle reaches 100,000 miles (they are not reassigned to reserve or secondary duty as with the Austin or San Antonio PD after 80,000 miles) - some squads dating over 10 model years old which are no longer used for patrol duty are usually reassigned either as bait squads (HPD will park an unmanned squad in a high crime area or illegal dumping site) or the Mobility Response Division - the older HPD fleet used by Mobility Response have been retired and replaced with Ford F150 extended cab pickup trucks from the Truck Enforcement Unit. Around 2016 the Houston Chronicle revealed that some of the older squads are still in service but the breakdown rate has increased - a 100,000 mile marked squad (or 120,000 mile unmarked vehicle) has the life expectancy of an automobile with 300,000 miles with regular maintenance. At the time HPD ordered 50 new Ford Police Interceptor Utilities for the command staff but not the mainstream vehicle fleet (the department has procured newer vehicles but the budget crunch has taken in a few new orders whilst the older squads are still operational. A budget crunch in major Texas cities is partly to blame where municipal budgets are usually slashed including priority spending for first responders. Most modern HPD Patrol cars today are Blue and white saying \" HOUSTON POLICE\" on the side.Newer models use a mixture of black and white paint now with 911 EMERGENCY listed on the rear side of the car or truck.\n\nThe Houston Police Helicopter Division celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2010. The unit was formed with three leased Schweizer 269B helicopters and has flown almost exclusively Schweizer or McDonnell Douglas helicopters. With 16 helicopters, the division is the second largest air support unit in the United States after the Los Angeles Police Department. In 2008 the department acquired new MD500E helicopters. The department also has Schweizer 300 helicopters for training.\n\nThe helicopter division patrols about a area. HPD has two helicopters in the air for up to 21 hours a day. All pilots and tactical flight officers are sworn Houston police officers.\n\nMost Houston police officers now carry SIG Sauer P229, SIG Sauer P226, SIG Sauer P220, Glock 22, Glock 23 or the Smith & Wesson M&P40 .40 (S&W) caliber semi-automatic handguns. They are also armed with X26 Tasers. Tenured officers whose handguns are \"grandfathered in\" are still allowed to carry their weapons after the mandated .40 (S&W) requirement. This allows some officers to still carry .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .45 Colt revolvers. Chief Charles McClelland while chief, carried a Colt 1911 Mk. IV Government Model as his sidearm. Officers are also allowed to carry an AR-15 rifle, Ruger Mini-14 rifle, Remington 870 shotgun, Benelli M1 Super 90 shotgun and a M2 Super 90 shotgun. The SWAT unit uses several kinds of automatic weapons, and was the first local law enforcement agency in the United States to adopt the FN P90. Current Chief Art Acevedo carries a Smith & Wesson M&P and it is also the standard sidearm of the Austin, Texas Police department from which he came.\n\nAs of November 2013, HPD has allowed officers to carry pistols chambered in .45ACP. The Glock 21, Sig Sauer 227, and Smith & Wesson M&P 45 are approved sidearms for uniformed officers. Plainclothes officers may carry the Glock 30 and Smith & Wesson M&P 45c. Also in 2013, HPD has begun to issue the Taser X2 in place of the Taser X26.\n\nAs of September 2015, M1911 pistols in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP are authorized for uniformed officers as well as 9mm and .45 ACP versions of all previously authorized pistols. Plainclothes officers are now authorized to carry the Glock 43 or Smith & Wesson M&P Shield as their primary weapon.\n\nAs of January 2016, the Sig P320 in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP is approved for uniformed officers to carry. Also, EOTech electronic optical sights have been removed from the list of red dot sights that are allowed on patrol rifles. However, Aimpoint electronic optical sights are still allowed.\n\nOfficers graduating from Cadet Class 231 or later are only authorized to carry the Sig Sauer P320, the Glock 17, or the Smith & Wesson M&P in 9mm as their primary weapon while in uniform.\n\nThe Houston Police Department operates a non-residential, Monday through Friday police academy from which all cadets must graduate in order to become Houston police officers.\n\nCadet classes last approximately six months and consist of the basic peace officer course as required by the Texas Commission of Law Enforcement (TCOLE) and HPD specific instruction. In the past, HPD has held lateral classes for officers from other agencies to become HPD officers. Lateral classes are for Police Officers who are looking to switch over to a different jurisdiction and to get credit for their experience in the field.\n\nCadets are required to pass HPD instruction in academics, firearms, driving, physical training, and defensive tactics.\n\nProbationary police officers (PPOs) select which available training station they will go to based on their Academy class rankings.\n\nThe following patrol stations are considered training stations:\n\nThe following patrol stations are not considered training stations:\nAfter graduation he/she is placed on a six months probation period where they will be working on a Field Training Program.\nThe Field Training Program consists of six phases and last about 12–16 weeks. The Field Training occurs in the following sequence:\n\nPPOs that successfully complete Phase 4 are not required to continue onto Phase 5 and 6. PPOs that are required to continue onto Phase 5 are given remedial training in the category or categories that they are deemed deficient in. If a PPO fails Phase 6, they are disqualified from becoming a police officer, and must reapply to the department. Phase 6 is required to ensure that they have corrected the deficiency.\n\nAfter completing the Field Training Program, PPOs are partnered with mentor officers for approximately 4 months.Their first assignment after completing Field Training is a Patrol Officer. The Mentor Program is not a graded or pass/fail program. Instead, it is designed to give PPOs additional guidance before they are allowed to patrol on their own after their probationary period.\n\nThe probationary period for PPOs last for one year from the date that they were hired on as cadets. At their one-year anniversary, officers become civil service protected.\n\nOfficers select their permanent assignments based on Academy class rank. Officers must serve in their permanent assignment for at least one year before they can transfer to another division.\n\nNew sergeants and lieutenants receive leadership in-service training colloquially known as going to \"Sergeant School\" and \"Lieutenant School\", respectively.\n\nNewly promoted sergeants must undergo a separate field training program. They are trained for 3 weeks on one shift and then another 3 weeks on another shift. They are then evaluated for 1 week on one shift and then for another week on another shift. This training is designed to ensure that they can perform effectively as new supervisors.\n\nNew sergeants pick available training and permanent assignments based on their ranking on their promotion list.\n\nDemand for use of Vietnamese-speaking officers increased in the 1980s as the city's Vietnamese population increased. By 1997, according to Sergeant Bill Weaver, in addition to English and Spanish, HPD had officers who had fluency in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Vietnamese. HPD has a dispatch system tracking officers speaking languages other than English and Spanish.\n\nThese are the current ranks of the Houston Police Department:\n\nThose with the rank of sergeant or above are supervisors and are issued gold badges whereas officers are issued silver badges.\n\nLieutenants and above may also be referred to as commanders. For example, they hold position titles including \"shift commander\", \"night commander\", \"division commander\", etc. They are also exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act due to their managerial responsibilities.\n\nAfter 12 years of HPD service and obtaining a TCOLE Master Peace Officer certification, an officer becomes a senior officer. This rank was created in 2001.\n\nPromotion to sergeant through captain all occur via a civil service formula that factors into account performance on the written examination for the respective rank, assessment score, years of service, and level of higher education or 4 years of military service. Officers are eligible to take the sergeant's promotion exam after 5 years of service. Sergeants and lieutenants are eligible to take the promotion exam of the next higher rank after 2 years of service in their current rank. Candidates for lieutenant must hold at least 65 college hours or an associate degree. Candidates for the rank of commander must hold at least a bachelor's degree.\n\nAssistant chiefs and executive assistant chiefs are appointed by the chief with the approval of the mayor. Such individuals must hold at least a master's degree and have 5 years of HPD service.\n\nIt is not required to move through every rank below to achieve a higher rank. For example, many officers promote directly to sergeant without ever being senior officers. Also, many assistant chiefs are promoted directly from the rank of lieutenant. Councilman C.O. Bradford was promoted to assistant chief from the rank of sergeant. Jack Heard was promoted to chief from the rank of sergeant. It is entirely possible to become chief as an outsider such as in the case of Lee Brown, who went on to become mayor, and Harold Hurtt.\n\nDefunct ranks include detective, captain, inspector, and deputy chief. In the mid 1980s, all active duty detectives were reclassified to sergeants. Originally, officers could choose to promote to detective (investigator) or sergeant (supervisor) which were both immediately below lieutenant.\n\nCurrently, the title of \"Detective\" more accurately refers to certain investigators. Eligibility requirements include:\nPer policy, when an investigator from the concerned investigative division arrives to a patrol scene, the investigator shall take charge of the investigation.\n\nIn 2018, the rank of captain was converted to commander with a change of rank insignia from double gold bars to one gold star.\n\nGeorge Seber was promoted to assistant chief in either 1953 or 1954 and was second in command of the department. However, that rank ended when he left in 1969. Inspectors were then the second highest ranking and Chief Pappy Bond converted that rank to deputy chief. After the rank of assistant chief was re-instituted in the mid 1970s, the deputy chief rank was third highest for a time. Circa 1990, the rank of deputy chief was abolished. In 1998, the executive assistant chief rank was created, making it the second highest rank.\n\nSupervisors may also be appointed under certain circumstances to act in the next higher rank during an absence from duty of their supervisor. For example, a patrol sergeant might be appointed as the acting lieutenant (shift commander) if there would be no other lieutenants on duty within that division. Per policy, officers cannot be appointed as acting sergeants (supervisors).\n\nSince the establishment of the Houston Police Department, 115 officers have died in the line of duty. The following list also contains officers from the Houston Airport Police Department and the Houston City Marshal's Office, which were merged into HPD.\nThe causes of death are as follows:\n\nThe Houston Police Officer's Memorial, designed by Texas artist Jesús Moroles, opened in 1990 to honor the duty and sacrifices of the department.\n\nBreakdown of the makeup of the rank and file of HPD:\n\nIn May 1977, Joe Campos Torres (1954 - May 5, 1977) was a 23-year-old Vietnam veteran who was arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's predominantly Hispanic East End neighborhood. Six Houston police officers took Torres to a spot called \"The Hole\" next to Buffalo Bayou and beat him.The officers then took Torres to the city jail, where they were ordered to take him to the hospital. Instead of taking Torres to the hospital like they were told, the officers brought him back to the banks of Buffalo Bayou, where he was pushed into the water. Torres' body was found two days later.\n\nChad Holley was an Elsik High School sophomore at the time of his arrest in March 2010, as an alleged burglary suspect, which was preceded by, what some say, was an abuse by HPD. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to probation until he turned 18. The incident also resulted in 12 officers disciplined, fired, or charged. All appealed the decisions.\nOfficer Andrew Blomberg, the first of four officers to go on trial, has been acquitted of charges of \"Official Oppression\".\n\nIn September 2010, Officer Tracie Bell was sentenced to sixteen years in prison for stealing over $100,000 from American Red Cross funds earmarked for survivors of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Bell and another officer contracted with the charity to run a basketball camp for young people displaced by the storms. They inflated the number of persons they claimed attended in order to gain additional funds.\n\nIn April 2011, Sergeant Ruben Trejo crashed his private vehicle into a school bus while driving to work. Tests showed he had twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood. Sergeant Trejo was fired.\n\nIn August 2011, press reports indicated that the department held more than 7,000 rape kits that had never been tested. Some of these kits dated back twenty years.\n\nIn October 2012, Officer Abraham Joseph was sentenced to life in prison for raping a handcuffed woman in the back of his police car. During the sentencing phase of the trial, two other women came forward to claim the policeman also raped them.\n\nIn June 2013, a grand jury refused to indict Officer Matthew Marin after he shot and killed Brian C. Claunch on 22 September 2012. Claunch, who was mentally ill and confined to a wheelchair threatened a police officer with a ballpoint pen. Marin then killed him.\n\nIn August 2013, Officer Darrin DeWayne Thomas pleaded guilty to the theft of $700. Thomas was caught in an October 2010 sting operation where he thought he had been left with the money unobserved. He was sentenced to two years of probation and agreed to surrender his Texas peace officer's license. After he finishes his period of probation, he will have no criminal record.\n\nIn October 2013, Officer Adan Jimenez Carranza plead guilty to \"attempted sexual assault\" for raping a woman in the back of his patrol car after investigating a minor traffic accident. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and twenty years on the state's sex offender registry. Carranza could be eligible for parole in six months.\n\nIn late February 2020, the Harris County District Attorney ask local courts to appoint lawyers to represent sixty-nine people who had been convicted based on the testimony of Officer Gerald Goines. Goines had made false statements to obtain a warrant the resulted in two deaths in January 2019. This misconduct through into doubt a number of legal actions based upon his testimony.\n\nBreakdown of the types of academic degrees held by HPD members:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Versions of the game were also released for the Sega Master System and Game Gear by the Flying Edge division of Acclaim. The game is loosely based on the story arc of the same name, which was published in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #334-339 in the early 1990s.\n\nDoctor Octopus is setting his master plan into action to take over the world with the help of the Sinister Six. Spider-Man manages to defeat all of them and save the world.\n\nThe player controls Spider-Man through six side-scrolling levels, with a member of the Sinister Six (Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin, and Doctor Octopus) at the end of each level as a boss. Spider-Man can jump, punch, kick, duck, climb certain walls and trees, shoot webs to swing on and collect web fluid to shoot square web projectiles.\n\nThe levels are generally straightforward side-scrolling action, although occasionally a particular item such as key or a detonator has to be found.\n\nSpider-Man has only one life in the NES version, but also has one continue.

It is located next to Zeppelinfeld. It also neighbors the Nuremberg Arena.\n\nSince 1966, it has been home stadium to the German Bundesliga club 1. FC Nürnberg. During the 1972 Summer Olympics, it hosted six football matches. In 1967, it hosted the European Cup Winners' Cup final between Rangers and Bayern Munich. Bayern won 1–0.\n\nThe stadium hosted five games of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including the famous match between Portugal and the Netherlands, consequently known as the Battle of Nuremberg.\n\nOriginally it was known as the Städtisches Stadion () until 1945, when it was renamed Victory Stadium. In 1961, it returned to its original name until 1991, when it received the name Frankenstadion .\n\nOn 14 March 2006, the stadium was renamed easyCredit-Stadion for a period of five years, after a sponsorship deal with the German bank DZ Bank. Many fans of the 1. FC Nuremberg, led by the \"Ultras Nuremberg\" introduced on 1 April 2006, held demonstration against the name and symbolically renamed the stadium with its current name, in honour of one of the best players in the club's history, Max Morlock.

A 300 m² press area, an area for press conferences, and three TV studios make the stadium a truly modern one. 1200 m² makes up the VIP area with room for 800 guests. To compensate for the large number of seats there are 15,000 parking spaces with 205 for VIPs.\n\nThe stadium also has track and field facilities that follow international regulation. A full sprinkler system, that feeds the grass with rain water. The pitch is also heated, and lit with a floodlight system. There are two 60 m² video walls that provide video to the fans. There is also a full power back up system, powered by diesel generators.\n\nBeginning in 1933, the National Socialists began to use the stadium as a marching area for the Hitler Youth. The fourth \"Deutsche Kampfspiele\", one of the biggest events organized by the Nazi Sports Body, took place in this stadium from 23–29 July 1934.\n\nFollowing 1963, the stadium was reconditioned multiple times, so that it could meet the requirements for football in the Bundesliga.\n\nMax-Morlock-Stadion has been renovated two times, once in 1988 to 1991, and then again renovation began again in 2002, to be ready in time for the 2006 World Cup. The 2002 renovation cost €56.2 million; the cost is split between the city of Nürnberg, the State of Bavaria and the building society, which managed the stadium. The stadium has had its capacity increased to 48,548. this modernisation was designed and realized by HPP Architects. This was achieved by extending the southwest and northwest grandstand. The playing field was lowered by 1.30 metres in order to provide all seats an unrestricted view of the field. The Max Morlock place was developed as a place for fans to meet and enjoy something to eat; the total area of this place is 1,000 metres. In the summer of 2012, the capacity was increased to 50,000.\n\nThe Monsters of Rock Tour 1984, originally planned on the Zeppelinfield, took place in the Städtisches Stadion.\n\nP!nk performed at the stadium on July 15, 2010 during the Funhouse Summer Carnival.\n\nThe stadium and the adjacent Nuremberg Arena are well serviced by public transportation to facilitate transport of fans from and to the various sports and musical events taking place there:\n\n\nDuring mass sports and entertainment events, such as Bundesliga games or the annual Rock im Park festival, additional S-Bahn trains running between main station and Frankenstadion station are being put into service. Before the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Frankenstadion station had the length of its existing platform doubled and an additional platform built for that purpose.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The following games were played at the stadium during the tournament:\n\n"}

Martínez (born March 6, 1949 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba) is a former mayor of Hialeah, Florida, United States. He is a Democrat and was mayor for 24 years, first elected in 1981 and was the Democratic congressional candidate for Florida's 21st congressional district in 2008.\n\nMartínez has launched Martínez & Fernández Public Relations in Miami Lakes to provide counsel to a variety of clients in the field of public relations, media relations, government relations, brand management, crisis management and consulting. Martinez and his wife, Ángela Callava, have two children, Aida Martínez-Ruíz and Raul L. Martinez Jr. and three grandchildren, Isabella Sofía Ruíz, Raúl Leonides Martínez III, and Lucas Oliver Martínez.\n\nMartínez is the son of Leonides (Chin) Martínez-Calderín (1925–2007). Chin Martinez was the head of the taxi drivers retirement fund in Cuba during the 1950s, and used his connections to prevent his brother's assassination, Alfredo Martínez Calderín, who then joined Raul Castro in the II Frente Oriental Frank País. Alfredo's son, Rubén Martínez Puente, is presently a general in the Cuban Army.\n\nMartínez arrived in the United States in May 1960 and has been a resident of Hialeah since 1969. He graduated from Miami Senior High School. He received an Associate in Arts Degree from Miami-Dade College (then known as Miami Dade Junior College and later named Miami Dade Community College) and received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice from Florida International University.\n\nMartínez began his public service career in 1971 as a member of Hialeah's Minority Group Housing Committee. In 1976 he was appointed to the Personnel Board and later in 1977 elected to the Hialeah City Council. In 1981, Martínez was elected mayor and re-elected in 1983. In 1985 he became the first Hialeah mayor in 44 years to run unopposed. He was re-elected in 1987 and in 1989 he was elected to a four-year term.\n\nIn 1993, Martínez won re-election by 273 votes, because of a 2 to 1 margin amongst absentee ballots. The election was thrown out by a state judge who ruled that \"overzealous\" and \"unscrupulous\" campaign workers forged so many absentee ballots as to taint the entire vote. Martínez won a special election that was called in 1994. Martinez was again re-elected mayor in 1997 and 2001 where for the second time in his career ran unopposed. He has run and won 9 times as Mayor of Hialeah.\n\nMartínez has received numerous gubernatorial appointments, amongst them the Florida State Commission on Hispanic Affairs from 1979 to 1982, where he was elected Chairman in 1981, and on the Governor's Commission on the Statewide Prosecutor's Function from 1984 to 1985. In 1985, he was appointed by then Governor Bob Graham to the Democratic Policy Commission's Roundtable on Defense and Foreign Policy, as well as to the State Comprehensive Planning Committee.\n\nMartínez is a past-president of the Dade County League of Cities, the Florida League of Cities and served on the Board of Directors of the National League of Cities. He is Chairman of the South Florida Employment and Training Consortium and was the founding vice-chairman of the Beacon Council, a Miami-Dade County development agency composed of public and private sector leaders. The Mayor also served on the High Speed Rail Franchise and Environmental Review Committee.\n\nIn 2004, he was the Parliamentarian to the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston.\n\nOn December 13, 2005, Hialeah City Hall was renamed the \"Raul L. Martinez Government Center\" in recognition to his 24 years as mayor and 4 years as a councilman.\n\nIn 2007, the Republican controlled Florida legislature renamed 49 Street in Hialeah as \"Mayor Raúl L. Martínez Street\".\n\nIn 1989, Martínez was expected to run against State Senator Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Florida's 18th congressional district, left vacant after the death of Claude Pepper. State Senator Ros-Lehtinen's husband, Dexter Lehtinen, the acting US Attorney for South Florida initiated an investigation on alleged accusations of extortion and racketeering. In 1990, he presented his findings to a grand jury that indicted Martinez on eight charges of extortion and racketeering. \n\nThe indictment led to Martínez's suspension from office and trial. In July 1991, Martinez was convicted for six counts of conspiracy, extortion and racketeering and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Martinez appealed the decision and the appellate judges ordered a new trial in 1994, citing\" flawed jury instructions and blatant jury misconduct\". The mayor's second trial ended March 26, 1996 in a hung jury. And the third trial, which began April 22, 1996, resulted in an acquittal on one count of extortion and deadlocked on five remaining counts (by a vote of 11 to 1 in favor of an acquittal).\n\nThe U.S. Attorney at that time, Kendall Coffey, (a Clinton appointee who was confirmed by a Republican U.S. Senate) ultimately dropped the remaining five charges. The Clinton Justice Department then opened a case against Mr. Lehtinen on charges of \"misconduct\" and potential conflicts of interest for investigating \"a potential political rival of his wife.\" Mr. Lehtinen resigned his position as US Attorney.\n\nOn January 21, 2008, Martínez announced on the America TeVe show \"A Mano Limpia\" his intention to run in the November 2008 election for the Florida 21st congressional district seat held by Republican Lincoln Díaz-Balart. Martinez officially announced his candidacy the following day at the Raul L. Martinez Government Center (Hialeah City Hall). Martinez lost to Díaz-Balart, garnering 42% of the vote.\n\nIn June 1999, during a protest of more than 400 people blocking an expressway in Hialeah, the city's then police chief, Rolando Bolanos, was hit in the head with a rock. Bolanos called Martínez to the scene and, during the battle, Martinez punched a butcher, Ernesto Mirabal. Mirabal was charged with battery on an elected official, resisting arrest with violence and inciting a riot. The charges against Mirabel were later dropped. \n\nIn February 2007, when a \"caustic\" press release from Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer criticized Hillary Clinton's presence at a fundraiser at the ex-mayor's home, Martinez responded by using profane language. \n\n\n"}

Noid, known in Japan as , is a 2D action platform game developed by Now Production and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was first released in Japan on March 16, 1990 and was localized in the United States to promote the Noid, the mascot of Domino's Pizza in the late 1980s. The game is also released as part of Nintendo's PlayChoice-10 series and featured in the Japanese TV show GameCenter CX.\n\nIn \"Yo! Noid\", wild creatures led by Mr. Green are running amok around New York City. As they cause havoc, the Mayor of New York decides to call upon the Noid to stop his evil duplicate, save everyone, and give him a massive pizza reward.\n\nBoth games use the modified engine of \"Wagan Land\" and shared the same gameplay. Hanamaru/Noid has no life meter, and loses a life by either making contact with an enemy or running out of time before completing a level. For offense, both characters use different weapons (a Hawk for Hanamaru while a yo-yo for Noid) but they can gather magic points by collecting scrolls and use them for screen-clearing special attacks or very rare power-ups, both kinds of which are found in large scrolls opened with their weapons. Extra lives are awarded for every 20,000 points scored. Most levels are traveled on foot, but some exception in levels varies which includes a skateboard and an autogyro (In Hanamaru, Hanamaru uses his hawk companion for flight). Minigames vary for each version. In Hanamaru, for example, the player whacks penguins in one stage while Yo! Noid uses a \"Pizza Crusher\" level, as seen on the \"Avoid the Noid\" commercials. Boss battles in Hanamaru utilize a card-based system while Yo! Noid focuses on Pizza-eating contests.\n\nExclusive to the Yo! Noid version, the back cover of the instruction manual included a $1 Domino's Pizza coupon.\n\n\"Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru\" was first released in Japan on March 16, 1990. During the game's development on localizing the game, Capcom teamed up with Domino's Pizza to promote the company's mascot, changing a lot of graphics, sound and presentation. However, none of the game mechanics were changed. The localized game was released in the rest of the world as \"Yo! Noid\" in November 1990. In the process, the game gained coherence in locations but lost it in plot and character design. Most of the game's music was re-used for \"Yo! Noid\", though a few tunes were changed. A few new tracks were written for the latter to reflect a more American atmosphere. Before \"Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru\" got released, the Wagan Land engine was used as a base for the game itself. And Namco Bandai Games now published the Wagan Land series while Capcom published both \"Hanamaru\" and \"Yo! Noid\".\n\nOn August 1, 2017, a fan-made sequel titled \"Yo! Noid 2: Enter the Void\" was released digitally as freeware. Originally developed as part of the New Jam City 2017 game jam, the game features elements from fifth-generation console platform games. On July 1st, 2018, a \"Game of a Year Edition\" was released that adds a new \"Remaster Mode\" which removes the '90s-style video filter and makes the game run at 60 frames per second in high definition. It also adds four new unlockable characters, as well as a new pause menu.\n"}
{"id": "2249860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249860", "title": "Sarim", "text": "Sarim\n\nThe Sarim (sometimes Saarim), or \"forest of scholars,\" was a powerful faction of literati that dominated Middle and Late Joseon politics in Korea.\n\nThe philosophical lineage of the Sarim scholars originated from the neo-Confucian school of Gil Jae (1353–1419), a Goryeo scholar who studied under Yi Saek and Jeong Mong-ju. After the fall of the Goryeo dynasty, he retreated to his home village refusing to serve the new Joseon dynasty despite King Taejong's request. Gil Jae concentrated on cultivating a new generation of neo-Confucian scholars including Kim Suk-ja and his son Kim Jong-jik. \n\nWhen King Seongjong became the ninth king of Joseon, he invited Kim Jong-jik and his disciples, who came to be called Sarim scholars, to his court and supported their political growth. They primarily served in so-called Three Offices, from which challenged the entrenched \"Hungu\" officials, who accumulated great power and wealth by supporting King Sejo when he usurped the throne from his nephew.\n\nIn their conflict with the established Hungu faction, Sarim faction suffered a series of bloody purges during the reigns of Yeonsangun, Jungjong, and Myeongjong. They enjoyed a brief period of power during Jungjong's reign through Kim Gueng-pil's disciple Jo Gwang-jo, who pursued radical reforms to transform Joseon into an idealistic neo-Confucian society. \n\nHowever, the Sarim faction, whose origin stems from denial of the legitimacy of Joseon dynasty, was vulnerable to Hungu's attacks because it questioned the legitimacy of King Sejo's usurpation and primarily engaged in the censorate role against the king and ministers. After four major purges that saw Jo Gwang-jo and many others executed, the Sarim scholars again retreated to rural villages where they continued to spread their philosophy through local schools called seowon and maintained their power base through the system of Hyang'yak.\n\nWhile Hungu faction declined over the years without ideological successor to replace it, the Sarim faction maintained its identity through \"martydom\" of the earlier generation and came to dominate the court politics during the reign Seonjo. By then, Sarim philosophy coalesced around the teachings of the philosophers Yi Hwang and Yi I. Since then, the Sarim faction maintained political power for much of the Joseon dynasty.\n\nAfter the Sarim faction replaced the Hungu faction as the predominant political force in the late 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the Eastern faction (\"Dong-in\") and Western faction (\"Seo-in\"). Political divisions intensified even further as the Eastern faction in turn split between the hard-line Northern faction (\"Buk-in\") and the moderate Southern faction (\"Nam-in\") and the Western factions split between the Old Doctrine(\"Noron\") and the Young Doctrine(\"Soron\").\n\nThese factional splits grew out of allegiance to different philosophical schools and regional differences. For instance, the Eastern faction was largely Yeongnam-based, and its subfaction Southerners were mainly followers of Yi Hwang while Northerners coalesced around the school of Jo Shik. Gyeonggi and the Chungcheong-based Western faction were largely followers of Yi I, of which followers of Seong Hon split to form the Soron faction while Song Siyeol's followers became the Noron faction. These divisions were often further driven by questions concerning royal succession or appropriate royal conduct. The factions were often named after relative location of its leader's house.\n\nIn the initial split of Sarim into the Western and Eastern factions, there was a large element of generational conflict. The Westerners were largely older Sarim scholars who entered politics during Myeongjong's reign while the Easterners, led by Kim Hyo-won (김효원) were mainly younger generation who became officials in Seonjo's reign and saw themselves uncorrupted by excesses of Myeongjong's era, which was marred by his maternal uncle Yoon Won-hyeong's corruption.\n\nThe Westerners were led by Shim Eui-gyeom (심의겸), Myeongjong's brother-in-law whose house was on the west of the palace. Although Sarim scholars were usually hostile to royal in-laws as corrupting influence, Shim was Yi Hwang's disciple and protected Sarim scholars by impeaching his uncle who was planning another literati purge. In addition, many Westerners were disciples of Yi I and Seong Hon and followers of Giho school while many Easterners were disciples of Yi Hwang and Jo Shik and followers of Youngnam School. Easterners emphasized moral purification of the ruling class and rooting out corruption of earlier period while Westerners emphasized reforms that would strengthen the country and improve livelihood. (Easterners blamed Shim Eui-gyeom's ill-willed opposition to Kim Hyo-won's appointment at a key position in Ministry of Personnel for split while Westerners blamed Easterner's self-righteous attack.) Yi I attempted to prevent the factional split by appointing Shim Eui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won to provincial posts far away from the court and arranging truce between Easterner Yi Bal and Westerner Jeong Cheol. After Yi I's death, however, the conflict between two factions became more intense as the Easterners impeached Shim Eui-gyeom and Jeong Cheol, leading to their dismissal, and gained upper hand. \n\nIn 1589, Easterner Jeong Yeo-rip was accused of treason because he formed a society with his supporters that met each month to study and receive military training. History of the Sarim after its split is very complicated because there is a wealth of conflicting historical accounts written by each faction. This is especially true with what became known as Gichuk Treason Case of 1589 (기축옥사), the bloodiest purge in Joseon history by far. There is still a dispute about the nature and purpose of Jeong Yeo-rip's group of armed supporters and whether it was treason or frame up. His group was not a secret society as it helped the local government to help fight against the Japanese marauders. On the other hand, it appears that Jeong truly had revolutionary ideas that was close to republicanism. He believed that the world was something to be shared and therefore there could not be one master. His group, called \"Great Common Society\"(대동계), could be joined by anyone regardless of one's social status, and it spread throughout Honam province and to other regions as well. In any case, Jeong Yeo-rip committed suicide after his arrest was ordered, which was considered the admission of guilt, and letters of Easterners were discovered from his house.\n\nJeong Cheol, famous poet and head of the Western faction, was in charge of investigating the case and used the case to effect widespread purge of Easterners who had slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip. According to Easterners' accounts, Jeong Cheol tortured even 80-year-old mother and 8-year-old son of Yi Bal, leader of Eastern faction. According to Westerners' accounts, Jeong Cheol tried heroically to save Yi Bal and Choe Yeong-gyeong from Seonjo's wrath. In any event, 1,000 Easterners were killed or exiled in the aftermath. It is also believed that Seonjo used this incident to weaken the Sarim's power.\n\nThis incident put the Westerners in power, but did not last long because of intrigue involving the appointment of the crown prince, which put the Easterners back in power for thirty years. The Eastern faction soon split into hardline Northern faction (\"Buk-in\"), which wanted to put Jeong Cheol and other Westerners to death, and moderate Southern faction (\"Nam-in\"), which did not want a wholesale purge. The Northerners were largely disciples of Jo Shik and Seo Gyeong-deok and suffered more from Jeong Yeo-rip's \"rebellion\" while the Southerners were largely Yi Hwang's disciples and less affected.\n\nThe Southerners, led by Yu Seong-ryong, were initially in power after Japanese Invasion in 1592, and maintained the policy of coexistence with Northerners and Westerners until its effort to reach peace agreement with Japan failed. The Northerners, now in power, split again over the proper successor to Seonjo, who had no legitimate son. Greater Northern faction supported Gwanghaegun while Lesser Northern faction supported another prince. During Gwanghaegun's reign, Greater Northern faction split further and persecuted other factions until Southerners and Westerners joined their forces in a coup d'état that deposed Gwanghaegun and placed Injo on the throne.\n\nWith the Westerners back in power, Joseon politics entered more stable stage in which they competed with Southerners in relatively peaceful coexistence for about 100 years. But under Hyojong's reign, the Western faction was becoming more powerful.\n\nIn the early years of Sukjong's reign, the Southern faction and Western faction clashed over Royal Funeral Dispute, a seemingly minor issue regarding mourning period for Queen Insun. The Southern faction claimed that mourning period should last one year while Western faction argued for a nine-month mourning period. A one-year mourning period meant that Hyojong was considered the eldest son while 9-month period would suggest that Hyojong was considered not the eldest son, following the rules that governed the yangban class. In other words, Western faction viewed the royal family as the first of yangban class rather than a separate class for which different rules applied. The two factions were also in conflict over issue of fighting Qing Dynasty, which was considered barbarian country (as opposed to Ming Dynasty) that threatened Joseon's national security. Southern faction, led by Huh Jeok and Yoon Hyu, supported war against Qing while Western faction wanted to focus first on improving domestic conditions. Under Sukjong's reign the factional fight became more intense and deadly since Sukjong frequently replaced faction in power with another one to strengthen the royal authority. With each change of government, which was called hwanguk (환국 換局), literally turn of the state, the losing faction was completely driven out of politics with executions and exiles.\n\nSukjong at first sided with the Southern faction, but in 1680, Huh Jeok was accused of treason by Western faction, which led to execution of Huh Jeok and Yoon Hyu and purge of Southern faction. This incident is called Kyungshin hwanguk (경신환국). Now in power, Western faction split into Noron (Old Doctrine) faction, led by Song Siyeol, and Soron (New Doctrine) faction, led by Yoon Jeung. After nine years in power, Noron collapsed when Sukjong deposed Queen Inhyeon, who was supported by Western faction, and named Consort Hee of Jang clan (or Consort Jang) as the new queen. Western faction angered Sukjong when it opposed the naming of Consort Jang's son as crown prince. Southern faction, who supported Consort Jang and her son, regained power and drove out Western faction, executing Song Siyeol in revenge. This is called Gisa hwangguk (기사환국).\n\nFive years later in 1694, Southern faction was planning another purge of Western faction, accusing them of conspiracy to reinstate deposed Queen Inhyeon, when Sukjong began to regret deposing Queen Inhyeon and favor Consort Suk of Choi clan (Consort Choi), an ally of Queen Inhyeon and Noron faction. Angry with Southern faction's attempt to purge Westerners, Sukjong abruptly turned around to purge Southerners and brought the Western faction back in power. The Southern faction would never recover from this blow, also called Gapsul hwanguk (갑술환국). Sukjong demoted Queen Jang to Consort Jang and reinstated Queen Inhyeon. Consort Jang was eventually executed (with poison) for cursing Queen Inhyeon after the latter died. Soron faction supported the crown prince, Consort Jang's son, while Noron faction supported Consort Choi's son, Yeonying-gun (later to become Yeongjo). Late Queen Inhyeon and newly installed Queen Inwon were childless.\n\nIn 1718, Sukjong let the crown prince, soon to be Gyeongjong, rule the country as a regent. He died in 1720 supposedly after telling Yi Yi-myoung to name Yeonying-gun as Kyungjong's heir, but in absence of historiographer or recorder. This will would lead to yet another purge which led to execution of four Noron leaders in 1721, followed by another purge with executions of eight Noron people in 1722.\n\nUnder the reigns of Yeongjo and Jeongjo in the 18th century, the kings pursued a strict policy of equality, favoring no faction over another. However, in Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged as the ruling Noron faction split further between the Byeokpa and Sipa, two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning Yeongjo's murder of his son, who was also Jeongjo's father.\n\nThe division and subsequent conflict of these factions generally revolved around minor issues and reflected dogmatic and rigid nature of their philosophical interpretations. Sarim philosophy, which was progressive in Jo Gwang-jo's time, became very conservative and fundamentalist over time. The power struggle between these factions were marked by bloody purges with each change of power and resulted in a vicious cycle of revenge. The minor issues that divided these factions distracted the officials from real problems that affected the populace. Nevertheless, factional conflicts had some positive side as well. Compared to the late Jungjong and Myeonjong periods, corruption was limited since any faction engaged in excessive corruption would become an easy target for impeachment by its rival faction. Sukjong's reign, which saw some of the most intense factional struggles since Seonjo and Gwanghaegun's time, was one of more prosperous periods for the populace.\n\nIn the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong Kim clan was in control of the government, which led to rampant corruption throughout the country.\n\n\nSarim --> \n\n\n"}

The community is at the mouth of White Rock Creek on the shore of Lake Huron. The community is at , about three miles north of Forestville and about nine miles south of Harbor Beach on M-25 at the junction with White Rock Road.\n\nThe community is named for a large white boulder offshore in Lake Huron at that was used as a boundary marker to define the territory ceded by Ottawa, Chippewa, Wyandot, and Potawatomi with the Treaty of Detroit in 1807. The boundary definition in the treaty began with the \"mouth of the Miami river of the lakes\" or what is now known as the Maumee River at Toledo, Ohio. From there the boundary ran up the middle of the river to the mouth of the Auglaize River at what is now Defiance, Ohio, then due north until it intersected a parallel of latitude at the outlet of Lake Huron into the St. Clair River. This north-south line would become the Michigan Meridian used in surveying of Michigan lands. The intersecting parallel of latitude crossed the meridian at the northeast corner of what is now Sciota Township in Shiawassee County in the middle of the border with Clinton County. From this point the treaty boundary ran northeast to White Rock in Lake Huron, then due east to the international boundary with what was then Upper Canada, and then along the international boundary through the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River and then into Lake Erie to a point due east of the mouth of the Maumee River, and finally west back to the point of beginning.\n\nEdward Petit, the first white settler in Huron County, opened a trading post on nearby Shebeon Creek and later moved the post to White Rock. It is labelled as \"White Rock City\" on some early maps. By the mid-1830s, it was a thriving village and gained its own post office in 1859. The community was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1871 (also known as the Port Huron Fire of 1871, which destroyed huge swaths in several portions of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, but was overshadowed by the Great Chicago Fire and Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin which occurred on the same day). The town soon rebuilt, but never grew beyond a small community.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation began construction of White Rock Roadside Park along M-25 in 2000. Completed in 2003, the small park has a parking lot, outhouses, a historical marker, picnic tables, scenic overlook and public access to the beach of Lake Huron. As of 8/12/2018 the scenic overlook stairs are closed waiting for repairs. It can still be accessed by walking around the initial set of stairs.\n\n"}

Released by Capitol Records on September 27, 2005, it features 111 tracks spread over five compact discs and one DVD. Roughly spanning the group's journey from 1961 to 1977, from their days behind Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan through the departure of Robbie Robertson and the first disbanding of the group. The set includes highlights from each of the group's first seven studio albums and both major live recordings and nearly forty rare or previously unreleased performances.\n\nFor those unwilling or unable to shell out for the full Box Set, Capitol released a single CD+DVD abridged version titled The Best of A Musical History in 2007. It included a selection of what the compilers felt were the best tracks of the five CDs, as well as a shorter version of the DVD.\n\nThe first disc focuses on the period from 1961 through 1968, giving the first legitimate release on compact disc to four of five single sides the group recorded in 1965, the fifth previously released on 1994's \"Across the Great Divide\". Opening with two tracks featuring an early incarnation of the group featuring Danko, Robertson and Helm (with Manuel on one track) backing Ronnie Hawkins, the disc goes into the first recordings of the group without Hawkins, with Helm assuming lead vocal duties. From there come the earliest tracks featuring the classic line-up, mostly 12-bar blues material, including the group's single sides, the earlier sides recorded as The Canadian Squires, the later sides as Levon and the Hawks. Sessions with Bob Dylan (mostly without Helm) and demo recordings close the disc. These recordings constitute one part of a larger set that will be released as \"From Bacon Fat to Judgement Day\", chronicling the group's journey from 1957 to 1967.\n\nDisc two focuses on 1968, featuring all but one track either in its original or in an alternate or extended version from the group's debut album, as well as several outtakes, a few of which are new to the set. A number with Dylan recorded at a Woody Guthrie tribute concert (where the group performed as \"The Crackers\") and a few of the group's tracks from \"The Basement Tapes\" round out the disc.\n\nThe third CD focuses on 1969 to 1971. Eight of twelve tracks from the group's eponymous second album and an early version of a ninth constitute the first part of the disc, with five of ten (with an early version of a sixth) from the third album, a handful of live numbers and a run-through of one track that would appear on the group's fourth album finish the disc.\n\nDisc four focuses on 1971 to 1973, opening with an additional four tracks from the group's fourth album. From there, nine tracks recorded during the shows that made up the group's fifth album, the live \"Rock of Ages\", one of them previously unreleased. The disc closes with three tracks from various sessions in 1972 and 1973, two previously unreleased, and one track from the group's homage to early rock and roll, \"Moondog Matinee\".\n\nThe final audio disc focuses on 1973 to 1976, opening with a further three tracks and an outtake from \"Moondog Matinee\". Three further tracks with Dylan follow, two of which were previously released on \"Planet Waves\" and \"Before the Flood\". Three of eight tracks from the group's seventh album make up the middle of the disc. The group's last studio sessions, some of which was released on their final album for Capitol, as well as one previously unreleased live track follow. The disc closes with a handful of tracks from the live/studio hybrid \"The Last Waltz\", recorded in 1976 and 1977 and released in 1978.\n\nThe sixth disc, a DVD, features various performances between 1970 and 1976. Among these are three of four performances the group did on their 1976 appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\", two performances from Wembley Stadium, one performance from the sessions that produced their \"Rock of Ages\" album, two from the 1970 Festival Express tour and one from a rarely seen promotional video. All tracks are either previously unreleased in full or in total.\n\nAll songs are written by Robbie Robertson, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn.b. a separate release featuring material from the set was issued as a 'Best of ...'\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2249912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249912", "title": "Rio de Janeiro Metro", "text": "Rio de Janeiro Metro\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro Metro (Portuguese: \"MetrôRio\" , commonly referred to as just the Metrô ) is a rapid transit network that serves the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Metrô was inaugurated on March 5, 1979 and consisted of five stations operating on a single line. The system currently covers a total of , serving 41 stations, divided into three lines: Line 1 (); Line 2 (), which together travel over a shared stretch of line that covers 10 stations of an approximate distance of 5 kilometers; and Line 4 (). Metrô Rio has the second highest passenger volume of the metro systems in Brazil, after the São Paulo Metro.\n\nLine 1 (orange line) serves downtown Rio, tourist areas in the South Zone, and several neighbourhoods in the North Zone. It is a semicircular line, and is fully underground. It runs from Uruguai Station to Ipanema/General Osório Station. Line 2 (green line) serves working-class residential neighborhoods extending toward the north. It is a northwest-to-southeast line, and almost completely above-ground (mostly at grade and partly elevated). This line started as a light rail, but due to increasing numbers of commuters, it gradually changed to rapid transit or metro. Because of its origin as light rail, it is at grade except for Estácio Station (the former connection station between lines 1 and 2), which is underground and Cidade Nova Station, which is elevated, and Line 4 (yellow line), connecting Barra da Tijuca/Jardim Oceânico Station in the West Zone to Ipanema/General Osório Station on Line 1.\n\nThe Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro remains responsible for the expansion of the metro network through Rio Trilhos. In late December 2007, the lease was renewed until 2038 and Metrô Rio assumed responsibility for the construction of Cidade Nova Station , which serves as a link between Line 2 and Line 1 ending the need to transfer stations, with the purchase of 114 cars, and construction of Uruguai Station, extending Line 1 further north.\n\nThe extension works of Line 2, called Line 1A, which ended the need for a transfer at Estácio Station and allowed the direct connection from Pavuna Station to Botafogo were started by Metrô Rio on November 13, 2008 and the tracks were completed in December 2009. With the extension, the 250 thousand passengers that circulate daily on Line 2 do not need to change trains any more in order to get to the South Zone. The interconnection of the two metro lines will reduce, by up to 13 minutes, the journey time from Pavuna station to the city's downtown, the destination of 83% of Line 2's passengers.\n\nRio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil and the most popular tourist attraction in the country. After 1950, the number of motor vehicles on the roads increased dramatically. Rio de Janeiro lies in a hilly region, between the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. The landscape of the city is extremely uneven, making travelling by car or bus a very time-consuming task through the narrow streets. These conditions are ideal for trams but not for the increasing traffic of motor vehicles. By the early 1960s, traffic jams, pollution, and smog had become a serious problem in the city. To overcome these problems, local transport authorities decided to reduce the tram network and switch over to a metro network.\n\nOn December 14, 1968, the Companhia do Metropolitano do Rio de Janeiro (Metro Company of Rio de Janeiro in English) was created through State Law number 1736. In March 1975, with Law–Decree number 25, the company effectively came into existence. On June 23, 1970, construction work started in Jardim da Glória. From 1971 to 1974, owing to a lack of resources, construction work stopped and was only resumed a year later. The Rio de Janeiro Metro began operating in March 1979, during the administration of governor Chagas Freitas. In the beginning, there were only five stations: Praça Onze, Central, Presidente Vargas, Cinelândia Station, and Glória Station, operating from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM.\n\nIn its initial 10 days, the system transported more than half a million people, averaging sixty thousand passengers per day. At that time, the subway worked with only four trains of four cars each, with an average interval of eight minutes. In December of the same year, the operating schedule was extended until 11:00 PM, including Saturdays. In 1980, the metro system began to be expanded with the opening of Uruguaiana Station and Estácio stations. The two new stations caused larger passenger demand, compelling an increase in the number of trains from four to six.\n\nThe Carioca station in Downtown Rio de Janeiro, the busiest station with more than eighty thousand passengers a day, was finished in January 1981. By the end of the same year, the stations Catete Station, Morro Azul (now called Flamengo Station), and Botafogo Station were completed. In November 1981, Line 2 (or Linha 2 in Portuguese) started operating with only two stations: São Cristóvão and Maracanã Station (which serves the Maracanã football stadium). In December, completing the southern section of the first Line 1, Largo do Machado Station began service. In 1982, the complementary inaugurations of the northern section of Line 1 started, with the beginning of operations of the Afonso Pena, São Francisco Xavier and Saens Peña stations.\n\nTo allow the completion of the second line to Irajá, in 1983, the trains on this line began operating from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM. After a month, this schedule was extended until 8 PM, and a free bus service was established, integrating the Estácio, São Cristóvão, and Maracanã stations. After the conclusion of the works, the Pre-Metro and Maria da Graça, Del Castilho, Inhaúma Station and Irajá Station stations were opened. In 1984 the commercial operation of the second line began with five trains on workdays with a five-and-a-half-minute interval during the week.\n\nFollowing the expansion, the Triagem station was inaugurated in July 1988, the year of the creation of the subway/train integration ticket. In 1991, the Engenho da Rainha station was inaugurated. From 1991 to 1996, two stations were opened, Thomaz Coelho and Vicente de Carvalho. In this period, the time interval of the nine stations of the second line was reduced to six minutes. In July 1998, Cardeal Arcoverde Station, in the traditional neighbourhood of Copacabana, was inaugurated. Five more stations became operational in the following two months: Irajá Station, Colégio Station, Coelho Neto, Engenheiro Rubens Paiva, Acari/Fazenda Botafogo and Pavuna Station.\n\nIn 1997, the Carnival Operation (Operação de Carnaval in Portuguese) began with continuous service during the Rio Carnival festivity days. In December of that year the system was privatised and the management and operation of the company passed into the hands of the Consortium Opportrans with a concession of 20 years, leaving the responsibility for expansion of the network in the hands of the state government of Rio de Janeiro through the company Rio Trilhos. The Rio Reveillón (New Year's Eve celebrations) is highlighted by the performance of Opportrans that since 1999 has conducted a Special Operation to ensure a party for all. Tickets illustrated scheduled appointments to avoid overcrowding and provide the best service.\n\nIn 2003 Siqueira Campos Station in Copacabana was inaugurated. Cantagalo Station beyond Siqueira Campos was due to be completed in March 2006 but owing to financial problems the opening date was postponed to December 15. This was again postponed and the final opening took place in February 2007. At the same time construction began on the subway extension to General Osório station in Ipanema. This was opened in December 2009.\n\nIn late December 2007, Metro Rio renewed the concession, then defined as for another 20 years, to 2038.\n\nLine 1A from Pavuna to Botafogo opened in December 2009 with a connection between São Cristóvão and Central. Passenger traffic at Estácio is reduced and the elimination of the need to transfer between Lines 1 and 2 saves up to 13 minutes of journey time. A new station on the new section, Cidade Nova, was opened in November 2010; the station is on Avenida Presidente Vargas and serves the City Hall.\n\nIn June 2010, the construction of Line 4 began, linking Ipanema to Barra da Tijuca, where most events of the 2016 Olympic Games occurred.\n\nThe cars are of monoblock construction in stainless steel. Passenger train composition normally use six cars (four on rare occasions), but Line 2 was planned to use eight cars. Older stock driving cars can accommodate a maximum of 351 passengers (40 seated), while non-driving cars accommodate a maximum of 378 passengers (48 seated). Thus, in six-car configurations the maximum number of passengers that can be transported is 2,214.\n\nLine 1 is served by exclusively old types of rolling stock, which are full metro. Since Line 2 was formerly a light rail line, there are some old types of stock that have been converted from light rail to metro stock. New B type stock is full metro stock. This line was initially served by old A type stock, built by La Brugeoise et Nivelles and Cobrasma.\n\nInside each coach, seat arrangement is both parallel and perpendicular to the windows. When the left side has parallel seats, the right side has perpendicular seats, and vice versa. Each vertical seat has a handle for easier standing. There are vertical stanchions from ceiling to floor for standing passengers, one set in front of the horizontal seats, another set at the middle of the coach. Both A and B type trains are air-conditioned.\n\nLines 1, 2 and 4 share EMUs built by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles Co. Ltd. The 6-car trains were designed in 18 months and all 19 sets are currently operating in passenger service. The trains entered revenue service 23 months after contract award.\n\nAll stations are underground. Cinelândia and Central stations have island platforms. Carioca, Saens Peña, Botafogo and General Osório stations have both side and island platforms, although Saens Peña consists of two island platforms and three tracks. The northernmost of the three tracks appears to be disused and planned for use after the Line 1 extension. Saens Peña is a very busy station, with train turnarounds made very quickly. All other stations have side platforms, up and down tracks are divided by a low wall at stations with side platforms. Siqueira Campos, Carioca, Central, Uruguaiana are Cardeal Arcoverde have a large mezzanine floor between surface and underground tracks.\n\nCentral, which is a major interchange point between the Metro, local and longer-distance bus lines, and the SuperVia train network, is the busiest station on the network. The Cardeal Arcoverde station was dynamited out of the base of São João Mountain and retains a cavelike structure. General Osório has some painting in the hallways to remember prehistoric attempts at communication.\n\nUruguai Station opened in March 2014, becoming the new terminal station of Line 1 in the North Side of Rio de Janeiro.\nLine 1A is actually an extension of Line 2 to Botafogo station. Line 2 is elevated from Irajá to Colégio. Many of the stations have island platforms, although Pavuna has both side and island platforms. Underground from Central to Botafogo.\n\nOwing to its origin as light rail, it is fully above-ground (except Estácio station, which is underground). Most stations like Irajá and others, have an island platform, whereas some stations like Triagem have side platforms. Maracanã station is directly linked by an overbridge to the Maracanã Stadium across the street.\n\n\n\nThe Barra Expresso included a single ticket pass and the fare for a bus trip to Barra da Tijuca, a neighborhood located in the West Side of Rio. This integration ended when Line 4 was opened to the public.\n\nThe investment of R$1.15 billion included also the purchase of 19 additional compositions; 114 new cars with a technology that allows the passengers to circulate inside the train. The first of the new compositions was scheduled to arrive in December 2010 and the others to start operating gradually before December 2011. These cars were intended for use on Line 2 and have a dimensioned air conditioning system to bear the sun and heat's direct incidence, as most part of the line is in the surface. With the increase of 63% of the fleet, the concessionaire also planned to standardize the compositions of Lines 1 and 2: all 49 trains will have six cars.\n\nThe control, signalization, ventilation and energy systems will be also expanded and modernized. The energy supply for the metro's operation will be reinforced with two new proper sub-stations, at Uruguaiana and Largo do Machado Stations, and with the remodeling of São Cristóvão and Central sub-stations. On the other hand, the signalization will be automated in the two lines. Metrô Rio will enhance the ventilation at the stations and will modernize all equipment of the Control and Operations Center, from where the complete daily operation is monitored. These actions, combined with the extension of Line 2, will allow Metrô Rio to transport more than 1.1 million passengers/day.\n\nLine 4 (yellow line) was completed on July 30, 2016, connecting Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood in the West Zone, passing under São Conrado and Rocinha, to Ipanema/General Osório Station. All stations are underground, but when arriving in Barra da Tijuca, trains exit a tunnel, pass briefly by an elevated bridge and go underground again.\n\nLine 3 is proposed to connect Rio de Janeiro to Niterói via a 4 km tunnel underneath the Guanabara Bay.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was built between 1929 and 1930 to host the inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums. On July 18, 1983, it was declared by FIFA as the only historical monument of World Football, the only building of its kind worldwide.\n\nEstadio Centenario is the primary home of the Uruguay national team. Uruguay has always been a threat when playing in their home stadium, consistently beating top teams. Even the top ranked Brazil national football team has only managed three wins in 20 opportunities; two were official matches during 2010 and 2018 World Cup qualification, but one was Uruguay's heaviest defeat at the stadium, when they lost 4–0 to Brazil in 2009.\n\nThe construction of the Centenario is one of the most important stages in the development of sports in South America and international football. It was built especially for the organization of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, by immigrant workers in a record time of nine months. Its name originates from the celebration of 100 years of the ratification of the first Constitution of Uruguay.\n\nInitially, all World Cup matches were to be played in the Centenario. However, heavy rains in Montevideo delayed construction of the stadium, so that several matches had to be played in the Pocitos Stadium of Club Atlético Peñarol, and the Parque Central of Club Nacional de Football. It was inaugurated on July 18, 1930, in the match between Uruguay and Peru, with the \"Celeste\" gaining victory 1–0, with a goal by Hector \"Manco\" Castro.\nThe final match of the inaugural World Cup matched Uruguay and Argentina, with Uruguay winning 4–2. Since then, the Centenario has been the scene of Copa América (1942, 1956, 1967, 1995), three South American Youth Championships (1979, 2003, 2015), a South American Under-17 Football Championship (1999) and 1980 Mundialito.\n\nAside from the Uruguay national team, any football club can rent the stadium for its home matches. Peñarol has done that often, and Nacional rents it for some international matches. Peñarol played all of its home matches at the stadium from 1933 until it moved to Estadio Campeón del Siglo in 2016.\n\nIn the case of other Uruguayan teams, they often decide to play there against both Peñarol and Nacional.\n\nThe stadium has four Grandstand separated by four lanes. The main one is the\" Olympic\" Tribune (and lower Platea known as \"Olympic\"), which is named so because the team had won two Olympic championships in a row (1924 and 1928). This has a maximum capacity of 21,648 spectators located in the three rings and the audience. Then there are the \"popular\", so called because they are sold cheaper, these are: the \"Colombes\", in honor of the Colombes, France in which the national team became Olympic champions 1924 and \"Amsterdam\", because it was where the \"Celeste\" were crowned Olympic champions for the second time in 1928.

Only its headquarters is in Delta County, in the city of Delta. It borders the San Juan National Forest to the south.\n\nWithin the national forest boundaries can be found the arid Uncompahgre Plateau and the northern portion of the San Juan Mountains. The forest contains three alpine wilderness areas, Uncompahgre (formerly the Big Blue Wilderness), Mount Sneffels and Lizard Head.\n\nThe Uncompahgre National Forest is managed jointly with the Grand Mesa and Gunnison National Forests headquartered in Delta. There are local ranger district offices located in Montrose, Gunnison, and Norwood.\n\nThe varied climate, sparse population, and abundance of sun make the Uncompahgre National Forest popular with jeepers, atv'ers, sight seers, and hikers. A common recreational activity within the Forest boundaries is scenic driving, thanks in part to the Million Dollar Highway.\n\nThere are several dirt roads within the Uncompahgre; some are mining roads left from the 1800s mineral rush, others are occasionally used by the Forest Service. Paved roads include the San Juan Skyway, Alpine Loop, the Unaweep-Tabeguache Scenic and Historic Byway and Owl Creek Pass, which is gravel.\n\nThere are three officially designated wilderness areas lying within Uncompahgre National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

{"id": "2249945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249945", "title": "Twin tail", "text": "Twin tail\n\nA twin tail is a specific type of vertical stabilizer arrangement found on the empennage of some aircraft. Two vertical stabilizers—often smaller on their own than a single conventional tail would be—are mounted at the outside of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer. This arrangement is also known as an H-tail, as it resembles a capital \"H\" when viewed from rear - these were used on a wide variety of World War II multi-engine designs that saw mass production, especially on the American B-24 Liberator and B-25 Mitchell bombers, the British Avro Lancaster and Handley-Page Halifax heavy bombers, and on the Soviet Union's Petlyakov Pe-2 attack bomber. \n\nA special case of twin tail is twin boom tail or double tail where the aft airframe consists of two separate fuselages, \"tail booms\", which each have a rudder but are usually connected by a single horizontal stabilizer. Examples of this construction are the twin-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning; Northrop P-61 Black Widow; Focke-Wulf Fw 189; the single jet-engined de Havilland Vampire; cargo-carrying Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar and the little known Transavia PL-12 Airtruk.\n\nSeparating the control surfaces allows for additional rudder area or vertical surface without requiring a massive single tail. On multi-engine propeller designs twin fin and rudders operating in the propeller slipstream give greater rudder authority and improved control at low airspeeds, and when taxiing. A twin tail can also simplify hangar requirements, give dorsal gunners enhanced firing area, and in some cases reduce the aircraft's weight. It also affords a degree of redundancy—if one tail is damaged, the other may remain functional.\n\nMost often, the twin vertical surfaces are attached to the ends of the horizontal stabilizer, but a few aircraft in aviation history—like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Mitsubishi G3M and Dornier Do 19 bombers, had their twin vertical surfaces mounted to the upper surface of the fixed stabilizer instead, at some distance \"inwards\" from the horizontal stabilizer's tips.\n\nMany canard aircraft designs incorporate twin tails on the tips of the main wing. Very occasionally, three or more tails are used, as on the Breguet Deux-Ponts, Lockheed Constellation and Boeing 314 Clipper. A very unusual design can be seen on the E-2 Hawkeye, which has two additional vertical tails fixed to the horizontal stabilizer between the normal vertical twin-tail surfaces. This arrangement was chosen for the stringent size limitations of carrier-based aircraft.\n\nSignificant aircraft with twin tails include the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Handley-Page Halifax, Avro Lancaster, and P-38 Lightning. The arrangement is not limited to World War II-vintage aircraft, however. Many fighter aircraft, like the F-14 Tomcat, F-15 Eagle, Sukhoi Su-27, Mig-29, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, make use of twin tail configurations, as do civilian and cargo designs like the Antonov An-14, Antonov An-22, Antonov An-28, Antonov An-38, Antonov An-225, Beechcraft 18, Beriev Be-12, ERCO Ercoupe, Short 330, Burt Rutan’s Long-EZ and SpaceShipOne.\n\n"}

{"id": "2249951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249951", "title": "Deadly Friend", "text": "Deadly Friend\n\nDeadly Friend is a 1986 American science fiction horror film directed by Wes Craven, and starring Matthew Laborteaux, Kristy Swanson, Michael Sharrett, Anne Twomey, Richard Marcus, and Anne Ramsey. Its plot follows a teenage computer prodigy who implants a robot's hardrive into the brain of his teenage neighbor after she is pronounced brain dead; the experiment proves successful, but she swiftly begins a killing spree in their neighborhood. It is based on the 1985 novel \"Friend\" by Diana Henstell, which was adapted for the screen by Bruce Joel Rubin.\n\nOriginally, the film was a sci-fi thriller without any graphic scenes, with a bigger focus on plot and character development and a dark love story centering around the two main characters, which were not typical aspects of Craven's previous films. After Craven's original cut was shown to a test audience by Warner Bros., the audience criticized the lack of graphic, bloody violence and gore that Craven's other films included. Warner Bros. executive vice president Mark Canton and the film's producers then demanded script re-writes and re-shoots, which included filming gorier death scenes and nightmare sequences, similar to the ones from Craven's previous film, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\". Due to studio imposed re-shoots and re-editing, the film was drastically altered in post-production, losing much of the original plot and more scenes between characters, while other scenes, including more grisly deaths and a new ending, were added. This version was criticized by test audiences for containing too much graphic, bloody violence and gore.\n\nIn April 2014, an online petition for the release of the original cut was made.\n\nTeenage science genius Paul Conway (Matthew Laborteaux) and his single mother Jeannie (Anne Twomey) move into their new house in the town of Welling. He soon becomes friends with newspaper delivery boy Tom Toomey (Michael Sharrett). Living next door to Paul is the Samantha Pringle (Kristy Swanson) and her abusive, alcoholic father Harry (Richard Marcus). Paul built a robot named BB (Charles Fleischer), which occasionally displays autonomous behavior, such as being protective of Paul. Paul, Jeannie, and BB meet Paul's professor, Dr. Johanson (Russ Marin), at Polytech, a prestigious university Paul has a scholarship at.\n\nOne day, Tom, Paul and BB stop at the house of reclusive harridan Elvira Parker (Anne Ramsey), who threatens the boys with a shotgun and expresses instant dislike for BB. Walking away, the trio then encounter a motorcycle gang led by bully Carl (Andrew Roperto). When Carl intimidates Paul, BB assaults him. Another day, while playing basketball, BB accidentally tosses the ball onto Elvira's porch. She takes the ball away from them refuses to give it back, with BB's glowing red over her hostile attitude. On Halloween night, Tom decides to pull a prank on Elvira with the help of Paul, Samantha and BB. BB unlocks her gate and Samantha rings her doorbell. When alarms go off, they hide in a shrubbery nearby. When Elvira sees BB standing near her porch, she shoots him with her shotgun, destroying him and devastating Paul.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Paul and Samantha share their first kiss. Samantha returns home late at night, outraging her father, who slaps her and pushes her down the stairs. At the hospital, Paul learns that Samantha is brain-dead and will be on life support for 24 hours before the plug is pulled. As BB's microchip can interface with the human brain, Paul decides to use it to revive Samantha with Tom's help. The boys enter the hospital using a key taken from Tom's father, who works there as a security guard. After Tom deactivates the power from the basement, Paul takes Samantha to his lab. He inserts the microchip into Samantha's brain and takes her back to his house, hiding her in the shed. After he activates the microchip, Samantha \"wakes up\", but her mannerisms are completely mechanical, suggesting BB is in control of her body.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Paul finds Samantha staring at the window, looking at her father, and he deactivates her. The next morning, Paul finds Samantha gone. When Harry finds the cellar door open and goes downstairs, Samantha attacks him, breaks his wrist and snaps his neck. Paul finds Samantha, and Harry's corpse, in the cellar. Horrified, he hides the body, takes Samantha back to his home and locks her in his bedroom. At night, Samantha breaks into Elvira's house and corners her by throwing her to the wall of her living room. As Elvira screams in horror, Samantha kills her by exploding her head with the basketball she stole from Tom.\n\nWhen Tom learns of Samantha's rampage, he gets into a fight with Paul and threatens to call the police. Still being protective of Paul, Samantha jumps out the attic window and attacks Tom, with Paul and Jeannie intervening. Trying to get her under control, Paul slaps Samantha, resulting in her strangling him. Samantha, quickly coming to her senses, then lets him go and runs away. As Paul goes after her, he again encounters Carl, who gets into a fight with him. Samantha goes back for Paul, grabs Carl and kills him by throwing him at an incoming police car. She runs back to Paul's shed, where Paul comforts her and realizes she's regaining some of her humanity. However, the police arrive with their guns aimed at Samantha, who yells out Paul's name in her human voice. She runs towards him, trying to protect him, but Sergeant Volchek (Lee Paul), thinking she's trying to attack him, shoots her. She says Paul's name one more time before dying in his arms.\n\nLater at the morgue, Paul tries to steal Samantha's body once more. Suddenly, Samantha grabs Paul's neck and her face rips apart, revealing a terrifying variant of BB's head. Her skin strips away, revealing half-robotic bones underneath. With a robotic voice, Samantha tells him to come with her. When a horrified Paul screams and refuses to do so, she snaps his neck, killing him.\n\nWes Craven and Bruce Joel Rubin's original intent for the film was for it to be a science fiction thriller with the primary focus being on the dark love story between Paul and Samantha.\n\nKristy Swanson, 16 years old at the time of filming, was cast as Samantha. She admitted that Craven was unsure of her capability to play the role, but ultimately cast her, and was \"always encouraging... always prodding me in subtle ways.\" She elaborated in a 1996 interview: \"I committed myself completely to it. I just went full out with it. I wanted to do the best job I could possibly do. I was having the time of my life. As for the movie itself, some people love it, some people hate it. It is what it is. I really enjoyed making \"Deadly Friend\". At that point in my life, it was spectacular.\"\n\nProfessional mime artist Richmond Shepard taught Swanson all of the robotic movements that her character has in the film. In an interview, Swanson said this about learning to walk in that specific way: \"Getting those moves down was difficult at first. You don't think walking that way is hard until you actually try doing it. But Richmond was a good teacher and I picked up on most of the moves pretty quickly.\"\n\nDuring filming of one of the studio-demanded scenes where Sam has a nightmare where her father attacks her in her room and she stabs him with a glass vase, there were difficulties on set with the special effects. Swanson mentioned, \"The scene was set up so that I would hit a protective device inside his shirt. But during one take, I missed the device and glass actually shattered on his chest. I freaked out because I thought I had really stuck this glass into his chest. Everybody else just laughed.\" In another incident, the great amount of fake blood turned out to be a problem. \"We had been working on that scene a long time. Finally, it was time for blood to spray out, but something leaked and we had blood spraying all over the set and myself. I was so tired that I started yelling, \"More blood!\" and the effects people really pumped it out.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Maxim\" magazine in May of 2000, Swanson said that the fake head of Elvira that was decimated by the basketball was stuffed with actual cow brains that the production crew picked up from a butcher shop. In a 2006 interview for \"The Hills Have Eyes\", Craven mentioned problems that the basketball scene had with the MPAA: \"On \"Deadly Friend\", we had a scene where a nasty old lady gets her head knocked off with a basketball. The actual scene as it was originally cut was fabulous. She was running around the room like a chicken with its head cut off for ten, fifteen seconds. It was bizarre and wonderful and they cut the shit out of it. So I compiled what we called our \"Decapitation Compilation,\" all the films that I knew of that had decapitations in them that had an R, and sent it to them. They immediately sent it back saying they just base it on what they feel in the room at the time. And we had like eight or ten films in there, like \"The Omen\" where the guy gets his head cut off by the sheet of glass, and it didn't matter to them.\"\n\nCraven had a hand in selecting Bruce Joel Rubin to write the screenplay for \"Deadly Friend\". Rubin agreed with Craven that the film should have a gentler tone than his other features. Craven couldn't write the script himself because he was directing episodes of \"The Twilight Zone\" at the time. Craven and producer Robert M. Sherman hired Rubin as the screenwriter because they read his script for \"Jacob's Ladder\", which was unproduced at the time.\n\nFor the scene chronicling the transplant of BB's microchip into Samantha's brain, Craven called on the advice of retired neurosurgeon William H. Faeth, who has a cameo in the film as a coroner in Sam's hospital room. Craven said that he was very helpful on all the anatomical details.\n\nThe robot, BB, cost over $20,000 to build. Craven used a company called Robotics 21. His eyes were constructed from two 1950's camera lenses, a garage remote control unit, and a radio antenna taken from a Corvette. BB could actually lift 7,500 pounds in weight. The voice of BB was provided by Charles Fleischer, who appeared in Wes Craven's previous film \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" as a doctor.\n\nEarlier in production when the film was originally going to be a PG-rated sci-fi thriller, Craven wanted to make something that was similar to John Carpenter's 1984 sci-fi film \"Starman\". Also, according to Swanson in a 1987 interview with Fangoria writer Mark Shapiro, \"Craven suggested that I take a look at the movie \"Starman\" because what he wanted to do with \"Deadly Friend\" was similar in tone to that film.\" John Carpenter directed \"Starman\" because he wanted to get away from his reputation as a director of violent films, just like Wes Craven wanted to make \"Deadly Friend\" with a PG rating in mind so he could prove that he could make a film that wasn't simply \"blood and guts\" horror.\n\nCraven's original version of the film was screened to a test audience mostly consisting of his fan base. The response from them was negative, criticizing the lack of violence and gore seen in Craven's other films. Finding that Craven had a large fanbase within the horror genre, Warner Bros.' marketing team insisted that additional scenes of gore and horror be incorporated into the finished film.\n\nThe executive vice president of Warner Bros. at the time, Mark Canton, had Rubin write six additional gore scenes into his script, each bloodier than the last. Following the negative reactions from test audiences that saw Craven's first cut of the film and wanted a much more grisly product, it was re-edited in post-production and the more graphic deaths and other re-shot scenes were included, making the final film appear tonally jumbled. Furthermore, with the additional gore introduced, the film struggled being granted a rating with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) due to the overt violence. According to Craven, the film was submitted a total of thirteen times before it was passed.\n\nEditor Michael Eliot was brought in by Warner Bros. to re-edit the original cut of \"Deadly Friend\". Eliot went on to do the same for two other Warner Bros. films, \"Out for Justice\" and \"Showdown in Little Tokyo\". While new scenes were added, others such as more scenes between Paul and Samantha that would have made the film more of a love story as originally intended were deleted for length and pacing reasons. Since re-writes, re-shoots, and post production re-editing heavily changed the original story, Craven and Rubin expressed strong anger and heartbreak at the studio and then virtually disowned the film.\n\nCraven was no longer attracted to the story because of Samantha going on a killing spree when she’s revived. He was much more interested in exploring the adults around her, all of whom seem to be monsters in human skin. In his own words: \"The scares don’t come from her, but from the ordinary people, who are actually much more frightening. A father who beats a child is a terrifying figure. That’s the one person you’re afraid of in the movie. The idea is along the lines that adults can be horrible, without being outside what society says is acceptable.\"\n\nSwanson commented that she found herself and the other actors caught up in the studio's attempts to strong-arm Craven into making the film more visceral than what was originally intended. During both production and re-shoots, changes to the script were being made, title changes were being discussed, and there were many discussions about how violent and bloody the final film would be. All of these issues caused problems for the actors. Regarding the title changes, when Craven started the project, it was titled \"Friend\", much like the Diana Henstell novel it was based on. The title was later changed to \"Artificial Intelligence\" and then to \"A.I.\" before the studio and producers finally settled on \"Deadly Friend\".\n\nIn a 1990 interview with Fangoria journalist Daniel Schweiger, screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin said this about the ending and why it stayed in the film: \"That robot coming out of the girl's head belongs solely to Mark Canton, and you don't tell the president of Warner Bros. that his idea stinks!\" Rubin also said how at the time, people were still blaming him for the ending where Samantha turns into a robot, even though Canton was the one who conceived it. He also mentioned that despite the fact that the studio destroyed the love story of the movie that he and Craven enjoyed, he still enjoyed working with Craven, confirming that he wasn't the one who wanted to change the film and that he should not be blamed for what happened to it. Rubin even said that production was one of the happiest experiences he ever had.\n\nIn another interview, Rubin told the story about how the $36,000 that he got paid for writing the script for \"Deadly Friend\" saved him from going nearly broke due to the four months long Writer's Guild strike and also helped him with a bar mitzvah for his son and to buy a house. In the same interview, Rubin said how at first, he didn't want to write the script, but after changing his mind, he called Robert M. Sherman and got the job. He also said how working on the film was one of the most extraordinary experiences of his life: \"It was a horror film with a lot of elements that are not things I wanted on my resume. And it didn't do very good business, but it was total fun. My kids were on the set every night. My five-year-old Ari was totally in love with Kristy Swanson, who was the lead. She later became Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the movie. She was really sweet to him and even took him on a date.\"\n\nThe theatrical trailer of the movie that Warner Bros. made represented it as a straight-up horror film, with not one frame of BB anywhere. The mixture of teenagers and terror as seen in the trailer implied that \"Deadly Friend\" would be like Craven's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\". In an interview with \"Fangoria\", Craven said that the deadline for delivering the first cut of \"Deadly Friend\" with all of the studio-demanded sequences included, and delivering his original script for \"\", which he was writing with Bruce Wagner, was virtually the same, making it very difficult for him to do both things at once.\n\nHoping to score a financial success with the Halloween trade, Warner Bros. released \"Deadly Friend\" in theaters on October 10, 1986 but the film was a Box-office bomb, grossing $8,988,731 in the United States against an $11 million budget.\n\nAllMovie gave the film a generally negative review, writing, \"It's an intriguing combination of elements, but the end result is a schizoid mess\", calling Craven's direction \"awkward\" and opining that it \"lacks the intense, sustained atmosphere of his previous horror hits.\" The film currently has a 9% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.94/10.\n\nAlthough a critical and commercial failure upon its original release, \"Deadly Friend\" has come to be regarded as a cult classic and has garnered a fan following.\n\nAccording to the book \"Wes Craven: The Art of Horror\" by John Kenneth Muir, Craven's original cut of the film was \"a teenage film filled with charm, wit, and solid performances by likeable teens Swanson and Laborteaux. It was definitely a mainstream, PG film all the way, similar in tone to \"Real Genius\" or \"Short Circuit\", but the point was made that Craven could direct something other than double-barreled horror.\"\n\nThe original cut of the movie did not include the gory dream sequences, the infamous basketball decapitation sequence, the opening jump scare scene at the beginning of the film where the thief tries to steal from Jeannie's minivan but BB stops him by grabbing his throat, and the ending where Samantha turns into a robot and kills Paul. All of these scenes were added because of script re-write demands and re-shoots forced by Warner Bros. executives, former Warner Bros. executive vice president Mark Canton, and the producers.\n\nIn the original cut of the film, Sam smashes Elvira through her front door leaving the upper half of her body hanging outside the door and the lower half still inside. In Bruce Joel Rubin's original script drafts, Elvira is electrocuted by Sam. In the scene where Elvira's body is carried out on a gurney, it's still visible that her door has a big hole which was made in her original death scene. Dialogue said by a neighbor character where he says that her head is all over the walls in her house is heard off-screen, meaning that it was most likely added later when the scene was changed. Parts of the original death scene can be seen in the theatrical trailer. Promotional stills, lobby cards, and other pictures show more deleted scenes, all of which show more of the character and plot-centric parts removed from the final cut for reasons such as pacing and story changes following re-shoots and re-editing. An article by Joseph Maddrey, \"Deadly Friend: An Autopsy\", goes into more detail regarding the troubled production of the film.\n\nThe back cover of Warner Bros.' Twisted Terror DVD release shows a still of a ghostly-looking Samantha wearing a white dress. This is one of a few stills revealing the original ending, where after Samantha gets shot by the police, Paul dreams she's in his room saying goodbye to him. Other stills of this ending have been confirmed to exist but they're very rare, although one can be seen on a fansite dedicated to actress Kristy Swanson.\n\nDue to all of the gore scenes that were added into the film and also because of Craven's bad history with the MPAA, they gave the film an X rating. It had to be cut and submitted thirteen times in order to get an R rating. Most of the cuts were made to the death scenes of Harry and Elvira. A supposedly uncut version was released on DVD by Warner Bros. on September 25, 2007 as part of the Twisted Terror Collection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2249957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249957", "title": "Twisted Nerve", "text": "Twisted Nerve\n\nTwisted Nerve is a 1968 psychological thriller film directed by Roy Boulting and starring Hywel Bennett, Hayley Mills, Billie Whitelaw and Frank Finlay. The film follows a disturbed young man, Martin, who pretends, under the name of Georgie, to be intellectually impaired in order to be near Susan—a girl with whom he has become infatuated. Martin kills those who get in his way.\n\nThe film opens with Martin playing catch with his older brother Pete, who has severe learning difficulties and has been sent to live in a special boarding school in London, by their mother. Martin is the only remaining figure in Pete's family life; their father died years ago and their mother has a new life with her new husband, a wealthy banker. Martin expresses concern for his brother's well-being to the school's physician, who is comfortable with Pete's situation, though he makes it clear that Pete cannot be expected to live much longer.\n\nAfter the title sequence, Martin is shown in a toy store, gazing at Susan, who purchases a toy. As she leaves, Martin follows after having pocketed a toy duck. Two store detectives ask them to return to the manager's office. The detectives assert that Martin and Susan were working together to allow Martin to steal a toy. Susan assures them she has never met Martin.\n\nWhen questioned by the manager, Martin presents himself as mentally challenged, and calls himself \"Georgie\". Apparently now disbelieving in a link between them, the manager asks Susan for her address, and Martin appears to make a mental note when she offers it. Sympathetic to him, Susan pays for the toy. Implying that this was a misunderstanding, the manager lets them leave.\n\nMartin returns home and finds his parents arguing in the parlor, over his lack of interest in life. Despite the apparent course of events in the toy shop, they have come to hear of the duck. There is allusion to some perverse behaviour he has exhibited, though this is not elaborated upon. In his room, now behaving as \"Georgie\", he rocks in a rocking chair while smiling meekly in the mirror and caressing a stuffed animal. The camera pans down to reveal that the rocking motion of the chair is smashing a photo of his stepfather.\n\nThe next day, Martin goes to Susan's house and waits for her to return. She arrives with a young Indian man named Shashee. He drops off Susan, who thanks him; she goes to the library, where she keeps an after-school job. Martin approaches Susan who immediately recognises him as \"Georgie\". He tells her that he followed her, and pays her back for the toy. Before he leaves, Martin, as Georgie, gets Susan to lend him a book about animals.\n\nMartin has a heated conversation with his stepfather, who insists he travel to Australia. Martin refuses and returns to his room. Martin stares in the mirror, bare-chested, and caresses himself. He removes the rest of his clothes as the camera reveals a stack of male bodybuilding magazines on his dresser. He then smashes the mirror in apparent frustration or anger.\n\nMartin sets in motion a plan to leave home, pretend to go to France and then go on to live with Susan. Martin leaves his family and shows up late at Susan's mother's house, where she rents rooms. Presenting himself as Georgie, he gains sympathy both from Susan and her mother and they let him stay.\n\nThe plot unravels with Martin's duplicitous nature clashing against his desires to win Susan's heart. He wants her to accept him as a lover, but cannot reveal that he is in fact Martin, as he is worried she will shun him. Meanwhile, Martin uses his new-found identity to his advantage to seek out revenge on his stepfather, who believes he is in France. This series of decisions leads Martin down the path of self-destruction.\n\nOne night, Martin sneaks out of Susan's house after stealing a pair of scissors, and stabs his stepfather to death in the garage of his home after his stepfather comes home from a dinner party. The police investigate the next day and focus their attention to finding Martin for questioning.\n\nA few days later, Martin invites himself to tag along with Susan who is going for a swim at a country lake where Martin attempts to kiss her until she refuses his advances, making her uncomfortable and suspicious about him. At home a little later, Susan searches Martin's room while cleaning it, and discovers several books hidden in Martin's drawer that a person with learning difficulties would not read or understand, as well as a book titled \"Know Yourself from Your Handwriting\", in which signatures in the blank pages read 'Martin Durnley'.\n\nAt this point, Susan begins investigating Martin, first by talking with his mother, and realizes that Martin and Georgie are one and the same after seeing a photograph of Martin at the house. Next, Susan visits Shashee at a hospital where he works as a resident to question him about split personalities, and suspects that Martin may be not mentally challenged but a narcissistic sociopath.\n\nAt Susan's house, Martin begins losing mental control over himself as he rightly suspects that Susan may know who he really is. When Susan's neglected and unsuspecting mother attempts to sexually arouse Martin, he kills her by hacking her apart with a hatchet in the backyard wood shed (off-camera).\n\nWhen Susan arrives home, Martin holds her captive in his room after finally revealing his true persona. He forces Susan to undress so he can sexually fondle her, while Susan's mother's body is found in the woodshed by Gerry Henderson, one of the \"paying guests\", who calls the police just at the time that Shashee learns the truth about Martin and also calls the police from the hospital and races to the house to rescue Susan.\n\nThe police arrive at Susan's house where they finally subdue and arrest Martin just when he appears that he is going to kill her. They burst into Susan's room as three shots are heard, but Martin had fired at his reflection in the mirror. As Martin is taken away he claims that he is Georgie and had killed Martin. Susan is unharmed but badly shaken. The final shot shows Martin, now confined in a cell at a local mental hospital, ranting over his lost love Susan.\n\n\nIn October 1967 John Boulting announced he would be making a film with Hayley Mills and Hywell Bennett who had just done \"The Family Way\" with the Boultings. They said a title had not been given to the film.\n\nThe film was produced by George W. George and Frank Granat, who had just made \"Pretty Polly\" with Hayley Mills. Filming began on 2 January 1968.\n\nThe film was a co production between British Lion and a new American company, National General.\n\nThe title comes from the poem \"Slaves\" by George Sylvester Viereck (1884–1962) which is quoted twice in the movie, once during Professor Fuller's lecture on chromosome damage, and then as an audio flashback when Martin/Georgie is in a cell:\n\nViereck's motives for his writing have been the subject of some discussion, and have further implications given the debate on eugenics during the middle of the 20th century, a subject somewhat alluded to in Professor Fuller's lecture in the film.\n\nThe film score was composed by Bernard Herrmann and features an eerie whistling tune.\n\nThe theme can also be heard in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" when a menacing Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) impersonates a nurse in the hospital scene and in \"Death Proof\" as Rosario Dawson's character's ringtone, in several episodes of \"American Horror Story\", in the Malayalam movie \"Chaappa Kurish\" as a ringtone of Fahad Fazil's character's iPhone, and in the Bengali movie \"Chotushkone\" where it is also used as a ringtone for Parambrata Chatterjee's character's phone. More recently, it has also been used in Honda's 2015 car advertisement.\n\nStylotone Records reissued the score as part of a deluxe LP set, with a release date of 5 May 2016.\n\nThe theme was also sampled in the Rob $tone song, \"Chill Bill\".\n\nThe film is notorious for its use of Down syndrome, then referred to as mongolism, as a catalyst for Martin's actions. Letters of complaint were sent to the British censor before the film's release, including one from the National Association for Mental Health. The film's medical adviser, Professor Lionel Penrose, asked for his name to be removed from the film. Roy Boulting said these complaints caused him \"shock and surprise and a deep sense of regret and depression\". This led to the filmmakers adding a voiceover just prior to the credits which said:\nIn view of the controversy already aroused, the producers of this film wish to re-emphasise what is already stated in the film, that there is no established scientific connection between monogolism and psychiatric or criminal behaviour.\nEven after this had been added David Ennals, Minister for the State of Health, said \"I do not wish to criticise the film as a film. But I feel it is extremely unfortunate that despite the spoken disclaimer which procedes it, this film can give the impression that there is such a link.\"\n\nAs \"The New York Times\" put it, \"this is a delicate area indeed\", going on to describe the film as \"more unsettling than rewarding, and certainly more contrived than compassionate\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" called the film \"gross, clumsy and ridiculously predictable.\" The \"Observer\" called it \" a glossy commercial psycho thriller which if it weren't for its pernicious implications would be perfectly horrifying\" arguing the film would have been better had the character of the elder brother never existed. \"\"Twisted Nerve\" is a fairly good blood chiller in its genre so long as it is clearly understood that it is a pack of lies.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"thoroughly engrossing, spine tingling.\"\n\n"}

He had a younger brother and two younger sisters. He graduated from Keisung Middle School (today Keisung High School) in Daegu in 1935. He lived in Tokyo from April 1937 until late 1939, during which period he devoted his time to writing. From September 1939 to September 1940, he had several of his poems published in the magazine . Afterwards, due to increasing wartime censorship by the Japanese colonial government, he continued writing privately but did not publish any further poetry until after the liberation of Korea. He was married to Yu Ik-sun (), with whom he had four sons and a daughter.\n\nPark taught at various schools including Keisung Middle School and Ewha Girls' High School beginning in 1946, before joining the faculty of Hongik University as an assistant professor in 1953. In 1961 he took up a position as associate professor at Hanyang University (at which a statue was erected in his honor), and in 1963 he became a full professor there. He was later named the dean of the university's College of Humanities. In 1966 he was elected to the (Yesurwon). He was a board member of the Society of Korean Poets from its founding in 1957, and was chosen as the society's chairman in 1968. He died on March 24, 1978 at his home in Wonhyoro-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul.\n\nPark Mok-wol began his career as a member of \"Cheongrok-pa\" (the Blue Deer school), a group of three poets who also included Cho Chi-hun and Pak Tu-jin, all named after the 1946 anthology in which they appeared. Although they differed in style, their work largely had its basis in natural description and human aspiration. The body of Park Mok-wol's work at this time established a new trend in Korean poetry, one that attempted to express childlike innocence and wonder at life through folk songs and dialectal poetic language.\n\nAmong such poems, \"The Wayfarer\" (나그네) is notable and was set by the musician Isang Yun as the last in his early song book \"Dalmuri\" (A halo, 1950).\nAfter his experiences during the Korean War, Park’s work shifted in style. Now he strove to incorporate the pain, death, and even monotony of daily existence into his poetry without maintaining a standard of sentimental and lyrical quality. His poetry collections, \"Wild Peach Blossoms\" (Sandohwa) and \"Orchids and other poems\" (Nan. Gita) encapsulate his artistic aim to depict the shifting human response to both the joys and sorrows of life. His later poems, however, represent a return to the use of vivid colloquial language as the medium through which to express the color and vitality of local culture.\n\nHis collection of poems from this later stylistic phase, \"Fallen Leaves in Gyeongsang-do\" (Gyeongsang-doui garangnip) provides the artistic forum through which he is able to further explore his earlier questions of the relationship between light and dark, happiness and despair, and life and death. Park’s poetry, especially his later work, reveals a fervent love for life that does not wane despite his diligent acknowledgment of the ever-present threat of the end. He is celebrated for the cautious optimism of his work and his ability to subtly internalize conflicts of empiric reality in his deceptively localized and dialectal poetry.\n\nPark's awards include the Freedom Literature Awards, May Literature and Art Awards, the Seoul City Culture Awards (1969), and the Moran Medal of the Order of Civil Merit (1972). In 2007, he was listed by the Korean Poets' Association among the ten most important modern Korean poets.\n\nPark lived in a house in Wonhyoro-dong from 1965 until his death in 1978. The Seoul Municipal Government had expressed interest in preserving the house as a cultural heritage asset, but his son had to sell it to a real estate developer to cover debts in 2002, and the developer demolished the building in 2004. The demolition, along with similar incidents or near-misses involving the old houses of other cultural figures such as Choe Nam-seon and Seo Jeong-ju around the same time, sparked increasing public interest in the issue of cultural heritage preservation.\n\nAdapted from:\n\n\n"}

It reopened in 2019.\n\nThe red-haired Sheldon \"Red\" Chaney (May 20, 1916 – June 2, 1997) arrived in Springfield after World War II with a bride and a new college business degree. He purchased a small Sinclair gas station with several wooden, motor court cabins tucked among trees on the back of the property. Eventually, a café was added in 1947. Growing weary of pumping gas and operating the motor court, the couple decided a better money-maker would be a restaurant. Since they owned a small herd of beef cattle (and would continue to raise their own beef until the close of the business), they decided to concentrate on hamburgers. The restaurant became a staple of Route 66 and the Springfield area until its closure in 1984. Even after the closure the restaurant remained the same as Red and Julia lived right next door. Red died in 1997 a few days after the restaurant was demolished and Julia died in the early 2000s. For a while all that sat on the spot of the old burger stand was a 24 hour ice machine which is now gone.\n\nIn 2013, a fundraising campaign was established to recreate the Red's Giant Hamburg sign. It will become a focal point in a larger Springfield, Missouri, project to establish a Route 66-themed roadside park. The site is located within the city limits in a section of town called the West Meadows area (on College Street east of Fort Avenue). The sign was installed in 2015.\n\nIn Early 2019, the \"Springfield Business Journal\" announced that Red's Giant Hamburg would be making a comeback 35 years after the original restaurant's closure. The new restaurant, located on Sunshine Street/Route 413, will be a recreation of the original Route 66 (Chestnut Expressway) location after it was razed in 1997 after it was closed for 13 years. The project is being led by David Campbell, the owner of local BBQ chain Buckingham's and insurance agent Greg Iott. The restaurant opened in August 2019.\n\nSpringfield rock and roll band The Morells filmed their tribute song \"Red's\" at the restaurant location in 1982. It was produced by Kevin Hudnell (see links below), and is the subject of \"Red's\", a song by The Morells on their 1982 album, \"Shake and Push\". \"Where the only thing French on the menu is fries.\" In the song it states the words Hamburger. Cheeseburger. Lettuce and tomato. Brown beans. Root beer. French fried potato. It is a crazy little place on the W side of town. A 5 5 Buick knee deep in the ground.\n\n\n"}

Until recently, it was known as the Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment.\n\nFormation reconnaissance regiments, as the name would indicate, are intended to provide Armoured Reconnaissance for a higher-level formation, usually a division or a heavy brigade. In a large-scale defensive operation, they would delay attacking forces, whilst screening heavier units as they moved to engage the enemy. The regiments are, currently, equipped with vehicles of the CVR(T) family or Jackal or RWMIK Land Rover.\n\nFive regular army regiments were equipped for the formation reconnaissance role:\n\nThe Queen's Own Yeomanry was the sole Territorial unit equipped for this role.\n\nUnder Army 2020, this number was reduced to three regiments:\n\nThe Light Dragoons and Queen's Dragoon Guards were re-roled into the 'light cavalry' role along with the Queen's Own Yeomanry\n\nA regiment is organised into three reconnaissance squadrons, each with three reconnaissance troops of four Scimitars and a guided weapons troop of four Strikers. The squadrons also have a support troop with four Spartan APCs, a Mechanical Engineer section with a Spartan and a Samson recovery vehicle and a Squadron Headquarters troop with two Land Rover 110 medium utility trucks, two Sultan command vehicles and a Samaritan ambulance. The main combat strength is thus 12 Strikers and 36 Scimitars.\n\n\nIn addition to these three squadrons, a regiment also contains a Regimental Headquarters squadron, with six Sultans, a Spartan, a Samaritan and two medium utility trucks, and a Light Aid Detachment of the REME with a Sultan, a Samson, a Spartan and a Foden recovery vehicle.\n\nIn wartime, a regiment would be increased to four reconnaissance squadrons by the activation of reserve personnel and Territorial Army Yeomanry units. One of the formation reconnaissance regiments, the Household Cavalry Regiment, has a permanent fourth squadron; this is on detachment with 16 Air Assault Brigade.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, there were four \"Type A\" armoured reconnaissance regiments as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), known as Divisional Reconnaissance Regiments. Each had three Sabre Squadrons; two Medium Reconnaissance Squadrons comprising four troops of 4 x Scorpions together with a Surveillance Troop of 5 x Spartan equipped with ZB298 radar, plus a Close Reconnaissance squadron of five troops of 8 x Scimitars (one for each battlegroup in the division). There were a further four \"Type B\" regiments based in the United Kingdom, earmarked for the reinforcement of BAOR; these had two medium reconnaissance squadrons, of Scimitars and Scorpions, and a close reconnaissance squadron equipped with Fox armoured cars. Finally, four Yeomanry regiments of the Territorial Army were intended for home defence; these had four reconnaissance squadrons of Foxes, with a small number of Ferret armoured cars.\n\nBy 1986, two regular regiments were permanently stationed in Germany, and titled as Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (Tracked) (BAOR); these had four medium reconnaissance squadrons with Scimitars, each also having an integral guided-weapons troop of Strikers. Each of these would operate with one of BAORs armoured divisions. The third armoured division had its reconnaissance regiment based in England, equipped as a Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (Tracked) (UK); this formation had three medium reconnaissance squadrons of Scimitars and Scorpions, and a fourth guided-weapons squadron of Strikers. A fourth regiment was also equipped to this standard, and based in the UK to support NATO mobile forces. There was a third organisation for regular forces, the Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (UK), which had two tracked reconnaissance squadrons of Scorpions and one wheeled reconnaissance squadron of Foxes. In the Territorial Army, there were two organisations, two Yeomanry Reconnaissance Regiment (BAOR) and three Yeomanry Reconnaissance Regiment (UK). The former were equipped with three or four reconnaissance squadrons of Foxes, and intended for reinforcing units based in West Germany; the latter had three or four reconnaissance squadrons of unarmoured civilian Land Rovers, and were intended solely for home defence.\n\nThe 1993 Options for Change review cut the number of regular armoured reconnaissance regiments to two, with a third being created in 1995 by converting the Royal Armoured Corps training regiment. At this point, the regiments were quoted as a combat strength of 48 Scimitars and 12 Strikers; this is comparable to the current regimental structure, but for a four-squadron regiment.\n\nA fourth was created in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review by converting a conventional armoured regiment to the reconnaissance role. The 1998 conversion, however, saw the regiments reduced to three squadrons rather than four, with a single Yeomanry regiment for peacetime reinforcement, with the effect that the total number of operational squadrons remained the same.\n\nThe force was increased to five regiments by the 2003 Defence White Paper, again by re-roling an armoured regiment; it is about this time that the designation Formation Reconnaissance Regiment appeared.\n"}

{"id": "2249996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249996", "title": "Nechtan mac Der-Ilei", "text": "Nechtan mac Der-Ilei\n\nNechtan mac Der-Ilei or Nechtan mac Dargarto (Old Irish \"Nechtan mac Der-Ilei\" or \"Nechtan mac Dargarto\") (before 686-732) was king of the Picts 706-724 and 728-729. He succeeded his brother Bridei in 706. He is associated with significant religious reforms in Pictland. He abdicated in 724 in favour of his nephew and became a monk. In 728 and 729 he fought in a four-sided war for the Pictish throne.\n\nIt has been argued that Nechtan son of Derile should be identified with the Nechtan son of Dargart mentioned in the Annals of Ulster in 710. Dargart is taken to be the Dargart mac Finguine who died in 686, a member of the Cenél Comgaill kindred of Dál Riata. On this basis, and because Bede mentions that the Picts allowed for matrilineal succession in exceptional cases, it is thought that Der-Ilei was Nechtan's mother. \n\nOther brothers and half-brothers of Nechtan and Bridei would include Ciniod or Cináed, killed in 713, Talorgan son of Drest, a half-brother or foster-brother, held captive by Nechtan in the same year, and perhaps Congas son of Dar Gart who died in 712. A number of later figures, including the Talorgan son of Drest, king of Atholl, executed by drowning in 739, and the Talorgan son of Congus, defeated in 731 and likewise drowned in 734, and his unnamed brother, may be associated with Nechtan's family.\n\nBede claimed that relations between the Picts and Northumbria were peaceful in his time. However, the Annals of Ulster for 711 report a Pictish defeat at Northumbrian hands, \"in Mag Manonn\", presumably in the area around Stirling where the kingdom of Manau had once been, where Finnguine son of Deile Roith was killed. Nothing more is known of Finnguine, but as he bore Nechtan's paternal grandfather's name, it may be that he was a kinsman of the Pictish king.\n\nBede's \"Ecclesiastical History\" includes a letter from Abbot Ceolfrid of the twin monasteries of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow to Nechtan on the subject of the dating of Easter, sent around 710. Ceolfrid assumes his correspondent is an educated man, going some way to justifying Thomas Owen Clancy's description of Nechtan as a philosopher king. Nechtan was convinced by Ceolfrid, and the expulsion of clergy associated with Iona in 717 may be related to the controversy over Easter and the manner of tonsures; however, it is equally likely to have been entirely unrelated. Often portrayed as a struggle between the so-called Celtic Church and Rome, it is evident that the majority of Irish clerics had long accepted the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter.\n\nAs well as providing Nechtan with guidance on the Easter controversy, Ceolfrid sent masons and craftsmen to aid in building stone churches. Bede's claim that Nechtan dedicated his kingdom to Saint Peter has led to Nechtan being linked to the Peterkirks at Rosemarkie, Duffus, Restenneth and elsewhere in north-east Scotland.\n\nTwo sons of Nechtan are thought to have died in 710, and it is not known whether he had any surviving sons or daughters. The Annals of Tigernach note, in 724, that Nechtan entered a monastery, leaving the throne to Drest. Although the identification must be uncertain, it is assumed that this Drest is the son of Nechtan's half-brother.\n\nKing Drest may not have had a secure hold on power. One Simul son of Drest, perhaps yet another sibling of Nechtan, was imprisoned by Drest in 725. In the same year, Brec of Fortriu died. He is assumed from the context to be the bishop of Fortriu, almost certainly appointed by Nechtan and the earliest known bishop in Pictland. In 726, Drest had Nechtan imprisoned. This may have involved no more than removing the former king from one monastery, where he had friends and influence, to another where Drest's partisans were in control.\n\nIn 728, Óengus son of Fergus defeated the shadowy Alpín. It seems likely that at this time, if not earlier, Nechtan had left the monastic life and was warring with Drest and Alpín. After Alpín was defeated a second time, the Annals of Tigernach say that Nechtan was restored to the kingship. A battle between Óengus's army and Nechtan's enemies at Monith Carno (perhaps Cairn O' Mounth, near Fettercairn) ended with the defeat of Nechtan's enemies, among whom are named Biceot son of Moneit, Finguine son of Drostan and Feroth son of Finguine.\n\nAfter being restored to power, Nechtan reigned until 732. He was succeeded by Óengus.\n\nIt has been suggested that the St Andrews Sarcophagus was commissioned by Óengus to hold Nechtan's remains, although it is more generally supposed that the sarcophagus was for Óengus himself. Nechtan's attachment to Saint Peter may have led later chroniclers, writing in a period when Saint Andrew was of far greater importance, to have emphasised ninth-century kings who had supported the cult of Saint Andrew.\n\nA number of later traditions associating earlier Pictish kings named Nechtan with the monastic foundation at Abernethy may have confused them with this Nechtan. \n\nNechtan's ecclesiastical reforms are seen as having led to closer links between Pictland and Northumbria, with notable results in artistic forms. His expulsion of Ionan clerics, rather than being a submission to Rome and Northumbria, probably marks the coming of age of an independent Pictish church, which nonetheless remained close to Iona and to Ireland. In addition, it speaks to a very considerable degree of royal control over the church in Pictland, which appears to have been contentious in the ninth century.\n\n"}

Jackson Wilderness in Washington, United States. Kyes Peak rises to over . Together with Columbia Peak and Monte Cristo Peak it forms a basin that contains Columbia Glacier and Blanca Lake. It is the highest summit in the Monte Cristo group of peaks.\n\nKyes Peak was once mapped as Goblin Peak, and in earlier times was known by miners and the United States Forest Service as Mount Michigan. The name Kyes comes from a member of the first climbing party, James Ellsworth Kyes. Along with Reginald Bachelder, Kyes climbed the mountain on August 15, 1920. Both were members of the Everett Boy Scouts at the time.\n\nIt is uncommon for a Washington Cascades mountain to be named after a person who climbed it. The USGS agreed to posthumously rename the mountain in recognition for Kyes' sacrifice commanding a destroyer in the Battle of the Atlantic. An earlier ascent of the peak was probably made by Thomas Gerdine of the USGS in 1897.\n\nKyes Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.\n\nThe North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.\n\nThe history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \"U\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.\n\n\n"}

The regional capital is the municipality of Singida. The region is bordered to the north by Shinyanga Region, Simiyu Region and Arusha Region, to the northeast by Manyara Region, to the east by Dodoma Region, to the southeast by Iringa Region, to the southwest by Mbeya Region and to the west by Tabora Region.\n\nThe region has seven districts, Singida Rural, Singida Urban, Manyoni District, Ikungi District, Itigi District, and Mkalama District.\n\nSingida Region is accessible from Arusha through Babati and Katesh in Manyara Region. From Dar es salaam, Singida Region is reached through Morogoro and Dodoma. From Mwanza, the region is reached through Shinyanga and Nzega. All these roads are passable all year round with good quality tarmac.\n\nSingida region is located below the equator between latitudes 3052’ and 7034’. Longitudinally the region is situated between 33027’ and 350 26’ east of Greenwich. To the north, it shares borders with Shinyanga Region; Arusha, Manyara and on the east borders Dodoma. To the south it shares borders with Iringa and Mbeya while on the west there is Tabora Region.\n\nSingida region has a total surface area of 49,438 km, out of which 95.5 km or 0.19 percent are covered by water bodies of Lake Eyasi, Kitangiri, Singidani, Kindai and Balengida. The remaining 49,342.5 km is land area. Singida region is deemed to be neither small nor big. It is the 13th in size and occupies about 5.6 percent of mainland Tanzania's total area of 881,289 km.\n\nIn regard to climate there are two key features which are temperature and rainfall. The region forms part of the semi-arid central zone of Tanzania, which experiences low rainfall and short rainy seasons which are often erratic, with fairly widespread drought in one year out of four. Total rainfall ranges from 500 mm to 800 mm per annum, with high geographical, seasonal and annual variation. There are two rather well defined seasons, the short rainy season during the months of December to March or sometimes goes to April and the long dry season from April to November.\n\nThe wetter areas in Singida region are along the escarpment near Kiomboi in Iramba district and in the south-west of Manyoni district near Rungwa, where the long-term mean annual rainfall exceeds 800 mm. The mean annual rainfall is in the range of 600 mm to 800 mm over large areas of Iramba and Singida districts. On the eastern side of Manyoni district near the Bahi Swamp and the Rift Valley depression of Mgori and Shelui divisions lies the drier area in the region where the mean annual rainfall is less than 550 mm. The regional mean annual average rainfall is 700 mm.\n\nThe temperatures in the region vary according to altitude but generally range from about 15 °C in July to 30 °C during the month of October. Moreover, temperature differences are observed between day and night and may be very high, with hot afternoons going up to 35 °C and chilly nights going down to 10 °C.\n\nWinds follow a monsoonal pattern being north-easterly during the months of November to March and south-easterly for the rest of the year (dry season). In May to October, the winds are usually dry and contribute to the semi-aridity of the region. The fact that maximum wind velocities coincide with the period of greatest water deficiency underlines the climatic impact of these winds on moisture losses and hence desertification.\n\nThe economy of Singida is based heavily on agriculture. Most of the population, including children, work extensively on the farms during the rainy season which is between December and March. The region is mostly rural with 95% of the population being land production. Agriculture makes the region 60% of the total income. Besides Agriculture, other main productive sectors include, livestock, natural resources, mining industry and trade.\n\nThe main food crops in Singida region include maize, millet, sorghum, paddy, cassava and sweet potatoes. These crops are cultivated during the rainy season. Some of the cash crops include sunflower, cotton, tobacco, wheat, beans, groundnuts, peas, and onions. The grazing area in Singida makes up 40% of the region however, 80% of the area is infected with Tse-tse fly, leaving only 20% grazeable. Overgrazing is caused by small amount of land grazeable in the region which decreases livestock productivity.\n\nSingida has a large number of livestock with around 1.4 million cattle, 0.7 million goats, 0.4 million sheep, 42,00 donkeys and 1.1 million chickens. Livestock ranks 2nd as major resource for the economy. This includes, livelihood, and beef export which is a major trade domestically and nationally. Other contributions for the economy are mining, commence, and natural resources consisting of agro-forestry, wildlife, bee keeping and fishing. The region has a minimal contribution of Industrial production and commercial activity. However, research has shown potential growth in business and small scale industries with local skill from people. Singida has a progressive increase to the GDP income for the country of Tanzania. It contributes 3% to the government of Tanzania's GDP.\n\nThe socio-economic status in Singida is decently well. In most cases, Singida positively exceeds national standards as far as infant mortality, health unit ratio to population, and maternal mortality rate. The region has an underdeveloped primary and secondary education. There are only 351 primary and secondary schools within the population.\n\nEmployment in Singida is generally undertaken upon the people themselves. The youth and middle age group are considered the most economically active. Most occupations are dominated by men. Women predominantly work in the field with farming. The majority of employed people are in the rural area of the region.\n\nSingida region is home to over one million residents. There are a number of different inhabitants that occupy this region. One ethnic group of this region is known as the Turu people, it is the most prominent ethnic group in the region as they currently have a world population of over 1,000,000 members with most of them residing in the Singida region. This group mainly practices Christianity and also a form of animism as worship of the sun plays into their lives being heavily dependent on agriculture. The Turu also rely heavily on grain production for the purposes of acquiring cattle, which is a very important commodity to the Turu. They primarily produce crops like uwele, maize and matama and The Turu rely on wives in the community to harvest crops and they are huge component of the Turu economy, as such bride wealth via cattle is often arranged in order to obtain a bride. Nyamwezi people are a tribe who's ancestral home are in certain parts of Singida. This tribe survives off of cereal agriculture producing primarily crops like sorghum, millet, and rice. The Nyamwezi have matrilineal descent groups. Ancestral worship is also integral to the Nyamwezi and they also look to high gods and spirits for guidance. The Isanzu people are based in the Iramba district of Singida region. The Isanzu speak a Bantu language called Kinyihanzu and the population is approximately 87,000 people. The Isanzu are also farmers who survive off of sorghum, millet, and maize. Some Isanzu are also migrant laborers in other parts of the country; and they also have matrilineal descent. The Datooga people also live in certain parts of the Singida region and as of 1996 there are approximately 100,000 Datooga people. They mainly practice Christianity but have strong adherence to traditional practices rooted in animist beliefs. This entails relying on rainmaking, and sorcery, and strong respect and deference for ancestors who are looked to for spiritual guidance. The Datooga primarily speak the language Datooga and are a formerly nomadic people, now many rely on agriculture and farm crops like maize, beans and millet. This group also practice polygamy and rank wives based on order of marriage.\n\nThe main political party representing the Tanzanian government is CCM (Chama Cha Mapinduzi), which the presidents have five year terms and can be reelected once. Singida Region is run by a town council led by a regional commissioner, Hon. Rehema Nchimbi. The currently Member of the Parliament representing Singida is Hon.

The town is also home to immigrants from different parts of Tanzania. Iramba district belongs to Nyiramba tribe while Ikungi district belongs to Nyaturu. Manyoni district belongs to Gogo and a few of Nyaturu tribes.\n\nThe photo below features one of the Chief Saidi Gwau's wife Bibi Nyamwagele of Samumba. Gwau was chief of Singida South around the 1940s, after he died his brother Chief Mange Gwau took over the crown until after Tanzania's independence, when chief leadership was abolished. The Gwau family is well known in Singida for the Nyaturu tribe development. Bibi Nyamwagele died in 2004.\nSingida has a railway station on a branch off the Central Railway of Tanzanian Railways, although it is currently not working. It is a branch terminal. The railway from Singida joins the Central line at Manyoni.\n\nMost roads in Singida Region are made of tarmacs, with good quality. As of 2012 a new asphalt road was completed between Singida and Dodoma. An asphalt road was also built between Singida and Mwanza.\nAlso roads within the district are of good condition, some of them made of tarmacs and other seasonal roads.\n\nSingida Airstrip is a public airstrip located west of the town .\n\n\n"}

A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts. The technique is also applicable in generic programming.\n\nIn a unit test, mock objects can simulate the behavior of complex, real objects and are therefore useful when a real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into a unit test. If an object has any of the following characteristics, it may be useful to use a mock object in its place:\n\n\nFor example, an alarm clock program which causes a bell to ring at a certain time might get the current time from a time service. To test this, the test must wait until the alarm time to know whether it has rung the bell correctly. If a mock time service is used in place of the real time service, it can be programmed to provide the bell-ringing time (or any other time) regardless of the real time, so that the alarm clock program can be tested in isolation.\n\nMock objects have the same interface as the real objects they mimic, allowing a client object to remain unaware of whether it is using a real object or a mock object. Many available mock object frameworks allow the programmer to specify which, and in what order, methods will be invoked on a mock object and what parameters will be passed to them, as well as what values will be returned. Thus, the behavior of a complex object such as a network socket can be mimicked by a mock object, allowing the programmer to discover whether the object being tested responds appropriately to the wide variety of states such mock objects may be in.\n\nClassification between mocks, fakes, and stubs is highly inconsistent across the literature. Consistent among the literature, though, is that they all represent a production object in a testing environment by exposing the same interface.\n\nWhich out of \"mock\", \"fake\", or \"stub\" is the simplest is inconsistent, but the simplest always returns pre-arranged responses (as in a method stub). On the other side of the spectrum, the most complex object will fully simulate a production object with complete logic, exceptions, etc. Whether or not any of the mock, fake, or stub trio fits such a definition is, again, inconsistent across the literature.\n\nFor example, a mock, fake, or stub method implementation between the two ends of the complexity spectrum might contain assertions to examine the context of each call. For example, a mock object might assert the order in which its methods are called, or assert consistency of data across method calls.\n\nIn the book \"The Art of Unit Testing\" mocks are described as a fake object that helps decide whether a test failed or passed by verifying whether an interaction with an object occurred. Everything else is defined as a stub. In that book, \"fakes\" are anything that is not real, which, based on their usage, can be either \"stubs\" or \"mocks\".\n\nConsider an example where an authorization subsystem has been mocked. The mock object implements an codice_1 method to match that in the real authorization class. Many advantages follow if it also exposes an codice_2 property, which is not present in the real class. This allows test code easily to set the expectation that a user will, or will not, be granted permission in the next call and therefore readily to test the behavior of the rest of the system in either case.\n\nSimilarly, mock-only settings could ensure that subsequent calls to the sub-system will cause it to throw an exception, hang without responding, or return codice_3 etc. Thus it is possible to develop and test client behaviors for realistic fault conditions in back-end sub-systems as well as for their expected responses. Without such a simple and flexible mock system, testing each of these situations may be too laborious for them to be given proper consideration.\n\nA mock database object's codice_4 method may not contain much (if any) implementation code. It might check the existence and perhaps the validity of the Person object passed in for saving (see fake vs. mock discussion above), but beyond that there might be no other implementation.\n\nThis is a missed opportunity. The mock method could add an entry to a public log string. The entry need be no more than \"Person saved\", or it may include some details from the person object instance, such as a name or ID. If the test code also checks the final contents of the log string after various series of operations involving the mock database then it is possible to verify that in each case exactly the expected number of database saves have been performed. This can find otherwise invisible performance-sapping bugs, for example, where a developer, nervous of losing data, has coded repeated calls to codice_5 where just one would have sufficed.\n\nProgrammers working with the test-driven development (TDD) method make use of mock objects when writing software. Mock objects meet the interface requirements of, and stand in for, more complex real ones; thus they allow programmers to write and unit-test functionality in one area without calling complex underlying or collaborating classes. Using mock objects allows developers to focus their tests on the behavior of the system under test without worrying about its dependencies. For example, testing a complex algorithm based on multiple objects being in particular states can be clearly expressed using mock objects in place of real objects.\n\nApart from complexity issues and the benefits gained from this separation of concerns, there are practical speed issues involved. Developing a realistic piece of software using TDD may easily involve several hundred unit tests. If many of these induce communication with databases, web services and other out-of-process or networked systems, then the suite of unit tests will quickly become too slow to be run regularly. This in turn leads to bad habits and a reluctance by the developer to maintain the basic tenets of TDD.\n\nWhen mock objects are replaced by real ones, the end-to-end functionality will need further testing. These will be integration tests rather than unit tests.\n\nThe use of mock objects can closely couple the unit tests to the implementation of the code that is being tested. For example, many mock object frameworks allow the developer to check the order of and number of times that mock object methods were invoked by the real object being tested; subsequent refactoring of the code that is being tested could therefore cause the test to fail even though all mocked object methods still obey the contract of the previous implementation. This illustrates that unit tests should test a method's external behavior rather than its internal implementation. Over-use of mock objects as part of a suite of unit tests can result in a dramatic increase in the amount of maintenance that needs to be performed on the tests themselves during system evolution as refactoring takes place. The improper maintenance of such tests during evolution could allow bugs to be missed that would otherwise be caught by unit tests that use instances of real classes. Conversely, simply mocking one method might require far less configuration than setting up an entire real class and therefore reduce maintenance needs.\n\nMock objects have to accurately model the behavior of the object they are mocking, which can be difficult to achieve if the object being mocked comes from another developer or project or if it has not even been written yet. If the behavior is not modelled correctly then the unit tests may register a pass even though a failure would occur at run time under the same conditions that the unit test is exercising, thus rendering the unit test inaccurate.\n\n\n"}

The project consisted of a press conference unveiling of Ultraman Noa, the airing of the new Ultra Series \"Ultraman Nexus\", and this movie featuring Ultraman Next. Ultraman Next resembled a lifelike insectoid version of Nexus (with insect-like body armor and organic tissue-like skin underneath).

Rum is then added to the anise and honey mixture. Because of the rum content, the xtabentún liqueur is sometimes called a \"distilled honey\" beverage, which is misleading, because the honey alcohol is fermented, not distilled. It is, nonetheless, a spirit beverage, since rum, a distilled product, is added. Distilleries still survive today in the Yucatán that produce the liqueur.\n\nXtabentún may have its origin in \"balché\", a ceremonial liquor produced by the Maya. The strong flavor did not appeal to the Spanish \"conquistadores\", so they introduced anise and took away the tree bark and corn.\n\nThe word \"xtabentún\" means \"vines growing on stone\" in the Mayan language. It refers to the Christmas vine (\"Turbina corymbosa\"), a species of morning glory whose seeds contain ergine and have hallucinogenic properties. This has led Jonathan Ott to suggest that \"balché\" may also have had entheogenic qualities, although this remains to be demonstrated. Ancient Mayas likely would have enjoyed the inebriating effects of a similar beverage to produce visionary and trance states.\n\nIt is usually served straight, cold, or with ice and honey.

{"id": "2250081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250081", "title": "Vital signs", "text": "Vital signs\n\nVital signs (also known as vitals) are a group of the four to six most important medical signs that indicate the status of the body’s vital (life-sustaining) functions. These measurements are taken to help assess the general physical health of a person, give clues to possible diseases, and show progress toward recovery. The normal ranges for a person’s vital signs vary with age, weight, gender, and overall health.\n\nThere are four primary vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, pulse (heart rate), and breathing rate (respiratory rate), often notated as BT, BP, HR, and RR. However, depending on the clinical setting, the vital signs may include other measurements called the \"fifth vital sign\" or \"sixth vital sign\". Vital signs are recorded using the LOINC internationally accepted standard coding system.\n\nEarly warning scores have been proposed that combine the individual values of vital signs into a single score. This was done in recognition that deteriorating vital signs often precede cardiac arrest and/or admission to the intensive care unit. Used appropriately, a rapid response team can assess and treat a deteriorating patient and prevent adverse outcomes.\n\nThere are four primary vital signs which are standard in most medical settings:\n\n\nThe equipment needed is a thermometer, a sphygmomanometer, and a watch. Although a pulse can be taken by hand, a stethoscope may be required for a patient with a very weak pulse.\n\nTemperature recording gives an indication of core body temperature which is normally tightly controlled (thermoregulation) as it affects the rate of chemical reactions. Body temperature is maintained through a balance of the heat produced by the body and the heat lost from the body.\n\nTemperature can be recorded in order to establish a baseline for the individual's normal body temperature for the site and measuring conditions. \n\nTemperature can be measured from the mouth, rectum, axilla (armpit), ear, or skin. Oral, rectal, and axillary temperature can be measured with either a glass or electronic thermometer. Note that rectal temperature measures approximately 0.5°C higher than oral temperature, and axillary temperature approximately 0.5°C less than oral temperature. Aural and skin temperature measurements require special devices designed to measure temperature from these locations. \n\nWhile 37°C (98.6°F) is considered \"normal\" body temperature, there is some variance between individuals. Most have a normal body temperature set point that falls within the range of 36.0°C to 37.5°C (96.5–99.5°F).\n\nThe main reason for checking body temperature is to solicit any signs of systemic infection or inflammation in the presence of a fever. Fever is considered temperature of 37.8°C or above. Other causes of elevated temperature include hyperthermia, which results from unregulated heat generation or abnormalities in the body's heat exchange mechanisms.\nTemperature depression (hypothermia) also needs to be evaluated. Hypothermia is classified as temperature below 35°C (95°F) . \n\nIt is also recommended to review the trend of the patient's temperature over time. A fever of 38 °C does not necessarily indicate an ominous sign if the patient's previous temperature has been higher.\n\nThe pulse is the rate at which the heart beats while pumping blood through the arteries, recorded as beats per minute (bpm). It may also be called \"heart rate\". In addition to providing the heart rate, the pulse should also be evaluated for strength and obvious rhythm abnormalities. The pulse is commonly taken at the wrist (radial artery). Alternative sites include the elbow (brachial artery), the neck (carotid artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), or in the foot (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries). The pulse is taken with the index finger and middle finger by pushing with firm yet gentle pressure at the locations described above, and counting the beats felt per 60 seconds (or per 30 seconds and multiplying by two). The pulse rate can also be measured by listening directly to the heartbeat using a stethoscope. The pulse may vary due to exercise, fitness level, disease, emotions, and medications. The pulse also varies with age. A newborn can have a heart rate of 100-160 bpm, an infant (0-5 months old) a heart rate of 90–150 bpm, and a toddler (6-12 months old) a heart rate of 80–140 bpm. A child aged 1-3 years old can have a heart rate of 80-130 bpm, a child aged 3-5 years old a heart rate of 80-120 bpm, an older child (age of 6-10) a heart rate of 70-110 bpm, and an adolescent (age 11-14) a heart rate of 60–105 bpm. An adult (age 15+) can have a heart rate of 60–100 bpm.\n\nAverage respiratory rates vary between ages, but the normal reference range for people age 18 to 65 is 16–20 breaths per minute. The value of respiratory rate as an indicator of potential respiratory dysfunction has been investigated but findings suggest it is of limited value. Respiratory rate is a clear indicator of acidotic states, as the main function of respiration is removal of CO leaving bicarbonate base in circulation.\n\nBlood pressure is recorded as two readings: a higher systolic pressure, which occurs during the maximal contraction of the heart, and the lower diastolic or resting pressure. In adults, a normal blood pressure is 120/80, with 120 being the systolic and 80 being the diastolic reading. Usually, the blood pressure is read from the left arm unless there is some damage to the arm. The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure is called the pulse pressure. The measurement of these pressures is now usually done with an aneroid or electronic sphygmomanometer. The classic measurement device is a mercury sphygmomanometer, using a column of mercury measured off in millimeters. In the United States and UK, the common form is millimeters of mercury, while elsewhere SI units of pressure are used. There is no natural 'normal' value for blood pressure, but rather a range of values that on increasing are associated with increased risks. The guideline acceptable reading also takes into account other co-factors for disease. Therefore, elevated blood pressure (hypertension) is variously defined when the systolic number is persistently over 140–160 mmHg. Low blood pressure is hypotension. Blood pressures are also taken at other portions of the extremities. These pressures are called segmental blood pressures and are used to evaluate blockage or arterial occlusion in a limb (see Ankle brachial pressure index).\n\nIn the U.S., in addition to the above four, many providers are required or encouraged by government technology-in-medicine laws to record the patient's height, weight, and body mass index. In contrast to the traditional vital signs, these measurements are not useful for assessing acute changes in state because of the rate at which they change; however, they are useful for assessing the impact of prolonged illness or chronic health problems.\n\nThe definition of vital signs may also vary with the setting of the assessment. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs), in particular, are taught to measure the vital signs of respiration, pulse, skin, pupils, and blood pressure as \"the 5 vital signs\" in a non-hospital setting.\n\nThe \"fifth vital sign\" may refer to a few different parameters.\n\n\nThere is no standard \"sixth vital sign\"; its use is more informal and discipline-dependent.\n\n\nChildren and infants have respiratory and heart rates that are faster than those of adults as shown in the following table:\nMonitoring of vital parameters most commonly includes at least blood pressure and heart rate, and preferably also pulse oximetry and respiratory rate. Multimodal monitors that simultaneously measure and display the relevant vital parameters are commonly integrated into the bedside monitors in intensive care units, and the anesthetic machines in operating rooms. These allow for continuous monitoring of a patient, with medical staff being continuously informed of the changes in general condition of a patient.\n\nWhile monitoring has traditionally been done by nurses and doctors, a number of companies are developing devices which can be used by consumers themselves. These include Cherish Health, Scanadu and Azoi.\n\n"}
{"id": "2250084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250084", "title": "Matthew Murray", "text": "Matthew Murray\n\nMatthew Murray (1765 – 20 February 1826) was an English steam engine and machine tool manufacturer, who designed and built the first commercially viable steam locomotive, the twin cylinder \"Salamanca\" in 1812. He was an innovative designer in many fields, including steam engines, machine tools and machinery for the textile industry.\n\nLittle is known about Matthew Murray's early years. He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1765. He left school at fourteen and was apprenticed to be either a blacksmith or a whitesmith. In 1785, when he concluded his apprenticeship, he married Mary Thompson (1764–1836) of Whickham, County Durham. The following year he moved to Stockton and began work as a journeyman mechanic at the flax mill of John Kendrew in Darlington, where the mechanical spinning of flax had been invented.\n\nMurray and his wife, Mary, had three daughters and a son, also called Matthew.\n\nIn 1789, due to a lack of trade in the Darlington flax mills, Murray and his family moved to Leeds to work for John Marshall, who was to become a prominent flax manufacturer. John Marshall had rented a small mill at Adel, for the purpose of manufacture but also to develop a pre-existing flax-spinning machine, with the aid of Matthew Murray. After some trial and error, to overcome the problem of breakages in the flax twine during the spinning of the flax, sufficient improvements were made to enable John Marshall to undertake the construction of a new mill at Holbeck in 1791, Murray was in charge of the installation. The installation included new flax-spinning machines of his own design, which Murray patented in 1790. In 1793 Murray took out a second patent on a design for \"Instruments and Machines for Spinning Fibrous Materials\". His patent included a carding engine and a spinning machine that introduced the new technique of \"wet spinning\" flax, which revolutionised the flax trade.\nMurray maintained the machinery for Marshall's mills and made improvements that pleased his employer. At this stage it seems that Murray was the chief engineer in the mill.\n\nIndustry in the Leeds area was developing fast and it became apparent that there was an opportunity for a firm of general engineers and millwrights to set up. Therefore, in 1795, Murray went into partnership with David Wood (1761–1820) and set up a factory at Mill Green, Holbeck. There were several mills in the vicinity and the new firm supplied machinery to them. The firm was so successful that in 1797 it moved to larger premises at Water Lane, Holbeck. The firm welcomed two new partners at this point; James Fenton (previously Marshall's partner) and William Lister (a millwright of Bramley, Leeds). The firm became known as Fenton, Murray and Wood. Murray was the technical innovator and in charge of obtaining orders; Wood was in charge of day-to-day running of the works; Fenton was the accountant.\n\nAlthough the firm still served the textile industry, Murray began to consider how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which was attached to the gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.\n\nIn 1799 William Murdoch, who worked for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of steam valve, called the D slide valve. This, in effect, slid backwards and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other. Matthew Murray improved the working of these valves by driving them with an eccentric gear attached to the rotating shaft of the engine.\n\nMurray also patented an automatic damper that controlled the furnace draft depending on the boiler pressure, and he designed a mechanical hopper that automatically fed fuel to the firebox. Murray was the first to adopt the placing of the piston in a horizontal position in the steam engine. He expected very high standards of workmanship from his employees, and the result was that Fenton, Murray and Wood produced machinery of a very high precision. He designed a special planing machine for planing the faces of the slide valves. Apparently this machine was kept in a locked room, to which only certain employees were allowed access.\n\nThe Murray Hypocycloidal Engine in Thinktank museum, Birmingham, England, is the third-oldest working engine in the world, and the oldest working engine with a hypocycloidal gear.\n\nAs a result of the high quality of his steam engines, sales increased a great deal and it became apparent that a new engine assembly shop was required. Murray designed this himself, and produced a huge three-storeyed circular building known as the Round Foundry. This contained a centrally mounted steam engine to power all of the machines in the building. Murray also built a house for himself adjoining the works. The design of this was pioneering, as each room was heated by steam pipes, so that it became known locally as Steam Hall.\n\nThe success that Fenton, Murray and Wood enjoyed because of the high quality of their workmanship attracted the hostility of competitors, Boulton and Watt. The latter firm sent employees William Murdoch and Abraham Storey to visit Murray, ostensibly on a courtesy visit, but in reality to spy on his production methods. Murray, rather foolishly, welcomed them, and showed them everything. On their return they informed their employers that Murray's casting work and forging work were much superior to their own, and efforts were made to adopt many of Murray's production methods. There was also an attempt by the firm of Boulton and Watt to obtain information from an employee of Fenton, Murray and Wood by bribery. Finally, James Watt jnr purchased land adjacent to the workshop in an attempt to prevent the firm from expanding.\n\nBoulton and Watt successfully challenged two of Murray's patents. Murray's patent of 1801, for improved air pumps and other innovations, and of 1802, for a self-contained compact engine with a new type of slide valve, were contested and overturned. In both cases, Murray had made the mistake of including too many improvements together in the same patent. This meant that if any one improvement were found to have infringed a copyright, the whole patent would be invalidated.\n\nDespite the manoeuvrings of Boulton and Watt, the firm of Fenton, Murray and Wood became serious rivals to them, attracting many orders.\n\nIn 1812 the firm supplied John Blenkinsop, manager of Brandling's Middleton Colliery, near Leeds, with the first twin-cylinder steam locomotive (\"Salamanca\"). This was the first commercially successful steam locomotive.\n\nThe double cylinder was Murray's invention, he paid Richard Trevithick a royalty for the use of his patented high pressure steam system, but improved upon it, using two cylinders rather than one to give a smoother drive.\n\nBecause only a lightweight locomotive could work on cast iron rails without breaking them, the total load they were capable of hauling was very much limited.\nIn 1811, John Blenkinsop patented a toothed wheel and rack rail system. The toothed wheel was driven by connecting rods, and meshed with a toothed rail at one side of the track. This was the first rack railway, and had a gauge of 4 ft 1½ ins.\n\nOnce a system had been devised for making malleable iron rails, around 1819, the rack and pinion motion became unnecessary, apart from later use on mountain railways. However, until that time it enabled a small and lightweight locomotive to haul loads totalling at least 20 times its own weight. \"Salamanca\" was so successful that Murray made three more models. One of these was known as \"Lord Wellington\", and the others are said to have been named \"Prince Regent\" and \"Marquis Wellington\", though there is no known contemporary mention of those two names. The third locomotive intended for Middleton was sent, at Blenkinsop's request, to the Kenton and Coxlodge Colliery waggonway near Newcastle upon Tyne, where it appears to have been known as \"Willington\". There it was seen by George Stephenson, who modelled his own locomotive \"Blücher\" on it, minus the rack drive, and therefore much less effective.\n\nAfter two of the locomotives exploded, killing their drivers, and the remaining two were increasingly unreliable after at least 20 years hard labour, the Middleton colliery eventually reverted to horse haulage in 1835. Rumour has it that one remaining locomotive was preserved for some years at the colliery, but was eventually scrapped.\n\nIn 1811 the firm made a Trevithick-pattern high-pressure steam engine for John Wright, a Quaker of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The engine was fitted to the paddle steamer \"l'Actif\", running out of Yarmouth. The ship was a captured privateer that had been purchased from the government. Paddle wheels were fitted to it and driven by the new engine. The ship was renamed \"Experiment\" and the engine was very successful, eventually being transferred to another boat, \"The Courier\".\n\nIn 1816 Francis B. Ogden, the United States Consul in Liverpool received two large twin-cylinder marine steam engines from Murray's firm. Ogden then patented the design as his own in America. It was widely copied there and used to propel the Mississippi paddle steamers.\n\nMurray made important improvements to the machinery for heckling and spinning flax. Heckling was the preparation of flax for spinning by splitting and straightening the flax fibres. Murray's heckling machine gained him the gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1809. At the time when these inventions were made the flax trade was on the point of expiring, the spinners being unable to produce yarn to a profit. The effect of his inventions was to reduce the cost of production, and improve the quality of the manufacture, thus establishing the British linen trade on a solid foundation. The production of flax-machinery became an important branch of manufacture at Leeds, large quantities being made for use at home as well as for exportation, giving employment to an increasing number of highly skilled mechanics.\n\nIn 1814 Murray patented a hydraulic press for baling cloth, in which the upper and lower tables approached each other simultaneously. He improved upon the hydraulic presses invented by Joseph Bramah, and in 1825 designed a huge press for testing chain cables. His press, built for the Navy Board, was 34 ft long and could exert a force of 1,000 tons. The press was completed just before Murray's death.\n\nMatthew Murray died on 20 February 1826, at the age of sixty. He was buried in St. Matthew's Churchyard, Holbeck. His tomb was surmounted by a cast iron obelisk made at the Round Foundry. His firm survived until 1843. Several prominent engineers were trained there, including Benjamin Hick, Charles Todd, David Joy and Richard Peacock.\n\nIt is a testament to the good design and workmanship that went into his steam engines, that several of his big mill engines ran for over eighty years, and one of them, installed second-hand at the locomotive repair works at King's Cross, ran for over a century.\n\nMurray's only son Matthew (c.1793–1835) served an apprenticeship at the Round Foundry and went to Russia; he founded an engineering business in Moscow, where he died age 42.\n\n\n"}

His movies include \"Mr. Skeffington\" (1944), \"Nora Prentiss\" (1947), and \"The Young Philadelphians\" (1959).\n\nHe began his career as an actor on Broadway and later in film. He directed B-movies for Warner Bros. and then moved to directing to A-pictures. He was a good friend of actor Errol Flynn, whom he directed in \"Adventures of Don Juan\" (1949). He directed three Joan Crawford movies: \"The Damned Don't Cry\" (1950), \"Harriet Craig\" (1950), and \"Goodbye, My Fancy\" (1951).\n\nSherman was born Abraham Orovitz to Jewish parents. He was born and raised in the small town of Vienna, Georgia, where his father was a dry-goods salesman. Not long after graduating from Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, he became a professional actor.\n\nSherman arrived in New York City to sell a play and soon became a stage director and actor. As a stage actor, he made his debut in May 1936 in \"Bitter Stream\" which included Frances Bavier, later known for her role on \"The Andy Griffith Show\". He arrived in Hollywood during the early sound era, where he appeared in William Wyler's 1933 film \"Counsellor at Law\" starring John Barrymore. In 1938, Sherman signed on at Warner Bros. as a director. His first film as a director was the 1939 horror film \"The Return of Doctor X\", which starred Humphrey Bogart. The 2006 release of \"The Return of Doctor X\" included a director's commentary that Sherman had recorded that year at the age of 99.\n\nSherman quickly built a reputation for his ability to rewrite any script he was given and turn it into the basis for a successful film. It was these skills that led him to much bigger and star-studded pictures. Sherman was initially known as a \"woman's director\" during the mid 1940s, but his range expanded as his career developed.\n\nAfter his film career wound up, Sherman ended his career in television. In 2004, he was the oldest of 21 individuals interviewed in the documentary film \"Imaginary Witness\", a work that chronicled 60 years of film-making about the Holocaust.\n\nSherman was married to Hedda Comorau from 1931 until her death in 1984. He had two children with Comorau: a son Eric Sherman and a daughter Hedwin Naimark. He had a number of high-profile affairs during his life, including on-set affairs with Bette Davis and a three-year relationship with Joan Crawford. In his memoir \"Studio Affairs: My Life as a Film Director\", he described his relationship with Crawford and Rita Hayworth. During the last nine years of his life, he was in a romantic relationship with Francine York.\n\nSherman died on June 18, 2006, a month short of his 100th birthday, at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.\n\n"}

The head of the main branch of the glacier originates at the saddle between Mount Witherspoon and Mount Einstein.\n\nThe Alaska Marine Highway vessel M/V \"Columbia\" is named after the Columbia Glacier.\n\nThe glacier twists its way through western Alaska's Chugach Mountains. The bald streak at the bottom of the mountains, called the trimline, shows this glacier has lost of thickness. It has also retreated since that measurement was taken.\n\nThe glacier's speed of retreat at the terminus reached a maximum of nearly per day in 2001, when it was discharging icebergs at approximately per year; the glacier has subsequently slowed down, resulting in an increase in retreat rate.

It was released on August 24, 1999 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was submitted to Warner Bros. Records in 1996, complete with artwork at the same time as \"Chaos and Disorder\", but released three years later, shortly before Prince's Arista album release \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\". The album was recorded from 1985 through 1994. It was the last album to be released by Warner Bros. to fulfill his 1992 contract obligations.\n\nFans often complain that the songs have been overworked and watered down from the original versions that can be heard on various bootlegs, particularly \"Old Friends 4 Sale\". Not much promotion was done in the United States or United Kingdom to support the album. \"Extraordinary\" was occasionally performed during his 2002 One Nite Alone... Tour.\n\n\"The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale\" was Prince's first release with Warner Bros. Records since his eighteenth studio album, \"Chaos and Disorder\" (1996). His previous three albums, \"Emancipation\" (1996), \"Crystal Ball\" (1998), and \"The Truth\" (1998), were all released independently by NPG Records.\n\nUnlike his previous studio albums, Prince did not embark on a concert series or tour and did very little to promote the album. The lack of a proper tour would continue until the release of his twenty-fifth studio album, \"One Nite Alone...\" (2002). Prince's next tour wouldn't be until late 2000, when he began the Hit n Run Tour. \n\n\"Extraordinary\" was released as the album's only and lead single on August 10, 1999, two weeks before the album's scheduled release. The song was released as a CD single and sent to mainstream radio on the same day; the CD single included the album version of the single. The single, however, did not manage to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming his sixth consecutive single to do so.\n\nThree promotional singles were also released from \"The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale\". The first promotional single, \"The Rest of My Life\", was released in Japan in 1999 as a promotional CD single, and included \"Extraordinary\" as the CD's second track. \"5 Women\" was the second promo single, also released as a CD single, but exclusively in Germany. The third and final promotional single, \"It's About That Walk\", was also released in Germany.\n\nAfter its release, \"The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. In a fairly positive review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"an unassuming, jazzy little record that's damn near irresistible.\" Erlewine suggested that the tracks were comparable to the material found on \"Graffiti Bridge\" (1990). \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Marc Weingarten appreciated the album, stating that it \"sounds more committed than a lot of his indie releases\"; however, Weingarten noted that Prince fans would enjoy the album more. \n\nIn a mixed review, Mark Zeltner of PopMatters enjoyed songs \"Extraordinary\" and \"It's About That Walk\", but criticized the record's \"lack of a cohesive musical theme\", also calling the track listing \"a series of songs that were forgotten or discarded long ago by their creator.\" A reviewer from \"Mojo\" was more mixed with the album, calling it \"pleasing though predictable\". Keith Phipps, writing for \"The A.V. Club\", was disappointed by the album, blaming Warner Bros. for the \"none-too-generous selection of material\". Similarly, a critic from \"NME\" found the songs to be \"mediocre\", also noting that Warner Bros. takes \"revenge on their erstwhile slave\".\n\n\"The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale\" was moderately unsuccessful after its release, peaking at the lower positions of most record charts. In the United States, the album debuted and peaked at position eighty-five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number forty-seven, becoming his highest charting album since \"Emancipation\" (1996). The album was somewhat successful in the Netherlands, where it peaked at number sixteen. Elsewhere, the album was unsuccessful. In France and Germany, it peaked at positions sixty-four and forty-four, respectively.\n\nAll songs written and produced by Prince.\n"}

The economic progress made in the period would categorise Hong Kong as one of Four Asian Tigers along with Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nEconomically, this era is considered a major stepping stone for Hong Kong. It is considered the first turning point for Hong Kong's economy. The per capita GDP was still relatively low in 1960. It was approximately the same as Peru, South Africa and Greece in the same decade. By comparison, Argentina had two times and Venezuela had three times the GDP of Hong Kong. The living standard was rising steadily, but low wages continued. The number of registered factories increased from 3,000 in 1950s to 10,000 in 1960s. Registered foreign companies increased from 300 to 500. There were demands for labour in every sector of the economy.\n\nPolitically, however, this era is marked by the political chaos in mainland China.\n\nHong Kong's population in the 1960s is estimated at 3 million. Half of the population was under the age of 25 and the group became Hong Kong's baby boom generation. The surge of refugees continued to come in from China.\n\nThe past generations of Chinese families were deeply rooted in family affairs. The long hours in the factories would break apart that traditional structure when most people spend far more time working in factories than at home. But people lived under a strong willingness to bear sufferings. This was slightly compensated by their close relationship within the community, and cheerful talks in their spare times. Work places mainly served as educational hubs or the \"second home\". Women also joined the work force in larger numbers, becoming working daughters or working mothers.\n\nThe government pursued an ambitious public education programme, creating over 300,000 new primary school places between 1954 and 1961. By 1966, 99.8% of school-age children were attending primary school, though the primary schools were not free.\n\nFrom 6 to 15 December 1969, the first Hong Kong Festival was launched after 7 months of preparation work with HKD $4 million of funding. It originated after the 1967 riots in hopes that people unleash their energy toward a better cause instead of communists' riots. The number of participants reached more than 500,000 including foreign tourists.\n\nThe 1960s cinema films were still rooted in a Chinese tradition, though Hong Kong would have one of their first pop culture teen idol, Connie Chan Po-chu. The arrival of broadcast television would become the first format brewed in Hong Kong to be marketed toward the people of Hong Kong directly. TVB station was founded in 1967 and made the first free-over-the-air broadcast.\n\nThe first disturbance in the 1960s was the Hong Kong 1966 riots over the rising fares of the Star Ferry. A petition was created with 20,000 signatures in protest against any increases in transportation costs. The result led to the arrest of 1,800 people, but the end came swiftly.\n\nOther riots include the Hong Kong 1967 riots which began when internal conflict within the Communist party in China resulted in the Cultural Revolution. Pro-communist leftists in Hong Kong challenged British rule. Demonstrations were held, the red guards would take shape in Hong Kong carrying Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong in their left hands shouting communist slogans. The People's Daily in Beijing ran editorials supporting the leftist struggle. Rumors spread that China was preparing to take over the colony. Political tension soared. The riots only came to an end in December 1967 when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai ordered the leftist groups in Hong Kong to stop. After the riot, the government made an effort to clean up any existing communist networks. The radio host Lam Bun was also murdered.\n\nIn 1963 and 1967, serious droughts affected Hong Kong. Water supply was unable to support the needs of the rapid population growth. The government introduced a water restriction policy. There were periods when water supply was restricted to 4 hours per 4 days. People had to save water for 4 days of usage. Water shortages, however, were mainly created by the politics (see resource section).\n\nIn 1960, Typhoon Mary affected Hong Kong, causing 45 deaths and 127 injuries. It also destroyed about 10,000 homes.\n\nIn 1962, Typhoon Wanda affected Hong Kong, causing 130 deaths. 72,000 people left homeless. It was one of the most disastrous typhoons to ever affect Hong Kong.\n\nThe construction business would also continue to increase along with the demand of highways, buildings, tunnels, and reservoirs. In 1962, the director of public works questioned where to go after the development of Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan. The construction expansion went west to Tuen Mun and north to Sha Tin. The first post-World War II documentation to provide detailed information about the territory came in 1969 in a guide titled the \"Colony Outline Plan\". It was the first paperwork to outline strategies to house a million people with low-cost public housing, along with defining tight regulations and guidelines on how to construct among the high density population.\n\nWhile many companies were beginning to diversify in the products it manufactures, the entire success of the Hong Kong colony rested on the textile industry. An estimated 625,000 residents were supported directly or indirectly by this one industry. The government was depending on its Shanghai entrepreneurs and the industry collectively ran in 3 shifts around the clock. It was from this point that the cheap low-grade products became high-quality products with the \"Made in Hong Kong\" label. By 1968, factories employing fewer than 100 workers accounted for 42 percent of Hong Kong's domestic exports to the UK, amounting to HKD $1.2 billion.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the executive council tried to revamp the medical system to provide some form of low cost health care directly or indirectly to large sections of the population. Staff at the medical and health departments were outlining proposals to estimate demands for the next 15 years. The Hong Kong Flu of 1968 would infect 15% of the population.\n\nDuring the beginning of the Vietnam War, the U.S. made Hong Kong a frequent stop for resting troops in the Asian region. It was considered one of the neutral zones not affected by the communists despite all the political riots taking place.\n\nThe main source of water in Hong Kong was China. A contract was signed in 1964 when Hong Kong purchased 15,000 gallons of water a day drawn from China's East river. When political turmoil came to Hong Kong, China turned off the supply periodically and caused water shortages. Rationing was imposed by the government.\n"}

{"id": "2250232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250232", "title": "Perro Aguayo Jr.", "text": "Perro Aguayo Jr.\n\nPedro Aguayo Ramírez (July 23, 1979 – March 21, 2015) was a Mexican \"luchador\" or professional wrestler and promoter who achieved fame in lucha libre as Perro Aguayo Jr. or El Hijo del Perro Aguayo (\"The Son of Perro Aguayo\"). He was the real-life son of lucha libre legend Perro Aguayo and not a storyline \"Junior\". Aguayo was best known as the leader of the \"Los Perros del Mal\" stable, which he started in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in mid-2004. The stable became a significant draw in Mexican professional wrestling, peaking during Aguayo's storyline rivalries with Místico and Héctor Garza. In October 2008, Aguayo left CMLL to start his own independent professional wrestling promotion \"Perros del Mal Producciones\", built around members of his \"Los Perros del Mal\" stable. In June 2010, Aguayo returned to AAA after a seven-year absence to start an invasion storyline involving his stable. \n\nWhile performing in a wrestling match on March 21, 2015, Aguayo died almost instantly from cardiac arrest after fracturing three vertebrae. Following his death, Aguayo was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.\n\nPedro Aguayo Ramírez was born on July 23, 1979, in Mexico City, Mexico, the son of Luz Ramírez and Pedro Aguayo Damián, a \"luchador\", or professional wrestler known under the ring name Perro Aguayo. His uncle, Jesús Ramírez Ángel, was better known under the name Ídolo and his cousins competed as Ídolo I and Ídolo II. Aguayo's cousin works as \"Pepe Aguayo\", inspired by Perro Sr.\n\nDebuting professionally at the age of 15, Aguayo Jr. started out wrestling established veterans in AAA. He often teamed with his father, and the pair won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship on two occasions, defeating the teams of Fuerza Guerrera/Mosco de la Merced and El Cobarde II/El Cobarde Jr., respectively. Aguayo Jr. worked his first major show on June 18, 1995, when he faced and lost to Juventud Guerrera as part of \"Triplemanía III-B\". Aguayo Jr. formed a team of all \"juniors\", \"Los Junior Atómicos\", including Blue Demon Jr., La Parka Jr. and Máscara Sagrada Jr. The four defeated Charly Manson, May Flowers, Nygma and El Picudo to win the Mexican National Atómicos Championship during a show in Jalisco. Five months later they lost the championship to \"Los Vipers\" (Histeria, Maniaco, Mosco de la Merced and Psicosis) at the 1999 \"Verano de Escándalo\" show. After \"Los Junior Atómicos\" disbanded, Aguayo began teaming regularly with Héctor Garza, engaging in a four-way storyline feud with Heavy Metal and Latin Lover. These four competed in various tag and four-way matches throughout the lengthy feud. One of the highlights of the storyline was Heavy Metal being shaved bald after losing a combination four-way steel cage match and \"lucha de apuesta\" on the 2001 \"Guerra de Titanes\" show, when Garza pinned Heavy Metal. Later on Latin Lover would defeat Garza in another \"lucha de apuesta\". Aguayo Jr. and Garza defeated \"Los Vipers\" (Abismo Negro and Electroshock) to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. The duo held the title for 61 days before losing it to Pirata Morgan and El Texano.\n\nIn May 2003, Aguayo Jr. moved to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). He was initially brought in as a \"técnico\" to team with Negro Casas against \"Los Guerreros del Infierno\", but did not receive the expected positive reactions from the crowd, and CMLL decided to turn him heel by having him win a tournament for a shot at Atlantis' Michinoku Pro Wrestling Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship. He won the tournament over established popular heels like Dr. Wagner Jr. and Rey Bucanero, so by the time he met the babyface Atlantis for the title, he was seen as a heel by the fans. The title challenge was unsuccessful, but Aguayo was quickly put into a program with \"Los Capos\" with the story being he was getting revenge on Universo 2000 for ending his father's career. During this feud, Shocker's popular \"Los Guapos\" group backed Aguayo Jr. and he became a face again. The feud continued through the winter and into 2004 and was ended when Aguayo and El Terrible (a member of Los Guapos) defeated Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 in a double hair vs. hair match at the show. In the spring, Aguayo Jr. once again backed up Negro Casas and Shocker in their feud with Pierroth Jr., Vampiro Canadiense and Tarzan Boy. The two groups went at it in \"trios\", singles, and tag matches before they were put in the annual \"Cage of Death\" match, in which the last two men in the cage, regardless of which team they are on, would face each other in a hair vs. hair match. The heel trio escaped early and Shocker made a quick exit as well. Aguayo Jr. and Casas then faced each other, and Aguayo Jr. pinned Casas, winning his hair. Tensions began to rise between Casas and Aguayo Jr. after that point, and when Héctor Garza jumped to CMLL in July, Aguayo Jr. ditched Casas and joined him. After turning heel again, he took part in the \"Leyenda de Plata\" tournament, held in honor of El Santo. After securing his place in the semifinals, Aguayo Jr. interfered in Negro Casas' match with Atlantis, costing Casas the bout and allowing Atlantis to advance. After defeating Atlantis in the semifinals, Aguayo Jr. faced the previous year's winner, Felino, for the trophy. After Aguayo Jr. won the match, El Hijo del Santo came to the ring to award him the trophy, but Aguayo Jr. smashed it, claiming that Santo wasn't nearly the legend that Perro Aguayo Sr. was. The angle was hot and played off the feud the original Santo and Perro Aguayo had during the 1970s. Due to El Hijo del Santo's short tour with CMLL, the feud was rushed towards an indecisive singles match. The closest thing to closure for the feud was a \"trios\" match at the CMLL 71st Anniversary Show, during which the team of Hijo del Perro Aguayo, Hèctor Garza and El Terrible (soon to be named La Furia del Norte) defeated Hijo del Santo, Negro Casas and Shocker. After that match, Santo focused more on his program with Averno and \"Los Guerreros del Infierno\" and Aguayo Jr. set his sights on Casas (to whom he lost), and the feud cooled down from there.\n\nStarting in November 2004, Aguayo Jr. restarted his feud with \"Los Capos\" by teaming frequently with Vampiro and Pierroth Jr., who were also feuding with Los Capos at the time. At the year-end show, he had another singles match with Universo 2000 which led to Aguayo's father running in and making the save. In February 2005, Perro Aguayo Sr. returned to wrestling for one match, teaming with his son against Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 in a double hair vs. hair match. The Aguayos won the match (which was also billed as Cien Caras' retirement match), in the main event of the 2005 \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\" show. After the match, \"La Familia de Tijuana\" (Halloween, Damián 666), and Aguayo Jr. decided to start a new faction, \"Los Perros del Mal\" (\"The Bad Dogs\"). Soon, the group would consist of Aguayo Jr., \"La Familia\", \"La Furia del Norte\", Blue Demon Jr., Pierroth Jr. and Pierroth's storyline sons. The group took on many rivals, including Negro Casas, Felino, Heavy Metal (who had just jumped from AAA), Máscara Mágica, Universo 2000 and Aguayo's new focus, the rising star Místico, who had defeated him in a main event singles match. The two agreed to a hair vs. mask match, but no date was specified. \"Los Perros del Mal\" faced off against their rivals in the 2005 \"Cage of Death\" match, in which Damián 666 took the hair of Máscara Mágica. On May 5, 2006, Aguayo Jr. was defeated by Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and El Canek in a three-way match for the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in Nezahualcoyotl. Aguayo Jr.'s final major feud in CMLL was with Héctor Garza, which culminated in a Hair vs. Hair match on March 21, 2008, at \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\", which Aguayo Jr. won via a low blow.\n\nAguayo Jr. left CMLL in October 2008, along with fellow \"Los Perros Del Mal\" members Damián 666 and Mr. Águila, to start his own promotion called \"Perros del Mal Producciones\". The new promotion's debut show took place on December 7, 2008, in Mexico City. On that show, Aguayo Jr. tag-teamed with Cibernético and Dr. Wagner Jr. to face L.A. Park, Olímpico and Headhunter A, and was victorious.\n\nOn June 6, 2010, at Triplemanía XVIII, Aguayo returned to AAA to lead \"Perros del Mal\" in an invasion of the promotion. The group quickly aligned themselves with Konnan and Dorian Roldan's \"La Legión Extranjera\", \"La Milicia\" and \"Los Maniacos\" to form \"La Sociedad\". On August 14 at \"Verano de Escandalo\" El Hijo del Perro Aguayo wrestled his first major match for AAA since his return, when he, L.A. Park and Damián 666 defeated El Mesías, Cibernético and La Parka in a six-man tag team match, when Perro pinned Mesías. On October 1 at \"Héroes Inmortales IV\" El Mesías defeated Perro in a singles match. Afterwards, Aguayo injured his knee, sidelining him for the rest of the year. However, he made a surprise appearance on December 5, 2010 during the main event of \"Guerra de Titanes\", helping Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly hand \"Los Psycho Circus\" their first-ever loss in a steel cage weapons match. On March 18, 2011, at Rey de Reyes, Aguayo Jr. joined Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy in a winning effort against \"Potencia Mundial\" (Dr. Wagner Jr. and Los Psycho Circus); Aguayo Jr. pinned Wagner with \"La Lanza\", following a chair shot.\n\nOn April 8, 2011. Aguayo Jr. underwent emergency surgery to remove a golf ball-sized tumor from his stomach. During the surgery, a peptic ulcer burst, and he was placed in an intensive care unit at the hospital in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Aguayo Jr. was released from the hospital on April 19 and was scheduled to receive treatment for his condition for a full year. Aguayo's tumor was found to be benign; Aguayo made his return to AAA, in a non–wrestling role, on May 1 and returned to the ring on May 8 in a six-man tag team match pitting \"Los Perros del Mal\" against \"Los Psycho Circus\"; Aguayo pinned Psycho Clown after a low blow. The feud continued on May 29 at \"Perros del Mal Producciones\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> third anniversary show, when \"Los Psycho Circus\" defeated \"Los Perros del Mal\" in a six-man tag team steel cage mask vs. hair match. As a result, Super Crazy, the last man left in the cage, was shaved bald. Aguayo Jr. was set to wrestle as part of \"Los Perros del Mal\" at Triplemanía XIX, facing \"Los Psycho Circus\" to determine the first-ever AAA World Trios Champions, but was forced to pull out of the event due to an adverse reaction to the medication given to him as part of his tumor treatment. Aguayo returned on July 24 at a \"Perros del Mal\" event, teaming with Damián 666 and Halloween against Blue Demon Jr., Cassandro and L.A. Park; the match ended in a no contest when Park turned on his partners. Aguayo Jr. next returned to AAA on August 19, replacing L.A. Park and teaming with Damián 666 and Halloween against El Mesías, Joe Líder and El Zorro in a six-man tag team match, which they lost via disqualification when Líder was attacked by his former tag team partner Nicho el Millonario. After the match, Aguayo officially named Nicho the newest member of \"Los Perros del Mal\". Aguayo Jr. returned to pay-per-view on October 9, 2011 at Héroes Inmortales, unsuccessfully challenging Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship in a bullterrier match. Afterward, Aguayo Jr. began a feud with Jack Evans. On December 16, 2011 at Guerra de Titanes, Aguayo and Evans continued their rivalry in a six-man tag team match, during which they busted each other open. The match was won when Aguayo Jr.'s teammate Héctor Garza pinned Fénix. The feud between Aguayo Jr. and Evans continued through to \"Rey de Reyes\" on March 18, 2012, when Aguayo Jr. pinned Evans to win the \"Rey de Reyes\" tournament and earn a chance to contend for the AAA Mega Championship. On August 5 at \"Triplemanía XX\", Aguayo Jr. unsuccessfully challenged El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Aguayo Jr. started a year-long rivalry with Cibernético, which culminated in a \"lucha de apuesta\" in the main event of Triplemanía XXI on June 16, 2013. Aguayo Jr. was victorious, forcing Cibernético to have his head shaved bald.\n\nIn August 2013, Aguayo teamed with Cibernético against his former stable, \"La Secta\". On October 18 at \"Héroes Inmortales VII\", \"La Secta\" eliminated Aguayo Jr., Cibernético, and El Mesías from the Copa Antonio Peña, which led to the three retaliating by costing \"Secta\" members Dark Escoria and Dark Espiritu their match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship. Aguayo Jr.'s \"tecnico\" turn was completed on November 22, when \"Los Perros del Mal\" members Daga and Psicosis turned on him, labeling him a traitor for teaming with Cibernético. However, on December 8 at \"Guerra de Titanes\", Aguayo Jr. turned on Cibernético, rejoined Daga and Psicosis and brought \"Los Perros del Mal\" back under the umbrella of the reformed \"La Sociedad\". On August 17, 2014, at Triplemanía XXII, Aguayo Jr. started a new feud with the debuting El Patrón by attacking him and his father Dos Caras at the start of the show. Later that night in the main event, Aguayo Jr. defeated Cibernético, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Myzteziz, in a four-way elimination match to win Copa Triplemanía XXII. After the match, Aguayo Jr. was immediately attacked by El Patrón. Subsequently, Aguayo Jr. and El Texano Jr. defeated El Patrón and El Mesías at \"Héroes Inmortales VIII\". In subsequent months, Aguayo Jr. focused on Myzteziz, and resuming the storyline that started in CMLL when Myzteziz was known as Místico, by issuing a challenge for a mask vs. hair match at Triplemanía XXIII. The story led to the main event of the 2015 \"Rey de Reyes\", in which Aguayo Jr. teamed up with Pentagón Jr., only to lose to Myzteziz and the returning Rey Mysterio Jr..\n\nOn March 20, 2015, Aguayo wrestled a tag team match, teaming with Manik against Rey Mysterio Jr. and Xtreme Tiger at a show for The Crash promotion in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. During the match, Mysterio used a headscissors takedown to propel Aguayo out of the ring, but Aguayo returned to the ring, upon which Mysterio dropkicked Aguayo in the back/shoulder to set up for Mysterio's signature \"619\" as Aguayo landed on the middle rope (the proper position for the \"619\"). Manik then fell onto the middle rope beside Aguayo—when Aguayo appeared to be limp and unconscious, Manik shook him slightly to revive him. Mysterio performed the \"619\", but did not hit either opponent. While the match continued, Konnan, who was at ringside, then attempted to revive the seemingly unconscious Aguayo by shaking him. The match still continued, with Mysterio next checking on the unmoving Aguayo, bringing it to the referee's attention. The match continued, with Mysterio pinning Manik at the center of the ring while Konnan again attempted to revive Aguayo.\n\nWith the match over, various personnel went to Aguayo, believing he was just unconscious and in need of medical help. Officials later brought Aguayo out of the ring. When paramedics arrived, Aguayo was brought to the local Del Prado hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 1:00am on March 21. Aguayo was 35 years old.\n\nAccording to the initial statement by the hospital, Aguayo died from a cervical spine trauma, reportedly as a result of the dropkick by Mysterio Jr. that propelled him forward to the ring ropes, causing severe whiplash trauma that snapped his neck. The cause of death was later determined as cardiac arrest, due to a cervical stroke caused by three fractured vertebrae. Autopsy results showed that Aguayo Jr. broke his C1, C2, and C3 vertebrae. The coroner stated that the fractures took place at two different moments of impact and that Aguayo died almost instantly. Aguayo Jr. was not immediately attended to by a physician and was actually taken from the ring on a piece of plywood instead of a stretcher, which led to some criticism of the event organizers. However, the coroner stated that it made no difference. The Tijuana wrestling commission later explained that the doctor was backstage, attending to two other injuries that happened during the show. One of those injuries was a spinal injury and they did not want to remove that wrestler from the stretcher he was on, which was why they used the plywood to move Aguayo from the ring. The doctors worked on resuscitating Aguayo for over an hour before declaring him dead. On March 21, the attorney general for Baja California conducted an investigation into Aguayo's death but no criminal charges were filed. Aguayo Jr. was buried in Guadalajara on March 23 with Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. serving as pallbearers. After his death, the \"Comisión de Deporte del Senado del México\" (The Commission of Sport of the Mexican Senate) presented the initiative \"Ley para la Seguridad del Deporte en el País\" (Law for the Safety of Sport in the Country\").\n\nMany promotions, including AAA, CMLL, The Crash, Lucha Underground and World Wrestling League (WWL), paid tribute to Aguayo Jr. following his death. On August 9 at Triplemanía XXIII, Aguayo Jr. was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

Due to the fact that the recording is owned by a private party, it is unauthorized but not a bootleg. It features Alice Cooper's infamous chicken-throwing performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival at Varsity Stadium in Toronto on September 13, 1969 and showcases the early psychedelic music style of Cooper and his band in support of their very first album release, \"Pretties for You\".\n\nAlthough the album was originally released on vinyl in 1982, it has been re-released many times over the years on vinyl, cassette, CD, and digital download by various record labels under different titles, using alternative track titles and track orders. Many of these re-releases additionally include two 1964 studio tracks by Ronnie Hawkins, falsely credited on the album to Alice Cooper.\n\nIn 1996, Brian Nelson, Alice Cooper's personal assistant, said concerning this releases: \"The rights to the recording were sold by Alice's management at the time of the recording to a third party. That party has licensed out the rights to the recording many times to various companies. Alice Cooper do not make a penny from it. My theory is that the two non-Alice songs somehow wound up on the original master tape. The distributors not knowing and not particularly caring, put the album out of the tape as is. When the album was pressed again later by other companies, they didn't bother to check if all the songs were Alice or not. They would have no particular reason to.\"\n\nIn 2012 the label Applebush released another version of this concert with the title Nobody Likes Us under the moniker of The Alice Cooper Group. This is the first known CD release to feature the whole concert speed corrected, correct song titles, and chronological track listing. Guitarist Michael Bruce advised how to name and to arrange the titles correctly. The sound quality is also better than on all of the other releases. As a bonus it also contains recordings of a concert at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco on March 30, 1969, but the sound quality of that show is poor.\n\nSince the first release in 1982 this Toronto festival show has been released many times from many different labels with many different cover artworks and track listings. Noteworthy is that the track listing differs very often. Most editions have eight tracks as the original release. Some editions have seven tracks. These ones merged the \"Group Instrumental\" and \"I've Written Home to Mother\". A few releases since 2000 consist of nine tracks. These releases added a medley of four songs: \"Ain't That Just Like a Woman\", \"Goin' to the River\", \"Nobody Likes Me (Live)\" and \"Science Fiction (Live)\". But this medley doesn't include any new material. It just contains parts of these four songs you can already find on this release, which were simply put together. Worth mentioning is, that there is only one release except the completely correct \"Nobody Likes Us\" since 1982, which omitted the two Ronnie Hawkins songs: A 1988 cassette release via Golden Circle named \"Science Fiction\".\n\nAnother interesting detail is, that some releases mention strange songwriters for all the Alice Cooper compositions (not the Ronnie Hawkins ones). Probably this happened because of all the wrong song titles.\n\nThe following list with many different releases is not intended to be exhaustive. It should just be an overview.\nNoteworthy is, that \"Live At Toronto Rock 'N' Roll Revival 1969\" from 2018 is the only one digital release to date which omits the Ronnie Hawkins tracks and partly uses the correct song titles. \"An Instrumental\" and \"I've Written Home to Mother\" weren't renamed, but it is mentioned that these songs are parts of \"Lay Down and Die, Goodbye\".\n"}

It was rated an F4 when it made a direct hit on the subdivision. The tornado touched down just northwest of Athens. It tracked from that point through eastern Limestone County, through Harvest, Meridianville, and New Market in northern Madison County, Alabama, and ended near Princeton in northwest Jackson County, Alabama. The strongest portion of the tornado's path was near Harvest in northwest Madison County around the Anderson Hills subdivision and the Huntsville Dragway, which is the reason it is usually referred to as the \"Anderson Hills Tornado\".\n\nThe tornado first touched down at 5:33 p.m. approximately three miles northwest of Athens, just east of State Route 99. The tornado moved across State Route 127, then across I-65 near the interchange with U.S. Highway 31. From there, the tornado strengthened as it continued east, crossing State Route 251, where it destroyed 13 mobile homes at the Oakdale Mobile Home Park. At this point of devastation, one person received major injuries from the tornado and died two days later; Chuck Dale, 30 years of age, was the one fatality of the tornado. Around this time, a Tornado Warning was issued for Madison County to give residents on the northwest side of the county an opportunity to take cover; tornado sirens were activated at 5:43 p.m., one minute after the warning was issued. Meanwhile, the tornado began to move slightly north of east, moving across Mooresville Road and crossing through the Copeland community near the intersection of Copeland Road and East Limestone Road. It continued to strengthen as it crossed over Limestone Creek and approached the Madison County line. Overall in Limestone County, 35 buildings were damaged or destroyed, and 26 mobile homes were destroyed. Around 9,500 customers lost electricity in the county, where damage was estimated to be $1.5 million.\n\nThe tornado crossed into Madison County around 5:50 p.m. on Love Branch Road, just north of the Yarbrough Road intersection. It continued an east-northeasterly path across Carroll Road, Old Railroad Bed Road, and Wall Triana Highway, crossing just south of Harvest Elementary School. At 5:52 p.m., Madison County Fire dispatch reported that the tornado was on the ground near Harvest. The now violent tornado moved directly into Harvest and crossed Fords Chapel Road before taking a direct hit on the Anderson Hills subdivision along State Route 53. At this point, the tornado was at F4 intensity and the subsequent survey would also reveal evidence of it having multiple vortices. A total of 39 well-constructed houses in the subdivision sustained major damage, and 21 were destroyed. The Piggly Wiggly along Highway 53 also received damage. At 5:54 p.m., the Madison County Sheriff's Department confirmed the tornado had crossed Old Railroad Bed Road and State Route 53. As a result of these reports, tornado sirens were reactivated in Madison County one minute later. The tornado continued east-northeast making a glancing blow to the Huntsville Dragway before crossing Quarter Mountain Road and Bollweevil Lane on the northern face of Quarter Mountain. Next it crossed Hammond Lane (where it caused major damage to a few two story brick homes), Beaver Dam Road, Beaverdam Creek, and Pulaski Pike. It moved over Beaverdam Creek a second time at Mount Lebanon Road as it moved into the Meridianville area, then across Patterson Lane. Shortly after 6:00 p.m., the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 231/431 at Steger Curve – around Brier Fork bridge. Here, substantial damage was done to a cotton gin and a large farm house was spun off its foundation.\n\nFrom the highway, the tornado continued slightly north of east, tracking basically along Steger Road to near its intersection with McCollum Road. It moved across farmland, then crossed Moores Mill Road just south of Moores Mill School (now known as Lynn Fanning School). Several windows at the school were shattered. East of here, the tornado caused damage on the south end of the Timberwind subdivision before crossing the Flint River between Meridianville and New Market. At 6:13 p.m., a Madison County Sheriff's deputy radioed that the tornado was passing over his car on Butler Road. Also at this time, a Tornado Warning was issued for Jackson County. The tornado continued east of here causing structural damage along Arnold Road and Noles Drive before crossing Mountain Fork. It then moved across Sharon Johnson Park, causing mostly tree and minor structural damage. It then struck several homes in the Colony Square subdivision before crossing Winchester Road in New Market. At this point, the tornado path became more easterly as it moved into the more rugged terrain of northeastern Madison County. It reached the Jackson County border at 6:21 p.m. All told, over 10,000 Huntsville Utilities customers lost power during the storm.\n\nThe tornado weakened considerably as it moved across Putnam Mountain in northwest Jackson County, before ending near Princeton.

Wild was a musically precocious child and studied under Selmar Janson at the Carnegie Institute of Technology there, and later with Marguerite Long, Egon Petri, and Helene Barere (the wife of Simon Barere), among others. As a teenager, he started making transcriptions of romantic music and composition.\n\nIn 1931 he was invited to play at the White House by President Herbert Hoover. The next five presidents (Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson), also invited him to play for them, and Wild remains the only pianist to have played for six consecutive presidents.\n\nIn 1937, Wild was hired as a staff pianist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1939, he became the first pianist to perform a recital on U.S. television. Wild later recalled that the small studio became so hot under the bright lights that the ivory piano keys started to warp.\n\nIn 1942, Arturo Toscanini invited him for a performance of Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which was, for Wild, a resounding success, although Toscanini himself has been criticized for not understanding the jazz idiom in which Gershwin wrote. During World War II, Wild served in the United States Navy as a musician. He often travelled with Eleanor Roosevelt while she toured the United States supporting the war effort. Wild's duty was to perform the national anthem on the piano before she spoke. A few years after the war he moved to the newly formed American Broadcasting Company (ABC) as a staff pianist, conductor and composer until 1968. He performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston in 1952, 1968, and 1971 and three concerts of Liszt in 1986. Wild was renowned for his virtuoso recitals and master classes held around the world, from Seoul, Beijing, and Tokyo to Argentina, England and throughout the United States.\n\nWild created numerous virtuoso solo piano transcriptions, including 14 songs by Rachmaninoff (1981), and several works on themes by Gershwin, as well as transcriptions of Berlioz, Buxtehude, Chopin, Fauré, Saint-Saëns, and Tchaikovsky. His \"Grand Fantasy on Airs from Porgy and Bess\" (1973), in the style of the grand opera fantasies of Liszt, is the first extended piano paraphrase on an American opera, and was recorded in 1976 with its concert premiere in Pasadena on December 17, 1977. He also wrote two sets of \"Virtuoso Etudes after Gershwin\" (in 1954 and 1973) based on Gershwin songs such as \"The Man I Love\", \"Embraceable You\", \"Fascinating Rhythm\" and \"I Got Rhythm\", and \"Theme and Variations on George Gershwin's Someone to Watch Over Me\" (1989).\n\nOther notable piano arrangements include an \"Air and Variations\" on Handel's \"Harmonious Blacksmith\" (1993), a loose arrangement of a Bach Sarabande in the style of Poulenc entitled \"Hommage à Poulenc\" (1995), and another Liszt-style fantasy \"Reminiscences of Snow White\" (1995), based on music from the animated Disney film. In 2004 he made several piano transcriptions of popular songs of the 1920s. There is also a piano and orchestra arrangement of music from Richard Rodgers' \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\" (1967).\n\nHe also wrote a number of original works. These include a large-scale Easter oratorio \"Revelations\" (1962), a work for chorus and percussion \"The Turquoise Horse\" (1975) based on an American Indian poem and legend, the \"Doo-Dah Variations\" on a theme by Stephen Foster (1992), a 27-minute composition in several colorfully-titled movements, for piano and orchestra as well as a two-piano version (1995), \"Adventure\" (1941) for piano and orchestra, an early piano concerto (1932), and an early ballet \"Persephone\" (1934). His \"Sonata 2000\", written that year, had its first performance by Bradley Bolen in 2003 and was recorded by Wild for Ivory Classics. In 2004 he wrote a suite of Belly-Dances for piano.\n\nIn the mid-1950s he wrote music for many silent movie and opera sketches for Sid Caesar's television shows, and in the 1960s he composed music for several television documentaries, television plays, and an off-broadway play by Harold Robbins \"A Stone for Danny Fisher\" (1960).\n\nWild recorded for several labels, including RCA Records, where he recorded an album of Liszt and a collection of music by George Gershwin, including \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" \"Cuban Overture,\" Concerto in F, and \"I Got Rhythm\" Variations, all with the Boston Pops Orchestra and Arthur Fiedler. In 1965 he recorded for Readers Digest the four Rachmaninoff piano concertos and Paganini Rhapsody in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jascha Horenstein, originally issued as a set of vinyl LPs. These were later reissued on CD by Chesky and Chandos. Later in his career, Wild recorded for Ivory Classics.\n\nUnder his teacher Selmar Janson, Wild had learned Xaver Scharwenka's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, which Janson had studied directly with the composer, his own teacher. When, over 40 years later, Erich Leinsdorf asked Wild to record the concerto, he was able to say \"I've been waiting by the phone for forty years for someone to ask me to play this\".\n\nIn 1997 he was the first pianist to stream a performance over the Internet.\n\nWild, who was openly gay, lived in Columbus, Ohio, and Palm Springs, California, with his domestic partner of 38 years, Michael Rolland Davis. He was also an atheist. He died aged 94 of congestive heart disease at home in Palm Springs.\n\nHarold C. Schonberg called him a \"super-virtuoso in the Horowitz class\".\n\nWild's memoirs \"A Walk on the Wild Side\" were published posthumously by Ivory Classics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2250267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250267", "title": "Décolletage", "text": "Décolletage\n\nDécolletage (or décolleté, its adjectival form, in current French) is a term used in woman's fashion referring to the upper part of a woman's torso, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and upper chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. The term is most commonly used in Western female fashions and is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage. Low-cut necklines are a feature of ball gowns, evening gowns, leotards, lingerie and swimsuits, among other fashions. Although décolletage does not itself prescribe the extent of exposure of a woman's upper chest, the design of a décolleté garment takes into account current fashions, aesthetics, social norms and the occasion when a garment will be worn.\n\nThough neckline styles have varied in Western societies and décolletage may be regarded as aesthetic and an expression of femininity, in some parts of the world any décolletage is considered provocative and shocking.\n\nDécolletage is a French word which is derived from \"décolleter\", meaning to reveal the neck. The term was first used in English literature sometime before 1831. In strict usage, décolletage is the neckline extending about two handbreadths from the base of the neck down, front and back.\n\nIn Indonesia (especially in Java), a breast cloth known as \"kemben\" was worn for centuries until the 20th century. Today, shoulder-exposing gowns still feature in many Indonesian rituals.\n\nGowns which exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and non-controversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage. During that long period, low-cut dresses partially exposing breasts were considered more acceptable than they are today; a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders were considered more risqué than exposed breasts.\n\nIn 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c. 1480.\n\nBased on woodcut prints, a researcher has argued that during the 17th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. Anne of Brittany has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.\n\nIn aristocratic and upper-class circles, the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol, as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position. From the Renaissance onwards, the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical Greece that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period.\nAfter the French Revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses which bared the bosom and shoulders. James Gillray's caricature of 1796 shows Lady Georgiana Gordon (1781–1853, then only 14), not yet Duchess of Bedford, at a rout-party gambling at a game called \"Pope Joan\". She is wearing an extreme décolletage, as was fashionable.\n\nDuring the Victorian period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end of the 19th century), the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions. (See 1880s in fashion.) In 1884, a portrait painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Paris socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, was criticised when she was depicted in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884, his reputation in tatters. The painting was named \"Portrait of Madame X\".\n\nWhen it became fashionable, around 1913, for dresses to be worn with what would now be considered a relatively modest round or V-shaped neckline, clergymen all over the world became deeply shocked. In the German Empire, all of the Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions. Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more permitted in Western societies, during World War I and remained so for nearly half a century.\nIn 1953, Hollywood film \"The French Line\" was found objectionable under the strict Hays Code with some of Jane Russell's décolletage gowns being described as \"intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme décolletage\". But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, Gina Lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations.\n\nDuring a short period in 1964, \"topless\" dress designs appeared at fashion shows, but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges.\n\nLow necklines usually result in increased décolletage. In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body, and especially breast, exposure is acceptable in public. What is considered the appropriate neckline varies by context, and is open to differences of opinion. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, Southwest Airlines crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters, or to leave the plane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel created controversy when she wore a low-cut evening gown to the opening of the Oslo Opera House in 2008. In the 2010s, fashion which covered more of women's bodies became more popular, including higher or crew-cut necklines.\n\n\n\n"}

Sometimes referred to as the \"cradle of Johannesburg\", it is where the first gold diggings started, and where the first diggers initially settled. The city grew around the mining camp in the Ferreirasdorp area, and Johannesburg’s Main Street developed from a rough track where the present Albert Street led off towards Ferreira’s Camp.\n\nThe suburb is named after Colonel Ignatius Ferreira, leader of the original group of diggers who settled in this area in 1886.\n\nThe suburb's origins lie in the Turffontein farm set up by Colonel Ignatius Ferreira, a Boer adventurer from Cape Colony. Ferreira had acquired a dozen claims in the vicinity and opened the reef in a cutting. The ore from both sides had a high gold content. The first tent on the site was erected in 1886, two months before gold digging started in earnest.\n\nIn 1886 Hans Sauer, who combined a medical practice with prospecting on Cecil Rhodes’s behalf, was guided from Ferreira’s Camp to the main group of gold reefs by a son of the widow Petronella Oosthuizen, the owner of a farm at Langlaagte, on which the main gold reefs had first been discovered.\n\nFollowing reports of new gold finds in the Witwatersrand, Rhodes and Rudd set off for Ferreira's camp. Already at the time of Rhodes' visit, a little crowd of diggers were at work, and in the week that had passed since Sauer had been away, an Englishwoman had run up a reed and mud building called Walker's Hotel.\n\nWithin a fortnight of Rhodes' arrival in July 1886, Ferreira's camp was crowded with tents and wagons from across southern Africa. The tent town eventually became known as Ferreira’s Camp. In July, the Diamond Fields Advertiser was already reporting that the population of Ferreira's Town was 300 persons.\n\nGold was discovered in September 1886. On September 8, 1886, Landrost Carl von Brandis read President Paul Kruger’s proclamation, confirming the gold fields of the Rand as public diggings. When, in November 1886, a portion of the farm Randjeslaagte had been laid out as a village and named Johannesburg, the Government took over Ferreira's camp and had it properly surveyed and named Ferreira's Township.\nThe first building to go up in Johannesburg, the Central Hotel, was located in Ferreira’s Camp. The first barber shop in Johannesburg, the first bar, the first pub and the first brothel were all opened in Ferreira's Camp. So were the first circus, Fillis's Circus (in September 1886); the first café, Café Francais (in 1886), and the first school (in November 1886). It was also the location of the first bank branch on the Witwatersrand gold fields, when Standard Bank started doing business in a tent in Ferreira's Camp, in 1886. On 11 October 1887, Ferreirasdorp was incorporated into Johannesburg.\n\nAs the city expanded, Ferreirasdorp quickly degenerated into a slum. By the 1890s, the western side of Commissioner street, where the Johannesburg Central Police Station is now located, had developed a reputation for its brothels and the gangs that controlled them. The name Ferreirasdorp itself ultimately became \"synonymous with practically everything that is vile and violent\" about Johannesburg.\n\nBy the turn of the century, many contemporary sources referred to the western part of Ferreirasdorp as the 'Cantonese quarter'. The area became home to a large coloured community, and in 1898 a site was set aside for a church (St. Alban’s Anglican Mission Church) to service the coloured Anglican community. In 1925, the Communist Party of South Africa opened a school offering night classes to blacks, but it was closed during the party purges of the 1930s. In the 1960s, under the Group Areas Act, the coloured community was forcibly moved.\n\nA number of cultural heritage sites are present in the area:\n"}

In 1894, Jeppestown was described as consisting of \"421 buildings, two churches, a Masonic temple, St Mary's Collegiate for Girls and a library\". In 1896, the suburb had 5,647 inhabitants. St Michael's School for Boys, which has since been renamed Jeppe High School for Boys, was established in 1890, and the piece of open land called Julius Jeppe Oval was converted to a park in approximately the same year. The eastern part of Jeppestown came to be known as Belgravia.\n\nThe \"Jeppestown Tragedy\" was a shootout that took place between police and armed robbers on 25 June 2006. Four policemen and eight robbers were killed before the remaining 15 gang members surrendered.\n"}

In 1933 she won the International Franz Liszt Piano Competition in her native city. Throughout her career she played mainly in Europe and Australia, but was seldom heard in the United States until late in her lifetime, giving only two concerts there by that time.\n\nShe was married to influential critic and musicologist (and later director of the Budapest Opera) Aladar Toth (1898–1968); she is buried next to him in Budapest.\n\nFischer fled with her husband to Sweden in 1940, after Hungary during World War II joined the Axis powers. After the war, in 1946, she and Toth returned to Budapest. She died there in 1995.\n\nHer playing has been praised for its \"characteristic intensity\" and \"effortless manner of phrasing\" (David Hurwitz), as well as its technical power and spiritual depth. She was greatly admired by such contemporaries as Otto Klemperer and Sviatoslav Richter; Richter wrote, \"Annie Fischer is a great artist imbued with a spirit of greatness and genuine profundity.\" The Italian pianist Maurizio Pollini praised the \"childlike simplicity, immediacy and wonder\" he found in her playing. Her interpretations of Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert and Schumann, as well as Hungarian composers like Béla Bartók continue to receive the highest praise from pianists and critics.\n\nFischer made significant studio recordings in the 1950s with Otto Klemperer and Wolfgang Sawallisch, but felt that any interpretation created in the absence of an audience would necessarily be artificially constricting, since no interpretation was ever \"finished.\" Her legacy today thus includes many live concert recordings that have been released on CD and DVD (including a performance of Beethoven's \"Emperor\" concerto available on YouTube, and a Beethoven Third Concerto with Antal Doráti conducting). Her greatest legacy, however, is a studio-made integral set of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas. She worked on this set for 15 years beginning in 1977. A self-critical perfectionist, she did not allow the set to be released in her lifetime but, since her death, it has been released on compact disc and widely praised.\n\nAnnie Fischer's recordings have been released by several major record companies, which include: BBC Records, Doremi, EMI Classics, Hungaroton, Orfeo, Palexa, Q Disc, Urania, Melodiya and ICA Classics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2250358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250358", "title": "Aarhus Cathedral", "text": "Aarhus Cathedral\n\nAarhus Cathedral () is a cathedral in Aarhus, Denmark. It is the longest and tallest church in the country, at in length and in height. \n\nThe construction of Aarhus Cathedral began in the 12th century and it is the main edifice of the diocese of Aarhus for the Church of Denmark, dedicated to the patron saint of sailors, St. Clemens. The cathedral is situated on the port side of the central square of Store Torv (Large Square), with address \"Domkirkepladsen 2, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark\" in the inner city. The church can seat around 1200 people.\n\nIt is unknown exactly when people first settled near the mouth of the Aarhus River on the east coast of Jutland. Certainly in the 700s there was a Viking town there. Recent research has dated the building of the first city wall to 934. Aarhus must have been a town of some importance in the Viking Age, as there are six runestones in or near the city. The name is known as Aros, Arus, Aarhus or Aars, as early as the 15th century. The city's charter of 1449 names it \"Aarss\". After the Reformation in Denmark, the name \"Aarhus\" became current.\n\nAarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built during the reign of Frode King of Jutland around year 900 on top of the city's pagan burial site in what was then the center of town. The first bishop was Reginbrand, a missionary bishop of Aros in 948 under the Archbishop of Hamburg. Aros came under the rule of the Archbishop of Viborg in 1060. According to Adam of Bremen, Aros was made a dependent diocese before 998.\n\nSt. Nikolai's church was the first cathedral of Aros. The second cathedral was a timber structure built in 1102 by bishop Ulfketil near the present site to house the relics of St. Clement. St. Clement was an early Bishop of Rome who was martyred by having an anchor tied to his neck and thrown into the Black Sea, according to a fictional biography of the saint. Clement was the patron saint of sailors and especially popular in Scandinavia. The first St. Clement's church burned at some point before the 1190s. \nThis timber church was the center of the local veneration of St. Niels of Aarhus (also called St. Nickolas). St. Niels was a younger son of King Canute V. As a young man, Prince Niels lost interest in life at court and withdrew to the village of Skibby near Aarhus and built a church with his own hands. He lived a saintly life and helped the people in the area around Aarhus. One day, as he and a few men from the town were felling trees to build the church at Viby near the sea, one of the men complained that he was thirsty. St. Niels prayed for water and a spring appeared to slake the man's thirst; St. Niels's Spring has run ever since. It has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years and many miraculous healings are said to have taken place there, especially on St. John's Day. On his death bed in 1180, St. Niels asked to be buried in \"the little church by the sea\" (St. Clements). He was buried in the churchyard at St. Clements.\nThe construction of Aarhus Cathedral began in the decade after year 1190, by Bishop Peder Vognsen (d.11 April 1204) of the powerful Hvide family from Zealand. Bishop Vognsen built the cathedral around St. Clement's church because local people venerated St. Niels, and Vognsen wanted to harness that devotion for his cathedral. Vognsen also established the cathedral school of Aarhus Katedralskole, before the cathedral was completed. The church was finished in 1300 in typical Romanesque style with half-rounded arches supporting a flat timber ceiling. The second St. Clements was built of large red bricks, a new building material that became popular all over Scandinavia and northern Germany for ecclesiastical and public buildings. Four chapels were built into the north transept. The episcopal chair was moved from Our Lady Church to St. Clements.\n\nHowever, in 1330, the cathedral and much of the town burned down, and the church was abandoned until 1449. By then the Gothic style of architecture had reached Denmark, and the cathedral was enlarged in stages until it reached its present size in year 1500. The nave was lengthened to 93 meters, the longest in Denmark. The transept was widened, and the typical Gothic vaulting raised the ceilings and permitted high windows which fill the building with light.\n\nThe Reformation changed life in and around the cathedral in many significant ways. In 1524 Hans Tausen (1494–1561), the Danish Luther, taught a Good Friday sermon at Antvarskov Abbey proclaiming the doctrines of Luther. His superior ordered him imprisoned in the Hospitallers monastery in Viborg, Jutland. Tausen taught from his cell and ordinary people responded with enthusiasm. His superior tried to silence Tausen, but a near riot forced his release. In the beginning, he was allowed to preach in the open air but his supporters broke open a Franciscan church, and soon Tausen had more followers than the church could accommodate. Within a year, he was the king's own chaplain. Luther's ideas quickly spread to Aarhus and soon the townspeople demanded the right to hear the liturgy in Danish. The bishop and canons attempted to stop the spread of the Lutheran doctrine in their diocese, but Tausen had caught the imagination of the people and they would not be cowed by anything the bishop might threaten. Most nobles were staunchly Catholic, and that brought even more support from common people. By 1528 most of the cities had begun the process of reforming their churches. Tausen taught that tearing apart ancient churches was wrong and that orderly change should be used to reform the church.\nIn 1533 Frederik I died and his son, Christian III was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: \"Landsting\"), but the State Council denominated by the Catholic bishops refused to accept the election and called upon count Christopher of Oldenburg to assist in restoring Catholic Christian II to the throne. This resulted in a two-year war called the Count's Feud. Despite the odds, Christian III prevailed and in the summer of 1536 arrested several of the bishops and threw them into prison. The last Roman Catholic Bishop of Aarhus, Ove Bille (d. 1555) was imprisoned in the summer of 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation.\nThe tower is the tallest in Denmark at 96 meters. It received its present form in 1931.\nIn 1642 lightning struck the tower and set it ablaze, destroying some of the historic bells, but damage to the interior of the church was minimal.\n\nAarhus Cathedral has a number of fresco paintings dating from the 1470 to 1520. Until the Reformation, most of the church's walls were covered in frescoes, of which many were lost. The cathedral still has 220 m of frescoes, more than any other church in Denmark. One pre-1470 painting was saved from the first Romanesque-style cathedral in the northwest corner, the so-called \"Lazarus Window\", painted about 1300. It is believed that the window was used to give food to the lepers who weren't permitted inside the building.\n\nThe paintings of St Christopher and St Clement are the tallest in the country. Other figures include St Michael and St George with the dragon (pictured, left).\n\nSt Clements only has one stained glass window. It was created by Norwegian artist Emanuel Vigeland (1875–1948) in 1926. Its theme is taken from N. F. S. Grundtvig's hymn \"Da livtræet fæstet i graven rod\". It stands 14 m high and is the largest stained glass window in all of Denmark. Three scenes are painted on the window: at the bottom, Christ's lying in his grave on Golgotha; next, Christ crucified, and topmost, Christ standing in golden light. The most unusual feature is the Crucifixion scene, which (for an unknown reason) shows Jesus's head falling to the left, unlike traditional scenes which always show Jesus's head falling to the right.\n\nThe cathedral has a wonderful altar piece (pictured, left) carved by the famous Lübeck sculptor and painter Bernt Notke) (c. 1440–c. 1509). It was dedicated on Easter Sunday 1479 and is one of Denmark's great treasures. The altarpiece is unusual in that it has movable sections, so different scenes may be viewed during the liturgical calendar.\nThe pulpit was carved in oak by sculptor Mikkel van Groningen and dedicated in 1588. It shows scenes from the Old and New Testaments.\nThe baptismal font was created in copper by the bell maker, Peter Hansen of Flensborg, in 1481. It was a gift of Bishop Jens Ivarsen Lange, (d. 1482) who just two years earlier had given the great altar piece to St Clements. The font stands on the heads of the four evangelists in human form, but with the heads of the animals that often symbolize the four gospels in ecclesiastic art: John is eagle-headed, Mark is lion-headed, Luke bears the head of an ox, while Matthew alone has the head of a man.\nThe font has four scenes, carved in relief, from the life of Christ and nine of the apostles (the rest of the figures cannot be identified). The scenes are the Baptism, the Crucifixion, Christ on Judgement Day, and Mary's heavenly coronation.\n\nFor the first hundred years the font was open and the priest dipped the child three times; later there were added a brass top and a silver tray used for the baptism of children, which is now over 300 years old.\n\nThe \"Golden Door\" is one of five wrought iron gates that separate the nave from the choir, a reminder of the separation between the clergy and public in Catholic times. The gates were made by German-born artist Caspar Fincke (1584-1655) .\n\nIn the huge bell tower hang eight bells. In 1642 lightning struck the tower and set it ablaze and damaged some of the bells. The oldest (dating from the mid-13th century is the \"Martinus\"; \"pl\" is cast in 1493, Per Tidichsøn's bell is of 1505, Caspar Kønig's is cast in 1746, the M. C. Troschell bell is cast in 1762, and a pair of L. Andersen's bells are from 1893, and lastly came the 1894 S. Frichs bell.\n\nAs is the custom in many parts of Denmark, a ship hangs at the crossing as a reminder of those lost at sea and of Denmark's close connection to the sea (pictured, left). The cathedral's ship (dated 1720) is named \"Enigheden\" (lit. English \"Unity\") and it might have been built in Holland: the Russian tsar Peter the Great ordered war ships from ship builders in Holland; instead of sketches, he was offered a model of the upcoming ship, which was sent by sea to Russia. A storm sank the transport by Skagen, and the model made it to shore almost intact. Some fishermen from Aarhus bought the model, and subsequently offered it as a votive gift to the Aarhus Domkirke.\n\nWith the model ship's length of 2.65 m and height of 3.50 m, it is the largest church ship in any Danish church, and it is thought of as a symbol of man's sail from cradle to grave.\n\nThe crypt of the cathedral houses the remains of thousands of people of all ranks.\nThe church has several chapels and tombs (in both Romanesque and Baroque styles), and a number of memorials. The most striking is the Marselis Chapel, built for the Marselis family by the Flemish baroque sculptor Thomas Quellinus (1661-c.1710); the chapel's high Baroque memorial is the largest of its kind in Denmark, and beneath the floor is the family burial vault.\nThe main pipe organ was built by the organ builder Lambert Daniel Kastens (c. 1690-1744) in 1730. He was a student of one of Europe's best-known organ makers, Arp Schnitger (1648–1719) of Hamburg. It has been restored, enlarged, and updated several times, but the baroque facade has been maintained. The majority of voices in the current organ are built by the organ builders Th. Frobenius & Sons between 1928 and 2001. With 89 voices it is now Denmark's largest church organ. In 1885, pianist, composer and conductor Robert William Otto Allen (1852–1888) became the organist.\n\nManual compass = C–c, Pedal compass = C–g.\n\nList of Churches in Aarhus\n"}

It is located in Region F of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, and is one of five tourism developments aimed at inner-city regeneration.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the Newtown Precinct was known as \"the Brickfields\". This area was rich in clay, and brick making became the most popular form of generating income. By 1896, about 7,000 people of all races lived in the area, later named Burghersdorp.\n\nAs this land was close to the centre of Johannesburg and the railway line, many businesses and immigrants coming from overseas bought stands in Burghersdorp. Soon, trading companies, banks, brick companies, a brewery, and fisheries moved into the area. \n\nIn April 1904, the fire brigade set the area alight destroying everything in the inferno - a measure allegedly to combat the bubonic plague that had broken out. The area was surveyed, re-planned in unbecoming haste and renamed Newtown by October 1904, a commercial area where vast fortunes in milling, production of sugar and food merchandising would be made.\n\nAs with major cities in some regions of the world, Johannesburg's city centre has been through a period of stagnation and degeneration. However, in the past few years a number of initiatives have been adopted to reverse these trends. One of the most important of these is the Greater Newtown Development.\n\nThe establishment of a City Improvement District, the installation of closed-circuit television, the upgrading of existing buildings and public open spaces have turned Newtown into a safe, secure and attractive environment. Mary Fitzgerald Square regularly hosts public performances and gatherings. With lighting designed by renowned French lighting designer, Patrick Rimoux, Newtown has been transformed into a well-lit, attractive destination.\n\nIn partnership with Gauteng Agency Blue IQ, the Johannesburg City Council - through the Johannesburg Development Agency - is transforming Newtown into a safe and attractive place to work, live and visit. The project entails several improvements of the area, all aimed at enchancing Newtown and making it viable. These include five housing developments catering for different income levels. \n\nOver 2,000 housing units will be built over the next three years. This destination has been made accessible through the construction of the Nelson Mandela Bridge and associated M1/Carr Street interchange. The Nelson Mandela Bridge opened on 20 July 2003 and has become the new gateway from the north into Newtown.\n\nLocated in the western sector of the Johannesburg city centre, Newtown covers an area that stretches from the marshalling yards and railway lines to the north, the M2 motorway in the south, West Street in the east and Quinn Street in the west. \n\nThis destination is now easier to reach with the construction of the Nelson Mandela Bridge and associated M1 highway / Carr Street interchange, co-funded by Blue IQ, the City of Johannesburg, National Roads Agency and the National Department of Transport.\n\nNewtown has now become synonymous with the heritage and culture of South Africa and especially Johannesburg.\n\nNewtown has become one of the busiest areas since they build a shopping mall, Newtown_Junction which have a lot of customers.\n\nLillian Ngoyi(Bree) Street is always busy on a daily basis. With the Factory shops, (Manufacturing and Distribution) shops in Bree Street, Newtown that area has become the busiest place in Newtown.\n"}

In conjunction with a client access device (usually a thin client) on a user's desk, the supporting blade PC is typically housed in a rack enclosure, usually in a datacenter or specialised environment. Together, they accomplish many of the same functions of a traditional PC, but they also take advantage of many of the architectural achievements pioneered by blade servers.\n\nLike a traditional PC, a blade PC has a CPU, RAM and a hard drive. It may or may not have an integrated graphics sub-system. Some can support multiple hard drives. It is in a “blade” form that plugs into an enclosure. Enclosures offered by current blade PC vendors are similar but not identical. Most have moved the power supplies, cooling fans and some management capabilities from the blade PC to the enclosure. Up to 14 enclosures can be placed in one industry standard 42U rack.\n\nBlade PCs support one or more common operating systems (for instance Microsoft has created a “blade PC” version of their XP and Vista Business operating systems and many Linux distributions are installable). Importantly, these solutions are intended to support one user per discrete device. This is a major difference from server-based computing, which supports multiple users simultaneously using an application hosted on one discrete server (be it a discrete piece of hardware or a discrete virtual machine on a server).\n\nAccess to the device is usually achieved via various Virtual Network Computing (VNC), which allows users to log on to the blade PC via a client device (usually a thin client). Once logged on the end user experience is largely the same as if they were logged on to a local PC. It is less effective at delivering multimedia, in part because the audio and video are not synchronized, so in circumstances where there is increasing latency, there is a proportional decrease in the quality of the end user experience. All protocols are negatively impacted by increasing latency between the end user’s access device and the blade PC. One of the biggest challenges the blade PC vendors have experienced is how to minimize the impact of latency and deliver an end user experience comparable to that offered by a traditional PC, and there has been a number of new entrants in this sub-category of the blade PC in 2007. \n\nInternational Data Corporation recognizes blade PCs as a category separate from other types of PCs and has begun issuing forecasts for blade PCs.\n\nClearCube, a small privately held company based in Austin, Texas, gets credit for creating and popularizing the category. Started in the late 1990s, they have been very aggressive promoting the concept especially in the United States and in vertical markets such as financial traders, hospitals and national defense organizations.\n\nHP was second to the category with the 2004 announcement of their “Consolidated Client Infrastructure” in North America. In contrast to ClearCube, HP emphasized density while minimizing power consumption, which resulted in the ability to put far more blade PCs in an industry standard 42U rack (up to 280). HP’s first offering, however, was a Transmeta-based solution, which offered only a marginal end user experience. HP has since migrated to AMD-based blade PCs. Like the other blade PC vendors, HP offers MS RDP with their solutions, and they have announced availability of another protocol called Remote Graphics Software that has some advantages over MS RDP, especially in regard to delivery of three-dimensional and streaming content. \n\nHitachi offers a blade PC of their own in Japan. It is reportedly only available in Japan. There does not seem to have been any enhancements since it was first introduced in 2005. Though more like the CCI solution than the ClearCube solution, it is less dense and has all cabling out of the front of the unit.\n\nCommon value proposition of blade PCs relative to traditional PCs:\n\n\nAs an alternative to traditional PCs, the blade PC solutions offered by the various vendors are effectively competing with PCs, albeit they are based in datacenters.

On 27 January 1942, the Malay Location Standholders and Traders Association requested the name of the township be changed to Pageview after Johannesburg Mayor J.J Page. The town was renamed on 23 February 1943 and the council asked the government to give the Indian land owners ownership of their land. In 1948, the National Party won the election and would soon introduce Apartheid. The area would be declared a white area which meant the eviction of all non-white residents, with black residents going to Soweto and Indian residents to Lenasia with evictions continuing from 1964 to 1970. Many homes were bulldozed, and housing for white people was built on some of the land, with large parts remaining undeveloped. This heritage is now commemorated at the Fietas Museum The Oriental Plaza, a shopping centre, was built by the Johannesburg City Council to compensate the traders who lost the shops during the forced removals.\n\n"}

In 1993, she moved to Toronto, Canada to join her parents where she completed high school.\n\nYoung's early career included the role of “Crystal” on the Frances-Anne Solomon produced sitcom \"Lord Have Mercy!\" (2003), theatre work with Black Theatre Workshop and Theatre Passe Muraille, and artist residencies with Soulpepper Theatre, CanadianStage, Obsidian Theatre, and Banff Centre for the Arts. In 2001, her breakout role as “Stacyanne” came through \"Da Kink in My Hair\", by Jamaican-Canadian writer Trey Anthony.\n\nYoung's works, \"The Sankofa Trilogy\", \"The Orisha Trilogy\" and \"The Ibeji Trilogy\", explore the psychological and ideological impacts of colonization to capitalism on people of African descent, from a Black Feminist perspective. They are triptych dramas.\n\n\"The Sankofa Trilogy\" are the stories of three Jamaican women, Mudgu Sankofa, her daughter Sekesu, and her granddaughter Benu. Each play uses the women's familial bond to tell of their respective journeys of revolutionary self-determination, and transformative self-expression. \"The Orisha Trilogy\"\"\" is a series about the experiences of women characters of the past, present, and future who survived the transatlantic slave trade. In each time period, the women grapple with power, gender, and sexuality through oppression and social unrest, under the help and protection of the Orishas .\"The Ibeji Trilogy\" are three biomyth dramas about Black love as it evolves in the midst of major life changes, from friendship to romance, between mother and son, and deep self-love.\n\nYoung established Spolrusie Publishing, a publishing house to support the work of emerging black writers.\n\nFrom 2008-2018 she also created and ran The Watah Theatre, the only black-focused performance art school in Canada. The Watah Theatre offered tuition-free professional development programs. Between The Watah Theatre and Yemoya Artist Residency, she mentored some of Canada's up and coming young black creatives and international artists of colour including Amanda Parris, Kim Katrin Milan, Titilope Sonuga, and photographer, Che Kothari.\n\nYoung's style of theatre practice developed draws from her upbringing in the performative and political environment of emerging Dub poetry in Jamaica of 1980s. She uses Jamaican language and idiom as nation language, as opposed to colloquialism. She works extensively with monodrama and biomythography, or “biomyth monodrama.”\n\nYoung's work recognizes the connections between identity and community as both inextricable and sacred. The Anitafrika Method initiates self-recovery through a creative process of performance that grounds broader notions of identity, community, social constructs, and metaphysical concepts, and focuses them into an embodied performance experience. She has applied the method in a variety of disciplines and with practitioners in health care, social justice, art, and leadership development.\n\nFrom January to June 2015, Young applied the method in a special collaboration with the Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada: The Black Womxn's Health Research Project.\n\nIn 2018 Young began work in postgraduate studies in the Praxes, Politics and Pedagogies of Black Performance at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\nYoung is a mother to two sons.\n\n\n"}

The main road through the suburb is \"Albertina Sisulu\", has its eastern end in the suburb and connects the CBD to Johannesburg's eastern suburbs and towns of the East Rand. It is located in Region F of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality.\n\nTroyeville was founded as the gold rush happened and people tried to build homes and churches away from the centre of mining. The suburb was founded on one of the original farms on the Witwatersrand, after a strip of land was sold from the farm \"Doornfontein\". The land was purchased by Hollanders, Van Boeschoten and Lorentz. Their land was surveyed by Gustav Arthur Troye and is named after this surveyor. The survey did not take into count the contours of the land and hence there are steep slopes in the suburb. The street names all have Netherlands origins. During 1895, the plots of land were being sold for an average price of £30. Mohandas Gandhi lived in Troyeville from a period between 1904 and 1906, with the house still in existence at 11 Albermarle Street.\n\nThe oldest Baptist church in South Africa is in Troyeville dating from 1897 when it was started by missionaries. An anti-apartheid activist David Webster lived on Eleanor Street at what is now called the David Webster House.

He belonged to the house of Amboise, a noble family possessed of considerable influence: of his nine brothers, four were bishops. His father, Pierre d'Amboise, seigneur de Chaumont, was chamberlain to Charles VII and Louis XI and ambassador at Rome. Georges' eldest brother, Charles, was governor of the Île-de-France, Champagne and Burgundy, and councillor of Louis XI.\n\nGeorges d'Amboise was born at the family castle in Chaumont-sur-Loire.\n\nHe was only fourteen when his father procured for him the bishopric of Montauban, and Louis XI appointed him one of his almoners. On arriving at manhood d'Amboise attached himself to the party of Louis, duc d'Orléans, in whose cause he suffered imprisonment at Corbeil, and on whose return to the royal favor he was elevated to the archbishopric of Narbonne, (June 18, 1482) in which the pope refused to confirm him; after some time he changed his see for that of Rouen (1493). On the appointment of Orléans as governor of Normandy, d'Amboise became his lieutenant-general.\n\nIn 1498 the duc d'Orléans mounted the throne as Louis XII, and d'Amboise was suddenly raised to the high position of cardinal (September 17, 1498) and prime minister. In December 1498, he obtained, for reasons of state, the annulment of the marriage of the king to Jeanne de Valois; the king married Anne de Bretagne, widow of the king, in January 1499.\n\nHis foreign policy was animated by the aim of increasing French power in Italy by the conquest of the Milanese territories, in which he can be seen as the continuator of the policies of Étienne de Vesc. On 9 February 1499, he signed a treaty with Venice to which Pope Alexander VI adhered. He accompanied Louis and entered with him into Milan 6 October 1499; he was charged with organizing that province under French control, then returned to France in November. After the revolt of March 1500 in favor of Ludovico Sforza, the cardinal was appointed lieutenant general; he retook the duchy of Milan and sent Sforza to France as a prisoner. He made a triumphal entrance into Lyon on 23 June and received from Louis XII the countship of Lomello. The Cardinal returned to Italy at the beginning of 1501 for the attempted conquest of Naples; he went to Trent as ambassador in October 1501. \n\nHis administration in France was, in many respects, well-intentioned and useful. Having the good fortune to serve a king who was both economical and just, he was able to diminish the imposts, to introduce order among the soldiery, and above all, by the ordinances of 1499, to improve the organization of justice. He was also zealous for the reform of the church, and particularly for the reform of the monasteries; and it is greatly to his credit that he did not avail himself of the extremely favorable opportunities he possessed of becoming a pluralist.\n\nHe regularly spent a large income in charity, and he labored strenuously to stay the progress of the plague and famine which broke out in 1504.\n\nThe \"Butter Tower\" of Rouen Cathedral was erected in the early 16th century. d'Amboise had authorised the burning of butter instead of oil, which was scarce, in lamps during Lent, collecting monies of \"six deniers Tournois\" from each diocesan for this permission.\n\nOn the death of Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503) he aspired to the papacy during the papal conclave, September 1503. He had French troops at the gates of Rome, by means of which he could easily have frightened the conclave and induced them to elect him; but he was persuaded to trust to his influence; the troops were dismissed, and an Italian was appointed as Pius III (1503); and again, on the death of Pius within the month, another Italian, Julius II (1503–13), was chosen.\n\nCardinal d'Amboise received as compensation the title of papal legate for life in France and in the Comtat Venaissin.\n\nHe was one of the negotiators of the disastrous Treaty of Blois (1504), and in 1508 of the League of Cambrai against Venice. In 1509 he again accompanied Louis XII into Italy, but on his return he was seized at the city of Lyon with a fatal attack of gout in the stomach. He died there on the 25th of May 1510. His body was removed to Rouen; and a magnificent tomb, on which he is represented kneeling in the attitude of prayer, was erected to his memory in the cathedral of that town. Throughout his life he was an enlightened patron of letters and art, and it was at his orders that the Château de Gaillon near Rouen was built.\n\nThe town of Amboise owes much of its importance to the renown of Georges d'Amboise, whose forebears, however, forfeited the château whence they derived their name.\n\nHis nephews Louis d'Amboise, Georges II d'Amboise and François Guillaume de Castelanu de Clermont-Ludéve were also made cardinals.\n\nHis capacity as an administrator was such that he is believed to be the original \"Georges\" of the now-obsolete catchphrase \"Laissez faire à Georges\" (English: \"Let George do it\") The idiom apparently first appears in French in the mid-17th century, but its relationship to the 20th century American saying \"Let George do it\" is most likely coincidental.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250401", "title": "Humanistic Buddhism", "text": "Humanistic Buddhism\n\nHumanistic Buddhism () is a modern philosophy practiced by Buddhist groups originating from Chinese Buddhism which places an emphasis on integrating Buddhist practices into everyday life and shifting the focus of ritual from the dead to the living.\n\nTaixu, a Buddhist modernist activist and thinker who advocated the reform and renewal of Chinese Buddhism, used the term Buddhism for Human Life (). The first two characters, \"human\" and \"life\", indicating his criticism of several aspects of late Qing dynasty and early Republican Chinese Buddhism that he wished to correct, namely, an emphasis on spirits and ghosts (\"human\") and funeral services and rites (\"life\"). His disciples continued this emphasis.\n\nTaixu also used the term Buddhism for the Human World, or popularly humanistic Buddhism (). It appears that at first the two terms were largely interchangeable. One of Taixu's disciples, Yin Shun, used the term humanistic Buddhism to indicate a criticism against the \"deification\" of Buddhism, which was another common feature of much of Chinese Buddhism, in his articles and books. It was Yin Shun and other disciples of Taixu who brought both of these two terms to Taiwan in the wake of the Republicans' defeat during the civil war against the Communist Party of China. It was in Taiwan that the term humanistic Buddhism became the most commonly used term, particularly amongst the religious leaders who originally hailed from China.\n\nTemple Nan Tien outlines the principles of humanistic Buddhism as integrating Buddhist practices into everyday life based on the nature of Sakyamuni Buddha achieving Buddhahood while bound in an earthly form. Humanistic Buddhism is based on six core concepts, namely humanism, altruism, spiritual practices as part of daily life, joyfulness, timeliness and the universality of saving all beings. From these principles, the aim of humanistic Buddhism is to reconnect Buddhist practice with the ordinary and places emphasis on caring for the material world, not solely concerned with achieving delivery from it.\n\nAccording to Daisaku Ikeda, head of the Soka Gakkai new religious movement: Another aspect of manifesting the teaching of Humanistic Buddhism is the interfaith dialogue and the study of the common tenets of non-violence.\n\nSoka Gakkai International teaches that “the Lotus Sutra ... leads all people to Buddhahood and we ordinary human beings are in no way different or separate from one another\" and viewed the Buddha as a role model for all humanity: \"The purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha, the lord of teachings, lies in his behaviour as a human being\".\n\nYin Shun was the key figure in the doctrinal exposition of Buddhism and thus humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan. However, he was not particularly active in the social or political spheres of life. This was to be carried out by a younger generation such as Hsing Yun, Sheng-yen, Wei Chueh and Cheng Yen. These four figures, collectively known as the Four Heavenly Kings of Taiwanese Buddhism, head the Four Great Mountains, or monasteries, of Taiwanese Buddhism and Buddhist new religious movements, namely Fo Guang Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, Chung Tai Shan and Tzu Chi.\n\nHumanistic Buddhism originated in China at the beginning of the 20th century. The movement emerged as a collective attempt to emphasize the importance of serving the living in Buddhist practice, rather than placing focus on the traditional Buddhist rituals for the dead. After the Ming dynasty, penance for the dead had become more widespread, replacing rituals focused on meditation. A possible cause for this was Emperor Zhu Yuanzhan's Buddhist Orders issued in 1391. These created three categories of the sangha, or monastic class: meditation monks, teaching monks and yoga monks. These yoga monks were responsible for performing rituals for the dead. This led to certain monks taking on the roles of monks on call who performed rituals to earn their livelihood. These monks on call made up a majority of the sangha by the end of the Qing dynasty. Another possible cause of the increased rituals for the dead was the spread of tantric Buddhism following the Yuan dynasty which promoted ritual practice.\n\nFo Guang Shan is one of the most popular humanistic Buddhist organizations in present-day Taiwan. They have done work to reform and re-invent more traditional ritual practices. They strive to highlight Dharmic aspects of ritual and tailor their practices and worship to benefit the living, rather than the dead. Fo Guang Shan are known for their Recitation Teams, which they send to hospitals and hospice care facilities to assist the dying and their loved ones in performing humanistic Buddhist ritual practice. Humanistic Buddhists believe that death is not an end so much as the beginning of a new life and therefore rituals at the end of life should comfort and pacify the dying individual. They also hold ceremonies that celebrate marriage and the happiness of married couples which are popular worldwide.\n\nMaster Hsing Yun, born in 1927, is a leader in the humanistic Buddhist movement in Taiwan and was the founder of Fo Guang Shan in the 1960s. He wrote \"Rites for Funerals\", a work outlining the Dharmic elements of these rituals and reforming them to place emphasis on the living participants and worshipers. He also wrote \"The Etiquettes and Rules\", which outlines the practices of traditional Buddhism from a humanistic perspective.\n\nOne controversy of humanistic Buddhism is the role of women in society. Master Hsing Yun, the founder of the Fo Guang Shan humanistic Buddhist movement, holds a conservative perspective as to the position of women and has published a variety of articles for men on how to maintain a functioning household and for women on how to provide proper companionship and please their husbands. Despite this perception, women have earned themselves a solid position in the Chinese workforce. While Master Hsing Yun does not advocate for women being forced out of workplaces, he cautions men about the problems that might arise in a household if a woman is not at home to keep things in order. However, Buddhist nuns have been gaining a place as of 1998 in which 136 women from a variety of Buddhist traditions were ordained into the Fo Guang Shan tradition in China. Taiwan has also had ordination available to Buddhist nuns for centuries.\n\nAs did Nichiren, on whose reform of Buddhism the Soka Movement was founded, the Soka Gakkai International upholds the principle of fundamental equality of men and women, clergy and laity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250414", "title": "Railroad Commission of Texas", "text": "Railroad Commission of Texas\n\nThe Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC; also sometimes called the \"Texas Railroad Commission\", \"TRC\") is the state agency that regulates the oil and gas industry, gas utilities, pipeline safety, safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry, and surface coal and uranium mining. Despite its name, it ceased regulating railroads in 2005.\n\nEstablished by the Texas Legislature in 1891, it is the state's oldest regulatory agency and began as part of the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. From the 1930s to the 1960s it largely set world oil prices, but was displaced by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) after 1973. In 1984, the federal government took over transportation regulation for railroads, trucking and buses, but the Railroad Commission kept its name. With an annual budget of $79 million, it now focuses entirely on oil, gas, mining, propane, and pipelines, setting allocations for production each month.\n\nThe three-member commission was initially appointed by the governor, but an amendment to the state's constitution in 1894 established the commissioners as elected officials who serve overlapping six-year terms, like the sequence in the U.S. Senate, elected statewide. No specific seat is designated as chairman; the commissioners choose the chairman from among themselves. Normally the commissioner who faces reelection is the chairman for the preceding two years. The current commissioners are Wayne Christian since January 9, 2017, Ryan Sitton since January 5, 2015, and Christi Craddick since December 17, 2012.\n\nAttempts to establish a railroad commission in Texas began in 1876. After five legislative failures, an amendment to the state constitution providing for a railroad commission was submitted to voters in 1890. The amendment's ratification and the 1890 election of Governor James S. Hogg, a liberal Democrat, permitted the legislature in 1894 to create the Railroad Commission, giving it jurisdiction over operations of railroads, terminals, wharves, and express companies. It could set rates, issue rules on how to classify freight, require adequate railroad reports, and prohibit and punish discrimination and extortion by corporations. George Clark, running as an independent \"Jeffersonian Democratic\" candidate for governor in 1892, denounced the TRE as, \"Wrong in principle, undemocratic, and unrepublican Commissions do no good. They do harm. Their only function is to harass. I regard it as essentially foolish and essentially vicious.\" Clark lost the 1892 election to Hogg but a federal judge ruled the TRC illegal; the judge in turn was overruled by the United States Supreme Court. The governor appointed the first members; the first elections to the commission were held in 1893, with three commissioners serving six-year, overlapping terms. The TRC did not have jurisdiction over interstate rates, but Texas was so large that the in-state traffic it regulated was of dominant importance.\n\nJohn H. Reagan (1818–1903), the first head of the TRC (1891–1903), had been the most outspoken advocate in Congress of bills to regulate railroads in the 1880s. He feared the corruption caused by railroad monopolies and considered their control a moral challenge. As chairman of the TRC, he changed his views when he became acquainted with the realities of the complex forces affecting railroad management. Reagan turned to the Efficiency Movement for ideas, establishing a pattern of regulatory practice that TRC used for decades. He believed that the agency should pursue two main goals: to protect consumers from unfair railway practices and excessive rates, and to support the state's overall economic growth. To find the optimal rates that met these goals he focused the TRC on the collection of data, direct negotiation with railway executives, and compromises with the parties involved. The agency did not have the legal authority to set rates, nor did it have the resources to spend much of its time in court battles. The carrot was far more important than the stick. Freight rates continued to decline dramatically. In 1891, a typical rate was 1.403 cents per ton mile. By 1907 the rate was 1.039 cents – a decline of 25%. However the railroads did not have rates high enough for them to upgrade their equipment and lower costs in the face of competition from pipelines, cars and trucks, and the Texas railway system began a slow decline.\n\nFrom the 1890s through the 1960s, the Texas Railroad Commission found it difficult to enforce fully Jim Crow segregation legislation. Because of the expense involved, Texas railroads often allowed wealthier blacks to mix with whites, rather than provide separate cars, dining facilities, and even depots. In addition, West Texas authorities often refused to enforce Jim Crow laws because few African Americans resided there. In the 1940s, the railroad commission's enforcement of segregation laws began collapsing further, in part because of the great number of African American soldiers that were transported during World War II. The trains were integrated in the early 1960s.\n\nThe agency's reach expanded as it took over responsibility for regulating oil pipelines (in 1917), oil and gas production (1919), natural gas delivery systems (1920), bus lines (1927), and trucking (1929). It grew from 12 employees in 1916 to 69 in 1930 and 566 in 1939. It does not have jurisdiction over investor owned utility companies; that falls under the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\nA crisis for the petroleum industry was created by the East Texas oil boom of the 1930s, as prices plunged to 25 cents a barrel. The traditional TRC policy of negotiating compromises failed; the governor was forced to call in the state militia to enforce order. Texas oilmen decided they preferred state to federal regulation, and wanted the TRC to give out quotas so that every producer would get higher prices and profits. Pure Oil Company opposed the first statewide oil prorationing order, which was issued by the TRC in August 1930. The order, which was intended to conserve oil resources by limiting the number of barrels drilled per day, was seen by small producers like Pure as a conspiracy between government and major companies to drive them out of business and foster monopoly in the oil industry.\n\nErnest O. Thompson (1892–1966), head of the TRC from 1932 to 1965, took charge of the agency and indeed the oil industry by appealing to an ideal of Texas's role in the global oil order—the civil religion of Texas oil. He cajoled, harangued, and browbeat recalcitrant producers into compliance with the TRC's prorationing orders. The New Deal allowed the TRC to set national oil policy. As late as the 1950s the TRC controlled over 40% of United States crude production and approximately half of estimated national proved reserves. It served as a model in the creation of OPEC. Gordon M. Griffin, chief engineer of the TRC during World War II, developed the formula for prorationing to keep production flowing for the military.\n\nBecause it needed access to the Texas headquarters of the various oil companies, it became a long term tenant at the Milam Building.\n\nRegulation was a practical rather than ideological affair. The TRC typically worked with the regulated industries to improve operations, share best practices, and address consumer complaints. Radical activities like rate setting to favor shippers or producers or consumers, and heated court battles, were the exception rather than the rule.\n\nWithin the oil and gas industry, it took into account production in other states, in effect bringing total available supply, (including imports, which were small) within the principle of prorationing to market demand. Allowable oilfield production was calculated as follows: estimated market demand, minus uncontrolled additions to supply, gave the Texas total; this was then prorated among fields and wells in a manner calculated to preserve equity among producers, and to prevent any well from producing beyond its maximum efficient rate (MER). Scheduled allowables are expressed in numbers of calendar days of permitted production per month at MER. In the spring of 2013, new hydraulic fracturing water recycling rules were adopted in the state of Texas by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The Water Recycling Rules are intended to encourage Texas hydraulic fracturing operators to conserve water used in the hydraulic fracturing process for oil and gas wells.\n\nAs of June 2019, the commission members are Wayne Christian (chairman), Ryan Sitton, and Christi Craddick. All three members are Republicans.Christian was elected in 2016 as a commissioner and a chairman in 2019. Sitton was elected in 2014 and Craddick was elected in 2012 and reelected in 2018.\n\nEffective October 1, 2005, as a result of House Bill 2702 the rail oversight functions of the Railroad Commission were transferred to the Texas Department of Transportation. The traditional name of the commission was not changed despite the loss of its titular regulatory duties.\n\nThe Shreveport Rate Case, also known as \"Houston E. & W. Ry. Co. v. United States\", 234 U.S. 342 (1914) arose from the Railroad Commission's setting railroad freight rates unequally. Because of the low intrastate rates, shippers in eastern Texas tended to ship their wares to Dallas (in Texas), rather than to Shreveport, Louisiana, although Shreveport was considerably closer to much of eastern Texas. The Railroad Commission's (and the railroad's) position was that only the state could regulate commerce within a state, and that the federal government had no power so to do. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government's ability to regulate interstate commerce necessarily included the ability to regulate intrastate \"operations in all matters having a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic\" and to ensure that \"interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms\".\n\nThe Railroad Commission has also figured prominently in two major U.S. Supreme Court cases on the doctrine of abstention:\n\nThe agency is headquartered in the William B. Travis State Office Building at 1701 North Congress Avenue in Austin. In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission has twelve oil and gas district offices located throughout the state. The district offices facilitate communication between industry representatives and the Commission.\n\n\n"}

The reserve is situated on the southern shores of Botany Bay at , within the Sutherland Shire. The reserve is protected under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance as an important breeding ground for many vulnerable, protected, or endangered species. The Towra Point Aquatic Nature Reserve is located in the surrounding waterways.\n\n<mapframe text=\"A geoshape of Towra Point Nature Reserve\" width=300 height=300 zoom=12 latitude=-34.0200 longitude=151.1738>\n</mapframe>\nKurnell was inhabited by the Dharawal people, and there are three middens and one relic that still remain today at the Towra Point Nature Reserve.\n\nCaptain Cook mapped Botany Bay when he landed in 1770, including Towra Point. Early European colonialists ran horses and cattle on Towra Point, despite the poor condition of the land for such a purpose. In 1827, \"Towra Point\" and \"Towra Bay\" were recorded as local names by the surveyor Robert Dixon. Another name known for the area was \"Stinkpot Bay\". In 1861, Thomas Holt bought Towra Point, and divided it into paddocks for grazing or growing corn. Sheep grazing was particularly disastrous, and many thousands of sheep died of footrot and are buried at Towra Point. In the late 1870s, Thomas Holt began oyster farming at Weeney Bay in Towra Point. In 1935, the Parks and Playgrounds Movement of NSW opposed an application to mine for shell at Towra Point. During World War II, a radar station was established, and a causeway built. In 1946, Towra Point was considered as a location for a second Sydney airport.\n\nIn the 1960s, movement began to preserve Towra Point led initially by the President of Sutherland Shire, Arthur Gietzelt, and Tom Uren, the then Federal Minister for Urban Affairs. In 1965 Ian Griffith, state MP for Cronulla, praised the idea, but was met by community backlash. In March 1969, the then Prime Minister, John Gorton ruled out Towra Point as a potential site for a second airport, citing community noise problems. The opening to Botany Bay was dredged in the 1970s to assist shipping, but this refracted the wave patterns in the bay, focusing them on Towra Point, causing erosion. The building of the revetment wall in Port Botany was also thought to contribute to the changed wave patterns. In 1974 and 1975, the waves off Towra were so strong that teens surfed there.\n\nFollowing lobbying by Ray Thorburn, the reserve was bought by the Commonwealth in 1975, attempting to fulfill obligations to JAMBA, which would come into force in April 1981. This was the first time that the Australian Government had bought land for nature conservation purposes within a state. On 10 September 1979 the oil tanker \"World Encouragement\" spilled approximately of crude oil into Botany Bay. Mangroves at Quibray Bay, Weeney Bay and Towra Point were impacted – of mangroves were affected, and died.\n\nIn 1981, another oil spill occurred at the Matraville refinery, causing more damage to the mangroves. In 1982, Towra Point was officially made a nature reserve. In 1983 Towra was suffering from erosion – the Elephant's Trunk, a peninsula of Towra had shrunk to 3 metres wide. The seagrasses were also being eaten by sea-urchins – the population had exploded from 20,000 per hectare in 1979 to 80,000 by 1983. It was declared a Ramsar site (or wetland of international importance) in 1984, at the time meeting Ramsar criteria 1, 2, 3 and 6. In 2009, Towra Point met Ramsar criteria 2, 3, 4 and 8. In 1987, the Towra Point Aquatic Nature Reserve was created, covering in the waterways surrounding Towra Point. Towra Point Nature Reserve also attempts to meet the Federal government's obligations to CAMBA, which came into force in 1988.\n\nIn 1990, the Elephant's Trunk was eroded so much that the tip broke off into an island. By this time, Towra Beach was so eroded that trees that were part of the forest were \"tumbling into the water\". The Friends of Towra Point volunteer group was founded in February 1997 and they do such activities as bush regeneration, seed collection, vegetation surveys and habitat creation for the little tern. They also coordinate the annual Clean Up Australia Day activities at Towra Point. Habitat creation involves sandbagging the eroding Towra Lagoon, nest tagging, and clearing areas around nests.\n\nIn 2003, it was proposed to undertake beach nourishment at Towra Point, involving 60,000 cubic metres of sand. While this had an immediate negative effect on some amphipod species, they had recovered by 2005. In January 2004, 24 little tern were killed after picnickers and a dog accidentally landed on Towra Spit Island. In 2004, a 1.5 million dredging project was undertaken to cut off Towra Spit Island from the rest of Towra Point to provide a fox-free environment. In around 2007, the La Perouse Aboriginal Community began sending trainees to work in the area for the National Parks and Wildlife Service as part of the \"Towra Team\", combining bush regeneration work with learning traditional Aboriginal cultural skills.\n\nIn 2010, artificial roosting posts were installed by the Office of Environment & Heritage to supplement the roosting habitat in the area. In the 2010 breeding season, 72 little tern fledged. In 2012, the site received a \"Grey Globe\" award of shame, given to Ramsar sites that are considered to be under threat. In 2013, the Botany Bay National Park and of land including Towra Point Nature Reserve were to be included on the State Heritage Register.\n\nTowra Point, atop an ancient river delta deposit, has many distinct habitats – these diverse habitats are part of why Towra Point is a Ramsar site. The habitats of the Reserve are:\n\nIn 2001, the mangrove forests of Towra Point were described as varying in width between tens and hundreds of metres and largely consisting of the grey mangrove \"Avicennia marina\" with the river mangrove \"Aegiceras corniculatum\" growing in patches along the edge of the forest closest to the landward edge.\n\nTowra Point Nature Reserve is home to many endangered, vulnerable, protected and exotic species. This list is from the NSW Government's Environment and Heritage department website – a comprehensive listing, including numbers, scientific names, and protection status, can be found at this link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ecosystem surrounding Towra Point has been impacted as a result of human interaction.\n\nHumans can maximise the area of healthy, functioning intertidal wetlands by minimising their impacts and by developing management strategies that protect, and where possible rehabilitate these ecosystems at risk.\n\nThe following are positive ways of trying to protect or rehabilitate intertidal wetlands.\n\n\nThe traditional objectives for the management of wetland areas were built around the use of wetland resources for food, shelter and tools. Grey Mangrove wood, for example, was used to make shields, shells were made into fishing hooks; and marine animals were used for food.\n\n\nCare has been taken to develop management plans that are both realistic and flexible. They need to take into account scientific and technological advances, changing social and political attitudes and variations in the level of funding. Management plans also need to be consistent with Australia's international obligations under JAMBA, CAMBA and RAMSAR.\n\nRamsar Convention (1971), JAMBA (1981), Bonn Convention (1983), CAMBA (1988), ROKAMBA (2006), the Partnership for the Conservation of Migratory Waterbirds and the Sustainable Use of their Habitats in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway (2006), Convention on Biological Diversity (1992).\n\nAs the Towra Point area is Ramsar listed, this attracts the operation of the federal \"Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\" and Regulations. Section 17B provides that a person is guilty of a criminal offence if (a) the person takes an action [see:s.523]; and (b) the action results or will result in a significant impact on the ecological character of a wetland; and (c) the wetland is a declared Ramsar wetland. Towra Point Nature Reserve is listed a component of Littoral Rainforest and Coastal Vine Thickets of Eastern Australia, a critically endangered Ecological community under the EPBC Act.\n\nIn addition to land use planning law, the following Acts are applicable \"National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974\" (NSW), \"Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979\" (NSW), \"Fisheries Management Act 1994\" (NSW), \"Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995\" (NSW) and applicable SEPPs (e.g. State Environmental Planning Policy No 39—Spit Island Bird Habitat). Following a review, several SEPPs were repealed in favour of using Local Environmental Plans.\n\nTowra Point Nature Reserve has been listed as being part of the Coastal Dune Littoral Rainforest ecological community, an endangered ecological community under the TSC Act.\n\n\n"}

The river itself is the border between the Annapolis and Digby counties of Nova Scotia and thus, splits the village so that half the village is in Annapolis County and the other half in Digby County. \nThe village is adjacent to the Bear River First Nation which administers the Bear River 6, 6A and 6B reserves.\n\nOriginally inhabited by the Mi'kmaq, the area was called \"Eelsetkook\", meaning \"flowing along by high rocks.\" It was previously called \"St. Anthony\". It was also named \"Imbert\", after Simon Imbert, a Frenchman who commanded a relief ship for Port Royal in 1612. The name \"Imbert\" was gradually corrupted to \"Bear\". It is also occasionally referred to on maps as \"Hillsburgh\". This term is believed to be another corruption of \"Imbert\" or \"Hebert\", after Louis Hebert, an apothecary who accompanied Samuel de Champlain in 1604.\n\nBear River was an important shipbuilding location in the late 19th century. One of many large vessels built in the village was the brigantine \"Dei Gratia\", the vessel which discovered the famous mystery ship \"Mary Celeste\" in 1872. The climate and soil conditions in the Bear River area are conducive to the growing of grapes and several vineyards have emerged. Bear River was home to the first solar aquatics waste water management facility in North America; the facility ceased to function when the Municipality of the District of Digby re-routed waste water to the Smith's Cove treatment facility. After a few years of disuse, the community has made it into a community greenhouse. The community is known for its thriving artistic community, the largest per capita in Nova Scotia. There are many artist studios, shops and galleries in the downtown and immediate area. Crafts produced include clothing, woodwork, pottery, quilts, fabric arts, and an assortment of painted media.\n\nThe village is run by volunteers as there is no town government. The Bear River Board of Trade is the primary organization to pursue economic development and also maintains the waterfront park and Visitor Information Center. The Bear River Historical Society operates the Bear River Heritage Museum which is open through the summer and early fall with displays of historical photos, archival materials and artifacts of the rich history of the area. The Digby County Exhibition is held in Bear River each year. \n\nThe village is working to become an eco-village in its determination to remain low-tech, with no fast food, malls or box stores, and the exploration of alternative energy sources.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250488", "title": "Positional good", "text": "Positional good\n\nPositional goods are goods valued only by how they are distributed among the population, not by how many of them there are available in total as would be the case with other consumer goods. The source of greater worth of positional goods is their desirability as a status symbol, which usually results in them greatly exceeding the value of comparable goods.\n\nVarious goods have been described as positional in a given capitalist society, such as gold, real estate, diamonds and luxury goods. Generally any coveted goods, which may be in abundance, that are considered valuable or desirable in order to display or change one's social status when possessed by relatively few in a given community may be described as positional goods. What could be considered a positional good can vary widely depending on cultural or subcultural norms.\n\nMore formally in economics, positional goods are a subset of economic goods whose consumption (and subsequent utility), also conditioned by Veblen-like pricing, depends negatively on consumption of those same goods by others. In particular, for these goods the value is at least in part (if not exclusively) a function of its ranking in desirability by others, in comparison to substitutes. The extent to which a good's value depends on such a ranking is referred to as its \"positionality\". The term was coined by Fred Hirsch, and the concept has been refined by Robert H. Frank and Ugo Pagano.\n\nThe term is sometimes extended to include services and non-material possessions that may alter one's social status and that are deemed highly desirable when enjoyed by relatively few in a community, such as college degrees, achievements, awards, etc.\n\nAlthough Thorstein Veblen emphasized the importance of one's relative position in society with reference to the concept of conspicuous leisure and consumption, it was Fred Hirsch who coined the concept of the \"positional good\", in \"Social Limits to Growth\". He explained that the positional economy is composed of \"all aspects of goods, services, work positions and other social relationships that are either (1) scarce in some absolute or socially imposed sense or (2) subject to congestion and crowding through more extensive use\" (Hirsch, 1977: 27).\n\nHence, Hirsch distinguished categories of positional goods. Some depend, essentially, on their relative positions (pride of superiority, status and power); others, such as land for leisure activities or land for suburban housing, are positional merely because their total amount is fixed. However, land is valued at least in part for its absolute contribution to productivity, which does not \"derive\" from its relative ranking. Thus, some economists (such as Robert H. Frank and Ugo Pagano) include only goods (like status and power) which are valued specifically because of their relative quality.\n\nHirsch's main contribution is his assertion that positional goods are inextricably linked to social scarcity – social scarcity relates to the relative standings of different individuals and arises not from physical or natural limitations, but from social factors; for instance, the land in Inter-Provincial Montioni Park is physically scarce, while political leadership positions are socially scarce.\n\nThe broad theme of Hirsch's book was, he told \"The New York Times\", that material growth can \"no longer deliver what has long been promised for it – to make everyone middle-class\". The concept of positional good explains why, as economic growth improves overall quality of life at any particular level, doing \"better\" than how an individual's grandparents lived does not translate automatically into doing \"well\", if there are as many or more people ahead of them in the economic hierarchy. For example, if someone is the first in their family to get a college degree, they are doing better. But if they were at the bottom of their class at a weak school, they may find themselves less eligible for a job than their grandfather, who was only a high school graduate. That is, competition for positional goods is a zero-sum game: Attempts to acquire them can only benefit one player at the expense of others.\n\nIn the case of positional goods, people benefiting from a positional good do not take into account the externalities of their respective sufferers. That is, in the case of \"public ... goods, the consequences of this failure implies that an agent consuming the public good does not get paid for other people's consumption; in the case of a positional ... good, the equivalent failure implies that an agent consuming positive amounts is not charged for the negative consumption of other agent's consumption\" (Pagano 1999:71). That is, while, in the case of public goods, we have the standard underinvestment problem in their supply, because excluding individuals from externalities that have the \"same sign\" may turn out to be impossible, by contrast, in the case of positional goods, we have a problem of over-provision, because all agents may try to consume positive amounts of these goods, neglecting to consider the externality on others. For public goods, an undersupply, for positional goods, it signifies an over-supply. In other words, in positional competitions, people work harder to compete and consume more than they would under optimal conditions.\n\nSome economists, such as Robert Frank, argue that positional goods create \"externalities\" and that \"positional arms races\" can result for goods that might boost one's social status relative to others. This phenomenon, Frank argues, is clearly bad for society, and thus government can improve social welfare by imposing a high luxury tax on certain luxury goods to correct for the externality and mitigate the posited social waste.\n\nHowever, in some cases it may be less clear that such government intervention is warranted in response to these externalities. For example, in certain cases, such government actions can potentially impede improvements in living standards and innovation. Technological advance itself is possible in part because wealthy individuals are willing to be first purchasers of new and untested goods (e.g., early cellphone models in the early 1990s). There is a certain experimentation and risk that accompany luxury goods, and if they are found to be useful they may eventually be mass-produced and made affordable to the common person: one era's luxuries are another's commonplace goods. In short, the negative positional externality can be compensated by the public goods of infant industry effects and research and development.\n\nIn his response to the cited article by Kashdan and Klein, Robert Frank wrote the following: In the short run, the tax would not change the total level of spending. Rather, it would shift the composition of spending in favor of investment. Innovation is hardly confined to the consumption sector. Producers of capital goods also have strong incentives to come up with useful innovations. And with the greater aggregate investment spending caused by a consumption tax, more resources than before would be available for research and development. There is thus no reason to expect innovation to slow down, even in the short run. In the long run, which is what really counts for the point Kashdan and Klein are attempting to make, their argument collapses completely. Higher rates of investment mean a higher rate of income growth, which means that consumption along the high-savings trajectory will eventually exceed what it would have been had we remained on the low-savings trajectory. From that point forward, there would be more expenditure on innovation in both the consumption and capital goods sectors...\n\nOne early instance of positional economy comes from San Gimignano – a Tuscan medieval town that was considered the Manhattan of the Middle Ages for its towers (in the past there were about eighty towers). Towers were not built by aristocratic families to live in them, but to \"demonstrate\" to community, their power, affluence and status of each family. In this case, the owner of a tower consumed a positive level of positional good, like power, instead the family which did not own a tower or owned a lower building consumed a negative level of positional good, that is, it consumed the exposure stemming from the power of the owner. For this reason, there is a zero-sum game in the family consumptions. There is a party consuming a positive amount of positional good and at the same time there is a counterparty consuming a negative amount of such a good. The aristocratic family – owners of a tower – enjoyed the positive consumption of the positional good, namely it had a positive utility deriving from the positional good. On the contrary, the family – non-owners of a tower – suffered from the negative consumption of the positional good (the consumption of exposure to power of others), namely it had a negative utility. For this reason, there is a zero-sum game in the family utilities.\n\nTowers were not built stuck to each other; it would have reduced the construction costs because a part of walls would be shared. Instead, among towers there is a gap, but this gap is not large enough for a person to pass through; it is the size of a brick. The reason of this gap and its size is to keep costs of construction high, and to deny the positive consumption of a positional good to families which were not rich enough to build the entire edifice. For this reason, positional good is related to a higher pricing. The case of San Gimignano's towers explains three meanings of positional good, each one resting on the idea of social scarcity: 1) the first one based on a zero-sum game in the consumptions, 2) the second one based on a zero-sum game in the payoffs (utilities), and 3) the third one related to higher pricing mechanism to deny the consumption of others.\n\nThe definition centered on a zero-sum game in the consumptions is originated from contributions of Ugo Pagano: When one party's level of consumption is positive, then at least one other party's level of consumption must be negative. However while the dimension of positional good is binary, the net (utility) impact of a positional good may be positive, zero or negative. The individual utility derives from the individual preferences on the level of consumption. If reasonable conditions – positive (negative) consumptions imply positive (negative) utilities – hold, then a second kind of definition of positional goods may be formulated: Zero-sum game in the payoffs. Positional goods are goods whose utility of their consumptions is relative (negatively) to the consumption of the others.\n\nA last definition of positional good derives from the so-called \"Veblen effect\", which is witnessed whenever individuals are willing to pay higher prices for functionally equivalent goods (a significant example is the luxury goods market). The Veblen effect also implies that a sufficient decrease in price leads not to an increase in demand, but to a decrease, because the social status derived from acquiring the goods in question may fall (remember the role of gap among San Gimignano's towers). In this respect, positional goods are goods for which the satisfaction derives (at least in part) from higher pricing.\n\nThis brings us to an intriguing parallel between positional goods, such as \"luxury goods\", and what are known as \"Giffen goods\". Rae observed that in the case of \"mere luxuries\", while a halving of the price would require a doubling in the number of units purchased, in order to satisfy vanity to the same extent, a reduction of the price to a small fraction of its previous level would reduce demand to zero. Cournot also admitted that some goods \"of whim and luxury ... are only desirable on account of their rarity and of the high price which is the consequence thereof ... [i]n this case a great fall in price would almost annihilate the demand\" (cf. Schneider).\n\nPeople constantly compare themselves to their environments and care greatly about their relative positions, which influence their choices. Therefore, it could be argued that the paradigm of homo economicus should be extended, so that positional goods are included in theories of individual consumption and social concerns are considered among the basic motivations for individual economic behaviour. The triad of economic goods – private, public and positional goods – can be defined in terms of individual and total consumption. Private goods are characterized by the fact that they are consumed only by single individuals. The exclusion of others from positive amounts of consumption is impossible in the case of public goods. Instead, when some individuals consume positional goods, other individuals must be included in the consumption of related negative quantities.\n\nA pure positional good can be defined as a good of which a certain amount of positive consumption by one agent is matched by an equally negative amount of consumption by another agent. That is, in the case of positional goods, individuals' consumption levels have opposite signs. However, in the case of certain positional goods, such as Olympic medals, one may talk of new positional products created out of nothing; such products do not result in negative externalities, especially if even last place at the Olympics is viewed as prestigious enough to bring positive utility to the competitor.\n\nThe distinction among private, public and positional goods brings different rules for deriving total demand. In a diagrammatic view, total demand of a private good is the horizontal sum of individual demands. For a public good, instead, total demand is the Samuelsonian vertical summation of individual demands. Finally, for positional goods, the optimal level of consumption does not coincide, as it does in the case of private goods, with the intersection of any individual marginal rate of substitution curve with the marginal cost curve since an externality emerges for the consumption of other.\n\nThus, it is necessary to first calculate the total marginal rate of substitution and, consequently, find the intersection with the marginal cost curve. As in the case of public goods, the total marginal rate of substitution is calculated by the summation of individual marginal rates of substitution. But in the case of positional goods, one marginal rate of substitution is subtracted since there is negative consumption. Therefore, the total marginal rate of substitution is the difference between the two individual marginal rates of substitution.\n\n"}

It is situated on the south shore of La Grande River (the Grand River), less than from the river's mouth. Chisasibi is one of nine Cree villages in the region, and is a member of the Grand Council of the Crees of Quebec. The territory surrounding Chisasibi is part of the Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory, of which parts are jointly managed by the municipalities of the Jamésie TE and the Cree Regional Authority of the Eeyou Istchee TE.\n\nThe surface area of the town is . The surface area of associated Chisasibi Cree village municipality is .\n\nThe Cree have lived in the region for many centuries but were nomadic. In 1803, the Hudson's Bay Company founded Fort George, a trading post on the north shore which was relocated to the largest island in the mouth of La Grande River in 1837. Fort George became a permanent village as the local Cree population abandoned their nomadic way of life in the early 20th century and settled nearby. In 1940, its population was about 750 and grew to almost 2,000 in 1980.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, the construction of the James Bay hydro-electric project began, diverting upstream rivers into La Grande watershed, increasing its flow significantly, resulting in erosion of Fort George Island (also called Governor's Island) and disruption to the formation of a solid ice cover in winter. In response, the Quebec Government built a new community on the mainland's south shore, relocating the population and some 200 houses to the new site in 1981. The village was renamed Chisasibi (official name: Cree Nation of Chisasibi). At the same time, the Fort George Relocation Corporation was formed to oversee the relocation.\n\nChisasibi is the most northern Cree village accessible by road, and the northernmost community with year-round road access in eastern North America. A paved road, running from Radisson, and parallel to the Grand River, connects Chisasibi to the James Bay Road (French: \"Route de la Baie James\"). The James Bay Road (formerly part of Route 109) was built from 1971 to 1974 as part of the James Bay hydroelectric project and connects Matagami to Radisson. Chisasibi Airport is located just west of the village and Air Creebec operates scheduled service from this airport. Though this is the most northern village, this is not where the road ends. From LG-1 (La Grande-1 generating station), the road continues north to a location called Longue Pointe (Long Point). It is the farthest one can go by road east of the Hudson Bay.\n\nMany Cree in Chisasibi engage in hunting, trapping, and fishing activities but all catch is meant for local consumption. Other economic activity includes local services (health care and education), employment by Hydro-Québec and some hospitality services. An elected Chief and Council help administer the Cree Nation of Chisasibi Office.\n\nOther Cree villages near Chisasibi are Whapmagoostui, to the north in Nunavik, on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay near the Northern village of Kuujjuarapik, and Wemindji, about to the south.\n\nThe population of Chisasibi comprises approximately 4,000 Cree, about 250 Inuit, and 300 non-native people. Statistics Canada's 2011 Census shows a total population of 4,484. 2006 Census shows the median age of the population is 24.1 years old, the percentage of the population aged 15 and over is 66.2, and the total number of census families was 960.\n\nTotal private dwellings (excluding seasonal cottages): 788 (total: 885)\n\nCree and Inuit are spoken as the first language in Chisasibi, in addition to English, as a primary language for official dealings. Only 7.8% of the residents of Chisasibi speak one or both of the official languages as a mother tongue. There has been criticism of the Quebec language policy with respect to native languages, particularly Cree, many related to Hydro-Québec's hydroelectric dam project in the James Bay region.\n\nMother tongues:\n\nThe Cree School Board operates Waapinichikush Elementary School and the James Bay Eeyou School (JBES; ; ), a high school. Eeyou opened in 1980. Previously the school provided boarding services for high school students for students from other villages of the James Bay region: Eastmain, Whapmagoostui, and Wemindji as at the time all high school classes in the region were in Chisasibi. Eeyou has 398 students.\n\nChisasibi has a subarctic climate (Köppen \"Dfc\"), typical of the central latitudes of Quebec, with very cold and snowy winters and mild, rainy summers.\n\n"}

The uprising included crowds filling the streets, burning and looting local businesses, and confronting the police and national guard.\n\nThe immediate cause of the riot was the April 4 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, which triggered unrest in 125 cities across the United States. These events are sometimes described as the Holy Week Uprising.\n\nSpiro Agnew, the Governor of Maryland, called out thousands of National Guard troops and 500 Maryland State Police to quell the disturbance. When it was determined that the state forces could not control the rebellion, Agnew requested Federal troops from President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nBetween World War II and 1968, Baltimore had changed demographically. The total population remained constant, but the black percentage of the total population had grown, while other populations shrunk (a shift of 200,000 people). Black communities had sub-par housing, high rates of infant mortality, and more crime. They also suffered disproportionately from the decline in Baltimore's manufacturing sector. Black unemployment was more than double the national rate, and even higher in especially poor communities. Those who did have jobs were paid less and worked in unsafe conditions.\n\nWith the spread of civil disturbances across the nation, Maryland National Guard troops were called up for state duty on April 5, 1968, in anticipation of disturbances in Baltimore or the suburban portions of Maryland bordering Washington, DC.\n\nBlack Baltimore was quiet on April 5, despite riots in nearby Washington, D.C.. One white student at UMBC reported a quiet scene, with noticeable sadness, but little violence or unrest: April 5, \"in many cases, was just another day\".\n\nBaltimore remained peaceful into the day on April 6. Three hundred people gathered peacefully around noon for a memorial service, which lasted until 2 pm without incident. Street traffic began to increase. A crowd formed on Gay St. in East Baltimore, and by 5 pm some windows on the 400 block had been smashed. Police began to move in. People began to report fires after 6 pm. Soon after, the city declared a 10 pm curfew and called in 6,000 troops from the national guard. Sales of alcohol and firearms were immediately banned. At this point, some reports described about a thousand people in the crowd, which moved north on Gay St. up to Harford Rd. and Greenmount Ave. Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro III was unable to respond effectively. Around 8 pm, Governor Agnew declared a state of emergency.\n\nBy the morning of April 7, reports to the White House described five deaths, 300 fires, and 404 arrests. Unrest also broke out on Pennsylvania Ave in West Baltimore. At one point, a mob of white counter-rioters assembled near Patterson Park; they dispersed after National Guard troops prevented them from entering a black neighborhood.\n\nViolence decreased after April 9, and the Baltimore Orioles played their opening game the next day, though the April 12 James Brown concert remained cancelled. On the afternoon of April 9, federal troops dispersed crowds at a permitted peace rally, apparently unaware that General Gelston had issued a permit for the event. The situation was diffused by Major William \"Box\" Harris, the highest-ranking police officer in the city.\n\nWhen violent protest broke out in Baltimore on April 6, nearly the entire Maryland National Guard, both Army and Air, were called up to deal with the unrest. The notable exceptions were the state's air defense units (which manned surface-to-air missile sites around the state), those units already on duty in the Washington, DC area, and a unit positioned in Cambridge, Maryland (the site of race riots in 1963 and 1967). The Adjutant General of Maryland, Major General George M. Gelston, commanded the National Guard force and also was given control of local and state police forces in the city (approximately 1,900 police officers).\n\nThe combined National Guard and police force proved unable to contain the uprising and on Sunday, April 7, federal troops were requested. Late that evening, elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina began arriving on the scene, while several Marine units from Camp Lejeune were put on \"standby\" status. With the intervention of federal forces, the Maryland National Guard was called into federal duty, resulting in a shift from state control (reporting to the Governor of Maryland) to federal control (reporting through the Army chain of command to the President). The federal force, Task Force Baltimore, was organized into three brigades and a reserve. These were (roughly), the XVIII Airborne Corps troops, the Maryland National Guard, and troops from the 197th Infantry Brigade from Fort Benning, Georgia (which arrived two days later). The 1,300 troops of the Maryland Air National Guard were organized in a provisional battalion and used to guard critical infrastructure throughout the city, as well as an ad hoc detention facility at the Baltimore Civic Center. Task Force Baltimore peaked at 11,570 Army and National Guard troops on April 9, of which all but about 500 were committed to riot control duties.\n\nUnrest continued for several days as the Task Force sought to reassert control. Early on April 12, federal troops began to depart and by 6 pm that evening responsibility for riot control returned to the National Guard. At midnight Task Force Baltimore ceased to exist and the remainder of federal troops were withdrawn. Maryland National Guard troops remained on duty in the city until April 14, when Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew declared the emergency over and sent them home.\n\nAfter action reports credited both the National Guard and active Army forces for being extremely disciplined and restrained in dealing with the disturbance, with only four shots fired by National Guard troops and two by active Army troops. These forces had received orders to avoid firing their weapons, as part of an intentional strategy to decrease fatalities.\n\nA total of 10,956 troops had been deployed.\n\n\nIn the next few days, six people died, 700 were injured, and 5,800 were arrested. 1,000 small businesses were damaged or robbed. Property damages, assessed financially, were more severe in DC ($15 million), Baltimore ($12 million), and Chicago ($10 million) than in any other cities.\n\nIn addition, an active Army soldier died in a traffic accident while redeploying from the city. Rioters set more than 1,200 fires during the disturbance. Damage was estimated at over $12 million (equivalent to $77.5 million today).\n\nOf the arrests, 3,488 were for curfew violations, 955 for burglary, 665 for looting, 391 for assault, and 5 for arson.\n\nOne of the major outcomes of the uprising was the attention Spiro Agnew received when he criticized local black leaders for not doing enough to help stop the disturbance. These statements caught the attention of Richard Nixon, who was looking for someone on his ticket who could counter George Wallace’s American Independent Party third party campaign. Agnew became Nixon’s vice presidential running mate in 1968.\n\nThe uprising had broken out mainly in the black neighborhoods of East and West Baltimore in which extensive property damage and looting occurred. Many of the businesses destroyed in the uprising were located along the main commercial avenues of the neighborhoods and were often owned by people of a Jewish background.\n\nMedia and academic coverage of the events has been thin, partly because the event remains emotional for those involved.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250517", "title": "Being There (Wilco album)", "text": "Being There (Wilco album)\n\nBeing There is the second studio album by the American alternative rock band Wilco, released on October 29, 1996 by Reprise Records. Despite its release as a double album, \"Being There\" was sold at a single album price as a result of a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and the band's label Reprise Records. The album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception, in contrast to their debut album \"A.M.\" (1995). Taking its name from the 1979 film of the same name, the self-produced album featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than on \"A.M.\". This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan, their first with multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett and their last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.\n\nJeff Tweedy formed Wilco in 1994 after creative differences between Jay Farrar and Tweedy caused the breakup of Uncle Tupelo. The band entered the recording studio almost immediately afterwards to record and release \"A.M.\" in 1995, which saw disappointing sales. Jay Farrar's new band Son Volt released \"Trace\" in late 1995 to critical praise and good sales numbers. \"Trace\" also provided a college rock hit song in \"Drown\", which entered the top ten of the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, further increasing competition between the two bands.\n\nTweedy felt that Wilco was incomplete without a second guitarist due to the departure of Brian Henneman after the \"A.M.\" recording sessions. Wilco's road manager Bob Andrews helped Tweedy get in contact with Jay Bennett, a multi-instrumentalist who had been looking for a new band to join since his power pop band Titanic Love Affair had been dismissed from its record label. Bennett joined Wilco after Tweedy sent him a few Uncle Tupelo songs and a copy of \"A.M.\". Tweedy was intrigued by the fact that Bennett could play keyboards, an instrument no other Wilco member played.\n\nThe first conceptions of material for the album came during a particularly stressful time in Tweedy's life. Tweedy had recently quit smoking marijuana, attendance at Wilco concerts was dwindling, and Tweedy was trying to manage his marriage, a mortgage, and the birth of his first child. He responded to these pressures:\n\nFor \"Being There\", Tweedy wanted to blend the experiences he had making music with the ones he had listening to music. One of the first songs that Tweedy wrote was \"Misunderstood\", a song about a tortured musical artist from the point of view of a fan. The song contains several overt references to the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, including the addition of insults that Farrar used against Tweedy—specifically one calling him a \"mama's boy\". Part of the song's lyrics (\"Take the guitar player for a ride/See, he ain't never been satisfied/He thinks he owes some kind of debt/Be years before he gets over it\") are originally from Peter Laughner, an underground alternative rock artist from Cleveland that died at 24 in 1977, taken from his song \"Amphetamine\". The song concludes with the artist lashing out against the listener with satirical self-pity, a rebellion against the way that fans saw Uncle Tupelo as only an archetype of Gram Parsons inspired country rock. To induce a feeling of chaos on the track, the members of Wilco recorded a track where the members switched to novel instruments and placed sections of it into the song. The theme of a \"tortured artist\" is found in other songs as well; the end of \"Sunken Treasure\" features Tweedy calling for the renewal of his youth as a punk rocker.\n\nA dichotomy of musical styling was featured in the album's songs. \"Hotel Arizona\", \"Sunken Treasure\", and \"Misunderstood\" featured personal language and more surrealism compared to alternative country songs such as \"The Lonely 1\" and \"Far, Far Away\". To enhance this dichotomy between simple and surreal, each song was practiced, recorded, and mixed in only one day. The album's name was taken from the 1979 comedy \"Being There\", because the band believed that Peter Sellers' character Chance had an analogous mentality to the mindset of the album. Wilco sought to incorporate influences from other bands, but not to an overbearing degree; however, they were unable to accomplish this with songs like the Rolling Stones-influenced \"Monday\". Unlike radio-friendly \"A.M.\", the band had no preference about whether \"Being There\" could yield radio hits.\n\nWhen the recording sessions were done, Wilco had originally recorded thirty songs, but were able to cut it down to nineteen songs covering a span of seventy-seven minutes. Tweedy decided that he wanted to release all of the material as a double CD, but was concerned that consumers would be reluctant to purchase it. The purchasing price of a double album was at least $30, but single albums cost (at most) $17.98. Tweedy approached record executive Joe McEwen, who had originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner Brothers label, about selling \"Being There\" at a single album price. McEwen was reluctant at first, but was able to convince Reprise Records president Howie Klein to adhere to Tweedy's request. To compensate for the financial loss that the label would take, Tweedy agreed to cut most of his royalties for the album. By 2003, it was estimated that he lost nearly $600,000 because of this, but Tweedy remained satisfied by the deal.\n\n\"Being There\" was the only Wilco album with Freakwater's Bob Egan. Egan was invited to come to the studio after Freakwater opened for Wilco for a few shows. He only played on two tracks (\"Far, Far Away\" and \"Dreamer in My Dreams\"), but accompanied the band on the support tour. It was the last album for multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston, who left because he was undergoing marital problems and believed that Bennett was taking over his place in the band. Jeff Tweedy performed as the lead singer and secondary guitarist. Jay Bennett was the lead guitarist, and also played a variety of other instruments. John Stirratt played bass guitar and Ken Coomer played drums. All members of the band played a different instrument on \"Misunderstood\".\n\n\"Being There\" was received positively by critics. AllMusic editor Jason Ankeny gave the album a four-and-a-half stars and referred to it as \"the group's great leap forward.\" He praised the band's ability to juxtapose psychedelia and power pop with tracks that \"wouldn't sound at all out of place on \"Exile on Main Street\"\". Greg Kot, writing for \"Rolling Stone\", gave the album four stars and lauded how it \"venture[d] out into an anxiety-ridden world sure thing ... the solace they continue to find in rock and roll.\" Robert Christgau was more modest, writing \"there's no point in denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as you recognize its insularity.\" Ryan Schreiber of \"Pitchfork\" called Wilco \"massively improved as both a band and as songwriters\" but also noted that \"the two-disc set is really nothing more than a marketing scheme.\" \"Being There\" was ranked the 14th best album of the year on \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996. In 2003, \"Pitchfork\" named it the 88th best album of the 1990s. In 2004, Stylus Magazine placed 178th on their \"Top 101–200 Favorite Albums of All-Time\" list. The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nThe album was a marked improvement over \"A.M.\" on the \"Billboard\" charts. It peaked at number 73 on the \"Billboard\" 200, whereas \"A.M.\" failed to hit the chart at all. \"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\" was released as a single, and received moderate airplay on some college rock radio stations.\n\nValve used \"Someone Else's Song\" as a basis for the opening theme for The Engineer in their first-person shooter game \"Team Fortress 2\".\n\nAll songs written by Jeff Tweedy.\n\nWilco:\n\nAdditional musicians:\n"}

The SUA developed a reputation as one of the most militant trade unions in Australia and was closely associated with the communist movement in Australia. The SUA merged in 1993 with the Waterside Workers' Federation to become the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA).\n\nAustralian seamen were forerunners of maritime trade unionism. Efforts to form trade unions amongst merchant seamen trading out of Australian ports can be traced back to 1874, with the formation of the Sydney Seamen's Union and Melbourne Seamen's Union. The trade unions of this period inspired, among others, J. Havelock Wilson of the British National Union of Seamen, who served on Australian coasting vessels for a period in the late 1870s.\n\nBy 1890, a number of these unions had come together to form a loose federation called the Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia, which included New Zealand until the Federation of Australia in 1901 which did include New Zealand, and adopted the name Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA) in 1906. For nearly eighty years the SUA successfully improved the wages and conditions of its members by negotiations with employers and governments or by taking militant industrial action.\n\nFollowing World War I the SUA gained a reputation as a militant union, under the leadership of socialist-inclined Tom Walsh. During the World War II it was instrumental in ensuring the supply of civilian seafarers for the war effort.\n\nThe SUA also took part in a wide range of social and political issues over the years, for example campaigning for Aboriginal rights, opposing apartheid in South Africa, opposing the Vietnam War, and participating in the nuclear disarmament movement. The SUA also took part in the black bans and boycotts of Dutch shipping, where the union movement of Australia worked to aid the nascent Indonesian Republic, in particular, ensuring that no tugs towed Dutch ships. These bans commenced in September 1945, and continued through to 1949.The union's longest serving leader was Eliot V. Elliott who led the SUA from 1941–1978.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s the union was strongly active in campaigns to address the decline of the Australian shipping industry, as alternative transport modes became more prevalent, and shipowners used flag of convenience ships to reduce costs. Reduced manning levels aboard ships also negatively impacted union members, and the union negotiated with companies to maintain the job security of Australian maritime workers.\n\nDuring its long history the SUA underwent several amalgamations to increase its coverage of maritime workers, particularly as the size of the workforce decreased due to automation and the use of flag of convenience vessels. The Marine Cooks Bakers and Butchers Association (formed in 1908) amalgamated with the Seamen's Union of Australia in 1983, and the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association merged in 1988. In 1991 the Professional Divers' Association also amalgamated with the SUA, before it joined with the Waterside Workers' Federation to become the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) in 1993.\n\n\n"}

Geographically, Radisson is located halfway between the southern and northern most points in Quebec and is, besides Schefferville, the only non-native town north of the 53rd parallel in this province.\n\nDespite its remoteness, Radisson has plenty of services for its residents and travellers: two fuel stations, hotel, motel, campground (summer only), a general store, restaurants, gift shops, a school and a hospital. It is also home to a huge Hydro-Québec employee facility, from where guided tours to the Robert-Bourassa power station start. It also houses employees of Air Inuit who are stationed at La Grande Riviere Airport.\n\nThe Cree village of Chisasibi is about to the west, near the mouth of the La Grande River. To the East is the Trans-Taiga Road (French: \"Route Transtaïga\") that leads to the Caniapiscau Reservoir and the former construction camp of Caniapiscau (now used by a wilderness outfitter).\n\nRadisson was founded in 1974 to accommodate workers for the James Bay hydroelectric project and named by the Société de développement de la Baie James after Pierre-Esprit Radisson, a 17th-century French explorer and founder of the Hudson's Bay Company. During the peak construction period in 1977, its population reached about 2,500 and has fluctuated since that time. Currently it is a community of about 300 people. The main employer is Hydro-Québec and its main subsidiary, the Société de l'énergie de la Baie James. Many locals are also employed in the tourism/hospitality industry that caters especially to the outdoor sports, such as hunting, fishing, and camping.\n\nRadisson, also referred to on some unofficial maps as \"La Grande\", is part of the Municipality of Baie-James which covers most of the territory of James Bay region, with the exception of the Cree villages as well as towns of Chapais, Chibougamau, Matagami and Lebel-sur-Quévillon, all of which are enclaves.\nThe town is accessible by road from Matagami, to the south. The road is known as the James Bay Road (French: \"Route de la Baie James\") and was built during the construction of the James Bay Project in the mid-1970s. No services whatsoever are available along this road with the exception of a 24-hour service station, complete with cafeteria and lodging, at kilometre 381. The road is fully paved, well maintained and ploughed during the winter, making Radisson accessible year-round. It is also accessible via La Grande Rivière Airport.\n\n"}

He wrote an essay, \"Kierkegaard and the Philosophy of Inwardness\" in 1913 at a time when few had heard of Haecker and even fewer had heard of Kierkegaard. After that he translated Newman's famous \"Grammar of Assent\" and became a Roman Catholic convert in April 1921. He is known for his consistent opposition to the Nazi regime, which took steps to silence him, and his connections with the German resistance to them, such as the White Rose. It was during this time that he wrote his most important work, the journal titled collectively as \"Journal in the Night\". The notes in these journals are among the most impressive reflections on fascism. They are the documents of an intellectual's inner resistance against National Socialism. Haecker's achievement can be considered an important foundation of Christian resistance to National Socialism. Haecker had links with the circle around the Scholl siblings, where he read excerpts from his \"Journal in the Night\".\n\nIn early 1944, Haecker's house was completely destroyed during the bombing of Munich. With his sight failing due to worsening diabetes, he left Munich to live the last months of his life in the small village of Ustersbach near Augsburg. His daughter visited him but his son, Reinhard had been sent to the Russian front in early 1945, and was shortly after reported missing. Theodor Haecker died on April 9, 1945 and is buried in Ustersbach. There is a bust by sculptor, atop a fountain dedicated to Haecker in Laupheim near Ulm, paid for by the local citizens.\n\nAmong his papers was a manuscript possibly written in 1943 and published in English in 1950 as \"Kierkegaard The Cripple\". Haecker questions the claim by , in his two books \"Søren Kierkegaard seen from the Outside\" and \"The Special Cross\", that Kierkegaard was a hunchback. Haecker asks, 'What significance can be attached to an exterior, physical examination of someone whose work and achievements lie solely in the intellectual and spiritual realms of memory and of historical tradition and experience, as in the case of Kierkegaard? (...) Is there any point in trying to explain the connection between Kierkegaard's physical appearance and his inner self, the purely materially visible and spiritually non-sensual and invisible? Would not this make the inner man, the outer, and the outer man, the inner, which is precisely what Kierkegaard so passionately protested?\" Yet, Haecker goes on \"to examine the thesis that Kierkegaard's psychological structure was influenced by his deformity.\" He tried to relate Kierkegaard's inner life to his outer appearance.\n\nThe translator, Alexander Dru, says about Haecker's \"Journal in the Night\", \"This book, reminiscent in form of Pascal's \"Pensées\", is his last testimony to the truth and a confession of faith that is a spontaneous rejoinder to a particular moment in history. It is written by a man intent, by nature, on the search for truth, and driven, by circumstance, to seek for it in anguish, in solitude, with an urgency that grips the reader.\" In the opening to Dru's translation, Jacques Maritain (misspelled \"Jacques Maratain\") is quoted as saying, \"Theodor Haecker was a man of deep insight and rare intellectual integrity — a Knight of Faith to use Kierkegaard's expression. The testimony of this great Christian has an outstanding value.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250537", "title": "Bowling for Dollars", "text": "Bowling for Dollars\n\nBowling for Dollars was a television game show on which people could play the sport of bowling to win cash and sometimes prizes based on how well they bowled.\n\nUnlike most TV game shows of the time, which were taped in either New York or Hollywood and broadcast nationally, \"Bowling for Dollars\" was produced by local TV stations and featured contestants from the immediate area. The show was actually a franchise, created by Bert Claster of Claster Television, also the creator of \"Romper Room\". Episodes of \"Bowling for Dollars\" were taped either in a local bowling alley, or on a pair of bowling lanes constructed right inside the TV studio.\n\nThe show reached its heyday in the 1970s. The most recent station to air the format was Detroit, Michigan independent station WADL, which relaunched \"Bowling for Dollars\" in September 2013.\n\nThe show's main set consisted of a sliding door from which the host emerged, as did the contestants, one-by-one. There was also a Jackpot light with a numeric display of its value, and a \"Pin Pal\" container (see below). There were also stands set up for an audience.\n\nLocal editions may have varied, but there were two musical themes used. One was a custom theme for the show's opening and close (with a short phrase to introduce each contestant). The other was played when a contestant hit the jackpot, also used for commercial bumper music in some editions. The latter was an instrumental version of \"Keep the Ball Rollin'\" by Al Hirt, a song originally done by Jay & the Techniques.\n\nAs each contestant appeared, the host would interview him or her for a couple of minutes. Then the audience camera would cue as the contestant pointed out who he brought along (\"There's my wife Paula, there's my son Nick...\"). The contestant was then instructed to pick a Pin Pal out of a container filled with postcards sent in by home viewers, then went off to the lanes where they would bowl at least two balls.\n\nA half-hour show had seven contestants.\n\nEach contestant received $1 for each pin knocked down (e.g., a contestant who knocked down a total of eight pins won $8, though some versions may have had a $5 minimum for fewer than five pins). A strike or spare awarded $20. The real allure of the show was the Jackpot, which was awarded to any bowler who got two consecutive Strikes. The jackpot started at $200, $300, or $500 (depending on the version) and was increased by $20 each time it was not hit.\n\nSome versions of \"Bowling for Dollars\" awarded prizes in addition to the money. In the Detroit edition of the show, a contestant who got a spare won a dinner for two at a local restaurant. If that spare was a split, they would also get two large pies from Buddy's Pizza. If the contestant got only one strike, they got to pick a pin from a \"pin board\" for a prize from a local jeweler; one such prize was a genuine diamond ring. Finally, if a contestant did break the jackpot, he or she got to bowl one more time, and if that was a strike (a \"turkey\") they would receive yet another prize, such as a recliner chair or bicycle. The Los Angeles version awarded a portable television set for three consecutive strikes, and a car for four.\n\nEach contestant, just before approaching the bowling lane, was instructed to pick a postcard at random out of a large, horizontally mounted container. The name on the card was then read aloud by the host. These were Pin Pal cards, allowing a viewer at home to participate in the game on TV. Whatever the contestant won, the Pin Pal won also, although the jackpot may actually have been split between the two of them. Many people wrote clever messages on their Pin Pal cards, like \"Strike it rich!\" A Pin Pal was only eligible once per show, in case a Pin Pal tried to send an overwhelming number of postcards at one time.\n\nThe show's title has been so popular, it has been parodied quite a bit.\n\n\"Bowling for Dollars\" was broadcast from TV stations serving medium to large communities all across North America. In many of these markets, the host was introduced by the announcer as \"the Kingpin himself\".\n\nThere were two separate runs. Both aired on WBAL-TV, and both sites were filmed in studio (with bowling being with a Brunswick set):\nHosts: Bailey Goss, then Chuck Thompson\n<br>This show only required contestants to make one strike for the jackpot — a significantly harder task in duckpin bowling than in standard tenpins.\nHosts: Tom Cole, then Ron Riley, then Royal Parker\n<br>At one point, the show alternated between duckpin and tenpin bowlers.\n\nThis edition was titled \"Candlepins for Cash\", featuring the regional candlepin variation of bowling, and had two separate runs:\n\n\nBoth editions only required contestants to make one strike for the jackpot — a significantly harder task in candlepin bowling than in standard tenpins. In the last two seasons of the show, the player would get $30 for a spare plus one bonus ball, worth $2 more per pin knocked down. When a person threw a 10-box (all pins knocked down on the third ball) they got $20 plus one bonus ball.\n\nThe 2006 show \"Candlepins For Dollars\" that aired on WLVI Channel 56 was not related to this format.\n\n\nA revival of \"Bowling for Dollars\" aired between January and February 2008 on WGRZ, also hosted by Kilgore. This version, airing weekdays at 11:45 AM, was much shorter, with only one frame.

A pair of ceremonial guards are posted at two sentry boxes in the front of the residence and are relieved in a brief guard mounting ceremony and an exhibition drill. Guards are posted every weekend in the afternoon and evening hours and on national holidays.\n\nThe service branches of the Canadian Armed Forces typically maintains one or more public duties detachments and units. Public duties have been performed throughout the country, with public duties having been performed at various provincial capitals, typically at the legislature, or the official residences of the lieutenant governors. However, public duties in Ottawa and Quebec City are the only regularly scheduled performances in the country.\n\nPublic duties in Ottawa is formally the responsibility of two regiments of foot guards, the Canadian Grenadier Guards, and the Governor General's Foot Guards; with one of their main tasks being the provision of sentries for public duties in support of the Government of Canada in Ottawa. The two regiments of foot guards, alongside with the Governor General's Horse Guards, based in Toronto, make up Canada's Household Division. Public duties in which these regiments take part in includes mounting the guard at Parliament Hill; and Rideau Hall, the official residence for the Monarch, and the Governor General of Canada. The two units are also tasked with mounting the guard of honour for visiting dignitaries. Public duties were also performed by the Canadian Guards until 1970, when the unit was reduced to nil-strength, and moved to the Supplementary Order of Battle.\n\nThe Canadian Army also operates a summer public duties detachment known as the Ceremonial Guard, which assumes public duties in Ottawa from late-June to late-August. The Ceremonial Guard is made up of regulars or reservists of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Royal Canadian Navy. Public duties undertaken by the Ceremonial Guard includes sentry duties at the National War Memorial, Rideau Hall, as well as performing the Changing of the Guard ceremony in Parliament Hill, and the Fortissimo Sunset Ceremony. Members of the Ceremonial Guard wear the uniforms of the Canadian foot guards, as they have historically staffed the summer public duties detachment, before membership in the Ceremonial Guard was opened to the entire Canadian Armed Forces. The Ceremonial Guard are considered an \"ad hoc\" detachment, as its members are drawn from various units of the armed forces, and does not constitute a permanent unit in the Canadian Forces' order of battle.\n\nThe Canadian Armed Forces also maintains a National Sentry Program, where its members perform sentry duties at the National War Memorial from early-April to 10 November, the day before Remembrance Day. The program formally falls under the command structure of the Ceremonial Guard, although its volunteers may wear the full dress uniform of their respective units/service.\n\nPublic duties at the Citadelle of Quebec, a military installation in Quebec City, are carried out by the Royal 22nd Regiment. The regiment carries out public duties at the Citadelle of Quebec from late-June to Labour Day, which falls on the first Monday of September.\n\nThe military installation serves as the home garrison for the regiment, as well as the secondary official residence for the Monarch, and Governor General of Canada. The regiment has carried out public duties at the Citadelle since 1928, excluding a brief hiatus from 1939 to 1945, due to the Second World War.\n\nThere are two regiments in Denmark, who provide soldiers for public duties, the Royal Life Guard regiment and Guard Hussar Regiment. The Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron provide mounted escorts for the Royal family and foreign dignitaries, and carry ceremonial services for the Royal Danish Army.\n\nThe Royal Life Guards provide a permanent guard at the Amalienborg Palace, Kastellet (part of the old fortification of Copenhagen), Rosenborg Castle/garrison of the Royal Life Guards in Copenhagen and the garrison of Høvelte. On occasions guard is kept at Fredensborg Palace, Marselisborg Palace, Gråsten Palace, Christiansborg Palace and other locations inside the Danish realm.\n\nThe \"Wachregiment Berlin\" was founded in early 1921. In addition to genuine security duties, the unit was used for ceremonial public duties in the capital. The regiment was disbanded in June 1921 and shortly after was revived as \"Kommando der Wachtruppe\" (lit. Headquarters Guard Troop).\n\nThe \"Wachtruppe\" comprised seven companies, each drawn from one of the seven active army divisions. Each company served for three months before returning to its parent division. In this way, the Wachtruppe represented the whole Reichswehr.\n\nThe \"Kommando\" was based at Moabit Barracks, and every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, performed a modest changing of the guard ceremony for the public. On each Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, the entire \"Wachtruppe\", accompanied by the regimental band, marched from the barracks through the Brandenburg Gate and to the Berlin War Memorial, providing a greater spectacle for public view.\n\nIn 1934, the unit was renamed \"Wachtruppe Berlin\" and in 1936, a headquarters and administration company were added. In June 1937, the unit was again renamed \"Wach Regiment Berlin\". Postings were now done by individuals, not entire companies, and each man served six-month tours of duty. The unit provided escorts and Guards of Honour for State Visits, Conferences and even the Olympic Games.\n\nIn 1939, the unit was reorganized as the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland. While equipped as a field unit, the regiment also maintained a public duties detachment in the capital. The ceremonial guard was pressed into service during the July bomb plot in 1944 and helped round up conspirators in the capital.\n\nIn 1957, the post-war Bundeswehr established the Wachbataillon, a tri-service unit, for ceremonial duties.\n\nThe Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery three infantry battalions, incremental companies of the Foot Guards and Balaklava Company, 5 SCOTS (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) of the British Army are currently tasked with the provision of Public Duties. Two of these are from the Foot Guards of the Household Division, and two are an infantry battalion. The former are normally based at Wellington Barracks in central London, within a short distance of Buckingham Palace, and at Victoria Barracks in Windsor Castle, while the latter is at the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow.\n\nApart from providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, and the Tower of London Guard, the Public Duties battalions also provide the Windsor Castle Guard, which is otherwise provided by the battalion based at Windsor. From 1783 to 1973, the Guards provided a nightly detachment called the Bank Picquet for guard duty at the Bank of England.\nPublic duties are also carried out in Edinburgh, although not as frequently as in London. Prior to 2002, sentries were permanently stationed at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle, but these were withdrawn due to cost-cutting measures. Today, sentries are posted during the evenings between 6 pm and 9 am, and throughout the week that the monarch spends in Edinburgh at both the castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Sentries are also posted at the castle during the month of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo prior to each performance, with the regiment forming a guard of honour at the end of each performance.\n\nPublic duties are performed by Balaklava Company of the Royal Regiment of Scotland a single incremental company to be based permanently in Scotland for public duties.\n\nThe 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment is an official ceremonial unit of the United States Army, and has provided the escort for the President of the United States, as well as formally provides security for Washington, D.C.. Public duties performed the by the regiment includes ceremonies at the White House, the Pentagon, and other national ceremonies throughout the capital and its neighbouring areas. The guard also provide military escorts for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery, and a perpetual sentry at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier since 1948. Other service branches of the United States Armed Forces also maintain their own units for public duties in Washington.\n\nThe United States Army installation, Fort Huachuca, maintains a ceremonial cavalry troop known as B Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment. It is one of only four remaining in the Army, and is mounted ceremonies, parades, and public relations. B Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment resides at the main post stables and conducts events around the southwestern United States. Troopers are volunteers soldiers stationed at Fort Huachuca. Prior to being issued their horse, carbine, and saber, each recruit must undergo a three-to-four month riding school. Once proficient in mounted drill, the recruit must demonstrate a proficiency in saber, and carbine/pistol accuracy. Only then does the recruit become a Trooper and is issued a horse. B Troop was specifically chosen as it was the Troop that captured Geronimo in 1886.\n\nA number of other military units from the United States National Guard, and state militias also maintain units which undertake public duties. The Governor's Guards of Connecticut is another unit which engages in public duties for the state, primarily in the capital of Hartford. Composed of two foot guard units and two horse guard units, the company-sized unit is a part of the Connecticut State Guard, which is a branch of the Connecticut State Militia. Public duties undertaken by the Governor's Guard include presidential, and gubernational inaugurations, as well as supporting memorial dedications, local parades, and celebrations for Memorial Day and Veterans Day.\n\nThe Royal Guards of Hawaii is a ceremonial reenactment unit made up of members of the Air National Guard, formed in 1963. Public duties perform by the Royal Guards of Hawaii include official state functions involving the Governor of Hawaii, and other public functions for descendants of the House of Kawānanakoa, the descendants of the Hawaiian royal family. The uniforms used by the guards are similar to the uniforms used by the royal bodyguards of the former Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nThe Ross Volunteer Company serves as the guard of honour for the Governor of Texas. Formed in 1897, the unit is composed of junior and senior cadets of the Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets. The unit performs in ceremonial activities from its base at College Station, Texas, and its area of responsibility in Austin.\n"}

{"id": "2250567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250567", "title": "Line infantry", "text": "Line infantry\n\nLine infantry was the type of infantry that composed the basis of European land armies from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 19th century. For both battle and parade drill, it consisted of two to four ranks of foot soldiers drawn up side by side in rigid alignment, and thereby maximizing the effect of their firepower. By extension, the term came to be applied to the regular regiments \"of the line\" as opposed to light infantry, skirmishers, militia, support personnel, plus some other special categories of infantry not focused on heavy front line combat.\n\nLine infantry mainly used three formations in its battles: the line, the square and the column.\n\nWith the massive proliferation of small arms (firearms that could be carried by hand, as opposed to cannon) in the infantry units from the middle of 17th century, the battlefield was dominated by linear tactics, according to which the infantry was aligned into long thin lines and fired volleys. A line consisted of 2, 3 or 4 ranks of soldiers.\n\nThe soldiers were supposed to fire volleys at the command of officers, but in practice this happened only in the first minutes of the battle. After one or two volleys, each soldier charged a musket and fired at his own discretion, without hearing the commands of the officers. This brought confusion to the system, and the smoke interfered with accurate shooting. Such a shootout in a puff of smoke could occur for a very long period of time and the result was unpredictable. In addition, at the time of the “hot” shootout, the soldiers were so busy and focused on shooting that they could not notice the attack of cavalry from the flank. Therefore, experienced troops tried to avoid such costly shootouts and restrained their soldiers from premature firing, in order to get as close to the enemy’s line as possible to deliver several crushing volleys at a short distance. In some cases, it was possible to overturn the enemy with just one volley at a short distance. \nThe line was considered as the fundamental battle formation as it allowed for the largest deployment of firepower. Troops in skirmish formation, though able to take cover and use initiative, were highly vulnerable to cavalry and could not hold ground against advancing infantry columns. Line infantry provided an 'anchor' for skirmishers and cavalry to retreat to if threatened.\n\nAgainst surrounding enemy cavalry, line infantry could swiftly adopt square formations to provide protection. Such squares were hollow (consisting of four lines), unlike the pikemen's and old-style musketeers' square.\n\nMovement in line formation was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in column formations and then deploying to line at their destination. Usually, columns would be adopted for movement and melee attacks.\n\nLine infantry was trained in the manual of arms evolutions, the main objectives of which were fast deployment of a line, rapid shooting and manoeuvre.\n\nLine tactics required a strict discipline and simple movements, practiced to the point where they became second-nature. During training, the drill and corporal punishments were widely used.\n\nLine infantry quickly became the most common type of infantry in European countries. Musketeers and grenadiers, formerly elite troops, gradually became part of the line infantry, switching to linear tactics.\n\nOver time the use of line infantry tactics spread outside of Europe, often as a result of European imperialism. In European colonies and settlements with small populations from the home country, line infantry forces were often raised from the local population, with the British East India Company's sepoys perhaps being the most historically significant example.\n\nDuring 1814, in the War of the Sixth Coalition, the training of regular French line infantry recruits was very limited due to the fierce attack of the Coalition Forces. A recruit was trained by firing two cartridges and four blanks. There was also light training of forming several formations. By these examples, forming a massive extent of well trained, elite line infantry was a very complicated process.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the matchlock muskets of some line infantry were equipped with bayonets. Bayonets were attached to the muzzles of muskets and were used when line troops entered melee combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, a flaw within the design of matchlock muskets became more apparent. Since the matchlock musket used a slow burning piece of twine known as a slow match, the twine sometimes would accidentally set fire to the gunpowder reservoir in the musket prematurely setting off all of the gunpowder and bringing serious injury and death to the operator. During this time, matchlock muskets began to be replaced by lighter and cheaper infantry fusils with flintlocks, weighing 5 kg with a caliber of 17.5 mm, first in France and then in other countries. In many countries, the new fusils retained the name \"musket\". Both muskets and fusils were smoothbore, which lessened their accuracy and range, but made for faster loading, lesser amount of bore fouling and more robust, less complicated firearms.\n\nThe accuracy of smooth-bore muskets was in the range of 300-400 yards against a line of infantry or cavalry. Against a single enemy, however, the effective range was no more than 50-100 yards. It should be borne in mind that ordinary linear infantrymen were poorly trained in aimed shooting, due to the saving of gunpowder and lead (modern reenactors achieve much better results by firing smooth-bore muskets). Line infantrymen were trained in rapidly reloading their muskets. The recruit was expected to load 3 rounds a minute, while an experienced soldier could load between 4 to 6 rounds per minute. In battle conditions, this number was reduced and after the first few minutes of combat, no more than 2 rounds per minute could be expected even from well trained troops.\n\nThe bulk of the line infantry had no protective equipment, as armor that could provide protection from musket fire were considered too expensive and heavy. Only the former elite troops could keep by tradition some elements of protection, for example, the copper mitre caps of grenadiers.\n\nInitially, soldiers equipped with firearms formed only a small part of the infantry branch of most armies, because of their vulnerability to hostile cavalry. Pikemen formed the majority of infantrymen and were known as heavy infantry. A significant part of infantry consisted of old-style musketeers, who did not use the linear tactics, instead skirmishing in open formation. However, by the middle of the 17th century, musketeers deployed in line formation already provided about half of the foot troops in most Western European armies. Maurice of Nassau was noted as the first large scale user of linear tactic in Europe, introducing the 'counter-march' to enable his formations of musketeers to maintain a continuous fire. After the invention of the bayonet, musketeers could finally defend themselves from the enemy's horsemen, and the percentage of pikemen fell gradually. In 1699, the Austrian army got rid of their pikes. In 1703, the French army did the same, in 1704 the British and 1708 the Dutch. In 1699–1721, Peter I converted almost all Russian foot-regiments to line infantry. The abandonment of the pike, together with the faster firing rate made possible by the introduction of the new flintlock musket and paper cartridge, resulted in the abandonment of the deeper formations of troops more ideal for the melee-oriented pikemen. Instead, military thinking switched to shallower lines that maximized the firepower of an infantry formation.\n\nBesides regular line infantry, there were elite troops (royal guards and other designated elite regiments) and the light infantry. Light infantry operated in extended order (also known as skirmish formation) as opposed to the close order (tight formations) used by line infantry. Since the late 18th century, light infantry in most European countries mostly consisted of riflemen (such as the German Jäger), armed with rifled carbines and trained in aimed shooting and use of defilades. \n\nIn England, much of the light infantry was armed with smooth-bore muskets, only a few regiments used rifled muskets. \n\nIn France, during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the division into the Guard, while line infantry and light infantry formally continued to exist, line and \"light\" regiments had identical weaponry (smooth-bore fusils) and tactics. (Napoleon preferred smooth-bore weaponry for their faster reload speeds.) However, each battalion in both line and \"light\" regiments included a company of voltigeurs, who were expected to act as skirmishers as well being able to deploy into line.\n\nIn the Russian Empire, light infantry was forming at a very fast pace; by the end of the 18th century, light infantry regiments numbered 40,000 soldiers (jaeger). The armament of light infantry was very different from the armament of linear infantry. They were armed with high-quality muskets, as well as pistols (for close combat). After the unsuccessful army reforms of Paul I, the number of light infantry in the Russian army was significantly reduced and made up only 8% of the entire field infantry. But soon the Russian army returned to the trend of increasing the number of light infantry, begun in the 18th century. By 1811, 50 light infantry regiments were formed in the Russian army. In addition, in each linear battalion it was required to have 100 of the best shooting soldiers who fought in a loose ranks and covered their battalions from the enemy skirmishers. The total number of light infantry reached 40% of the entire field infantry. Unfortunately, the sharp increase in the number of light infantry greatly influenced their quality of training and equipment. The Russian infantry of 1854 comprised 108 regiments, of which 42 were line infantry. The remainder were specialized or elite units such as Guards, Grenadiers and Jägers. Only part of the Russian light infantry were equipped with the M1854 rifle, the remainder retaining smoothbore percussion muskets.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the coming of mass production and new technologies, such as the Minie ball, allowed European armies to gradually equip all their infantrymen with rifled weapons, and the percentage of line infantry equipped with muskets fell. In the American Civil War, both Northern and Confederate armies had only a few line regiments equipped with the old-style smooth-bore muskets. However, France, due to Napoleon III, who admired Napoleon I, had 300 line battalions (comprising an overwhelming majority) even in 1870. Although the French line infantry received Chassepot rifles in 1866, it was still being trained in the use of close formations (line, column and square), which was changed only after the dethronement of Napoleon III. This was common practice in all conventional Western armies until the late 19th century, as infantry tactics and military thinking had yet to catch up with the new technological development.\n\nIn the years after the Napoleonic Wars, line infantry continued to be deployed as the main battle force, while light infantry provided fire support and covered the movement of units. In Russia, Great Britain, France, Prussia and some other states, linear tactics and formation discipline were maintained into the late 19th century.\n\nWith the invention of new weaponry, the concept of line infantry began to wane. The Minié ball (an improved rifle ammunition), allowed individual infantrymen to shoot more accurately and over greatly increased range. Men walking in formation line-abreast became easy targets, as evidenced in the American Civil War. The Austro-Prussian War in 1866 showed that breech-loading rifles, which gave the individual shooter a greatly increased rate of fire, were greatly superior to muzzleloaded rifles. In the 1860s, most German states and Russia converted their line infantry and riflemen into 'united' infantry, which used rifles and skirmish tactics. After the Franco-Prussian War, both the German Empire and the French Third Republic did the same. However, Great Britain retained the name \"line infantry\", although it used rifled muskets from 1853, breech loading rifles from 1867, and switched from closed lines to extended order during Boer wars.\n\nThe growing accuracy and rate of fire of rifles, together with the invention of the Maxim machine gun in 1883, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe, while the defensive advantages given to line infantry against cavalry became irrelevant with the effective removal of offensive cavalry from the battlefield in the face of the improved weaponry. With the turn of the 20th Century, this slowly led to infantry increasingly adopting skirmish style light infantry tactics in battle, while retaining line infantry drill for training.\n\nWhile, as detailed above, linear battle tactics had become obsolete by the second half of the nineteenth century, regiments in a number of European armies continued to be classified as \"line infantry\" (or cavalry). This designation had come to mean the regular or numbered regiments of an army, as opposed to specialist or elite formations. Accordingly, the distinction had become one of traditional title or classification without significance in respect of armament or tactics. As an example, the \nBelgian Army of 1914 comprised 14 regiments of \"Infanterie de Ligne\" (line infantry), three of \"Chasseurs a pied\" (light infantry), one of \"Grenadiers\" and one of \"Carabiniers\". Similar differentiations were made in the majority of European armies of the period, although English-speaking authors sometimes use the designation \"line infantry\" when referring to the ordinary infantry of some other countries where the exact term was not in use.\n\nThe term was also used by US units during the Second World War, as shown by this quote from a report of the 782nd Tank Battalion in late April 1945:\nOn the 22nd of April, the Battalion moved from Oberkotzau, Germany to Wunsiedel, Germany. Here the attachment of the line companies to the Regimental Combat Teams of the 97th Division was completed. We separated, not coming together again until the war was over. Company \"A\" joined the 303rd at Rehau, Germany: Company \"B\" joined the 386th at Arzburg, Germany: and Company \"C\" the 387th at Waldsassen, Germany.\n\nThe modern British Army retains the traditional distinction between \"Guards\", \"Line Infantry\" and \"the Rifles\" on ceremonial occasions for historical reasons. It is linked to the order of precedence within the British Army and regimental pride, so for example Colonel Patrick Crowley states in the \"introduction\" in \"A Brief History of The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment\" (2015):\n\nInfantry of most 21st-century armies are still trained in formation manoeuvre and drill, as a way of instilling discipline and unit cohesion. Members of the US Army utilize the term \"line company\" (informally) in light infantry battalions to differentiate those companies (generally A–D) that perform the traditional infantry role from the support companies (generally F and HHC) charged with supporting the \"line companies\". The Marine Corps does the same for all its infantry units. In this vein, officers assigned to the rifle companies are referred to as \"line officers\" while billeted to positions such as Platoon Leaders and Commanding and Executive Officers.\n\n"}

Owned by Bell Media, the station broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format. CHUM's studios are located at 250 Richmond Street West in the Entertainment District, while its transmitter is located atop the CN Tower. The station also broadcasts nationwide on Shaw Direct channel 872, Bell TV channel 990, Bell Fibe TV channel 978, and locally on Rogers Cable channel 925, and is also available through live stream on iHeartRadio.ca and the iHeartRadio app.\n\nCHUM-FM is consistently one of Toronto's most popular stations according to Numeris' radio ratings, and is currently the third most listened-to private station in the market after Rogers Media-owned Adult Contemporary station CHFI-FM, and Newcap Radio's CHBM-FM.\n\nCHUM-FM started broadcasting on September 1, 1963 with an ERP of 18,000 watts and a transmitter and studio at 1331 Yonge Street. It aired a classical music format, the first station in Canada to do so. On March 21, 1966, their ERP was increased to 54,000 watts. In 1968, CHUM-FM received approval for a change in its transmitter location and increase in power to 100,000 watts. The transmitter was to be moved to the top of the Manufacturer's Life Building at 250 Bloor Street East.\n\nAt Midnight on July 1, 1968, CHUM-FM changed formats to progressive rock, a forerunner to the present-day adult album alternative format, by playing a wide range of music ranging from world music and jazz to classical and folk. The station also aired public affairs programming, such as \"In Toronto\". The station featured many famous Canadian radio personalities such as Larry Green, Walter Michaels, Steve Harris, Pete and Geets, Larry Wilson, David Marsden, David Pritchard and actor Rick Moranis.\n\nOn December 14, 1973, the station was authorized, along with other Toronto radio and TV stations, to move their transmitter to the top of the CN Tower. The new transmitter was turned on on May 31, 1976 with a reduced ERP of 40,000 watts.\n\nIn 1978, CHUM-FM created a Top 30 Album Chart to complement sister station CHUM's Singles Chart. A television version of the countdown was later broadcast on Citytv, featuring music videos for most of the songs in the countdown; the TV version was discontinued in January 2008, following Rogers Communications' acquisition of Citytv.\n\nIn June 1984, the station started evolving towards adult contemporary, with the shift completed by that September, though the station would retain a rock lean through the remainder of the decade. Longtime morning show host Roger Ashby would join the station from CHUM-AM on September 2, 1985, and would be paired with Rick Hodge (who had been doing sports updates on the FM's morning show since 1974). Marilyn Denis would join the show in July 1986, with the show becoming an instant success, making them some of the best known broadcasters in Toronto radio. Throughout the next two decades, CHUM-FM would usually be the highest rated station in the Toronto market, though it would occasionally alternate with CHFI, who was usually ranked a very close second, and would occasionally dip to third place behind CFRB.\n\nThe station evolved towards its current Hot Adult Contemporary format in 1990.\n\nOn May 26, 1998, CHUM-FM was granted a license to broadcast in Digital audio broadcasting using the Eureka-147 system. The transmitter was installed on the CN Tower and broadcast at 1456.304 MHz with an ERP of 5,084 watts.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, CHUM-FM's playlist has been noticeably more open to periodic, carefully selected rhythmic crossover songs, including R&B, reggae, hip hop, and dance music, while keeping some 1980s, 1990s and 2000s songs, as well as standard pop/rock material that forms the Hot AC format. The reason for this was to balance younger and older audiences. Many hot adult contemporary stations in Canada have followed this pattern and resulted in audience growth nationwide, making Hot AC the country's most listened-to format. The closest local competition musically within the format came from CKFM-FM, which leaned mostly younger.\n\nCHUM-FM also carried \"American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest\" from 2004 to 2006. In February 2017, the American Top 40 returned to CHUM FM along with On Air With Ryan Seacrest airing weekdays 10PM-1AM.\n\nAt the 25th Anniversary Canadian Music Industry Awards, held March 8, 2007, CHUM-FM was honoured as Station of the Year, Program Director of the year for CHUM-FM PD Rob Farina, and air talent of the year for \"Roger, Rick & Marilyn\". Former CHUM President Jim Waters was inducted into the Music Industry Hall of Fame that same evening.\n\nVP Programming Rob Farina moved to Astral Media as EVP of Content in 2009. David Corey, ex-APD at Kiss 108 in Boston, took over as program director that same year.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, CTVglobemedia purchased CHUM-FM and most of the other assets of CHUM Limited, the station's owners since their sign-on in 1963, following approval by the CRTC, while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Communications.\n\nOn June 23, 2008, Rick Hodge resigned from both CHUM and CHUM-FM to pursue other opportunities. Roger Ashby and Marilyn Denis continue to host mornings, which would then be titled \"Roger, Darren & Marilyn\" (when Darren B. Lamb joined the show after a stint of afternoon drive host); Lamb left the station on September 23, 2015, with mornings hosted by Ashby and Denis. Hodge moved to sister station CHRE-FM in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he remained until his retirement in 2019, and Lamb is now at CHFI.\n\nAlso in 2008, CTVglobemedia announced they had sold 1331 Yonge Street to a condominium developer and had acquired a new property, 250 Richmond Street West, to serve as the new home of CHUM and CHUM-FM. On August 18, 2009, CHUM-FM left 1331 Yonge Street, ending 46 years at its historic home. The site is slated to become a new condominium complex. The new building is adjacent (and connected) to Bell Media's headquarters at 299 Queen Street West (which also formerly housed the studios of Citytv).\n\nUntil late 2009, CHUM-FM continued to be the most listened to and most influential radio station in Canada with over 1,166,000 weekly listeners according to the BBM data released on December 3, 2007. But in December 2009, when CJEZ-FM flipped from adult contemporary to adult hits, adult contemporary rival CHFI became the most-listened-to radio station in Toronto. During the 2005-2009 season, CHFI continued to usually beat CHUM as the top-rated radio station in Toronto, although CHUM had unseated CHFI in some books. Also in 2009, CHUM-FM dropped most modern adult contemporary artists and large numbers of older songs from its playlist, and began leaning towards rhythmic AC. By 2011, CHUM-FM dropped most rhythmic artists and now patterns itself to be more of a mainstream Hot AC station. At this point, CHUM-FM's playlist closely resembled CHFI's, who began phasing in more currents and rhythmic content.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Bell Canada announced plans to re-acquire 100% of CTVglobemedia's broadcasting arm, including CHUM Radio. When the deal was finalized on April 1, 2011, CTVglobemedia became Bell Media, and likewise CHUM Radio became \"Bell Media Radio\", effectively retiring the last remaining piece of the former CHUM Limited company. CHUM Radio had been the only division of the company to retain the CHUM name following the acquisition of CHUM Limited by CTVglobemedia in 2007.\n\nBeginning in the summer of 2016, CHUM-FM began to ramp up advertising for new Bell Media partner brand iHeartRadio. Since then, the launch of iHeart Canada brought on some changes to CHUM-FM, including a new website, and a newly added \"iHeart\" sign to the CHUM building at 250 Richmond Street West underneath the famous CHUM neon sign. Also since the launch of iHeart, CHUM-FM has experienced a shift in programming, dropping most of its 1980s and 1990s songs from the playlist, focusing on playing more current hits, and a variety of recurrent songs from 1995 to the present. \n\nOn January 26, 2017, after nearly 40 years with CHUM-FM, midday host Ingrid Schumacher was released from the station. \n\nOn June 30, 2017, Sarah Cummings, former program director at CKLH-FM and CHRE-FM was named the new program director of CHUM-FM. \n\nOn June 22, 2018, the station underwent a major rebranding as part of an effort to appeal more strongly to women, including a new logo (amending its brand to \"CHUM 104.5\"), a generally hotter music direction, as well as a stronger emphasis on social media and community interaction.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, the CHUM morning show returned to three people with the addition of Jamar \"J. Niice\" McNeil from WBBM-FM/Chicago.\n\nCHUM's current host lineup includes Marilyn Denis, Jamar \"J. Niice\" McNeil, Ashley Greco, Meredith Shaw, Richie Favalaro, Taylor Kaye, Aiko Iwashita, and Shannon Burns.\n\nCHUM's morning show was hosted by Roger Ashby and Marilyn Denis for 32 years. The show originally featured Rick Hodge as an additional host until he resigned in 2008; after Hodge's resignation, Darren B. Lamb became a co-host, until he too resigned in September 2015. On July 16, 2018, the show returned to three people with the addition of Jamar \"J. Niice\" McNeil branded as \"Roger and Marilyn with Jamar\". On October 25, 2018, Ashby announced that he would retire from the morning show effective December 6th, after 50 years with CHUM/CHUM-FM. As of January 2019, the show is now branded as Marilyn Denis and Jamar (Jamar taking over Roger’s seat as co-host), and Marilyn Denis as host.\n\nUntil 2017, the CHUM morning show had a consistent hold as the highest-ranked and most listened-to morning show in the Toronto market. Despite the station's overall market share battle with CHFI, the CHUM morning show's average minute audience was over 50% higher than CHFI's morning show, which is hosted by former co-host Darren B. Lamb and Maureen Holloway. As of December 2017 though, Lamb and Holloway have claimed its spot as the #1 morning show in Toronto.\n\nOn July 4, 2017, CHUM-FM launched HD Radio multi-casting services. The HD1 sub-channel carried the same programming as the standard analog frequency, while the HD2 sub-channel carried a simulcast of sister station CFRB, and the HD3 sub-channel carried a simulcast of CHUM (AM). As of Spring 2018, CHUM-FM was no longer broadcasting in HD, with the sub-channels moving to sister station CKFM.\n\n\n"}

About 906 Cree with about 650 Inuit, living in the neighbouring village of Kuujjuarapik. The community is accessible only by air (Kuujjuarapik Airport) and, in late summer, by boat. Whapmagoostui is about north of the nearest Cree village, Chisasibi.\n\nAlthough the permanent cohabitation of Inuit and Cree at the mouth of the Great Whale River goes back only 1950, the two nations were rubbing shoulders in the area for a very long time, with the Inuit close to the coast and the Cree more in the interior.\n\nThe Cree have hunted and fished along the Hudson Bay coast long before the arrival of Europeans, it was not until 1820 when a Hudson's Bay Company trading post was built here, known variously as Great Whale River House, Great Whale River or just Great Whale. On maps of 1851 and 1854, the post is called Whale River House and Whale House. Protestant and Catholic missions settled there in the 1880s. In 1895, a weather station was set up by the Federal Government. Medical and police services began to be offered in the first half of the 20th century. Yet the Cree would not settle here permanently and only used it as a summer encampment.\n\nIn 1940 the Cree were forced to give up their nomadic way of life when the American army opened a military air base here. In 1941, the HBC post closed. After the World War II in 1948, the military base was transferred to the Canadian government. And in 1955, it began operating a Mid-Canada Line radar station. Though the radar station was not operational for long and closed in 1965, it established the village permanently.\n\nIn 1961, when the Quebec Government decided to give French names to northern settlements, the name Great Whale River was replaced with Grande-Baleine which itself was replaced a year later with Poste-de-la-Baleine. In 1979, the Cree Village Municipality, identified as Whapmagoostoo, was established. The Cree village itself was officially named Whapmagoostui in 1986, from then on replacing all other toponyms.\n\nIn 2013, seven young men from the community journeyed for \"Nishiyuu\", in support of Idle No More.\n\nPopulation:\n\nThe Cree School Board operates the Badabin Eeyou School (), which includes the includes the Meeyow Bee Nooquow School.

{"id": "2250580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250580", "title": "Slackwater darter", "text": "Slackwater darter\n\nThe slackwater darter (\"Etheostoma boschungi\"), is a small freshwater fish of the stippled darter group. The slackwater darter has a conspicuous dark subocular bar and three prominent saddles. It is rather drab in color, the dorsum being dusky, olivaceous, or brownish. The lateral blotches are dark brown to blue-black. The venter is slightly dusky and may have some orange and yellow pigments, which are more intense in males than in females. Maximum size is about 55 mm standard length.\n\nThe reproductive behavior of the slackwater darter varies with the temperature of the breeding habitat and the amount of rainfall. Spawning has not been recorded in water less than 14 °C. In addition, heavy rainfall must cause enough flooding to lift the darters into the breeding area. Usually, adult darters begin their migration to the breeding area in mid-January. They reach the breeding habitat in February, and spawning occurs in March. By April, the darter progeny are developing, and leave the breeding area in May. Young darters double in size between April and June. Evidence suggests the slackwater darter is a short-lived species with a lifespan of only three years.\n\nThe geographic range of the slackwater darter is five tributaries to the southern bend of the Tennessee River in northern Alabama and southwestern Tennessee. The species is known from one locality in the headwaters of the Buffalo River in Lawrence County, Tennessee, 19 localities in the Cypress Creek drainage in Wayne County, Tennessee and Lauderdale County, Alabama, three localities in Swan Creek, Limestone County, Alabama, three localities in the Flint River drainage in Madison County, Alabama, and one specimen was found in Shoal Creek, Lawrence County, Tennessee. Nothing is known of this darter's past distribution and abundance.\n\nPeriodic sampling in the headwaters of the Buffalo River in Lawrence County has indicated its population of slackwater darters is extremely small and limited. In this area, the species is confined to a short segment of a very small stream, and the number of individuals is apparently quite low. The population in the Flint River drainage in Madison County, Alabama, is similarly small and limited. The largest population and the stronghold of the species is in the Cypress Creek drainage system, Wayne County, Tennessee, and Lauderdale County, Alabama.\n\nThe slackwater darter uses two different, but adjacent, breeding and nonbreeding habitats. Its nonbreeding habitat is small to moderately large streams with a moderate to slow currents. The species seems to prefer bottom conditions characterized by an accumulation of leaves and detritus, but in some areas, it has been found in association with clean silt, sand, and small gravel substrates. Breeding habitat is seepage water in open fields or woods. The water in the breeding area, about 4 to 8 cm deep, flows slowly into an adjacent stream (the nonbreeding habitat). Since the breeding habitat is usually 30 to 45 cm above the stream, the stream water must periodically rise (as it does during heavy rains) to give darters access to the breeding grounds.\nThe restricted range of this species increases its vulnerability to the detrimental effects of human activity. Urbanization, ditching to drain areas with shallow groundwater, and degradation of ground and surface water from pesticides and waste are all serious threats. For example, the population in the Flint River drainage in Madison County, Alabama, is threatened by changing land use patterns associated with the growth of the city of Huntsville.\n\nThis species' existence is dependent upon adjacent and suitable breeding and nonbreeding habitats. If either of these habitats becomes unsuitable, darters will be extirpated from that location. A declining groundwater table has eliminated darter breeding sites in some areas. Slackwater darter breeding areas are also potential sites for farm fish ponds, which would inundate the habitat.\n\nThe future well-being of the slackwater darter will depend on wise use of the land and the general adoption of policies which will assure preservation of essential habitat needs. This species' recovery plan, approved in 1984, provides the following guidelines for its recovery: (1) establishment and protection of one or more specific habitat areas in at least three different tributaries to the Tennessee River System, with spawning areas protected by purchase or cooperative agreement; (2) data to show that populations are stable or increasing; and, (3) water quality and ecological data to indicate that the environment is suitable and stable or improving.\n\nThe above goals will be achieved by researching and providing this fish's survival needs. Some strategies, listed in the recovery plan, include: three- to five-year censuses near and in selected breeding habitats to determine and monitor populations; analyses of water quality and other characteristics in breeding and nonbreeding habitats; and research on the darter's reproductive and life cycles. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is also continuing to coordinate with the Soil Conservation Service to protect slackwater darter habitat in the Cypress Creek drainage, Tennessee.\n\n\"Note: This article was adapted from a public domain Fish and Wildlife Service report.\"\n"}
{"id": "2250585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250585", "title": "Xtabay", "text": "Xtabay\n\nLa Xtabay is a Yucatec Mayan myth about the Xtabay. The Xtabay is a female demon originating from a Mayan legend who has ill intentions towards men. She dwells in the forest to lure men to their deaths and, according to those that have escaped her, she possesses incomparable beauty and evil. She has beautiful black shiny hair that falls down to her ankles. The Xtabay resides in the Yucatán Peninsula. The legend of the Xtabay explains her story. There are many versions of the myth. One of the most accepted versions of the myth comes from the book \"Diez Leyendas Mayas\" (1998) written by Jesus Azcorra Alejos. The original myth is in Spanish and the text was translated into English.\n\nThe term \"Xtab\" was used to refer to an ancient Mayan goddess Ixtab, the goddess of suicide. According to \"Perez' Lexicon of the Mayan Language\", the feminine prefix tab, taab,and tabil means \"rope intended for some exclusive use.\" Ixtab is known as goddess of the halter and the goddess of the gallows. The belief was that whoever hung themselves would not go to the underworld but to paradise. The people who committed suicide were retrieved by the goddess Ixtab in the ancient Mayan tradition because suicide was considered an honorable way of dying.\n\nThe legend begins with two women who lived in a village in the Yucatán Peninsula. One woman was named Xkeban and the other Utz-colel. Xkeban was called the sinner and Utz-colel was called the good woman. Xkeban and Utz-colel were both equally beautiful. However, Xkeban was involved in many love affairs while Utz-colel was known for her purity and virtue. The townspeople looked down on Xkeban for her promiscuous behavior and belittled her whenever possible. Xkeban did good deeds for the poor, sick and animals in need. Unfortunately, the townspeople could not see her kind heart. They wanted to throw Xkeban out of the town, but they decided to allow her to stay in order to humiliate her. Xkeban was able to remain sympathetic and kind-hearted through the love of the sick and poor. On the other hand, Utz-colel was cold-hearted; she despised those in need and thought everyone was inferior to her. The townspeople loved Utz-colel because she was celibate. They did not see or care that Utz-colel would not give any food to the poor or help the sick.\n\nDays passed and Xkeban had not been seen and the townspeople assumed she was busy with men. More days passed and a sweet scent came from Xkeban's house. The house smelled so sweetly of perfume that the townspeople decided to investigate the smell. To their surprise they found Xkeban's dead body surrounded by flowers and animals guarding her. Utz-colel told the town that her smell was the trick of the devil to deceive them. The homeless and poor had a funeral for Xkeban and flowers mysteriously surrounded her grave.\n\nUtz-colel thought she was going to smell even better than Xkeban when she died because of her purity. Time passed and Utz-colel died. To the surprise of the townspeople, Utz-colel smelled horrible and the stench was unbearable. The townspeople went to her funeral and the flowers put around her grave disappeared the next day.\n\nXkeban was converted to a flower known as a Xtabentun. The flower has a sweet fragrance and found in hedges. The flower seeks shelter in the hedges because it is defenseless just as Xkeban felt defenseless when she was a human. Utz-colel became a flower called Tzacam, and it grows on top of a spiky cactus and the flower has an unpleasant odor. Utz-colel came to the conclusion that since Xkeban gave into her desire of love she too needed to do this and that is why she was punished after death. Utz-colel called evil spirits which assisted her into becoming a woman again to fulfill her desire for love. Her wicked heart, however, only allowed evil. Therefore, Utz-colel transformed from the Tzacam into the Xtabay.\n\nThe Xtabay wears a white dress and has large black eyes that attract all the men that are out late at night. She waits behind a ceiba tree and then invites them to have sexual relations with her and, because of her beauty, these men are drawn to her. Once they have sex, the Xtabay then transforms into a poisonous serpent and devours them. In other versions of the myth, the Xtabay appears in any form or sex that will lure an individual person. As a female, the Xtabay will be seen under a tree to lure and then throw her victim over a cliff. Once she throws him over a cliff, she will then rip his heart out of his chest.\n\nXkeban was looked down upon by the townspeople for her actions, but she was considered virtuous because of her kind heart. Since Xkeban helped the poor, sick, and animals she was considered a good person when she died. This is why she became the Xtabentun flower. Utz-colel on the other hand believed she was virtuous because of her physical purity, but she was actually wicked and the sinner. Even though Xkeban was involved with many men, she did it out of love. The moral of the legend is that virtue is within the heart and not only actions.\n\nThe theme of death is continuous with all of the different versions of the myth of the Xtabay.\n\nThe fear of death in the myth relies on the capability of the dead to cause harm to the living and the belief that the dead have hostile intentions.\n\nIn \"La Xtabay\", the symbolism of the human heart is often repeated throughout the myth. Both character's personality were described based on the type of heart they possessed. Xkeban had a kind and warm heart and Utz-colel had a cold heart. The reason why Xkeban became a Xtabentum when she died was because of her virtuous heart and Utz-colel became a prickly cactus because her heart was not pure. After Utz-colel became a tzacam flower on a cactus, she tried to ask the evil spirits to let her love because she thought if she could love she would be able to become a beautiful white flower of the xtabentun plant. She was granted her wish but since she could only love with a rotten heart her love was evil.\n\nThe ceiba tree is a sacred tree of the Mayan people, and the belief was that if a person's heart was virtuous, then they could become a ceiba tree after death. In the legend, the Xtabay uses the ceiba tree to hide herself behind in order to surprise her victims because she knows the meaning behind the tree. The ceiba tree is loved and is considered to connect both the heavens and underworld. It said in the legend that the ceiba roots are where all the men the Xtabay has taken from earth go and that no one has returned from there.\n\nThe Xtabay is known for her long black hair falling past her shoulders. In the legend, the Xtabay combs her long hair with the spines of the tzacam cactus. Mayan culture puts importance on keeping hair long and healthy, but the humid weather and long work day make this task difficult and so the working woman's hair is pulled up from the face. Xtabay's hair contrasts the typical hairstyle of Mayan women but represents the culture's ideal of beauty.\n\nUtz-colel was known for her purity because she abstained from sexual relations. In Mayan culture, women are encouraged to be modest and abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage. Women symbolize purity and are taught not to talk to men by themselves. If a Mayan woman does not follow these cultural expectations she is condemned for her actions. Xkeban was shamed and humiliated by her townspeople because she did not follow the traditional ways of how women should behave with men. The Xtabay lures men with seduction and this is against the traditional Mayan culture.\n\nContemporary Maya people do not think of these myths and legends as the past but instead as part of their culture today. They use myths such as \"La Xtabay\" to influence current beliefs and way of life. In the Yucatán peninsula, the word Xtabay illustrates undesirable behavior in women and men. Grandmothers and mothers use the legend to teach good behaviors to their children. In 1985, in Akumal, Quintana Roo in a restaurant, a young girl was told by her brother that she looks like the Xtabay. The young girl at the time did not know the legend and started to repeat loudly, \"I am the Xtabay! I am the Xtabay!\" Her mother heard the girl say this and became angry and embarrassed. The mother brought the girl behind a palm tree for discipline and \"I am the Xtabay\" was never repeated again by the child. This myth also has influence over marriages today. To prevent infidelity, it is said that the Xtabay lures husbands who left their home at night to drink alcohol and seek the attention of other women. It is also said that the Xtabay is a siren and sings a song that seduces the men towards her, and then she devours them. The myth is used by grandparents and parents to mold their children into never going out into night to drink or cheat on their wives.\n\nThe legend of the Xtabay has influenced music. Les Baxter's album \"Voice of the Xtabay by Peruvian soprano Yma Sumac\" depicts the lure of the xtabay in her music.\n\nThere are many \"La Llorona\" Mayan myth variations and overall, throughout these myths, there were different \"La llorona\" types including \"La Llorona,\" \"La Malinche,\" \"La inferiz Maria\" and \"La Xtabay.\" La Llorona, also known as the weeping woman, was abandoned by her lover and after she was abandoned, she killed her infant and then herself. Because of these deeds, she was forced to wander and suffer for eternity. She was said to be heard first in 1550 crying in the streets and then she disappeared in a lake. La Malinche had three sons by three different men, and she drowned her three lovers. She heard a voice saying her sons became a doctor, priest and lawyer. La Malinche went to look for them along the rivers and called to them endlessly. La inferiz Maria killed her three sons for an exchange with the devil for beauty. However, her head turned into a horse's head and her feet turned into roster and horse feet. Her wailing sounds near when she is far and sounds far away when she is near. In addition, people who look at La Malinche have their necks stuck in the position in which they looked at her and must be cured by a \"curandero\" (healer). Variant versions of the myths of La Llorona are told throughout Mexico and because of the versions, La Llorona can be pitied and feared at the same time. Throughout all of the myths, La Llorona is known as \"the white lady\" because in all the versions of the myth she wears white.\n\n"}

It was the only stock to have luggage racks, umbrella hooks and separate power and braking controls, and the last stock not to have any automated announcements.\n\nThe design was formulated by W S Graff-Baker of the London Passenger Transport Board, as part of the electrification of the Metropolitan line from to Amersham and under the 1935–1940 New Works Programme, and owes much to the smaller 1938 Stock. The project was delayed by World War II and lack of funds during the austerity period after the war. In 1946 two experimental trailers similar in exterior appearance to the production trains were built using underframes from T Stock, but they were scrapped when the trials concluded. Graff-Baker died in 1952, before the trains were finally built.\n\nWhen electrification commenced in 1959, London Transport placed an order for 31 \"A60 Stock\" trains to replace both T Stock on services to and Rickmansworth, and locomotive-hauled services to destinations north of Rickmansworth. The first units, 5004 and 5008, entered service to Watford in June 1961. The Amersham/Chesham services began later that year. London Transport later ordered 27 \"A62 Stock\" trains; these were introduced between 1961 and 1963 to replace F and P Stocks on the service. By December 1963 the roll-out was complete.\n\nThe trains were designated as \"A\" Stock to mark the electrification of the Metropolitan line to \"A\"mersham. Four-car units were used on the East London line (then a branch of the Metropolitan line) from June 1977 to April 1985, May 1987 to 24 March 1995 and 25 March 1998 to 22 December 2007, when the line closed to become part of the London Overground network.\n\nThe stock was a compromise between the needs of longer-distance \"outer suburban\" passengers on the outer reaches of the line and short-distance \"urban\" passengers over the heavily used Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. For this reason the trailer cars have three sets of doors per car.\n\nA distinctive feature was the use of transverse seating only, uncommon on the Underground. This is because it was designed for journeys which might last over an hour. Most of the seating was of the high-capacity transverse 3 + 2 arrangement. Four tip-up seats were provided at the rear of the driving motor. Despite each 8-car train seating 448 passengers, the stock provided fewer seats than the locomotive-hauled and T stock trains that they replaced, but more seats than the S Stock which started to replace them on 31 July 2010. The stock had luggage racks and umbrella hooks, the only Underground stock to have these features, despite their presence on most contemporary British Rail stock. The A stock were the last subsurface trains built with headlights positioned on the left side of the cab giving them an asymmetrical appearance. They also had three tail lights positioned underneath the cab although one was removed during refurbishment\n\nA60 and A62 stocks were nearly identical in appearance. The most significant differences were the border around the destination window on A62 motor cars and the make of compressor under the trailer cars: A60 stock used the Westinghouse DHC 5A, A62 cars the Reavell TBC 38Z.\n\nAt they were the Underground's widest trains.\nThe stock was refurbished between 1993 and 1998 by Adtranz (now Bombardier) in Derby. Car end windows were installed, the seating was reupholstered, and the livery was updated. At the time of refurbishment the Metropolitan line had a low priority for receiving new trains.\n\nEach unit consisted of four cars: two powered driving motors at each end and two non-powered trailers in between. Each unit was further divided into two semi-permanently-coupled sets, a driving motor and trailer. Although the intention was to operate four-car trains in the off-peak, this practice was short-lived except for the Chalfont & Latimer–Chesham shuttle, which was always operated by a single four-car unit. For its main services the stock operated in a two-unit formation of eight cars between and Amersham, Chesham (peak hours only), Uxbridge and Watford.\n\nWhen built it had a top speed of (world's fastest fourth-rail train), but from the late 1990s/early 2000s it was restricted to to improve reliability.\n\nIn addition to the Metropolitan line, A Stock was permitted to traverse the following sections, subject to the following restrictions:\n\nCars had a four-digit number. The first digit identified the type of car (driver or trailer), the last three digits the set (000 to 231).\n\nIn further detail:\n\n^ operational DM\n† Renumbered\n+ Replaced/formed with a renumbered car\n\nRenumberings:\na. 5034 and 5008 swapped numbers in July 1985; new 5008 and 6008 became set 5234-6234 in September 1994, 5034 preserved at the London Transport Museum, Acton.\nb. set 5009-6009 renumbered 5235-6235 in September 1994.\nc. set 5028-6028 renumbered 5232-6232 in June 1985.\nd. 5036 renumbered 5116 in April 1993 (original 5116 scrapped in 1987 – collision at Kilburn, December 1984)\ne. set 5117-6117 renumbered 5233-6233 in August 1985; set 5037-6037 renumbered 5117-6117 in April 1993.\nf. 5208 renumbered 5218 in August 1992 (original 5218 scrapped in 1994 – experimental suspension)\ng. 5209 renumbered 5121 in March 1993 (original 5121 scrapped in 1994 – collision at Neasden depot, October 1986)\nConverted works vehicles:\ns. Sandite dispenser car.\nWithdrawals:\n1. \n2. \n\nA60 Stock reached 50 years of service on 12 June 2011. The age of the stock made spare parts harder to obtain and vehicles had to be cannibalised to keep the rest of the stock in operation.\n\nS8 Stock replaced the stock, with the first unit introduced on 31 July 2010. This is similar to the S7 Stock for the District, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines; the main differences are the layout and number of seats and the provision of two sand hoppers for each rail due to the different conditions at the country end of the line. The withdrawal of A Stock commenced on 20 January 2011.\n\nIn February 2012 the London Transport Museum began offering luggage racks from withdrawn A Stock for sale.\nThe last train ran in passenger service on 26 September 2012, formed of 5034 + 5062. The same train was used on 29 September 2012 for the final ticket-only railtour, organised by the London Transport Museum. It ran from Moorgate along the entire Metropolitan line, including Watford, Amersham, Aldgate, Uxbridge, Chesham and the Watford North curve. The tour ended at Wembley Park: on the final stretch from Finchley Road, the train was unofficially recorded at 74 mph. One of the driving motor cars, 5034, was part of the first (as 5008) and also the last A Stock train, giving it a life of over 51 years. It was sent to Northwood sidings on 8 October 2012 and loaded onto lorries for disposal. The historical age and significance of No.5034 saw it taken to the Acton Museum Depot for preservation but vehicle 5062 was scrapped.\n\nThe stock survived in engineering use as a Rail Adhesion Train until March 2018, when it too was scrapped, giving the stock a total life of 57 years. It had been last used in December 2017, when it had developed a fault and repairs were deemed unnecessary, as it was planned to be scrapped after the end of the year anyway, being replaced by a D78 stock unit.\n\nThe night of 24 May 2018 was the final time an A stock unit ran under its own power on the London Underground network. Set 5234/6234/6235/5235 worked train 710 from Neasden Depot to Ealing Common Depot. The set was subsequently removed from the adjacent London Transport Museum depot at Acton Town by road for disposal on 17 and 18 July 2018.\n\nThe stock outlasted many former British Rail EMUs: the Scottish Class 303 managed 43 years, the Class 309 Clacton Express units 38 years and British Rail Class 312 only 28 years. The former Southern Region 4CIG and 4CEP managed 46 and 49 years respectively. The stock was one of Britain's longest-serving types of train, although falling short of the service length of the ex-1938 Stock still in use on the Isle of Wight 81 years after construction and the Class 487 units which pushed through to just under 53 years, or the 81 years of Glasgow Subway rolling stock between 1896 and 1977. A Stock may be outlasted by the Bakerloo line 1972 Stock.\n\n\n"}

Fox McKeithen\n\nWalter Fox McKeithen (September 8, 1946 – July 16, 2005) served five terms as Secretary of State of Louisiana between 1988 and 2005. He is best known for merging the state's election divisions into one department and for the promotion of historical preservation.\n\nMcKeithen was born in rural Columbia, Louisiana to John Julian McKeithen and the former Marjorie Howell Funderburk. According to his tombstone, he was named for two World War II heroes, Walter Bennett and Elmer Fox. He graduated as class president in 1964 from Caldwell Parish High School, the same month in which his father was inaugurated as governor of Louisiana. One of his classmates was future associate justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, Chet D. Traylor. McKeithen attended Louisiana Tech University in Ruston in Lincoln Parish to obtain a bachelor's degree in history and social studies.\n\nAfter graduating from Louisiana Tech, McKeithen returned to Caldwell Parish High School, located off U.S. Route 165, as a civics teacher and coach. He also established three businesses in Caldwell Parish.\n\nIn 1983, McKeithen was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives as a Democrat when the incumbent Thomas \"Bud\" Brady of La Salle Parish was shifted into District 22, where he defeated sitting Representative Richard S. Thompson and former legislator W.L. Rambo. \nIn 1987, McKeithen was elected secretary of state. In the nonpartisan blanket primary, McKeithen led with 462,965 votes (34 percent) to 365,151 (27 percent) for his principal challenger, fellow Democrat Mike Cutshaw, an attorney for the Louisiana Bankers Association. Two Republican candidates, M. A. \"Mike\" Tassin and Bobby A. Patrick, shared 13 percent of the vote, and two other Democrats held a combined 19 percent. Three \"no party\" candidates polled 8 percent. In the general election, McKeithen only narrowly prevailed over Cutshaw, 490,190 (51 percent) to 467,582 (49 percent).\n\nIn the summer of 1989, McKeithen switched to the Republican Party, whose chairman, William \"Billy\" Nungesser, had courted him for a possible 1990 campaign for the United States Senate against the Democrat J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. Upon making the party switch, the GOP helped McKeithen pay off $400,000 in campaign debts.\n\nMcKeithen announced that he would run for the Senate but dropped such plans when the Republican state convention on January 13, 1990, endorsed State Senator Ben Bagert of New Orleans as the party's preferred candidate. Ultimately, Johnston was reelected in a showdown with another Republican, the maverick David Duke, a former figure in the Ku Klux Klan. Bagert left the race two days before the election at the request of national Republican leaders, who endorsed Johnston over Duke. In the 1972 general election, John McKeithen had run as an Independent for the Senate in an unsuccessful race against Johnston. Fox McKeithen's father and daughter, Marjorie A. McKeithen (born 1965), both opposed the party switch and remained Democrat.\n\nIn 1991, McKeithen faced a close contest for reelection as secretary of state. Two Democrats, Mary Chehardy (later a Republican) and Doug Schmidt, challenged him. McKeithen led in the primary, with 629,237 votes (46 percent) to Schmidt's 387,243 (28 percent). Close behind was Chehardy with 357,173 (26 percent). Schmidt, who used the expression \"Get the Fox out of the Henhouse\", advanced to the general election against McKeithen. In the showdown, McKeithen prevailed by 9,151 votes, a margin similar to David C. Treen's plurality over Democrat Louis Lambert in the 1979 gubernatorial contest. Returns gave McKeithen 827,506 votes to Schmidt's 818,355.\n\nIn subsequent elections, McKeithen was often endorsed by Democrats and worked well with members from both parties. His folksy manner meant that he was generally popular with voters despite adopting such unpopular positions as raising the pay of elected state officials. In his last race in 2003, he even carried the endorsement of organized labor, which rarely supports Republicans. During January 2004, McKeithen supervised the combining of the former elections department into the secretary of state's office.\n\nA few weeks later, when voting machines were slow to arrive in New Orleans in time for the 2004 elections, he helped to deliver them himself. McKeithen's gravestone in Caldwell Parish lists his principal accomplishments as the restoration of the Old State Capitol in Baton Rouge, the Cotton Museum in Lake Providence, the Delta Music Museum in Ferriday, and the Louisiana Exhibition Building in Shreveport.\n\nAfter a fall in the garage of his home in Baton Rouge in February 2005, McKeithen was hospitalized with paralysis from the neck down. Trouble struck again, and he re-entered the hospital on June 21 with a serious infection caused from the fall. He resigned as secretary of state on July 15, 2005, and died just a few hours later. He left his state pension to his widow, Yvonne Y. McKeithen.\n\nAlan Ray Ater, a former state representative from Ferriday in Concordia Parish became the acting secretary of state on McKeithen's death by virtue of having been the first deputy secretary of state. Ater did not seek the position in the special election held on September 30, 2006, to fill the remaining fifteen months of McKeithen's term. Late in 2006, Ater hence turned over the office to Republican state Senator Jay Dardenne (pronounced DAR DEN) of Baton Rouge. Dardenne was declared the winner of the special election after the runner-up candidate, outgoing Democratic state Senator Francis C. Heitmeier of New Orleans withdrew from a pending runoff election, which would have coincided with the November 7 national general election. In the September 30 election, Dardenne led with 30 percent of the vote. He ran up large margins in the greater Baton Rouge area and finished second in other portions of the state. Heitmeier, who ran best in liberal and labor areas of the state, trailed with 28 percent.\n\nA third candidate, the conservative former Louisiana Republican State Chairman Mike Francis of Crowley in Acadia Parish, finished with 26 percent of the ballots. He ran well in Acadiana and his native north Louisiana — he is originally from Jena in La Salle Parish - but trailed badly in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and the Florida Parishes.\n\nIn 2006, McKeithen was inducted posthumously into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, an honor that his father had procured in 1993, having been among the first thirteen honorees.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2250629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250629", "title": "Hur Jun (TV series)", "text": "Hur Jun (TV series)\n\nHur Jun () is a South Korean television series about the life of Joseon-era doctor Heo Jun. The period drama was broadcast by MBC from 1999 to 2000, and reached record-breaking viewership ratings of 64%.\n\nInternationally, it aired on Taiwan Television in 2002 and Hong Kong's TVB in 2005, after the finale of \"Dae Jang Geum\" (which was also directed by \"Hur Jun\" director Lee Byung-hoon). Because of the similarities between the protagonists of both shows, \"Hur Jun\" has often been called the male version of \"Dae Jang Geum\". It aired in Thailand on Channel 3 in 2006.\n\nThe story is set in Joseon, primarily during the reign of King Seonjo, 50 years after the death of Jang Geum (reputedly the first female doctor in Joseon).\n\nHur Jun was the son of a devon (\"untouchable\") mother. Due to his mother's social position, he was also considered sangnom under Joseon law at the time, even though his father was from the ruling caste and held office as a local magistrate. As a result, he faced much discrimination, which caused him to lose focus and direction, and eventually led him to participate in smuggling operations. At this time, Hur Jun became familiar with Da-hee, an upper-class lady who was in exile. Her father was branded a traitor and died in exile. Hur Jun sympathized with her and handled all of her father's funeral affairs. Not long after that, Hur Jun's smuggling activities were discovered, and his life was saved by his erstwhile uncaring father, who also rescued his mother and Da-hee, and smuggled them out of their town. Hur Jun and Da-hee eventually got married and moved to Saneum, in Gyeongsang Province.\n\nOnce, Hur Jun's mother fell ill, and he sought the help of a famous local physician, Yoo Ui-tae. Hur Jun became interested in medicine and became Yoo Ui-tae's pupil to study it. He proved to have an aptitude for medicine, and being very studious, he progressed very quickly. His studies attracted the attention of Ye-jin, an orphaned lady who lived with Yoo Ui-tae and began to mentor Hur Jun in the area of medicinal usage.\n\nHur Jun's medicinal prowess continued to grow, but he still had no chance to practice. He received his first patient when an elderly couple brought their unconscious daughter to his house. Apparently, she tried to hang herself and had almost died. Hur Jun, with some innovative remedies, managed to revive her, but refused to accept payment for his services. The couple decided instead to spread news of their benefactor's deeds to their friends and neighbors. This unwittingly brought Hur Jun many impoverished patients who had heard he was both skilled and offering free examinations.\n\nYoo Ui-tae was initially angry because he thought Hur Jun had not acquired sufficient medical knowledge to treat patients in the first place and was only making use of his own name to earn some money quickly. Nonetheless, Yoo Ui-tae investigated Hur Jun's diagnoses and prescriptions for each of the poor patients he treated, and realized Hur Jun was indeed competent and correct in his practice. He was further pleased that Hur Jun had not profited at all from the poor patients. To reward Hur Jun, Yoo Ui-tae placed him in charge of the local drug store.\n\nLater, Hur Jun received the opportunity to treat the wife of a high-ranking gentry. She had suffered a stroke, which rendered her paralyzed and bedridden. All of the physicians who had examined her had concluded that her condition was hopeless, but Hur Jun managed to cure her completely. This earned the respect of the gentry, who wrote a letter of recommendation for Hur Jun to join the Imperial Hospital; the letter was written to help Hur Jun circumvent the rigorous testing normally needed to enter. This angered Yoo Ui-tae, a strict traditionalist who saw this as a grave ethical lapse in judgement to use personal connections to bypass the exam system.\n\nMeanwhile, two other doctors began to mentor Hur Jun, who eventually decided to join the medical examination in Hanyang (modern day Seoul). When Hur Jun arrived in Hanyang, he failed to join the examination because of his decision to treat a critically ill patient. This increased his popularity, and also enabled the re-acceptance of Yoo Ui-tae. Conversely, Yoo Ui-tae's own son, Yoo Do-ji, who had refused to treat the patient, placed first in the examination. Yoo Ui-tae rebuked his son for his lack of compassion for patients and using his medical skills to advance his political aspirations. Yoo Do-ji was unrepentant and his father subsequently disowned him.\n\nNot long after that, Yoo Ui-tae became terminally ill with stomach cancer. He committed suicide and left his body to Hur Jun to dissect it and increase his understanding of anatomy and physiology. This greatly advanced Hur Jun's medical knowledge and made him even more committed to medicine, and in an examination for entry into the Imperial Hospital he placed first and was granted entry.\n\nIn the Imperial Hospital, Hur Jun met his mentor's son, Yoo Do-ji, who had been diligently and unscrupulously progressing through the ranks. Hur Jun also met the Chief Imperial Doctor, Yeong, who lost in an acupuncture competition to Hur Jun's mentor 20 years ago. Knowing how Hur Jun was connected to Yoo Ui-tae, Yeong placed Hur Jun in an unimportant department in the Hyeminseo Hospital.\n\nUpon his arrival at Hyeminseo, Hur Jun encountered Ye-jin (who worked there as a nurse). Ye-jin was secretly in love with him, but their relationship would always be solely platonic.\n\nDuring this time, Yeong restricted Hur Jun's career in every way possible, which ended when the brother of the King's favorite concubine suffered from stomach cancer. The doctors in the Imperial Hospital exhausted all possibilities in treating the patient, but to no avail. Hur Jun successfully treated the patient in five days before Yeong could. This ended the restrictions imposed by Yeong.\n\nDuring the 22nd year of Seonjo's reign, a national epidemic occurred. An officer who had arrested Hur Jun some time ago was transferred to the palace. Hur Jun, though troubled, went to the epidemic areas to perform research for a cure, which he found. Upon his return, Hur Jun surrendered himself to the arresting officer, and was sentenced to banishment.\n\nJust when he was preparing to leave, the King's concubine, Kim Gong-bin, fell critically ill with heart problems and none of the Imperial Doctors could cure her. In desperation, the King recalled Hur Jun, who cured Kim Gong-bin. To reward Hur Jun, the King absolved him of all crimes and wrongdoings, and assigned him to be the personal physician for Gong-bin.\n\nHowever, the King began to favor another concubine, and Gong-bin's condition deteriorated. Upon her death, Hur Jun decided to travel through the country for herbs and more uncured illnesses for several years. On his return, he hid in the imperial medical library to research and refine his skills.\n\nIn the meantime, Do-ji was steadily moving up through the ranks in the Imperial Hospital, and was prepared to take over the post of Chief Imperial Doctor. However, a prince of whom he was in charge developed a strange and serious illness. Not wishing to admit his mistake, which could have cost him his promotion, Do-ji decided to assign the prince to Hur Jun and let him take the blame. However, Hur Jun successfully treated the prince, for which the grateful King promoted Hur Jun to 3rd grade officer and Chief Imperial Doctor.\n\nA war soon broke out as the Japanese invaded Joseon. Hur Jun was credited for saving all the medical annals when the imperial court went into exile, and for reorganizing the Imperial Medical Annals after the war was over, for which Seonjo promoted him to first grade officer. A few years later, Hur Jun recommended to Seonjo to make all the Imperial Medical Annals available to the public, in an effort to make sure that all Joseon citizens could prevent illnesses before they happen.\n\nLater, an imperial battle between Prince Yeongchang and Prince Gwanghaegun began, and at first, Hur Jun refused to participate, reasoning that doctors should only treat patients and not get involved in politics. The conflict was ultimately won by Gwanghaegun, who ascended to the throne after Seonjo's death in 1608. Once installed as King, Gwanghaegun immediately branded Hur Jun a traitor since the law stated that if the king were to die of illness, the Chief Imperial Doctor would be responsible. However, Gwanghaegun thought that Hur Jun was a respectable doctor who had a lot of accomplishments including saving the queen's life, but since he could not go against the law, he lightened the punishment, and sentenced Hur Jun to exile in the Southern part of the country.\n\nIn the south, Hur Jun, with the help of imperial doctors who smuggled medical books to him, published a medical book, \"Dongui Bogam\" (Mirror of Eastern Medicine), in 1610; it is considered a classic among Oriental medicine literature.\n\nIn 1611, Gwanghaegun issued an imperial pardon to Hur Jun, and ordered him to return to the palace. This time, Hur Jun refused, and returned to his hometown to treat patients. At this time, a national plague epidemic began, and Hur Jun was called back to the Imperial Hospital to research a cure. The research was successful, but exhausted Hur Jun, who unknowingly contracted the plague himself and died in 1615, amid national mourning.\n\nWhen \"Hur Jun\" was broadcast in South Korea, it became a strong commercial success.\n\nWhen TVB bought \"Hur Jun\", the network had great hopes for its success, as it was a Korean drama aired immediately after the finale of \"Dae Jang Geum\", which had a successful run. However, viewers were not very receptive to the show, and its ratings were considerably lower than \"Dae Jang Geum\".\n\nThis has caused concern that the Korean Wave is ending, but many stated that the show had flat plots and generally uninteresting premise. Many cast members from \"Dae Jang Geum\" had been cast in \"Hur Jun\" in considerably different roles (e.g. the Emperor as a law enforcement official and Jang Geum's mentor as a palace chef), which earned a negative reaction from viewers outside of South Korea who were unaware that \"Hur Jun\" preceded \"Dae Jang Geum\" by a number of years.\n\nA remake, titled \"Hur Jun, The Original Story\" (in Korean, 구암 허준 \"Guam Heo Jun\"), was produced in 2013 and aired daily. Late actor Kim Joo-hyuk portrayed the titular doctor; Kim's late father Kim Mu-saeng had the role in 1975.\n\n"}

The group released two albums, an EP and several singles, and won a CASBY Award in 1985. \"The Pukka's\" were one of the most popular and influential bands in Toronto in the 80s.\nThe Pukka Orchestra was formed in Toronto in 1979. The band's name is derived from the Hindi word pukka, which means \"Genuine\", \"Authentic\", \"First Class\". The name was coined by Tony's extremely British grandfather who was the Harbour Master of Calcutta and later worked for Marconi. When Tony told him he was playing music for a living his grandfather replied, \"That's all very nice Tony, but don't bother with any mediocre bands, get yourself into a Pukka Orchestra\". The core of the band consisted of vocalist/guitarist/song writer Graeme Williamson and guitarists/co-songwriters Neil Chapman and Tony Duggan-Smith. The band made frequent use of numerous guest musicians which brings to mind the oft used phrase, \"Are you in the Pukka Orchestra? Why not, everyone else is.\".\n\nThe band released an independent single, \"Rubber Girl\", in 1981 (B side \"Do the Slither\") and Just after that they recorded \"Wonderful Time To Be Young\" and \"Spies Of The Heart\" with Danny Greenspoon at Inception Sound, all three making it on to the first album.\nThey performed regularly in Toronto's Queen Street West club scene, usually at The Bamboo, The Cameron House, The Horseshoe Tavern and Grossman's Tavern and signed to Solid Gold Records, releasing their self-titled debut album in 1984. In the summer of 1984, the band had a top 40 chart hit in Canada with a cover of Tom Robinson / Peter Gabriel's \"Listen to the Radio\". Other singles \"Cherry Beach Express\" and \"Might As Well Be on Mars\" received widespread FM radio play. The Toronto Police Service attempted to block radio airplay of \"Cherry Beach Express\" due to its themes of opposition to police brutality.\n\nThe band had just received a U-Know/CASBY Award for 'Most Promising Group' when they received two setbacks. Their record company Solid Gold went into receivership as the album was climbing the charts; then, while visiting relatives in Scotland in late 1984, Williamson developed kidney problems. Williamson ended up staying in a Glasgow hospital for several months, and in 1985, Chapman, Duggan-Smith, Robert Priest, Colin Linden, Gwen Swick and other Toronto musicians held a benefit concert at The Bamboo Club to help defray Williamson's living expenses while receiving dialysis treatment. He eventually received a kidney transplant and returned to Toronto. The band recorded a four-song EP called \"Palace of Memory\" in 1987. However, in the midst of recording their second full-length album in 1988, Williamson's health took another turn and he went back to Scotland for treatment.\n\nIn 1992, The Pukka Orchestra released their final album \"Dear Harry\", a compilation of three tracks from the 1987 EP, and completed tracks from the temporarily shelved 1988 sessions. The first Pukka Orchestra album was reissued in CD format in 2000 by Solid Gold Records/Casablanca Media.\n\nThe band regrouped, minus Williamson, for the Spirit of Radio Reunion show in 2003. \n\nThe three core members continue to work together from time to time and remain the best of friends.\n\n\n=Band Members=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America and some PAL regions. It was also re-released for Wii U Virtual Console on October 15, 2015 in Europe. It was a launch game for the system. \"Konami Krazy Racers\" makes use of a variety of characters and concepts from several of Konami's franchises, including \"Castlevania\", \"Metal Gear\", and \"Gradius\". It plays similarly to the \"Mario Kart\" series, with eight characters per circuit and offensive/defensive items placed at predetermined points in the tracks.\n\n\"Konami Krazy Racers\" received mostly positive reviews.\n\n\"Konami Krazy Racers\" plays similarly to other kart racing games, most notably \"Mario Kart Super Circuit\". Each race begins at the starting line, where eight racers are lined up in certain positions. Each of the seven computers are placed in the closest seven positions to the starting line, but the player character always starts a circuit in eighth place. This placement may change in the next race of the circuit depending on how well the racers do. If the player places first, he or she will be in the first position, as the placement in the following races is based on how the racers did in the previous race. The race is seen from behind the player, and uses Mode 7 effects to simulate the three dimensions. A timer will count down to indicate the beginning of the race, and the player must hold down a button to accelerate at the beginning. The player can pick up coins off of the track which may be spent on items in a shop, and depending on the character the player controls, he or she may try to cause another player to spin-out. The player may use other buttons to do such actions as jump and brake, which aides in maneuverability.\n\nPlaced throughout the races are red and blue bells. The red bells contain any variety of items, while the blue bell contains a speed-boosting item.\n\n\"Konami Krazy Racers\" features a total of 12 characters, each with unique features, including weight, speed, and acceleration.\n\n\nThe Game Boy Advance version received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 25 out of 40.\n\nThe GBA version was ranked #10 on a top ten list of the best Game Boy Advance games in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", beating \"\", another Game Boy Advance kart racing game.\n\n\"Krazy Kart Racing\" is a sequel to the title for iOS and Android, featuring a total of 12 characters from Konami franchises, including new ones not in the previous game.\n\n"}

It is a part of the Dhaka Division. It is bounded by the Padma River to its northeast. The district is named after the municipality of Faridpur. Historically, the town was known as Fatehabad. It was also called Haveli Mahal Fatehabad.\n\nThe town of Fatehabad was located by a stream known as the Dead Padma, which was from the main channel of the Padma River. Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah established a mint in Fatehabad during his reign in the early 15th century. Fatehabad continued to be a mint town of the Bengal Sultanate until 1538. In Ain-i-Akbari, it was named as \"Haweli Mahal Fatehabad\" during the reign of Emperor Akbar in the Mughal Empire. The Portuguese cartographer João de Barros mentioned it as \"Fatiabas\". The Dutch map of Van den Brouck described it as \"Fathur\".\n\nIts first mention in Bengali literature was by Daulat Uzir Bahram Khan in his adaption of Layla and Majnun. The medieval poet Alaol was born in Faridpur.\n\nFathabad was a strategically important base in south and southwestern Bengal. It was a well-developed urban centre. The town was home to important Mughal government officials, including generals, civil servants and jagirdars. During the reign of Emperor Jahangir in the 17th century, local zamindars Satrajit and Mukund resisted the Mughal government. By the 19th century, the town was renamed as Faridpur in honour of the Sufi saint Shah Fariduddin Masud, a follower of the Chishti order of Ajmer. Haji Shariatullah and Dudu Miyan led the conservative Faraizi movement in Faridpur during the early 19th century.\n\nThe Faridpur District was established by the British in 1815. The Faridpur Subdivision was a part of Dacca Division in the Bengal Presidency established by the East India Company. The municipality of Faridpur was established in 1869. The subdivision covered modern day Faridpur, Rajbari, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Gopalganj districts (collectively known as Greater Faridpur). It was included in Eastern Bengal and Assam during the British Raj between 1905 and 1912.\n\nFaridpur was a rail terminus for the Bengal Provincial Railway and the Eastern Bengal Railway, connecting Calcutta with the important Goalanda ghats, from where ships travelled to Colonial Assam and British Burma. British Faridpur was the birthplace of several nationalist leaders of the subcontinent, including Ambica Charan Mazumdar, Humayun Kabir, Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The acclaimed American engineer F R Khan was also born in the region.\n\nFaridpur saw intense fighting during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. It was one of original 18 subdivisions of Bangladesh at the time of independence. In 1984, the devolution reforms of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad divided the old subdivision into five districts. In 2015, the Government of Bangladesh announced plans to establish a Faridpur Division.\n\nThe district has 9 upazilas, 4 municipalities, 36 wards, 100 mahallahs, 79 unions and 1,899 villages. The district has four parliamentary constituencies in the Jatiyo Sangshad. The Faridpur District Council is the highest tier of local government.\n\nBelow is a list of the district's 9 upazilas:\n\n\nFaridpur is an important centre of the jute trade and hilsa fish trade. Its industrial sector features numerous jute mills, sugar mills and a 50 MW thermal power plant.\n\nIn terms of transport, Faridpur is an important hub of the Bangladesh Railway, with its tracks connected to the Indian Railway in West Bengal. It is linked by road with Kushtia, Meherpur, Khulna, Barisal, and Jessore.\n\nFaridpur District has a rich heritage of folk music, including Baul, Marami, Bichar, Murshidi-Marfati, Fakirali, Gazirgan, Kabigan, Jarigan music. However many of these traditions are extinct. Major festivals include Eid, Nabanna, Pous Utshab, Rathjatra, Dol Purnima Utshab and Durga Puja. Folk festivities are held on the occasion of Annaprashana, Muharram, Bengali weddings, Jamai Shasthi, Bhadra Mangal Chandi. Folk games of the district include Dariabandha, boat racing, Ha-du-du and cock fighting.\n\nMajor contemporary and historical publications include Jagaran, Ganaman (1370 BS), Chashi Barta, Idaning, Thikana, Bhorer Runner, Faridpur (1997), Kumar (2006); Weekly: Kalbhabna (2004), Pragotir Din (1995), Boalmari Sangbad, Al Helal, Bhanga Khabar; Fortnightly: Nazir Bangla Defunct: Faridpur Darpan (1861), Chitrakar (1283 BS), Kohinoor (1896), Sanjay (1900),' Aryakayastha (1318 BS), Faridpur Hitoishi (1329 BS), Faridpur Angina (1329 BS), Barta (1926), Muazzen (1335 BS), The Servant of Humanity (1960), Siraj (1932), Langal (1932), Sheba (1350 BS), Khedmat (1373 BS), Jubashakti (1972), Weekly Bangladesh (1972), Satyajug (1975), Faridpur Barta (1979), Aakal (1979), Samachar (1980) and Bangla Sangbad (1982).\n\nThere are several state owned colleges in the district. Several venerable British Raj-era educational institutions are located in the region, including the Rajendra College (1918), Govt. Saroda Sundori Mohila College, Faridpur (1966) Faridpur District School(1840), Govt. Girls High School, Faridpur (1910); George Academy (1911), Bakiganj Islamia Madrasa (1922), Hitoishi High School (1889), Bhanga Pilot High School (1889), Karakdi Rambihari Multilateral High School (1901) and Krishnapur High School (1910). The Faridpur Medical College was established in 1985.The Faridpur High School was established in 1889\n\n\n"}

It was first instituted on December 12, 1604 by King Henry IV's minister Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully. \n\nThe \"paulette\" was a tax on the holders of various government and judicial offices, paid to the Crown, and initially set at an annual payment of one-sixtieth of the value of each office. Paying the \"paulette\" secured the right of the officeholder to transfer his office at will.\n\nThe transmission of judicial offices had been a common practice in France since the late Middle Ages. By the beginning of the sixteenth century the practice had extended to almost all levels of the ever-increasing Renaissance state administration (such as seats in the \"Parlements\"), and played an important role in state finances. Custom had permitted an officer to transfer his office to his heir (\"résignation\") with royal permission in return for the payment of a fee. Before it was made illegal in 1521, it had been possible to leave open-ended the date that the transfer was to take effect. In 1534, the \"forty days rule\" was instituted (adapted from church practice), which made the successor's right void if the preceding office holder died within forty days of the transfer (in which case the office reverted to the state); however, a new fee, called the \"survivance jouissante\", protected against the forty days rule. Still, the new office holder had to meet the minimum qualifications needed for the office or else the office went back to the crown. The \"paulette\" was a modification of this rule, which substituted an annual tax as protection against the \"forty days rule\".\n\nThe \"paulette\" provided the Crown with a steady source of revenue while consolidating the practice of hereditary government offices. This left the administration of justice in France in the hands of a new and increasingly powerful hereditary class of magistrates, which came to be known as the \"noblesse de robe\" (\"nobility of the gown\"), in contrast with the traditional aristocracy, known as the \"noblesse d'épée\" (\"nobility of the sword\", whose position derived from feudal military service). This system was abolished after the French Revolution.\n\nWhile the \"paulette\" provided revenue for the Crown, the salaries of government officials stressed the royal funds and forced the Crown to tax the lower classes heavily. During the rule of Louis XIV, his minister of finance Jean Baptiste Colbert expanded the creation and sale of offices to raise money without new taxation.\n"}

{"id": "2250710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250710", "title": "Names of Myanmar", "text": "Names of Myanmar\n\n\"\"\n\nThe country known in English as both Myanmar and Burma has undergone changes in both its official and popular names worldwide. The choice of names stems from the existence of two different names for the country in Burmese, which are used in different contexts.\n\nThe official English name was changed by the country's government from the \"Union of Burma\" to the \"Union of Myanmar\" in 1989, and still later to the \"Republic of the Union of Myanmar\", which since then has been the subject of controversies and mixed incidences of adoption.\n\nIn the Burmese language Myanmar is known as either \"Myanma\" (မြန်မာ MLCTS: \"mranma\") or \"Bama\" (ဗမာ MLCTS: \"ba.ma\"). \"Myanma\" is the written, literary name of the country, while \"Bama\" is the spoken name of the country. Burmese, like Javanese and other languages of Southeast Asia, has different levels of register, with sharp differences between literary and spoken language.\n\nBoth names derive ultimately from the endonym of the largest ethnic group in Burma, the Bamar people, also known as \"Bama\" or \"Burmans\" in the spoken register and \"Mranma\" or \"Myanma\" in the literary register. As such, some groups—particularly non-Bamar minorities—consider one or other (or indeed both) names to be exclusionary.\n\nThe colloquial name \"Bama\" is supposed to have originated from the name \"Myanma\" by shortening of the first syllable, from loss of nasal final \"an\" (), reduced to non-nasal \"a\" (), and loss of \"y\" () glide), and then by transformation of \"m\" into \"b\". This sound change from \"m\" to \"b\" is frequent in colloquial Burmese and occurs in many other words. Although \"Bama\" \"may\" be a later transformation of the name \"Myanma\", both names have been in use alongside each other for centuries. King Mindon in the mid-19th century was the first to refer to himself as the king of the 'Myanma people', in an attempt to ethnicise his rule, at a time when his rule was largely confined to the Irrawaddy Valley and the \"Myanmar\" ethnic group.\n\nThe etymology of \"Mranma\" remains unclear. The \"Bamas\" who entered the central Irrawaddy river valley in the 9th century founded the Pagan Kingdom in 849, and called themselves Mranma. The earliest record discovered of the word was in a Mon inscription dated 1102, inside which the name was spelled \"Mirma\". The first record of the name in a Burmese inscription is dated 1190, in which inscription the name was spelled \"Mranma\".\n\nMa Thanegi records that the first use of the name 'Mranma' for the country is to be found on a high stone inscription dated 597 ME (Traditional Burmese calendar) or 1235 CE. The stone is from the reign of Kyaswa, (1234-1250) son of King Htilominlo (Nadaungmya), Bagan. It is written in early Burmese script. Although the middle of the front side of this stone is damaged, the first line of the better-protected reverse side clearly shows မြန်မာပြည် (\"Mranma kingdom\"). The inscription is known as the 'Yadana Kon Htan Inscription'. At present it is in Bagan recorded as stone number 43 in the Archaeological Department's collection.\n\nToday in Burmese the name is still spelled \"Mranma\", but over time the \"r\" sound disappeared in most dialects of the Burmese language and was replaced by a \"y\" glide, so although the name is spelled \"Mranma\", it is actually pronounced \"Myanma\".\n\nIn the decades preceding independence, independence parties were in search of a name for the new country to be born, which would be made up not only of Burmese-speaking people, but also of many minorities. In the 1920s, some favoured the name \"Myanma\", which had been the name applied to the old Burmese kingdom subjugated by the British in the 19th century. In the 1930s, the left-wing independence parties favoured the name \"Bama\", as they thought this name was more inclusive of minorities than \"Myanma\".\n\nThe Burmese puppet state set up by the Japanese occupation forces during the Second World War was officially called \"Bama\". When the Japanese used their own syllabary, they transliterated the three consonants of the Dutch name \"Birma\" and ended up with the name Biruma (ビルマ). At the time of independence in 1948, the \"Union of Burma\" was the name that was chosen for the new country, being further amended as the \"Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\" in 1974, following a 1962 military coup.\n\nWhile both the names \"Bama\" and \"Myanma\" historically referred only to the Burmans and not other ethnic minorities, Burmese governments in the post-independence period have instituted a differentiation of meaning between Myanmar and Bamar in the official Burmese language usage. The name Myanma/Myanmar was expanded to include all citizens of the country while the name Bama/Bamar was kept to its original meaning. Both are widespread use in colloquial usage. Most still use Bamar/Myanmar interchangeably, to refer to the country, depending on the context. Ironically, because of the official renaming of the country, the dominant ethnic group is now known by its colloquial name, \"Bamar\", rather than by its literary name, \"Myanmar\" in official Burmese usage.\n\nIn English, the official name chosen for the country at the time of independence was \"Burma\". This was already the name that the British called their colony before 1948. This name most likely comes from Portuguese \"Birmania\" and was adopted by English in the 18th century. The Portuguese name itself came from the Indian name \"Barma\" which was borrowed by the Portuguese from any of the Indian languages in the 16th or 17th century. This Indian name \"Barma\" may derive from colloquial Burmese \"Bama\", but it may also derive from the Indian name \"Brahma-desh.\"\n\nEarly usage of the English term Burma varies:\n\nIn 1989, the military regime of Burma set up a commission in charge of reviewing the place names of Burma in the English language. The aim of the commission was to correct the spelling of the place names of Burma in English, to discard spellings chosen by British colonial authorities in the 19th century, and adopt spellings closer to the actual Burmese pronunciation (compare with what happened in India with Calcutta/Kolkata and Calicut/Kozhikode). These renamings took the form of the \"Adaptation of Expressions Law\", passed on 18 June 1989. Thus, for instance, Rangoon was changed to Yangon to reflect the fact that the \"r\" sound is no longer used in Standard Burmese and merged with a \"y\" glide.\n\nAs for the country's name, the commission decided to replace the English name \"Burma\" with \"Myanmar\", for three reasons. First, \"Myanma\" is the official name of the country in the Burmese language, and the aim of the commission was to have English place names aligned with Burmese place names and pronunciation. Second, the commission thought that the name \"Myanma\" was more inclusive of minorities than the name \"Bama\", and wanted the English name of the country to reflect this. Finally, the military regime has long been suspicious of the colloquial Burmese language, which it perceives as subversive; the English name \"Burma\" mirrors the colloquial Burmese name \"Bama\".\n\nThe final \"r\" in the English \"Myanmar\" is absent in Burmese \"Myanma\" (much as the medial \"r\" in \"Burma\" is absent in standard Burmese \"Bama\"). The commission added a final \"r\" in English to represent the low tone of Burmese, in which the word \"Myanma\" is pronounced. In the low tone, the final vowel \"a\" is lengthened. The commission was influenced by Received Pronunciation and other non-rhotic English English dialects, in which \"ar\" (without a following vowel) is also pronounced as long \"a\" (often given as \"ah\" in American English). However, in variants of English in which final \"r\" is pronounced, such as standard American English, adding this final \"r\" leads to a pronunciation very different from the Burmese pronunciation.\n\nIn the Burmese language, there have been controversies about the name of the country since the 1930s, and the decision of the regime in 1989 carried the controversy into the English language. The regime believes that \"Myanma\" is more inclusive of minorities than \"Bama\", while opponents point out that historically, \"Myanma\" is only a more literary version of \"Bama\".\n\nQuite the opposite of being more inclusive, opposition parties and human rights groups contend that the new English name \"Myanmar\" is actually disrespectful of the minorities of Burma. Minorities, many of whom do not speak Burmese, had become accustomed to the English name \"Burma\" over the years, and they perceive the new name \"Myanmar\" as a purely Burmese name reflecting the policy of domination of the ethnic Burman majority over the minorities.\n\nThe regime changed the name of the country in English; it did not change the official name of the country in Burmese. Former opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi at first opposed the new name \"Myanmar\", pointing out the hypocritical justification of inclusivity put forward by the regime. Opposition parties, although they oppose the English name \"Myanmar\", do not oppose the official Burmese name \"Myanma\", and no opposition party is proposing to use the colloquial name \"Bama\" as the official name of the country. Culturally, when speaking, locals refer to the country as Burma, but in literature, it is named \"Myanmar\". \n\nFinally, a lot of criticism also focused on the lack of linguistic soundness of the reform. Only four language scholars sat in the 1989 commission, while the majority of the commission was made up of military officials and civil servants with no particular knowledge of linguistics. The new names adopted often lacked serious linguistic credibility, and some appear questionable (the final \"r\" at the end of the name Myanmar makes sense only for a speaker of a non-rhotic dialect of English).\n\nSince the 1989 decision to change the English name from \"Burma\" to \"Myanmar\", adoption of the new name in the English-speaking world has been mixed. Use of \"Burma\", along with many other name changes within the Myanmar has remained widespread, largely based on the question of whether the regime has the legitimacy to change the country's name, particularly without a referendum.\n\nThe United Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, endorsed the name change five days after its announcement. However, the United States and the United Kingdom still refer to the country as \"Burma\". The United States government attributes its choice to support for the party deemed to have won the 1990 election, but been denied power by the junta. That party opposes the new name.\n\nFollowing the 2011–2012 democratic reforms in Burma, politicians started using \"Myanmar\" more frequently. The British government also cites the elected party's preference in its statement on its choice of name. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canada said that his government's choice was \"in support of the struggle for democracy\". Others, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the governments of China, India, Japan, Germany, Australia, Canada and Russia recognize \"Myanmar\" as the official name.\n\nDuring the 2005 ASEAN summit in Thailand, the Foreign Minister Nyan Win complained about the US insistence of calling his country \"Burma\" instead of \"Myanmar\" as it was renamed more than a decade ago. In January 2011, during the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the country at the United Nations, the delegate of Myanmar interrupted the delegate of the United States, who had begun her comments on human rights in Myanmar by \"welcom[ing] the Burmese delegation to the UPR working group\". Myanmar's delegate insisted that the American delegation should use the name \"Myanmar\", and appealed to the session's president to enforce that rule. The latter commented that \"we're here to discuss human rights in Myanmar, we're not here to discuss the name of the country\", and asked the American delegation to use Myanmar's official, UN-recognised name. The American delegate continued her comments on human rights violations in Myanmar, without using either name for the country. On 19 November 2012, US President Barack Obama, accompanied by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her second visit to the country, referred to the nation as both Myanmar and Burma.\n\nMedia usage is also mixed. In spite of the usage by the US government, American news outlets including \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", The \"International Herald Tribune\" and CNN, and US-based international news agencies the Associated Press and Reuters have adopted the name \"Myanmar\". Others have continued to use \"Burma\", some of whom have switched to using \"Myanmar\" years after the name change, such as the \"Financial Times\", citing increasing international acceptance of the new name. The BBC changed to using \"Myanmar\" in 2014.\n\nSome other sources, including NPR in the US use terms such as \"Myanmar, also known as Burma\".\n\nAnother approach taken by some historians is to continue to use the name \"Burma\" for describing the history of the country prior to the 1988 military coup and \"Myanmar\" from there on. This also contravenes the intentions of the government, whose naming reform in 1989 was to apply to the entire history of the country. Those using this approach argue that it is the most politically neutral option.\n\nIn June 2014, the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, continued a long-running discussion on the manner in which Australian officials would refer to the Southeast Asian nation. While Burma was the formal title used by the Australian government, the Labor government revised the national name to the Union of Myanmar in 2012. However, the matter has resurfaced, as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) reverted to the former title under Abbott's leadership in late 2013. A reason for the change has not appeared in the media, but, as of June 2014, the Abbott government's policy advises officials to switch between Burma and Myanmar, in accordance with the circumstances at hand. DFAT secretary Peter Varghese explained to the media: \"Our ambassador to Myanmar would be our ambassador to Myanmar, because the country to which she Brontë Moules is accredited is Myanmar, in the eyes of the government of Myanmar.\"\n\nIn April 2016, soon after taking office, Aung San Suu Kyi clarified that foreigners are free to use either name, \"because there is nothing in the constitution of our country that says that you must use any term in particular\".\n\nIn Burmese, the word \"Myanma\", when used as a noun, is pronounced in the low tone (long \"a\", Okell: \"Myañma/Myăma\"), whereas when used as an adjective, it is pronounced in the creaky tone (short \"a\") as if it were spelt \"မြန်မ\" or \"မြန်မာ့\" (MLCTS: \"mranma.\", Okell: \"Myañmá/Myămá\"). To reflect this, in the 1989 government renaming the adjectival form of the country's name \"Myanmar\" is formed by dropping the final \"r\" to get \"Myanma\" (since the final \"r\" indicates lengthening in Oxford English).\n\nMost people, even in Burma, are unaware of these subtleties, as it occurs only in the spoken language and . Thus we find both \"Myanma Airways\" (correct spelling) and \"Myanmar Airways\" (incorrect spelling, but used officially and recognised anyway). Some English speakers have even coined the adjective \"Myanmarese\" or \"Myanmese\", to follow English rather than Burmese grammatical rules. These adjectives are not recommended as most natives of Myanmar preferred to be called either the old way of \"Burmese\", \"Myanmar\", or \"Myanma\" representing the many diverse races in the country.\n\nAccording to the renaming, the name of the dominant ethnicity of Burma, whose people speak the Burmese language, is \"Bamar\" (again, final \"r\" only added to denote a long \"a\" in Burmese). Thus, \"Myanmar\" is a country inhabited by the \"Bamars\" plus many minorities; and the \"Bamars\" and minorities are collectively known as \"Myanma\" people.\n\nWhile use of the name \"Myanmar\" is widespread and rivals the use of \"Burma\", adoption of adjectival forms has been far more limited; in general, terms in use before 1989 have persisted. Citizens of Burma, regardless their ethnicity, are known as \"Burmese\", while the dominant ethnicity is called \"Burman\". The language of the Burmans, however, is known as the Burmese language, not as the Burman language, although confusingly enough the \"Burmese\" language is considered one of the Tibeto-\"Burman\" languages.\n\nIn Assamese the country is known as মান দেশ (Maan dex) since the time when the 1st Ahom king Sukapha crossed Patkai hills to come to Assam valley from Myanmar. The period of Burmese invasions to Assam are known as মানৰ দিন (Maanor din) ie Days of Maan.\n\nIn Chinese, the name appeared for the first time in 1273 and was recorded as 緬 (pronounced \"Miǎn\" in Mandarin). The present name in the Chinese is 緬甸 (pronounced Miǎndiàn). The Vietnamese (\"Miến Điện\") is derived from the same term.\n\nIn Japan, although the Japanese government's basic position is to use , often media organisations indicate in parentheses afterwards. \"Biruma\" may be used more often in the spoken language, while \"Myanmā\" is more common in written language. Popular Japanese fictional works such as \"The Burmese Harp\" (\"Biruma no tategoto\") mean that the name \"Biruma\" may have more of an emotional resonance to readers. Historically Japan used the Chinese characters of \"Menden\" (緬甸) to refer to Burma. This form remains in contemporary usage in abbreviations; for example, the World War II-era Burma-Thailand Railway is still referred to almost exclusively as the \"Tai-Men Tetsudō\" (泰緬鉄道).\n\nThe Indian (and sometimes used in Bangladesh) name for Myanmar is \"'Brahmadesh' or 'Brahmavarta\"' (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मादेश/ब्रह्मावर्त) which means 'land of Brahma'.\n\n"}

Located in Naica in the municipality of Saucillo, the Naica Mine is owned by Industrias Peñoles, the world's largest silver producer. Caverns discovered during mining operations contain crystals of selenite (gypsum) as large as in diameter and long. Peñoles announced in October 2015 that it was indefinitely suspending operations due to uncontrollable flooding at the Naica Mine.\n\nThe peak underground temperature is 58° C (136° F) with 99% humidity, which interferes with breathing and increases the risk of asphyxiation. Because of the heat, unprotected researchers can only stay up to 10 min inside the cave. Longer visits require the use of a specialized suit with an oxygen supply.\n\nThe Cave of Crystals is a cave approximately below the surface in the limestone host rock of the mine. The chamber contains giant selenite crystals, some of the largest natural crystals ever found.\nThe selenite crystals were formed by hydrothermal fluids emanating from the magma chambers below. The cavern was discovered while the miners were drilling through a newly drained area. The caves are closed to the public, and remain closed after a worker tried to enter the cave to steal some of the selenite, only to suffocate and die in the cave's humid and inhospitable atmosphere. After enough research on the crystals has been carried out, some of the chambers will be allowed to flood again and continue the process of crystal growth.\n\nThe Cave of Swords is another chamber in the Naica Mine, also containing gypsum crystals but each \"only\" about a meter long, due to the fact that these crystals are younger and had been growing for much less time by the time they were discovered in 1910.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. KTNV-TV's studios are located on South Valley View Boulevard in the nearby unincorporated community of Paradise (though with a Las Vegas mailing address), and its transmitter is located atop Mount Arden in Henderson.\n\nThe station, originally owned by the TV Company of America, Inc., signed on the air for the first time on May 4, 1956 as KSHO-TV. Before then, ABC had been relegated to off-hours clearances on NBC affiliate KLRJ/KORK-TV (channel 3, now KSNV-DT) and CBS affiliate KLAS-TV (channel 8).\n\nIn 1979, KSHO was purchased by WTMJ, Inc., the broadcasting division of The Journal Company; the acquisition made it Journal's second television station property (and its first television station acquisition outside of the company's headquarters of Milwaukee). The station changed its callsign to KTNV-TV on March 2, 1980 (the -TV suffix was removed from 1988 to 2009).\n\nKTNV originally transmitted its signal from a tower located right outside the station at the intersection of Desert Inn Road and Valley View Boulevard, on the quadruple border of city of Las Vegas, Spring Valley, Paradise and Winchester, before relocating later to Potosi Mountain and then to its current site on Arden Peak. The tower is a unique and visible landmark throughout the Las Vegas Valley.\n\nOn July 30, 2014, it was announced that the E. W. Scripps Company would buy Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. Scripps will retain the two companies' broadcast properties, including KTNV, and spin off its print properties as part of Journal Media Group. The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014. It was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015. The merger was completed on April 1, 2015. With new sister station KNXV-TV in Phoenix, along with existing Tucson sister KGUN-TV, this effectively gives Scripps a monopoly for ABC network programming across the wide geographical area of Southern Nevada and most of the state of Arizona.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKTNV-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 12 to channel 13 for post-transition operations. As with all of Journal Communications' television stations, the station also added the \"-TV\" suffix to its callsign following the transition to become KTNV-TV.\n\nCurrently, KTNV-TV is not airing \"America This Morning\" due to looping \"World News Now\" until the start of the 4:30 morning newscast. Outside of the ABC network schedule, syndicated programming on KTNV-TV includes \"Judge Judy\", \"Inside Edition\", and \"Right This Minute\".\n\nOver the past several years, KTNV has been phasing out syndicated programming and replacing it with either news, or more recently, self-produced lifestyle programming. Most notably in 2004, KTNV lost \"Oprah\" to rival CBS affiliate KLAS-TV, replacing it with a half-hour 4 p.m. newscast and syndicated programming; and in 2009, KTNV declined to renew the local rights to the syndicated morning talk show \"Live with Regis and Kelly\" (replacing it with the \"Morning Blend\"). On March 5, 2012, the 4 p.m. newscast was moved back to 3:30, in order to make room for \"Judge Judy\" (which it acquired from KSNV-DT) in the newscast's former timeslot.\n\nFollowing the lead of many Journal stations, KTNV launched a lifestyle-oriented program called \"The Morning Blend\" on July 6, 2010. The program, which airs at 9 a.m. on weekdays and is hosted by Dao Vu and Shawn Tempesta, is modeled after the format of Milwaukee sister station (and Journal Broadcast Group flagship) WTMJ-TV's morning program of the same name, and features a mix of paid and unpaid segments. All segments that promote a certain product or company are clearly disclaimed on air. The show is produced through KTNV's sales and advertising departments, with no connection at all to the station's news department. As such, \"The Morning Blend\"s hosts do not report any news stories, ceding any breaking events to the KTNV news staff, and the show is preempted in occasional cases where breaking news coverage takes up the entire hour.\n\nKTNV-TV presently broadcasts a total of 43 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 5½ hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the second-largest local newscast output among Las Vegas' broadcast television stations, behind Fox affiliate KVVU-TV (channel 5)'s 53 hours of newscasts each week. In years past, the station's newscasts have been called \"News 13\", \"Channel 13 News\", \"News 13 Inside Las Vegas\" and \"13 Inside Las Vegas\"; the station switched to the current \"Action News\" branding for its newscasts in 2003.\n\nOn December 15, 2007, KTNV became the third television station in Las Vegas (behind KVBC, channel 3 and KLAS-TV, channel 8) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The station also unveiled its new digital production facilities and news set on the same day.\n\nOn July 20, 2016, KTNV switched to the current Scripps graphics and news theme \"Inergy.\"\n\nKTNV's signal is relayed throughout portions of Nevada and Arizona on the following translator stations:\n"}

Her father is Ravi Shankar, her mother is Sukanya Rajan. She is the half-sister of Norah Jones.\n\nAnoushka was born in London and her childhood was divided between London and Delhi. She is the daughter of Sukanya Shankar and Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who was 61 when she was born. Through her father, she is also the half-sister of American singer Norah Jones (born Geetali Norah Shankar), and Shubhendra \"Shubho\" Shankar, who died in 1992.\n\nAs a teenager, Anoushka lived in Encinitas, California, and attended San Dieguito High School Academy. A 1999 honors graduate and Homecoming Queen, Anoushka decided to pursue a career in music rather than attend college.\n\nAnoushka began training on the sitar with her father Ravi at the age of seven. As part of her training, she began accompanying him on the tanpura at his performances from the age of ten, soaking up the music and becoming acclimated to the stage. Anoushka gave her first public sitar performance on 27 February 1995 at the age of 13, at Siri Fort in New Delhi as part of her father's 75th birthday celebration concert. For this solo debut, she was accompanied by tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. Her first experience in the recording studio came that same year when Angel Records released a special four-CD box set called \"In Celebration\", to mark her father's birthday. By the age of fourteen, she was accompanying her father at concerts around the world. At fifteen, she assisted her father on the landmark album \"Chants of India\", produced by George Harrison. Under both their guidance, she was in charge of notation and eventually of conducting the performers who took part in the record. After this experience, the heads of Angel Records came to her parents' home to ask to sign her, and Anoushka signed her first exclusive recording contract with Angel/EMI when she was sixteen.\n\nShe released her first album, \"Anoushka\", in 1998, followed by \"Anourag\" in 2000. In 1999 Shankar graduated from high school with honors, but decided against university in favour of beginning to tour as a solo artist. Both Shankar and her half-sister Norah Jones were nominated for Grammy awards in 2003 when Anoushka became the youngest-ever and first woman nominee in the World Music category for her third album, \"Live at Carnegie Hall\".\n\nHaving released three albums of Indian classical music, Anoushka took several years away from recording and focused her energy on establishing herself as a solo concert performer outside of her father's ensemble. In that time, she toured worldwide, playing an average of 50–60 concerts per year. 2005 brought the release of her fourth album \"RISE\", her first self-produced, self-composed, non-classical album, earning her another Grammy nomination in the Best Contemporary World Music category. In February 2006 she became the first Indian to play at the Grammy Awards, playing material from \"RISE\".\n\nShankar, in collaboration with Karsh Kale, released \"Breathing Under Water\" on 28 August 2007. It is a mix of classical sitar and electronica beats and melodies. Notable guest vocals included her paternal half-sister Norah Jones, Sting, and her father, who performed a sitar duet with her.\n\nIn 2011 Shankar signed with record label Deutsche Grammophon as an exclusive artist. This marked the beginning of a prolific recording and creative period for Shankar, during which time she continued to refine the sitar sound and musical ideas she had become known for. She earned a third Grammy Award nomination in 2013 for \"Traveller\", an exploration of the shared history between flamenco and Indian classical music, which was produced by Javier Limón and featured artists such as Buika, Pepe Habichuela and Duquende. As Shankar had begun to do with \"Rise\", she created a specially handpicked ensemble of musicians with whom to perform this cross-genre music, and played over a hundred concerts worldwide in support of \"Traveller\". In 2013 she released a personal album called \"Traces of You\", which was released several months after the passing of her father Ravi Shankar. Produced by Nitin Sawhney, and featuring her half-sister Norah Jones as the sole vocal performer, \"Traces of You\" earned Shankar a fourth Grammy nomination in the World Music category. In July 2015 Shankar released \"Home\", her first purely classical album of Indian Ragas. Self-composed and produced, Home was recorded over a week in October 2014 in Shankar's new, purpose-built home-studio.\nShankar has made many guest appearances on recordings by other artists, among them Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Thievery Corporation and Nitin Sawhney. Recently, Shankar has collaborated with Herbie Hancock on his latest record \"The Imagine Project\", and with Rodrigo y Gabriela on their album \"Area 52\".\n\nDuets with artists such as violinist Joshua Bell, in a sitar-cello duet with Mstislav Rostropovich, and with flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal, playing both sitar and piano, Shankar has championed her father's compositions. Shankar is also the sole performer of Ravi Shankar's 1st and 2nd Concertos for Sitar and Orchestra, performing multiple times under legendary conductors such as Zubin Mehta. In January 2009 she was the sitar soloist alongside the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra premiering her father's 3rd Concerto for Sitar and Orchestra, and in July 2010 she premiered Ravi Shankar's first symphony for sitar and orchestra with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at London's Royal Festival Hall.\n\nIn April 2016, Shankar performed with violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja during a concert in Konzerthaus Berlin, Germany. The \"Raga Piloo\" was originally composed, performed and recorded by Ravi Shankar as a duet with Yehudi Menuhin on the album \"West Meets East, Volume 2\" in 1968.\n\nShankar has also ventured into acting (\"Dance Like a Man\", 2004) and writing. She wrote a biography of her father, \"\", in 2002 and has contributed to various books. As a columnist she wrote monthly columns for India's \"First City Magazine\" for three years, and spent one year as a weekly columnist for India's second largest newspaper, the \"Hindustan Times\".\n\nOn 29 November 2002, Shankar was the featured performer of the \"Indian\" half of the Concert for George, a posthumous tribute to the life and music of George Harrison, held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She opened the show by playing a solo sitar instrumental titled \"Your Eyes\". Also on the sitar, she performed George Harrison's \"The Inner Light\" with Jeff Lynne. Lastly, she conducted a new composition, \"Arpan\", written by her father. The composition featured Eric Clapton playing acoustic guitar, and a full orchestra of Indian and Western musicians. The concert was modelled after Ravi Shankar's benefit concert with Harrison, the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh.\n\nShankar was invited by Richard Gere and Philip Glass to perform in a concert at Avery Fisher Hall in 2003 in aid of the Healing the Divide: A Concert for Peace and Reconciliation.\nShankar and Jethro Tull postponed a concert scheduled for 29 November 2008 in Mumbai after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. They reorganised the performance as A Billion Hands Concert, a benefit performance for victims of the attacks, and held it on 5 December 2008. Shankar commented on this decision stating that: \"As a musician, this is how I speak, how I express the anger within me [...] our entire tour has been changed by these events and even though the structure of the concert may remain the same, emotionally perhaps we are saying a lot more.\"\n\n\nShankar is a supporter of animal rights. She and her father appeared in a thirty-second public-service announcement against animal suffering for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Anoushka is also the spokesperson for the United Nations World Food Programme in India.\n\nIn 2013, responding to the horrific gang-rape of a young girl in Delhi, whom the Indian media referred to as Nirbhaya, Shankar threw her weight behind an online campaign One Billion Rising on Change.org, demanding an end to crime against women. As part of the campaign, she released a video in which she revealed she had been sexually abused for many years as a child.\n\nShankar grew up in the US, the UK, and India. In 2010 she married British director Joe Wright. They had two sons and then divorced in 2018. She lives in London with her two sons.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250738", "title": "Common value auction", "text": "Common value auction\n\nIn common value auctions the value of the item for sale is identical amongst bidders, but bidders have different information about the item's value. This stands in contrast to a private value auction where each bidder's private valuation of the item is different and independent of peers' valuations.\n\nA classic example of a pure common values auction is when a jar full of quarters is auctioned off. The jar will be worth the same amount to anyone. However, each bidder has a different guess about how many quarters are in the jar. Other, real-life examples include Treasury bill auctions, initial public offerings, spectrum auctions, very prized paintings, art pieces, antiques etc.\n\nOne important phenomenon occurring in common value auctions is the winner's curse. Bidders have only estimates of the value of the good. If, on average, bidders are estimating correctly, the highest bid will tend to have been placed by someone who overestimated the good's value. This is an example of adverse selection, similar to the classic \"lemons\" example of Akerlof. Rational bidders will anticipate the adverse selection, so that even though their information will still turn out to have been overly optimistic when they win, they do not pay too much on average.\n\nSometimes the term winner's curse is used differently, to refer to cases in which naive bidders ignore the adverse selection and bid sufficiently more than a fully rational bidder would that they actually pay more than the good is worth. This usage is prevalent in the experimental economics literature, in contrast with the theoretical and empirical literatures on auctions.\n\nCommon-value auctions and private-value auctions are two extremes. Between these two extremes are interdependent value auctions (also called: affiliated value auctions), where bidder's valuations (e.g., formula_1) can have a common value component (formula_2) and a private value (formula_3) component. The two components can be correlated so that one bidder's private valuation can influence another bidder's valuation. These types of auctions comprise most real-world auctions and are sometimes confusingly referred to as common value auctions also.\n\nIn the following examples, a common-value auction is modeled as a Bayesian game. We try to find a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), which is a function from the information held by a player, to the bid of that player. We focus on a \"symmetric\" BNE (SBNE), in which all bidders use the same function.\n\nThe following example is based on.\n\nThere are two bidders participating in a first-price sealed-bid auction for an object that has either high quality (value V) or low quality (value 0) to both of them. Each bidder receives a signal that can be either high or low, with probability 1/2. The signal is related to the true value as follows:\nThis game has no SBNE in pure-strategies.\n\nPROOF: Suppose that there was such an equilibrium \"b\". This is a function from a signal to a bid, i.e., a player with signal \"x\" bids \"b\"(\"x\"). Clearly \"b\"(low)=0, since a player with low signal knows with certainty that the true value is 0 and does not want to pay anything for it. Also, \"b\"(high) ≤ V, otherwise there will be no gain in participation. Suppose bidder 1 has \"b1\"(high)=B1 > 0. We are searching the best-response for bidder 2, \"b2\"(high)=B2. There are several cases:\nThe latter expression is positive only when B2 < V/2. But in that case, the expression in #3 is larger than the expression in #2: it is always better to bid slightly more than the other bidder. This means that there is no symmetric equilibrium.\n\nThis result is in contrast to the private-value case, where there is always a SBNE (see first-price sealed-bid auction).\n\nThe following example is based on.\n\nThere are two bidders participating in a second-price sealed-bid auction for an object. Each bidder \"i\" receives signal \"si\"; the signals are independent and have continuous uniform distribution on [0,1]. The valuations are:\nwhere formula_5 are constants (formula_6 means private values; formula_7 means common values).\n\nHere, there is a unique SBNE in which each player bids:\n\nThis result is in contrast to the private-value case, where in SBNE each player truthfully bids his value (see second-price sealed-bid auction).\n\nThis example is suggested as an explanation to jump bidding in English auctions.\n\nTwo bidders, Xenia and Yakov, participate in an auction for a single item. The valuations depend on A B and C -- three independent random variables drawn from a continuous uniform distribution on the interval [0,36]:\n\nBelow we consider several auction formats and find a SBNE in each of them. For simplicity we look for SBNE in which each bidder bids formula_12 times his/her signal: Xenia bids formula_13 and Yakov bids formula_14. We try to find the value of formula_12 in each case.\n\nIn a sealed-bid second-price auction, there is a SBNE with formula_16, i.e., each bidder bids exactly his/her signal.\n\nPROOF: The proof takes the point-of-view of Xenia. We assume that she knows that Yakov bids formula_17, but she does not know formula_18. We find the best response of Xenia to Yakov's strategy. Suppose Xenia bids formula_19. There are two cases:\nAll in all, Xenia's expected gain (given her signal X) is: \nwhere formula_24 is the conditional probability-density of Y given X.\n\nBy the Fundamental theorem of calculus, the derivative of this expression as a function of Z is just formula_25. This is zero when formula_26. So, the best response of Xenia is to bid formula_27.\n\nIn a symmetric BNE, Xenia bids formula_28. Comparing the latter two expressions implies that formula_16.\n\nThe expected auctioneer's revenue is:\n\nIn a Japanese auction, the outcome is the same as in the second-price auction, since information is revealed only when one of the bidders exits, but in this case the auction is over. So each bidder exits at his observation.\n\nIn the above example, in a first-price sealed-bid auction, there is a SBNE with formula_33, i.e., each bidder bids 2/3 of his/her signal.\n\nPROOF: The proof takes the point-of-view of Xenia. We assume that she knows that Yakov bids formula_17, but does not know formula_18. We find the best response of Xenia to Yakov's strategy. Suppose Xenia bids formula_19. There are two cases:\nAll in all, Xenia's expected gain (given her signal X and her bid Z) is: \nwhere formula_24 is the conditional probability-density of Y given X.\n\nSince formula_42, the conditional probability-density of Y is:\n\nSubstituting this into the above formula gives that the gain of Xenia is:\nThis has a maximum when formula_48. But, since we want a symmetric BNE, we also want to have formula_28. These two equalities together imply that formula_50.\n\nThe expected auctioneer's revenue is:\n\nNote that here, the revenue equivalence principle does NOT hold—the auctioneer's revenue is lower in a first-price auction than in a second-price auction (revenue-equivalence holds only when the values are independent).\n\nCommon-value auctions are comparable to Bertrand competition. Here, the firms are the bidders and the consumer is the auctioneer. Firms \"bid\" prices up to but not exceeding the true value of the item. Competition among firms should drive out profit. The number of firms will influence the success or otherwise of the auction process in driving price towards true value. If the number of firms is small, collusion may be possible.

It has been used by critics of monetarism and economic liberalism to refer to the thesis that a policy model of the Thatcher government, distinct from one-nation conservatism, was resurrected when Blair came to power. It echoed \"Butskellism\", frequently used to describe the post-war consensus on a mixed economy with moderate state intervention to promote social goals, particularly in education and health.\n\nEditorial comment by \"Red Pepper\" before the 1997 general election that brought Blair to power may be the earliest usage. Another early sighting of this term was in 2001, used by Brian Lee Crowley, a Canadian commentator. The term has also been used, for example, by the journalist Alexander Cockburn in preference to Blairism.\n\nBlatcherism can be defined as an emphasis on free market policies, support for privatisation or the private ownership of former public services, a monetarist/neo-classical economic policy and a retention of anti-trade union legislation. A convergence of such policies between the Labour and Conservative parties first emerged when Blair became leader of the Labour Party. Blair was elected Leader of the Labour Party in July 1994 following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party abandoned many policies it had held for decades and embraced many of the measures enacted during Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister, including the Building Societies (deregulation) Act of 1986. In conjunction with Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown and Alastair Campbell, Blair created the New Labour ethos by embracing many aspects of Thatcherite beliefs into Labour as the \"Third Way\".\n\nThe term is also used as shorthand by Ye. V. Ananyeva (\"On Modern Ways of Reformism, or On Reformism as Modern Way\", \"Polis Journal\"), according to whom Blatcherism is currently \"personified by T. Blair\", has \"substituted for the previous postwar political consensus\" and is \"consensual\" with \"neoconservatism as embodied in Thatcherism\" in the approach to a solution to Britain's modernisation problems.\n\n"}

In 1911, the family lived in Salford, Lancashire.\n\nShe appeared as Maggie Hobson in the David Lean film version of \"Hobson's Choice\" (1954) with John Mills and Charles Laughton, set in Salford.

{"id": "2250747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250747", "title": "Iodomethane", "text": "Iodomethane\n\nIodomethane, also called methyl iodide, and commonly abbreviated \"MeI\", is the chemical compound with the formula CHI. It is a dense, colorless, volatile liquid. In terms of chemical structure, it is related to methane by replacement of one hydrogen atom by an atom of iodine. It is naturally emitted by rice plantations in small amounts. It is also produced in vast quantities estimated to be greater than 214,000 tons annually by algae and kelp in the world's temperate oceans, and in lesser amounts on land by terrestrial fungi and bacteria. It is used in organic synthesis as a source of methyl groups.\n\nIodomethane is formed via the exothermic reaction that occurs when iodine is added to a mixture of methanol with red phosphorus. The iodinating reagent is phosphorus triiodide that is formed \"in situ:\"\n\nAlternatively, it is prepared from the reaction of dimethyl sulfate with potassium iodide in the presence of calcium carbonate:\n\nIodomethane can also be prepared by the reaction of methanol with aqueous hydrogen iodide:\nThe generated iodomethane can be distilled from the reaction mixture.\n\nIodomethane may also be prepared by treating iodoform with potassium hydroxide and dimethyl sulfate under 95% ethanol.\n\nLike many organoiodide compounds, iodomethane is typically stored in dark bottles to inhibit degradation caused by light to give iodine, giving degraded samples a purplish tinge. Commercial samples may be stabilized by copper or silver wire. It can be purified by washing with NaSO to remove iodine followed by distillation.\n\nMost iodomethane is produced by microbial methylation of iodide. Oceans are the major source, but rice paddies are also significant.\n\nIodomethane is an excellent substrate for S2 substitution reactions. It is sterically open for attack by nucleophiles, and iodide is a good leaving group. It is used for alkylating carbon, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus nucleophiles. Unfortunately, it has a high equivalent weight: one mole of iodomethane weighs almost three times as much as one mole of methyl chloride. On the other hand, methyl chloride and methyl bromide are gaseous, thus harder to handle, and are also weaker alkylating agents.\n\nIodides are generally expensive relative to the more common chlorides and bromides, though iodomethane is reasonably affordable; on a commercial scale, the more toxic dimethyl sulfate is preferred, since it is cheap and has a higher boiling point. The iodide leaving group in iodomethane may cause unwanted side reactions. Finally, being highly reactive, iodomethane is more dangerous for laboratory workers than related chlorides and bromides.\n\nFor example, it can be used for the methylation of carboxylic acids or phenols:\n\nIn these examples, the base (KCO or LiCO) removes the acidic proton to form the carboxylate or phenoxide anion, which serves as the nucleophile in the S2 substitution.\n\nIodide is a \"soft\" anion which means that methylation with MeI tends to occur at the \"softer\" end of an ambidentate nucleophile. For example, reaction with thiocyanate ion favours attack at rather than \"hard\" , leading mainly to methyl thiocyanate (CHSCN) rather than methyl isothiocyanate CHNCS. This behavior is relevant to the methylation of stabilized enolates such as those derived from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Methylation of these and related enolates can occur on the harder oxygen atom or the (usually desired) carbon atom. With iodomethane, C-alkylation nearly always predominates.\n\nIn the Monsanto process, MeI forms \"in situ\" from the reaction of methanol and hydrogen iodide. The CHI then reacts with carbon monoxide in the presence of a rhodium complex to form acetyl iodide, the precursor to acetic acid after hydrolysis. Most acetic acid is prepared by this method.\n\nMeI is used to prepare the Grignard reagent, methylmagnesium iodide (\"MeMgI\"), a common source of \"Me\". The use of MeMgI has been somewhat superseded by the commercially available methyllithium. MeI can also be used to prepare dimethylmercury, by reacting 2 moles of MeI with a 2/1-molar sodium amalgam (2 moles of sodium, 1 mol of mercury).\n\nIodomethane and other organic iodine compounds do form under the conditions of a serious nuclear accident, after both Fukushima and Chernobyl iodine-131 in the form of organic iodine compounds were detected in Europe and Japan respectively.\n\nIodomethane had also been proposed for use as a fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nematicide, and as a soil disinfectant, replacing methyl bromide (also known as bromomethane) (banned under the Montreal Protocol). Manufactured by Arysta LifeScience and sold under the brand name MIDAS, iodomethane is registered as a pesticide in the U.S., Mexico, Morocco, Japan, Turkey, and New Zealand and registration is pending in Australia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, Egypt, Israel, South Africa and other countries. The first commercial applications of MIDAS soil fumigant in California began in Fresno County, in May, 2011.\n\nIodomethane had been approved for use as a pesticide by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 as a pre-plant biocide used to control insects, plant parasitic nematodes, soil borne pathogens, and weed seeds. The compound was registered for use as a preplant soil treatment for field grown strawberries, peppers, tomatoes, grape vines, ornamentals and turf and nursery grown strawberries, stone fruits, tree nuts, and conifer trees. After the discovery phase in a consumer lawsuit, the manufacturer withdrew the fumigant citing its lack of market viability.\n\nThe use of iodomethane as a fumigant has drawn concern. For example, 54 chemists and physicians contacted the U.S. EPA in a letter, saying \"We are skeptical of U.S. EPA’s conclusion that the high levels of exposure to iodomethane that are likely to result from broadcast applications are 'acceptable' risks. U.S. EPA has made many assumptions about toxicology and exposure in the risk assessment that have not been examined by independent scientific peer reviewers for adequacy or accuracy. Additionally, none of U.S. EPA’s calculations account for the extra vulnerability of the unborn fetus and children to toxic insults.\" EPA Assistant Administrator Jim Gulliford replied saying, \"We are confident that by conducting such a rigorous analysis and developing highly restrictive provisions governing its use, there will be no risks of concern,\" and in October the EPA approved the use of iodomethane as a soil fumigant in the United States.\n\nThe California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) concluded that iodomethane is \"highly toxic,\" that \"any anticipated scenario for the agricultural or structural fumigation use of this agent would result in exposures to a large number of the public and thus would have a significant adverse impact on the public health\", and that adequate control of the chemical in these circumstances would be \"difficult, if not impossible.\" Iodomethane was approved as a pesticide in California that December. A lawsuit was filed on January 5, 2011, challenging California's approval of iodomethane. Subsequently, the manufacturer withdrew the fumigant and requested that California Department of Pesticide Regulation cancel its California registration, citing its lack of market viability.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture iodomethane exhibits moderate to high\nacute toxicity for inhalation and ingestion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists inhalation, skin absorption, ingestion, and eye contact as possible exposure routes with target organs of the eyes, skin, respiratory system, and the central nervous system. Symptoms may include eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, ataxia, slurred speech, and dermatitis. In high dose acute toxicity, as may occur in industrial accidents, toxicity includes metabolic disturbance, renal failure, venous and arterial thrombosis and encephalopathy with seizures and coma, with a characteristic pattern of brain injury.\n\nIodomethane has an for oral administration to rats 76 mg/kg, and in the liver it undergoes rapid conversion to S-methylglutathione.\n\nIn its risk assessment of iodomethane, the U.S. EPA conducted an exhaustive scientific and medical literature search over the past 100 years for reported cases of human poisonings attributable to the compound. Citing the EPA as its source, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation concluded, “Over the past century, only 11 incidents of iodomethane poisoning have been reported in the published literature.” (Hermouet, C. \"et al.\" 1996 & Appel, G.B. \"et al.\" 1975) “An updated literature search on May 30, 2007 for iodomethane poisoning produced only one additional case report.” (Schwartz MD, \"et al.\" 2005). All but one were industrial—not agricultural—accidents, and the remaining case of poisoning was an apparent suicide. Iodomethane is routinely and regularly used in industrial processes as well as in most university and college chemistry departments for study and learning related to a variety of organic chemical reactions.\n\nIt is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded based on studies performed after methyl iodide was Proposition 65 listed that: “Methyl iodide is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).” the Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as \"not likely to be carcinogenic to humans in the absence of altered thyroid hormone homeostasis,\" i.e. it is a human carcinogen but only at doses large enough to disrupt thyroid function (via excess iodide). However this finding is disputed by the Pesticide Action Network which states that the EPA’s cancer rating \"appears to be based solely on a single rat inhalation study in which 66% of the control group and 54-62% of the rats in the other groups died before the end of\nthe study\". They go on to state: \"The EPA appears to be dismissing early peer-reviewed studies in favor of two nonpeer-reviewed studies conducted by the registrant that are flawed in design and execution.\" Despite requests by the U.S. EPA to the Pesticide Action Network to bring forth scientific evidence of their claims, they have not done so.\n\n\n\n"}

Stam was extraordinarily well-connected, and his career intersects with important moments in the history of 20th-century European architecture, including chair design at the Bauhaus, the Weissenhof Estate, the Van Nelle Factory, an important modernist landmark building in Rotterdam, buildings for Ernst May's New Frankfurt housing project then to Russia with the idealistic May Brigade, to postwar reconstruction in Germany.\n\nHis style of design has been classified as New Objectivity, an art movement formed during the depression in 1920s Germany, as a counter-movement and an out growth of Expressionism.\n\nMartinus Adrianus Stam was born in Purmerend, The Netherlands, on 5 August 1899 to a tax collector and his wife (no records are available of her career). He attended a local school in Purmerend, before training in Amsterdam at the Royal School for Advanced Studies (\"Rijksnormaalschool for Teekenonderwijzers\") for two years between 1917 and 1919.\n\nAfter qualifying in 1919, Stam began working as a draftsman with an architectural firm in Rotterdam. He boldly stated between his qualification and first career that \"We have to change the world.\" The architectural firm was run by the architect Granpré Molière. Molière was a traditionalist, and had a different style of design to Stam, but the two worked together well, possibly because they were both Christians, and Stam was invited to work for Molière personally in his studio in Rotterdam.\n\nHowever, in 1920, Stam was imprisoned for refusing to serve in the military (dienstweigeren), something which was compulsory in the Netherlands at that time. Those that refused to conscribe were imprisoned for the time period of which the service would take place. Fortunately, Stam was released in 1922, and later that year, created what has been said to be his first major achievement - in 1922, through a contest, he was appointed to draw up urban infrastructure plans for The Hague region. This was a standard plan in many senses, but the main striking feature, was that the majority of the roads, particularly in coastal areas, ran perpendicular to the beach. It is still not known why Stam chose to design them in that way.\n\nBy the end of 1922, Stam had moved to Berlin, where he began to develop his style as a \"New Objectivity\" architect. In the 3-year period he successfully worked in two major agencies – \"Bureau Granpré Molière\" and \"To Van der Mey\". This work would benefit him greatly through his later years.\n\nHis first major work in Berlin was under prominent architect Max Taut. Stam was assigned to design a variety of buildings across Germany, notably assisting Taut in the design of the German Trade Union Federation Building, Düsseldorf. During this time, he also worked with Russian avant-garde architect El Lissitzky. The pair's most striking design was the \"Wolkenbügel\", or cloud iron, a t-shaped skyscraper supported on 3 metal framed columns. Although never built, the building was a vivid contrast to America's vertical building style, as the building only rose up a relatively modest height then expanded horizontally over an intersection so make better use of space. Its three posts were on three different street corners, canvassing the intersection. An illustration of it appeared on the front cover of Adolf Behne's book, \"Der Moderne Zweckbau\", and articles on it written by Lissitzky appeared in an issue of the Moscow-based architectural review, ASNOVA News (journal of ASNOVA, the Association of New Architects), and in the German art journal \"Das Kunstblatt\".\n\nIn Zurich in 1924 he co-founded the magazine \"ABC Beitrage zum Bauen\" (Contributions on Building) with El Lissitzky. Other editor included Hans Schmidt, future Bauhaus director the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer, Hans Wittwer and Emil Roth.\n\nStam is also credited for at least part of the design of the Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam, built from 1926 through 1930 (dates vary). This coffee and tea factory is still a powerful example of early modernist industrial architecture, recently rehabilitated into offices. An embarrassing dispute over the authorship of this design caused Stam to leave the office of Leen Van der Vlugt, the credited designer.\n\nAfter moving to Berlin, Stam devised a steel-tubing cantilever chair, using lengths of standard gas pipe and standard pipe joint fittings. New research indicates that Stam was inspired by a cantilever tubular steel seat seen installed in a 1926 Tatra T12 two-door saloon car. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became aware of Stam's work on the chair during planning for the Weissenhof Siedlung and mentioned it to Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus. This led almost immediately to variations on the cantilevered tubular-steel chair theme by both Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, and began an entire genre of chair design. In the late 1920s, Breuer and Stam were involved in a patent lawsuit in German courts, both claiming to be the inventor of the basic cantilever chair design principle. Stam won the lawsuit, and, since that time, specific Breuer chair designs have often been erroneously attributed to Stam. In the United States, Breuer assigned the rights to his designs to Knoll, and for that reason it is possible to find the identical chair attributed to Stam in Europe and to Breuer in the U.S.\n\nStam contributed a house to the 1927 Weissenhof Estate, the permanent housing project developed and presented by the exhibition \"Die Wohnung\" (\"The Dwelling\"), organized by the Deutscher Werkbund in Stuttgart. This put him in the company of Le Corbusier, Peter Behrens, Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig, and Walter Gropius, and the exhibition had as many as 20,000 visitors a day. In 1927 he became a founding member, with Gerrit Rietveld and Hendrik Petrus Berlage, of the Congrès Internationaux d`Architecture Moderne (CIAM).\n\nIn the late 1920s Stam was part of the team at the New Frankfurt project. In 1930 Stam became one of the 20 architects and urban planners organized by Frankfurt city planner Ernst May who traveled together to the Soviet Union to create a string of new Stalinist cities, including Magnitogorsk. The \"May Brigade\" included Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, her husband Wilhelm Schütte, Arthur Korn, Erich Mauthner and Hans Schmidt. Stam was there in February 1931 to participate in the struggle to build rational worker housing from the ground up, an effort ultimately defeated by adverse weather, corruption, and poor design decisions. Stam moved to planning activities in Makeyevka in Ukraine in 1932, then to Orsk, with his friend Hans Schmidt (again) and with Bauhaus student and future wife Lotte Beese, then to the copper-mining Soviet city of Balgash. Stam returned to the Netherlands in 1934.\n\nStam was later named director of the Institute of Industrial Art in the Netherlands. From 1948 to 1952 he moved to postwar Germany, with its major reconstruction projects. In 1948 he took a professorship at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste Dresden and began advocating a modern, strict structure for the heavily destroyed urban landscape, a plan which most of the citizens rejected as an \"all-out attack on the identity of the city\", and which would have obliterated most of the remaining landmarks. In 1950 Stam became director of the Advanced Institute of Art in Berlin. Returning to Amsterdam in 1953, Stam and his wife moved to Switzerland in about 1966 and withdrew from public view. He died, aged 86, in Zürich.\n\n\n"}

He began his music career in 1990, and by the time he was 13 years old, under the name \"Lil Mac\", he released his debut album, \"The Lyrical Midget\". The album was one of the earliest commercial hip-hop albums to come out of New Orleans, and featured production from New Orleans producer Mannie Fresh.\n\nLil Mac would later join the Psychoward, a New Orleans group consisting of more than 28 MCs. Psychoward is known in New Orleans for having a sound that separates itself from the usual Bounce music and gangster/hustler lyrics that typifies most of the New Orleans rap scene, rather focusing on lyricism and a sound which could be described as a \"New Orleans Wu-Tang Clan\". This made them favorites of local hip hop fans who often prefer this style to other local acts. In 1997, the group released their debut album, www.psychoward.com to acclaim, with many naming Lil Mac as the standout artist.\n\nAfter rejecting an offer to move to New York and sign with Def Jam Records, Lil Mac changed his name to simply Mac and signed with Master P's No Limit Records. He toured with No Limit throughout the U.S. and Europe, and made guest appearances on many other artists' albums before releasing his own. He was featured on Master P's \"Ghetto D\", Mystikal's \"Unpredictable\", and Mia X's \"Unlady Like\", among others. The next year in 1998, Mac released his second solo album and first with No Limit, \"Shell Shocked\". The album is Mac's most commercially successful to date, reaching #11 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Mac again was featured on many other No Limit artist's releases that year. In 1999, he released his second album on the label, \"World War III\". While it was still on the label, this release differed from usual No Limit releases in that it was not exclusively produced by the production team Beats by the Pound, and featured only three guest appearances from major No Limit names Master P, C-Murder, and Silkk the Shocker. The album did not fare as well commercially as his first No Limit release, peaking at #44 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Mac's musical style differed from many other Southern hip hop artists in this period, and he often displayed a level of lyrical complexity that has come to be associated with East Coast hip hop.\n\n\"World War III\" would be Mac's last album released on No Limit and his last solo album to date, as he would be sentenced to a 30-year prison term for manslaughter after 19 year old Barron C. Victor, Jr. died from a gunshot wound in a Louisiana nightclub in 2001. In 2000, he joined the group 504 Boyz, whose name was a reference to the area code 504. The group was a collective of other No Limit rappers such as Master P, Silkk the Shocker, and C-Murder. Mac was with the group for one album, 2000's \"Goodfellas\", which went gold and reached #2 on the \"Billboard\" 200. He was featured prominently on the group's hit single \"Wobble Wobble\", rapping the first verse and the chorus. The song reached #17 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn 2007, while Mac was still serving his prison term, No Limit released the album \"The Lost Tapes\", which consisted of unreleased material Mac recorded with the label.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, DJ 5150 released the mixtape \"Uptown Veterans\"' which is a compilation of Mac's greatest hits.\n\nPhipp’s son, McKinley Green, was born in 2000\n\nOn February 21, 2000, Phipps was scheduled to perform at Slidell, Louisiana nightclub Club Mercedes, but a fight broke out before the show that resulted in Phipps allegedly shooting 19-year-old Barron C Victor, Jr. after Victor attempted to break up the fight. Phipps was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, and was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to thirty years to life in prison on September 21, 2001. He is currently serving his sentence at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana.\n\nIn December 2014, Northwestern University's Medill Justice Project (MJP), in partnership with The Lens, published the results of a three-month investigation of Phipps' conviction, revealing that a key eyewitness at his trial gave his private investigator an affidavit in 2013 that stated she was coerced into identifying Phipps as the shooter because of investigators' threats to charge her. Following Medill's investigation, David Lohr of \"The Huffington Post\" published the results of a four-month review of Phipps' conviction, further revealing that four other witnesses to the shooting told the publication that they also were threatened, intimidated or outright ignored by investigators. Phipps' family has since obtained affidavits from many of the individuals in an effort to get him a new trial.\n\nOn March 25, 2015, rapper Killer Mike told students at Dillard University in New Orleans that it was unacceptable for authorities to use rap lyrics in the prosecution of Phipps: \"If we let this stand, what you're going to see is that tool is going to be used to wipe out an entire potential generation of [artists] out of our community.\"\n\nPhipps has applied for the Louisiana governor’s clemency in 2016, asking to be released from prison for time served. In the petition sent to the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Parole he seeks a commutation due to a \"wrongful conviction and excessive sentence\", as \"evidence developed over the last two years\" which includes, among other things, findings from MJP’s investigation.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250810", "title": "Bairam Khan", "text": "Bairam Khan\n\nBairam Khan () was an important military commander, later commander-in-chief of the Mughal army, a powerful statesman and regent at the court of the Mughal Emperors, Humayun and Akbar. He was also guardian, chief mentor, adviser, teacher and the most trusted ally of Akbar. Humayun honored him as \"Khan-i-Khanan\", which means \"King of Kings\". Bairam was originally called Bairam \"Beg\", but later became honored as 'Kha' or Khan. Bairam Khan was an aggressive general who was determined to restore Mughal authority in India. Two divans are attributed to him, one in Persian and the other in Chagatai.\n\nBairam Khan was born in the region of Badakhshan in Central Asia, and belonged to the Baharlu Turkoman clan of the Kara Koyunlu confederation. The Kara Koyunlu had ruled Western Persia for decades before being overthrown by their Ak Koyunlu rivals. Bairam Khan's father Seyfali beg Baharlu and grandfather Janali beg Baharlu had been part of Babur's service. His great-grandfather was Pirali beg Baharlu, a brother to Babur's wife Pasha Begum and son-in-law of Qara Iskander.\n\nBairam entered Babur's service at the age of 16 and played an active role in the early Mughal conquests of India. Bairam Khan later contributed greatly to the establishment of the Mughal empire under Humayun when he was entrusted with the position of \"muhardar\" (keeper of the seals) and took part in military campaigns in Benares, Bengal and Gujarat. He accompanied Humayun during his exile in Persia and helped conquer Kandahar before serving as its governor for nine years. In 1556, he played a leading role as a commander in Humayun's reconquest of Hindustan.\n\nFollowing Humayun's death in 1556, Bairam Khan was appointed regent over the young monarch Akbar. As regent, he consolidated Mughal authority in northern India and most notably led the Mughal forces at the Second Battle of Panipat, which was fought between Akbar and Hemu in November 1556.\n\nBairam Khan was a Shia Muslim and was disliked by some of the Sunni Turkic nobles. Although a Shia, he attended Friday services in the mosque of a noted Sufi and was also responsible for Shah Gada, the son of Sikandar Lodi's court poet Jamali Kamboh, becoming \"sadr-as-sudr\" in the Mughal Empire after Humayun's return to Delhi in 1555.\n\n\"Gazetteer of Ulwur\" states:\n\nIn these struggles for the restoration of Babar's dynasty Khanzadas apparently do not figure at all. Humayun seems to have conciliated them by marrying the elder daughter of Jamal Khan, the nephew of Babar's opponent Hasan Khan Mewati, and having his minister, Bairam Khan, marry Jamal's younger daughter. Bairam's other wife was Salima Sultan Begum, who married Akbar after his death.\n\nDue to a difference in opinion with Bairam Khan, Akbar told him that he could either retire and stay in the palace or go on the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. On his way, his opponents goaded him to rebel, but he was defeated in the Punjab. Akbar gave him the option of staying in the court as an advisor or continuing his pilgrimage. Bairam chose the latter. While traveling through Gujarat he was killed. It came about when Bairam Khan was at Sahastralinga Tank, a religious site near Anhilwad Patan, and was recognised by Lohani Pashtun, an associate of Haji Khan Mewati. Upon learning of this, Haji Khan planned his attack and killed Bairam Khan in order to take revenge for Emperor Hemu's death. Haji Khan Mewati was from Alwar and he had been a general of Hemu, and had been staying at Patan, after his defeat by Akbar's forces and the capture of Alwar Sarkar in 1559.\n\nBairam Khan died on 31 January 1561. However, his son and wife were allowed to go free and were sent to Agra. Bairam Khan's wife, who was also the cousin of Akbar, married Akbar after Bairam Khan's death. Bairam's son, Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, became an important part of Akbar's administration and was one of the \"nav-ratans\" (nine gems) of Akbar's court.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He represented Serbia and Montenegro at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLjuboja was born in Vinkovci, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia to Serb parents. There he played in the youth teams of NK Dinamo Vinkovci, NK Osijek and Red Star Belgrade. He moved to France where his professional career started with Sochaux in the 1998–99 season. Ljuboja made his debut, coming on as a substitute in the 76th minutes for Anthony Sirufo, in a 2–1 loss against Lyon on 11 September 1998; then on 31 October 1998, Ljuboja scored his first goal and scored another, in a 4–0 win over Montpellier. However, in his first season, Sochaux was relegated to Ligue 2. The next season, Ljuboja soon became an important member of the first team and began his goalscoring form, including a hat-trick in a 5–1 win over Créteil on 15 April 2000. At the end of the season, Ljuboja's goalscoring form led him to become a top-scorer for the club, but he was second top-scorer behind Amara Traoré. However, the club wasn't able to return to Ligue 1, having come one point too short. In his two-year stint with the team, he played 62 games scoring 20 goals.\n\nFollowing his stay with Sochaux, Ljuboja moved to Strasbourg in the 2000–01 season. In his first season, he made a slow start, scoring three goals in thirty appearances. The club was relegated despite winning the Coupe de France final, beating Amiens 5–4 on penalties. Soon in his second season, Ljuboja was able to bounce back, scoring fifteen goals and the club to return to Ligue 1. He also made two appearances in the UEFA Cup competition, scoring twice against Belgian side Standard Liège but the club was knocked out, having lost 2–0 in the first leg. Strasbourg was explained, due to winning the Coupe de France, the previous season. The next season, in which the French League was renamed to Ligue 1, Ljuboja's goalscoring form soon faded, with nine goals but the club still remained in Ligue 1. The season after, Ljuboja soon formed an important strike partnership with newly signing Mamadou Niang, which was short-lived as he moved from Strasbourg to PSG. Because of his departure, Niang didn't score again for the remainder of the second half of that season. Upon his departure, Ljuboja had made 123 league appearances scoring 34 goals in total. In December 2003, Ljuboja was linked with Ligue 1 rival Paris Saint-Germain and two unknown Premier League clubs.\n\nDuring the 2003–4 January transfer window, Ljuboja moved from Strasbourg to Paris Saint-Germain for a 3.000.000€ fee. In his first half of the season at PSG, Ljuboja made a good start, scoring six goals, including four goals in three consecutive games. Also, his new club was able to win the Coupe de France, beating Châteauroux 1–0. During his time at PSG, he faced competition from strikers like Pauleta and Fabrice Pancrate.\n\nAhead of the 2004–05 season, Ljuboja soon had a rift with manager Vahid Halilhodžić after Halilhodžic was far from happy with Ljuboja's attitude in pre-season training, resulting not trained for the past two days due to a back complaint. This led a transfer speculation by moving to Monaco. Despite the strained relationship, Ljuboja first team wasn't affected. However, in September 2004, Ljuboja was disgusted with Halilhodžic after he wasn't included in a match against Monaco and was omitted from the first team despite lack of attackers at the club. Ljuboja told L'Equipe that Halilhodžic didn't give him explanations ahead of a match and that he was 100 percent committed at PSG. In January transfer window, with PSG announcing their intentions to sell Ljuboja, Ljuboja was linked with clubs around Europe like Barcelona, Málaga, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur. However, no move was made as Ljuboja desired to stay at the club.\n\nHis 2004–05 season wasn't a success as he scored twice and his form was declining and the club finished in the ninth place. During the season, he played five games with the team in the UEFA Champions League. He scored seven times in 42 league appearances.\n\nIn 2005, he transferred to German club side Stuttgart, at first on loan, having been linked with clubs like Mallorca, Marseille and Bolton. After joining Stuttgart, Ljuboja said he left PSG, not for the revenge he received last season but to keep his dream alive ahead of a World Cup. Weeks later, Ljuboja made his debut, on 10 September 2005, in a 1–1 draw with Arminia Bielefeld; and a month later, he scored his first goal, on 23 October 2005, in a 1–1 draw with Bayer Leverkusen. Three days before scoring his first Bundesliga goal, Ljuboja scored his first goal in the UEFA Cup in a 2–0 win over Rennes and scored a brace in a 2–0 win over P.A.O.K. At Stuttgart, he formed a striking partnership with Jon Dahl Tomasson. Later in the season, he scored eight goals and the club finished in ninth place.\n\nHe was contracted in April 2006 (through 2009), but by that his income, that was still paid half by PSG, was lowered significantly. Although he had a valid contract, he demanded from Stuttgart the same wages he got before from PSG. Stuttgart in consequence told him to look for a new club in the summer of 2006 and let him train with their reserve team that played in the third German league.\n\nIn August 2006, Ljuboja was transferred on loan to Champions League participant Hamburger SV for one year with the option to buy the player afterwards.

He also played six games with the team in the UEFA Champions League. At Hamburg, he was also demoted to the reserves team because he did not participate in team briefings. Hamburger SV did not use their option to buy him, so he went back to VfB Stuttgart at the end of the season.\n\nUpon his return, VfB Stuttgart was looking to offload him to another club and he was placed at the Stuttgart reserves. Ljuboja says that he wanted back to France, having desire to leave Stuttgart but to no avail. At the end of July, he was linked a move to Italian side Siena, but the transfer did not materialize.

He made his league debut in the club's opening match of the season, a 2–0 defeat at home to Marseille on 8 August 2009, coming on for Josip Tadić. In the next game, he scored his first goal, in a 2–1 loss against Boulogne. On 8 May 2010, he scored a brace in a 2–0 win over Boulogne. At the end of the season, Grenoble was relegated to Ligue 2. Despite the relegation, he had a good season, scoring ten goals in thirty-four appearances.

In his first season, he won the 2012 Polish Cup.\n\nThe next season, Ljuboja started his season when he scored two goals in the Europa League qualifying, in both legs against SV Ried. In the league, his performance got better when he scored a hat-trick on the opening game of the season, in a 4–0 win over Korona Kielce. In late November, his performance could have made him a legend icon at the club. In January, Ljuboja could leave the club at the end of the season. The club would win a double: the league and the cup. In May 2013, Ljuboja, along with Miroslav Radović, was disciplined by the club over drinking alcohol in one of the club's premises.

{"id": "2250835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250835", "title": "A*mazing", "text": "A*mazing\n\nA*mazing was an Australian children's television game show that aired between 16 May 1994 until 1998 on the Seven Network. It was famous for a relatively large and elaborate maze/obstacle course that was part of the show's studio set. \"A*mazing\" was hosted by James Sherry for the entire run of the series. \"A*mazing\" was produced at Channel 7 in Brisbane from 1994–1996 and then at Channel 7 in Perth from 1997–1998.\n\nThe show pitted teams from two different primary schools against each other during the course of a week. Points gained by each contestant during the week would be totalled up to decide the winning school at the end of each week.\n\nIn the first round of the game, a 90-second countdown timer begins, and Sherry begins to provide clues to a word or phrase to the first school's contestants. Contestants have to correctly guess the word or phrase before running down to a large QWERTY keyboard mounted on the floor and stepping on the letters to spell it out. The process is repeated for the second school. If contestants were unable to guess the word initially, the clues would get easier until the word was spelled out by Sherry. The time remaining determines how many points they get, plus how long each school gets to spend in the maze during round two.\n\nDuring the second round, one contestant from each school would enter the maze and attempt to collect the letters of the answer which are hidden in such places as a garbage can, or behind a mock cactus. Ten points are given for every letter they retrieve inside the maze before their time runs out.\n\nOccasionally, the maze would include letters that are not part of the answer; if a contestant collected these superfluous letters, they would not receive any extra points in addition to the points earned by collecting the valid letters.\n\nRound three is the same as the round one; it will just be a different word or phrase they will have to guess and spell out.\n\nRound four is the same as the second round except that the other contestant from the team enters the maze in order to find the letters to their word.\n\nIn the fifth round, the contestants competed in a video game face off. During the course of the show, three different gaming platforms, all provided by sponsor Nintendo, were used. Originally the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1994–1996) and later the Nintendo 64 (1997–1998).\n\nGames played included \"Tetris\", \"Bubsy\", \"Donkey Kong Country\", \"\", \"Super Mario World\", \"Nigel Mansell's World Championship\", \"Plok\", \"Pac-Attack\", \"1080° Snowboarding\", \"\", \"Wave Race 64\", \"Super Mario Kart\", \"Mario Kart 64\", \"\", \"Multi-Racing Championship\", \"Cruis'n USA\", \"Diddy Kong Racing\", \"Super Mario 64\", \"Winter Gold\", \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", \"Super Tennis\", \"Cruis'n World\", and the fly-swatting minigame from \"Mario Paint\".\n\nThe team with the most points/fastest time win fifty points for their team, while runners-up in this challenge win 25 points for their team. Should there be a tie (e.g. both teams score the same number of coins in \"Super Mario Kart\" or hit the same number of flies in the fly-swatting mini-game from \"Mario Paint\"), both teams score 25 points each. Originally, 100 points were awarded to the winners and 50 points to the runners-up.\n\nAfter the third round, the team with the highest score would then go back to the maze for 90 seconds (later changed to 120 seconds) to collect keys. One player will choose which side of the maze they want to explore. Only when that player exits that maze can the other player enter the other half of the maze. There were seven keys, including a bonus one, in the maze; each key was worth 100 points. If either of the contestants found the bonus key, then both of the contestants would each get an original Game Boy (also provided by Nintendo), which later became a Game Boy Pocket. Only once were all seven keys found in the maze (under the 90-second rule limit).\n\nIf there was a tie after the third round, a sudden-death question was read out to both teams in the style of the first round, and whoever answered the question correctly would technically win the game for the day and go into the maze to search for the keys.\n\nBy the end of the week, the school with the highest number of points would win a grand prize, which was usually educational computer software or an encyclopedia set. Other prizes included tickets to the Wet'n'Wild theme park in Gold Coast, Australia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2250840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250840", "title": "Tau Beta Sigma", "text": "Tau Beta Sigma\n\nTau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Band Sorority (ΤΒΣ, colloquially referred to as TBSigma or TBS) is a co-educational service sorority.\n\nThe Sorority, headquartered at the historic Stillwater Station in Stillwater, Oklahoma, numbers over 3,800 active members in 160 active chapters, and over 40,000 alumni. Since 1946, Tau Beta Sigma has been recognized by Kappa Kappa Psi as \"an equal affiliated organization with a parallel purpose, function and role in the college and university band setting\", and the two organizations hold joint conventions. The two organizations contribute to a national publication called, \"The Podium.\" Tau Beta Sigma also administers an Alumni Association open to members and friends of both organizations.\n\nTau Beta Sigma was founded at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) by Mrs. Wava Banes (Turner Henry). Due to corporation laws in the state of Texas at the time, however, the Texas Tech sisters surrendered their name, ritual, jewelry, constitution and Alpha chapter designation in January 1946 to the local band sorority at Oklahoma State University. The Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was installed at OSU on March 26, 1946. This had the additional effect of locating both of the Alpha chapters of Tau Beta Sigma and Kappa Kappa Psi at the same school. The founding members of the Alpha chapter were: Rosemary Wright, Frances Martin, Ebba Jensen, Mary Belle Reece, Margaret Stanffer, Bernice Friend, and Maribeth Crist. Later, on May 4, 1946, the Beta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was founded at Texas Tech.\n\nThe first practical idea for establishing a “band sorority” for college and university bandswomen came about during the spring semester of 1939. Wava Banes, along with two of her classmates (Emily SoRelle and Ruth La Nell Williams), took the idea to director D.O. Wiley of the Texas Technological College Band. The idea, patterned after Kappa Kappa Psi, began to come together the following semester and resulted in the campus organization Tau Beta Sigma. Much like the Fraternity, Tau Beta Sigma's purpose at Tech was to serve as an honorary service and leadership recognition society, but was designed especially to provide the important additional social, educational, and other positive experiences needed by women in the band. The fledgling organization petitioned for recognition as an official campus organization from Dean of Women Mary Doak in spring 1940.\n\nDuring these initial meetings of 1939–40, the women elected officers and began work on sorority crests and jewelry. The first officers of the organization were: president, Wava Banes; vice-president, Emily SoRelle; secretary, Lillian Horner; treasurer, Nita Furr; reporter, Barbara Griggs; and faculty sponsor, Mrs. D. O. Wiley. Miss SoRelle provided all of the sketch work on the emblem and shield that were adopted as the official emblems of the sorority. However, two of the founding members, Wava and Emily, graduated at the end of the spring 1940 term. As band enrollment changed due to participation in World War II, the girls of the Tech Bands continued to develop the fledgling organization. By October 1941, TBS had begun communications with the National Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi for assistance in becoming a national organization.\n\nIn June 1943, the Tech women petitioned the Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi to become an auxiliary part of the National Fraternity as an active chapter. Accepting the group under these circumstances, however, would have entailed a complete revision of the Kappa Kappa Psi constitution. With World War II in progress, it was unsure as to when the National Chapter would hold their next convention where the issue could be brought to debate. Rather than postponing action on the women's request indefinitely, the women at Texas Tech approached A. Frank Martin, Grand Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi, in January 1946 to provide assistance in forming their own national organization, just as the National Fraternity had done in 1919. Until a national convention of Kappa Kappa Psi could be held and the matter clarified, Tau Beta Sigma could be considered the “sister organization” of the Fraternity. The Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi agreed that Tau Beta Sigma could share in all fraternal publications.\n\nThrough the assistance of A. Frank Martin, the ritual and National Constitution were completed. Likewise, the Balfour Company completed designs for the sorority badge and pledge pin. When applying for a national charter, D.O. Wiley and the girls at Texas Tech again turned to A. Frank Martin and offered to turn over their work and the name Tau Beta Sigma to the women's band sorority at Oklahoma A&M, known as Kappa Psi, to submit the articles of incorporation in Oklahoma. Through this act, the chapter at Oklahoma A&M would become the Alpha chapter. As part of this agreement, the chapter at Texas Tech, Beta, would be known as the founding location of the Sorority and the members stipulated that Wava Banes would be known as the Founder, the agreement also specified that the 1st National President would be from the Beta chapter.\n\nSimilar women's organizations at Colorado University and the University of Oklahoma submitted petitions to join with the Texas Tech and O.A.M.C. chapter prior to the official charter being received. On March 26, 1946, a charter was granted by the Department of State for the State of Oklahoma legally establishing “Tau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Band Sorority,” later amended to “Tau Beta Sigma.” On May 4 of 1946, the members of the Alpha chapter traveled to Lubbock, Texas, to officially install the women of Texas Tech as the Beta chapter of the National Sorority.\n\nSince that time, Tau Beta Sigma has expanded to over 230 campuses across the United States.\n\nIn addition to the close relationship with Kappa Kappa Psi, Tau Beta Sigma has historical and current relationships with several other organizations. One such relationship is with Sigma Alpha Iota, an international fraternity for women with a strong interest in music.\n\nIn 1999, joint statements were issued by the leadership of Tau Beta Sigma and Sigma Alpha Iota, along with Kappa Kappa Psi and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, affirming \"that there are equally important roles for Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Alpha Iota, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma to fulfill on any campus where our chapters mutually exist, now or in the future. Each organization possesses a distinct mission and, as a result, fulfills a unique and vital role in the musical environment of a college campus\" and that \"A member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota can hold simultaneous membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma, subject to his/her own interests and the eligibility requirements of the other organizations. The same holds true for a member of Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma with regard to membership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota.\"\n\nThe National Intercollegiate Band (NIB) is a concert band, sponsored by honorary band fraternity and sorority Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma, that performs every two years at the national convention of the two organizations. Organized in 1947, the NIB is the oldest national intercollegiate band in the United States and is open to all collegiate band members regardless of membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma.\n\nSince 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have commissioned a new work for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. This program was begun to add to the wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. A number of these commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including Robert Russell Bennett's \"Symphonic Songs for Band\" and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as Frank Ticheli's \"An American Elegy\", in memory of the Columbine High School massacre.\n\nOriginally located on the campus of Oklahoma State University, the National Headquarters of Tau Beta Sigma is housed in Stillwater Station, the retired Stillwater Santa Fe Depot in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The headquarters staff carries out the day-to-day operations of the Sorority.\n\nThe headquarters staff includes:\n\nThe national officers of Tau Beta Sigma for the 2019-2021 biennium are:\n\nThere are currently nine members of the Tau Beta Sigma Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees represents the Corporation in all matters and ensures the Corporation remains financially sound by directing the finances of the Trust.\n\nThe current Board of Trustees members for Tau Beta Sigma are:\n\nThe current Executive Council members for the Tau Beta Sigma Alumni Association are:\n\nThe sorority is divided into three basic levels - National, District, and chapter. The sorority's business is handled hierarchically, so that an issue is handled in chapter meetings, district conventions, and then nationally. There are seven districts divided by geography: Northeast, Southeast, North Central, Midwest, Southwest, Western, and International (a hypothetical district comprising all chapters outside the United States). Each district is led by one or more District Counselors, as well as a council of elected student officers by the members of the Districts.\n\nDistrict Counselors are regional advisors for the Sorority. They actively work with each district's student leadership and communicate with chapter sponsors. District Counselors are appointed by the National President for two-year terms, and are currently limited to serving three terms.\n\nThe districts are as follows:\n\nNotable members of Tau Beta Sigma include:\n\n"}

After studies at the Brussels Conservatory with Louis Brassin (piano) and François-Auguste Gevaert (composition), he began a career as a virtuoso, but soon abandoned this for composition. In 1877 his cantata \"Klokke Roeland\" won him the Belgian Prix de Rome, and in 1881 he succeeded Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens as director of the Mechelen Institute of Religious Music.\n\nHe devoted himself to a study of old church music, and his ideas gave rise to Pope Pius X's \"Motu proprio\". Appointed inspector of music education in 1889, he moved to the Brussels Conservatory to become professor of counterpoint and fugue in 1896, and director at the end of 1908. He was made maître de chapelle to the king in 1910, having been elected to the Belgian Royal Academy in 1902.\n\nHis liturgical music is polyphonic in the Palestrina style, but this technique conflicted with Tinel's lyrical and mystical temperament, and he had much greater success in his two concert settings of the Te Deum, the oratorio and the religious dramas.

The school and building were paid for by Sir James Donaldson (1751–1830), who, for a time, was publisher of the \"Edinburgh Advertiser\". The original benefaction was that there should be 200 boys and 200 girls and allowed for special bursaries for poor children. Not all were deaf, although applications on behalf of deaf children were encouraged. From 1938, pupils were exclusively deaf. This benefaction was similar in style to the benefaction of George Watson, who founded and supported other schools in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1938, the Royal Institute for Deaf and Dumb, Edinburgh was merged into Donaldson's School. The Royal Institute for Deaf and Dumb had been founded in 1824 and had been located in Henderson Row, Edinburgh (in a building designed by the architect James Gillespie Graham) and the building then became part of Edinburgh Academy.\n\nThe 1851 A-listed Donaldson's Hospital building in Edinburgh was designed by architect William Henry Playfair in the Jacobethan inspired by Elizabethan manor houses. The building is built round a quadrangle in Tudor architecture style with large corner towers which themselves are each made up of four smaller towers. Queen Victoria opened the building in 1850 and is reputed to have said that the building was more impressive than many of her own palaces.\n\nAfter more than 150 years based in the Playfair building, Donaldson's finally concluded that the building was no longer fit for purpose. Many of the rooms were no longer in use, classrooms were unable to use the latest educational technology and the Trust could no longer afford to maintain the building. In 2003 the school's building was put up for sale and was purchased by Scottish property developer Cala Homes for £22 million although the school continued to have use of the building until they moved out in 2008.\n\nIn 2015 City and Country, a property developer, submitted plans to develop the Donaldson's Hospital building and the East and West Gatehouses into luxury residential accommodation. Cala Homes also submitted a plan to build a new crescent of luxury residential accommodation at the rear of the former Donaldson's Hospital building.\n\nA new, purpose-built Donaldson's campus opened at Preston Road (EH49 6HZ) in Linlithgow in January 2008. The new campus had facilities for up to 120 pupils.\n\nAs a national Grant Aided Special School (GASS) supported by the Scottish Government the central location of the new site made the facilities more accessible to pupils from all over Scotland and the north of England.\n\nThe new Donaldson's School in Linlithgow was developed in collaboration with staff, pupils, governors, acousticians and architects. It was built with a focus on energy efficiency and the environment. Shared teaching, sports and dining facilities formed a hub linking two teaching wings the primary and secondary schools. Both schools were grouped around individual play spaces with links and views across the surrounding area. Facilities included a gym, swimming pool, fitness room, dining room, library, and assembly hall as well as an art studio. Classrooms, each of which accommodated six pupils, feature soundfield systems and interactive whiteboards. Donaldson's Lodge (residential accommodation) had 24 rooms placed in a separate building at the edge of the site in Linlithgow.\n\nDonaldson's uses British Sign Language (BSL), Signed Supported English and spoken English, and caters for children and young people from five to 18 years. The curriculum is delivered by an interdisciplinary team of specialist teachers who are supported by specialist learning support assistants and residential care workers, providing round the clock education and care. The team includes: specialist teachers; speech and language therapists; a physiotherapist; and an occupational therapist.\n\nIn 2015 the school's principal announced that the school had been making losses for several years and that the nursery section of the school would close.\n\n"}

The election was triggered by the retirement of chairman Lien Chan.\n\nThis was the second direct election of the chairman in Kuomintang history. All registered, due-paying KMT party members were eligible to vote. Previous leaders of the KMT had been elected by the party congress in a one-man race (with the candidate being either the incumbent or his designated successor). Lien ran unopposed in 2001, but his election was decided by rank and file party members. Lien retired without naming a successor, choosing to retain a direct election for the office of chairman.\n\nThe election was widely seen as a preliminary contest for the party's nomination in the 2008 presidential election. Ma's landslide victory over Wang originally made him the frontrunner in the bid for the KMT presidential nomination. An indictment over corruption in 2007 damaged Ma's election hopes, but he eventually ended up winning the 2008 presidential election.\n\nThe following KMT chairmanship election occurred in 2007.\n\nThe election was less about specific issues and more about personality. Both candidates supported a conciliatory approach toward relations with the People's Republic of China and supported the party's opposition to Taiwan independence and support of the 1992 consensus. They both promised to reform the party to make it more democratic and crack down on black gold. Ma's supporters argued that being younger and more charismatic, he would provide the party with a more youthful, clean, and open image which would be useful for the party in the 2008 legislative elections and the 2008 presidential elections. Wang's supporters cited his experience as speaker of the Legislative Yuan and his support among party leaders as vital in uniting the pan-Blue Coalition.\n\nMa Ying-jeou ran in the election while serving as the mayor of Taipei City and a vice chairman of the KMT. His efforts at cracking down on black gold during his tenure as Justice Minister in the 1990s earned him a reputation of incorruptibility, especially because he was fired from this post for alienating the political underground, and his political career was considered to be over. His clean and competent public image and personal charisma has made him a widely popular politician, especially among female and younger voters. However, his critics claim that he, unlike his opponent, lacks friends among the KMT's political elite and has little experience in forging political alliances. In addition, his opponents claim that Ma's background as a Mainlander (he was born in Hong Kong to Hunanese parents) may become a problem when he runs for president (in the 2004 presidential election President Chen Shui-bian questioned his mainland-born opponents' loyalty towards Taiwan and questioned whether they would \"sell Taiwan out\" to the PRC). In response, his supporters cite polls that indicate that Ma is popular among all ethnicities and regions in Taiwan, and that substantial numbers of DPP supporters have indicated in polls that they would vote for him.\n\nWang Jin-pyng, also a vice chairman of the KMT, though less popular and charismatic than his opponent, has gained the reputation of being a shrewd and capable politician. He has served in the Legislative Yuan since 1976 and as the President of the Legislative Yuan since 1999. As President of the Legislative Yuan, he was seen as being a conciliatory leader, avoiding the heated rhetoric to reach across the political divide.\n\nWang enjoyed the support of many KMT political heavyweights. He was endorsed by party elders Lee Huan, Chen Jien-chung, Sung Shih-hsuan, and Yu Chung-ji. Prominent legislators John Chiang and Lee Ching-hua also supported Wang's candidacy. Around 130 retired generals also endorsed Wang, including president of National Defense University Cheng Pan-chi, former combined services deputy Wang Yi-tien, and former deputy director and executive officer of the ministry's Political Warfare Bureau Chen Hsing-kuo. In an about-face from his earlier pledge and order to other People First Party (PFP) politicians not to involve themselves in the election for KMT chairmanship, In the night before the election, PFP Chairman James Soong made a videotaped appearance to endorse Wang. Lien Chan, although promising to stay neutral during the campaign, was accidentally caught by news cameras voting for Wang Jin-pyng. This was seen as a move by Lien to unify the KMT, since Wang was trailing far behind Ma in the polls. In contrast, the only senior KMT political heavyweight endorsement received by Ma was from Hau Pei-tsun, although Ma received endorsement from some of his fellow middle-aged KMT politicians, including Jason Hu, the mayor of Taichung; Eric Chu, the magistrate of Taoyuan County; and Wu Den-yih, legislator from Nantou County and former mayor of Kaohsiung.\n\nWang's status as a Holo-speaker associated with the pro-localization faction of the KMT required him to dispel fears that he would turn out to be \"another Lee Teng-hui\" (who founded the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union and was expelled from the party) or that he would leave the KMT to join the TSU if he lost the election. At the same time, Ma needed to dispel the stereotype of him as an urban Mainlander from Taipei unconnected with rural southern Holo-speaking Taiwan.\n\nDuring the campaign both candidates attempted to dispel their stereotypes: Wang stressed his loyalty to the KMT and Republic of China (such as by singing patriotic songs from the Chiang Kai-shek-era) and gaining the support of conservative Mainlander heavyweights within the KMT. His Mainlander opponent Ma stressed his connection with the people of Taiwan and proposed measures such as moving some KMT Central Standing Committee meetings from Taipei to southern Taiwan.\n\nOver 1 million KMT party members were eligible to vote. In the months leading to the election there was bitter debate between the two candidates over which party members were eligible to vote. While the Ma campaign wanted to limit the vote 300,000 party members fully paid-up in their annual dues, the Wang campaign argued that all 1.1 million card-carrying members would be eligible. The 300,000 members \"in good standing\" were mostly veterans and party members, considered part of the right-wing of the party, who were most likely to vote for Ma on the basis of his mainlander background. The 1.1 million members included a much greater proportion of native Taiwanese and some less enthusiastic supporters of the party who joined as a result of working for a state-run enterprise in which, before democratic reforms in the 1990s, KMT membership was encouraged and somewhat compelled. Finally it was agreed to that all card-carrying members would be able to vote as polls showed Ma running ahead of Wang even with the franchise opened. This request by Wang arguably backfired, as it might have very well been the case that members who were less involved with internal party politics became more attracted to Ma's personality.\n\nThe chairmanship election coincided with elections for 985 party delegates for the KMT's 17th national party congress. Each voting booth had three ballot boxes: one ballot box for the party chairman, the second ballot box for the party delegates, and the third ballot box for KMT members from military villages also voting for delegates.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2250900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250900", "title": "Mountjoy Prison", "text": "Mountjoy Prison\n\nMountjoy Prison (), founded as Mountjoy Gaol and nicknamed \"The Joy\", is a medium security prison located in Phibsborough in the centre of Dublin, Ireland. It has the largest prison population in Ireland.\nThe current prison warden is Brian Murphy.\n\nMountjoy was designed by the British military engineering officer, Captain Joshua Jebb, Royal Engineers and opened in 1850, based on the design of London's Pentonville Prison also designed by Jebb. Originally intended as the first stop for men sentenced to transportation, they would spend a period in separate confinement before being transferred to Spike Island and transported from there to Van Diemen's Land.\n\nA total of 46 prisoners (including one woman, Annie Walsh) were executed within the walls of the prison, prior to the abolition of capital punishment. Executions were done by hanging, after which the bodies of the dead were taken down from the gallows and buried within the prison grounds in unmarked graves. The list of prisoners executed at Mountjoy Prison includes:\n\nAnnie Walsh from Limerick, who was found guilty of murdering her husband, was executed in Mountjoy prison on 5 August 1925. She remains the only woman ever executed by the Irish State which was founded in 1922.\n\nAfter being convicted of murdering a Garda officer, Charlie Kerins, former Chief of Staff to the Anti-Treaty IRA, was hanged at Mountjoy Prison on 1 December 1944.\n\nThe last execution carried out in the Republic of Ireland, that of Michael Manning, took place in Mountjoy Prison on 20 April 1954.\n\nSome Irish leaders involved with the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War were held there. On 14 May 1921, an IRA team led by Paddy Daly and Emmet Dalton mounted an attempt to rescue Sean McEoin from the prison. They used a captured armoured car to gain access to Mountjoy, but were discovered and had to shoot their way out.\n\nThe Fenian poet, author of the popular song \"Rising of the Moon\", John Keegan 'Leo' Casey was imprisoned here during the 1860s; subsequently in the 20th century playwright and IRA activist Brendan Behan was also gaoled within.\n\nOn 31 October 1973, it was the scene of a spectacular escape by a hijacked helicopter by three Provisional Irish Republican Army prisoners, including Seamus Twomey and J.B O'Hagan.\n\nBy 2006, a 60-hectare site had been acquired for €30 million at Thornton Hall, Fingal, where a replacement for Mountjoy was to be constructed. The new facility was intended to accommodate 1,400 prisoners. The site was planned to include court facilities, video-conference links, medical and therapeutic facilities, but due to government cutbacks these plans have now been sidelined.\n\nIn August 2006, prisoners who were normally separated from the rest of the population for safety were mixed together for a night with mentally ill inmate Stephen Egan. Prisoner Gary Douche was killed by Egan who was found not guilty of murder due to a lack of responsibility. This prompted the Minister of Justice to seek a limit of 520 inmates on the capacity of the prison.\n\nIn October 2010, the prison was placed under lockdown after a night of violence and rioting involving more than 70 inmates. It started when a number of prisoners attacked three prison officers with pool cues and balls during recreation. Reinforcements were brought in from around Dublin to quell the riot and a number of Alsatians from the riot unit were also deployed.\n\nIn 2016, figures were released showing that Mountjoy Prison saw a disproportionate number of prisoners hospitalised due to assaults and self-harm. In response, the Irish Penal Reform Trust said the \"ongoing levels of violence and intimidation in Irish prisons, particularly in Mountjoy Prison, must be addressed\".\n\nMountjoy Prison is constructed along a radial design with four main wings, A through D, each of which have three landings, as well as an underground basement landing. The wings are connected to a central circle, known simply as 'the circle'. When originally built in 1850 it had 500 cells each of which was designed for single capacity. Many parts of the original building have either been renovated or destroyed. At the time of the 2009 inspection, there were 371 cells in the main unit of the prison. These are the original cells which were built in 1850 for single occupancy. Their size varies from 3.91m x 2.06m to 3.43m x 2.06m. The prison was built with in-cell sanitation but this was removed in 1939 when it was deemed that 'prisoners were using too much water'. However, all cells in the main jail have in-cell sanitation following refurbishment in the period 2010 to 2015. These cells contain a toilet, a sink, a television and a small kettle.\n\nFacilities in the prison include gymnasiums, computer classes, carpentry, masonry and a wide variety of school activities such as music, drama and cookery. Prisoners can undertake to complete academic exams in the school such as Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate and even Open University. Additionally, there is an on-site kitchen and bakery where trusted inmates are given employment under supervision.\n\nThe Medical Unit, otherwise referred to as the drug detoxification unit, is a three storied structure. It provides accommodation for sixty prisoners in forty-eight single person cells and three cells that can accommodate up to four people. All the cells in this unit have in-cell sanitation facilities. It is equipped with medical facilities, classrooms and kitchen facilities. The Inspector of Prisons reported in 2009 that this unit was bright and clean and did not suffer from overcrowding.\n\nThe Controlled Behavioural Unit, known as the CBU or the Block, is used for unruly prisoners or those on punishment and is located in the 'D' Base, underneath the D wing. This includes 24-hour lock-up, with the exception of one hour of open air exercise, and no integration with other inmates.\n\nThe Separation Unit had 35 cells. It also had kitchen facilities a shower block and a laundry. In the late 1980s, inmates diagnosed with HIV or AIDS were housed in the separation unit. This policy was brought to an end on 1 January 1995. Following the unit's refurbishment in 1997, all cells had in-cell sanitation. The separation unit was closed indefinitely in 2014 following an inspection by the Inspector of Prisons.\n\nThe Mountjoy Campus is home to three other separate penal facilities.\n\n\nA former governor was Charles Arthur Munro, brother of the Edwardian satirist Saki.\n\nThe schizophrenic French surrealist playwright Antonin Artaud was briefly detained in Mountjoy before his deportation from Ireland as \"a destitute and undesirable alien\".\n\nThomas Ashe was also a former inmate of the jail for his involvement in the Easter rising 1916. After a protest of starvation he was transferred across the street to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on 25 September 1916 where he died a few hours after arrival.\n\nCarey, Tim : \"Mountjoy – The Story of a Prison\" :The Collins Press : 2000 : \n\n\n"}

Its responsibilities include security of key SAF military installations, the guarding of the Ministry of Defence, ceremonial sentries at the Istana, forming the ceremonial guards for visits by VVIPs to the country and other national events, the maintenance of discipline through enforcement and the operation of the SAF Detention Barracks, and search and rescue operations, amongst others. In wartime contingencies, it would also be tasked with safeguarding prisoners-of-war (POWs), protecting rear-echelon areas/HQs and securing important supply routes and relevant bases.\n\nFormed on 1 September 1966 at the old Beach Road Camp, the SAF Provost Company initially consisted of one company of military policemen and was part of the Manpower Division, although it came under the command of HQ 1 SIB. In the same year, the School of Provost and the first detention cells were in operation at Beach Road Camp. With the implementation of National Service a year later in 1967, the unit grew exponentially in membership, before the entire unit moved to the Hill Street Camp in 1970. The Singapore Armed Forces Dog Company and Operations Company were established there.\n\nIn February 1971, the three companies were merged officially to form the Singapore Armed Forces Provost Unit (SAFPU) and moved to the Mowbray Camp at Ulu Pandan Road in July 1971. The Kranji Disciplinary Barrack was built in 1972, before being converted into a proper detention facility in 1977. The British Army Military Correction Centre was handed over to the SAF and renamed as the Tanglin Detention Barracks in 1972. Changi Detention Barracks opened in 1973, and Nee Soon Detention Barracks in 1974. The SAF Detention Barracks was opened on 29 March 1987 to replace the three facilities.\n\nThe Security Company (SC) was added to the SAFPU, while the Special Investigations Branch (SIB) was formed in July 1973. In 1974, the sixth sub-unit, the 1st Reservist Provost Company, was formed, completing the organisational structure of the unit which has remained so to this day. The Operations Company took on ceremonial functions in 1980, and formed the first prestige guard for the German ambassador to Singapore.\n\nThe distinctive Military Police uniform was first introduced in 1983. In 1984, a 93-man unit drawn from the ranks of the SAFPU formed the Silent Precision Drill Squad (SPDS), trained with the help of foreign instructors for a performance for that year's National Day Parade at the Padang, which would turn out to be its historic debut performance, seen live on Singaporean television. The overwhelmingly positive public response led to the sub-unit becoming a permanent fixture, and since then, has become one of the most well-known and visible aspects of the SAFPU which the general public would relate to. In the National Day Parade in 1986, they made their 2nd NDP performance and their 1st ever at the National Stadium, alongside the Women's Pipe Band of the Singapore Police Force, and put up its first mass precision drill performance there during the NDP in 1988. It performed twice for the Malaysian King and the general public at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1989, during that year's Merdeka Parade.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, the SAFPU began performing ceremonial sentry duties at the Istana, the official residence of the President of Singapore, and the monthly Change of Guard parade has since become a public spectator event also attracting the attention of tourists. New colours was awarded to the unit by ex-president Ong Teng Cheong during the SAF Day Parade in 1995.\n\nToday, the unit is based at a new camp near Choa Chu Kang. In keeping with tradition, the new road leading to the camp was called Mowbray Road, and the camp itself retaining the Mowbray Camp name. The old Mowbray Camp has since been handed over to the Singapore Police Force, which initially used the camp for training Police National Service reservists with the now-defunct KINS unit and now currently operates the camp for the new ProCom (Protective Security Command) unit, which replaced KINS. From 1 September 2006, the unit was renamed the \"Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command\" (SAFMPC).\n\nVision: \"To Inspire Pride and Discipline in the SAF\"\n\nMission: \"To uphold and enforce military law, order and discipline in the SAF, support homeland security operations, and perform ceremonial duties for the state and MINDEF.\"\n\nMotto: \"Pride, Discipline and Honour\"\n\nMarches: \"Pride, Discipline and Honour\" is also the name of the unit's regimental Slow March (listen: ), composed by Captain Lee Kah Hee Johnson, currently the Director of Music of the SAF Parade Band A. The regimental Quick March of the unit is entitled \"Spot-On\", composed by Major Ervin E. Dragon.\n\nCreed: \"I am a Military Policeman in the Singapore Armed Forces. I serve my country with Pride, Discipline and Honour. With Pride, I will always discharge my duties firmly, fairly and honestly without fear or favour. With Discipline, I will always strive for the highest standards of soldiering. With Honour, I will always accomplish my missions courageously, loyally and decisively.\"\n\nThe formation is headed by the Command Headquarters which oversees its daily operations, and supported by four units specialising in the various specific operational responsibilities of the SAF MPC.\n\nThe unit consists of the following units:\n\n\nIt is the active wing of the SAF MPC and executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles carried out by the SAF MPC. MPEU is currently led by Commanding Officer MPEU, LTC Michael Lui who is assisted by his Regimental Sergeant Major, 2WO Goh Soon Lee.\n\nLECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel on the road as well as performing escort duties. LECC also performs regular enforcement spot checks for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. Another platoon enforces the public image of the SAF by booking offenders who smoke in uniform and commit other offences in uniform while in the eye of the public, while also performing ceremonial duties. The Enforcement Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) performs regular operations in residential areas, workplaces, and many public places such as shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to apprehend deserters, AWOL offenders, drug addicts and other military criminals. They work closely with the Singapore Police Force and are often in very dangerous situations and are extremely well trained for handling the varied scenarios that they find themselves in. The management of Mowbray Station is overseen by the Escort and Processing Office (EPO) platoon who is also in charge of registering and detaining suspects and offenders of military crimes in holding cells. The station is similar to a civilian police station and it is usually the first stop for detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks after being formally charged by their unit or a temporary holding cell for servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. Since 31 December 2008, MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new branch within its ranks. The Special Security and Protection (SSP) Branch is involved in sensitive operations so no further information is available. The Military Police Traffic Platoon (MP TP) regularly perform traffic enforcement and ceremonial duties. In addition, the SAF Military Working Dog Unit (SAF MWDU) is a wing under MPEU and it is in charge of all dog training and the conduct of all operations involving military working dogs.\n\nThe investigative branch for the SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates higher-order military crimes that requires specialised handling. The current Head SIB is MAJ See Gim Tat.\n\nHeaded by a commandant, the SAFDB consists of MPs in charge of supervision of detainees of the SAF who have been charged in accordance to the SAF Act (Chapter 295). The current Commandant of SAFDB is LTC Seah Thiam Wee Benson who is assisted by his Barrack Sergeant Major 2WO Alwin Ong.\n\nFormerly known as the School of Provost & Military Police Training School (MPTS), the Security and Policing Leadership School (SPLS) and Security and Policing Vocational School (SPVS) are part of the larger IDTI that is in charge of equipping trainees with necessary and fundamental military policing skills as well as instilling in them a high standard of discipline through the vocational courses and specialised courses such as the Silent Precision Drill Courses (SPDS). Both schools also provide legislation courses for senior commanders all over the SAF. SPLS is currently led by CO SPLS, MAJ Yu JinLiang and SPVS is currently led by CO SPVS, SWO Low Soon Pan.\n\nThe headquarters of the Command comprises various branches, namely the Manpower Branch (MP), General Staff Branch (GS), and Logistics Branch. Each branch is headed by a branch head who serves concurrently as the Command's Manpower, Ops and Training and Logistics Officer. Command HQ is led by Commander, COL Lee Kuan Chung, assisted by the Formation Sergeant Major, SWO Chew Kim Leng.\n\nThe current Commander, formerly Provost Marshal of the SAF MP Command is COL Lee Kuan Chung. Past Provost Marshals/ Commanders include:\n\nThe current Formation Sergeant-Major of the SAF MP Command is SWO Chew Kim Leng. Past Formation Sergeant-Major include:\n\nAs is the case for other members of the Singapore Armed Forces, SAFMPC members wear a variation of uniforms for each specific usage or occasion. They are, however, probably most distinctively identified by the Olive Drab-coloured No.3 uniform shirt and pants (gartered ankles) worn by members of the military police, complemented by a white cotton stable belt, white lanyard with whistle, a white helmet with the letters \"MP\" in red type or a blue beret, and combat boots. This attire was first introduced in 1983, and has remained largely unchanged, even after most of the SAF has adopted the camouflage-coloured no.4 uniform from 1985. The camouflage uniform may also be worn, but SAFMPC members are distinguished by wearing a black leather brassard on the right arm, with the letters \"MP\" in orange. Security troopers formerly known as Regimental Police (RP) wears a black leather brassard with the words \"Security Troopers\" in red while Military security personnel from the Singapore Guards wears the same brassard with the words \"Military Security\" in white.\n\nIn ceremonial occasions and other important official functions, such as in the forming of the Guard of Honour for visiting VIPs and the Singapore National Day, when performing ceremonial guard duties at important state institutions such as the Istana, members of the SAFMPC wear the army No.1 uniform.\n\nThe SAFMPC is the only unit in the SAF to don a unique cap badge design incorporating elements from the crest of the Singapore Police Force and the Armed forces, featuring the Coat of Arms and laurels from the SAF crest, but with the words \"SAF Military Police\" on a ribbon design similar to the SPF's crest.\n\nSAF MP officers are frequently seen armed with either the Heckler & Koch P30 pistol as their sidearm or the SAF-standard-issue SAR 21 rifle. For ceremonial purposes, they are equipped with the Lee–Enfield or the SAR 21. MPs are also equipped with handcuffs or zip ties, aside from firearms, to restrain suspects as well as truncheons as a non-lethal option that can be deployed\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2250937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250937", "title": "Cross of Sacrifice", "text": "Cross of Sacrifice\n\nThe Cross of Sacrifice is a Commonwealth war memorial designed in 1918 by Sir Reginald Blomfield for the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). It is present in Commonwealth war cemeteries containing 40 or more graves. Its shape is an elongated Latin cross with proportions more typical of the Celtic cross, with the shaft and crossarm octagonal in section. It ranges in height from . A bronze longsword, blade down, is affixed to the front of the cross (and sometimes to the back as well). It is usually mounted on an octagonal base. It may be freestanding or incorporated into other cemetery features. The Cross of Sacrifice is widely praised, widely imitated, and the archetypal British war memorial. It is the most imitated of Commonwealth war memorials, and duplicates and imitations have been used around the world.\n\nThe First World War introduced killing on such a mass scale that few nations were prepared to cope with it. Millions of bodies were never recovered, or were recovered long after any identification could be made. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were buried on the battlefield where they lay. It was often impossible to dig trenches without unearthing remains, and artillery barrages often uncovered bodies and flung the disintegrating corpses into the air. Many bodies were buried in French municipal cemeteries, but these rapidly filled to capacity. Due to the costs and sheer number of remains involved, Australia, Canada, India, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom barred repatriation of remains.\n\nFabian Ware, a director of the Rio Tinto mining company, toured some battlefields in as part of a British Red Cross mission in the fall of 1914. Ware was greatly disturbed by status of British war graves, many of which were marked by deteriorating wooden crosses, haphazardly placed and with names and other identifying information written nearly illegibly in pencil. Ware petitioned the British government to establish an official agency to oversee the locating, recording, and marking of British war dead, and to acquire land for cemeteries. The Imperial War Office agreed, and created the Graves Registration Commission in March 1915. In May, the Graves Registration Commission ceased to operate an ambulance service for the British Red Cross, and in September was made an official arm of the military after being attached to the Royal Army Service Corps.\n\nDuring its short existence, the Graves Registration Commission consolidated many British war dead cemeteries. Ware negotiated a treaty with the French government whereby the French would purchase space for British war cemeteries, and the British government assumed the cost of platting, creating, and maintaining the sites. Over the next few months, the Graves Registration Commission closed British war dead cemeteries with fewer than 50 bodies, disinterred the bodies, and reinterred them at the new burying grounds. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in February 1916.\n\nAs the war continued, there was a growing awareness in the British Army that a more permanent body needed be organized to care for British war graves after the war. In January 1916, the prime minister H. H. Asquith appointed a National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves to take over this task. Edward, Prince of Wales agreed to serve as the committee's president. The committee's membership reflected all members of the British Commonwealth (with a special representative from India). Over the next year, members of the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves began to feel that their organization was inadequate to the task, and that a more formal organization, with a broader mandate, should be created. The idea was broached at the first Imperial War Conference in March 1917, and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) was chartered. Lord Derby was named its chair, and the Prince of Wales its president.\n\nPrior to the First World War, the British (as well as continental European) tradition was to bury officers who died on the battlefield in individual graves and common soldiers in mass graves. The Great War changed this sentiment, as it was a total war, one in which nations engaged in the complete mobilization of all available resources, modes of production, and population in order to fight. Subsequently, as the war continued, there was a growing expectation among the people of the United Kingdom that foot soldiers as well as officers should not only be buried singly but commemorated. Many British families had already tried to visit the graves of loved ones, and could not locate them. Numerous letters appeared in newspapers decrying the problem, and Ware realized the British war effort was heading toward a public relations disaster. Ware, too, felt that the experience of war in the trenches was reducing socio-economic and class barriers. He firmly believed that British policy should be to treat all war dead alike, regardless of class or ability to pay. Wealthy families should not be able to repatriate their dead, inter remains privately in France, nor erect ornate memorials over their loved ones.\n\nIn July 1917, after consulting with architectural and artistic experts in London, Ware invited Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, architects; Charles Aitken, director of the Tate Gallery; and author Sir James Barrie to tour British battlefield cemeteries near the front in an attempt to formulate broad ideas for the post-war design of these burying grounds. The trip began on 9 July. The group met formally on 14 July after the trip ended. Ware, Lutyens, and Baker agreed that every cemetery ought to obey a general theme (although the theme was not yet established), that there should only be four variations on the theme (monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries), that grave markers should be uniform headstones (not crosses), and that cemetery walls should be horizontal. Aitken insisted on cemeteries of simple design and low cost, feeling public money should be spent on practical items like schools and hospitals. Baker wanted a cross at each cemetery, but Lutyens wanted a more abstract symbol. Aitken supported Baker in thinking that a cross was more appropriate in the French countryside. At one point, Baker suggested a cross with a pentagonal shaft (one side for each self-governing dominion), and for Indian cemeteries a column topped by appropriate symbol (such as the dharmacakra or Star of India).\n\nWare, Lutyens, and Baker met for a second time to discuss cemetery planning at the IWGC headquarters in London on 21 September 1917. They were joined by Arthur William Hill, then the assistant director of Kew Gardens. Both Baker and Lutyens presented draft designs for various types of cemeteries, but no agreement was reached on any design principles. After Ware informed him about the lack of unanimity among his advisors, the Prince of Wales advised Ware to keep news of any disagreements out of public view.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of agreement among and hardening positions adopted by Lutyens, Baker, and Aitken, Ware turned to Sir Frederic G. Kenyon, director of the British Museum and a highly respected ancient languages scholar. Kenyon not only had expertise in art and architecture, but he was imperturbable, systematic in his work methods, businesslike, and practical. He was also a lieutenant colonel in the British Army and had served in France, and he and Ware agreed to emphasize his military rank as a way of keeping disputes in check. Kenyon's appointment was one of the first actions taken by the IWGC at its inaugural meeting on 20 November 1917. Aitken was released that same month. Ware asked Kenyon to help break the deadlock as quickly as possible. Over the next two months, Kenyon twice visited battlefield cemeteries in France and Belgium and consulted with a wide range of religious groups and artists. Kenyon agreed that Commonwealth military cemeteries should be uniform in order to emphasize their military character and the role the collective has over the individual in the armed forces. But he went a step further, and argued that the cemeteries should also be maintained in perpetuity by the British government, something never before attempted for large numbers of military graves. With Lutyens arguing for a \"value free\" and pantheistic Stone of Remembrance and Baker pushing for an elaborate and almost Neoclassical approach, Kenyon advocated a compromise solution. His rationale was that some of the decisions made about the cemeteries would prove to be highly controversial, and something had to be done to win over public opinion. To do so, Kenyon pushed for a cross to be added to each site. Although costly (particularly in the smaller cemeteries), Kenyon argued that most families were Christian and expected a cross, most families saw the cross as a sign of the sacrifice their loved ones made in death, and the addition of the cross would mollify the politically influential Church of England.\n\nLutyens argued for an obelisk rather than a cross. When he lost that argument, he argued that the cross should have a shortened cross-arm and a lengthened shaft, in order to emphasize its verticality amidst the trees of the French countryside. That argument was also unpersuasive.\n\nKenyon's report, \"War Graves: How the Cemeteries Abroad will be Designed\", was submitted to Ware in February 1918. The IWGC accepted them at its meeting on 18 February. With Baker and Lutyens, although good friends, at odds about how to design the cemeteries despite agreement on general themes, Kenyon recommended that only young architects, who served in the war, be hired as cemetery designers. A team of senior architects—which would include Lutyens, Baker, and one other—would oversee the designs. With minor additions, Kenyon's report was published in November 1918.\n\nAfter receiving the Kenyon report in February 1918, the following month Ware appointed Reginald Blomfield to be one of the senior architects overseeing the design of British war cemeteries. Blomfield was chosen on the recommendation of Kenyon. Blomfield was an expert in both British and French architecture, and had written extensively on garden planning. Blomfield was greatly experienced in serving on committees, commissions, and government advisory bodies, and Ware hoped that Blomfield would use his age, experience, and dominance in the field of architecture to help rein in Baker and Lutyens. Ware also hoped that Blomfield's amiable nature and firm hand would keep the disagreements between Baker and Lutyens from getting out of hand. Furthermore, Blomfield was a widely acknowledged expert in generating highly accurate cost estimates and in crafting excellent contracts. Blomfield was paid £400 per year in 1918, which was raised to £600 per year in 1919.\n\nThe same month he was appointed to the senior architects' committee, Blomfield accompanied Lutyens and Baker on a tour of French and Belgian battlefields.\n\nKenyon, Baker, and Blomfield all submitted cross designs to the senior architects' committee. Kenyon submitted two draft designs, one for a Celtic cross and one for a medieval Christian cross (both typically found in old English cemeteries). Baker, who had advocated the cemetery theme of \"crusade\" since July 1917 and (according to Goebel, was \"obsessed\" with the idea), submitted the design of a stone Christian cross with a bronze longsword (called a Crusader's sword by Baker) on the front. His design, which he called the \"Ypres cross\", also included a bronze image of a naval sailing ship, emblematic of the Royal Navy's role in winning both the Crusades and the First World War.\n\nBlomfield, on the other hand, took a different approach to the cross. He rejected Kenyon's design, arguing that \"runic monuments or gothic crosses had nothing to do with the grim terrors of the trenches.\" Blomfield wanted a design that reflected the war, which had stripped away any notions about glory in combat and nobility in death on the battlefield. \"What I wanted to do in designing this Cross was to make it as abstract and impersonal as I could, to free it from any association of any particular style, and, above all, to keep clear of any sentimentalism of the Gothic. This was a man's war far too terrible for any fripperies, and I hoped to get within range of the infinite in this symbol...\" His design featured an elongated cross of abstract design, on the front of which was a bronze longsword, blade pointed downward. It was intended to be an overtly Christian symbol, in contrast to Lutyen's Stone of Remembrance (which was purposefully stripped of any such associations). Blomfield drew the inspiration for the sword from a sword which hung in his home in Rye.\n\nThe senior architects' committee quickly endorsed the Blomfield design. The committee considered adding text to the base or steps of the cross, but rejected this idea.\n\nIn order to ensure that the architects' ideas for Commonwealth cemeteries worked well in the field, the IWGC decided to fund the construction of three experimental cemeteries Le Tréport, Forceville, and Louvencourt. The goal was to determine how expensive the cemeteries were likely to be. The model cemeteries were designed by Baker, Lutyens, and Blomfield, and began construction in May 1918. Due to problems with construction, none were complete until early 1920, six months later than planned. Each model cemetery had a chapel and shelter, but no Stone of Remembrance or Cross of Sacrifice. Nevertheless, even without these major additions, the cemeteries were too expensive.\n\nThe model cemeteries experiment changed the way the Stone of Remembrance was placed in cemeteries, and almost changed the design of the Cross of Sacrifice itself. To reduce costs, Blomfield offered to design a wide variation of Crosses, many of which were less costly than the original design. But the committee of senior architects rejected his offer. What became apparent with the experimental cemeteries is that a full-size Cross or Stone was appropriate only for the largest cemeteries. Mid-size and smaller cemeteries needed smaller memorials. Blomfield quickly designed two smaller-sized Crosses to accommodate this need. But Lutyens refused to allow anything but a full-sized War Stone ( in length and in height) to be used. Subsequently, and partly as a cost-saving measure, no Stone of Remembrance was erected in a cemetery with fewer than 400 graves. Budgetary issues also led the committee to agree that shelters should be forgone in any cemetery with fewer than 200 graves.\n\nThe model cemeteries experiment also helped the architects decide where to place the Cross of Sacrifice. As early as 1917, Lutyens and Kenyon had agreed that the War Stone should be in the east, but facing west. (All graves were supposed to face east, facing the enemy, although many of the earliest cemeteries had graves facing in other [sometimes in many different] directions.) The initial idea was to have the Cross of Sacrifice be in opposition to the Stone. In practice, however, the placement of the Cross of Sacrifice varied widely.\n\nThe model cemeteries experiment also had one other effect, and that was to make Blomfield's design for the cross the only one ever used by the IWGC. The original intent of the senior architects had been to allow each junior architect to design his own cross for his own cemetery. But Blomfield's design proved so wildly popular that the decision was made to implement it as a standard feature in all cemeteries.\n\nThe formal adoption of Blomfield's Cross of Sacrifice, and the concepts regarding its placement, position, and use, were outlined by Kenyon in a report, \"A Memorandum on the Cross as Central Monument\", submitted in January 1919 as an addendum to his November 1918 main report.\n\nAccording to Fabian Ware, the name \"Cross of Sacrifice\" arose spontaneously from an unknown source, and attached itself to the cross.\n\nThe Cross of Sacrifice is carved from white stone. This is usually Portland stone, but it is sometimes granite or any type of white limestone commonly found in France or Belgium. In Italy, Chiampo Perla limestone was used. The proportions of the cross, with short arms close to the top of the shaft are similar to some Celtic crosses, the crossarm being one-third the length of the shaft (as measured from the point where the shaft emerges from the base). The cross consists of three pieces: The shaft, from base to crossarm; the crossarm; and the upper shaft, above the crossarm. The crossarm is fastened to the lower and upper shaft by two bronze dowels. A joggle (a portion of the shaft which extends into the base, acting as a joint) about long extends into the base, where it is secured by another bronze dowel. The shaft and crossarm are both octagonal in shape, and the shaft tapers slightly as it rises to give the cross entasis. On the large size version, there are three plain mouldings on the shaft near the base, often reduced to one in smaller sizes, and the three extremities of the cross finish at a plain moulding projecting sideways from the main element. The crossarms are sometimes irregular octagons in section, with four wide faces at front, back, top and bottom, and four shorter faces in between them. \n\nA stylized bronze longsword, point down, is fastened to the front of the cross. The cross is designed so that a second bronze sword may be fastened to the rear as well. The sword is positioned so that the crossguard on the sword matches where the cross' shaft and crossarm meet.\n\nThe Cross of Sacrifice originally came in four heights: , , , and . Sizes up to are now permitted; exceptionally so too larger versions. As of 2012, the largest stands as the instance at the Halifax Memorial in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.\nThe shaft is fastened to an octagonal base. The size of the base varies, according to the height of the shaft, but the high cross has a base in diameter. This largest base weighs . The base usually sits on three octagonal steps. This can vary, however, depending on the height of the cross, its placement in the cemetery, and whether it is part of some other cemetery element.\n\nThe position of the Cross of Sacrifice in Commonwealth war cemeteries varies depending on a wide range of factors. Many cemeteries were laid out haphazardly during the war. The role of the junior designing architect was to determine the position of the Cross (and Stone of Remembrance) in relationship to the graves. Most cemeteries had two axes—a main axis and an entrance axis, or a main/entrance axis and a lateral axis. An overriding guiding principle was that the War Stone should be the focus of the cemetery. The Cross of Sacrifice, however, usually functioned as the primary orienting feature of the cemetery for visitors, due to its height. In hilly areas, the architect had to ensure that the cross was visible from the road or path. (This was far less important in flat areas, obviously.) When a road passed directly by the cemetery, the cross usually was placed near the road and the entrance to the cemetery associated with the cross. These design considerations meant that the Cross of Sacrifice could be placed in a wide variety of places. Sometimes it was situated next to the War Stone, and sometimes in opposition to it. In some cases, the Cross of Sacrifice was placed in a distant corner of the cemetery, so that its relationship to the Stone of Remembrance was not clear. \n\nIt was not necessary for the Cross of Sacrifice to stand alone, either. In some cases, it was incorporated into a wall or benches. The placement of the Cross of Sacrifice affected other elements of the cemetery. The architect's choice of buildings to erect—double shelters, galleries, gateways, pergolas, sheltered alcoves, or single shelters—depended on the location of the War Stone, the Cross of Sacrifice, and the size of the cemetery.\nA Cross of Sacrifice was erected in almost every Commonwealth war cemetery. Subsequent Commonwealth War Graves Commission policy has erected the cross Commonwealth war cemeteries with 40 or more graves. There were only a handful of exceptions. No cross was erected in cemeteries which held a majority of Chinese or Indian graves. In Turkey, no cross was erected in order to accommodate local Muslim feelings. Instead, a simple Latin cross was carved into a stone slab, which was placed at the rear of the cemetery. In Macedonia, a cairn was used in place of a cross to reflect the local custom. In the several Commonwealth cemeteries in the mountains of Italy, Blomfield's design was replaced with a Latin cross made of rough square blocks of red or white stone.\n\nIt is unclear how much it cost to manufacture a Cross of Sacrifice. Generally speaking, however, the cost of building a cemetery was borne by each Commonwealth nation in proportion to number of their war dead in that cemetery.\n\nWhile generally considered a beautiful design, the Cross of Sacrifice is not a robust one. The artwork is susceptible to toppling in high wind, as the shaft is held upright only by a long piece of stone and a single bronze dowel. Should the stone joggle or dowel break, the shaft topples. This problem quickly became apparent in Europe, where a large number of the crosses fell in high winds in the 1920s and 1930s. At one point, the Imperial War Graves Commission considered suing Blomfield for under-designing the artwork, but no lawsuit was ever filed.\n\nVandalism has also been a problem. Crosses of Sacrifice have been smashed or the bronze swords stolen, with the vandalism being particularly bad in the 1970s.\n\nThe Cross of Sacrifice is considered one of the great pieces of war-related art. Its enduring popularity, historian Allen Frantzen says, is because it is both simple and expressive, its abstraction reflecting the modernity people valued after the war. Fabian Ware argued that its greatness was because its symbolism is so purposefully vague: To some, it is a Christian cross; to others, the stone is irrelevant and the sword itself is the cross; and to others, the artwork symbolizes those who sacrificed their lives to the sword. The theme of sacrifice is commonly seen in the piece. Jeroen Geurst points out that Lutyens' War Stone unsettlingly brings to mind images of soldiers sacrificed on the altar of war, while Blomfield's cross speaks about self-sacrifice and the saving grace of Jesus Christ's sacrifice.\n\nThe sword has drawn praise as well. Frantzen notes that the sword can be both an offensive and defensive weapon, which mitigates against an interpretation of the Cross of Sacrifice as a glorification of war. The sword also incorporates elements of chivalry, which was an important value to officers and men during the war. Historian Mark Sheftall agrees that the sword evokes chivalric themes, and argues that by combining the religious and the chivalric with the classical Blomfield created \"a single powerful image\". But the military element has also been criticized. Geurst argues that one may interpret the sword as implying that the Great War was a religious crusade—which it most certainly was not.\n\nThe impact of the Cross of Sacrifice on war memorialization is difficult to underestimate. The IWGC considered the artwork a \"mark of the symbolism of the present crusade\". Cemetery historian Ken Worpole argues that the Cross of Sacrifice \"became one of the most resonant and distinctive artefacts in British and Commonwealth war cemeteries, following the end of World War One.\" First World War historian Bruce Scates observes that its symbolism was effective throughout the Commonwealth, despite widely disparate cultural and religious norms. Historians agree it is the most widely imitated of Commonwealth war memorials, and Sheftall concludes that it has become the archetypal example of Great War commemoration in Britain.\n\nArtistically, the Cross of Sacrifice has been called \"[t]raditional but austere, even stark\". Rudyard Kipling, literary advisor to the IWGC, described it as a \"stark sword brooding on the bosom of the Cross\". This wording appeared in Kipling's poem \"The King's Pilgrimage\".\n\nBy 1937, more than 1,000 of Blomfield's crosses had been erected in France and Belgium. During and after the Second World War, more than 12,000 new war grave sites were created in the United Kingdom. Of these, however, only 416 received a Cross of Sacrifice. Two crosses were erected at Brookwood Military Cemetery in London, due to its unique layout. The first Cross of Sacrifice to be erected after the Second World War was in the cemetery at Great Bircham, Norfolk, in the United Kingdom by George VI in July 1946. The first post-WWII cross erected over a war graves cemetery was at Chouain in the summer of 1948.\n\nOne of the very first examples to be erected was in St Mary's churchyard in Blomfield’s home town of Rye, East Sussex. The construction of the cross is understood to have been supervised by Blomfield himself free of charge and it was unveiled on 19 October 1919.\n\nDuplicates of the Cross of Sacrifice were erected in many places in the United Kingdom, including: Cathays Cemetery, Cardiff, Wales; Peel Green Cemetery, Salford, Greater Manchester; Leigh Cemetery, Wigan, Greater Manchester; Hale Cemetery, Altrincham Greater Manchester; St Lawrence Cemetery, Stratford-sub-Castle, Wiltshire; Eastwood New Cemetery, East Renfrewshire; Rutherglen Cemetery, South Lanarkshire; Cardonald Cemetery, Glasgow; Cathcart Cemetery, Glasgow; Craigton Cemetery, Glasgow; Eastern Necropolis, Glasgow; Lambhill Cemetery, Glasgow; Sandymount Cemetery, Glasgow; Rosebank Cemetery, Edinburgh, Scotland; Cannock Chase Cemetery, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire; Milltown Cemetery, Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Lerwick Cemetery, Shetland.\nSome of the memorials are Grade II listed, such as the cross at St. Johns Cemetery, Margate, Kent. Most of the memorials have the following inscription on the base:\n\nThere is a Cross of Sacrifice at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia. It was proposed in 1925 by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to honour the Americans who joined the Canadian armed forces fighting in Europe. On 12 June 1925, President Calvin Coolidge approved the request, and the monument dedicated on Armistice Day 1927. Attending the ceremony was a guard of honour of more than 200 Canadian soldiers, comprising contingents from The Royal Canadian Regiment, the Royal 22nd Regiment, the pipe band of the 48th Highlanders of Canada and trumpeters from the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery and The Royal Canadian Dragoons. The United States Army was represented by a guard from the 12th Infantry Regiment and buglers from the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. President Coolidge was in attendance and an address was given by Dwight F. Davis, the Secretary of War.\n\nThe inscription on the high gray granite cross is to \"Citizens of the United States who served in the Canadian Army and gave their lives in the Great War\". After the Second World War and the Korean War, similar inscriptions on other faces of the monument were dedicated to the Americans who served in those conflicts.\n\nA Cross of Sacrifice has been erected in a number of cemeteries and other places which are not Commonwealth war cemeteries. Some of the more notable examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These changes were embodied in a further Defence Act that came into effect on 1 April 1972. The Service Boards were abolished and their functions divided between the Chiefs of Staff and a central Defence Headquarters that replaced the Defence Office. The disadvantage of the continued existence of the Service Boards had been one that the one Service could still express its views to the Minister independently of the other Services. Policy formation and planning, logistics and supply, personnel, administration, finance, civil management, and management services were transferred to the central Defence Headquarters. Each Chief of Staff and their separate Headquarters were now only concerned with operational matters.\n\nIn 1989 Defence was separated into two separate bodies – the Ministry of Defence headed by the Secretary of Defence, the senior civilian officer and the New Zealand Defence Force headed by the Chief of Defence Force (CDF), the senior military officer. Both are equally answerable to the Minister of Defence for their individual elements.\n\nUnder the CDF are the three service chiefs who, as the senior officers of their individual services, act as advisors to CDF and provide forces as required.\n\nIn 1999 James Rolfe described in \"The Armed Forces of New Zealand\" the then structure of the Ministry of Defence. It numbered only about 70 people in total, with three divisions involved in policy: Policy Division, Acquisition Division, and Evaluation Division.

Its structure remained relatively static even when the 1938 Social Security Act was passed where the New Zealand government took a larger role in health purchasing. The department remained actively involved in policy (as opposed to purchasing).\n\nBy the 1970s problems had appeared in the health system. The high growth rate in hospital expenditure was occurring at a time when the economy was slowing down. Thus, the government was unable to sustain funding this growth.\n\nThis led the health system to undergo a series of changes over a 20-year period from the 1980s. During the 1990s the National government attempted to stream-line the system in a series of reforms such as separating the government purchasing and provision of health care services. During this time the department was renamed as the \"Ministry of Health\".\n\nThe Labour-Alliance coalition government redefined the role of the Ministry of Health as part of Labour's election promises in the 1999 election.\n\nThe separate government health service purchasing entity, the Health Funding Authority, was merged with the Ministry of Health. Critics were anxious as to how the Ministry would perform as a funder, as they commented that the Ministry had in the past only performed as a policy organisation. However, supporters of this move stated that they believed this would make these agencies more accountable.\n\nThe Ministry of Health funds public health promotions such as smoking cessation and immunisation programmes, as part of the \"New Zealand Primary Health Strategy\" will move towards funding universal access to primary care services for New Zealand citizens. In 2003 the Ministry of Health began forming Primary Health Organisations in an effort to move health care services from fee-for-service arrangements to capitation funding for health professionals who are members of these organisations.\n\nDistrict Health Boards were formed in 2001 as a subsidiary organisation of the Ministry.

Along with \"Countdown Vampires\", it is one of the few survival horror games to revolve around vampires.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the earlier games in the \"Resident Evil\" series; because characters are fully polygonal, whereas the backgrounds are pre-rendered.\n\nComparable to \"Resident Evil\", the gameplay consists of thoroughly exploring a castle, collecting items, keys, and solving puzzles to progress.\n\nThe player character, D, has the ability to walk or run, and can switch between two modes of basic function. \"Battle mode\" and \"search mode.\" The former mode has D unsheathing his sword, with the ability to use an enemy lock-on mechanic, as well as performing basic attack combos and jump attacks with his sword. The latter mode has D's sword sheathed and allows the player to more easily pick up items and search environmental assets, since D is incapable of attacking with his sword outside of \"battle mode.\" D also has the ability to perform a dash attack by running toward an enemy and unsheathing his sword, immediately initiating a powerful sword strike.\n\nThere are also defensive maneuvers D can employ. The game features the ability to block, as well as the ability to dodge enemy attacks in three different directions by double tapping D-pad inputs.\n\nD can also use the Left Hand character to absorb enemies after they've been damaged to a certain degree, unleash a powerful magic attack, and use a healing ability. D's Left Hand works on a meter that drains over time, and absorbing enemies fills the meter that allows D to use these specific powers, which can be toggled in the inventory screen, or by cycling through them with the \"Select\" button during gameplay. D can also earn an extra life once the hand's meter is filled, indicated by a hat and cape icon next to the Left Hand's meter. Upon death, D's hand will revive him, as long as this icon was earned.\n\nThere are two additional meters tied to D's status. An HP (hit points) meter and a VP (vampire power) meter. The HP meter is his basic health status, while the VP meter governs how strong D's attack power is, and how much health D will recover when he uses blood pills - a healing item found fairly commonly throughout the game.\n\n\"Vampire Hunter D\" also employs the aforementioned inventory system. Along with environmental objects, maps, and keys, D can collect sub-weapons to use, such as wooden darts, flash bangs, and hand grenades. D can also collect potions and the aforementioned blood pills. The potions will raise D's HP, but drains his VP. Blood pills will raise both meters. Alternatively, D can raise his VP meter by standing close to enemies and attacking, allowing D to absorb their blood.\n\nThroughout the game, D faces a number of different monsters and boss characters, and can use his sword and sub-weapons to defeat them. There are also seldom, simple platforming segments.\n\n\"Vampire Hunter D\" features three separate endings which can be earned respectively by visiting certain areas, collecting certain items, and making certain decisions throughout the game when prompted to do so. There are also three difficulty modes to choose from, that all vary in the number of healing items D starts with, as well as enemy damage output and enemy health.\n\nThe story of the game is similar to that of the second movie, \"\" (which, in turn, is based on the third novel). Essentially, D, a Dhampir (transliterated as Dunpeal) vampire hunter is hired by an old man named Elbourne to save his daughter Charlotte, who was kidnapped by a vampire, Meier Link. If his daughter was already mutated into a vampiress, then D should kill her humanely. Also, Elbourne's son hired a team of human vampire hunters known as the Marcus Brothers to serve as backup. There are a fairly large number of differences between the film and the game, however. The game's story is more streamlined and the whole of the story largely takes place inside of Camila's castle.\n\nOnly two of the Barbarois mutants (Benge and Mashira) appear as enemies, Caroline being not featured. Borgoff and Leila were the only members of the Marcus brothers which were notably featured, with Leila actually becoming a playable character at one point; Kyle, Nolt, and Grove make few cameos in cutscenes, and later are found dead. There are 3 possible endings based on the player's actions in-game, 1 of which is similar to the end of the film.\n\n\"Vampire Hunter D\" was met with generally mixed to poor reception.\n\nIke Sato of GameSpot criticized the game's control, stating that \"One of the main problems with the game is the control. The addition of jump, guard, and strafe functions may sound like a good idea, but it's actually the cause of the problem.\" In the same review, the game's visuals and animations were also criticized, with the reviewer stating \"The motion of D drawing and putting away his sword is good, but many other animations are poor.\"\n\nFan reception has generally been more positive than critical reception, with \"Vampire Hunter D\" holding aggregate user scores of 7.1/10 and 6.4/10 on IGN and GameSpot, respectively.\n\nChet Barber reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it one star out of five, and stated that \"Being fans of the anime, we really wanted to like the game. But even fans should avoid this at all costs.\"\n\n"}

This was followed by over thirty books including novels, travelogues, plays and biographical works. In the House of Lords, he drew attention to human trafficking as the new slavery.\n\nMaugham was the son of Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham, and Helen Romer. Educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he was expected to follow his father and grandfather into the law. But although he qualified as a barrister, he realised that his real calling was to follow his uncle W. Somerset Maugham as a writer. He also responded against his elite background, turning socialist as a reaction to the spread of fascism in 1930s Europe.\n\nWhen the Second World War looked inevitable, he declined a commission in the Hussars and instead joined up as an ordinary trooper in the 4th County of London Yeomanry tank regiment bound for North Africa. Later, his commanding officer Brigadier Carr recorded in dispatches that Robin Maugham had saved the lives of perhaps 40 men by pulling them from destroyed tanks. At the Battle of Gazala he sustained a severe head wound that resulted in blackouts, which he later joked made him perfect material for a job in intelligence.\n\nAfter a period of convalescence he became the unofficial liaison officer between Winston Churchill and both Glubb Pasha and General Paget. He describes in his first travel book \"Nomad\" (Chapman & Hall 1947) how he dashed across the Levant from one bemedalled dignitary to another. His maverick style proved an effective driving force behind the setting up of the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies (MECAS), corroborated in Leslie McLoughlin's history of British Arabists in the 20th century \"In a Sea of Knowledge\" (Ithica Press 2002). MECAS had a profound effect on diplomatic relations in the Middle East for decades to come. Frustrated by governmental delays, and in a state of exhaustion, he was invalided back to England.\n\nDisillusioned by politics, he turned his mind to writing. His first professional dramatic work appeared at the Chanticleer Theatre in South Kensington (1944). This was followed by a novel, \"Come to Dust\" (Chapman & Hall 1945), written in a hospital bed as a cathartic release from the traumas of war. His first major success came with the publication of a novella entitled \"The Servant\" (Falcon Press 1948), on which was based the classic film \"The Servant\" with Dirk Bogarde and James Fox.\n\nAfter his father died in 1958, he took the title of 2nd Viscount Maugham. His maiden speech in the House of Lords on slavery alerted the world to the continued existence of human trafficking. From this came his book \"The Slaves of Timbuktu\" (Longmans 1961). At the height of his powers, Robin Maugham was a best-selling author with his novels translated into many languages. He wrote over thirty books including novels, travel books, plays, and biographical works such as \"Somerset and all the Maughams\" (Heinemann 1966).\n\nDescribed as \"unashamedely homosexual\", Maugham never married, and the viscountcy became extinct upon his death. He died from a pulmonary embolism, compounded by long-standing diabetes mellitus, although an official cause of death was difficult to obtain as his body was apparently lost for forty-eight hours after his death. He had three sisters: Kate, Honor, and novelist Diana Marr-Johnson (1908–2007). He is buried in Hartfield, Sussex, next to his parents.\n\nMaugham bought the merchant ship \"MV Joyita\" as a hulk in the early 1960s, writing about the mystery of the incident in his book \"The Joyita Mystery\" (1962). The ship had been lost at sea only to reappear five weeks later after a massive search found nothing, without crew or passengers, and with four tons of cargo missing. \n\nHe wrote a candid, critically acclaimed, autobiography, \"Escape from the Shadows\" (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1972), and then a sequel, \"Search for Nirvana\" (1975).\n\nIn the last five years of his life, with the impact of the new movement of working class realism, his popularity began to diminish and his health deteriorated. Robin Maugham died in Brighton in 1981, aged 64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes taught mostly in English, including MBA, executive education, and PhD programmes.\n\nRotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University is ranked among the best business schools in Europe, while ranked in the top 30 in the world for Business and Management Studies according to the \"QS ranking\". RSM is also a member of the Partnership in International Management (PIM) network, and hosts a diverse international student body. In 2013, RSM became part of the Alliance of European and Chinese Business Schools, which is under the patronage of the European Federation of Management Development.\n\nThe roots of RSM stretch back to the founding of Erasmus University as the Dutch School of Higher Commercial Education in 1913. Originally a business-oriented institution, the Dutch School of Higher Commercial Education was a private initiative established with the support of the Rotterdam business community.\n\nIn 1966 Erasmus University (then the Netherlands Institute for Economic Science), commissioned an investigation into the feasibility of founding a Graduate School of Management dedicated to the subject of ‘business administration’. The result, inaugurated in 1969, was the ‘Interfaculteit Bedrijfskunde/Graduate School of Management’, a joint initiative of the schools of economics, law and social sciences of Erasmus University, and the schools of civil, mechanical and maritime engineering and general sciences at the Delft University of Technology.\n\nRotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University first opened its doors in 1970 in the suburb of Kralingen, Rotterdam. The first 30 students began classes in the two-year ‘post-kandidaats’ programme (equivalent to a master's). The school became the first in the Netherlands to offer the degree “Doctorandus in de Bedrijfskunde” post-kandidaats, for students with a university qualification in a non-business discipline.\n\nIn 1972 the school moved to new premises in Delft and was once again remodelled, this time as the Interuniversities Institute for Business Administration (‘Interuniversitair Instituut Bedrijfskunde’ or IIB). It had only one division, the ‘Interuniversitaire Interfaculteit Bedrijfskunde/Graduate School of Management Delft’. In November that year the first 29 students graduated with the new academic degree ‘Doctorandus in de Bedrijfskunde’ (Drs.), and the Alumni Association VIB, the ‘Vereniging van afgestudeerden van de Interfaculteit Bedrijfskunde’ was formally established.\n\nIn 1975 the curriculum was revised and, from 1977 onwards, the focus turned towards the internationalisation of the school. The first exchange programme was established in 1980 with the French Institut Supérieur des Affaires, visited by IIB-students Hans van der Laan and Rino Schreuder. The second exchange programme was established with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1986. The number of English-language modules with an international focus expanded. In 1984 the four-year ‘doctorandus’ programme was launched. The first European CEMS master's degree was conferred in 1991, a result of RSM's assimilation into the renowned CEMS network.\n\nIn 1986 the Graduate School of Management Delft moved back to the premises of Erasmus University, and was renamed the Faculty of Business Administration. The doctoral programme was established in the same year. In 1993 the ERASM research school was founded, bringing together researchers from the Faculty of Business Administration and the School of Economics. It is known today as the Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM).\n\nIn 2003 the BSc International Business Administration programme (IBA) was established, an English-language bachelor (undergraduate) programme which aims to provide a truly international learning experience with a large proportion of students from outside the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1966 a consensus on the lack of suitable training and higher educational facilities for managers in the Netherlands spurred Dutch-based multinationals including Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever and Philips to establish the Foundation for Business Administration (Stichting Bedrijfskunde), which was attached to the Netherlands University of Economics at Rotterdam. This started out as an institute for postgraduate management education, and later became Rotterdam School of Management (RSM).\n\nThe founders of RSM each donated two million guilders and included:\n\nIn 1985 Rotterdam School of Management launched its International Full-time MBA programme, initially offered in both Dutch and English. \nIn 1986 the ‘post-kandidaats’ IMSEC exchange programme was absorbed into the MBA, and a new IMScEC ‘doctorandus’ programme was launched.\n\nIn 2003 RSM joined four schools located in three continents to create the \"Global Executive OneMBA\".\n\nIn 2004 Rotterdam School of Management merged with Erasmus University's Faculty of Business Administration and the Erasmus Research Institute of Management to become Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University (RSM).\n\nIn 2006 the MSc General Management programme was established, a new master's degree for non-business graduates, now called the MScBA Master in Management.\n\nIn 2011 the school appointed Professor Steef van de Velde as dean, who has been re-appointed for a second term in 2015.\n\nIn 2015 RSM opened an office in Chengdu, China. The RSM China office offers services to prospective students, partners, and alumni as well as maintains relationships with research universities and business schools.\n\nIn 2019 the school appointed Professor Ansgar Richter as dean.\n\nThe admission procedure varies for bachelor and master programmes. Bachelor programme in International Business Administration at RSM was the most popular and among the most competitive programmes in the Netherlands, receiving 2,605 foreign student and 767 Dutch student applications for the 550 available places in 2018. The admission to the programme are mostly based on previous academic performance as well as CV and motivation.\n\nFor the master admission candidates are selected based on sufficient background in bachelor studies as well as academic performance, GMAT results and English proficiency.\n\nAccording to the \"Financial Times\", QS and Forbes; RSM is ranked as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough RSM's customised programmes, employees can access the latest in business and management thinking while engaging with some of the world's most influential thought leaders.

Somewhat unusually, the boundary between the two cantons does not lie at the summit of the pass, but some down the slope towards Linthal, with the summit being in Uri.\n\nThe Klausen Pass is crossed by a paved road, which has a length, between Altdorf and Linthal, of . The road approaches the summit from Altdorf via the Schächen Valley communities of Bürglen, Spiringen and Unterschächen, and descends to Linthal via the Urnerboden. The road is normally closed between October and May, due to the high snowfall on the pass. During the open period, a PostBus Switzerland service crosses the pass several times a day, connecting Fluelen station, on the Gothard railway and Lake Lucerne, with Linthal station, the terminus of the railway line through Glarus.\n\nAt the top of the pass is a historic chapel, the \"Bruder-Klaus-Kapelle\", whilst to the west side of, and below, the summit is the \"Hotel Passhohe\".\n\nAs well as being a popular route for cyclists and motorcyclists, the Klausenpass also forms part of the Alpine Pass Route, a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland. However the hiking trail approaches the pass from both sides using a route different from that of the road.\n\nThe Klausen Pass was originally a cattle track, which by 1196 was controlled by a customs office in Bürglen.\n\nAccording to legend, the border between Glarus and Uri was determined in 1315, following prolonged disputes. The two cantons agreed that at first cockcrow, two runners would start from Altdorf and Linthal, respectively, and the border would be where they met. The people of Glarus decided to feed their cock well, so that it might be sympathetic to their cause, while the people of Uri gave theirs nothing to eat at all. The result was that the Glarus cock overslept, while the Uri one, driven by hunger, crowed exceptionally early, and the runner of Uri crossed the entire Urnerboden before the Glarus runner even set out. On the pleading of the Glarus runner, the man of Uri agreed to let him carry him back uphill as far as he could, and the present border between Uri and Glarus is where the Glarus runner fell dead, exhausted from carrying the runner from Uri.\n\nIn 1590, a hospital for travellers was built at Urnerboden, with the maintenance of the pass shared between the cantons of Uri and Glarus. In 1625 Glarus transferred their section of the route to a private individual. In 1717, a chapel was built at the summit, probably dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra. In 1870, a road was built from Altdorf to Unterschächen, and in 1893-99 the road was extended across the pass to Linthal. The building of the road required the demolition of the 1717-built chapel, and the current \"Bruder-Klaus-Kapelle\" was built in 1938.\n\nAn historic hillclimb, almost 14 miles long, known as the Klausenpassrennen.

These paradoxical utterances echo Greek identity riddles, a common poetic form in the Mediterranean. Moreover, it is a non-epistolic, non-narrative unmediated divine speech. There are some translations to the right from the same section of the poem. Line numbering is different in different translations.\n\nAs to dating, Anne McGuire writes: \"\"Thunder, Perfect Mind\" exists only in the Coptic version found at Nag Hammadi (NHC VI,2:13,1-21,32). The author, date, and place of composition are unknown, but a cultural milieu like that of second- or third-century Alexandria is plausible. In any case, it is clear that the text was originally composed in Greek well before 350 C.E., the approximate date of the Coptic manuscript.\"\n\nThe work as a whole takes the form of a poem in parallel strophes, and the author, it may be surmised, has drawn on a tradition of such poems in both Egyptian and Jewish communities, in which a similarly female divinity (Isis or aspect of the divine Sophia respectively) expounds her virtues unto an attentive audience, and exhorts them to strive to attain her. Patricia Cox Miller suggests that it is the \"self-revelation of a powerful goddess\" . \n\nSome examples of the genre may be found in Old Testament, such as the Book of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, or apocryphal literature. \n\nThe riddles of the poem may presuppose a classical Gnostic myth, such as the one found in the Reality of the Rulers, or in the Secret Book of John.\n\nThe original language of the poem was Greek, though only a Coptic version survives in the Nag Hammadi library; the manuscript resides in the Coptic Museum in Cairo.\n"}

A small number of Kapingamarangi speakers are also found on other nearby islands, or in communities around the world to which they have immigrated. Kapingamarangi was first recorded on an expedition in 1557 by Spanish navigator Hernando de Grigalvan (Elbert, 1946).

In the Kapingamarangi language, the vowels can be described as long or short vowels. A long vowel means that the vowel sound is stressed more in a word when spoken and held out for longer. The long vowels are written by writing two of the same letters next to each other. Therefore, the Kapingamarangi language is composed of ten vowels (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nex. ʻʻduliʻʻ bird\nʻʻduliiʻʻ small, little\n\nKapingamarangi vowel phonemes have diphthongs because in Kapingamarangi language, it is possible to have any two vowels next to each other. For example, the word \"eidu\" which means \"spirit\" has a diphthong with the letters /e/ and /i/ (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nThe syllable structure of the Kapingamarangi language is VV, VVV, VCV, CVV, CCVV, CVCV, and CCVCV (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974). In Kapingamarangi, like most Polynesian languages, it is impossible for a word to end in a consonant, but it is possible for there to be two consonants together, as long as it is the same letter.\n\nExample: The term for un-groomed hair is \"libgo wwana\". In this term, the two (W’s) stand together in the word \"wwana\".\n\nThere are three possible word orders in the Kapingamarangi language. The word order of Kapingamarangi is SVO (subject–verb–object), VSO (Verb Subject Object), or OSV (Object Verb Subject), (Elberts, 1948). SVO is the commonly used word order, followed by VSO, and finally OSV is the least used and is a very case in the language. The word order for questions is the same as they are for statements. In research for the grammar of Kapingamarangi, deciphering reasoning or specific uses for the alternative word orders are unsure.\n\nex. Mee gu noho I dono hale.\n\nMorphology is another pivotal element to understanding the grammar of Kapingamarangi. Morphology is the descriptive analysis of words (Elbert, 1948). The morphology of Kapingamarangi is extremely extensive. The word classes in Kapingamarangi are pronouns, possessives, demonstratives, verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives, negatives, particles, conjunctions, and interjections (Elbert, 1948).\n\nMany verbs can take a prefix, but even more verbs take a suffix. For example, a verb may have a prefix like \"haka-\" before a word, and a suffix like \"–ina\" after a word. Like the English language, adjectives follow nouns, and adverbs follow verbs, adjectives, and/or demonstratives. Negatives in Kapingamarangi immediately precede verbs or verb particles (Elbert, 1948). Conjunctions mark serial relationships, and interjections denote emotion (Elbert, 1948).\n\nThe pronouns in Kapingamarangi can be dual (two people), plural (more than two people), inclusive (including the addressee), or exclusive (excluding the addressee). Serial relationships are expressed by the pronoun \"mo\", which means \"and\" (Elbert, 1948). For example, \"David and I\" would be, \"Kimaua mo David\". The pronouns in the Kapingamarangi language are very different from the pronouns in the English language. The pronouns in Kapingamarangi are not gender specific. For example, \"Kinae\" means \"him or her\"; therefore the gender must be translated through the context of a sentence or conversation.\n\nReduplication is a common concept that appears in the Kapingamarangi language, and is relevant to understanding the grammar of Kapingamarangi. Reduplication is the repetition of a root word (Elbert, 1948). The reduplication of Kapingamarangi can be achieved in two different fashions: partial and full reduplication. The fully reduplicated form is generated by the full repetition of the base form, while partial reduplication is generated by partial repetition of the base form (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974). Reduplication usually depicts continued or repeated action (Elbert, 1948). For example, \"tapa\" is a single flash of lightning, while \"tapatapa\" is repeated flashing. In Kapingamarangi, reduplication can be done with the first two syllables, or it can be done with the final two syllables. There is only one word in the lexicon of Kapingamarangi that displays a partially reduplicated form; the word \"baba\" is the only word that is partially reduplicated, and it reduplicates to the word \"babaa\" (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nExamples:\n\nKapingamarangi has access to many different materials. One of the materials that the Kapingamarangi language has access to is an online talking dictionary. It is a dictionary where one can enter a word in English and it will automatically translate it to Kapingamarangi. Many words in this dictionary also have a vocal response on how to pronounce the word, which is why it is called a talking dictionary. This is a resource because it not only provides visual correlations between the English and Kapinga translation for a word, but it also has vocal responses so that scholars of Kapingamarangi can hear a word and how to correctly pronounce it. A Kapingamarangi lexicon was also published by Michael D. Lieber and Kalio H. Dikepa.\n\nKapingamarangi also has access to a variety of books, including dictionaries, books that contain linguistic information, and even books about the atoll of Kapingamarangi. Many native speakers were involved in the translation project that resulted in the Kapingamarangi Bible. These are resources because they are full of information and are highly reliable. Websites like Facebook and YouTube also contain information on Kapingamarangi. The Facebook page is a Micronesia Language Revitalization Workshop page and it contains information about a workshop that was held all throughout Micronesia, including Kapingamarangi. There is a YouTube video of an interview with a speaker who is bilingual in both English and Kapinga and he explains the importance of speaking Kapingamarangi and language revitalization (Heinrich, 2013). There are also selections of poetry in Kapingamarangi (Lewis, Simmons, and Charles, 2013).\n\nIt is likely that Kapingamarangi is being transmitted to children, because Kapingamarangi is in , and the number of speakers keeps increasing. Since the language is taught in schools, it is safe to assume that language is being passed down to the next generation. Since Kapingamarangi has so many resources for people to go to, children have access to a variety of resources to assist their education of the language. Kapingamarangi is not endangered, however it is threatened. The language is taught in schools and churches, but is not used in all domains. According to Ethnologue, Kapingamarangi is taught in primary schools. It is also used at home, in the community, and in churches (Lewis, Simmons, and Charles, 2013). The language is at a current growing state, and might become a language in the near future.\n\n\n\n"}

The RTL Disney Television Limited Partnership was formed in 1995. Super RTL was launched on 28 April 1995. With the Disney-CC/ABC merger led to DTT being split up in April 1996, Walt Disney Television International was transferred to Capital Cities/ABC in that same month. CC/ABC combined the international units, Walt Disney Television International and ACIBG, into Disney–ABC International Television (DAIT) in July.\n\nThe Fun & Action Tour, a Germany-wide roadshow event for children, was started in 1997 featuring TV program characters. The tour was later renamed the Toggo Tour.

It is composed of tin and oxygen where tin has the oxidation state of +2. There are two forms, a stable blue-black form and a metastable red form.\n\nBlue-black SnO can be produced by heating the tin(II) oxide hydrate, SnO·xHO (x<1) precipitated when a tin(II) salt is reacted with an alkali hydroxide such as NaOH.\nMetastable, red SnO can be prepared by gentle heating of the precipitate produced by the action of aqueous ammonia on a tin(II) salt.\nSnO may be prepared as a pure substance in the laboratory, by controlled heating of tin(II) oxalate (stannous oxalate) in the absence of air or under a CO atmosphere. This method is also applied to the production of ferrous oxide and manganous oxide.\n\nTin(II) oxide burns in air with a dim green flame to form SnO.\n\nWhen heated in an inert atmosphere initially disproportionation occurs giving Sn metal and SnO which further reacts to give SnO and Sn metal.\nSnO is amphoteric, dissolving in strong acid to give tin(II) salts and in strong base to give stannites containing Sn(OH). It can be dissolved in strong acid solutions to give the ionic complexes Sn(OH)and Sn(OH)(OH), and in less acid solutions to give Sn(OH). Note that anhydrous stannites, e.g. KSnO, KSnO are also known.\nSnO is a reducing agent and is thought to reduce copper(I) to metallic clusters in the manufacture of so-called \"copper ruby glass\".\n\nBlack, α-SnO adopts the tetragonal PbO layer structure containing four coordinate square pyramidal tin atoms. This form is found in nature as the rare mineral romarchite. The asymmetry is usually simply ascribed to a sterically active lone pair; however, electron density calculations show that the asymmetry is caused by an antibonding interaction of the Sn(5s) and the O(2p) orbitals.\n\nNon-stoichiometry has been observed in SnO.\n\nThe electronic band gap has been measured between 2.5eV and 3eV.\n\nThe dominant use of stannous oxide is as a precursor in manufacturing of other, typically trivalent, tin compounds or salts.

{"id": "2251120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251120", "title": "Law of comparative judgment", "text": "Law of comparative judgment\n\nThe law of comparative judgment was conceived by L. L. Thurstone. In modern-day terminology, it is more aptly described as a model that is used to obtain measurements from any process of pairwise comparison. Examples of such processes are the comparison of perceived intensity of physical stimuli, such as the weights of objects, and comparisons of the extremity of an attitude expressed within statements, such as statements about capital punishment. The measurements represent how we perceive objects, rather than being measurements of actual physical properties. This kind of measurement is the focus of psychometrics and psychophysics.\n\nIn somewhat more technical terms, the law of comparative judgment is a mathematical representation of a discriminal process, which is any process in which a comparison is made between pairs of a collection of entities with respect to magnitudes of an attribute, trait, attitude, and so on. The theoretical basis for the model is closely related to item response theory and the theory underlying the Rasch model, which are used in psychology and education to analyse data from questionnaires and tests.\n\nThurstone published a paper on the law of comparative judgment in 1927. In this paper he introduced the underlying concept of a psychological continuum for a particular 'project in measurement' involving the comparison between a series of stimuli, such as weights and handwriting specimens, in pairs. He soon extended the domain of application of the law of comparative judgment to things that have no obvious physical counterpart, such as attitudes and values (Thurstone, 1929). For example, in one experiment, people compared statements about capital punishment to judge which of each pair expressed a stronger positive (or negative) attitude.\n\nThe essential idea behind Thurstone's process and model is that it can be used to scale a collection of stimuli based on simple comparisons between stimuli two at a time: that is, based on a series of \"pairwise\" comparisons. For example, suppose that someone wishes to measure the perceived weights of a series of five objects of varying masses. By having people compare the weights of the objects in pairs, data can be obtained and the law of comparative judgment applied to estimate scale values of the \"perceived\" weights. This is the perceptual counterpart to the physical weight of the objects. That is, the scale represents how heavy people perceive the objects to be based on the comparisons.\n\nAlthough Thurstone referred to it as a law, as stated above, in terms of modern psychometric theory the 'law' of comparative judgment is more aptly described as a measurement model. It represents a general theoretical model which, applied in a particular empirical context, constitutes a scientific hypothesis regarding the outcomes of comparisons between some collection of objects. If data agree with the model, it is possible to produce a scale from the data.\n\nThurstone showed that in terms of his conceptual framework, Weber's law and the so-called Weber-Fechner law, which are sometimes (and misleadingly) regarded as one and the same, are independent, in the sense that one may be applicable but not the other to a given collection of experimental data. In particular, Thurstone showed that if Fechner's law applies \"and\" the discriminal dispersions associated with stimuli are constant (as in Case 5 of the LCJ outlined below), then Weber's law will also be verified. He considered that the Weber-Fechner law and the LCJ both involve a linear measurement on a psychological continuum whereas Weber's law does not.\n\nWeber's law essentially states that how much people perceive physical stimulus intensity to change depends on that intensity. For example, if someone compares a light object of 1 kg with one slightly heavier, one notices a relatively small difference, perhaps when the second object is 1.2 kg. On the other hand, if someone compares a heavy object of 30 kg with a second, the second must be quite a bit larger for a person to notice the difference, perhaps when the second object is 36 kg. People tend to perceive differences that are \"proportional\" to the size rather than noticing a specific difference irrespective of the size. The same applies to brightness, pressure, warmth, loudness, and so on.\n\nThurstone stated Weber's law as follows: \"The stimulus increase which is correctly discriminated in any specified proportion of attempts (except 0 and 100 per cent) is a constant fraction of the stimulus magnitude\" (Thurstone, 1959, p. 61). He considered that Weber's law said nothing directly about sensation intensities at all. In terms of Thurstone's conceptual framework, the association posited between perceived stimulus intensity and the physical magnitude of the stimulus in the Weber-Fechner law will only hold when Weber's law holds \"and\" the just noticeable difference (JND) is treated as a unit of measurement. Importantly, this is not simply given a priori (Michell, 1997, p. 355), as is implied by purely mathematical derivations of the one law from the other. It is, rather, an empirical question whether measurements have been obtained; one which requires justification through the process of stating and testing a well-defined hypothesis in order to ascertain whether specific theoretical criteria for measurement have been satisfied. Some of the relevant criteria were articulated by Thurstone, in a preliminary fashion, including what he termed the \"additivity criterion\". Accordingly, from the point of view of Thurstone's approach, treating the JND as a unit is justifiable provided only that the discriminal dispersions are uniform for all stimuli considered in a given experimental context. Similar issues are associated with Stevens' power law.\n\nIn addition, Thurstone employed the approach to clarify other similarities and differences between Weber's law, the Weber-Fechner law, and the LCJ. An important clarification is that the LCJ does not \"necessarily\" involve a physical stimulus, whereas the other 'laws' do. Another key difference is that Weber's law and the LCJ involve proportions of comparisons in which one stimulus is judged greater than another whereas the so-called Weber-Fechner law does not.\n\nThe most general form of the LCJ is\n\nin which:\n\n\nThe \"discriminal dispersion\" of a stimulus \"i\" is the dispersion of fluctuations of the \"discriminal process\" for a uniform repeated stimulus, denoted formula_5, where formula_2 represents the \"mode\" of such values. Thurstone (1959, p. 20) used the term discriminal process to refer to the \"psychological values of psychophysics\"; that is, the values on a psychological continuum associated with a given stimulus.\n\nThurstone specified five particular cases of the 'law', or measurement model. An important case of the model is Case 5, in which the discriminal dispersions are specified to be uniform and uncorrelated. This form of the model can be represented as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nIn this case of the model, the difference formula_11 can be inferred directly from the proportion of instances in which \"j\" is judged greater than \"i\" if it is hypothesised that formula_3 is distributed according to some density function, such as the normal distribution or logistic function. In order to do so, it is necessary to let formula_13, which is in effect an arbitrary choice of the unit of measurement. Letting formula_14 be the proportion of occasions on which \"i\" is judged greater than \"j\", if, for example, formula_15 and it is hypothesised that formula_3 is normally distributed, then it would be inferred that formula_17.\n\nWhen a simple logistic function is employed instead of the normal density function, then the model has the structure of the Bradley-Terry-Luce model (BTL model) (Bradley & Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959). In turn, the Rasch model for dichotomous data (Rasch, 1960/1980) is identical to the BTL model after the person parameter of the Rasch model has been eliminated, as is achieved through statistical conditioning during the process of Conditional Maximum Likelihood estimation. With this in mind, the specification of uniform discriminal dispersions is equivalent to the requirement of parallel Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) in the Rasch model. Accordingly, as shown by Andrich (1978), the Rasch model should, in principle, yield essentially the same results as those obtained from a Thurstone scale. Like the Rasch model, when applied in a given empirical context, Case 5 of the LCJ constitutes a mathematized hypothesis which embodies theoretical criteria for measurement.\n\nOne important application involving the law of comparative judgment is the widely used Analytic Hierarchy Process, a structured technique for helping people deal with complex decisions. It uses pairwise comparisons of tangible and intangible factors to construct ratio scales that are useful in making important decisions.\n\n\n"}

Lee Memorial\n\nArlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, formerly named the Custis-Lee Mansion, is a Greek revival style mansion located in Arlington, Virginia, United States that was once the home of Confederate Army General Robert E. Lee. It overlooks the Potomac River and the National Mall in Washington, D.C. During the American Civil War, the grounds of the mansion were selected as the site of Arlington National Cemetery, in part to ensure that Lee would never again be able to return to his home. The United States has since designated the mansion as a National Memorial. \nAlthough the United States Department of the Army controls Arlington National Cemetery, the National Park Service, a component of the United States Department of the Interior, administers Arlington House.\n\nThe mansion was built on the orders of George Washington Parke Custis, the step-grandson and adopted son of George Washington and only grandson of Martha Custis Washington. Custis became a prominent resident of an area that was then known as Alexandria County, at the time a part of the District of Columbia.\n\nArlington House was built at a high point on a 1,100-acre (445 ha) estate that Custis's father, John Parke Custis, had purchased in 1778 and named \"Mount Washington\" (\"Jacky\" Custis died in 1781 at Yorktown after the British surrender). The younger Custis decided to build his home on the property in 1802 following the death of Martha Washington and three years after the death of George Washington. After acquiring the property, Custis renamed it \"Arlington\" after the Custis family's homestead on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.\n\nAlmost immediately, Custis began constructing Arlington House on his land. Hiring George Hadfield as architect, he constructed a mansion exhibiting the first example of Greek Revival architecture in America. Custis intended the mansion to serve as a living memorial to George Washington and a place for his collection of George Washington artifacts. Its design included elements similar to those of George Washington's house, Mount Vernon.\n\nConstruction began in 1803, eleven years after L'Enfant's Plan for the future \"Federal City\" (later called \"Washington City\", then Washington D.C.) had designated an area directly across the Potomac River to be the site of the \"President's House\" (later called the \"Executive Mansion\", now the White House) and the \"Congress House\" (now the United States Capitol). Custis located the building on a prominent hill overlooking the Georgetown-Alexandria Turnpike (at the approximate location of the present Eisenhower Drive in Arlington National Cemetery), the Potomac River and the growing Washington City on the opposite side of the river. Using slave labor and materials on site, and interrupted by the War of 1812 (and material shortages after the British burned the American capital city), Custis finally completed the mansion's exterior in 1818.\n\nThe north and south wings were completed in 1804. The large center section and the portico, presenting an imposing front 140 ft (43 m) long, were finished 13 years later. The house has two kitchens, a summer and a winter. The most prominent features of the house are the 8 massive columns of the portico, each 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter.\n\nGuests at the house included such notable people as Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, who visited in 1824 (see: Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States). At Arlington, Custis experimented with new methods of animal husbandry and other agriculture. The property also included Arlington Spring, a picnic ground on the banks of the Potomac that Custis originally built for private use but later opened to the public, eventually operating it as a commercial enterprise.\n\nCustis married Mary Lee Fitzhugh. Their only child to survive to adulthood was Mary Anna Randolph Custis. Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington and knew Mary Anna as they grew up. Two years after graduating from West Point, Lieutenant Lee married Mary Anna Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between United States Army duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents. After their deaths, Mary's parents were buried not far from the house on land that is now part of Arlington National Cemetery.\nThe Custises extensively developed the Arlington estate. Much of the steep slope to the east of the house became a cultivated English landscape park, while a large flower garden with an arbor was constructed and planted south of the house. To the west of Arlington House, tall grass and low native plants led down a slope into a natural area of close-growing trees the Custises called \"the Grove.\" About to the west of the flower garden, \"the Grove\" contained tall elm and oak trees which formed a canopy. An informal flower garden was planted beneath the trees and maintained by the Custis daughters. It is not clear when \"the Grove\" began to be developed, but it was under way by at least 1853.\n\nUpon George Washington Parke Custis's death in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mary Custis Lee for her lifetime and thence to the Lees' eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee. The estate needed much repair and reorganization, and Robert E. Lee, as executor of Custis's will, took a three-year leave of absence from the Army to begin the necessary agricultural and financial improvements. The will also required the executor to free the slaves on the estate within five years of Custis's death. Robert E. Lee freed the slaves in December 1862, failing to fulfill the 5 year requirement.\n\nIn April 1861, Virginia seceded from the United States. Robert E. Lee resigned his commission in the United States Army on April 20, 1861, and joined the Confederate States Army. With Arlington House on high ground overlooking the capital, the government of the United States knew it must occupy the mansion or be left in an untenable military position. Although unwilling to leave Arlington House, Mary Lee believed her estate would soon be occupied by federal soldiers and left to stay with relatives on May 14, having been warned by her young cousin William Orton Williams, then serving as aide to General Winfield Scott. Union Army troops seized and occupied Arlington without opposition on May 24.\n\nIn June 1862, the 37th United States Congress enacted legislation that imposed a property tax on all land in \"insurrectionary\" areas of the United States. The 1863 amendments to the statute required these taxes to be paid in person. But Mary Lee, afflicted with severe rheumatoid arthritis and behind Confederate lines, could not pay the tax in person. The Arlington estate was seized for nonpayment of taxes. It was auctioned off on January 11, 1864, and the U.S. government won the property for $26,800 ($ today).\n\nDuring the war, Union Army troops cut down many of the trees on the Arlington estate, especially those to the north and east of Arlington House in and near Fort Whipple (north of the house) and Arlington Springs (near the Potomac River). However, a number of large trees remained, particularly those in a forested area (now known as Arlington Woods) west of the house.\n\nBy early 1864, the military cemeteries of Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Virginia, were rapidly filling with war dead. Quartermaster General of the United States Army Montgomery C. Meigs proposed using of the Arlington estate as a cemetery. United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton approved the establishment of a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, creating Arlington National Cemetery. Meigs believed that since Lee had committed treason in deciding to fight against the Union, denying Lee use of the mansion after the war was a rough form of justice. Meigs decided that a large number of burials should occur close to Arlington House to render it unlivable. Officers were to be buried next to the main flower garden south of the house, and the first burial occurred here on May 17. Meigs ordered that additional burials commence immediately on the grounds of Arlington House in mid-June. When Union officers bivouacked in the mansion complained and had the burials temporarily stopped, Meigs countermanded their orders and had another 44 dead officers buried along the southern and eastern sides of the main flower garden within a month.\n\nIn September 1866, the remains of 2,111 Union and Confederate soldiers who died at the First Battle of Bull Run, Second Battle of Bull Run, and along the Rappahannock River were buried on the former site of \"the Grove\", southeast of the mansion, beneath the Civil War Unknowns Monument.\n\nRobert E. Lee made no attempt to visit or restore his title to Arlington before his death in 1870. Mary Lee died in 1873, having visited the house only one more time, a few months before her death. Too upset at its condition, she refused to enter and left after just a few moments.\n\nIn April 1874, Robert E. Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, filed suit against the United States government in a Virginia circuit court to regain his property. Custis Lee was a major general in the Civil War and was captured by Union forces at the Battle of Sailor's Creek on April 6, 1865 (see David Dunnels White). A jury found in favor of Custis Lee, leading to extensive appeals by both parties. In 1882, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of Lee in \"United States v. Lee\", 106 U. S. 196. The court, by a 5–4 majority, found that the estate had been \"illegally confiscated\" in 1864 and ordered it returned. But Lee was less interested in obtaining the estate than he was in a cash compensation for its value. After several months of difficult negotiations, Lee and the federal government settled on a sale price of $150,000 ($ in dollars). Congress enacted legislation funding the purchase on March 3, 1883; Lee signed over the title on March 31; and the title transfer was recorded on May 14, 1883.\n\nIn 1920, the Virginia General Assembly changed the name of Alexandria County to Arlington County to end ongoing confusion between Alexandria County and the independent city of Alexandria. The name Arlington was chosen to reflect the presence of the Arlington estate.\n\nOn March 4, 1925, the 68th United States Congress enacted Public Resolution 74, which authorized the restoration of the Lee Mansion in the Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. The War Department then began to restore Arlington House, and the Department of the Army continues to manage over half of the original plantation's , as Arlington National Cemetery. However, for several years after Congress enacted the authorizing legislation, the War Department, which was responsible for managing the house and grounds, largely ignored the legislation. Contradicting the authorizing legislation, the Department, largely at the insistence of Charles Moore, the director of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, furnished and interpreted the Mansion to “the first half of the republic.” This decision was based, in part, on the popularity of the Colonial Revival movement which was still popular in 1925. The Mansion was restored to the period of George Washington Parke Custis, and no furniture manufactured after 1830 was accepted. This approach negated Lee's role and presence at Arlington.\n\nIn 1955, the 84th United States Congress enacted Public Law 84-107, a joint resolution that designated the manor as the \"Custis-Lee Mansion\" as a permanent memorial to Robert E. Lee. The resolution directed the United States Secretary of the Interior to erect on the premises a memorial plaque and to correct governmental records to bring them into compliance with the designation, \"thus ensuring that the correct interpretation of its history would be applied\". Gradually the house was furnished and interpreted to the period of Robert E. Lee as specified in the original legislation.\nThe National Park Service received jurisdiction over the building and some of adjacent gardens (distinguished from the cemetery) beginning June 10, 1933.\n\nIn 1972, the 92nd United States Congress enacted Public Law 92-333, an Act that amended Public Law 84-107 to designate the manor as \"Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial\".\n\nOne of the lesser known histories about Arlington House concerns the Gray family, who helped to preserve the legacy of George Washington Parke Custis as well as the Lee family. Selina Norris Gray, the daughter of Leonard and Sally Norris, was a second-generation Arlington slave. In 1831, Selina married Thornton Gray, a fellow Arlington slave, and eventually had eight children who grew up at Arlington. With the onset of the Civil War, the Lee family had to evacuate their home before the Union troops came and occupied the property. Even though Selina was a personal maid to Mrs. Lee, she and her family were left behind; however, before leaving, Mrs. Lee left the house keys to Selina and the responsibility to protect the treasures of the home. Several of these treasures included cherished family heirlooms that had once belonged to Mrs. Lee's great-grandmother, Martha Custis Washington, and President George Washington.\n\nWithin months of Union Army General Irvin McDowell occupying the home in 1861, Selina realized that several precious heirlooms were missing due to soldiers looting the property. When she discovered that some of the Washington relics had also disappeared, she promptly provided a list of the missing objects to General McDowell and convinced him that the significance of the collection required his involvement. He first secured the attic and basement areas to prevent further theft, then had the remaining Lee heirlooms shipped to the Patent Office in Washington, D.C for safekeeping. While Selina is credited with saving the heirlooms and treasures of Arlington House, her children later on are credited with helping to restore the home as well as provide accurate details about the layout of the home, personal stories of the Lee family, and help preservationists in the early twentieth century.\n\nDuring major restorative efforts to Arlington House from 1929 to 1930, the Gray family made another important contribution to the history of Arlington County and the nation. Four of Selina and Thornton's daughters provided crucial details about the house and its furnishings, and their input proved vital to the authenticity of the project. In 2014, the National Park Service acquired a rare photograph of Selina.\n\nIn 1995, officials of the United States Department of the Interior and the United States Department of the Army signed an agreement to transfer from Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, to the Army a part of Arlington Woods, which was located in Section 29 of the NPS at Arlington National Cemetery between Arlington House and Fort Myer. The property transfer, which involved of NPS land, was intended to enable the Cemetery to increase its space for burials.\nEnvironmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the remnant of an historically important stand of native trees. Nevertheless, Congress enacted legislation in September 1996 authorizing the transfer.\n\nOn June 5, 2013, after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on a draft environmental assessment (EA) for the Cemetery expansion project, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released a final EA and a signed Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the project. The final EA stated that, of the 905 trees to be removed, 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches. The project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Arlington House had described in 1966. About 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old. At a public hearing on July 11, 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the site and building plans for the project.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007, the National Park Service conducted an archeological excavation of two outbuildings that once held Arlington House's slave quarters. In 2009, the Park Service published reports that described the history of the slave quarters and the findings of the excavations, as well as proposals for the restoration of the quarters.\n\nFrom 2007 through 2013, Arlington House underwent its first renovation since 1925. During that period, the National Park Services placed the House's furnishings on display at the Friendship Hill National Historic Site near Point Marion, Pennsylvania. The Park Service held a rededication ceremony after it had completed the renovation and returned the furnishings to the House.\n\nArlington House suffered significant damage in the 2011 Virginia earthquake, requiring the closure of the back halls and upper floor pending an architectural assessment. On July 17, 2014, philanthropist David Rubenstein donated $12.5 million to the National Park Foundation (the arm of the National Park Service which raises funds through private contributions) to rehabilitate Arlington House, its outbuildings, and grounds. The 30-month project is intended to restore the mansion, buildings, and grounds to the way they looked in 1860. The project will repair the earthquake-damaged foundation, and add new interior lighting and a modern climate-control system. National Park Service officials said they are likely to close Arlington House and the slave quarters for several months in 2016, during which most of the work will be done.\n\nIn 1919, a replica was built for the short-lived Lanier University in Atlanta, designed by architect A. Ten Eyck Brown. It is still standing at 1140 University Drive NE, and houses the Ben H. Zimmerman Religious School and the Canterbury School. Arlington Hall, a two-thirds scale replica of Arlington House, was built in 1939 in Robert E. Lee Park in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe façade of the Old Administration Building in Arlington National Cemetery resembles that of Arlington House. The building is west of Arlington House.\n\n\n\n"}

The character first appeared in Mulawin in 2004. The \"Encantadia\" franchise, consisting of four series \"Encantadia\" (2005), \"Etheria\" (2005–06), \"\" (2006), and \"Encantadia\" (2016), is primarily focused on Pirena's quest to get the throne of the Lireo from her sister Amihan. Pirena is portrayed by actress Sunshine Dizon on the first 3 series, and in the spin-off movie , while Glaiza de Castro portrayed the character in the 2016 series of the same name.\n\nIn \"Encantadia\", Pirena is the daughter of Mine-a, the fourth queen regnant of Lireo, and Hagorn, the king of Hathoria. As the eldest among the four Sang'gre daughters of a Lirean queen, she grew up believing that she is the rightful successor to her mother's throne. She is greatly resentful and jealous of her younger sister Amihan, whom she believed was Mine-a's favorite. Though she has a loving and compassionate side to her, the consistent manipulations of her \"dama\" (nanny) Gurna, a half Lirean and half Hathorian spy, ultimately turned her against her mother and sisters. She lost to Amihan during the final stage of the queen selection organized by her mother. However, she contested the result of the trials and refused to acknowledge Amihan's succession as the next queen. She ended up defecting from Lireo, stealing the fire gem, and forming an alliance with the Kingdom of Hathoria to bring Amihan's downfall.\n\n\"Encantadia\" writer, Suzette Doctolero coined the name \"Pirena\" from English word, \"fire\" as Pirena is the keeper of Gem of Fire. In the series, four gems of nature referred as \"Brilyante\" (Gems) control balance in their world: the air, fire, water and earth.\n\nThe character made its first appearance in Mulawin TV series.\n\nPirena is the oldest of the four daughters of Mine-a. Her father's identity was kept secret from her until Hagorn, her father confessed the truth from whom her powers of shapeshifting and swiftness in battle are believed to have been inherited. Naturally proud and gifted with a keen intelligence, Pirena believes that Amihan stole the throne of Lireo as well as the affections of their mother Mine-a from her. Pirena looks upon her hand-maiden Gurna as a confidant. Though outwardly cold, Pirena is actually a kind person however, her kindness was often consumed by the brainwashing of Gurna. Impulsive and willful, Pirena is very transparent with her emotions. She is the most frank and brutally honest of the sisters, sometimes inconsiderate of the effect of her words to those around her. Because they share so many of the same personality traits, she always ends up quarreling with Danaya. Since she was young, she has the ambition to become the next queen of Lireo. This ambition of hers blinds her from seeing what is right and what is wrong and treating her sisters as merely rivals who stand no chance against her. Pirena's weapon are two daggers that can be comibined into one: the longer sword is called \"\"baga\"\"(flame) and the shorter one is called \"\"siklab\"\"(spark).\n\nThe evil Ravenum summoned Pirena, Encantadia's \"Punong Diwata ng Apoy” (Head of Fire Fairies).\n\nPirena at a young age already dreams of becoming the next queen of Lireo. Gurna used this ambition of hers to make her think Amihan is her rival to the throne. Proud and cunning, she has always believed the throne was her birthright. She felt hurt and betrayed upon overhearing a conversation between Mine-a and Imaw in which the queen expressed that she would rather that any of her daughters ascend the throne other than Pirena. When she was lost to Amihan in a battle organized by their mother for the throne, Pirena had an outburst of emotions. She can't accept her loss and challenged her mother for a battle. Pirena then stolen the Gem of fire and left Lireo to find allies in the Hathoria Kingdom. Her theft made Mine-a decide to separate the remaining gems by giving each to her other three daughters for safe-keeping. Pirena immediately seeks an alliance with Hathoria and as a gift, used the fire gem to rekindle the fires of their forges. Hagorn, the king of Hathoria welcomed her and she joined their campaign to conquer Encantadia. After Mine-a had died, she went back to Lireo and asked forgiveness with her sister, unaware of the true reason of her comeback. She organized a coup-de-etat against Queen Amihan, and ascend the throne of Lireo, not knowing that her father has trick her at all.\n\nA prophecy by Ether was established a long time ago that if the last keen of the diwatas was born, the fallen Kingdom of Etheria will rise again. When Cassandra, granddaughter of Amihan was born, the prophecy became true and the fallen Kingdom poses a threat to now peaceful Encantadia. Pirena, who had a change of heart and sided with her sisters went back to the past to revert the prophecy by changing the history. Pirena headed their fight against the four Herans of Etheria in which they gain victory with the help of the \"\"Inang brilyante\"\". The Herans of Etheria, tried to convince and manipulate her to rebuild the then fallen Kingdom of Hathoria, but her love of her sisters and her mother kept her away from them.\n\nBecause of the defeat of the Etherians, Ether flew around her kingdom which was all destroyed to find the Four herans. She found them all and kept their spirits in a crystal ball and brought them to the future. The Crystal ball broke and their spirits became free. They practiced fighting and planned to steal the four gems so Etheria may once again rise back in glory. Pirena fought against the Etherians once again to keep the gems in their territory. After the fight between them and the Etherians, Pirena was never seen again the Kingdom of Lireo and believed to have vanished with her other sisters after destroying Hathoria with the Fire Gem.\n\nThe 2016 series is a reboot (often called as \"requel\" or retelling-sequel) to the 2005 fantasy series with the same name. It is the fourth series of the Encantadia franchise and is 11 years apart from the third one. It features the same character and story of Pirena with the 2005 series. It was portrayed by actress Glaiza de Castro who auditioned for the role, and had months of trainings in battle.\n\nGlaiza De Castro portrays again Pirena which follows her aftermath appearance in Encantadia requel\n"}

{"id": "2251152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251152", "title": "Illbleed", "text": "Illbleed\n\nIllbleed is a survival horror video game developed by Crazy Games for the Sega Dreamcast. It was self-released in Japan in March 2001, and published by AIA in North America in April 2001.\n\nEven though it was financially unsuccessful, \"Illbleed\" received a cult following for its notable combination of nonlinear gameplay elements and its \"B movie\"-style comedy horror theme, dialogue, and voice acting.\n\n\"Illbleed\" is a survival horror game. The game consists of six stages represented as movie theatres. The goal of the game is to complete each stage by fulfilling their unique objectives. Each stage has traps and enemies designed to kill the player. The player begins with Eriko Christy and can rescue and recruit more playable characters as they progress including Kevin Kertsman, Randy Fairbanks, and Michel Waters. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA Horror Monitor is available near the beginning of each stage. The Horror Monitor allows the player to detect and mark areas for potential traps, items, and enemies at the cost of adrenaline. Traps attack in various different ways, resulting in blood loss, the rise of pulse, and lowered stamina, in addition to the enemies. The player is given tools and items to prevent the character from bleeding to death, running out of strength or adrenaline, or being scared to death. If the player fails to keep the character alive through the course of the level, they must be revived outside of the level and continue the level with another available character. If there are no remaining characters, the game ends and must be restarted from the previous save point.\n\nWhen engaging enemies, the player is not allowed to exit the battlefield until the enemies are cleared out. If the player tries to go beyond the battlefield, it will flash blue. Successful escape clears out the enemies. Each character has four senses: sight, hearing, smell and a sixth sense. Each time the player gets near items or traps, one or multiple senses will register on the meter located on the top of the screen and these senses are indicated like a heart monitor. The player may utilize the horror monitor, which consumes adrenaline, to mark the spots suspected of hoarding items, traps or lurking enemies. Any spot marked will display a glowing blue orb, which the player can survey. Some traps can be successfully defused this way, and the spent adrenaline will be returned to the character.\n\nItems may be found throughout levels, purchased at Bloody Mary Drugstores located in the amusement park, or obtained as the plot unfolds. Some items restore, reduce or raise the upper limit of certain character stats; unused items will be carried to the next level. There are also upgrade items that can be used at emergency rooms in the game.\n\nAs the games begins, the players are introduced to horror-aficionado Eriko Christy, who is delivering a speech detailing the struggles she faced as a child, being the daughter of a horror theme park designer. In this speech, she reveals that her father would delight in \"testing\" out all of his new horror props and gimmicks on her; Eriko's mother filed for divorce, and took the then six year old Eriko with her, estranging the relationship between Eriko and her father.\n\nAfter Eriko's speech, she gathers with her three friends Kevin, Randy, and Michelle. They praise Eriko on her speech and reassure her that she will most certainly win the high school speech contest. During this encounter, Michelle reveals she received four tickets to a recently opened horror theme park - \"Illbleed\". An absurd reward of $100,000,000 is offered to anyone who can successfully reach the end of the park. Eriko declines the invitation, assuming it's a cheap stunt for publicity and decides to stay behind, as her three friends excitedly set out for the park, leaving Eriko with her ticket.\n\nAfter a few days without hearing from her friends, Eriko decides to investigate the park herself to determine if her friends are indeed still trapped within it. This is where the game begins.\n\nAfter the levels are all completed, Eriko is forced to venture into the \"Michael Reynolds' Horror Museum.\" She fights one of three bosses that Michael Reynolds, the creator of Illbleed and the main antagonist, has set up for them in order to complete the game. The number of friends saved will determine the ending of the game.\n\nIf all three friends and Jorg are saved, the best ending consists of Eriko and friends (except Jorg) at a beach enjoying themselves and trying to decide what to do with their prize money. Eriko suddenly states that she is going back to Illbleed and tells them not to follow, despite their enthusiasm to return with her.\n\nIf Eriko fails to rescue a friend, the bad ending comes with the camera scrolling through the park, an older Eriko speaking in the background saying she got the prize money, but lost her friend(s) in the process, saying she would give up the money to bring back her friends. The screen ends with the camera closing up on a grave of her dead friend.\n\nIf the player finishes the game a second time, and does not save anyone, (including Jorg which means the player won't get the bonus cash in the killerman stage) the true ending is shown. Eriko finds out that the mastermind behind Illbleed, Michael Reynolds, is actually her father. Reynolds reveals that his true intention is solely to scare Eriko after being unable to do so when she turned six. A fight ensues with Eriko emerging as the victor and commenting on how Reynolds \"destroyed himself\" and \"scared the living hell out of her\".\n\nAfter the credits roll, a picture shows Kevin and Eriko embracing with Kevin announcing that he is taking over as club president as Eriko has become a very timid person after her second visit to Illbleed and refuses to visit another horror house. He further explains that she needs protection now and that he would be the one to provide it. The game ends with a close-up of an invitation ticket to \"The Arcade\" which has a similar layout and appearance to the Illbleed invitations as seen in the opening scene.\n\n\"Illbleed\" was developed by Crazy Games. The game was directed by Tetsuro Sugimori with Shinya Nishigaki serving as producer and writer. The game was released in Japan on March 29, 2001, and in North America on April 16, 2001. It is the only Dreamcast game that had an official Chinese version, released on January 15, 2002, by publisher Mr.Game. A Hong Kong game magazine at the time was responsible for the translation work. After numerous delays and rumors of cancellation, the Traditional Chinese version was released 10 months after the original Japanese release. 300 copies were released in Taiwan and it came in a boxset, which included the outer box, the game itself and a 2002 calendar in a CD jewel case.\n\nAn enhanced Xbox release was planned, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"If you love horror movies, or just want something different in a survival horror game, there's enough good stuff here to make it worth overlooking the annoying parts.\"\n\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n"}

Michael Straczynski becoming de facto head writer. Plans to bring the series back, set 28 years after the first series, were announced in July 2016. Goddard Film Group, headed by one of the original series co-creators, Gary Goddard, is one of the development team of the new series.\n\nThe storyline was set on Earth in the 22nd century following the Metal Wars, a cybernetic revolt that resulted in the subjugation of the human race by intelligent machines. Captain Jonathan Power and a small group of guerrilla fighters, called the \"Soldiers of the Future\", oppose the machine forces that dominate Earth.\n\nEach episode began with the following introduction, plus a recap of the storyline:\n\n\"\"Power on.\"\" Actor Timothy Dunigan, outfitted in his character's full regalia (one of the \"Power Suits\" of exoskeletal armor that Robert Short Productions artificed for the cast), turned to the camera and delivered this line.\n\nVoiceover artist Brad Crandall:\nBy the year 2132, advanced robotic soldiers known as \"Bio-Mechs\" had replaced humans in the armed forces of the world's nations. The existence of Bio-Mechs meant that wars could be fought without significant loss of life, allowing turning war into a nearly harmless battle between machines. A group of scientists, led by Dr. Stuart Gordon Power (Bruce Gray), had begun working on an advanced supercomputer, called OverMind\",\" capable of overriding the control systems which the world's armed forces used to operate the Bio-Mechs, and thus stop them, bringing an end to war. It required an equivalent to human brain patterns to become operational. But Dr. Power's closest associate, Dr. Lyman Taggart (David Hemblen), became impatient with the slow pace of the project and hooked himself up to the system, bringing the supercomputer to operational status.\n\nWith the new opportunities offered by the human-machine combination, Taggart becomes obsessed with the precision and \"perfection\" of machines and convinces himself that merging human consciousness with mechanical bodies is the next step in human evolution. OverMind achieves self-awareness and shares Taggart's beliefs as they take over Bio-Mech armies throughout the world and attack humanity in a conflict known as the Metal Wars.\n\nWorld governments turn to Dr. Power for find a way to stop Taggart. He develops the \"Power Suits\", a combination of exoskeletal body armor and advanced weapons and prepares a number of prototypes for testing. However, Power apparently dies trying to rescue his son Jonathan from Taggart, though Jonathan is convinced that his father is still alive somewhere. Taggart himself is severely wounded, and OverMind saves him by implanting cybernetic mechanisms into his body, eventually calling himself Lord Dread.\n\nBy 2147, fifteen years after the Metal Wars broke out, humanity had been largely annihilated by Lord Dread's forces, and those who survive live miserable existences in hiding lest they be discovered by Bio-Mechs and \"digitized\" as virtual beings within OverMind. Advanced Bio-Mechs called Bio-Dreads and humans loyal to Dread carry out the extermination, as Dread rules from his headquarters in Volcania, somewhere in North America. In episode 8 \"and study war no more\", the location of Volcania is announced as being in \"sector 9 by 6\". The computer map shows its location near the Great Lakes region of North America.\n\nDespite the dire situation, a number of human forces band together and fight the Bio-Dread Empire. One of the leading human resistance groups, Jonathan Power's \"Power Team\", uses his father's Power Suits to mount attacks on Bio-Dread forces. They stage out of the \"Power Base\", an abandoned NORAD installation in the Rocky Mountains, and are guided by a supercomputer programmed with Mentor\",\" an artificial intelligence designed by Dr. Power in his own image and voice to guide his son and the group. It is later revealed that there are human resistance groups in other locations.\n\nDuring the show's only season, there was a story arc involving Project New Order\",\" Lord Dread's plan to eradicate human life and develop his ideal world. The plan consisted of four stages:\n\n\nCaptain Power's group uses a system of teleportation portals, called \"transit gates\", both to move quickly around North America and to keep their base's location secret. However, at the conclusion of the first season, Lord Dread breaks the gates' access codes and sends forces to assault the base. Power and most of his team escape the facility, but Corporal Jennifer \"Pilot\" Chase, a former member of the \"Bio-Dread Youth\", is trapped and activates the base's self-destruct mechanism, killing herself and the Bio-Dread troops.\n\nJ. Michael Straczynski was the writer of the last episode of the series. He commented about Pilot's death, revealing that the scene was inspired by an especially tragic event in his own past.\n\n\"I've never talked about this before—said I was in a thoughtful mood—but I've known several people, friends, who've taken their own lives. In one case, I spoke to her just beforehand. Tried, through the phone lines, to reach her one more time, pull her back from the edge. I couldn't. Years pass. Time comes for me to write the last filmed episode of \"Power.\"\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"Jennifer Chase is going to die, partly of her injuries, partly of her own volition. Part of my life went into that scene, in the way it was constructed, and what was said. And what was not said, what never had the chance to be said, and thus still burns. I knew that, at the crucial moment of that scene, he couldn't be near her, as I wasn't near my friend...it had to be long-distance, hearing but not seeing her, and the terrible pain of arriving too late. I cannot watch that episode without crying. Ever.\"\nThe second season focuses on an anguished Captain Power neglecting his duties as the leader of the team and obsessed with killing Dread and Locke, the slicer who had betrayed them in the previous season finale, to avenge Pilot's death. Major Hawk would have assumed more leadership roles as Power goes off on his vendetta. Two characters were to have been introduced: Chris \"Ranger\" O'Connor, a woman who would be Tank's love interest; and Private Chip \"TNT\" Morrow, a soldier who had appeared in the first season under the name of Andy Jackson.\n\nThe plot also covered the team's quest to find \"Eden II\", a supposed secret human refuge mentioned in the first season, while setting up a base of operations on a facility that was the prototype of the Power Base. Lord Dread would have gained a new mechanical form, as actor David Hemblen was not required back let alone, perhaps, for voice work. His new army would have consisted of \"Hunter-Seeker\" troops and a new Warlord-class Bio-Dread called Xenon. Dread would also have gained a new assistant called Morgana II, a machine with the mind of his former lover – who would have proven to be Jonathan Power's mother.\n\nOverMind would have taken a larger role in the war and revealed a hidden agenda: after digitizing all the remaining human beings, it would erase them from existence. Wanting to keep this secret from Dread, the plot would have seen the AI give Soaron secret programming to assassinate Lord Dread in case he suspected anything.\n\nIn the recent DVD release, series head writer J. Michael Straczynski reveals that the planned end for the series was Lord Dread learning of OverMind's hidden agenda, and as a result, teaming up with Captain Power to free all of humanity from OverMind.\n\nA great majority of the show's story line was filled with romance and intrigue, which was made for the adults who watched the show with their children. Thus, the story was filled with romantic kisses, sexual innuendo, and occasionally scenes which implied sexual encounters between characters. Mild profanity was also present; \"damn\" was said on at least one occasion, and Pilot told Blastarr to \"go to hell\" in response to his order to surrender. In addition, the violent death of one of the major ongoing characters in the series (detailed above) was also an unusual development for a children's series. The inclusion of a \"Bio-Dread Youth\", which recruited young survivors to Lord Dread's ideals to further advance his agenda, also paralleled fascist regimes.\n\n\"Captain Power\" attempted to appeal to both children and adult audiences, with its dark, post-apocalyptic storyline showing the aftermath of nuclear war and featured allegories on topics such as Nazism. Ultimately, this became the show's undoing. It was seen as too violent for children because of its toys for shooting at the television and live-action violence. Its less mature aspects, such as the title, drove away adult audiences. Other factors contributing to the show's failure included the higher cost of a live-action show (each episode cost an estimated $1 million to produce) compared to the cheaper production costs of a cartoon, as well as the fact that the gameplay between the show and the toys was extremely poor. Poor transmission time-slot choices also contributed to the show's cancellation: it was sold to syndication as opposed to a regular network time-slot, which resulted in some television stations airing it in the 5:00-6:00 AM time-slot on Sunday mornings. The subsequent poor ratings hastened the show's demise. In an article from \"Starlog\" #128 written by Marc Shapiro with quotes from one of the writers of the show, Larry DiTillio, there are the following statements:\nBut for all those noble sentiments,\" Captain Power,\" to the public at large, is perceived as just another excuse to sell toys. It is a notion that rubs story editor Larry DiTillio the wrong way.\n\n\"We're not writing stories with the idea of turning each episode of\" Captain Power \"into a video game,\" declares DiTillio. But DiTillio, a first season staff writer who became story editor when J. Michael Straczynski (\"Starlog \"#111) left the position for a similar post with the revived\" Twilight Zone, \"claimed that ramrodding the script side of\" Captain Power \"hasn't been easy.\n\n\"This show has definitely not made my life easier,\" chuckles DiTillio. \"This is not just another kid's cartoon show. The writing is always to an adult level. There is the interactivity which has been centered mainly in the battle sequences but we aren't in a position of having to write X amount of animation and interactivity into each episode. I want to make it very clear that around here, we're working for the story.\"\n\nThere is a tone of desperation in DiTillio's voice as he defends the writing integrity of\" Captain Power.\" It's a desperation resulting from dealing with cliché story submissions that have come streaming in amid the confusion about how childlike or adult\" Captain Power\" is. \"People are coming in with the same old stories,\" DiTillio laments. \"I'm getting\" Star Trek,\" \"Star Wars\" and \"Terminator.\" If I wanted another\" Terminator,\" I would call James Cameron.\"\n\nIn a subsequent \"Starlog\" article a year after the cancellation, DiTillio cited many reasons for Mattel cutting off the show's funds, resulting in the show's cancellation: \"Mattel's tie-in toys didn't sell up to expectations, parents group charges that the show was too violent, and having to shell out Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild residual payments because \"Captain Power\" was live-action.\"\n\nJ. Michael Straczynski commented about the show's cancellation and the planned second season.\n\nRe: Captain Power \"...Yeah, that's a show that is an example of what to strive for, and how sometimes good intentions can get derailed. We genuinely wanted to come up with a long-term story, and by and large, we succeeded. The problem was the marketing in front of the show, and the merchandising behind the show...we got killed from both sides.\"\n\"There's an entire second season of unproduced\" CP\" scripts, story edited by Larry DiTillio, in which he follows up on the arc that I and others established during the first season. You would have found out what Dread became, what happened to Power's mother, where Eden was (and there would be direct contact), what the secret was in Soaron's programming, and so on.\"\n\nIn 1987, \"Captain Power\" was one of the targets of anti-toy related children's television advocates who claimed that the series focused on selling children expensive toys for full participation.\n\nA line of toys and interactive television games were released by Mattel. Some ships and playsets, when firing at the screen, could interact with various segments of the Saturday morning TV program.\n\nThe first interactive toy and game for the series was a toy XT-7 jet with a video cassette. There were three tapes: \"Future Force Training\", \"Bio-Dread Strike Mission\", and \"Raid On Volcania\". The tapes featured live introduction and end segments with the cast of the television show. The actual mission itself was animated and took place in the jet cockpit from the first-person point of view of the pilot/player. Players would hold the toy jet and face the screen. The toy was actually a sort of light gun that responded to signals from the television playing the tape. The toy jet would get points by firing at appropriate targets on the screen and lose points when the sensor on the jet got \"hit\". Upon reaching zero points, the cockpit would eject automatically. Since the \"game\" was only a VHS tape, the missions always played out the same way. The toy could also interact with the live action television broadcast in the same manner. Other interactive objects in this series were the \"Phantom Stryker\" Bio-Dread ship, the \"Interlocker Throne\" for Lord Dread, which consisted of a stationary tank on a tripod and an optional target viewer that could be taken on and off, and the \"Power On\" platform, which the user could plug the Captain Power figure into. Whenever the transformation was triggered on screen or the base was fired at by one of the other vehicles, the toy would immediately trigger the \"Power On\" sequence causing the chest of the figure to glow.\n\nThe toys also had the ability to interact with each other, similar to the Laser Tag toys popular at the time. When played in this way, each toy had a limited number of hit points, but any points earned by playing against the television show increased this total.\n\nIn 1988, a second and slightly more scarce series was released. The release of the Dread Trooper and Dread Commander is uncertain. Pictures of these figures were shown in the Mattel dealer catalog.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\nScripts for a second season were commissioned and written, but the season was never produced. Twenty-two scripts were assigned, but that number was later reduced to 18.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n\nA promotional video produced months before the series aired featured a sixth \"Soldiers of the Future\" member: Colonel Nathan \"Stingray\" Johnson, a specialist in seaborne operations. In the recent DVD release, series creator Gary Goddard reveals that the character of \"Stingray\" Johnson was cut shortly before the series went to production, simply because Landmark Entertainment was unable to afford to build a water tank to film aquatic battles.\n\n\nThe show also spurred a short-lived comic book of the same name, published by Continuity Comics in 1988–1989, illustrated by Neal Adams with stories by J. Michael Straczynski, who was also the series story editor, writing half the episodes and providing stories or outlines for many more.\n\nThe official \"Captain Power\" page on Facebook announced on September 9, 2011 that the complete series would be released on DVD.\n\nOn December 6, 2011 the complete series was released on a 4-disc DVD set in region 1. The set contains all 22 episodes plus much bonus material including interviews and commentaries with cast members.\n\nOn September 28, 2012, \"Ain't It Cool News\" announced that series creator Gary Goddard was in the process of reviving the series. The new series project, titled \"Phoenix Rising\", uses the original rising phoenix symbol of the \"Captain Power\" franchise, though the motif has been slightly altered. The series would be a one-hour weekly drama, looking at both sides of the post-apocalyptic conflict, starting with the origins of characters (which were only touched upon halfway through the first season). As of September 29, 2012, no networks or cable channels have been announced as being a part of the project, nor have any casting choices been revealed. On board with the project are writer/producers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, who have been tapped to develop the revival/reboot of the franchise. Stephan Martinière is heading up the conceptual art for the show. A 2014 interview revealed that, despite delays, the revival is still in the works. In September 2015, \"Deadline\" reported work on the reboot was still progressing.\n\nAn announcement teaser for the new series was uploaded to YouTube on July 18, 2016, with the show making an appearance at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nThere is a video game for \"Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future\", published by Box Office Software in 1987 for the PC, and 1988 for Commodore 64.\n\n"}
