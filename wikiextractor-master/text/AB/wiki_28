It is described as resembling a dragon and is the subject of a number of regional legends, some which are said to date back to the 13th century.\n\nMany people treat the existence of Brosnya skeptically and say that the creature may be a mutant beaver or a giant pike of 100–150 years. Others conjecture that groups of wild boars and elks cross the lake from time to time.\n\nThere are some more scientific hypotheses concerning Brosnya. One of them is a gas version saying that when hydrogen sulfide goes up from the lake bottom it makes water boil up; this boiling in its turn resembles a dragon head. But the amount of hydrogen sulfide must be considerable to produce this effect. Other version says that there is a volcano in Lake Brosno that makes ejections on the water surface from time to time. It is well known that there are several fractures at the bottom of the lake, the depth and the direction of the fractures cannot be defined. It is not ruled out that the volcano crater is inside of one of the fractures. This explains why the volcano, if it actually exists, has not been discovered yet. See limnic eruption.\n\nFishermen say that the underwater world of Lake Brosno has a structure of several levels. From time to time, burbots and yellow perch can be found in the lake. For example, herring can be found in a lake in Peno District in the Tver Region. Some consider it strange that sea fish may live in the lake at all. Smelt shoals can be found in Lake Brosno as well. The phenomenon of Brosnya can be explained from the physical point of view: huge smelt shoals are reflected on the water surface through refraction of light and produces the effect of a huge reptile head. Physicists say that any mirage appears in hot weather. Indeed, witnesses say that they came across Brosnya in summer. However, the origin of the rumors of this strange monster remain a mystery.\n\nRumors of a strange, giant creature living in Lake Brosno have existed for several centuries. One legend says that the lake monster scared to death the Tatar-Mongol army that headed for Novgorod in the 13th century. Batu Khan stopped the troops on the sides of Lake Brosno to rest. Horses were allowed to drink water from the lake. However, when the horses ventured down to the lake, a huge roaring creature emerged from the water and started devouring horses and soldiers. The Batu-khan troops were so terrified that they turned back, and Novgorod was saved. Old legends describe an \"enormous mouth\" devouring fishermen. Chronicles mention a \"sand mountain\" that appeared on the lake surface from time to time. According to another legend, some Varangians wanted to hide stolen treasure in the lake. When they approached the small island, a dragon came to the surface from the lake and swallowed the island up.\n\nIt was rumored in the 18th and 19th centuries that the giant creature emerged on the lake surface in the evening, but immediately submerged when people approached. It is said that during World War II the beast swallowed up a German airplane. There are witnesses who say they chanced to see Brosnya walking in the water. Locals say that it turns boats upside-down and has to do with the disappearances of people.\n\n"}

Donatos is also served at several venue outlets including Ohio Stadium and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\n\nIn 1963, Ohio State sophomore Jim Grote purchased the original Donatos located on the south side of Columbus, Ohio, for $1,300. Grote's business principles included: creating a superior product, hiring great people, and to \"treat others the way I would like to be treated\". These principles led to the creation of the official brand promise \"To serve the best pizza and make your day a little better.\"”\n\nIn 1991, the Donatos Pizza in Zanesville, Ohio, opened as the company's first franchise location. As of 2019, there are about two dozen franchisees operating more than 100 Donatos Pizza locations in ten states: Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n\nIn 1999, Donatos was purchased by McDonald's in an attempt to enter the pizza industry. A majority interest in Donatos was repurchased by Jim Grote and daughter Jane Grote Abell in 2003 as McDonald's sought to refocus on its core business. During this period Donatos also had operations in Munich, Germany.\n\nIn 2017, Donatos founder Jim Grote led a $1 million seed round in BeeHex, the 3D-food printing company with NASA origins.\n\nDonatos is known for its thin crust pizza \"loaded Edge to Edge\" with toppings, particularly its large pepperoni pizza that includes 100+ pepperoni slices. In 2009, Donatos launched a hand-tossed pie-cut crust option. In 2004, the company introduced Donatos take and bake pizza in Kroger supermarkets. In 2015, they introduced NatureCrust, a 10” organic, non-GMO, vegan, multi-grain crust, which is now available in a handful of locations. Donatos also offers a variety of oven-baked subs, freshly made salads, chicken wings, shareable sides, and desserts.\n\nIn 2013, Donatos was the subject of an episode of the CBS reality television show \"Undercover Boss\".

Each of these townships bordered Wales, with the River Ceiriog and the River Dee forming the border. However, in 1870, the townships of Weston Rhyn and Bronygarth were formed into the new Parish of Weston Rhyn.\n\nThe church at St Martin's is dedicated to St Martin of Tours and the parish was part of the Welsh Diocese of St Asaph until 1922 when it was transferred to the English Diocese of Lichfield.\n\nThe area was, for centuries, under the influence of nearby Chirk Castle and, later, the Trevor family of Brynkinallt () in Chirk.\n\nAlthough the population of the parish involved can be found under Ellesmere Rural an electoral ward still exists in its own name. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,333.\n\nAround the 16th century, a bridge was built across the River Ceiriog at Pontfaen as part of the Chester to Cardiff highway. Later the A5, the London-Shrewsbury-Holyhead trunk road was constructed by Thomas Telford through the parish of St Martin's, crossing into Wales via the bridge at Chirk Bank.\n\nThe Glyn Valley Tramway ran from Chirk through Pontfaen into the Ceiriog Valley.\n\nIn the 19th century a canal was constructed through St Martin's Moor by Thomas Telford linking the industrial areas around Ruabon to the canal network. This now forms part of the Llangollen Canal.\n\nBy 1848 the Chester to Ruabon railway line had been extended south to Shrewsbury, but only one station, Preesgweene () (later known as ), was built in St Martin's parish. Later however, branch lines were built to link the collieries in the area to the main rail network.\n\nAlthough predominantly an agricultural area, coal was mined in St Martin's for several centuries. The collieries at Ifton, Chirk Bank, Quinta, Trehowell, Moreton Hall and Preesgweene were, geologically, an extension of the Denbighshire coalfield. Coal production ceased in the area with the closure of the last remaining colliery in the area at Ifton in 1968.

It is located on the southwestern coast of San Cristóbal, the easternmost island in the archipelago, and is the capital of San Cristóbal Canton. It was founded by General Villamil Playas in the mid-19th century, and takes its name from President Alfredo Baquerizo (1859–1951). Today, fishing is the main activity of the locals, but tourism is on the increase along the waterfront with numerous hotels and shops.\n\nThe town has a cathedral, a post office, police station, a hospital, and a branch of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito. It also contains the Centro de Interpretación of the Galápagos National Park, which was established in 1988, and a natural history museum. It is served by San Cristóbal Airport, which connects to mainland Ecuador.\n\nGeneral Jose de Villamil founded the town in the 1830s or 1840s, but it takes its name from Alfredo Baquerizo (1859–1951), the first president to visit during his presidency, in 1916. The Governor of Galápagos resides in the city. The Governor's residence is a prominent grey stone edifice which also houses the Naval headquarters, and is west-northwest of the church.\n\nPuerto Baquerizo Moreno is the oldest settlement in the Galápagos Islands. The El Progreso agricultural centre, located about from the town, was established in 1879 as a Hacienda Progreso. It had a large sugar refinery which was operated under harsh conditions, and two assassinations occurred there. Other manufacturing included leather and oil products.\n\nThe Albatross Foundation USA or Fundación Ecológica Albatros is a NGO established in 1993 at the initiative of the people of the town with the objective of educating the young people of the country in the importance of preserving and conserving the island's environment and ecosystems.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the town had a population of 6,672 inhabitants, next to that of Puerto Ayora.\n\nPuerto Baquerizo Moreno is the capital and administrative centre of Ecuador's Galápagos Province. It is located on the southwestern coast of San Cristóbal, and the town is also nicknamed Cristóbal by the local people, after the island. Its average elevation is . The central part of the town, including the road to El Progreso, has paved roads. The headquarters of the navy and the national police are located in the town. It has a post office, police station and hospital. A branch campus of Universidad San Francisco de Quito is situated in the town.\n\nThere is a small beach in the town which is exclusively reserved for the sea lions that inhabit the area and are revered by the local people. There are two more beaches to the north of the town, the Playa Mann and Playa Carola, which are open to the public. The sea lions can be seen lounging on the decks of the anchored boats and have taken over park benches.\n\nThe town is situated at the foot of the Cerro San Joaquin mountain, which has an elevation of making it the highest mountain on San Cristóbal. Cerro de las Tijeretas (Frigatebird Hill) is located southeast of the town. The walk to it passes through a thickly-vegetated area consisting of aromatic \"palo santo trees\". The hill is well known for the two species of black frigatebirds, which often visit. The summit provides views of the shipping vessels in Bahía Naufragio (Shipwreck Bay). Tongo Reef is located to the west of the town. It is popular for surfing from December to February, during the warm-wet season. There is a well-protected cove known as Puerto Grande on the northwestern part of the town which has a white sandy beach where swimming is permitted. Tijeretas Cove, which is approached along a trail, is popular for snorkelling.\n\nPuerto Baquerizo Moreno has a steppe or hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: \"BSh\").\n\nDespite being an Equatorial region, the temperatures in the town and the surrounding area never reach the heights expected for such an equatorial location. Temperatures remain similar year-round, fluctuating only several degrees from January means to July means. However, two seasons predominate: the warm dry climate from January to March, and the cooler, dry season that lasts from June to November and brings continuous fog-like rain known as \"garúa\", mild to warm temperatures, and mainly overcast skies. There are also constant winds that increase the chill factor.\n\nAs San Cristóbal and other islands of the archipelago fall under the dry zone of the equatorial Pacific, they experience lesser rainfall compared to area in the northern and southern regions. On an average. The entire archipelago receives less than of rainfall per year. and the annual rainfall also varies substantially from year to year.

Annual average precipitation amounts to approximately , 86% of which falls in the five-month wet season period spanning December till May. Precipitation falls on an average of 107 days a year (precipitation ≥ 0.004\" / 0.1 mm).\n\nAll of these characteristics are because of the presence of the cold Humboldt Current that flows north from Peru and Chile. Under the effects of this current the ocean waters of the islands remain cold. The Humboldt Current is succeeded by the warm El Niño current, which is a phenomenon that is reported to influence climatic condition in the whole of South Pacific, and sometimes globally.\n\nThe mean monthly temperature is and the average monthly variation is .

As of 2014, some 520 fishermen operate from the port with 212 fishing vessels of varying sizes. Agriculture is practised marginally as there is little water on the island and the community feels that plying their boats for tourism is more economical. Drinking water supply to the town is piped from a lake near El Progreso, which also provides irrigation to lands in its vicinity. The electricity supply is continuous.\n\nTourism is now on the rise on the coast of the town, and has brought its related infrastructure such as hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops, and tourists offices.\n\nThere are several important landmarks in the town such as the Centro de Interpretación of the Galápagos National Park, the La Inmaculada cathedral, and a museum.

It was established in 1988 in the northern part of the town. It contains exhibits related to the biodiversity and anthropology of the islands. Educational presentations are interactive audio and video, which pertain to ecology and are presented in English and Spanish. The exhibits deal with the well-recorded history of the archipelago, its ecology, flora and fauna. The main hall also features rotating exhibitions, in addition to cultural events and workshops on dance and painting. There are many cacti and local flora on the land surrounding the centre, which can be viewed along the board walks. The centre also has a unique display of a rebuilt ship’s hold filled with upturned giant tortoises, which represents the way in which they were transported by pirates and whalers.\n\nThe Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno is a Roman Catholic church. at the head of bay.

Roosevelt National Historic Site\n\nThe Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site preserves the Springwood estate in Hyde Park, New York. Springwood was the birthplace, lifelong home, and burial place of the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The National Historic Site was established in 1945.\n\nIn 1697, the English Crown gave a land grant (the \"Great Nine Partners Patent\") to a group of nine businessmen from New York City. The land extended from the Hudson River on the west to the border with Connecticut on the East. To ensure equal access to the river for all partners, the land on the shore of the river was divided into nine \"Water Lots\", one of which Springwood was located on and was granted to William Creed, one of the nine partners.\n\nWhile the early history of the house on the Springwood estate remains unclear, it is believed that the central portion of the present-day house is formed by a large farmhouse that was constructed around the year 1800 in the Federal style. In 1845, the estate was purchased by Josiah Wheeler, a merchant from New York City. Wheeler undertook a remodeling of the house, giving it a then-fashionable Italianate style with a three-story tower at the south end as well as front and rear piazzas spanning the entire length of the house. After this remodeling, the house comprised a total of 15 rooms.\n\nIn 1866, the estate which had been reduced to approximately one square mile (2.5 square kilometers), was bought by James Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt's father, for US$40,000, at a time when a textile worker's earnings were less than a dollar a day. The property featured a stable and horse track, which was important to James because he took great interest in horse breeding. From the date of purchase until his death 34 years later in 1900, James made many improvements of the house and property. He enlarged the servants' wing of the building, adding two rooms, and had a spacious carriage house built in the vicinity.\n\nIn 1882, Franklin was born in what was then the second floor tower bedroom at the south end of the house. At the time, it functioned as the master bedroom; the bedroom which he, and later his sons, used during boyhood is nearby on the same floor. In 1905, after he and Eleanor Roosevelt married, the young couple moved in with his mother. The estate remained the center of Roosevelt's life in all stages of his career.\n\nIn 1915, Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with his mother Sara, undertook a final major enlargement and remodeling of the home. This was done in order to accommodate his growing family, but also to create an environment for entertaining his political associates which fitted his ambitions. Roosevelt contributed many ideas for the new design, but since the building work was paid for by his mother Sara, she had to find compromises which also took the financial aspect into account. She commissioned the design work from the firm of Hoppin & Koen, of New York City. The size of the house was more than doubled by adding two large fieldstone wings (designed by Roosevelt), a tower, and a third story with a flat roof. The clapboard exterior of the house was replaced with stucco and most of the porch was replaced with a fieldstone terrace with a balustrade and a small columned portico around the entrance. These alterations gave the exterior of the house the look of a mansion in the Colonial Revival Style. The interior, while retaining much of the layout of the old family home, was redesigned primarily with the aim of housing Roosevelt's growing collections of books, paintings, stamps, and coins. The remodeling work was finished within one year in 1916. Roosevelt also changed the appearance of the surrounding land by extensive planting of trees. Between 1911, when the large scale planting started and Roosevelt's death in 1945, more than 400,000 trees were planted on the estate. Eventually, large portions of the estate were turned into an experimental forestry station under an agreement with the Forestry Department of the Syracuse University.\n\nDuring his presidency from March 4, 1933 until his death on April 12, 1945, Franklin made almost 200 visits to Springwood, although he eventually built Top Cottage nearby as a home of his own, separate from his mother's. The main estate functioned as a \"Summer White House\" where the President hosted his political associates as well as other prominent national and international figures. In June 1939, when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King as minister in attendance, made the first visit of a reigning British monarch to the United States, they were hosted at Springwood. Other guests included Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, as well as European royalty such as Queen Wilhelmina, Princess Juliana, and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Crown Prince Olaf and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway. Further, Roosevelt used the estate as a retreat for himself and his political associates on the eves of three of the four elections in which he ran for president. When the incoming results indicated that he had won the election, he would go outside onto the front terrace to deliver his victory speech.\n\nRoosevelt made his last visit to Springwood in the last week of March 1945, about two weeks before his death. At his own wish, he was buried near the sundial in the Rose Garden on April 15, 1945. His wife was buried at his side after her death in 1962. Also buried here are Fala, the famous scottish terrier, and Chief, a German Shepherd also owned by FDR.\n\nIn 1943—two years before he died in office—Roosevelt donated the estate to the American people under the condition that his family maintained a lifetime right to usage of the property. On November 21, 1945, after the family had relinquished their rights, the estate was transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior. Since then, the estate has been administered by the National Park Service as a National Historic Site and is open to the public. In 2005, the site covered a total area of more than a square mile and received 108,611 visitors.\n\nThe walls of the entrance hall are mostly covered with pieces from Roosevelt's collection of paintings. On display are mainly naval paintings as well as some historical cartoons. Specimens from his boyhood collection of birds are also on display as well as a sculpture of him when he was 29. In the corner behind the main staircase is a manually operated trunk elevator, which the disabled president used to move between floors.\n\nThis room was the place where Roosevelt worked on his private collections; he accumulated a personal library of approximately 14,000 volumes, over 2,000 naval paintings, prints, and lithographs, over 300 bird specimens, over 200 ship models, 1.2 million stamps, as well as thousands of coins, banknotes, campaign buttons, and medallions.\n\nThe music room (also known as the \"Dresden Room\" for the origin of some of the porcelain) is a formal parlor which contains many Chinese pieces of porcelain and lacquerware. These were acquired when the family of Roosevelt's mother stayed in China, where her father made a fortune in the China trade. Together with the adjacent dining room, this part of the house was the setting for the formal entertaining of guests. A collection of autographed photographs of some of the Roosevelts' more famous guests is kept in the room on the piano.\n\nDuring the enlargement of the house in 1915, a suite of rooms was created for Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt in one of the new wings. Originally, these rooms included a sitting room and two dressing rooms, but after Roosevelt contracted a severe paralytic illness in 1921, one of the dressing rooms was converted into a separate bedroom for his wife Eleanor and the sitting room into a bedroom for his mother Sara.\n\nThis room was used by Roosevelt's mother, Sara, for beginning her day and conducting her business of running the household. The room was created in its present form during the extensive remodeling of 1915 by a division of the old South Parlor into a gallery and the Snuggery. Because most of the furniture of the old parlor was retained despite the reduction in size, the Snuggery has a cluttered appearance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It appeared in 8 books of \"The Railway Series\", by Rev. W. Awdry and Christopher Awdry, and in 99 episodes of the Television adaptation of \"The Railway Series\", \"Thomas & Friends\".\n\nIn the stories, the railway runs from the main line at Crovan's Gate to the passenger terminus at Skarloey. Beyond Skarloey the line continues to the Skarloey slate quarry. Its is run by the Thin Controller, and its chief engineer is Ivo Hugh. The line was inspired by the Talyllyn Railway in Wales, where Rev. W. Awdry worked as a volunteer guard in the 1950s. The Talyllyn railway was owned by Sir Haydn Jones (the MP for Merioneth – the county which the Talyllyn Railway is in), who inspired the character of Sir Handel Brown in the books.\n\nThe Rev. W Awdry based his stories on real incidents on the real railways. To ensure consistency and accuracy, Awdry developed a 'history' for the Island of Sodor and its railways, which was published to accompany the series. The history was set in context, and dates were determined to be consistent with the real world.\n\nIn the case of the Skarloey Railway, its history closely parallels that of the Talyllyn Railway in Wales. According to the \"research\" by the Rev. Awdry, the line began as a plateway and was opened in 1806 to collect copper ore and later slate from the local quarries. It was worked by gravity and carried mineral traffic that was shipped from Balladswail. Following the Ffestiniog Railway's lead in 1863, James Spooner was engaged in surveying a line for steam locomotives. It was also planned to develop passenger traffic for tourists to the Springs at Skarloey where there would be hotels and guest houses.\n\nIt was later realized that the line could carry visitors to the local landmarks of Skarloey (which means 'Lake in the Woods') and Rheneas ('Divided Waterfall'). Like all railways at this time, it was powered by horses, but by 1865 the railway's owners decided they needed steam engines to help out. They ordered two engines from the locomotive builders Fletcher Jennings Ltd in Whitehaven, England. These engines were Skarloey and Rheneas.\n\nSkarloey and Rheneas worked hard for many years, but eventually, the demand for slate decreased due to cheaper slate being imported from Italy. After World War II the railway was in a poor state, and the old mines had become ammunition dumps. The owner, Sir Handel Brown, thought he would have to sell the railway. At this point, the railway was taken over by Mr. Peter Sam, who became the Thin Controller. With the help of Mr. Ivo Hugh and a number of volunteers, they managed to keep the railway going. The railway's main source of income was now tourist traffic.\n\nEventually, Skarloey failed and Rheneas was left to manage alone, which he did admirably until Peter Sam and Sir Handel were bought from the Mid Sodor Railway to help out. Later they purchased Rusty and Duncan.\n\nIt was around this time that the slate quarries were reopened. The slate from these quarries was pure and free from metallic impurities, which meant it was in demand as other slate demand fell.\n\nIn 1965 (the year that \"Very Old Engines\" was published) the railway celebrated the 100th birthday of Skarloey and Rheneas with the opening of a new branch line to Lakeside by the Duke of Sodor. A second triumph came in 1969 when Duke was saved and brought to the railway, where he was repaired and now works the passenger trains.\n\nSince the centenary celebrations of 1965, the railway has purchased a new diesel, \"Fred\". It has also built a new steam engine, \"Ivo Hugh\", who was built in \"New Little Engine\".\nIn The Railway Stories books, all of the steam engines are painted the same bright red colour with a simple blue lining except for Duke (who retained the paint from his days on the Mid Sodor Railway) and Rusty, who is painted charcoal-black. Unusually, the engines did not have nameplates; their names were just painted directly in gold on the side of the saddle tanks or boiler, as to had been the case on the Talyllyn Railway before the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society took over. The other diesels are painted dark-grey. The steam locomotive livery features lots of polished brass-work and is largely unchanged since the opening of the railway (judging by the illustrations in \"Very Old Engines\", although these show a more elaborate blue and yellow lining scheme).\nIn the Thomas & Friends TV series, all of the engines, apart from Duke, are painted in completely different colours. This was presumably to assist the show's young fans in identifying the different engines. In the TV series, Skarloey is painted bright red (as in the books) with white and gold lining (blue in the books); Rheneas was painted vermilion; Sir Handel and Peter Sam retained the colors that they wore when they were named Falcon and Stuart, on the Mid Sodor Railway (blue and green respectively); Rusty was painted orange (which was the reason for his naming, according to a Thomas the Tank Engine annual); Duncan was painted yellow with gold and black lining; and Duke kept his [[Mid- Railway Series brown..\n\nAgnes, Ruth, Lucy, Jemima and Beatrice are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 1–5. The brake van Cora is based on the [[Corris Railway]] brake van that now runs on the Talyllyn.\nOpen coaches Ada, Jane and Mabel were rebuilt to a more conventional outline when funds became available and are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 11, 12, 13. Gertrude and Millicent, bogie coaches, are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 9 & 10. There are also longer coaches which are supposedly Talyllyn Railway carriages 16 and 18–23.\n\nIn [[The Railway Stories]] books, the open carriages and guard's vans are painted blue (very similar to the British Rail [[rail blue]]). The enclosed carriages are painted off-white (upper half) and blue (lower).\n\nThere have been a number of people associated with the railway who have appeared in the stories and TV Series.\n\nKnown properly as Mr. Peter Sam, the Thin Controller is the manager of the Skarloey Railway. A year before the arrival of Sir Handel and Peter Sam, he had to serve as [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard|guard]] for all the trains.\n\nThe Thin Controller was introduced in \"[[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]\", the tenth volume of [[the Railway Series]] and has now been introduced into the \"[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]\" TV series as [[Mr. Percival]], the narrow-gauge controller. He is based upon Edward Thomas general manager of the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nAccording to \"[[List of Railway Series Books#Sodor: Reading Between the Lines|Sodor: Reading Between the Lines]]\", there are two thin controllers.\n\n\nFormer owner of the railway, there have been two Sir Handel Browns:\n\nIvo Hugh was one half of the two-man train crew in the final days of two-engine operation, alongside The Thin Controller. He was also the line's Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) and became \"Rusty's\" driver, upon the diesel locomotive's arrival.\n\nHugh had retired by the time of \"[[List of Railway Series Books#New Little Engine|New Little Engine]]\" and had the honour of having the railway's new No. 7 named after him.\n\nHis son succeeded him as the new CME.\n\n\nThe names of the stations are not actually ever mentioned in the books (with the exception of one halt, Quarry Siding), and were referred to as \"the station by the lake\", \"the main station\", \"the first station\", \"the middle station\", \"the station by the waterfalls\", \"the top station\", etc.; thus, all their names are derived from [[List of Railway Series books#Companion_volumes|complementary publications about Sodor]], such as \"[[List of Railway Series Books#The Thomas the Tank Engine Man|The Thomas the Tank Engine Man]]\".\n\nThe railway runs from Crovan's Gate, to Cros-ny-Cuirn, then stopping at Glennock, calling at Rheneas before starting the Lakeside loop line, which stops at Lakeside and finally the line ended at Skarloey.\n\nAnother line branches off near Lakeside and goes to Ulfstead Castle.\n\nA further halt, called 'Quarry Siding' is mentioned in \"[[List of Railway Series books#The Little Old Engine|The Little Old Engine]]\". This halt is based on [[Quarry Siding Halt railway station|Quarry Siding halt]] on the Talyllyn Railway.\n\nThis is the main station and southern terminus of the railway. The station complex is a compilation of all the stations at [[Tywyn]], which is the primary location and western terminus of the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nThe passenger station at Crovan's Gate has a very typical layout for an interchange station. It has no specific real-life base, but could have been inspired by a proposed interchange station at [[Tywyn railway station|Tywyn mainline station]], which was the planned passenger terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, however the railway between [[Tywyn Wharf railway station|Tywyn Wharf Station]] and the mainline station was never built – for unknown reasons.\n\nThe workshops, locomotive sheds, and carriage shed, at Crovan's Gate, portrayed in all of the books involving the Skarloey Railway, are based on the workshops, locomotive sheds, and original carriage shed, at on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nThe wharf at Crovans Gate, as portrayed in \"[[List of Railway Series books#The_Little_Old_Engine|The Little Old Engine]]\" and \"[[List of Railway Series books#Gallant_Old_Engine|Gallant Old Engine]]\", is based on the slate wharf at on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nCros-ny-Curin Station is a minor station about 3 miles away from Crovan's Gate. It is situated at the point where the Skarloey Railway's current route starts deviating from the route of the 1806 horse-drawn plateway, and is were the first incline was on the plateway.\n\nThe station, as portrayed in \"[[List of Railway Series books#Four_Little_Engines|Four Little Engines]]\", is based on [[Rhyd-yr-onen railway station|Rhyd-yr-onen station]] on the Talyllyn Railway.\n\nCros-ny-Curin's (fictional) etymology is that it was derived from 'Crossag-ny-cuirn', which means 'Little-Crossing-of-the-Mountain-Ash' in [[Sudric]] (Sodor's fictional language). This is a reflection of the meaning of 'Rhyd-yr-onnen' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which is 'Ash-ford'.\n\nGlennock Station, often called 'the middle station', is a station approximately 11 miles from Crovan's Gate.\n\nThe station's name is (fictionally) derived from 'Gleigh-knock', which means 'Blue-hill' in Sudric. This is the same as the Welsh meaning of [[Brynglas railway station|Bryn-Glas station]] on the Talyllyn Railway, which the station was partly based on.\n\nGlennock station's positioning is based on Brynglas station on the Talyllyn Railway, but the station itself, as portrayed in \"[[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]\", is based on [[Aberllefenni railway station|Aberllefenni station]] on the [[Corris Railway]].\n\nRheneas, often called 'The station by the waterfalls', is a station built for tourists traffic to the nearby waterfalls. It is approximately 21 miles away from Crovan's Gate.\n\nRheneas station, as portrayed in \"[[List of Railway Series Books#Gallant Old Engine|Gallant Old Engine]]\", is based on [[Dolgoch railway station|Dolgoch station]] on the Talyllyn Railway. 'Rheneas' means 'Divided Waterfall' in Sudric, and the station is so-named because of the nearby waterfalls, which themselves are based on the waterfalls near Dolgoch station on the Talyllyn Railway.\n\nLakeside station is a station which is halfway round the \"Lakeside Loop\". It is approximately 23 miles away from Crovan's Gate.\n\nThe station, and the associated \"Lakeside Loop Line\" which the station is on, was opened in \"[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]\", by the [[Duke of Sodor]]\n\nSkarloey station is the northern passenger terminus of the Skarloey Railway, although the railway continues to quarries further west. The station was built for tourists for the lake, and is approximately 22 miles from Crovan's Gate.\n\nThe location of Skarloey station is based on a proposed station serving the hamlet of Dolffanog, a small hamlet north-east of [[Tal-y-llyn lake|Talyllyn lake]], which featured in various 1970s proposals for an extension of the Talyllyn Railway to [[Tal-y-llyn Lake|Talyllyn lake]], [[Corris]], and [[Machynlleth]]. However, most of the station layout itself, as portrayed in \"[[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]\", is based on [[Abergynolwyn railway station]], the eastern terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, in its pre-1976 layout.\n\nSkarloey's (fictional) eytymology is that the word came from 'Scacaloey', which itself was a corruption of 'Skogarloey', which means 'Lake-in-the-Woods' in Sudric. This is based on the meaning of 'Talyllyn' (Head-of-the-lake) in Welsh.\n\nThe railway in the television series also calls at Middle, Elephant Park, Tea Room, Bluebell Valley, Mountain Village, and Rumblin Bridge.\n\nIn the television series the railway runs from The Wharf, to west to Crovan's Gate, then north south of Rheneas where a line branches off and goes to Vicarstown, The main line continues the same path it does in the Railway Series.\n\nThe Skarloey Railway first appeared in [[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]], the 10th book in [[The Railway Series]], in October 1955. It has also featured in every season of the [[Thomas and Friends]] TV Show since [[Thomas & Friends (series 4)|season 4]]\n\nThe railway appeared in six books in [[The Railway Series]] – four in which it was the primary railway, and two in which it was not the primary focus, but played a significant supporting role.\nThe railway first appeared in [[Thomas and Friends - Season 4|the fourth season]] of [[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]]. At this time it closely followed the layout as portrayed in [[The Railway Series]] books, but from [[Thomas and Friends - Season 5|Season 5]] it differed significantly, deviating further from the books at the same time as the route of the [[North Western Railway (fictional)|North Western Railway]] was significantly altered.\n\nIt appears to be part of the North Western Railway rather than an independent line. It was run by [[the Fat Controller]], but from the ninth season onwards was under the control of \"Mr Percival\", a man strongly resembling the Thin Controller (as he is often referred to in the British version. Similarly, the American version occasionally refers to him as the Narrow Gauge Controller). Mr Hugh does not appear at all.\n\nThe railway has many more carriages in this version. Ada, Jane, Mabel, Gertrude and Millicent are entirely absent. Coaches resembling Agnes, Ruth, Lucy, Jemima, Beatrice and Cora do appear along with red coaches and coaches which are green upper half and cream lower half, but are unnamed and rarely speak. Ivo Hugh (the engine) has not appeared either, as the book in which he appeared (\"New Little Engine\") has not been televised. However, the line has four new engines in this version named Bertram, Mighty Mac, \"Fearless\" Freddie, who acquired the number of Ivo Hugh, and Luke. Proteus was another engine originated from the TV series. He was never seen with the other engines, but Peter Sam once tried to find him and his magic lamp. He never succeeded. Years later, Peter Sam discovered a statue of Proteus that was put on display at the Showgrounds.\n\nThe Owner also does not appear.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Railways of Sodor]]\n\n\n[[Category:Railways of Sodor]]"}

{"id": "1949922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949922", "title": "Frutillar", "text": "Frutillar\n\nFrutillar is a city and commune located in southern Chile, Chilean Patagonia within the Los Lagos Region. The bay of Frutillar is placed on the banks of Lake Llanquihue, the largest lake entirely within Chile. Frutillar is known as the \"City of Music\".\n\nAfter a period of clearing up the land, the city of Frutillar was founded by German settlers in 1856, among them Christian Winkler, Wilhelm Kaschel, Heinrich Kuschel, Theodor Niklitshek, Christian Nannig and Adams Schmidt.\n\nVicente Perez Rosales on a later expedition towards the south of Valdivia changed the course of the incoming colony to Lake Llanquihue. Rosales was searching for more land for the German settlers, south of Valdivia, as many sailing ships were arriving to the port of Valdivia from Germany sent by Bernardo Philippi under the official colonisation program of Southern Chile. This program was granted by President Manuel Bulnes and executed by president of Chile Manuel Montt naming officially Vicente Perez Rosales the head of the German colonisation of Llanquihue, as a continuation of the initial efforts done by Bernard Philippi. \n\nRosales, reached the lake through the dense wild forest and climbed to Osorno Volcano and at the height of 2,000 meters he was able to see the ocean to the south where he saw sailing ships navigating. It was the chilotes from Chiloe that had been sailing in the inner waters of Puerto Montt since 1550 and came mainly from Galicia Spain, which has very similar climate conditions. He immediately informed this issue to the port of Valdivia and thus, from there on, the settlers started their incoming through Puerto Montt and travelled by land to Puerto Varas where other ships would sail the shores of lake Llanquihue to Frutillar and Puerto Octay. \n\nA quote of the time illustrates the discovery of lake Llanquihue during its first sighting by Philippi \"The water of this lake is as clear as that of Geneva in Switzerland, its surface is about seven leagues long and one league wide, so I could not distinguish the opposite bank. On one hand, it has the snowy Alps, the Andes Mountain that rises from its eastern banks of a volcano covered with snow up to half of its height and goes into its waters.\" Bernardo Philippi 1842 This illustrates the period when Philippi discovers Lake Llanquihue and its similarity with Lake Geneva in Switzerland. This information was given to the German settler in order to describe them the beauty of the region. It took over 10 years to be able to bring all the settlers from Germany to Chile and establish the first colonisation program in Lake Llanquihue.\n\nAlthough Bernhard Eunom Philippi did its discovery in 1842, when he was exploring the region with the Chilean army, he brought the idea to the Chilean government that the Southern Region of Chile would be best developed by bringing German Settlers that were having a hard time in Germany with the industrial revolution and had plans to migrate to America. This opportunity to attract German families to immigrate to Chile had to be done. The combined effort of Bernhard Eunom Philippi with Vicente Perez Rosales, made the colonisation a reality and proved to be a success, as the region later was very well developed in agricultural and forestry, with European technology. Also German schools proved to be the best in the Southern region of Chile.\n\nThe German Museum, Teatro del Lago, Cofradia Nautica de Frutillar and Patagonia Virgin are today's main attractions in Frutillar.\n\nThe German Museum: The museum opens daily and it is located in the centre of the bay of Frutillar, one of the most beautiful touristic villages of Lake Llanquihue. The German Colony that arrived to the city in 1856 built their houses, water mill, warehouse and gardens to live there; the descendants of these settlers decided to leave these buildings for a museum that shows the way they lived. It is composed of a garden, the machine warehouse, the water mill to grind the seeds, and the main house that is located uphill with a great view to the Lake.\n\nTeatro del Lago: Offers concerts all year round and is located in the main coastal road of the bay. The theatre is considered the largest in the country and the best acoustic theatre ever built in South America. Every year the musical festival traditionally conducts a continuous 2 week concert, called Musical Festival or “Semanas Musicales” this takes place at the end of January and the first week of February in the theatre. This cultural activity brings thousand of visitors every year. \nCofradia Nautica de Frutillar - Yacht Club: Is the lake's largest and best equipped yacht club located in the bay 400 m south of Teatro del Lago, along the coastal road of Frutillar Bay. The Club has activity all year; and promotes sailing in all categories. The yacht Club was established in 1986. There are 3 sailing schools in the bay that have been founded and promoted by “Cofradia”, also during the spring and summer the yacht club makes Regattas on the Bay and around the lake. \n\nPatagonia Virgin: Is a new urban development that will have hotels, commerce, restaurants, golf course Nicklaus, apartments and houses, as well as trekking, polo and tennis. The village, which is at the foot of Patagonia Virgin, will have over 40 stores, shops and restaurants with wild forest and views to all four volcanoes accessing lake Llanquihue through the Frutillar Bay. It is located 200 m south of Cofradia yacht club.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Frutillar spans an area of and has 15,525 inhabitants (7,948 men and 7,577 women). Of these, 9,118 (58.7%) lived in urban areas and 6,407 (41.3%) in rural areas. The population grew by 18.4% (2,418 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\n\nAs a commune, Frutillar is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2016-2020 alcalde is Claus Lindemann, independent.\n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Frutillar is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Fidel Espinoza (PS) and Carlos Recondo (UDI) as part of the 56th electoral district, (together with Puyehue, Río Negro, Purranque, Puerto Octay, Fresia, Llanquihue, Puerto Varas and Los Muermos). The commune is represented in the Senate by Camilo Escalona Medina (PS) and Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).\n\nPreviously the area had a German school, Instituto Aleman Frutillar.\n\nMost common surnames and their frequencies in Frutillar as of 2014:\n\n"}
{"id": "1949928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949928", "title": "The Sodor &amp; Mainland Railway", "text": "The Sodor &amp; Mainland Railway\n\nThe Sodor & Mainland Railway (1853–1914) was a fictional railway that existed on the Island of Sodor in The Railway Series books written by the Rev. W. Awdry. In the books it is known as the S&M and was built when railway-mania was still in force, opening in 1853. The initial aim of the railway was to link Sodor with the British Mainland.\n\nThe Sodor & Mainland Railway ran from the docks at Kirk Ronan to the town of Ballahoo via Rolf's Castle and Crovan's Gate, but never actually reached the mainland due to lack of money and misfortunes.\n\nThe plan to extend to the Mainland via Vicarstown failed when the tunnel under construction through the Ballahoo Ridge collapsed and plans to build a bridge across the Walney Channel was halted by the Admiralty (who ironically in World War I became the driving force behind the unification of Sodor's railways and completion of the same link to the mainland that they hindered the S&M in building).\n\nThe S&M did, at one time, plan to build a western extension into Sodor's mountain country to connect the expanding industrial town of Peel Godred to the railway network. This plan, like the others, came to nothing and Peel Godred's first railway was the narrow gauge Mid Sodor Railway line, and then later still the NWR's electric Peel Godred Branch, which was built under the powers granted to the S&M to extend to Peel Godred by Parliament in 1853.\n\nMany of the S&M staff originally came from Ireland or Scotland. It provided passenger services, but was primarily intended to be a goods line. Although plans were put in action to start a steamer ferry service from Kirk Ronan to Dublin, nothing much came of it.\n\nThe Sodor & Mainland Railway's finances collapsed in 1910 and finally the company amalgamated with other small railways on the island under military pressure in 1914, to form the North Western Railway (NWR), now under the direction of its CMD (Chief Managing Director), Sir Topham Hatt, better known as The Fat Controller.\n\nThe S&M's dreams of a link between Sodor and the Mainland did eventually come to pass under the reign of Sir Topham Hatt, who constructed a rail bridge across the Walney Channel.\n\nOnly a small length of the operational S&M became part of the NWR mainline: namely the section between Kellsthorpe Road and a point just east of Crovan's Gate. Ballahoo was bypassed by the main line but the S&M's line is still used as a secondary route connecting the town with the rest of Sodor and the mainland, along with the later-built Norramby Branch.\n\nFurther north the NWR main-line rejoins the Norramby Branch and with it the S&M's proposed route to Vicarstown. This section includes the S&M's unfinished tunnel under the Ballahoo Ridge, though the collapse which stopped progress now means two tunnels exist separated by a cutting.\n\nIt is stated in the Railway Series that the Sodor & Mainland Railway had three engines, only one of which (\"Neil\") appeared in the books. It is unknown what other engines worked for the railway, but all three engines that were mentioned had been scrapped by the time the railway became defunct due to them being too small and weak for modern day workloads. However, it is widely believed that Neil is now stored as the centrepiece in the Sudrian Museum.\n\nAccording to The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways, the Sodor and Mainland Railway owned three 0-4-0T engines - one of which was Neil - with open cabs and square tanks that operated on the Sodor and Mainland Railway from 1856 until the line went bankrupt. They were typical contractors' engines of the period and due to the S&MR's casual attitude to record keeping, details of their acquisition and lives have sadly been lost. It is unknown if they were named. \n\nThe last locomotive was scrapped in 1901 which brought services to a close\n\nNeil was built at Neilson and Company's Hyde Park Works in Glasgow, Scotland around 1856, for the Sodor and Mainland Railway and was a typical contractors' engine of the period. In 1865, he helped to ferry Skarloey from the port of Kirk Ronan to his home at the Skarloey Railway terminus of Crovan's Gate. He warned Skarloey about trucks and the two became friends.\n\nVery little is known about Neil due to the S&M's casual attitude to record keeping, but it is assumed he was scrapped by 1901, bringing services to an end.\n\nIn Christopher Awdry's book \"\", he states that Neil's class is unknown. However, Neil strongly resembles a Neilson \"box tank\". This was a simple and robust class of engine built in Glasgow and sold all over the world. This would explain both his name and his Scottish accent.\n\nThe steam engines were painted dark green with the letters 'S & M' painted on the side of tanks in yellow with red shading.\n\nThe carriage stocks were painted tan with black lining.\n\nDespite having never appeared in the Thomas & Friends television series, Neil has nevertheless been included in commercial merchandising lines based on the series.\n\n"}

The southern terminus of this four-lane divided highway is at a trumpet interchange with U.S. Route 20/US 23 (US 20/US 23) approximately northeast of the village of Luckey. The route’s northern terminus is at the southern terminus of Interstate 280 (I-280), where the two routes meet the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) at a double-trumpet interchange nearly southwest of Millbury. SR 420 made its debut in the late 1960s. It is a major route whose primary purpose is to link US 20/US 23 with I-280 and the Ohio Turnpike.\n\nFor its entire length, SR 420 is a four-lane divided highway, with access provided only at three intersections along the way, and two interchanges, one at either end of the highway. There is no driveway access at any point along SR 420.\n\nLocated entirely in the northeastern portion of Wood County, SR 420 begins at a trumpet interchange with the US 20/US 23 in Troy Township and heads due north from that point. The first portion of the highway is abutted by a neighborhood of mobile homes on the west side, and a blend of woods and open field on the east side. After intersecting Truman Road, SR 420 has farmland meeting it on both sides. It then meets SR 163 and crosses into Lake Township. Continuing north, SR 420 soon passes into the midst of multiple truck stops as in approaches the Ohio Turnpike. The highway connects to these truck stops via a signalized intersection with Libbey Road. Immediately north of this intersection, SR 420 comes to an end as it arrives at the double-trumpet interchange that connects the route with the Ohio Turnpike, I-80/I-90. As SR 420 terminates, I-280 begins its northerly trek to Toledo and points north.\n\nConsequential to its function as a major connector route, the entire length of SR 420 is included within the National Highway System.\n\nThe SR 420 designation was established in 1969. It was applied to what was formerly a portion of SR 120 prior to its eastern terminus being moved back to Toledo. SR 120 had formerly overlapped I-280, and then continued solo south of the Ohio Turnpike before ending at US 20/US 23.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, a new trumpet interchange was completed to facilitate the movement of traffic through the southern terminus of SR 420 where it meets the US 20/US 23 duplex.\n\n"}

It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.\n\nEvery year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.\n\nTo perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:\n\nThe distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets.

Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.\n\nIn August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.\n\nThis branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of pre-Hispanic codices. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.\n\n"}

{"id": "1949947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949947", "title": "OpenNTPD", "text": "OpenNTPD\n\nOpenNTPD (also known as OpenBSD NTP Daemon) is a Unix daemon implementing the Network Time Protocol to synchronize the local clock of a computer system with remote NTP servers. It is also able to act as an NTP server to NTP-compatible clients.\n\nOpenNTPD is primarily developed by Henning Brauer as part of the OpenBSD project. Its design goals include being secure (non-exploitable), easy to configure, and accurate enough for most purposes. Its portable version, like that of OpenSSH, is developed as a child project which adds the portability code to the OpenBSD version and releases it separately. The portable version is developed by Brent Cook. . The project developers receive some funding from the OpenBSD Foundation.\n\nThe development of OpenNTPD was motivated by a combination of issues with current NTP daemons: difficult configuration, complicated and difficult to audit code, and unsuitable licensing. OpenNTPD was designed to solve these problems and make time synchronization accessible to a wider userbase. After a period of development, OpenNTPD first appeared in OpenBSD 3.6. Its first release was announced on 2 November 2004.\n\nOpenNTPD is an attempt by the OpenBSD team to produce an NTP daemon implementation that is secure, simple to audit, trivial to set up and administer, reasonably accurate, and light on system resources. As such, the design goals for OpenNTPD are: security, ease of use, and performance. Security in OpenNTPD is achieved by robust validity check in the network input path, use of bounded buffer operations via strlcpy, and privilege separation to mitigate the effects of possible security bugs exploiting the daemon through privilege escalation. In order to simplify the use of NTP, OpenNTPD implements a smaller set of functionalities than those available in other NTP daemons, such as that provided by the Network Time Protocol Project. The objective is to provide enough features to satisfy typical usage at the risk of unsuitability for esoteric or niche requirements. OpenNTPD is configured through the configuration file, \"ntpd.conf\". A minimal number of options are offered: IP address or hostname on which OpenNTPD should listen, a timedelta sensor device to be used, and the set of servers from which the time will be synchronized. The accuracy of OpenNTPD is best-effort; the daemon attempts to be as accurate as possible but no specific accuracy is guaranteed.\n\nOpenNTPD gradually adjusts the system clock, as seen here in the output of OpenNTPD running on a Linux system:\nOpenNTPD has been criticized as being less accurate than the NTP daemon produced by the NTP Project (ntp.org). Internally, OpenNTPD does not maintain millisecond accuracy and can vary 50-200ms from \"real\" time because it omits a variety of algorithms that increase accuracy in favour of code simplicity. The OpenNTPD project acknowledged the criticism, but stated that the lack of microsecond precision was a design tradeoff that benefited simplicity and security. The OpenNTPD design goals state the project's intent is to \"[r]each a reasonable accuracy\" without sacrificing \"secure design for getting that last nanosecond or obscure edge case.\"\n\nIn September 2004, shortly after the release of OpenNTPD 3.6, ntp.org contributor Brad Knowles published an article entitled \"OpenNTPd Considered Harmful\" criticizing various aspects of OpenNTPD's implementation of the NTP protocol, as well as the split development model that the project employs, which is also used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBGPD. In December 2004, Darren Tucker, the principal developer on the portable branch of OpenNTPD, wrote a detailed response to Knowles, acknowledging some issues as valid, rejecting several others as unwarranted, and considering yet others as misleading. Among the more serious issues raised by Knowles was that OpenNTPD servers claimed to be stratum 1 servers. The issue had however already been fixed by the time of Tucker's response. In March 2005, Knowles acknowledged Tucker's response, and stated that he was \"going to do everything [he could] to work with [Tucker] to get any remaining issues resolved\". Additionally, the OpenBSD networking FAQ was expanded with a response to Knowles' initial criticism.\n\nOpenNTPD (and the OpenBSD kernel) ignore leap seconds. Care should be taken when using OpenNTPD as a higher-stratum source for other ntpd servers, or with high-resolution time requirements that reference Coordinated Universal Time. Leap seconds are used in Coordinated Universal Time, but not International Atomic Time or Global Positioning System time signals.\n\nThe United States Naval Observatory and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures recommends that systems not implementing leap seconds be referenced to International Atomic Time, or directly to GPS time signals.\n\n"}

He was elected as a councillor in 1977, and served on the St. John's City Council until he resigned as Mayor in 2008. Wells ran for Mayor in the 2017 municipal election, but was unsuccessful.\n\nHe was first elected as the city's mayor in 1997, and was re-elected in 2001 and 2005.\n\nWells attracted considerable media attention in Newfoundland and Labrador and other parts of Canada due to his gruff, outspoken personality. He appeared on the Rick Mercer Report as a nominee for \"Craziest Mayor in Canada.\" He is noted for many scandals such as various insults to other council members.\n\nIn 1998, Wells flew the Tibetan flag as a protest of the Chinese occupation of Tibet during a visit by a Chinese delegation.\n\nWells has also been an object of controversy regarding neighbouring communities. He is famous for wanting to amalgamate its sister city, Mount Pearl. His most notable saying is \"bring it on, I have never backed down from a good fight\".\n\nIn 2008, Wells was appointed chair and chief executive officer of the provincial public utilities board, which oversees power, water, waste, etc., for towns and cities. Controversy arose soon after when Wells refused to resign his position as mayor, citing reasons such as higher costs for a by-election or a lack of legislation against it. Many believed a conflict-of-interest would result, and that Wells would not be objective in his decisions. Most of the controversy was settled, however, when on February 12, Premier Danny Williams released a statement saying that while he still believed Wells could perform both tasks, he would be delaying Wells' appointment until after he resigned as mayor.\n\nOn February 19, 2008, Wells announced that he would step down from the mayoral position on March 3. Wells was attempting to delay his departure long enough so the city of St. John's would not have to run a by-election that Wells claimed would cost the city $400,000.\n\nOn March 3, 2008, Wells became head of the Public Utilities Board. He was suspended from this position in 2017 as a result of criticisms against the St. John's City Council sent from his government email. The investigation into his conduct was dropped soon after when Wells resigned to run for mayor again in the 2017 municipal election.\n\nWells announced in August 2017, that he would run for Mayor of St. John's again in the 2017 municipal election. His announcement came after weeks of criticizing St. John's City Council, specifically then-Mayor Dennis O'Keefe and councillors Danny Breen and Jonathan Galgay. He lost the mayoral election to Breen, winning 33.09 per cent of the vote to Breen's 53.19 per cent.\n"}
{"id": "1949968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949968", "title": "Sprint football", "text": "Sprint football\n\nSprint football, formerly called lightweight football, is a varsity sport played by United States colleges and universities, under standard American football rules. The sport is currently governed by the Collegiate Sprint Football League.\n\nIn sprint football, players must maintain a weight of 178 lb (81 kg) or less and a minimum of 5% body fat to be eligible to play. The end result of these weight restrictions is that, unlike conventional collegiate football which places a premium on body weight and strength, sprint football emphasizes speed and agility.\n\nAs of 2019, 10 schools field teams in the CSFL; of the 10, seven are private universities (two being schools in the Ivy League, and one being a for-profit institution) and two are national military academies; Mansfield University of Pennsylvania is the only state university or college currently playing sprint football. All of the teams are located in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. Seven schools have joined in the 21st century, one in 2008 and the others in the 2010s; six remain active in sprint football today. Of these new members, only Franklin Pierce University, which joined in 2012, no longer sponsors the sport, having transitioned to full-sized football in NCAA Division II after the 2018 season. Of the 21st-century arrivals, only Alderson Broaddus University, also a Division II member, has a full-size varsity football team. The other four teams (all of which have been in the CSFL since 1957) have full-size football teams that compete in NCAA Division I—the service academies in FBS, and the Ivy League schools in FCS. Each team plays a seven-game season. It is not uncommon for the CSFL teams to play against full-size junior varsity or club football squads from other schools in the early part of the season (in 2015, for instance, Navy faced the Longwood Lancers). In addition, Army, Cornell, Princeton, and Penn all hold alumni games in which sprint football alumni return to campus for a full-contact scrimmage against the varsity squad. The alumni games serve the dual purpose of raising funds to support the team and maintaining alumni interest in the program. Typically, the alumni have to donate a monetary weight penalty (e.g., $2 per pound) for weighing above the 178-pound limit. In 2017, when Caldwell joined, the CSFL was split into two divisions, the North and the South. On December 7, 2017, St. Thomas Aquinas College was announced as the tenth team in the league, to begin play in the 2018 season. After that season, Franklin Pierce left to play full-sized football and was replaced by Alderson Broaddus.\n\nAs of 2019, only one charter member of the league remains, the Penn Quakers. The Princeton Tigers dropped the sport after 2015, following sixteen consecutive years of winless seasons (an organized football record) and changes in league membership, and shifted its resources to club football. A number of other Ivy League schools have historically had sprint football teams, including the Yale Bulldogs, Harvard Crimson, and Columbia Lions, all of whom had dropped the sport many years earlier; of the Ivy League schools, only Penn and the Cornell Big Red remain.\n\nFor its first 83 seasons, the CSFL did not sponsor playoff or bowl games (a tradition due in no small part to the Ivy League schools, who, like the rest of the Ivy League, abstain from all football postseason play to encourage academic performance). The season championship was decided solely by the regular season record; if multiple teams were tied atop the standings, all of them shared the championship. Since Navy's and Army's respective admissions to the league, those two schools have dominated the league; of the 72 seasons of lightweight football since Navy joined, they and/or Army have won at least a share of the league title in 64 of them, including stretches of 20 consecutive seasons from 1955–74 and 17 straight from 1983–99. Since the 2017 season, a championship game has been held on Veterans Day weekend.\n\nAlthough CSFL teams are considered varsity teams and official school-sponsored sports for the purpose of the NCAA, sprint football teams do not fall into the same divisional structure as other NCAA sports.\n\nIn April 2020, the CSFL chose Dan Mara, also Commissioner of the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC) as Commissioner.\n\nCSFL rules require that players must weigh no more than , a figure that has slowly increased from its original as the weight of the American college student has increased over the course of the league's existence. League rules specify official weigh-ins four days and two days before each game. Players are allowed to weigh-in up to 183 pounds (82.6 kg) four days before game but in order to be eligible to play they must weigh-in under 178 pounds (81 kg) on the two day weigh-ins. Players are allowed to gain weight back after meeting the weight limit\n\n\n\n"}

Located on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island, it is the seat of Santa Cruz Canton. The town is named in honor of Isidro Ayora, an Ecuadorian president. The town is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Santa Cruz. Puerto Ayora is the most populous town in the Galápagos Islands, with more than 12,000 inhabitants. \n\nPuerto Ayora has a protected location, along the shores of Academy Bay, where a refreshing breeze often provides pleasant weather. Temperatures vary between 18 and 29 °C (64 and 82 °F). The hot season usually runs from December to May.\n\nPuerto Ayora has the best developed infrastructure in the archipelago. The larger of the two Galápagos banks, Banco del Pacifico, is located in Puerto Ayora. The walkable downtown area of Puerto Ayora is a small strip of hotels, restaurants, tour companies, gift shops, hotels, restaurants, clothing stores, marine stores, tourist shops and night clubs. The main Avenue is named Avenida Charles Darwin and begins on the main dock of Puerto Ayora and finishes at the Charles Darwin Research Station. The Town Hall (\"Alcaldía\") is on Avenida Charles Darwin as well. Puerto Ayora is the best place in Galápagos for communicating with the outside world via numerous cybercafes with Internet access or telephone offices. \n\nPuerto Ayora emergency medical facilities include a new hospital opened in 2006 and the island's only hyperbaric chamber. There is a Health Center (\"Centro de Salud\") in the northern part of Puerto Ayora as well.\n\nMost of the locals live in the northern part of the town were various schools, a market hall and a sports center where built. Most of the shops, hardware stores and grocery stores there can be found in Calle Baltra and Calle Durán. The stadium is in the northwest of the center close to the bus station.\nFresh water is at a premium on the island and in this town. Locals practice water conservation and typically collect rainwater during the rainy season. There is a desalination plant on the island. Many facilities have separate water systems with varying degrees of use/quality. For example, water used for cleaning/showering may not be drinkable.\n\nHome to both the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galápagos National Park, Puerto Ayora is the center of the Galápagos conservation efforts. Island visitors may visit the Charles Darwin Research Station to learn the history of the islands and future conservation plans.\n\"Iglesia de San Francisco\" is a modern church which was built in 1968. \"Iglesia de Edén\" and \"Iglesia de la Calle E\" are modern churches in the northern part of Puerto Ayora with colourful wall paintings which are worth a visit as well.\n\nTortuga Bay is a short walk from center of Puerto Ayora where you can view marine iguanas, birds, galapagos crabs and a natural mangrove where you can spot white tip reef sharks and the gigantic galápagos tortoise.\n\nThe Itabaca Channel is located between two islands in the Galápagos, Baltra Island, also known as South Seymour Island, and Santa Cruz Island. The Itabaca Channel is used by water taxis who take people from Baltra to Santa Cruz.\n\nAcademy Bay is a busy harbor, normally full of boats cruising the islands, passing private yachts and local fishing boats. This bay is a good location to spot brown pelicans, golden rays, marine iguanas, herons, lava gulls, frigate birds, Galápagos sea lions, and large numbers of blue-footed boobies, which fish by spectacular plunge diving. North Seymour Island is an hour away by boat and has a wide array of animals with no people living on the island.\n\nFlights from continental Ecuador fly into either San Cristobal or to Baltra Island just off the north end of Santa Cruz. Those airlines are AeroGal and LAN Ecuador. The typical means to reach Puerto Ayora from the Baltra airport is a bus ride to the Itabaca Channel where a ferry ride is taken to Santa Cruz Island. Then another bus, courtesy vehicle or taxi is taken to Puerto Ayora. From the Puerto Ayora docks water taxis wait to take passengers to their boats or to west Puerto Ayora. The municipal bus station (\"Terminal\") is in the northwest of the town.\n\nThere are also daily speed boats which take passengers to or from Puerto Ayora and the other inhabited islands of San Cristóbal or Isabela.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Entercom and broadcasts a sports radio format. The WIP-FM offices and studios are located on the 9th floor of 400 Market Street in Philadelphia, and the broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at ().\n\nWIP-FM is the flagship station for the Philadelphia Eagles Football Network and the MLB Philadelphia Phillies Radio Network. The station has local hosts days and evenings, with programming from CBS Sports Radio heard overnight.\n\nWIP-FM broadcasts using HD Radio. Its HD2 subchannel is a simulcast of co-owned 1060 KYW's all-news format. The HD3 channel carries a classic rock format that had been once heard on 94.1 when it was WYSP. The HD4 channel is known as \"Eagles 24/7,\" with continuous programming about the football team.\n\nIn 1948, the station signed on as WIBG-FM. It was the sister station of WIBG, and mostly simulcast the AM station, including the 1960s when WIBG was one of Philadelphia's leading Top 40 stations. However, it was hard to hear the FM station outside of Philadelphia and its close suburbs, because it was only powered at 10,000 watts on a 180 foot tower, well below the standard for other Philadelphia FM stations. In the mid-1960s, WIBG-FM began to experiment at night with a prerecorded progressive rock format without announcers. \n\nIn 1968, owner Storer Broadcasting shut the station down while attempting to get Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permission for an increase in power. WIBG-FM was a restricted Class B station at the time. It was limited in range to avoid interfering with WKOK-FM in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, also on 94.1 MHz, 106 miles away (see Signal Note below). In 1969, WIBG-FM's call sign was changed to WPNA when Storer sold WIBG (AM) but kept the FM station. The station remained silent for two years.\n\nHaving been unsuccessful in getting the Sunbury station to agree to an FCC waiver, Storer sold WPNA, along with WCJW in Cleveland, Ohio, to SJR Communications for a combined $1.4 million. (SJR stood for \"San Juan Racing,\" referring to the company's lone U.S. holding: a horse racing track in San Juan, Puerto Rico.) SJR changed the call sign to WYSP (\"Your Station in Philadelphia\"), and quickly made a deal with the Sunbury station that allowed WYSP to increase its power. The station became a full Class B. The effective radiated power (ERP) was boosted to 39,000 watts and the tower was increased to 550 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT).\n\nOn August 23, 1971, WYSP went on the air. The format consisted of live announcers playing big band and easy listening music from half-hour-long reel-to-reel tapes that were produced in-house. The WYSP studios were located in the Suburban Station Building at 16th and JFK Parkway in Philadelphia. A new RCA transmitter and circular polarized five-bay Gates antenna were installed at the transmitter site.\n\nAt 6 a.m. on August 6, 1973, the easy listening and big band music abruptly stopped, and WYSP began playing album-oriented rock (AOR). The entire announcing staff was fired (despite attempts to unionize), and five new announcers were hired, including Tom Straw and Dean Clark. The music included popular cuts from top-selling rock albums by artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Chicago, and Crosby Stills and Nash. Radio consultant Kent Burkhart was signed up. He hired Dick Findley from WEBN in Cincinnati to be the Program Director, Music Director, handle the promotions, and host middays. With promotional help from artists like Aerosmith, Jimmy Buffett, and Charlie Daniels, the station took off. After a series of concerts in the park, high school hops and public involvement, the station beat rock competitor WMMR by more than 2 to 1 in the ratings. It was at that point in 1975-1976 that the station peaked. New consultant Ken Abrams began \"The Fox & Leonard Morning Show\" (Sonny Fox & Bob Leonard), the first two-man morning show on AOR radio.\n\nIn 1974, WYSP became Philadelphia's \"quad\" station, piping its audio through a Sony Quadrophonic encoder, which provided \"ambience\" effects to the rear channels of the handful of quad radios in the market. Due to a compatibility problem with regular mono radios, and a lack of interest from the listening public, the quad encoder was quietly dismantled in 1976.\n\nIn 1977, the station moved its transmitter to its current location at the Philadelphia master antenna farm in Roxborough.\n\nIn June 1979, Program Director Steve Sutton was hired to put a failing WYSP back on track. Assembling a line-up of Jerry Abear, Sean McKay and Bill Fantini (6-10a), Denny Somach (10a-2p), Randy Kotz (2-6p), Gary Bridges (6-10p), Cyndy Drue (10p-2a) and Trip Reeb (2-6a), the station broke artists like Tom Petty in Philadelphia. Sutton hired popular Eagles linebacker Frank LeMaster for mornings during football season. The station was loud, uptempo and cutting edge. Production, including outrageous spots and promos, came from Jay Gilbert and later, R.D. Steele, making WYSP unique. The station was hugely creative, generating syndicated shows picked up by other album rock stations around the country. \n\nIn 1981, WYSP was acquired by the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. Infinity had been buying FM rock stations in large cities. It already owned WKTU in New York City, WBCN in Boston and KOME in San Jose.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, WYSP became one of the first radio stations to switch to \"Classic Rock.\" Account Executive Jim Sacony gave General Manager Frank X. Feller a reel-to-reel tape with a sample of what the Classic Rock format would sound like. The featured artists on the reel to reel were The Yardbirds, The Zombies, The Young Rascals, Van Morrison, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Steppenwolf and The Byrds.\n\nFeller liked what he heard and directed Program Director and Midday DJ Dick Hungate to team up with station consultant Lee Abrams to come up with a plan. They wanted to better compete with the two more-established rock stations, 93.3 WMMR and 102.1 WIOQ. The actual on-air description, \"Classic Rock,\" was thought of in a strategy session, in which other adjectives such as \"timeless\" and \"vintage\" also were discussed by Hungate and Abrams. Hungate created a playlist of older rock tracks based upon his previous Philly experience as Music Director of WMMR in 1978-79. For the on-air playlist, Hungate used metal file boxes and color-coded 3\" X 5\" index cards to manually rotate titles depending on each song's popularity.\n\nIn 1995, WYSP abandoned classic rock for a new contemporary hard rock format during a period when former WMMR morning host John DeBella joined the station. WYSP returned to classic rock again a few years later, but ultimately switched back to a current, hard-rock format.\n\nIn 1996, Infinity Broadcasting merged with CBS Radio. CBS already owned rival rock station WMMR, and the Infinity merger left CBS one station over the FCC's ownership limit at that time. WMMR was sold to Greater Media. This left empty space at the KYW-AM-TV studios on Independence Mall, which served as the headquarters for CBS' broadcasting operations in Philadelphia. On April 5, 1997, WMMR and WYSP switched studios, with WYSP moving to 5th and Market Street near Independence Mall in Downtown Philadelphia and WMMR moving to Bala Cynwyd.\n\nOver its years as a rock station, WYSP sometimes added talk-intensive or talk-based shows during the daytime hours. In 1986, WYSP was the first affiliate when \"The Howard Stern Show\" began syndicating from its New York City home base. Stern was often the top show in the ratings when he was heard in mornings from 6-10 a.m. on WYSP. (Stern left for Sirius Satellite Radio in 2005.) \n\nOver time, other syndicated shows made WYSP their Philadelphia home, including \"Opie and Anthony\" and \"Don and Mike\". While some shows proved successful in their time slot, the station did not retain many of them, usually replacing them with the music format.\n\nOn October 25, 2005, CBS Radio switched WYSP and several other Stern affiliates to the \"Free FM\" format. From its inception until early 2007, WYSP featured hot talk on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. A mix of talk and music was heard from 7 to 10 p.m. WYSP aired all music after 10 p.m. and around the clock on weekends.\n\nFor many years, WYSP simulcast Philadelphia Eagles NFL games, while co-owned WIP was the primary flagship station. From April 2006 to October 2007, the station carried Opie and Anthony's syndicated talk show in the morning, after David Lee Roth's syndicated Free FM morning show failed to garner good ratings.\n\nAt 11:59 p.m. on March 16, 2007, WYSP D.J. Jacky Bam Bam (now with WMMR) signed off at the station's studios at 5th and Market Streets, also shared with KYW, KYW-TV, and WPSG, before switching over to the new studios one block away, located on the 9th floor at 4th and Market. (KYW (AM) is also located in the same building, but on the 10th floor.) The first all-talk broadcast from the new studios, the 9 a.m. \"Barsky Show\", was broadcast on March 19, 2007, with minor, but correctable problems.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, WYSP added the \"Scotty and Alex Show\" to replace Couzin Ed. While they continued to play music, their show was part of the mostly-talk Free-FM format. On April 17, Scotty and Alex stopped playing music. WYSP also began to carry the syndicated \"Loveline\" and \"John and Jeff shows\", effectively ending weekday music programming.\n\nDuring the week of June 18, 2007, WYSP stopped calling its talk format \"Free FM.\" New imaging was slowly rolled out which referred to the station as either \"94-1 WYSP\" or \"94 WYSP.\" During the week of June 25, a new \"94 WYSP Talks\" logo was unveiled on the station website, wiping clean any reference to \"Free FM\" from the station's identity. On August 13, during the first \"Eagles Radio\" broadcast of the year, new imaging began to refer to the station as \"Philadelphia's FM Talk Station.\" A similar nickname also began to be used by corporate sister station KLSX in Los Angeles.\n\nIn June 2007, long time music programmer Gil Edwards was let go, further evidence that WYSP was committed to talk programming. Edwards lobbied for a return to rock before leaving but was rebuffed by management.\n\nOn September 11, 2007, an article was published in the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" reporting a format change at WYSP was imminent. Paul Barsky brushed the article off as rumor, as did Matt of the \"Matt and Huggy Show\" and Kidd Chris. Scotty and Alex referred to their show that night as their \"last\" show, claiming that not many radio shows get to do a final broadcast. They hoped to return the next day, but it turned out that night's show really was their last.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Paul Barsky stated that he had re-signed with the station, and his show continued as normal with guest Donovan McNabb of the Philadelphia Eagles. Promos for the station would later be heard featuring McNabb announcing that \"The Rock Is Back,\" which had been recorded the day of his appearance. At the start of Kidd Chris' broadcast, he discussed the topic of the format change, revealing that Scotty, Alex, Matt and Huggy had been fired, the \"Barsky Show\" was no more, and that Chris himself had lost members of his show (later revealed to be co-producer \"Monkeyboy\" Dave Eitel and producer Brad Maybe). \n\nThe following day, Opie and Anthony broadcast their show from the WYSP studios. They joked about the lack of secrecy about the format change. Articles about the switch appeared in that day's \"Philadelphia Daily News\" and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". Opie joked about the \"94 WYSP, The Rock Station\" sweatshirt Anthony was wearing and the tearing down of a \"94 WYSP Talks\" poster in the studio. \n\nAt 5 p.m., WYSP switched back to an active rock format, without the alternative lean previously heard during WYSP's last months as a music station. Only Opie and Anthony in the morning drive slot and Kidd Chris as the afternoon host remained. The first three songs on the return of WYSP's rock format were \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses, \"Back In Black\" by AC/DC, and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana.\nOn October 23, 2007, WYSP ceased airing the syndicated Opie and Anthony Show, replacing them with music. October 23, 2007 was also the last day Kidd Chris's show aired in the 3-7 PM slot. He ended his show with \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey, and music took over his time slot the next day. For nearly a month, he was in talks with the station for a new contract, and was expected to return in the morning slot. On November 25th, WYSP's website announced that Kidd Chris would be returning the following day, with his show airing from 6-10 a.m., Opie and Anthony's old time slot.\n\nKidd Chris remained the morning host for seven months until May 16, 2008, when CBS terminated Chris and WYSP program director John Cook due to an offensive song called \"Schwoogies\" which first aired on March 21 and several times there after. The song referred to African-Americans in slang terms that station management determined to be highly offensive.\n\nOn August 25, 2008, WYSP returned to the classic rock format it shed in 1995, using the slogan \"The Rock You Grew Up With from the 70s, 80s, & 90s.\" WYSP's version of classic rock had a harder direction than that of the market's other classic rock station, WMGK, WMMR's sister station.\n\nFormer \"Partridge Family\" TV star Danny Bonaduce was named the new morning drive host for WYSP, with his program beginning on November 10, 2008. \n\nWYSP's sister station, WIP, had been airing a popular all-sports format since 1988; by 2009, it had to compete with an FM sports rival, WPEN-FM. Speculation had grown that CBS would want an FM counterpart to capitalize on WIP's popularity.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, CBS Radio announced that WIP would begin simulcasting its sports format on 94.1 FM, starting on September 6th, thus ending music on 94.1. The change actually took place on September 2nd, four days earlier than announced. On its final day, Howard Stern called into the station to discuss his time on WYSP with host Spike Eskin. At 3:00 p.m. that day, WYSP ended its music format with \"Fade to Black\" by Metallica as its final song. The WYSP classic rock programming was then moved to its HD-3 subchannel. The station switched its call sign to WIP-FM.\n\nShortly after WIP-FM began its simulcast with WIP (AM), the two stations began to sometimes split, with certain sporting events not heard on both frequencies. Most Philadelphia Phillies broadcasts, heard on WIP-FM in 2012, were also carried on the AM dial by co-owned WPHT, while WIP (AM) aired other sports programming. The syndicated \"Nick & Artie Show\" was added to 610 AM's programming in February 2012, while local programming continuing on WIP-FM. The simulcast ended entirely January 2, 2013, when WIP became a full-time affiliate of CBS Sports Radio, with local sports programming continuing to air on WIP-FM.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, CBS Radio announced that it would trade 14 radio stations located in Tampa, Charlotte and one AM station in Philadelphia, WIP (AM), to the Beasley Broadcast Group in exchange for three stations in Miami and two FM stations in Philadelphia, WXTU and WRDW-FM. WIP-FM was not affected by this transaction, remaining with CBS.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nWIP-FM is short-spaced to WQKX \"94KX\" (licensed to serve Sunbury, Pennsylvania) as they both operate on the same channel and the cities they are licensed to serve are only about 106 miles apart. The minimum distance between two co-channel Class B FM radio stations according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.\n\n"}

His father, Tegid ap Iago, may have borne the Roman name of \"Tacitus\". Padarn is believed to have been born around AD 400 in the \"Old North\" (or Hen Gogledd) of Roman Britain. According to Old Welsh tradition, his grandson, Cunedda certainly came from Manaw Gododdin, the modern Clackmannanshire region of Scotland.\n\nOne traditional interpretation identifies Padarn as a Roman (or Romano-British) official of reasonably high rank who had been placed in command of Votadini troops stationed in Clackmannanshire in the 380s or earlier by the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Alternatively, he may have been a frontier chieftain in the same region who was granted Roman military rank, a practice attested elsewhere along the empire's borders at the time.\n\nHis command in part of what is now Scotland probably lasted till his death and was then assumed by his son Edern (Edeyrn=\"Eternus\"). Edern was the father of Cunedda, founder of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.\n\nThe coat of Padarn Redcoat is one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, where it is said to fit perfectly any well-born noble man, but not a churl.\n\nThe Life of Saint Padarn mistakes this Padarn with the saint, and contains a moral-Christian propaganda story about how King Arthur tried to steal his tunic and became Christian afterwards.\n\nIn M J Trow's fictional \"Britannia\" series, Padarn Beisrudd is one of the central characters. He is given the latinised name of Paternus and portrayed as a limitanei soldier guarding Hadrian's Wall.\n"}

The magazine is owned by American Media Inc. and overseen by AMI's Chief Content Officer, Dylan Howard.\n\n\"Star\" was founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1974 as competition to the tabloid \"National Enquirer\" with its headquarters in New York City. In the late 1980s it moved its offices to Tarrytown, NY and in 1990 Murdoch sold the magazine to the \"Enquirer\"s parent company American Media, Inc. (Murdoch now owns the \"New York Post\", which, although it has more of a regional, news-centered focus, still has significant celebrity coverage.)\n\nOriginally an unstapled, inexpensive, supermarket tabloid printed on newsprint, \"Star\" was hugely successful but remained in the shadow of its longer-established stablemate. Along with the \"Enquirer\" its circulation declined with the advent of celebrity-driven television shows such as \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"Hard Copy\".\n\nIn 1999, AMI was bought by investors fronted by David Pecker, who personally pledged that \"Star\" would never relocate to Florida, the home state of all the country's other tabloids. However, it took Pecker less than a year to renege on his promise and \"Star\" was moved into AMI's headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, sharing the building with the \"Enquirer\" and AMI's other recently acquired titles \"The Globe\", \"National Examiner\", and \"Sun\". Editor Phil Bunton was replaced before the move when he angered Pecker by telling the \"New York Post\": \"It's going to be open warfare. How we're going to all work together I don't know. It's like having the Bosnians, Croats, the Jews and Arabs all together in the same area.\" Virtually all \"Star\"s staff of experienced tabloid journalists refused to make the move south. Four years later, Pecker appointed former \"Us Weekly\" editor Bonnie Fuller to oversee the paper and, at her demand, he moved it back to New York in the summer of 2003.\n\nAt the beginning of 2004, \"Star\" gained new life by switching to a more traditional magazine format, with a higher grade of paper and, denying its tabloid roots, put itself into competition with a new breed of entertainment magazine typified by Time Inc.'s \"People\", Fuller's former publication, Wenner Media's \"Us Weekly\", and the German-owned magazine publisher Bauer's \"In Touch Weekly\". However, its page layout remains tabloid-derived, with sections including \"Worst of the Week\", which points out the most amusing celebrity fashion disasters of the previous week, \"Stars Without Makeup\" section which compares photos of stars with and without makeup, and \"Knifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" section, which illustrates suspected incidences of plastic surgery with before-and-after photos.\n\nAs of 2015, \"Star\" sells for US$4.99 per issue with reduced rate subscriptions varying from 26 to 52 issues.\n\n\"Star\" received attention in 1991 in for running a story about KISS drummer Peter Criss, claiming that he had become homeless and was a habitual drunkard and was living on the streets of Santa Monica, California. In fact, Criss was healthy and happily married at the time. \"Star\" had instead interviewed and photographed a homeless man who had passed himself as Criss for years. The real Peter Criss was mourning his mother at the time and was distressed to learn that his friends and associates believed he had fallen on hard times.\n\nIn 2011, the actress Katie Holmes sued \"Star\" magazine for libel after the tabloid published a story about her that suggested she abused drugs. The original lawsuit was for $50 million, but the case was settled before going into court for an undisclosed amount of money. The publisher took matters into print again publicly apologizing to Holmes and disclosing that a substantial donation was going to be done under her name to a charity of her choice.\n\nIt was said by \"Star\" magazine's chief editor that brand loyalty is the most important focus for their industry. This being said, people are only intrigued by the \"juiciest dirt\", leaving the cover page to be where the most gossip, dirt, and biggest celebrity news is to be shown, leaving the audience wanting more. \"Star\" has been accused of publicizing any news that is presented to them, regardless of whether or not it is true. This left Jennifer Aniston stating that \"if you cooperate with one of the magazines, their competitors become vengeful and attack clients. There is no upside to working with them…. Their tactic is to make up stories that are so damaging\", which is why she no longer holds interest in talking to reporters, specifically from \"Star\" magazine.\n\n"}

In , playing for the Pawtucket Red Sox in the Class AAA International League, Shoppach appeared in a career-best 101 games behind the plate for Pawtucket and threw out 35 of 101 potential base stealers (34.7 percent) on his way to a spot on the International League's end-of-season All-Star Team.

{"id": "1949994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949994", "title": "Fort Boyard (game show)", "text": "Fort Boyard (game show)\n\nFort Boyard is a French game show created by Jacques Antoine that was first broadcast on 7 July 1990 (originally as \"Les Clés de Fort Boyard\", however shortened to \"Fort Boyard\" from the second series in 1991). Foreign versions of the show, with varying success, have aired around the world since 1990.\n\nSet and filmed on the real fortress of the same name on the west coast of France, the programme appears similar to British game show \"The Crystal Maze\" which was created as an alternative format by Antoine for Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, after the fortress was unavailable to film in because of its then ongoing refurbishment (during 1989). In both programmes the contestants have to complete challenges to win prize money. However, while \"The Crystal Maze\" varies the type of games quite considerably, \"Fort Boyard\" tends to focus mainly on physical and endurance challenges. Although \"Fort Boyard\" was something of a pioneer in the area of game show fear and adventure, later programmes such as \"Fear Factor\" have pushed things even further, requiring \"Fort Boyard\" to react and adapt with new twists and games, including a couple of seasons in which the contestants spent the night in the Fort (this was particularly popular in the French and Russian versions).\n\n\"Fort Boyard\" is the most exported French TV format and the fourth most exported adventure-style game show format in the world after \"Wipeout\", \"Fear Factor\" and \"Survivor\".\n\nIn 1980, , a co-presenter of Antenne 2's \"\" (the French version of \"Treasure Hunt\"), came close to drowning while trying to reach Fort Boyard in rough seas. He remained stuck for 3 hours before being rescued by helicopter. This episode inspired Jacques Antoine (creator of \"La Chasse aux Trésors\") in the creation of the TV game show \"Fort Boyard\".\n\nThe concept of \"Fort Boyard\" was imagined and outlined in 1986, at a meeting in the company of Antoine to find a game show to succeed \"Treasure Hunt\". The idea of a team game show, adapted from role-playing games such as \"Dungeons & Dragons\", taking place in a mysterious tower populated by extraordinary characters, whose goal is to find a treasure, takes shape in the following years.\n\nWhilst looking for a set, a production team visited Fort Boyard in April 1987 and this fortification, located between the Île-d'Aix and the île d'Oléron in the Pertuis d'Antioche strait, was bought in November 1988 for one and a half million francs. The production company resold the fort to the department of Charente-Maritime for a symbolic franc, resulting in the local authority then having to take charge of all the refurbishment works, which took place from July 1989, and ensured the exclusive use of the site to Antonie's production company. Because of the weather conditions, the construction of the sets for the show was done in two stages: between the start of the renovation and October 1989 then the following spring, and were completed shortly before the first day of filming on 30 June 1990. The original French version, under the name \"Les Clés de Fort Boyard\" (English: \"The Keys of Fort Boyard\"), began airing on 7 July 1990 hosted by Patrice Laffont and originally Marie Talon, later Sophie Davant, on Antenne 2.\n\nThe first country to buy the game show \"Fort Boyard\" (then known as \"Les Clés de Fort Boyard\") was the United Kingdom and broadcaster Channel 4. After discussions with the French producers, production company Chatsworth Television (at the time producers of Channel 4's \"Treasure Hunt\" and ITV's \"Interceptor\", both also game shows created by Antoine) decided to devise a British version and began work on making a concept. According to host Richard O'Brien, the original outlined concept was \"kind of like \"Dungeons and Dragons\"\", with the presenter acting as \"Dungeon Master\".\n\nA non-televised pilot of the show funded by Channel 4 was filmed in a London studio with O'Brien as presenter, as the fort was not available at the time due to its ongoing renovations. Footage of O'Brien's pilot, showing the initial idea for the \"\"Treasure Room\"\" segment of the format, later appears in a casting call advert for the French version, broadcast in May 1990. More footage of the pilot, including the basic set design and some key games (most of which would go on to appear in the series), is featured in \"Fort Boyard : toujours plus fort!\" following the first episode of the 30th French season on 22 June 2019. According to co-creator Mitercey in 2009, the pilot was filmed in February 1989 at Elstree Studios. Six English contestants took part. To be as close as possible to reality, a quarter of the Fortress had been built in the studio using metal structures with 18 cells installed for playing games, which were all tested for the first time. Tigers were also present in the recording, as well as a large statue of Sphinx which posed puzzles (this idea was slightly revised later, with the creation of the Father Fouras character in the watchtower) and some characters like the wrestler. According to O'Brien, the recording of the pilot cost 2 million francs (around €304,900), a record at the time.\n\nIt is said that the considerable changes that Channel 4 wanted to make to the format could not be possible on the Fort, as each broadcaster producing their own version at the time had to strictly follow the French format. Chatsworth were also required by the French producers, but declined, to film their version first in November 1989. As Channel 4 had commissioned the show for a full series, producer Malcolm Heyworth contacted \"Fort Boyard\"'s creator Jacques Antoine about developing an alternative format, with a proposal that it used thematic zones as a means of keeping the show visually fresh. The concept of \"The Crystal Maze\" was developed in just \"two days\", creating a game that, although similar to \"Fort Boyard\", is substantially different in terms of presentation and style. Channel 4's \"The Crystal Maze\" is first aired on 15 February 1990, five months before the French series.\n\nChannel 5 later bought the rights to \"Fort Boyard\" and made their own British version, using the now refurbished set, which aired from 16 October 1998 to 29 December 2001 for four series. It was produced by Paul Kirrage and executive produced by Richard Holloway, later known for producing \"The X Factor\" and other high-profile shows on UK television, for Grundy Productions (later Thames Television in 2001). Although pulling in reasonable ratings for the channel, in March 2002 it was announced that Channel 5 had cancelled the show as part of a station revamp.\n\nIt was briefly revived by Challenge in 2003 for one series, with a ten-part documentary, \"Fort Boyard: Takes On The World\", broadcast in October 2004. \"Fort Boyard\" later returned to UK television in January 2012 under a new format aired on children's channel CITV, \"\". This version ended in December 2014 after five series, the first two of which were co-produced with Disney XD in the United States.\n\nIn the UK, two sets of presenters have been used for \"Fort Boyard\". The first set appeared during the first four series of the show, which were broadcast by Channel 5, with the second appearing in the 2003 Challenge-aired fifth series. The leading presenters of \"Fort Boyard\" on Channel 5 and Challenge were Melinda Messenger (series 1–4) and Jodie Penfold (series 5). Their roles were to give advice and support for the teams, commentate for the viewers, and match wits with Boyard, the \"Master of the Fort\".\n\nThe other characters in \"Fort Boyard\" are:\n\n\nThere is also the resident \"Fort Boyard\" cast, who first appeared in the French version, and were subsequently featured in most of the other international formats, including the original UK versions, however these were all excluded for \"\":\n\nAs of 2014, there have been 41 characters in the French version. Most appeared in various games on the fort.\n\nOn 26 December 1999, a celebrity edition of \"Fort Boyard\" was broadcast, featuring Gabby Logan, Frank Bruno, Sharron Davies, Samuel Kane, and Glenda McKay as contestants. As a one-off, the show's length was extended to 80 minutes so that the team had to get five keys (instead of four) and the code word in fifty-five minutes. The team won £7,910 for their nominated charity.\n\nSeries 3 aired two celebrity editions of \"Fort Boyard\" following the success of the 1999 special; broadcast on 5 January and 25 August 2001, one edition featured Rhodri Williams, Lisa Rogers, \"Handy\" Andy Kane, Tricia Penrose and Phil Gayle as the contestants. Rhodri was the team captain and the team won £14,350 for charity. The other featured Anna Walker, Victor Ubogu, Annalise Braakensiek, Tim Vincent and Troy Titus-Adams. Anna Walker captained the team and they won £7,190 for charity.\n\nAnother celebrity edition aired at the end of series four (episode 14) in 2001 featuring Sally Gray, Scott Wright, Nell McAndrew, Keith Duffy and Tris Payne. Sally Gray was the team captain and the team won £10,130 for charity. Episode 4 of series 4, broadcast on 13 October 2001, was a special featuring contestants from the first series of \"The Mole\".\n\nCelebrity editions were also broadcast during the 2003 series by Challenge. It featured Doug Williams, Nikita (now stars in TNA), Paul Burchill, James Tighe, and Sweet Saraya, all of whom were wrestling stars from British promotion FWA. Doug Williams captained the team. Other celebrities appearing in series 5 included Tim Vine and Craig Phillips, \"Big Brother\" 2000 winner. The team won £1,860 for charity, which was topped up by a further £5,000 because Tim Vine accepted a challenge to tell 10 jokes in one minute.\n\nSince 1993, teams on the French version of the show consist entirely of celebrities. These include: cyclist Laurent Fignon, figure skating champion Brian Joubert (appearing in 2004, 2007, 2008 and 2012), Djibril Cissé, Omar Sy, R&B singer Leslie (in 2002, 2003 and 2013), Tony Parker and Eva Longoria in 2009, and many others. Many former/new hosts of the show have often appeared as contestants.\n\nHowever, in 2010 the formula was dramatically changed and the squads, of four members each, did not consist of any celebrities. The \"duel\" format was used that year. The celebrities returned in 2011 playing for charity. In 2019 French World Cup winning footballer Adil Rami was sacked by Olympique de Marseille for reportedly missing training to appear on the show.\n\nIn most series of the Danish and Swedish versions, teams have consisted entirely of celebrities. In the 2010 and 2012 series of the Finnish version, team members were celebrities. Most (or all) episodes of the Russian series consisted of famous national singers, actors, TV presenters and sportsmen.\n\nIn the 2013 Canadian version, the teams consisted of 24 participants in total; 12 celebrities and 12 members of the public, divided into six teams of four equally.\n\nIn the Argentine version of the show, aired in 1999 and 2000, a celebrity joined the other 4 people to help them on their challenges. Argentina's was the first version to have a female character guarding the tower: \"La Dama del Fuerte\" played by Isabel Achaval. This was followed by Germany's Sonya Kraus and Yasemin Kozanoğlu for Turkey both in 2000. On 4 June 2019, Swedish broadcaster TV4 confirmed that Suzanne Reuter would appear in the role as \"Madame Fouras\".\n\nIn the Moroccan version, aired in early 2015 but filmed the previous year, 3 celebrities joined teams with 2 unknown people for the challenges. The first episode of \"Jazirat Al Kanz\" aired on 24 February and was watched by 6.4 million viewers, a record 59% audience share for 2MTV.\n\n\"Fort Boyard\" is a French game show first broadcast in 1990; however the fort is also used by television stations from other countries in order to produce their own (typically modified) versions, using part of the technical teams and characters of the original French show.\n\nFilming takes place during the summer months (May to July, until August in 2000 due to a large number of countries attending) each year. Foreign versions of the show typically last between 22 and 80 minutes per episode, depending on the country and format used. In total, 34 foreign versions have broadcast around the world since 1990.\n\nItaly has only ever made a pilot for \"Fort Boyard\", in 1991. Presumably the host of this unaired version was . The American pilot for ABC, filmed the same year, was eventually broadcast on 20 March 1993.\n\nIn December 2005, it was reported that French producers Adventure Line Productions were in final talks with around three Indian broadcasters to bring the format to the country; however in the end this did not happen. In October 2010, it was reported that Brazil and Tunisia had signed on for filming in 2011. However, no series was later produced for either country. In December 2012, Ukrainian channel ICTV announced they were due to film the country's second season of the show. However, for unknown reasons, the filming did not take place. A Chinese version of the show was confirmed to be filmed in mid-September 2015, however it was later cancelled due to censorship worries.\n\nFollowing the success of the Moroccan version, an African version is aired in 24 countries of French-speaking Africa since September 2019 on .\n\nThe year 2000 contains the most episodes filmed of any year (123 for eleven countries, including France). To date, 2005 has the least (26), with just the French and Greek versions attending. As of 2018, the overall number of episodes filmed is 1,782, of which 327 are of the original French version over 29 seasons. Sweden, is the foreign country which has produced the most episodes to date (222 over 19 seasons).\n\nThe fort has also been used for special private events in 2014, 2016 and 2019 by Russian visitors and filmed shows featuring children for the French sponsor Prince de LU from 2011 to 2013, with Anne-Gaëlle Riccio returning as host. It was confirmed in July 2019 that an unnamed Russian billionaire of a large steel company had hired the Fort three times, firstly in 2014 for a team building session and most recently for his 50th birthday.\n\nLegend:\n\n\"Fort Boyard\" has aired on many networks around the world. Some countries, such as Portugal, aired the original French version dubbed or with subtitles as opposed to producing their own. Others include:\nA number of other countries also did this before producing their own versions in later years. These include: \n\nIn France, reruns of their own version have aired on Gulli (2006–2014), TV5Monde Europe, 1ère, and France 4 since 6 September 2014. In Belgium, since 2017, French-language broadcaster RTBF acquired rights allowing it to broadcast the show on the eve of its release in France. Ukraine (ТЕТ, 2006–2007), Georgia (Rustavi 2, 2010), Slovakia (Dajto, 2013), Algeria (A3), Quebec (Prise 2, 2009–2010), Argentina (, 2019) and the UK have also repeated past series on various channels.\n\n\"Fort Boyard\"'s format varies from country to country, but the basics are the same. A team of friends enter the Fort with the intention of winning the gold. To do this, the contestants have to successfully complete a series of challenges set by Boyard himself.\n\nThe first thing done in the game is the sounding of the Fort's gong by French character 'La Boule'. Once the gong sounds the game time begins ticking down. In the UK version the game lasted for 40 minutes, in the French version 60 to 120 minutes, depending on the year.\n\nThe show's original format is outlined in the following sections, starting with 'Phase One'.\n\nThe first set of challenges the contestants have to complete is to win a certain number of keys (in series 1–4 of the UK version four keys were needed, whereas five were need in series 5; five were needed in the Canadian version, and seven in the Swedish and Danish versions. The current French version requires nine keys). These keys, once won, are used to open the gate to the Treasure Room, a central room in the Fort where the gold is held.\n\nThe challenges that are set to win the keys are located in small cells around the Fort, with small water-timers (a Clepsydre) outside to give the contestant a time limit (around 2–3 minutes, depending on the game) to complete it; in the UK version, Boyard would start the timer upon saying to a contestant that \"their time starts now\", whereas in the 5th series, Boyard would start it after telling Jacques to open the door of a challenge room. If a contestant fails to leave the challenge room before the time runs out, he or she is locked in and then shortly after taken away to a cage (by La Boule or Mr Boo since 2011), meaning they are not allowed to continue with the rest of the key games and must stay there until the end of \"Phase One\". In the UK's 4th series, La Boule would give the contestant a large bunch of rusty keys. One of these keys would unlock the cage allowing the contestant to re-join the team.\n\nDuring this phase of the game, one contestant goes up to the Watch Tower to win an additional key for the team (see below). This could be done once or twice, depending on the season.\n\nOnce the contestants reach the end of Phase One, usually towards the end of their game time, there is a trip to the Treasure Room with all of the keys that they have won so far. If they have enough to unlock the Treasure Room Door then the keys are entered and the gate is unlocked. However, it does not open until later in the show.\n\nIf they are short of keys to open the gate then team members are 'sacrificed' for keys, one team member for each key short. The 'sacrificed' contestants are then placed in an underground cell and locked in. These team members remain for the rest of the game, and are therefore unable to contribute any more for the team. Although this never happened, hypothetically at least in Series 5 in the UK, if no keys were won in Phase One, it would have been impossible for the team to continue the game since in Series 5 in the UK five keys were needed to open the treasure room door, and since there are only five contestants, and no one is allowed to swim for the Captain's keys, every contestant would have to make a sacrifice for all five keys, leaving no contestants spare to get clue words to work out the code word and release the gold.\n\nIn the seasons of the French version from 2011 onward, if a team is short of keys, then team members could be 'sacrificed' by facing \"Judgment\" \"(Le Jugement)\", hosted by the character Blanche. Each sacrificed team member would have to complete a challenge of skill or luck set by Blanche. If the sacrificed team member was successful in his/her challenge, Blanche would grant him/her their freedom and would be able to rejoin the team. However, if the team member fails the challenge, he or she would be sent to prison. Team members who were locked in during a Phase One challenge can also win their freedom by facing Blanche and succeeding at the proposed challenge.\n\nIf the team has more keys than necessary to unlock the gate then any extra keys gained can be swapped for free clue words to assist the team in the next phase of the game.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2014, there were 185 different events (key games). The name of the game may change, but the game itself usually remains the same; where possible, this list will use the names from \"Ultimate Challenge\".\n\nNote: This is NOT the full list of games that have been played. The years below are for when the game was played or last present at the fort, in the French version or \"Ultimate Challenge\" (some games are present but not played every year). A full list of games can be found here.\n\nHere is a selection of some of these challenges:\n\n\n\n\nNote: Some clue games are also played as key games and vice versa.\n\nOnce again in this part of the game the contestants have to complete a series of challenges, but instead of playing for keys they are playing for clue words. In addition, these games are more physically and mentally challenging to the contestants than those played in \"Phase One\". Before these challenges, one contestant goes to the Watch Tower to try to win a clue word. \"Phase Two\" is around 10–20 minutes long in the UK version, this depends on how long the team take to win the required number of keys needed to open the Treasure Room gate.\n\nThe objective in this phase is to try to figure out the password, which, if answered correctly, will release the gold. To do this, they must try to win clue words to help them in working out the password.\n\nThese clue words can be placed either before or after the password to make a common phrase. For example: if the clues words were \"hall\" and \"line\" then the password would be \"dance\", as in \"dance hall\" and \"line dance\".\n\nTo make it even more difficult to get the clue word, a time limit (3 minutes usually; occasionally between 2:00–3:30 minutes) is placed on each game. The clue words are usually written on pieces of paper and kept in canisters filled with gunpowder, and if the contestant fails to reach the canister in the allotted time the clue word explodes and the contestant loses the challenge. Unlike the First Phase, players are not locked in a cage if they fail to win the clue word.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2011, there were 71 different adventures. This section details some of \"Fort Boyard\"s most famous games. The name of the game may change from country-country; but the game itself remains the same (like in Phase One, where possible, names from \"Ultimate Challenge\" will be used). The years below are for when the game was played or last present at the fort, in the French version or \"Ultimate Challenge\".\n\nExamples of the clue games, also known as \"ordeals\" or \"adventures\", are:\n\n\n\nNote: Some of these games are still in place on the fort, but have not been played recently in the French version and others. Most of these games are listed by their \"Ultimate Challenge\" names. Not all of the clue games played have been mentioned above.\n\nIn the \"Watch Tower\" of the Fort lives a usually eccentric character that sets riddles for certain contestants; if the contestants give the correct answer within the time limit, they receive a key. In the case of the clue riddles, the answer to the riddle is the clue word, so even if the contestant doesn't solve it in the \"Watch Tower\" he or she can still think about it during the rest of the game. During the riddles, the contestant can keep guessing until the time (indicated by Jack or Jules holding up a sand timer) has elapsed. If the contestant fails to guess the correct answer within the time limit, the key is \"thrown\" into the sea, and another contestant has to swim for it. This was always won as the strongest swimmer would retrieve the key. The swim was removed in series 5 of the UK version, but was re-introduced in \"Ultimate Challenge\" as Key to the Sea (without the \"Watch Tower\" riddle).\n\nSince 2006, the contestants can no longer swim for the key; it is just put back where it was held. The clue word is also different and is not the same as the riddle. Therefore, the riddle must be solved within the time limit to obtain the clue.\n\nIn the French version from 2011 to 2013, \"The Watch Tower\" wasn't used; instead, there were three trips to the Interactive Cell. The second trip was a Visual Riddle, about halfway through the key games, with Father Fouras on screen. The Clue Riddle is replaced by a telephone riddle where the player is in a booth inside one of the cells and has 1 minute to solve the riddle, given by Father Fouras over the phone, whilst cockroaches are dropped on top of them. This takes form of a game, called Abandoned Cabin, in the French version. \"The Watch Tower\" was however used in the 2012 Russian version of the show (the only country to use it that year) and in 2013 for the Azerbaijan, Canadian and Swedish versions.\n\nThe Treasure Room (or Treasure Chamber in \"Ultimate Challenge\") is the climax to each episode of \"Fort Boyard\". The gold is stored here, which is guarded by Boyard's tigers (except in \"Ultimate Challenge\" until 2013).\n\nOnce the Fort's gong sounds for a second time, the game time is over. When the gong is struck (by La Boule) the tigers are taken away by Monique, the gate to the Treasure Room rises and will only stay open for 2:00 minutes in UK series 1 to 4 (the time stated did not include the 20 seconds before the gate started to rise) or 3:00 minutes in UK series 5. The 3 minutes includes 20 seconds before the gate started to rise (to open canisters/organise team). The gate takes 30 seconds to open and close fully for every version of \"Fort Boyard\" worldwide.\n\nAs of 2016, in the French version, contestants who failed at the duels during the \"judgment\" sequence will have the chance to free themselves by making their way through an obstacle course within 2:30, with any time used in excess of 2:30 taken away from the three minutes the contestants have in the treasure room. This is then followed by extra games which are played to win extra time in the treasure room. Four or six members of the team each compete in a duel against the \"Masters of Time\". There is no risk of any time lost with 15 seconds earned for each successful duel, making a maximum possible time in the treasure room of four minutes.\n\nIf by this time the team has still not figured out the password from the clues won, they can \"sacrifice\" players in exchange for extra clues to help them. The sacrificed players have to grab the clue by putting their hand into one of the tiger-shaped hand traps around the Treasure Room entrance; once their hands are inside, they cannot release them and participate in collecting the gold.\n\nThe contestants then have to spell out the password on the giant alphabet on the floor of the treasure room by standing on the corresponding letters on the grid and using cannonballs if there are not enough players. The team must also ensure the word is spelled correctly, as a mistake could cost them the prize.\n\nOnce this is done, Monique/Félindra rotates the tiger's head (a statue), and the word will either be declared correct or incorrect, and the gold is released if the word is correct. Then the contestants have the remaining time to collect as much gold as they can and place it in a bucket outside of the treasure room. It is only what is in this bucket that they get to keep; any that lands on the floor is not counted. When the time is nearly up in the treasure room, a bell rings, and the gate begins to close slowly. The contestants have to leave before the gate shuts completely because when the door shuts the tigers are released back into the treasure room. (the release of the tigers is delayed until the contestants are out of the treasure room, a portcullis is pulled in some versions to block the tigers from being released). In the 1990 French version, and in the 2006 Russian version of the show, contestants were \"locked\" in the treasure room. On the second occasion, the gold collected was lost as a result.\n\nIf, however, they declare an incorrect word, the gold is not released and instead the gate to the treasure room begins to close immediately, prompting the contestants to make a quick escape, and they complete the game with no winnings.\n\nThe won gold is then weighed and converted into currency; this makes the contestants' prize money. In most countries, the money won by the team is given to a charity.\n\nSome countries, including Spain, Argentina, the UK, and Belgium, give the money directly to the members of the team. Some give vacations instead of money, dependent on how much the team won.\n\nIn France, between 1990 and 1992, the treasure was given to the team, but since 1993, the whole prize goes to charity. Then again in 2010, the prize money was given to the contestants.\n\nIn total, 57 episodes were shown in the original Channel 5 series; including four celebrity specials and a special edition with contestants from the first UK series of \"The Mole\".\n\nOn 1 July 2014, Challenge announced on social media that they had re-acquired all the Channel 5 years of the show (previously repeated by the channel from 2002 to 2006) and would begin airing series 1–2 in August that year, with series 3 and 4 following in 2015. Series 1 started on 4 August at 5 pm, followed by series 2 on 18 August 2014. Series 3 starts on 7 May 2015 at 6 pm.\n\nFrom a broadcasting perspective, Fort Boyard itself was refurbished during 1988–89 to become, essentially, a large outdoor television studio. The Fort has its own doctor, catering facilities, as well as production gallery and veterinary centre.\n\nThe Fort is equipped with 10 portable television cameras, one camera crane for overhead shots, one under-water camera as well as a number of smaller cameras which specifically cover individual games and challenges around the Fort.\n\nThe majority of shows are filmed in the aspect ratio, although some shows, for countries including Sweden and France since 2008, now use the more common widescreen aspect ratio. PAL is the favoured recording format for \"Fort Boyard\", offering the highest quality pictures. From 2013, the fort is now able to record programmes in HD for the first time.\n\nIn 1996, at the height of the French version's popularity, a mini-series entitled \"Fort Boyard at Night\" was shown in the autumn. It was filmed entirely at night, and the teams also had slightly more time in which to complete the challenges. In 1997, there were three night-time specials, at Halloween, Christmas, and New Year. In 2012, three further night-time editions were filmed and aired between Halloween (31 October) and Christmas (22 and 29 December).\n\nIn some of the French (Seasons 14–16, 2003–2005) and Russian versions (2003–2004), the contestants stay overnight in the Fortress. During this time, they played endurance, mind, and psychological games both for the release of any prisoners they may have had, and for keys to, or time in, the \"Treasure Room\" at the end of the game.\n\nAlthough most seasons have seen changes (not least in hosts), recent changes to the French version of \"Fort Boyard\" included:\n\n\nHall of Imprints\n\nThe Duels\nThe Treasure Room\n\n\n2009 saw many more changes. Main changes included new opening titles, graphics and a \"wall of progress\" which Demi (Passe Muraille) was in control of which lined the wall of the Fort (the wall above the \"Treasure Room\"). There were 6 new key games and 2 new clue games in 2009. \n\nExtra Games\n\nThe Duels\n\nThe Treasure Room\n\nSince 2003, a duel/tournament format has been used by other countries, who prefer this version of \"Fort Boyard\". Two teams play in the Fort at the same time, with only one of them winning at the end. A similar format was used in 1991.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, a formula with duels between three countries (Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey) was used; two countries (Belgium and Netherlands) in 1991 and with teams of teenagers in 2011 (United Kingdom and United States).\n\nCountries that have used this format include:\n\nIn 2010, the duel format was introduced to the show following the low ratings for the previous season in 2009. Although, this was not successful in the French version and was later dropped the same year. The show returned to a more classical version in 2011.\n\nThe changes made to the French version in 2010 were:\n\nMain overview\n\nGame Play\nThe Treasure Room\n\n\nMain overview\n\n\nThe Duels\n\nThe Hall of Judgement\n\nThis takes place after the key games. \"The Hall of Judgement\" provides opportunities for candidates to obtain the missing keys against the sacrifice of one of them but also to free the team members locked in during the first half. The challenges are set by new female character, the White Judge; played by Louise-Marie Hustings in 2011, then Raphaëlle Lenoble during 2012, and Delphine Wespiser since 2013 (who was a contestant at Halloween 2012). The challenges used are similar to those on \"The Cube\" and \"Minute to Win It\".\n\n\nThe Treasure Room\n\nMain overview\n\n\nThe Duels\n\nThe Duels\n\nThe Cage\n\nPrisoner Escape\n\nThe Duels\n\nThe music for the original French version of \"Fort Boyard\" was composed by Paul Koulak, a French music composer. He composed the main themes for the show as well as the incidental music and game music that is used throughout the show. His music has been used for every version of \"Fort Boyard\" around the world, except the German version, where they composed their own music for the show and games.\n\nUp to 2017, seven different opening theme songs have been used on the show; the first was used until 1994, the second in 1995, the third from 1996 to 2000, the fourth in 2001 and 2002 (used by the UK in 2003 during the Treasure Room), the \"Dance Version\" (used by France during the end credits of the night editions in 1996 and the UK from 1999 to 2001), the sixth theme song which was introduced in the 2003 French version and the seventh, introduced in 2016. \"Fort Boyard Ultimate Challenge\" uses a different opening theme and game music but does use the recent French opening credits and logo.\n\nBroadcast in October 2004 by Challenge, \"Fort Boyard: Takes On The World\" was a ten-part documentary which introduced British viewers to various different versions of the show from around the world. Comedian and former contestant Tim Vine provided the voiceover. The show was split into sections including \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\", \"Heroes and Zeroes\" and \"The A-Z of Fort Boyard\".\n\nThere were also interviews with various characters of the Fort (with the humour provided by the fact that Tim cannot speak French and the characters cannot speak English).\n\nSome of the original music for \"Fort Boyard\" was released on CD in France, both on CD single and CD album form, in 1996 and again in July 1999 as \"Fort Boyard: La Musique de Toutes Les Aventures\".\n\nFred Burton created a comic book adaptation of the French-language edition of the show, published by .\n\n\"Fort Boyard: Le Défi\" is a PC CD-ROM game based on the television show and released in 1995. It provides the player the possibility to become a team member, playing the well known game in the Fort. The game was created by Microids, France Televisions and R&P Electronic Media. The game was available in French and Dutch.\n\n\"Fort Boyard: La Legende\" is an action adventure game, based in and around La Rochelle and on \"Fort Boyard\". It was released in 1996 by Expand Images, Microïds, France Télévisions, and R&P Electronic Media. It was only released in the original French version (as a tie-in to the game show) and the later Dutch-spoken versions. The lack of an English version made this game highly obscure: it doesn't have a MobyGames entry. The hero of this game has no name; he is going to look for a treasure that was hidden by Napoleon at \"Fort Boyard\". For this he needs to look around for clues, and get people to help, in and around La Rochelle.\n\n\n"}

The top of the building is at a height of 173 metres (568 feet).\n\nThe congregation was founded in 1831 and built a log cabin on the north bank of the Chicago River in 1834. In 1838, it moved the cabin across the river to the corner of Washington and Clark Streets. The current structure was completed after a debate within the congregation whether the church should remain in central Chicago or sell its valuable property and relocate to the growing suburban areas. It had its roots on John Wesley's teaching.\n\nThe Chicago Temple Building is a 173-meter (568 foot) tall skyscraper church located at 77 W. Washington Street in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is home to the of the First United Methodist Church of Chicago. It was completed in 1924 and has 23 floors dedicated to religious and office use. It is by one measure the tallest church building in the world based on the distance from the church's street level entrance to the top of the church's spire or steeple. Although by stipulating that a church building's usage be entirely or almost entirely devoted to religious purposes, then, by that standard, Ulm Minster in Ulm, Germany at 161.5 metres (530 feet) in height is the tallest church in the world.\n\nIt was the tallest building in Chicago from 1924 until 1930, when it was surpassed by the Chicago Board of Trade Building. This claim included the height of the steeple to maintain the title over the 35 East Wacker Building which opened in 1927.\n\nThe building is constructed on a steel frame faced with limestone and is designed in the neo-gothic style by the firm of Holabird & Roche. During planning and construction, the building was called \"City Temple\", however by the time of completion, the name was changed to \"Chicago Temple\".\n\nThe building houses three sanctuaries:\n\nThe Sky Chapel was created in 1952 as a gift from the Walgreen family in memory of Charles Walgreen, the founder of the eponymous pharmacy chain. At above ground level, it is considered the world's highest worship space and contains 16 stained glass windows.

He was a popular sex symbol in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBorn in New York City, Donahue was the son of a retired stage actress and the manager of the motion-picture department of General Motors. Donahue stated in a 1959 interview:\nActing is all I ever wanted. Ever since I can remember, I've studied and read plays. My mother would help me, but my parents didn't want me to become an actor. They preferred something more stable—doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, anything.\n\"I can remember always being exposed to Broadway and theater people,\" he added in 1984. \"I can remember sitting with Gertrude Lawrence while she read her reviews in \"The King and I\".\"\n\nTo please his parents, Donahue attended a New York military academy, where he met Francis Ford Coppola. He was going to attend West Point, but suffered a damaged knee at a track meet. He volunteered for the army, but was rejected.\n\nWhen Donahue was 18, he moved to New York and got a job as a messenger in a film company founded by his father (who had died when he was 14). He was fired, he says, because he was too young to join the union. He attended Columbia University and studied journalism. He acted in summer stock in Bucks County. He trained briefly with Ezra Stone, and then moved to Hollywood.\n\nOne evening, producer William Asher and director James Sheldon spotted Donahue in a diner in Malibu and arranged for a screen test with Columbia Pictures, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nSome time later, Donahue was in a car accident in which he drove off a road and plunged 40 feet down a canyon.\n\nActress Fran Bennett introduced him to agent Henry Willson, who represented Rock Hudson, among others. Willson signed him and changed his name to Troy Donahue.\n\n\"At first they had Paris, the lover of Helen of Troy, in mind,\" Donahue says. \"But I guess they thought they couldn't name me Paris Donahue because there was already a Paris, France, and Paris, Illinois.\" He later added, \"it took me five minutes to get used to [my]\" new name.\n\nDonahue signed with Universal Studios in October 1956. They started him off in small roles in films such as \"Man Afraid\", \"Man of a Thousand Faces\", \"The Tarnished Angels\", \"Above All Things\", and \"The Monolith Monsters\" (all 1957).\n\nIn 1958, he was also used in \"Summer Love\", and had a slightly bigger part in \"Live Fast, Die Young\". He began appearing on TV in a guest part in \"Man Without a Gun\". This was followed by parts in \"This Happy Feeling\", \"Wild Heritage\", \"Voice in the Mirror\", \"The Perfect Furlough\", and \"Monster on the Campus\" (billed fifth). He often had better roles in TV, guest-starring in episodes of \"The Californians\", \"Rawhide\", \"Wagon Train\", and \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" and The Virginian.\n\nHe later said \"In most of those Universal pictures, if you went out for popcorn you missed me.\"\n\nDonahue achieved good reviews for a brief, but effective part in \"Imitation of Life\" (1959), playing a man who beats up his girlfriend after he discovers she is black.\n\nThe big break of Donahue's career came when he was cast opposite Sandra Dee in \"A Summer Place\", made by Warner Bros. in 1959. The director was Delmer Daves. Warner signed him to a long-term contract. They put him to work guest-starring in episodes of their Western TV series, such as \"Colt .45\" (1959), \"Maverick\" (1959), \"Sugarfoot\" (1959), \"The Alaskans\" (1960), and \"Lawman\" (1960).\n\n\"A Summer Place\" was a hit and made Donahue a name, especially among teenaged audiences. In 1960, he was named by \"Film Daily\" as one of the five \"finds\" of the year. He had a support part in a disaster movie, \"The Crowded Sky\" (1960).\n\nHe was reportedly going to be cast in \"Splendor in the Grass\", but missed out to Warren Beatty.\n\nInstead, Warner Bros. put him in a TV series, \"Surfside 6\" (1960–62), one of several spin-offs of \"77 Sunset Strip\", announced in April 1960. Another spin off was \"Hawaiian Eye\" on which Donahue had guest-starred.\n\nOn \"Surfside 6\", Donahue starred with Van Williams, Lee Patterson, Diane McBain, and Margarita Sierra in the ABC series, set in Miami Beach, Florida.\nDonahue's career got a big break when Joshua Logan dropped out as director of \"Parrish\" (1961); Logan was replaced by Delmer Daves, who brought in Donahue as star, and the film was a hit.\n\nDonahue and Daves reunited for another melodrama, \"Susan Slade\" (1962). They made a fourth film, \"Rome Adventure\" (1962), a romance starring Suzanne Pleshette.\n\nIn 1962, he claimed he received 5,000–7,500 fan letters a week. The following year, exhibitors voted him the 20th most popular star in the US. He was also popular in Japan.\n\nAfter \"Surfside 6\" was cancelled, Donahue joined the cast of another ABC detective series, \"Hawaiian Eye\", for its last season from 1962 to 1963 in the role of hotel director Philip Barton, with Robert Conrad and Connie Stevens in the series lead.\n\n\"I guess because I was blond, blue-eyed, and tanned, people associated me with all those beach movies that were around then, even though I never did one,\" he later said. \"I was always the goody-goody, the guy who did what he was supposed to.\"\n\nHe did appear in a nearly beach-party film, \"Palm Springs Weekend\" (1963), alongside several other Warner Bros. players. As a change of pace, Pleshette and he were cast in a Western \"A Distant Trumpet\" (1964), the last film of director Raoul Walsh.\n\nDonahue also had a brief tenure as a recording artist at the height of his fame in the early 1960s, releasing a handful of singles for Warner Bros. Records, including \"Live Young\" and \"Somebody Loves Me\". However, none of his recordings entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 list.\n\nIn 1965, Donahue was cast as a psychopathic killer opposite Joey Heatherton in \"My Blood Runs Cold\". While Donahue was happy to break type and play a different type of role, it was not well received by the public. His contract with Warner Bros. ended shortly thereafter—although it ran until early 1968, Donahue asked to be released from it in January 1966. Donahue later claimed:\nJack Warner called every studio I used to work for and used his muscle to keep me busted. I was blackballed and everyone in the business knew it. Please print that. I made one film in Europe playing a Victorian astronaut, but no one ever saw it. Then by the time I could get work again, it was too late because my type was already out of fashion.\nHe later reflected on this period, \"They pumped me til the well went dry. My image came out of Warner Bros. and it was one that was on its way out. I think I'm a little deeper than the roles I was given to play.\" In 1967, he said \"Parrish\" had been the most satisfactory of his movies. \"I had the best script and the best opportunity as an actor. Not too many of those came my way. But I did get great exposure at Warner [Bros.]. Now I'm free to call my own shots. I've made more money in two years on my own than the whole time I was under contract.\"\n\nThe work was not very distinguished, however: a spy spoof, \"Come Spy with Me\" (1967); a British adventure tale, \"Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon\" (1967); a Western for Albert Zugsmith, \"The Phantom Gunslinger\" (shot 1967, released 1970).\n\nIn 1967, Donahue walked out of a contract to appear in the play \"Poor Richard\" at the Pheasant Run Playhouse. He was sued for $200,000.\n\nIn 1968, Donahue signed a long-term contract with Universal Studios for films and TV. This lasted a year, and saw him get four roles: guest shots on \"Ironside\" (1968), \"The Name of the Game\" (1968), and \"The Virginian\" (1969), as well as appear in the TV movie \"The Lonely Profession\" (1969).\n\nDonahue declared bankruptcy in 1968 and eventually lost his home. \"I was living like a movie star but wasn't being paid like one,\" he says. \"I lived way over my head and got into great trouble and lost everything. I went from a beautiful home, garden, swimming pool to living in shabby apartments.\"\n\nDonahue later admitted that he began abusing drugs and alcohol at the peak of his career and increased use after his career began to wane:\nI was loaded all the time... I'd wake up about 6:30 in the morning, take three aspirins mixed with codeine, slug down half a pint of vodka and then do four lines of cocaine. That was just so I could get the front door open to peek out and see if I could face the day... I would lie, steal and cheat, all those wonderful things that drunks do. I was crafty. Nobody knew how much I drank then. If a bottle was out on the counter, I'd take a swig when I passed it and quickly put it back.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time judging beauty contests and opening banks,\" Donahue said of this period. He also wrote TV screenplays under a pseudonym.\n\nDonahue was struggling to make his way in a changing Hollywood. As he said later, \"If you're the boy next door and you're supposed to be squeaky clean, all you had to do was let your sideburns grow and suddenly you were a hippie.\" Donahue says when he met casting directors they would ask \"Why don't you comb your hair? How come you have grown a moustache? What are you doing with a beard?\" He also thinks his career was hurt by the fact he was an anti-Vietnam War Democrat while \"everybody assumed I was a Republican\".\n\nHe wrote screenplays under a pseudonym and did \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" on stage in stock.\n\nIn 1969, Donahue moved from Los Angeles to New York City. He said a few years later:\nIt took guts to walk out of Hollywood, but it would have been worse to stay. I had a house, seven black Cadillac convertibles, and two wrecked marriages. I already had my head turned; turning back was easy. It doesn't matter if I have a beard or a crewcut. People respond to me because I have a human quality. I know I'll be put down by Hollywood, but I don't speak to anybody out there anyway... I smoke grass and ride cycles, my lifestyle is casual, but I'm not a dope fiend or a hippie freak. I've found strength in Jesus Christ and he's easier to follow than Zen Buddhism. I'm not strung out. I'm a very reasonable, professional actor.\nWhile in New York Donahue appeared in the daytime CBS drama \"The Secret Storm\" for six months. He later called the role \"the best part I ever had\".\n\nBy this time, Donahue's drug addiction and alcoholism had ruined him financially. One summer, he was homeless and lived in Central Park. \"There was always somebody who could be amused by Troy Donahue,\" he says. \"I'd meet them anywhere, in a park, street, party, in bed. I lived in a bush in Central Park for one summer. I kept everything I had in a backpack.\"\n\nHe had roles in low-budget films such as \"Sweet Savior\" (1971), \"The Last Stop\" (1972), and \"Seizure\" (1974), Oliver Stone's directorial debut.\n\nIn 1974, Francis Ford Coppola cast him in a small part in \"The Godfather Part II\" as the fiancé of Connie Corleone. His character was named Merle Johnson, a nod to Donahue's real name. Donahue was paid $10,000 for the role for one week's work.\n\nDonahue moved back to Los Angeles, where he married for a fourth time. He appeared in \"Cockfighter\" (1974) for director Monte Hellman, and made \"South Seas\" in the Philippines.\n\nHe acted in occasional television guest spots (\"Ellery Queen\", \"The Hardy Boys\", \"CHiPs\") and appeared in whiskey commercials for the Japanese television market. Donahue said in 1978:\nAfter eight years at Warners, I did a few independent pictures that never went any place. I travelled, played stickball, had a few marriages and many affairs. I just totally enjoyed myself and did the things I didn't get to do when I was a kid. Now I've decided I wanna go back to work again and I've been encouraged by a lot of people who feel that I have the talent and everything that goes with it.\nThere was talk of a TV movie, \"Return to a Summer Place\", but it was never made.\n\nAfter his fourth marriage ended in 1981, Donahue decided to seek help for his drinking and drug use. In May 1982, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous which he credited for helping him achieve and maintain sobriety. \"I look upon my sobriety as a miracle,\" he says. \"I simply do it one day at a time. The obsession to not drink has become as big as the obsession to drink. I was very fortunate.\"\n\nDonahue continued to act in films throughout the 1980s and into the late 1990s. He appeared in the feature film \"Grandview USA\" which was shot in Pontiac, Illinois. \"Crowds of teenaged girls would swarm around C. Thomas Howell, and teenaged boys around Jamie Lee Curtis, but the major celebrity was Donahue,\" recalls director Randall Kleiser. \"These women who had grown up with him as their heartthrob followed him everywhere.\"\n\nHowever, he never obtained the recognition that he had in the earlier years of his career. Donahue's final film role was in the 2000 comedy film \"The Boys Behind the Desk\", directed by Sally Kirkland.\n\nDonahue was married four times and had one child, Sean. His first marriage was to actress Suzanne Pleshette, with whom he had twice co-starred in films. They wed on January 5, 1964, in Beverly Hills, and divorced nine months later.\nOn October 21, 1966, Donahue married actress Valerie Allen in Dublin, Ireland. They separated in April 1967, and she filed for divorce in April 1968, charging him with cruelty, divorcing in November 1968.\nDonahue's third marriage was to executive secretary Alma Sharpe. They married on November 15, 1969, in Roanoke, Virginia. \"I couldn't take care of myself, and I knew this friend would take me under her wing,\" he says. They divorced in 1972.\nDonahue's fourth and final marriage was to land developer Vicki Taylor. They were married in 1979 and divorced in 1981. In his final years, Donahue was in a long-term relationship with mezzo-soprano Zheng Cao, to whom he was engaged and with whom he lived in Santa Monica, California.\nDonahue had a son, Sean, by a woman with whom he had a brief relationship in 1969. He only found out about the son in the early 1980s when he ran into the woman again. As he recalled in 1984:\nShe walked over and introduced herself and I remembered that we had been together four or five times in L.A. in 1969. Nothing serious. Just fun and games. She said, \"I'm glad I saw you. I've always wanted to tell you about something. Look over there, Troy.\" I looked and across the room I saw a 13-year-old spitting image of what I looked like when I was young. \"This is your son, Sean,\" she said. \"He's known all his life that you are his father.\"... I see him every couple of weeks now.\nIn 1958, Donahue was jailed for 15 days for speeding. In 1961, his one-time fiancée Lili Kardell sued him for damages, claiming he had hit her without provocation.\n\nOn August 30, 2001, Donahue suffered a heart attack and was admitted to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica. He died three days later on September 2 at the age of 65.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was President from 1963 to 1967. Grunitzky was Prime Minister of Togo from 1956 to 1958 under the French Colonial \"loi cadre\" system, which created a limited \"national\" government in their colonial possessions. He was elected Prime Minister of Togo —still under French administration— in 1956. Following the 1963 coup which killed his nationalist political rival Sylvanus Olympio, Grunitzky was chosen by the military committee of coup leaders to be Togo's second President.\n\nHe was born in Atakpamé in 1913 to a German father (of Polish origin) and a Togolese mother (of Yoruba royalty). He studied civil engineering at the ESTP in Paris and was a public administrator before leaving to form his own company. He was the secretary-general of the Togolese Party of Progress and was elected into the Togolese Representative Assembly in 1951. Grunitzky also served in the French National Assembly from 1951 to 1958, winning elections in 1951 and 1956. Supported by France, he became the Prime Minister of the Republic of Togo on September 12, 1956. The PTP and its northern ally, the Union of Chiefs and Peoples of the North, were defeated in elections held on May 16, 1958 by Sylvanus Olympio's Committee of Togolese Unity (CUT) and their nationalist allies Juvento, and Grunitzky subsequently went into exile.\n\nThe CUT/JUVENTO government declared Togo's independence on April 27, 1960, and Olympio (Grunitzky's chief political rival and brother-in-law) was elected the first president of independent Togo. Following a coup d'état in 1963 that ended with the assassination of President Olympio, Grunitzky was appointed president by the \"Insurrection Committee\" headed by Emmanuel Bodjollé. This was the first military coup in Western Africa following independence, and was organized by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant Étienne Gnassingbé Eyadema. Grunitzky attempted to unify the country by including several political parties in his government. He was, however, toppled in a bloodless military coup led by now-Lt. Col Étienne Gnassingbé Eyadema and was exiled to Paris.\n\nHe was injured in a car accident in Côte d'Ivoire, and died from complications in a hospital in Paris in 1969.\n\n\nMuch of the content of this article comes from the (retrieved 27 May 2005).\n"}

It should not be confused with Grand Traverse Bay of Lake Superior, located on the Keweenaw Peninsula.\n\nTraverse City is situated at the south end of the bay where the Boardman River empties into the west arm. Cherry orchards line the bay region, giving rise to Traverse City's claim to be the \"Cherry Capital of the World\". Several nationally known companies offer cherry-based products made with Northern Michigan tart cherries including Traverse Bay Farms, Cherry Central, Fruit Advantage, American Spoon, Cherry Republic and Old Mission Traders (formerly Cherry Stop). The region is the center of cherry production in Michigan.\n\nThe Grand Traverse Bay includes an East and West arm and several important smaller bays: Northport Bay, Suttons Bay, Omena Bay, Bowers Harbor, and Old Mission Bay. Northport Bay, located at the northwest corner of Grand Traverse Bay is about long and wide. Northport Bay open to the east, except inside the arms at each end, with the Leelanau Peninsula on the West side. There are several shoals in Northport Bay marked by buoys. Bellow Island, a low gravel island covered by shrubs and located near the middle of Northport Bay, is owned by the Nature Conservancy; it is primarily known as a bird rookery, and is sometimes locally called \"Gull Island\".\n\nThere are several marinas on the bay, including the large marinas in Northport, Greilickville, Traverse City, and Elk Rapids.\n\n\n\nGrand Traverse Bay earned its name from 18th-century French voyageurs who made ', or \"the long crossing\", across the mouth of bay. The area was owned by the French, followed by Great Britain as the Province of Quebec. After 1776, the area was owned by the Americans. On Old Mission peninsula, Rev Peter Doughtery started the first permanent settlement in 1839. This was called \"Grand Traverse\", but was later renamed to Old Mission.\n\n\nBesides cherries, the surrounding countryside produces grapes and is one of the centers of the Michigan wine industry.

Despite significant development in the last decade it is still home to the endangered and endemic purple-faced langur, an usually shy monkey species that can only be found in Sri Lanka's forests. The remnant population in Unawatuna needs to be recognised and the remaining forest cover should be protected to preserve this beautiful creature. This will in turn provide unique opportunities for eco-tourism that will benefit all local communities and stakeholders as well as the environment and ecology.\n\nThe description of the beach paradises in Valmiki's epic Ramayana sounds like Unawatuna.\n\nUnawatuna traces its roots to the great epic Ramayana. In the epic, the monkey-warrior Hanuman was sent back to India to fetch the four medicinal herbs by Jambavan namely, \"mritasanjeevani\", \"vishalyakarani\", \"suvarnakarani\", and \"sandhani\" from the Himalayas in order to heal Lakshman who was wounded trying to save the abducted Princess Sita from the demon king Ravana. Hanuman failed to identify these herbs, so he lifted the entire mountain and carried it to the battlefield to try to save Lakshman, but in the process, a chunk of it \"fell-down\" in the location of the present day Unawatuna, the name of the village derives from \"Una-watuna\" meaning \"fell down\".\n\nCurrently, an edifice is being built in honour of Hanuman on the harbour end of Rumassala Hill by Japanese monks of the Mahayana sect of Buddhism near the Peace Pagoda that they built.\n\nA banished Indian Prince was shipwrecked and the Goddess of Earth, Manimekalai, taking pity created a rocky shelf for him to save his life and that subsequently he headed to Unawatuna. The Goddess of Chastity, Pattini, created a wall of fire to prevent him coming ashore, but being a person of some supreme power, he set in motion a tsunami with his foot to extinguish the fire and set foot on the shores of Unawatuna.\n\nIt is said that he lived in Unawatuna and helped the people in various ways. Over the years he has been venerated and worshiped, and the Kovil (or Devalaya) on the west end point of the bay which has a history of over a thousand years is believed to be the abode of this Devol deity.\n\nIn later years a Buduge, or House of Buddha, and the Swethamalee Chaitiya, or Dagaba, was built on the hillock abutting the Devalaya, or House of Gods. Thousands of pilgrims throng to this place of worship every month of Esala to offer poojas. This festival is a new rice offering so most cultivators bring a share of their crop and pray for timely rain and plentiful harvest. Some others save a fistful of rice from their daily meal and offer that rice, still others would purchase a few measures or even full gunnies of rice along with coconuts to offer.\n\nThis rice is pounded and mixed with coconut milk and treacle and made into a porridge which is then offered to the deities at the devalaya and given as alms to thousands of devotees who will trek to the devalaya for this alms giving or \"Maha Deva Dana\" or \"Kiri Dana\". Fisher folk save and offer part of their earnings called \"Goda kotasa\" seeking protection on their forays into the ocean.\n\nAfter defeating the Portuguese at the Fort of Negombo, the Dutch sailed south and landed on Unawatuna in 1640 and marched to Galle. The Portuguese had encountered the Dutch soldiers at Magalle (where Closenburg Hotel is now located), and fierce fighting took place there. Over 400 Dutch soldiers were killed, and only 49 Portuguese could manage to get back to their fortification in Galle, where they were held in siege for four days before they surrendered.\n\nThe Dutch built houses for their officials in Unawatuna. These constructions include the Nooit Gedacht hotel, Unawatuna Hospital and the mansion Maharambe. UBR hotel is situated on a land called Parangiyawatta, meaning \"land of the Portuguese\", and the area nearby is known as Ja-kotuwa, suggesting that it was the settlement of Ja or Javanese people better known as Hollanders and there may have been some fortification.\n\nThe Galle tower or Edwards Pillar in Rumassala Hill is believed to have been a fake lighthouse built during World War I, and the area is shown as property of the British Admiralty in old survey maps.\n\nUnawatuna is rich in its biodiversity. Its greatest potential attraction for eco-tourism was the marsh land or mangrove, Kadolana, which was partially dredged and filled to develop a hotel for a German hotel chain. The development never eventuated. Many locals believe it to have been cursed for being built at the doorstep of the \"Wella Devalaya\".\n\nOver sixty species of endemic birds, including terns, egrets, herons, sandpipers and kingfishers, as well as rarer species such as the lesser whistling duck, the Asian palm swift, the white-breasted waterhen, the Loten's sunbird and the black bittern have been sighted in the locality by the ornithologist, Clive Byers. These birds are mostly sighted in the remaining marshy area and Rumassala Hillock.\n\nOff the coast of Unawatuna, beneath the Indian Ocean lies a number of coral reefs, shipwrecks, and a great variety of fish and turtles. The turtles still wade onto the shore to lay their nests and eggs, and at times, as if to lay first claim to the sandy shore now invaded by the tourists and dotted by restaurateurs, even go right into the beach front restaurants .\n\nThe Rumassala coral reefs at the east end of the Galle Harbor attract divers, but are now endangered due to possible port development. Eco treks in the shrub jungles of Rumassala are also available.\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami swept away many beach front restaurants and has devastated the sandy beach to a great extent, marring what was once claimed to be one of the twelve best beaches in the world. It is still considered to be one of the best 100 beaches of the world.\n\nThe Department of Coast Conservation was hard pressed to implement a coastal resources management plan under the Asian Development Bank plan, but did not spring into action on the aftermath of the tsunami. The Tourism authorities or Urban Development Authority have not yet taken action in regard to this issue.\n\nBeginning on December 14, 2011, many illegal structures were cleared from the beachfront.\n\nRecent human activities have destroyed almost all the beach lines, a breakwater that was constructed has disrupted the natural flow of the currents and has destroyed the coral reef too.\n\nUnawatuna is located on the Coastal or Southern Rail Line (connecting Colombo through to Matara), and the A2 highway, connecting Colombo to Wellawaya.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was later turned into a popular song with lyrics by Mitchell Parish. Numerous artists have since covered \"Blue Tango\".\n\nAn instrumental version of \"Blue Tango\" recorded by Anderson (Decca Records, catalog number 27875, with the flip side \"Belle of the Ball\") reached number one on the \"Billboard\" chart in 1952. (According to other sources, the Anderson recording first reached the charts on December 29, 1951.) \"Billboard\" ranked it as the number one song of 1952. The same recording was released in 1952 by Brunswick Records (United Kingdom) as catalog number 04870, with the same flip side.\n\nHugo Winterhalter and his orchestra recorded \"Blue Tango\" at Manhattan Center, New York City, on January 22, 1952. It was released by RCA Victor as catalog number 20-4518A, with the flip side \"Gypsy Trail\". This version first reached the \"Billboard\" Best Seller chart on February 29, 1952 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at #8. (Other sources give the first date on the charts as March 8, 1952, and the highest position as #6.) It was also released in Great Britain by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10277.\n\nLes Baxter and his orchestra released a version of \"Blue Tango\" by Capitol Records as catalog number 1681, with the flip side \"Because of You\". This version first reached the \"Billboard\" Best Seller chart on March 14, 1952 and lasted 9 weeks on the chart, peaking at #22. (Other sources give the first date on the charts as March 15, 1952, and the highest position as #10.) This version was also released by Capitol Records in the United States as catalog number 1966, in Australia as catalog number CP-117 and in the United Kingdom as catalog number CL 13703, all with the flip side \"Please Mr. Sun\".\n\nA recording of the song by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians was released by Decca Records as catalog number 28031, with the flip side \"At Last, At Last\". This version first reached the \"Billboard\" Best Seller chart on April 11, 1952 and lasted 10 weeks on the chart, peaking at #16.\n\nA vocal version was recorded by Alma Cogan in the United Kingdom in 1952. The song was also featured on the first UK Singles Chart the same year in another instrumental recording by orchestra leader Ray Martin.\n\nThe song was subsequently revived by Bill Black's Combo. This recording was released by Hi Records as catalog number 2027, with the flip side \"Willie\". It first reached the \"Billboard\" charts on December 12, 1960 and lasted 7 weeks on the chart. On the composite chart of the top 100 songs, it reached #16. This version (with the same flip side) was also released in Australia by London Records, as catalog number HL-1735.\n\nAnderson originally wrote \"Blue Tango\" for an orchestra consisting of two flutes, one piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets in B-Flat, two bassoons; four horns in F, three trumpets in B-Flat, two tenor trombones, bass trombone, tuba; a percussion section consisting of snare drum, bass drum and glockenspiel; and strings.\n\nFrench singer Amanda Lear recorded her own version of \"Blue Tango\", providing it with self-penned lyrics. The recording was included on her debut 1977 album \"I Am a Photograph\" and released as a 7\" single in the Netherlands and Russia. The single was not a commercial success and did not chart.\n\nThe music video referenced rumours on her alleged transsexualism, which circulated in media at that time. The clip opens with Lear wearing a mannish attire, a black tie and a bowler hat. The singer then \"transforms\" herself into a woman, taking the costume off and revealing a long bright dress. The video was first aired in Italian TV show \"Odeon\" on 18 October 1977.\n\nAnother music video was produced for a popular German TV show \"Musikladen\". It pictures the singer sat at the table while performing the song and smoking a cigarette. In 1982, another video for \"Blue Tango\" was released for Italian TV show \"Premiatissima\", which Lear hosted at that time. The singer is pictured wearing a flamenco dress and repeating dance routines accompanied by male dancers. The video premiered on 25 December 1982 and was later included in Lear's Italian television special \"Ma chi è Amanda?\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1950097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950097", "title": "Race stage", "text": "Race stage\n\nIn sports, a stage, or leg, or heat, is a unit of a race which has been divided in several parts for the reason such as length of the distance to be covered, as in a multi-day event. Usually, such a race consists of \"ordinary\" stages, but sometimes stages are held as an individual time trial or a team time trial. Long races such as the Tour de France, Absa Cape Epic or the Giro d'Italia are known for their stages of one day each, whereas the boat sailing Velux 5 Oceans Race is broken down in usually four stages of several weeks duration each, where the competitors are racing continuously day and night. In bicycling and running events, a race with stages is known as a stage race.\n\nIn an ordinary stage of road bicycle racing, all riders start simultaneously and share the road. Riders are permitted to touch and to shelter behind each other. Riding in each other's slipstreams is crucial to race tactics: a lone rider has little chance of outracing a small group of riders who can take turns in the strenuous position at the front of the group. The majority of riders form a single large group, the \"pack\" (in French, the \"peloton\"), with attacking groups ahead of it and the occasional struggling rider dropping behind. In mountainous stages the peloton is likely to become fragmented, but in flat stages a split is rare.\n\nWhere a group of riders reach the finish line together, they do not race each other for a few seconds of improvement to their finishing time. There is a rule that if one rider finishes less than three seconds behind another then he is credited with the same finishing time as the first. This operates transitively, so when the peloton finishes together every rider in it gets the time of the rider at the front of the peloton, even though the peloton takes tens of seconds, and possibly even a couple of minutes, to cross the finish line.\n\nRiders who crash within the last three kilometres of the stage are credited with the finishing time of the group that they were with when they crashed, if that is better than the time in which they actually finish. This avoids sprinters being penalized for accidents that do not accurately reflect their performance on the stage as a whole given that crashes in the final three kilometre can be huge pileups that are hard to avoid for a rider farther back in the peloton. A crashed sprinter inside the final three kilometres will not win the sprint, but avoids being penalised in the overall classification.\n\nOrdinary stages can be further classified as \"sprinters' stages\" or \"climbers' stages\". The former tend to be raced on relatively flat terrain, which makes it difficult for small groups or individual cyclists to break away from the peloton—there are no big hills to slow it down. So more often than not, the entire peloton approaches the finish line en masse. Some teams are organized around a single specialized sprinter, and in the final kilometres of a sprint stage, these teams jockey for position at the front of the peloton. In the final few hundred metres, a succession of riders \"lead out\" their sprinter, riding very hard while he stays in their slipstream. Just before the line—200 metres away is about the maximum—the sprinter launches himself around his final lead-out man in an all-out effort for the line. Top speeds can be in excess of 72 km/h (about 45 mph). Sprint stages rarely result in big time differences between riders (see above), but contenders for the General Classification tend to stay near the front of the peloton to avoid crashes.\n\nMountain stages, on the other hand, often do cause big \"splits\" in the finishing times, especially when the stage actually ends at the top of a mountain. (If the stage ends at the bottom of a mountain that has just been climbed, riders have the chance to descend aggressively and catch up to anyone who may have beaten them to the summit.) For this reason, the mountain stages are considered the deciding factor in most Tours, and are often attended by hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nMountains cause big splits in finishing times due to the simple laws of physics. Firstly, the slower speeds mean that the aerodynamic advantage gained by slipstreaming is much smaller. Furthermore, lighter riders generate more power per kilogram than heavier riders; thus, the sprinters and the rouleurs (all-around good cyclists), who tend to be a bit bigger, suffer on the climbs and lose much time—40 minutes over a long stage is not unheard-of. Generally, these riders form a group known as the \"bus\" or \"autobus\" and ride at a steady pace to the finish. Their only goal is to cross the line within a certain limit—usually the stage winner's time plus 15% -- or else they'll be disqualified from the race (at the discretion of the officials; on rare occasions a lead breakaway becomes so large that the entire peloton falls that far back and would normally be allowed to remain in the competition to avoid having only a small field still in competition).\nMeanwhile, the lighter climbers hurl themselves up the slopes at a much higher speed. Usually, the General Classification riders try to stay near the front group, and also try to keep a few teammates with them. These teammates are there to drive the pace—and hopefully \"drop\" the opposition riders—and to provide moral support to their leader. Typically, the leader will attack very hard when there are only a few kilometres to go, trying to put time into his main rivals. Gaps of two and even three minutes can be created over just a few kilometres by hard attacks.\n\nIn larger stage races, some stages may be designated as \"medium mountain\", \"hilly\" or \"intermediate\" stages. These stages are more difficult than flat stages, but not as difficult as the mountain stages. They are often well-suited for a breakaway (as described below). Occasionally, the distinction between medium mountain and mountain in stage classification, decided by race officials, can be controversial. The Giro d'Italia has had a reputation of labeling selective, very difficult stages as merely medium mountain.\n\nLastly, a handful of stages each year are known as being \"good for a breakaway\"—when one or a few riders attacks the peloton and beats it to the finish line. Typically these stages are somewhere between flat and mountainous. Breakaway stages are where the rouleurs, the hard-working, all-around riders who make up the majority of most teams, get their chance to grab a moment in the spotlight. (The climbers will want to save their energy for the mountains, and the sprinters are not built for hills.)\n\nIn the big multi-day events like the Tour or the Giro, there is a secondary competition on points (e.g. Points classification in the Tour de France), which tends to be contested by sprinters. Riders collect points for being one of the first to finish the stage and also for being one of the first three to finish an \"intermediate\" sprint. Sprinters also can get time bonuses, meaning that good sprinters may lead the general classification during the first few stages of a big multi-day event.\n\nIn NASCAR racing, starting with the 2017 season, races in the top three national touring series are completed in three stages, four in the case of the NASCAR Cup Series’s longest race, the Coca-Cola 600. A stage consists of normal green flag racing followed by a stoppage on a designated lap signified by the waving of a green and white checkered flag, then a yellow flag. The top-10 finishers in each of the first two stages are awarded bonus championship points. The points earned are added to a driver/owner's regular season points total, while the winner of the stage receives an additional point that can be carried into the NASCAR playoffs. The stage lengths vary by track, but the first two stages usually combine to equal about half of the race. The final stage (which still pays out the most championship points) usually equals the other half. The first driver to win a National Series race under the stage race format was Camping World Truck Series driver Kaz Grala who won the season opener at Daytona International Speedway in February 2017.\n\nRound-the-world sailing races are sometimes held over stages. Notable examples are the Volvo Ocean Race, Velux 5 Oceans Race, Clipper Round the World Yacht Race and Global Challenge.\n"}

{"id": "1950121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950121", "title": "Great hammerhead", "text": "Great hammerhead\n\nThe great hammerhead (\"Sphyrna mokarran\") is the largest species of hammerhead shark, belonging to the family Sphyrnidae, attaining a maximum length of . It is found in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, inhabiting coastal areas and the continental shelf. The great hammerhead can be distinguished from other hammerheads by the shape of its \"hammer\" (called the \"cephalofoil\"), which is wide with an almost straight front margin, and by its tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. A solitary, strong-swimming apex predator, the great hammerhead feeds on a wide variety of prey ranging from crustaceans and cephalopods, to bony fish, to smaller sharks. Observations of this species in the wild suggest that the cephalofoil functions to immobilize stingrays, a favored prey. This species has a viviparous mode of reproduction, bearing litters of up to 55 pups every two years.\n\nAlthough potentially dangerous, the great hammerhead rarely attacks humans. It sometimes behaves inquisitively toward divers and should be treated with respect. This shark is heavily fished for its large fins, which are extremely valuable on the Asian market as the main ingredient of shark fin soup. As a result, great hammerhead populations are declining substantially worldwide, and it has been assessed as Endangered and change to Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nThe great hammerhead was first described as \"Zygaena mokarran\" in 1837 by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell. The name was later changed to the current \"Sphyrna mokarran\". However, for many years the valid scientific name for the great hammerhead was thought to be \"Sphyrna tudes\", which was coined in 1822 by Achille Valenciennes. In 1950, Enrico Tortonese determined that the specimens illustrated by Valenciennes were in fact smalleye hammerheads, to which the name \"S. tudes\" then applied. As the next most senior synonym, \"Sphyrna mokarran\" became the great hammerhead's valid name. The lectotype for this species is a long male from the Red Sea.\n\nOlder studies based on morphology have generally placed the great hammerhead as one of the more derived members of its family, reflecting the traditional view that cephalofoil size gradually increased over the course of hammerhead shark evolution. However, this view has been refuted by phylogenetic analyses using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which found that the great hammerhead and the smooth hammerhead (\"S. zygaena\") form a clade that is basal to all other \"Sphyrna\" species. These results also show that the first hammerheads to evolve had large rather than small cephalofoils.\n\nThe great hammerhead inhabits tropical waters around the world, between the latitudes of 40°N and 37°S. In the Atlantic Ocean, it is found from North Carolina to Uruguay, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and from Morocco to Senegal, and the Mediterranean Sea. It is found all along the rim of the Indian Ocean, and in the Pacific Ocean from the Ryukyu Islands to Australia, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia, and from southern Baja California to Peru. It may occur off Gambia, Guinea, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, and Western Sahara, but this has not been confirmed. Great hammerheads may be found from inshore waters of less than deep, to a depth of offshore. They favor coral reefs, but also inhabit continental shelves, island terraces, lagoons, and deep water near land. They are migratory; populations off Florida and in the South China Sea have been documented moving closer to the poles in the summer.\n\nThe streamlined body of the great hammerhead with the expanded cephalofoil is typical of the hammerhead sharks. Adult great hammerheads can be distinguished from the scalloped hammerhead and the smooth hammerhead by the shape of the cephalofoil, which has a nearly straight front margin (as opposed to arched), with prominent medial and lateral indentations. The width of the cephalofoil is 23–27% of the body length. The teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, becoming more oblique towards the corners of the mouth. There are 17 tooth rows on either side of the upper jaw with 2–3 teeth at the symphysis (the midline of the jaw), and 16–17 teeth on either side of the lower jaw and 1–3 at the symphysis.\n\nThe first dorsal fin is distinctive, being very tall and strongly falcate (sickle-shaped), and originates over the insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin and anal fin are both relatively large, with deep notches in the rear margins. The pelvic fins are falcate with concave rear margins, in contrast to the straight-margined pelvic fins of the scalloped hammerhead. The skin is covered with closely placed dermal denticles. Each denticle is diamond-shaped, with 3–5 horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth in smaller individuals, and 5–6 in larger ones. The great hammerhead is dark brown to light gray to olive above, fading to white on the underside. The fins are unmarked in adults, while the tip of the second dorsal fin may be dark in juveniles.\n\nThe average great hammerhead measures up to long and weighs over . A small percentage of the population, mostly or all females, are much larger. The longest great hammerhead on record was . The heaviest known great hammerhead is a long, female caught off Boca Grande, Florida in 2006. The weight of the female was due to her being pregnant with 55 near-natal pups.\n\nThe great hammerhead is a solitary, nomadic predator that tends to be given a wide berth by other reef sharks. If confronted, they may respond with an agonistic display: dropping their pectoral fins and swimming in a stiff or jerky fashion. Juveniles are preyed upon by larger sharks such as bull sharks (\"Carcharhinus leucas\"), while adults have no major predators except for killer whales, who hunt hammerheads of any age. Yellow jacks (\"Carangoides bartholomaei\") have been seen rubbing themselves against the hammerhead's flanks, possibly to rid themselves of parasites. Schools of pilot fish (\"Naucrates ductor\") sometimes accompany the great hammerhead. The great hammerhead is parasitized by several species of copepods, including \"Alebion carchariae\", \"A. elegans\", \"Nesippus orientalis\", \"N. crypturus\", \"Eudactylina pollex\", \"Kroyeria gemursa\", and \"Nemesis atlantica\".\n\nThe great hammerhead shark is an active predator with a varied diet, known prey of the great hammerhead include invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters, squid, and octopus, bony fishes such as tarpon, sardines, sea catfishes, toadfish, porgies, grunts, jacks, croakers, groupers, flatfishes, boxfishes, and porcupine fishes, and smaller sharks such as smoothhounds. At Rangiroa Atoll, great hammerheads prey opportunistically on grey reef sharks (\"Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos\") that have exhausted themselves pursuing mates. The species is known to be cannibalistic.\n\nGreat hammerheads are apex predators among sharks and are specialists at feeding on other sharks, rays and skates, especially stingrays . The venomous spines of stingrays are frequently found lodged inside its mouth and do not seem to bother the shark as one specimen caught off Florida had 96 spines in and around its mouth. Great hammerheads primarily hunt at dawn or dusk, swinging their heads in broad angles over the sea floor so as to pick up the electrical signatures of stingrays buried in the sand, via numerous electroreceptory located on the underside of the cephalofoil. The cephalofoil also serves as a hydrofoil that allows the shark to quickly turn around and strike at a ray once detected. Off Florida, large hammerheads are often the first to reach newly baited sharklines, suggesting a particularly keen sense of smell.\n\nAnother function of the cephalofoil is suggested by an observation of a great hammerhead attacking a southern stingray (\"Dasyatis americana\") in the Bahamas: the shark first knocked the ray to the sea bottom with a powerful blow from above, and then pinned it with its head while pivoting to take a large bite from each side of the ray's pectoral fin disc. This effectively crippled the stingray, which was then picked up in the jaws and sawed apart with rapid shakes of the head. A great hammerhead has also been seen attacking a spotted eagle ray (\"Aetobatus narinari\") in open water by taking a massive bite out of one of its pectoral fins. The ray thus incapacitated, the shark once again used its head to pin it to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws head-first. These observations suggest that the great hammerhead seeks to disable rays with the first bite, a strategy similar to that of the great white shark (\"Carcharodon carcharias\"), and that its cephalofoil is an adaptation for prey handling.\n\nA 2016 study of specimens logged with accelerometers showed that great hammerhead sharks reduce drag and lessen energy expenditure by swimming on their side in a posture termed \"rolled swimming\". The shark uses its very large dorsal fin to help achieve lift, a habit that had previously been noted in captive specimens, and may spend up to 90% of its time in this swimming orientation. The technique is thought to save ~10% in drag and consequently movement costs.\n\nAs with other hammerhead sharks, great hammerheads are viviparous: once the developing young use up their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is transformed into a structure analogous to a mammalian placenta. Unlike most other sharks, which mate on or near the sea bottom, great hammerheads have been observed mating near the surface. In one account from the Bahamas, a mating pair ascended while swimming around each other, mating when they reached the surface. Females breed once every two years, giving birth from late spring to summer in the Northern Hemisphere and from December to January in Australian waters. The gestation period is 11 months. The litter size ranges from 6–55 pups, with 20–40 being typical. The young measure at birth; males reach maturity at long and and the females at and . The young differ from the adults in having a rounded frontal margin on the head. The typical lifespan of this species is 20–30 years; the record Boca Grande female was estimated to be 40–50 years old.\n\nWith its large size and cutting teeth, the great hammerhead could seriously injure a human and caution should be exercised around them. This species has a (possibly undeserved) reputation for aggression and being the most dangerous of the hammerhead sharks. Divers underwater have reported that great hammerheads tend to be shy or nonreactive toward humans. However, there have been reports of great hammerheads approaching divers closely and even charging them when they first enter the water. As of 2011, the International Shark Attack File lists 34 bites, 17 of them unprovoked and none fatal, attributable to hammerhead sharks of the genus \"Sphyrna\". Due to the difficulty in identifying the species involved, it is uncertain how many were caused by great hammerheads. This shark has been confirmed to be responsible for only one (provoked) bite.\n\nThe great hammerhead is regularly caught both commercially and recreationally in the tropics, using longlines, fixed bottom nets, hook-and-line, and trawls. Though the meat is rarely consumed, their fins are becoming increasing valuable due to the Asian demand for shark fin soup. In addition, their skin used for leather, their liver oil for vitamins, and their carcasses for fishmeal. The great hammerhead is also taken unintentionally as bycatch and suffers very high mortality, over 90% for fisheries in the northwest Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Entanglement in shark nets around Australian and South African beaches is another source of mortality.\n\nFeeding of the great hammerhead occurs within the Bahama Islands - helping generate over $100 Million of tourism income each year and ensuring sharks are protected in the waters around the islands. \nThe great hammerhead is extremely vulnerable to overfishing due to its low overall abundance and long generation time. Assessment of its conservation status is difficult as few fisheries separate the great hammerhead from other hammerheads in their reported catches. This species is listed as globally Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is Endangered in the northwestern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, where though it is a non-targeted species, populations have dropped 50% since the 1990s due to bycatch. It is also Endangered in the southwestern Indian Ocean, where large numbers of longline vessels operate illegally along the coasts for hammerheads and the giant guitarfish (\"Rhynchobatus djiddensis\"). The great hammerhead catch rate in Indian Ocean has declined 73% from 1978 to 2003, though it is yet undetermined whether these represent localized or widespread depletion. The great hammerhead is Critically Endangered along the western coast of Africa, where stocks have collapsed with an estimated 80% decline in the past 25 years. The West African Sub-Regional Fishing Commission (SRFC) has recognized the great hammerhead as one of the four most threatened species in the region, though fishing continues unmonitored and unregulated. Off northern Australia, this species was assessed as Data Deficient but at \"high risk\". Concern has arisen there over a substantial increase in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, reflecting the rising value of this shark's fins.\n\nNo conservation measures specifically protecting the great hammerhead have been enacted. It is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, though no management schemes have yet been implemented under this agreement. The banning of shark finning by countries and supranational entities such as United States, Australia, and the European Union, and international regulatory bodies such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), should reduce fishing pressure on the great hammerhead.\n\n"}

A rhythm and blues version was also recorded that year, by Wini Brown and her Boy Friends. Mario Lanza, at the height of his popularity in the early 1950, had also planned to record this song, but changed his mind when asked not to by Martino, so his recording would not be overlooked.\n\nIn 1961, Martino re-recorded the song, although it only reached number 86 on the Billboard Top 100 chart (Top 20 on their \"Easy Listening\" survey).

It is part of what New Testament scholars have called the 'farewell discourse' of Jesus. It has historically been a source of Christian teaching, Christological debate and reflection, and its images (particularly of Jesus as the vine) have been influential in Christian art and iconography. The chapter implies one of the highest and most developed Christologies to be found in the New Testament. The original text was written in Koine Greek.\n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 27 verses.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n\nThe events and discourses recorded in this chapter and in the whole of chapters 13 to 17 took place in Jerusalem. The precise location is not specified, but states that afterwards, \"Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley\". Because the previous chapter ends with the words \"Come now, let us go\", Plummer, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, suggests that Jesus and His disciples have \"rise[n] from table and prepare[d] to depart, but that the contents of the next three chapters (15-17) are spoken before they leave the room\".\n\nThe chapter presents Jesus speaking in the first person. Although ostensibly addressing his disciples, most scholars conclude the chapter is written with events concerning the later church in mind. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers - seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with his Father.\n\nThe chapter introduces the extended metaphor of Christ as the true vine. The Father is the vinedresser, vinegrower or husbandman. His disciples are said to be branches (, \"ta klémata\", specifically meaning \"vine\" branches) which must 'abide' in him if they are to 'bear fruit'. The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser: see : Every branch that does bear fruit is pruned so that it will bear more fruit - not barren branches.\n\nThe chapter proceeds by comparing the close relationship of Jesus and his disciples ('abiding') to that of himself and his Father. Disciples are reminded of the love of the Father and the Son - the love of the Son for the disciples, and then indicted to 'love one another' in the same manner. Verse 13 speaks of the 'greater love' as being the willingness to 'lay down' one's life for friends. This text, which primarily refers to Jesus’ impending death, has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of martyrs and soldiers in war, and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.\n\nJesus then speaks of being hated by the world (verses 18-25), but He sees this hatred as fulfillment of the words in either Psalm 69, \"They hated Me without a cause\". or Psalm 35, \"neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause\".\n\nThe chapter concludes by warning disciples to expect persecution and promises the gift of the \"parakletos\" (paraclete or Holy Spirit). The reference to the Spirit in verse 26, speaks of it as sent by the Son from the Father. This verse has been particularly influential in debates concerning the nature of the Trinity and in the filioque disputes between Eastern and Western Christianity.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1950152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950152", "title": "Ship of Fools (Porter novel)", "text": "Ship of Fools (Porter novel)\n\nShip of Fools is a 1962 novel by Katherine Anne Porter, telling the tale of a group of disparate characters sailing from Mexico to Europe aboard a German passenger ship. The large cast of characters includes Germans, a Swiss family, Mexicans, Americans, Spaniards, a group of Cuban medical students, and a Swede. In steerage, there are 876 Spanish workers being returned from Cuba. It is an allegory tracing the rise of Nazism and looks metaphorically at the progress of the world on its \"voyage to eternity\".\n\nPorter had been widely praised for her short stories, mostly written between 1922 and 1940. She began work on the novel in 1940, intending it initially to be a novella (or \"short novel\", as Porter would put it, as she famously wrote about how she detested the word \"novella\"). The story was based on a journal she kept in 1931 during a sea voyage from Veracruz, Mexico, on her way to study in Bremerhaven, Germany, on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the characters in the novel were based on real people she met during the trip. The title was taken from \"Das Narrenschiff\" (\"The Fool-Ship\"), a 15th-century German poem by Sebastian Brant.\n\nFor many years, the initial publisher Harcourt Brace would announce the forthcoming novel, but she remained unable to complete it for 22 years. As a result, it became eagerly expected by the literary world. In response to critics who complained about the long wait, Porter said, \"Look here, this is my life and my work and you keep out of it. When I have a book I will be glad to have it published.\"\n\n\"Ship of Fools\" first appeared in the Autumn 1959 edition of Texas Quarterly journal (54 pgs).\n\"Ship of Fools\" outsold every other American novel published in 1962. It was a Book of the Month Club selection and immediately, the film rights were sold for $500,000 ($ adjusted for inflation).\n\nCritical reception was mixed. While Mark Schorer of \"The New York Times\" and Glenway Wescott in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" were effusive in their praise, Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New Republic\" and Granville Hicks in the \"Saturday Review\" were disappointed. Porter herself was never satisfied with the novel, calling it \"unwieldy\" and \"enormous\".\n\nThe critic Elizabeth Hardwick had this to say about \"Ship of Fools\": \"All is too static and the implied parable is never quite achieved. There is something a little musty, like old yellowing notes. The flawless execution of the single scenes impresses and yet the novel remains too snug and shipshape for the waters of history.\"\n\nThe 1965 film was adapted by Abby Mann from the novel and was directed by Stanley Kramer. It won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Robert Clatworthy, Joseph Kish) and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White. Porter's first reaction to the film adaptation was that Mann had omitted too much from the book, distorting its message. It was also noteworthy for being the last film to feature the actress Vivien Leigh.\n\nThe theme of the novel is the passengers' unavailing withdrawal from a life of disappointment, seeking a kind of utopia, and, \"without knowing what to do next\", setting out for a long voyage to pre–World War II Europe, a world of prejudice, racism and evil. Mrs. Treadwell, a nostalgic American divorcee, hopes to find happiness in Paris, where she once spent her youth. Elsa Lutz, the plain daughter of a Swiss hotelkeeper, thinks heaven might be in the Isle of Wight. Jenny, an artist, says the most dangerous and happiest moment in her life was when she was swimming alone in the Gulf of Mexico, confronted with a school of dolphins. And at the end of the novel, one of the ship's musicians, a gangly starving boy, feels overjoyed to finally be off the ship and back in his home country, as if Germany were a \"human being, a good and dear trusted friend who had come a long way to welcome him\". Thus Porter manages to convey that salvation is reality, and evil can be overcome.\n\n"}

{"id": "1950192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950192", "title": "Máirtín Ó Cadhain", "text": "Máirtín Ó Cadhain\n\nMáirtín Ó Cadhain (; 1906 – 18 October 1970) was one of the most prominent Irish language writers of the twentieth century. Perhaps best known for his 1949 work \"Cré na Cille\", Ó Cadhain played a key role in bringing literary modernism to contemporary Irish language literature. Politically, he was an Irish nationalist and socialist, promoting the \"Athghabháil na hÉireann\" (\"Re-Conquest of Ireland\"), through Gaelic culture. He was a member of the post-Civil War Irish Republican Army with Brendan Behan during the Emergency.\n\nBorn in Connemara, he became a schoolteacher but was dismissed due to his IRA membership. In the 1930s he served as an IRA recruiting officer, enlisting fellow writer Brendan Behan. During this period, he also participated in the land campaign of native speakers, which led to the establishment of the Ráth Cairn neo-Gaeltacht in County Meath. Subsequently, he was arrested and interned during the Emergency years on the Curragh Camp in County Kildare, due to his continued involvement in the violent activities of the Irish Republican Army.\n\nÓ Cadhain's politics were a nationalist mix of Marxism and social radicalism tempered with a rhetorical anti-clericalism. In his writings concerning the future of the Irish language he was however practical about the position of the Church as a social and societal institution, craving rather for a wholehearted commitment to the language cause even among Catholic churchmen. It was his view that, as the Church was there anyway, it would be better if it were more willing to address the Faithful in the national idiom.\n\nAs a writer, Ó Cadhain is acknowledged to be a pioneer of Irish-language modernism. His Irish was the dialect of Connemara – indeed, he is often accused of an unnecessarily dialectal usage in grammar and orthography even in contexts where realistic depiction of Connemara dialect was not called for – but he was happy to cannibalise other dialects, classical literature and even Scots Gaelic for the sake of linguistic and stylistic enrichment of his own writings. Consequently, much of what he wrote is reputedly hard to read for a non-native speaker. \n\nHe was a prolific writer of short stories. His collections of short stories include \"Cois Caoláire\", \"An Braon Broghach\", \"Idir Shúgradh agus Dháiríre\", \"An tSraith Dhá Tógáil\", \"An tSraith Tógtha\" and \"An tSraith ar Lár\". He also wrote three novels, of which only \"Cré na Cille\" was published during his lifetime. The other two, \"Athnuachan\" and \"Barbed Wire\", appeared in print only recently. He translated Charles Kickham's novel \"Sally Kavanagh\" into Irish as \"Saile Chaomhánach, nó na hUaigheanna Folmha\". He also wrote several political or linguo-political pamphlets. His political views can most easily be discerned in a small book about the development of Irish nationalism and radicalism since Theobald Wolfe Tone, \"Tone Inné agus Inniu\"; and in the beginning of the sixties, he wrote – partly in Irish, partly in English – a comprehensive survey of the social status and actual use of the language in the west of Ireland, published as \"An Ghaeilge Bheo – Destined to Pass\". In August 1969 he delivered a speech (published as \"Gluaiseacht na Gaeilge: Gluaiseacht ar Strae\") in which he spoke of the role Irish speakers should take in 'Athghabháil na hÉireann', or the Re-Conquest of Ireland as James Connolly first coined the term.\n\nHe and Diarmaid Ó Súilleabháin were considered the two most innovative Irish language authors to emerge in the 1960s. He had frequent difficulties getting his work edited, but unpublished writings have appeared at least every two years since the publication of Athnuachan in the mid-nineties.\n\nA lecture hall in Trinity College Dublin is named after Ó Cadhain who was professor of Irish. A bronze bust is also located in the Irish department.\n\nÓ Cadhain's interest in Irish Republicanism after he started reading An Phoblacht, a Republican newspaper with strong links to the Irish Republican Army that contained articles in both English and Irish. While living in Camus, County Galway (an Irish speaking village of the Gaeltacht) he resided with Seosamh Mac Mathúna, who had been a member of the IRA since 1918. His time with Mac Mathúna further brought him down the path of Republican and eventually, Mac Mathúna made O Cadhian a member of the IRA. As a member, he championed a Marxist analysis of Ireland and was particularly an advocate for \"Athghabháil na hÉireann\" (English: \"The Reconquest of Ireland\"), a term/idea created by James Connolly that suggests the Irish language could only be saved by socialism, as the English language was/is a tool of bourgeois capitalists. \n\nIn 1932 Ó Cadhain along with Mac Mathúna and Críostóir Mac Aonghusa (a local teacher, activist and county councillor) founded Cumann na Gaedhealtachta (The Gaeltacht Association), a pressure group to lobby on behalf of those living in Ireland's Gaeltacht areas. He formed a similar group in 1936 called Muinntir na Gaedhealtachta (the Gaeltacht people). One of the successes of these groups was the establishment of the Ráth Chairn Gaeltacht, in which a new Irish speaking community was created in County Meath. Ó Cadhain had argued the only way by which Irish language speakers could thrive was if efforts to promote the language was coupled with giving Irish speakers good land to work, so as to give them an opportunity at economic success as well. \n\nIn 1936 Ó Cadhain had been working as a school teacher in Carnmore, County Galway for 4 years when he was dismissed from his post by the Bishop of Galway for his Republican beliefs, which were deemed to be \"subversive\". He had also recently attended a march in Kildare to honour his idol Wolfe Tone, a march that had been ruled illegal by the government. He subsequently moved to Dublin where he acted as a recruiter for the IRA, at which he was quite successful. In April 1938 he was appointed to the IRA's Army Council and became their secretary. By 1939 he was \"on the run\" from the Irish authorities and by September of the year had been arrested and imprisoned until December. Ó Cadhain's stint with the Army Council was short-lived however; he resigned in protest of the S-Plan, a sabotage campaign against the British state during World War II, the grounds that any attempt to \"liberate\" Northern Ireland politically was meaningless unless the people were also \"economically liberated\". \n\nIn 1940 he gave an oration at the funeral of his friend Tony Darcy, who had died on hunger strike in Mountjoy Prison seeking political prisoner status. Following the funeral he was once again arrested and imprisoned once again, this time to spend 4 years with hundreds of other IRA members in the Curragh. Ó Cadhain's friend Tomás Bairéad campaigned for his release and they found success on 26 July 1944 when Ó Cadhain was allowed to leave. During Ó Cadhain's time in the Curragh, he taught many of the other prisoners the Irish language. \n\nFollowing his time in the Curragh, Ó Cadhain pulled back from politics to focus on his writing. For a long period he became bitter about Irish Republicanism, but by the 1960s once again identified with its outlook. At the onset of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, he welcomed resistance to British rule as well as the idea of an armed struggle, and once again stated his Marxist outlook on the situation: \"capitalism must go as well as the Border\". \n\nDuring the 1960s he once again threw himself into campaigning on behalf of the Irish language, this time with the group Misneach (\"Courage\"). The group resisted efforts by reform groups to no longer make it compulsory for a student to pass an Irish examination to receive a Leaving Certificate, as well as a requirement that those seeking employment in the public sector needed to be able to speak Irish. Misneach used civil disobedience tactics influenced by Saunders Lewis, the Welsh language advocate and founder of Plaid Cymru.\n\nÓ Cadhain was a key figure in the 1969 civil rights movement, Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta. \n\nHe died on 18 October 1970 in Dublin and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1950194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950194", "title": "Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (Bach)", "text": "Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (Bach)\n\nThe sonatas and partitas for solo violin (BWV 1001–1006) are a set of six works composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. They are sometimes referred to in English as the sonatas and for solo violin in accordance with Bach's headings in the autograph manuscript: \"Partia\" (plural \"Partien\") was commonly used in German-speaking regions during Bach's time, whereas the Italian \"partita\" was introduced to this set in the 1879 Bach Gesellschaft edition, having become standard by that time. The set consists of three sonatas da chiesa in four movements and three partitas (or partias) in dance-form movements. The 2nd Partita is widely known for its Chaconne, considered one of the most masterful and expressive works ever written for solo violin.\n\nThe set was completed by 1720 but was not published until 1802 by Nikolaus Simrock in Bonn. Even after publication, it was largely ignored until the celebrated violinist Joseph Joachim started performing these works. Today, Bach's \"Sonatas and Partitas\" are an essential part of the violin repertoire, and they are frequently performed and recorded.\n\nThe \"Sei Solo a Violino senza Basso accompagnato\" (\"Six Solos for Violin Without Bass Accompaniment\"), as Bach titled them, firmly established the technical capability of the violin as a solo instrument. The pieces often served as archetypes for solo violin pieces by later generations of composers, including Eugène Ysaÿe and Béla Bartók. \n\nSome believe the literal meaning of the title \"sei solo\" when read as German rather than Italian words (\"Be alone\" [imperative]) is an intentional reference to the recent sudden death of his wife. This theory is popular among musicians but not among Bach scholars, though the exceptional indication of the year of completion on the title page does seem to indicate a payment of homage to his wife.\n\nThe surviving autograph manuscript of the sonatas and partitas was made by Bach in 1720 in Köthen, where he was Kapellmeister. As comments, the paucity of sources for instrumental compositions prior to Bach's period in Leipzig makes it difficult to establish a precise chronology; nevertheless, a copy made by the Weimar organist Johann Gottfried Walther in 1714 of the Fugue in G minor for violin and continuo, BWV 1026, which has violinistic writing similar to that in BWV 1001–1006, provides support for the commonly held view that the collection could have been reworked from pieces originally composed in Weimar. The goal of producing a polyphonic texture governed by the rules of counterpoint also indicates the influence of the first surviving works of this kind for solo violin, Johann Paul von Westhoff's \"partitas for solo violin\" composed in 1696. The virtuoso violinist Westhoff served as court musician in Dresden from 1674 to 1697 and in Weimar from 1699 until his death in 1705, so Bach would have known him for two years. The repertoire for solo violin was actively growing at the time: Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber's celebrated solo passacaglia appeared c.1676; Westhoff's collections of solo violin music were published in 1682 and 1696; Johann Joseph Vilsmayr's \"Artificiosus Concentus pro Camera\" in 1715, and Johann Georg Pisendel's solo violin sonata was composed around 1716; and finally, Georg Philipp Telemann published \"12 Fantasias for solo violin\" in 1735.\nThe tradition of polyphonic violin writing was already well-developed in Germany, particularly by Biber, Johann Heinrich Schmelzer, and the composers of the so-called Dresden school – Johann Jakob Walther and Westhoff. Bach's Weimar and Cöthen periods were particularly suitable times for composition of secular music, for he worked as a court musician. Bach's cello and orchestral suites date from the Cöthen period, as well as the famous \"Brandenburg Concertos\" and many other well-known collections of instrumental music. In the list of Bach's chamber works, the violin solos form part of a small group, as there is the supposed 'libro secundo' of the 6 suites à Violoncello solo, with a single partita for flauto traverso solo, in A minor, placed directly after the cello suites in the Schmieder catalogue: BWV 1013. So there exist in all 13 varied sonatas and partitas in the 'senza Basso' group. In both major manuscripts the important specification is written clearly: for violin/violoncello solo, 'senza Basso accompagnato'. Bach himself underwrote the practice of Basso Continuo as the Fundament of Music, which was the common denominator in all artistic music in his time. A solo sonata for violin would naturally have the continuo players and parts implied, here Bach himself tells us that Basso Continuo does not apply. The norm was set by Corelli's important solo sonatas of 1700 (op. 5) which may have been accompanied in a variety of ways, but here the Basso Continuo is the natural accompaniment to the 'solo' violin. Written is the bass line, with numbers and incidentals to point to desired harmonies that are to be worked out by the harpsichordist or lute player, to which a low register bowed or blown instrument can be added to double the left hand bass line. This was a given, the 'senza Basso' pieces are the exception in that they challenge the player to realise various layers wherein some notes and patterns are the accompaniment of other parts, so that a polyphonic discourse is written into the music. Arpeggios over several strings, multiple stopping and opposing tonal ranges and particularly very deft bowing are exploited to the full to make all the voices speak from one bow and four strings, or five, or from a single flute.\n\nIt is not known whether these violin solos were performed during Bach's lifetime or, if they were, who the performer was. Johann Georg Pisendel and Jean-Baptiste Volumier, both talented violinists in the Dresden court, have been suggested as possible performers, as was Joseph Spiess, leader of the orchestra in Köthen. Friedrich Wilhelm Rust, who would later become part of the Bach family circle in Leipzig, also became a likely candidate. Bach himself was an able violinist from his youth, and his familiarity with the violin and its literature shows in the composition of the set and the very detailed autograph manuscript, as does incidental fingering in the text. According to his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, \"in his youth, and until the approach of old age, he played the violin cleanly and powerfully\".\n\nUpon Bach's death in 1750, the original manuscript passed into the possession, possibly through his second wife Anna Magdalena, of Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. It was inherited by the last male descendant of J. C. F. Bach, Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach, who passed it on to his sister Christina Louisa Bach (1762–1852).\n\nFour other early manuscripts also exist. One, originally identified as an authentic Bach autograph from his Leipzig period, is now identified as being a copy dating from 1727–32 by Bach's second wife Anna Magdalena Bach, and is the companion to her copy of the six suites Bach wrote for solo cello. Another copy, dated July 3, 1726 (the date is on the final page), made by one of Bach's admirers Johann Peter Kellner, is well preserved, despite the fact that the B minor Partita was missing from the set and that there are numerous deviations and omissions. These differences may have come from an earlier source or composing copy, and not necessarily copying errors on Kellner's part. This view is supported by Zoltán Szabó. The three manuscripts are in the Berlin State Museum and have been in the possession of the Bach-Gesellschaft since 1879, through the efforts of Alfred Dörffel. Two other eighteenth century manuscripts, both by unidentified copyists, have also survived.\n\nThe first edition was printed in 1802 by Nikolaus Simrock of Bonn. It is clear from errors in it that it was not made with reference to Bach's own manuscript, and it has many mistakes that were frequently repeated in later editions of the 19th century.\n\nOne of the most famous performers of the Sonatas and Partitas was the violinist and composer Georges Enescu, who considered this work as \"The Himalayas of violinists\" and recorded all the sonatas and partitas in the late 1940s. One of his students (Serge Blanc) collected the notes of his master Enescu regarding sonority, phrasing, tempo, fingering and expression, in a now freely distributed document.\n\nThe sonatas each consist of four movements, in the typical slow-fast-slow-fast pattern of the sonata da chiesa. The first two movements of each sonata are a prelude and a fugue. The third (slow) movement is lyrical, while the final movement shares the similar musical structure as a typical binary suite movement. Unlike the sonatas, the partitas are of more unorthodox design. Although still making use of the usual baroque style of allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue, with some omissions and the addition of galanteries, new elements were introduced into each partita to provide variety.\n\nAside from the surviving transcriptions BWV 964 and 968, two different sources also indicate that Bach and his circle performed the Sonatas and Partitas on keyboard instruments, rather than on the violin. Music theorist, instrument maker and organ player Jakob Adlung writes (\"Anleitung zu der musikalischen Gelahrtheit, Erfurt, 1758\"), regarding the keyboard works by Bach – ”They are actually \"violini soli senza basso\", 3 Sonatas and 3 Partitas, which are well suited for performance on the keyboard”. Johann Friedrich Agricola, who co-wrote Bach's obituary, reports that ”Their composer often played them himself on the clavichord, and added so much harmonies to them, as he found necessary”.\n\n\nThough the key signature of the manuscript suggests D minor, such was a notational convention in the Baroque period, and therefore does not necessarily imply that the piece is in the Dorian mode.\nThe second movement, the fugue, would later be reworked for the organ (in the Prelude and Fugue, BWV 539) and the lute (Fugue, BWV 1000), with the latter being two bars longer than the violin version.\n\n\nThis partita substitutes a bourrée (marked \"Tempo di Borea\") for the gigue. Each movement is followed by a variation (\"double\" in French).\n\n\n\nIn the original manuscript, Bach marked 'Segue la Corrente' at the end of Allemanda. The Chaconne, the last and most famous movement of the suite, was regarded as \"the greatest structure for solo violin that exists\" by Yehudi Menuhin.\n\n\nThe opening movement of the work introduced a peaceful, slow stacking up of notes, a technique once thought to be impossible on bowed instruments. The fugue is the most complex and extensive of the three, with the subject derived from the chorale Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott. Bach employs many contrapuntal techniques, including a stretto, an inversion, as well as diverse examples of double counterpoint.\n\n\n\nClassical violin\n\nBaroque violin\nKeyboard\n\nMandolin\n\n\nManuscripts and published editions\n\nBooks and journal articles\n\n"}

The rigor of the junior year classes exceeds high school honors and AP, with more than 1200 hours of instruction. Seniors complete a year of college, taking the same classes as other students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. WPI is a nationally ranked engineering school, thus making the Academy the only public school in Massachusetts whose students attend a university full-time as seniors in high school. The Academy was originally located in the sub-basement of WPI's library, but is now located nearby at 85 Prescott Street, near the WPI bioengineering complex.\n\nThe Academy is a collaborative effort among the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and the high schools of Massachusetts. In addition to passing all classes, the Academy also requires that all students complete 50 hours of community service per year.\n\nIn October 2018, Niche.com selected the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science as the best public high school in Massachusetts with a student-teacher ratio of 14:1, a diversity grade of A, and a college prep grade of A+.\n\nStudents who want to attend the Academy must apply in the sophomore year of high school, although some exceptions have been made. For example, an occasional freshmen has entered the Academy in what would have been his/her sophomore year at their \"sending\" school. Othertimes, high school juniors have elected to repeat their eleventh grade at the Academy.\n\nThe admissions process is very selective. Grades, teacher recommendations, personal essay, and the academy exam serve as the primary indicators of student ability and motivation.\n\nIn 1992, the requirements for entry into the academy required a minimum of 1 years advanced in math and/or science and 2 years ahead in one of the subjects. The admissions process has been changed to the above so this is no longer required; however, only 1/6 of the self-selected group of applicants are offered admission.\n\nThe Academy encourages students who wish to attend to visit the school for a day. These visitors, called \"shadows,\" follow a host student so as to experience a typical day.\n\nJunior year students attend classes from 7:45 a.m. until 2:45 p.m, followed by extracurricular activities until 4 PM. Mandatory classes include Mathematical Modeling, Physics, Humanities, Computer Science, STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math), Science and Technical Writing, and Foreign Language. STEM I is a class in which students take on an original research investigation that makes some contribution in that field. Students can either conduct science, math or engineering projects. This class culminates with a science fair in February. STEM II is an engineering class in which students work in three- and four-person teams to develop a piece of assistive technology. These projects are designed with a specific client in mind, usually a young student with a physical handicap. The foreign language classes are also different from most schools. In addition to grammar and translation, the class period consists of making a movie completely in either Spanish or French, singing songs written in foreign language, and discussion in the target language. Two days a week after school students participate in 1.5 hour elective periods, where students can take a class of their choosing. The electives offered each term differ, but have included social dancing, cooking, machine shop, bowling, film appreciation, water colors, photography, advanced mathematics, mock trial, speech and debate, FIRST Robotics, kickboxing, puzzles, German, and drama.\n\nThe faculty at the Academy consist of Master Teachers and Visiting Scholars. Master Teachers are faculty who return every year, whereas Visiting Scholars typically come with backgrounds in various fields outside education, and develop their teaching skills over the course of a year or two.\n\n\"C-term\", running from early January to the middle of March, is generally agreed to be by far the most difficult. The \"STEM I\" projects (formerly STREAM A for Science Technology Research Engineering and Mathematics, and before that, RS for Research Seminar) and papers must be completed in this time span - these involve individual research into areas not typically studied by high-school students, such as heuristics and mechanical design.\n\nDuring their senior year, students take on a full-time course load at WPI. There is no tuition charged to the student. Each term students take one math class, one science class, and one humanities class for a total of twelve courses in 4 terms. In addition, by the end of senior year, each student must complete a senior independent study project. In order to remain in the Academy, students must get a grade of \"C\" or higher in all 3 A-term classes and in 11 of 12 courses taken at WPI.\n\nMass Academy has sent students to Harvard University, Cornell University, Brown University, Yale University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California, Berkeley, McGill University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, California Institute of Technology, and many other top schools since its inception in 1992. Many schools accept all WPI credits, allowing Mass Academy students to graduate a year early.\n\nBecause of the association with WPI, Mass Academy students enjoy many amenities offered by WPI. Students at Mass Academy have access to much of what WPI offers. The student center, for example, is a prized social place for Academy students. In the classroom, professors report that Mass Academy seniors tend to be highly engaged class participants and do very well academically. As of 2003, Massachusetts Academy students averaged over 3.0 on a 4 point grading scale, even with the Academy counting \"NR\" grades as failing \"NC\" grades.\n\nMass Academy seniors are issued IDs that can be used as a regular WPI ID to gain access to various WPI facilities including the gym, library, bowling alley, computer labs, and courts.\n\nMass Academy students, however, are prohibited from joining any sport teams, varsity or club, at WPI. As high school students, NCAA rules make them ineligible for college teams. Students are also prohibited from entering the dormitories at WPI. Any student found in a dormitory will face harsh consequences, which could ultimately lead to an expulsion from the Academy.\n\nMost students graduating from Mass Academy will meet freshmen math requirements in college since three or more terms of calculus is required of everyone. Many students will be eligible to graduate a year early from college because of the year at WPI. Almost all colleges accept credits from WPI, which is ranked 62 on US Newsweek top 100 Universities in the nation.\n\nMass Academy students have won numerous awards at the state, regional, national, and international levels. Each year at least 10 or 11 Mass Academy students achieve honorable mention, thirds, seconds and firsts at the Massachusetts State Science Fair. Three have won the prestigious Fish and Richardson Award. Students have also performed well on the annual Math Modeling competition, with some achieving regional outstanding.\n\nWhile the school is known for a strong math and science program, students who attend the school are also very talented in the humanities. Many students are accomplished musicians with some achieving statewide recognition. Some students have won recognition in national writing contests. The Academy also finished strong the Massachusetts Envirothon competition for the past several years.\n\nIn addition, Mass Academy alumnus, Andy Ross, is in the Grammy award winning band OK Go.\n\nA junior who fails the first term may be asked to return to his/her sending school before it is too late so as to avoid damaging the student's high school transcript. The reason for this is that students who do not pass the first term are unlikely to pass the proceeding terms.\n\nAny senior who fails a class during the first term of WPI classes will be asked to return to his/her sending school. A single failure in any other term requires a summer make-up course while two or more failures in any other term leads to a return to the sending school. This is so that students who are unable to handle the college courses are still able to graduate at their sending schools.\n\n"}

{"id": "1950204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950204", "title": "Miramichi Valley", "text": "Miramichi Valley\n\nThe Miramichi Valley is a Canadian river valley and region in the east-central part of New Brunswick. It extends along both major branches of the Miramichi River and their tributaries, however it is generally agreed that the much larger Southwest Miramichi River forms the majority of this region as it is more settled than the Northwest Miramichi River.\n\nSome communities throughout the valley include (from upriver to downriver): Juniper, Boiestown, Doaktown, Blackville, Red Bank, Sunny Corner, Renous-Quarryville, and the city of Miramichi which is an amalgamation of the former towns of Newcastle and Chatham, as well as the former villages of Nelson-Miramichi, Loggieville and Douglastown.\n\nThere are three Mi'kmaq reserves within the Miramichi River watershed: Natoaganeg (Eel Ground) First Nation, Esgenoôpetitj (Burnt Church) First Nation, and Metepenagiag (Red Bank) Mi'kmaq Nation.\n\nLargely influenced by the continental climate, the Miramichi River valley typically experiences westerly winds from the interior, although coastal areas of the estuarine portion can experience easterly winds off the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the late summer. During fall, winter and spring, the colder air mass of the northern interior of North America frequently flows over the Miramichi Valley, but the close proximity of the Gulf of St. Lawrence tends to moderate this effect.\n\nThe colder waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence also moderate the spring and summer months, producing a later spring than corresponding areas further inland, due to sea ice. Falls are correspondingly later, since the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawerence retain heat for a longer period than the areas inland.\n\nThe Miramichi River and its estuarine portion traditionally freezes solid for three to four months each winter. This is beginning to change as a result of changing climate trends, however as late as the 1950s, before a bridge was built at Chatham, NB, cars would regularly cross the river using the ice, and small trucks of fish buyers would venture down river on the ice to purchase smelt directly from ice fishermen at their nets.\n\nThe average rainfall is in the order of 1-1.1 m.\n\nLying near the northern limit of many eastern hardwoods in the Acadian Forest Region, Miramichi Valley forests are diverse.\n\nBalsam fir, black spruce and red spruce are common. Other coniferous trees include white spruce, eastern white pine, red pine, jack pine, tamarack, eastern hemlock, and eastern white cedar).\n\nBroad-leaved deciduous trees include yellow birch, paper birch, grey birch, red maple, sugar maple, balsam poplar, trembling aspen, bigtooth aspen, speckled alder, northern red oak, American elm, American beech, and black ash. Silver maple and butternut are uncommon, but can be found at alluvial sites along the Southwest Miramichi River. Hop hornbeam (=Ironwood) and white ash are uncommon to rare, but do occur on well-drained upland soils.\n\nLand ownership in the Miramichi River valley reflects human settlement patterns, with most private land ownership having been derived from the Crown grant and extending inland, perpendicular to the river and its tributaries. Many families maintain private woodlots for firewood or commercial uses. Remaining Crown land, inland from the river, is managed by the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources. These lands have been managed primarily to support the pulp and paper industry via timber leases to forestry companies. Controversy has arisen in recent decades about forest management practises which have included clear cutting.\n\nThe Miramichi River valley supports some farming, mostly located on the better topsoils within the floodplain. Crop farming is rare, with potatoes, turnips, oats, and wheat being most common. Some residents maintain small vegetable gardens for personal use in communities throughout the valley. Dairy farming is common, as is cultivation of blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and cranberries. Some failed farms which had been cleared in colonial times have reverted to forest.\n\nAlthough not strictly agriculture, the Miramichi River valley also sees an annual spring harvest of wild \"fiddleheads\", the curled heads of ostrich ferns which grow on the riverbanks and in the floodplain after the spring freshet.\n\nThe Miramichi River is famous for Atlantic Salmon fly-fishing (rod and reel), whereas the estuary once supported an extensive fishery for salmon, shad, gaspereau and smelt. Although these commercial harvests have declined (commercial fishing of Atlantic Salmon having been banned since the 1960s), the lobster fishery has grown to become the highest value food fishery in the region, with the lobster fleet sailing primarily out of ports such as Neguac, Hardwicke, Baie-Sainte-Anne, and Escuminac. The Miramichi River estuary also supports some oyster harvesting and aquaculture, particularly cultivated mussels.\n\nMost commercial fish stocks have been in a state of decline, particularly Atlantic Salmon. Despite these declines, the Miramichi River still supports one of the largest annual runs of Atlantic salmon in North America. These declines in Atlantic salmon runs are often blamed on the Greenland offshore fishery, global climate change, as well as local overfishing. Recent forest management practises such as clear cutting and herbicide applications which denigrate the riparian zone along the river and its tributaries, as well as industrial pollution share some blame as well.\n\nThe Miramichi River watershed supports a large population of land mammals and waterfowl, particularly white-tailed deer, moose, American black bear, ducks and the Canada goose. Other animals include red fox, northeast coyote, mink, fisher, weasel, skunk, porcupine, beaver, and muskrat among many others.\n\nPrior to European settlement, the area also supported woodland caribou (a relative of the Arctic caribou which inhabited northeastern North America), as well as the eastern cougar and wolves. A remnant population of the Eastern Cougar is thought to inhabit parts of New Brunswick and Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, possibly including the Miramichi River watershed. A Grey Wolf pack is thought to have recently returned to the Miramichi Highlands from the Gaspé Peninsula.\n\nHunting of large land mammals such as deer, moose, as well as waterfowl such as ducks and geese is permitted each fall. The elusive American black duck is particularly prized by hunters. There is a limited bear hunt each spring, although its continuation is being debated. The guiding industry is an economic contributor to the local economy during hunting season.\n\nOriginally settled by Maritime Archaic Indians, the Miramichi River valley was controlled by the Mi'kmaq Nation at the time of European discovery. As part of Acadia under French colonial control, the region saw little French settlement. The Mi'kmaq from the Miramichi River valley sided with France during the wars between Britain and France from 1689 to 1763, sometimes sending raiding parties into New England to attack settlements during the Seven Years' War.\n\nFollowing the siege of Fortress Louisbourg in 1758, British forces on their way to Quebec City attacked French settlements on Ile-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island) and continued along the coast, where they entered the lower Miramichi River valley and destroyed and scattered the small Acadian settlements. They also attacked and burned a small Mi'kmaq village at Ste-Anne (present-day Burnt Church, NB).\n\nThe Miramichi River valley initially became a refuge for Acadians fleeing the Great Upheaval in the Annapolis Valley, Tantramar Marshes and Ile-Saint-Jean following the Seven Years' War, however these families were soon forced to move to more isolated coastal areas to the northeast. Under British control, the area was part of the Colony of Nova Scotia from 1756-1784 but was largely forgotten. Some settlement trickled from the Loyalist refugees flooding the Saint John River valley to the south and west, however it was only after the Colony of New Brunswick was established in 1784 that colonial administrators looked favourably upon the Miramichi region.\n\nThe Highland Clearances and Britain's Industrial Revolution soon saw a Scottish migration into the Miramichi River valley, some of them demobilized veterans of the American Revolutionary War, and others directly coming from the Scottish Highlands. They were the first permanent English-speaking settlers and their early industriousness continues as a legacy to the various communities throughout the valley.\n\nWilliam Davidson was among the first Scots, arriving in 1767. English settlers were present too, as evidenced by the Anglican Churches established throughout the valley. Acadians began to drift back into the area as early as 1769, settling the shorelands along the lower bay. A small number of United Empire Loyalists arrived, establishing themselves particularly in the upriver areas, where Squire Doak established the village of Doaktown. In 1825, a massive forest fire, called \"The Great Miramichi Fire\", burned 20% of New Brunswick's forests, leveling several communities in the central part of the colony including Newcastle and Douglastown.\n\nLarge numbers of Irish arrived in the Miramichi River valley, both before and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849). Middle Island, in the inner bay of the estuarine portion of the Miramichi River, served as a quarantine station. Though some Irish immigrants farmed, especially in Barnaby River, St. Margarets and Sevogle River, many were drawn to the established towns and villages, perhaps because the Scots and English had taken up the best land.\n\nTrade with Britain and the West Indies was a cornerstone of the Miramichi River valley economy throughout a large part of the 19th century. An important export up until the 1850s was Eastern White Pine trunks which were used as masts on Royal Navy vessels. Fur was an early export to European markets and later exports included lumber, pulpwood, and pit props for Welsh coal mines. The United States began to replace Britain as the most important market for the Miramichi River valley after the 1850s. Salmon and forest products found a market in Boston, MA, with these commodities being shipped by schooner, with rum and molasses being common return cargoes.\n\nThe National Policy of Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservative government after Confederation in 1867 was not to the advantage of Miramichi lumbermen and fish buyers. The high tariff walls designed to protect Ontario manufacturers meant higher prices for imports, and tariff barriers on exports to the United States.\n\nThe National Policy is believed to be a contributing factor in explaining the long Liberal predominance in Miramichi elections, and the prominence of lumber and fish merchants and business leaders among Liberal MPs and Senators in the Parliament of Canada and Members of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. Notable among these are Senators Jabez Bunting Snowball, a lumber merchant and shipowner from Chatham, NB, and Percy Burchill, a lumber merchant from Nelson-Miramichi, NB; Members of Parliament included W.S. Loggie, a fish and general merchant from Chatham, NB, Richard Hutchinson, a lumber merchant from Newcastle, NB, and John Maloney, a lumber merchant; Members of the Legislative Assembly included W. Stafford Anderson, a lumber merchant from Newcastle, NB, whose daughter Margaret Anderson served in the Senate.\n\nSawmills were a typical Miramichi industry from colonial times, but pulp mills were established at both Newcastle and Chatham in the late nineteenth century and, though the Chatham mill is long closed, the one in Newcastle continued in operation until recently. Fish packing remained important until recent times, with Loggieville and Escuminac being two sites. For many years, pit props were exported to the Welsh and English coal mines, though the volume suggests that many ended up in British pulp mills.\n\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, railways were built to the Miramichi River valley, beginning with the Intercolonial Railway in 1875, which crossed the Southwest and Northwest Miramichi Rivers at tidewater just upstream from Newcastle on its way between Moncton, NB and Bathurst, NB. This section of the Intercolonial formed part of the Halifax, NS to Rivière-du-Loup, QC main line and was purposely routed along the eastern shore of New Brunswick for military purposes, to keep it away from the border with the United States.\n\nThe Northern and Western Railway (later the Canada Eastern Railway) was built in the mid-1880s from Fredericton to Boisetown where it then ran along the Southwest Miramichi River through Chatham to terminate at the port at Loggieville, intersecting with the Intercolonial at Nelson. The line was purchased several years later by the Intercolonial and part of the line between Renous-Quarryville and Nelson was rerouted. A passenger train on this route was given the informal nickname, the \"Dungarvon Whooper\".\n\nOceangoing steamships and motor vessels regularly visited ports along the river until fairly recently. The decision by the federal government to concentrate all ocean shipping activities in northern New Brunswick at the port of Belledune, NB in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to a decision by the mid-1990s to discontinue dredging at the entrance to Miramichi Bay. This has led to significant silting of the navigation channel although some ships still call at the ports of Chatham and Newcastle.\n\nThe Miramichi River valley is home to about 45,000 people, mainly of mixed Irish, Scottish, English, French and Mi'kmaq descent. Traditionally, the shores of the estuarine portion of the Miramichi River valley were predominantly Acadian fishing communities, whereas Chatham was an Irish community and Newcastle and many towns upriver were Scottish communities. Over the past 100 years or more, Acadians have been migrating into the amalgamated city of Miramichi and surrounding areas. The \"English speaking\" community (of Irish, Scottish or English descent) and the \"French speaking\" community (of Acadian descent) have witnessed much intermarriage between the two groups in the last 80 years and relations are generally good.\n\nThere has been little immigration to the Miramichi River valley since the Irish Potato Famine, producing a particular personality among Miramichiers who are regarded as friendly, but with a touch of reserve, generous, but also very independent, and with a wry sense of humour, especially in evidence when someone is suspected of \"putting on airs\". They are passionately attached to their valley.\n\nAnother factor that united Miramichiers of all ethnic backgrounds was the shared experience of two world wars. Casualties were especially heavy in the First World War, when just about every street in the towns throughout the river valley had men killed or returned wounded and/or shell-shocked. During the Second World War Miramichi River valley soldiers went ashore on D-Day with the North Shore Regiment and went through the heavy fighting in northern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Others served with the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\n\n"}

As of August 2019, Willits is the chief creative officer at Saber Interactive.\n\nWillits is a computer science and business graduate of the University of Minnesota and a former member of the University of Minnesota Army ROTC program. Willits was the battalion cadet-command sergeant major (C/CSM) during his junior year and attended ROTC Advanced Camp at Fort Lewis, Washington during the summer between his junior and senior years of college. After an injury during the summer, Willits completed two rotations, being assigned to both the first and seventh cadet regiments during that summer. He held the rank of cadet-major (C/MAJ) during his senior year and was assigned as the battalion training officer.\n\nMarried for the second time in 2009, Willits currently lives in a Dallas suburb with his wife, Alison Barron Willits. Together, both of them have triplets.\n\nWillits has stated in numerous interviews that he was inspired to make video games when he downloaded a shareware version of \"Doom\". He played the first room of E1M1, thinking that was the entire demo, then, discovering a door that led the player to the other rooms. It was that moment when the door opened, Willits was transported into making video games. Willits required assistance with developing doors in future levels and games. He joined id Software in 1995 after impressing the owners and development team with Doom levels he forged in his spare time and distributed free over the Internet. Willits has worked on \"Strife\", \"The Ultimate Doom\", \"Quake\", \"Quake II\", \"Quake III Arena\", \"\" and \"Doom 3\".\n\nWillits was lead designer on \"Doom 3\", and executive producer on \"Quake 4\".\n\nHe was the creative director on \"Rage\" and \"Quake Live\".\n\nWillits was referenced in the \"Doom\" movie as \"Dr. Willits\".\n\nWillits is the only id Software employee who has been to every single QuakeCon event since its inception in 1996, which is something he is proud of.\n\nWillits was leading as game director on the arena shooter, \"Quake Champions\".\n\nOn July 18 2019, Willits announced he would leave id Software after serving for 24 years. He is now the chief creative officer at Saber Interactive.\n\nWillits received attention in August 2017 for claiming that he created the concept of multiplayer maps during the development of \"Quake\". According to Willits, he approached coworkers John Romero and John Carmack with the idea of maps which could only be played in multiplayer, which Willits claimed the two dismissed as \"the stupidest idea they'd ever heard\". The following day, Romero refuted Willits' statement on his personal blog, claiming that Willits' alleged encounter between him and Carmack never happened. Carmack said that he does not recall the conversation between Tim Willits, John Romero, and himself, and he trusts Romero's recollection of events, in line with the account detailed on Romero's blog. Romero explained that many hundreds of deathmatch-only maps had been made for \"Doom\" prior to \"Quake's\" release, including a deathmatch map created by then-id Software employee American McGee. Romero also noted that \"Marathon\" and \"Rise of the Triad\", first person shooters which predated \"Quake\" by over a year, had a large variety of maps exclusive to multiplayer. Tom Hall, co-founder of id Software and director of \"Rise of the Triad\", gave his support for Romero. Willits responded to the article by posting an early video of a map fragment with elements of Q1DM3 shown named Tim14.bsp on his Instagram, and stated that \"He stands by what he said\".\n\nWillits was interviewed by Warren Spector in 2007, giving the same account of creating the concept of multiplayer-only maps. Willits also claimed to have created all of \"Quake's\" shareware levels; this was disputed by John Romero.\n\nIn January 2020, Willits was on the Arcade Attack Podcast and clarifies that when he talked about multiplayer-only maps he was specifically talking about Quake, not FPS games in general. He also added that Quake was the first FPS game that had dedicated client-server architecture for multiplayer.\n\nThese are the works Tim has done, which includes titles mostly from id Software:\n"}

It was first passed in 1920 and most recently revised in 1985. It attempts to ensure that these products are safe, that their ingredients are disclosed and that drugs are effective and are not sold as food or cosmetics. It also states that cures for disease listed in Schedule A (including cancer, obesity, anxiety, asthma, depression, appendicitis, and sexually transmitted diseases), cannot be advertised to the general public.\n\nAfter the launch of the Federal Department of Health in 1919, the \"Food and Drugs Act\" was presented in late 1920. Rules and regulations developed under the \"Act\" established the requirements for licensing and creating drugs in Canada. The law granted the Minister of Health the right to cancel or suspend licenses of companies failing to comply with the requirements.\n\nThe \"Food and Drugs Act\" was not significantly modified until 1947 when the foundations were laid for the current market today. In 1951, drug manufacturers were required to submit a file for each new drug prior to marketing their product. However, during the early 1960s, the drug thalidomide, which had been approved to enter the market, resulted in the deaths of thousands of infants and severe birth defects in others when the drug was taken by women in early stages of pregnancy.\n\nAs a result of the problems caused by the drug thalidomide, the \"Act\" was revisited and strengthened by Health Canada. The revised version placed new requirements on manufacturers to provide evidence for efficacy in seeking a Notice of Compliance, which must be obtained before any drug could be sold. The manufacturer must meet all the requirements before making any drug available to the public, but once the drug passes with no adverse reactions and without any changes needed to the drug's formula, it may never be subjected to review by Health Canada again. Some health advocates want post-approval surveillance to watch for unexpected problems.\n\nPart I provides general interpretations of the terms, and provides details of each of the topics discussed on what the \"Act\" entails:\n\nPart II of the \"Act\" focuses the administration and the Enforcement that allows the government to intervene with the manufacturer.\nIt entails:\n\nParts III (enacted in 1961) and IV (enacted in 1969) provided for implementation of controls required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Part III dealt with \"controlled\" drugs such as amphetamine, methaqualone, and phenmetrazine, which have legitimate medical uses. Part IV focused on Schedule H \"restricted drugs\", those whose only legitimate use is for scientific research, such as the hallucinogens LSD, DMT, and MDMA. These parts established eight classes of regulated substances, ranging from Schedules A to H.\n\nThe 1996 \"Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\" repealed Parts III and IV.\n\nOn April 2008, an amendment to the \"Food and Drugs Act\", Canadian Bill C-51 was tabled in the House of Commons. The purpose of this bill was to modernize the regulatory system for foods and therapeutic products, to strengthen the oversight of the benefits and risks of therapeutic products throughout their life cycle, to support effective compliance and enforcement actions and to enable a greater transparency and openness of the regulatory system. Some of the proposed amendments are as follows:\n\n\nThe bill has been subject to criticism due to a perception that the bill would illegalize all food and Natural Health Products by categorizing them as drug products. Natural health products in Canada have been regulated as a subset of drugs since the Natural Health Products Regulations were put into place on January 1, 2004. Health Canada has stated \"The Natural Health Product Regulations, introduced in 2004, will continue to operate the same way under Bill C-51. Canadians will continue to have access to natural health products that are safe, effective and of high quality.\n\nIn spite of this claim, The Natural Health Industry remained skeptical. A watchdog group was employed to investigate the concerns and a number of hidden camera videos surfaced that further aggravated the NHP industry concerns. \n\nThe end result was a series of large protests in cities across Canada and a great deal of criticism being directed at then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Cabinet minister Tony Clement.\n\n\n"}

While at Arizona State, he played in the 1975 and 1976 College World Series on teams that included future major leaguers Floyd Bannister, Chris Bando, and Bob Horner.\n\nLandreaux was then selected by the California Angels in the first round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. In his major league debut with the Angels, on September 11, 1977, against the Chicago White Sox, Landreaux threw out three base runners from the outfield.\n\nIn , the Angels traded Landreaux, Dave Engle, Paul Hartzell, and Brad Havens to the Minnesota Twins for Rod Carew. In 1980, Landreaux set a Minnesota record with a 31-game hitting streak, tied for the longest in the AL since Dom DiMaggio's 34 in 1949.

{"id": "1950226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950226", "title": "Provisional application", "text": "Provisional application\n\nUnder United States patent law, a provisional application is a legal document filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), that establishes an early filing date, but does not mature into an issued patent unless the applicant files a regular non-provisional patent application within one year. There is no such thing as a \"provisional patent\". \n\nA provisional application includes a specification, i.e. a description, and drawing(s) of an invention (drawings are required where necessary for the understanding of the subject matter sought to be patented), but does not require formal patent claims, inventors' oaths or declarations, or any information disclosure statement (IDS). Furthermore, because no examination of the patentability of the application in view of the prior art is performed, the USPTO fee for filing a provisional patent application is significantly lower ($70 - $280 as of January 16, 2018) than the fee required to file a standard non-provisional patent application. A provisional application can establish an early effective filing date in one or more continuing patent applications later claiming the priority date of an invention disclosed in the provisional application by one or more of the same inventors. \n\nThe same term is used in past and current patent laws of other countries with different meanings.\n\nThe provisional application was introduced to U.S. patent law with a 1994 amendment of the Patent Act of 1952. A 12-month benefit of priority to foreign-filed applications had been a part of U.S. patent law since the 1901 U.S. ratification of the Brussels revision of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. The 1994 introduction of the provisional application thus provided a domestic filing equivalent matching the 12-month priority benefit that had been afforded to foreign applications for the better part of the 20th century.\n\nThe earliest filing date of a \"provisional\" (application) may be very important where, for example, a statutory condition of patentability is about to expire and there is insufficient time to generate a complete non-provisional application. In many cases, a provisional is filed the same day as a public disclosure of the invention, which disclosure could otherwise permanently jeopardize the patentability in non-U.S. countries having strict requirements on \"complete or absolute novelty\". In other cases the provisional application is filed soon after such a disclosure in order to preserve only the inventor's U.S. patent rights.\n\nThe date of filing of the provisional patent application can also be used as the foreign priority date for applications filed in countries other than the United States and for an international application, but not for a design patent. The filing of a provisional application triggers a review period for the U.S. license necessary for the subsequent foreign or international filings. Though the \"provisional\" need not be submitted in English, a translation will be required when (and if) a non-provisional application claims the benefit of the provisional.\n\nA provisional application, as such, is never examined by the USPTO, and therefore will never become a patent on its own (unless the provisional patent application is later converted into a non-provisional patent application by the applicant, and then the application is examined as a non-provisional application). The provisional application is also not \"published\", but becomes a part of any later non-provisional application file that references it, and thus becomes \"public\" upon issuance of a patent claiming its priority benefit.\n\nA \"provisional\" is automatically abandoned (expires) one year after it is filed. The provisional filing date is not counted as part of the 20-year life of any patent that may issue with a claim to the provisional filing date.\n\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) announced on December 8, 2010, that it was implementing a Missing Parts Pilot Program. This pilot program would provide applicants with a 12-month extension to the existing 12-month provisional application period. This pilot program would not change the requirement for an applicant to file a non-provisional application within 12 months; though it would allow additional time to reply to a missing parts notice.\n\nTo obtain the benefit of the \"provisional\" filing date, a non-provisional patent application must be filed, claiming benefit of the filing date of one or more specific provisional patent applications, prior to their expiration. \n\nThe provisional patent application is only pending for 12 months prior to becoming abandoned. Thus, filing a non-provisional patent application claiming the benefit of the provisional application must be done within 12 months. Otherwise, the rights to claim the benefit of provisional application are lost.\n\nIf a non-provisional application is not expected to be filed within one year, and the patent is not otherwise barred by law, another provisional application may also be filed at any time and start another one-year period (but this does not work in all cases). However, the original priority date of any expired provisional applications will be forfeited. \n\nThe provisional priority date is of little consequence for any claims in the issued patent that are not supported by the disclosure in the priority document. This makes it very important that provisional applications be sufficiently detailed. Otherwise, the validity of an issued patent may be challenged as to the priority date of its claims that purport to relate back to an insufficient \"provisional\". Furthermore, during the year after filing the first provisional (and prior to filing a non-provisional application), it may be useful to file additional provisional applications as improvements are made, and then claim priority of those found useful in drafting the non-provisional application(s).\n\nOne popular use of a provisional application is to document and \"lock in\" potential patent rights while attempting to obtain sponsors for further development (and for more expensive patent applications). This tactic may permit an inventor to defer major patent application costs until the commercial viability (or futility) of the invention becomes apparent. However, wise investors consider provisional applications in view of the long road to potential patentability, not to mention the limitations that may be defined by the prior art.\n\nIf a prior-art search during the one-year period reveals that what the inventor thought was the invention is found to be an obvious aggregation of prior-art elements or steps, the invention may still be patentable if the provisional application describes a non-obvious novel structure, element, or step. This novel structure can be claimed in the non-provisional patent application, instead of claiming the invalid aggregation. \n\nInformation Disclosure Statements (IDSs) are not permitted in provisional applications. Since no substantive examination is given in provisional applications, a disclosure of information is unnecessary. Any such statement filed in a provisional application will be returned or destroyed at the option of the Office.\n\nThe advantages of a provisional patent application are:\n\nAs of January 16, 2018, the USPTO small-entity filing fee is $140 for provisional patent applications having 100 or fewer pages of specification and drawings. Complexity involved for a provisional application on the part of both the applicant and the USPTO is generally much less than that of a non-provisional patent application. Thus, it is possible to file a provisional patent application more quickly and cheaply than a non-provisional patent application. \n\nIt is also possible to convert a non-provisional application into a provisional, under limited circumstances (e.g., within a year of filing, when the applicant discovers a reason not to pursue the present non-provisional application).\n\nA number of free or almost-free resources exist to help inventors prepare and/or file their provisional applications. The USPTO provides information related to its patent pro bono program, which aims at assisting \"inventors and small businesses that meet certain financial thresholds and other criteria ... for free legal assistance in preparing and filing a patent application.\" The website provides links to USPTO endorsed websites that provide free pro bono services to inventors. Further, the USPTO also permits law school students to practice IP law under the guidance of law school faculty supervisor and provides a list of participating law schools on its website.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1950261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950261", "title": "Boardman River", "text": "Boardman River\n\nThe Boardman River is a river that flows into the west arm of Grand Traverse Bay in Traverse City, Michigan. The Boardman's upper tributaries rise near Kalkaska, Michigan, and its watershed drains an area of through of river and tributaries. The Boardman River is considered one of the top ten trout streams in Michigan. Before entering the Grand Traverse Bay, it becomes Boardman Lake, a natural lake that was originally in size and increased to after the Union Street Dam was constructed in 1867. After flowing through Boardman Lake, the river descends through downtown Traverse City, following a hairpin-shaped course to Grand Traverse Bay. This Traverse City section of the Boardman River is accessible by motorboat from the lakeshore up to a weir upstream from the lakeshore. A short distance upstream from the weir is the Union Street Dam, a small decommissioned mill dam located between Cass and Union streets. The river's principal tributaries are Kids Creek, Beitner Creek, Swainston Creek, and the North and South branches of the river.\n\nIn the year 1847, Captain Horace Boardman of Naperville, Illinois, purchased land on the Grand Traverse Bay. He was the namesake of the Boardman River, which had previously been known as the Ottawa River.\n\nLater in 1800s, as Traverse City was first being settled, the Union Street Dam was being built by the Hannah-Lay Company as a saw mill. Around this time, citizens were dumping sewage into the Boardman, which was causing severe health problems.\n\nIn 1869, Boardman Lake became a great tourist attraction for the citizens of Traverse City. The Oval Wood Dish Company built a factory on the northwestern shores of the lake. The western shore of the lake was used for a log rollaway and rail yard on the Great Lakes Central Railroad, up until the early 2000s.\n\nIn 1894, the Boardman Dam was being built upstream from the Union Street Dam as a hydroelectric power plant. The building of this dam created Boardman Pond and diverted the stream. This ancient flow channel is called the relic channel.\n\nThe Sabin, Keystone, and Brown Bridge dams were built during the oncoming years. The building of the Keystone Dam flooded the small towns of Beitner and Keystone. Over time, these dams withstood many floods, and in 2013, the Brown Bridge Dam was removed, draining Brown Bridge Pond. The Keystone Pond was demolished sometime in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2017, Boardman Dam was demolished, and the Boardman River was diverted to the relic channel permanently. That same year, the Murchie Bridge near the mouth of the Boardman River was replaced. The next year in August 2018, Sabin Dam was removed, leaving only the Union Street dam left on the river.\n\nBoardman Lake is one of two bodies of water on the mainstream Boardman River (the other being Sabin Pond). It is the largest body of water on the river, and always has been. It is located about 1.65 miles (2.65 km) upstream from the mouth of the river in Grand Traverse Bay. When the Union Street Dam was built in 1894, the size of Boardman Lake grew by about 33.3%.\n\nThis lake is also a popular recreational and fishing lake. It has an abundance of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Sunfish, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.\n\nThe lake is an important part of the course of the Boardman River and the history of Traverse City.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree dams on the river are being removed: Sabin, Boardman and Brown Bridge. On October 6, 2012, a temporary structure put in place to facilitate drawdown at Brown Bridge Dam was breached, flooding the river valley. In June 2014 the Michigan DEQ issued a report identifying erosion around the temporary drawdown structure as the likely cause of the failure.\n\nBrown Bridge Dam removal was completed in January 2013 and resulted in the reestablishment of 2.5 miles of river channel. Revegetation and restoration work in the project area is ongoing. In preparation for the removal of the Boardman and Sabin Dams, both spillways have been opened and the impoundments have been drawn down as low as permitted by the permanent structures in place today.

The species is only known to live on Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County, northern California.\n\nIt has been found on the edge of chaparral but may be a refugee there, squeezed out of more open areas by exotics. Since its rediscovery seeds have been collected for controlled propagation and preservation.\n\nMt. Diablo buckwheat is an annual plant growing between high. It blooms with several dozen pinkish flowers, having a maroon line down the center of each petal. The flower stalks branch upward in a wishbone pattern, with flowers blooming at the joint and ends of the wishbone.\n\nThe first recorded sighting of Mt. Diablo buckwheat was by William H. Brewer, the first Chair of Agriculture at the Yale University Sheffield Scientific School. He was Principal Assistant for botany on the Josiah Whitney-led California Geological Survey from 1860-1864. Brewer first recorded the Mt. Diablo buckwheat at John Marsh's Rancho Los Meganos at the northeast corner of Mt. Diablo, on May 29, 1862. Marsh was the first American settler in Contra Costa County (the present-day San Francisco East Bay) and a proponent of increased American emigration. Approximately 4,000 acres (16 km²) of the Marsh Ranch have been preserved around Marsh's stone house in the new Cowell Ranch State Park. From 1862-1936 the Mount Diablo buckwheat was found just a handful of times, for a total of seven historic records.\n\nIn 1936 Mary Leolin Bowerman, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley and who later co-founded the Save Mount Diablo organization in 1971, recorded the last sighting of Mt. Diablo buckwheat. Bowerman made two of the seven historic records, on opposite sides of Mt. Diablo, Contra Costa County, California during her floristic study between 1930 and 1936. Her 1936 Ph.D. was followed in 1944 by publication of \"The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Mt. Diablo, California\". Much of Mt. Diablo has been preserved in the years since Bowerman's study was completed, as well as areas where other buckwheat records were established. However, the eastern areas of the plant's range are threatened by development pressure.\n\nUntil 2005 numerous botanical survey trips were unsuccessful in locating the buckwheat.\n\nOn May 10, 2005 Michael Park, a University of California, Berkeley graduate student, was conducting a floristic study on Mt. Diablo. While more thoroughly searching promising areas on the mountain that hadn't gotten enough attention, he realized he was surrounded by early blooming buckwheat. Once he realized that it was Mount Diablo buckwheat he was so shocked that: \"I pretended it wasn't there and continued with my other work.\"\n\nA week after the rediscovery, a collaboration of organizations including the California Department of Parks & Recreation, Save Mount Diablo, and the University of California at Berkeley announced the rediscovery of the Mt. Diablo buckwheat. Coming soon after the announcement of the potential rediscovery of the Ivory-billed woodpecker, the news traveled around the world in just a few days and appeared in thousands of media outlets including print, radio and television.\n\nSeeds were collected from wild plants in 2005. On June 7, 2006, members of the Mt. Diablo Buckwheat Working Group announced that the plant had survived and increased in the wild and that twelve plants had been propagated at the U.C. Botanical Garden at Berkeley. Seeds were again collected in the wild and from propagated plants in 2006 and 2007. 2006 seed yield from propagated plants included more than 40,000 seeds. 2007 seed yield from propagated plants included more than 145,000 seeds.\n\nThe plant, an annual wildflower which dies after flowering and which is found at just one site, is still considered critically threatened. In December 2007 the Working Group seeded additional plots near the wild site.\n\nIt was reported in September 2016, that two botanists performing a wildflower survey in May 2016, at the Black Diamond Regional Preserve, a park near Mount Diablo, had unexpectedly found over a million Mount Diablo buckwheat specimens blooming on a hillside inside the preserve. Four organizations collaborated to withhold announcement of the discovery until the specimens had finished blooming and could produce seeds.\n\n"}

He was primarily in Japan and the Far East during the Korean War, and remained there after his service. In 1954 Rosen started Rosen Enterprises, Inc., which focused on selling art created in Japan to the American market, and photo studios for Japanese identification cards. The photo business was called Photorama and Rosen established studios in hundreds of locations all over Japan.\n\nIn 1957, Rosen Enterprises, Ltd. shifted its focus and pioneered the importation and operation of coin-op amusement machines popular in the United States, to Japan to meet the growing leisure market. Rosen leveraged his existing business relationships and locations of his Photorama photo studios to roll out the amusement machines.\n\nIn 1965, Rosen Enterprises, Ltd. Merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan, Ltd. (aka Service Games). Nihon Goraku Bussan, Ltd. used the brand name Sega (the name originates from SErvice GAmes Japan) for their jukeboxes and slot machines which were located on United States Military bases for amusement purposes. After the merger of the two companies, Sega Enterprises Ltd. was established and Rosen became Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the resulting company.\n\nRosen co-founded the Japan Amusement Association in 1967 and was elected as Chairman.\n\nIn 1966, under Rosen's direction, Sega Enterprises Ltd., created its first original game, called Periscope, which led to the introduction of 25¢ play in the United States and began Sega's export business.\n\nAfter meeting with Charles Bluhdorn in 1969, Rosen and partners agreed to sell Sega Enterprises Ltd. to the conglomerate Gulf+Western Industries, Inc., although Rosen remained CEO of the Sega division. In the early 1970s Sega was made a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures Corporation, which was also owned by Gulf+Western. During this period Barry Diller and Michael Eisner, both at Paramount joined Rosen on the Board of Sega and Rosen joined the Board at Paramount.\n\nIn 1978 Sega Enterprises Ltd. acquired a distribution company, Essco Tdg., that was founded by Hayao Nakayama.\n\nAfter the passing of Charles Bluhdorn, Gulf+Western wanted to sell off manufacturing assets, including Sega. Consequently, Sega's United States assets were sold to Bally Manufacturing Corporation.\n\nHaving already moved his family to Los Angeles and not wanting to return to Japan full-time, Rosen declined the opportunity of solely purchasing the Japanese assets of Sega. In March 1984, Rosen and Hayao Nakayama put together a buyout group led by Isao Okawa and purchased Sega's Japanese assets. Okawa became Chairman and Nakayama became President of Sega Ltd. This allowed Rosen to remain in the states while Nakayama was charged with the day-to-day operations of Sega's headquarters in Japan.\n\nRosen agreed to set up Sega of America and oversee the US & overseas operations, and he became Chairman of Sega of America which was headquartered in Los Angeles.

On the night of 16 November 1838, Ussher was roused from his bed to answer a knock on the door, only to be killed by a shot fired through a window.\n\nFleeing to the United States, in January 1839, Lett unsuccessfully attempted to burn British ships anchored at Kingston. That July, joined by Samuel Peters Hart and Henry J. Moon, the three embarked on a raid in Cobourg to rob and kill Robert Henry and abduct Sheppard McCormick, a veteran of the attack on the \"Caroline\". However, word leaked out and the plot was foiled with Lett just managing to escape to the American side of Lake Ontario. In the wake of the \"Cobourg conspiracy\" Lieutenant Governor Sir George Arthur posted a reward of £500 for his capture. In March 1841 Lett attempted to burn the \"SS Minos\" but failed.\n\nOn 17 April 1840 came the act Lett is best known for; the bombing of the monument to British general Sir Isaac Brock near Queenston, Ontario. The explosion did serious and irreparable damage to the monument although it failed to bring it down. Although Lett was presumed to have orchestrated the plot, a subsequent Assizes (court hearing) failed to confirm this.\n\nOn or about 5 June 1840 in Oswego, New York, Lett attempted to burn the British steamship \"Great Britain\" while she was leaving the harbour. Shortly before departure, a man identifying himself as \"Bill Johnson\" boarded the ship, placing a package containing three gunpowder-filled jars connected to a lit slow match at the door to the ladies' cabin. A few minutes after departing the Oswego wharf, the package exploded. However the damage was limited to a few broken windows in the ladies' cabin and the skylight above. Returning to dock, \"Bill Johnson\" and his accomplice, Benjamin Lett were shortly apprehended. While being transported on the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad to serve a seven-year prison sentence for the crime, the shackled Lett escaped from the railroad car he was in and leaped to freedom when the train was within a few miles of its destination of Auburn, New York. This brought an additional $350 bounty for his capture; $250 by Governor William H. Seward and $100 by the Sheriff.\n\nLett was also suspected of having been responsible for the bombing of Lock #37 (Allanburg) of the first Welland Canal on 9 September of the next year. However, his luck in evading authorities on both sides of the border came to an end and that same month, he was captured in Buffalo, N.Y. and placed in solitary confinement in the Auburn prison. There he was mistreated, leading to his pardon in 1845 by the Governor of New York, Silas Wright.\n\nIn 1858 Lett was hired by a whiskey maker in Earlville, IL to destroy the town school in retaliation for the mob of citizens that had destroyed his stock claiming it was poisoning the citizens. On 13 September 1858, the school exploded and during the resulting fire Lett and three others were arrested, with Lett being shot during his arrest.\n\nWhile en route to Lake Michigan for a trading expedition, Lett died mysteriously of strychnine poisoning in Milwaukee. His brother Thomas would later claim that Tory agents were behind his death. He was buried in the Lett Cemetery, Northville, Illinois.\n\n\n"}

Mosys uses a single-transistor storage cell (bit cell) like dynamic random access memory (DRAM), but surrounds the bit cell with control circuitry that makes the memory functionally equivalent to SRAM (the controller hides all DRAM-specific operations such as precharging and refresh). 1T-SRAM (and PSRAM in general) has a standard single-cycle SRAM interface and appears to the surrounding logic just as an SRAM would.\n\nDue to its one-transistor bit cell, 1T-SRAM is smaller than conventional (six-transistor, or \"6T\") SRAM, and closer in size and density to embedded DRAM (eDRAM). At the same time, 1T-SRAM has performance comparable to SRAM at multi-megabit densities, uses less power than eDRAM and is manufactured in a standard CMOS logic process like conventional SRAM. \n\nMoSys markets 1T-SRAM as physical IP for embedded (on-die) use in System-on-a-chip (SOC) applications. It is available on a variety of foundry processes, including Chartered, SMIC, TSMC, and UMC. Some engineers use the terms 1T-SRAM and \"embedded DRAM\" interchangeably, as some foundries provide MoSys's 1T-SRAM as \"eDRAM\". However, other foundries provide 1T-SRAM as a distinct offering.\n\n1T SRAM is built as an array of small banks (typically 128 rows × 256 bits/row, 32 kilobits in total) coupled to a bank-sized SRAM cache and an intelligent controller. Although space-inefficient compared to regular DRAM, the short word lines allow much higher speeds, so the array can do a full sense and precharge (RAS cycle) per access, providing high-speed random access. Each access is to one bank, allowing unused banks to be refreshed at the same time. Additionally, each row read out of the active bank is copied to the bank-sized SRAM cache. In the event of repeated accesses to one bank, which would not allow time for refresh cycles, there are two options: either the accesses are all to different rows, in which case all rows will be refreshed automatically, or some rows are accessed repeatedly. In the latter case, the cache provides the data and allows time for an unused row of the active bank to be refreshed.\nThere have been four generations of 1T-SRAM:\n\n1T-SRAM has speed comparable to 6T-SRAM (at multi-megabit densities). It is significantly faster speed than eDRAM, and the \"quad-density\" variant is only slightly larger (10–15% is claimed). On most foundry processes, designs with eDRAM require additional (and costly) masks and processing steps, offsetting the cost of a larger 1T-SRAM die. Also, some of those steps require very high temperatures and must take place after the logic transistors are formed, possibly damaging them.\n\n1T-SRAM is also available in device (IC) form. The Nintendo GameCube was the first video game system to use 1T-SRAM as a primary (main) memory storage; the GameCube possesses several dedicated 1T-SRAM devices. 1T-SRAM is also used in the successor to the GameCube, Nintendo's Wii console.\n\nNote that this is \"not\" the same as 1T DRAM, which is a \"capacitorless\" DRAM cell built using the parasitic channel capacitor of SOI transistors rather than a discrete capacitor.\n\nMoSys claims the following sizes for 1T-SRAM arrays:\nUS Patent 7,146,454 \"Hiding refresh in 1T-SRAM Architecture\"* (by Cypress Semiconductor) describes a similar system for hiding DRAM refresh using an SRAM cache.\n\n"}

He was the father of Sir Admiral Charles Fremantle, after whom the city Fremantle, in Western Australia, is named.\n\nFremantle was born in 1765, and joined the navy in 1777 aged eleven, aboard the frigate HMS \"Hussar\". Profiting from family influence, active commissions in the American War of Independence and a keen sense of seamanship and aggressive tactical awareness, promotion came easily. He was made a lieutenant on 13 March 1782 while on duty in Jamaica and promoted to commander on 13 November 1790, in command of the sloop HMS \"Spitfire\".\n\nHe was then in a good position to profit from the mass promotions that accompanied the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War in 1793, being made a post-captain on 16 May 1793 in the small frigate HMS \"Tartar\". In this ship he first came to the notice of Horatio Nelson, when they both served at the Siege of Bastia. During the siege, Nelson lost an eye and Fremantle gained a reputation for daring, taking his ship under the fortress walls despite heavy fire from above which had already sunk one frigate in the bay.\n\nThe following year Fremantle commanded the frigate HMS \"Inconstant\" and was engaged in Lord Hotham's indecisive and cautious fleet action in the Gulf of Genoa on 14 March 1795. The French fleet had departed from Toulon and were making for the Italian coast, pursued by Hotham's fleet and an approaching storm. Fremantle, despite unspoken rules of engagement which did not require him to engage ships larger than his own, used his superior speed to overtake the 80-gun \"Ça Ira\", which had been damaged in a collision. By taking his ship under the massive bow of his opponent, he managed to slow her enough for the oncoming British fleet to capture her and another French ship that had turned back in a rescue attempt. The first British ship to the scene was Nelson's HMS \"Agamemnon\", and respect between the two officers was further enhanced.\n\nAt Nelson's request, Fremantle was a companion and junior officer when he was detached to Italy in 1796. They wreaked havoc along the Italian coastline and evacuated British and royalist civilians to Corsica when the French army invaded. The took coastal positions and raided shore installations, capturing the island of Elba. One of the British refugees whom Fremantle rescued from Livorno were the 18-year-old Catholic Betsey Wynne, daughter of Richard Wynne (from the Anglo-Venetian Wynne family, acquainted with Casanova) and Camille de Royer. Fremantle married Betsey that year, with Prince Augustus as his best man. The same year he was embroiled in an engagement with Spanish gunboats off Cadiz, again under Nelson, and the next year he was with him at the disastrous Battle of Tenerife, where both were grievously wounded in the arm. Nelson's was amputated; Fremantle's survived, but he never regained full use of it.\n\nWhile convalescing at home, Fremantle honed his theories of successful command at sea, shown by several proposals he sent to the Admiralty concerning the judgement of petty disciplinary actions on board ship. Although these were rejected, they would later be used as models when the disciplinary system was revised in the 1850s. A very popular officer with his men, his contemporaries and the public alike, Fremantle did not remain at home long. When Nelson took command of the Channel Fleet, Fremantle joined him in August 1800 as commander of the ship of the line HMS \"Ganges\". With this ship he received further accolades for his service at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. He also dabbled in politics, standing unsuccessfully for the constituency of Sandwich in 1802, then winning it in 1806.\n\nSent to Ireland and then Ferrol in 1803 and 1804, Fremantle was given the massive 98-gun HMS \"Neptune\" in May 1805 and attached to the Cadiz blockade, ready for Nelson's assumption of command later that year. At the Battle of Trafalgar that October, \"Neptune\" was third in Nelson's division. He cut the Combined Fleet shortly after HMS \"Victory\" did, and ploughing past the wrecked \"Bucentaure\" engaged the massive \"Santissima Trinidad\". The fighting left \"Neptune\" with 44 casualties and the outnumbered Spanish ship with over 300. Relatively undamaged, \"Neptune\" was able to tow the shattered \"Victory\" back to Gibraltar and Fremantle profited by taking the chapel silver from the big Spanish ship, which he used to adorn his home.\n\nFremantle spent the next five years in England, as a member of Parliament for Sandwich 1806–1807 and a Lord of the Admiralty (1806–1807), before being posted rear-admiral and taking command in the Adriatic Sea, where he employed the frigate squadrons under him successfully against French-held Italy and Dalmatia. When the French empire surrendered in 1814, the entire Balkan coast surrendered to him with over 800 ships, netting Fremantle a vast fortune. For his services he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 12 April 1815, as well as a baron of the Austrian Empire and later a vice-admiral and, from 1818, the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. He also received several Austrian and Italian knighthoods and initiation into the Royal Guelphic Order of Hanover. Fremantle died in December 1819 from a sudden illness and was buried at Naples, where his grave can be seen in the Garden of Don Carlo Califano outside the gate of San Gennaro, Naples.\n\nHe had at least four sons; the eldest, Thomas was a politician and succeeded to his father's baronetcy on his death. He was later made Baron Cottesloe for his own services to England. Another son, Charles Fremantle, became the captain of the 26-gun frigate , the first ship to arrive in a fleet of three ships sent out from Britain to establish a colony at the Swan River in Western Australia. The Australian city of Fremantle is named after him. A third son, William Robert Fremantle, was the Dean of Ripon while his youngest son, Stephen Grenville Fremantle, was captain of from 1853 to 1858.\n\n\n\n<br>of the Austrian Empire\n"}

After graduation, she worked as a program analyst at the University of Guelph and then as a Sessional Instructor in computer science at Simon Fraser University. She married Douglas Hayes June 13, 1970.\n\nHer election victory in 1993 came over the incumbent, Ian Waddell of the New Democratic Party, and challenger Celso Boscariol, B.C. president of the Liberal Party of Canada. As one of 52 Reform MPs, she served as Chair of the party's Family Caucus and critic on Human Rights and Status of Women. She was assistant critic for Health (1995-'96) and Human Resources (1997), and a member of the Standing Committees on Health (1994-'97), Citizenship and Immigration (1994-'96) and Human Rights (1996-'97), and of the sub-Committee on HIV/AIDS (1994-'96). While in office, Hayes joined many of her Reform colleagues in donating 10% of their salary to charity and opting out of the MP pension plan.\n\nHayes was best known as a socially conservative advocate for family issues. She crafted the RPC's response to parliamentary initiatives on family and the definition of family, age of consent, Child Care Tax Credit, corporal punishment and the Unified Family Court. She was an advocate for the rights of the disabled, and prompted a change to the compassionate airfare policy for Air Canada. Hayes also sponsored a rally in 1994 in Coquitlam of an estimated 2,000 persons to press for changes to the Young Offenders Act.\n\nShe was a member of the Canadian Delegation to the Fourth UN Conference for Women in Beijing in 1995, but left early to protest what she called (in an essay published in the Globe and Mail on Sept. 15, 1995) the conference's pre-ordained, anti-family agenda. She had also stirred controversy for issuing a press release on her House of Commons letterhead calling on Liberal ministers attending the conference to reject \"Chinese government policies that endorse the mandated one-child policy, the murder of inmates for body parts and the alleged consumption of human fetuses as health food.\" Writing on her personal blog in 2011, Hayes apologized to anyone who had been offended by the release, noting, \"Thankfully, there has been no evidence of the truth of that story since that time.\" She explained that she had not intended for the release to be made public, and, \"In no way did I intend to discredit any nationality or group of people then or since.\"\n\nHayes was also a speaker at the First World Congress of Families, organized by the Howard Center for Family, Religion & Society, in Prague in 1997. She was appointed co-chair of the RPC's Family Campaign, along with Chuck Stahl, leading up to the 1997 general election. Even though her husband, Doug, was in a coma from a massive brain hemorrhage when the election was called and she was able to campaign very little, she was reelected. However, she resigned four months later to care for her ailing husband after his condition deteriorated. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Opposition Leader Preston Manning, Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, and NDP spokesman Bill Blaikie all praised her in the House following her resignation announcement.\n\nHusband, Douglas Charles Hayes (October 15, 1945 to May 26, 2013) was memorialized at Willingdon Church Burnaby on June 3, 2013.\n\nShe has two daughters and seven grandchildren. A past board member at Trinity Western University and Focus on the Family Canada, Hayes currently sits on the board of Affordable Housing Societies.\n"}

The song is featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 remake House of Wax and played in end credits.\n\n\"Helena\" was released to radio on March 8, 2005. The single has become a moderately-selling hit, both in the US and internationally. Way stated in an interview with Channel V that the main influence behind \"Helena\" was from the song \"Aces High\" by Iron Maiden and tracks by The Ventures. This song is also My Chemical Romance's sixth overall single. Way described it as representing the band's image and sound, and as such it was often used to end the band's shows. The single was certified as a Gold record in United States. Despite charting lower than their prior hit, \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\" on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart peaking at number four where \"Helena\" peaked at number 11, \"Helena\" was the band's first crossover hit crossing over to Top 40 radio at number 33 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and it also still had more airplay on alternative rock stations.\n\n\"NME\" declared that the song was one of the \"20 Greatest Goth Tracks\" and that it was \"a pivotal moment in cross-fertilising goth with emo\" and that \"MCR spawned a hybrid that ensured black clothes and eyeliner became, once again, teenage rebellion's default setting\".\n\nThe music video was shot on-location in the Immanuel Presbyterian Church on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, directed by Marc Webb, and choreographed by Michael Rooney. The video has a simple plot, with Gerard Way as a very emotional mourner at a funeral where the band is performing. There are also mourners who dance and mourn the death of Helena. Near the end, the dead body of Helena (played by actress and dancer Tracy Phillips) rises and dances down the nave representing crossing over into the afterlife. After she falls back into the casket, the pallbearers (also played by My Chemical Romance and a fan named Cameron) carry the casket to the hearse (in the pouring rain), surrounded by a phalanx of dancing men and women with umbrellas.\n\nThough the song in general is about the band members Gerard Way and Mikey Way's late grandmother, it was stated in an interview that the video told a different story. The music video shows the funeral of a girl, who, according to Gerard Way, died tragically (possibly in a car crash, with the line in the bridge of the song, \"When both our cars collide.\" Which also has links to the final track on I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love which is follows the story of the Demolition Lovers who are travelling in car “And I would drive on to the end with you” which the story also follows in Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.) The sixth pallbearer and the majority of the mourners are fans who'd received emails from the band asking if they'd like to be in the video.\n\nDuring the \"Making of...\" video, found as a bonus on the \"Life on the Murder Scene\" CD and DVD, it was noted that Frank Iero, while joking about being \"4'9\"\", didn't actually carry any weight of the casket, and that it rested on the other band members and their sixth pallbearer to carry the weight. Also noted was that the rain used in the sequence between the church and the hearse wasn't planned for, but the director used it to his advantage, as it set the mood of a funeral.\n\nThe video was nominated for five \"Moonmen\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Rock Video, Best Choreography, Best New Artist, and the MTV2 and Viewer's Choice Awards (both of which are chosen by viewers). They lost to bands such as Green Day, Fall Out Boy, and The Killers. Though the band did not win any awards, they did do a surprise performance of the song towards the end of the show. They also won an MTV Video Music Awards Latin America \"tongue\" for the Best New Artist – International. They also won a Best Video award in the 2005 \"Kerrang!\" Awards. In November 2005, the video was nominated for two MTVU Woodie Awards (voted on by college students) and won the Woodie of the Year. In the Philippines, Helena has reached a cult-like status because of the popularity of alternative music.\n\nThe video was also voted number one by viewers of MTV Latinamerica in the 2005 \"100 Most Wanted Videos\" and was named the seventeenth best music video of the 21st century since 2000 by \"Billboard\" on July 24, 2018.\n\nThe video was uploaded to YouTube on October 22, 2006 and currently has 100 million views as of November 16, 2019.\n\n"}

The requirement is fundamental to patent law: a monopoly is granted for a given period of time in exchange for a disclosure to the public how to make or practice the invention.\n\nThe disclosure requirement lies at the heart and origin of patent law. An inventor, or the inventor's assignee, is granted a monopoly for a given period of time in exchange for the inventor disclosing to the public how to make or practice their invention. If a patent fails to contain such information, then the bargain is violated, and the patent is unenforceable or can be revoked.\n\nArticle 83 of the European Patent Convention states that an application must \"disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art\". Sufficiency is considered by the examiner during examination of a patent application and the requirement of Article 83 must be complied with in order for a patent to be granted. Insufficient disclosure is also a ground for opposition under .\n\nFor instance, an insufficiency of disclosure might arise if references to standardisation documents are provided to support essential aspects of the invention, but if these references are not sufficiently precise so that \"the skilled person would have to make ... undue efforts to find and get together the information it needs to carry out the invention\".\n\nInsufficiency is also a ground for revocation under Section 72 of the UK Patents Act.\n\nUnder the patent law in the United States, the patent specification must be complete enough so that a person of \"ordinary skill in the art\" of the invention can make and use the invention without “undue experimentation\". There is no precise definition of \"undue experimentation\". The standard is determined based on the art of the invention.\n\nIn the \"predictable arts\", such as mechanical inventions and software inventions, very little description is required. A mere flow chart of a piece of software, for example, is adequate. Source code is not normally required. In the “unpredictable arts”, such as chemistry and pharmaceuticals, a very complete description is required.\n\nIn a 2005 U.S. court case, several of Jerome H. Lemelson patents covering bar code readers were held to be invalid because the specification was not complete enough for a person of ordinary skill in the art of electrical engineering to have made and used the claimed invention at the time the patent was filed (1954) without undue experimentation. In this case the court held that a person of ordinary skill in the art was a degreed electrical engineer with two years of experience as of the filing date of the original patent application, 1954. One of the challenges of this court case, which was decided in 2005, was to find experts on the state of the art who were alive in 1954.\n\nIn the United States, the sufficiency of disclosure requirement is complemented by an additional requirement, generally not found in other national patent jurisdictions: the \"best mode requirement\". According to the requirement, the disclosure must also contain the inventor's \"best mode\" of making or practising the invention. For example, if an inventor knows that a liquid should be heated to 250 degrees for optimal performance, but discloses in the patent that the liquid should be heated to \"above 200 degrees\", then the inventor has not disclosed his \"best mode\" for carrying out the invention. The best mode must be disclosed for the entire invention, and not only its innovative aspects.\n\nThe purpose of the “best mode” requirement is to ensure full disclosure, such that the inventor may not “disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself.”\n\nThe \"best mode requirement\" only applies to what the inventor knows at the time the application is filed, not to what is subsequently discovered.\n\nPost-AIA, US law no longer permits invalidation of a US patent for failure to disclose the best mode, although technically the best mode is still required to be disclosed by the language of 35 U.S.C. Section 112.\n\nThe patent law in the United States requires, among other things, that the patent specification \"contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same.\" 35 U.S.C. 112(1).\nThe requirement \"to enable\" a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention is colloquially referred to as the \"enablement\" requirement. It is a key part of the patent \"bargain\"--an inventor gets a monopoly in return for teaching the world about their invention. A patentee who claims more than they enable is not holding up their side of the bargain: they are taking advantage of patent law's monopoly while keeping their invention secret.\n\nA patent \"enables\" the invention if it allows a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention. Patents may fail this test if they claim more than they teach--for example, a patent that claims all light bulbs but that only explains how to make a particular type of light bulb.\n\nA patent that does not meet the enablement requirement may be declared invalid in whole or in part by a court or upon re-exam. Enablement is determined as of the filing date of the patent, and patent-owners cannot use experiments conducted post-application to establish the validity of their patents.\n\nInventors who do not wish to teach the world about their invention still have some protection under trade secret law, which protects valuable secrets from being misappropriated through unfair means (such as theft or industrial espionage). But unless inventors apply for a valid, enabling patent, they cannot take advantage of patent law's monopoly rights, and thus cannot stop competitors from developing the same product or process through proper means (such as independent invention or reverse engineering). Enablement is the price an inventor pays for this stronger protection.\n\nIn the United States, the would-be patentee must provide a \"written description\" of the invention, sufficient to demonstrate that they actually possessed the invention at the time of filing. \"Written description\" determines the scope of claims.\n\nThe purpose of this rule is to avoid applicants speculatively filing for patents for inventions that they have not yet invented in order to get priority over competitors. Without this requirement, an applicant might delay scientific and technical progress by blocking competitors from inventing something that the applicant has not yet invented. The written description requirement thus reinforces the idea that patents are a reward for inventing by requiring the applicant to show they possess the invention.\n\nThis issue often arises where a patent over-claims--for example, attempting to claim an entire genus of products while only describing one or two of its component species. This would only demonstrate that the inventor had actually invented the narrower species, not the whole genus. Patent law's goal of advancing technological progress would be thwarted if the inventor could shut off competition in other species within the genus that they had not actually invented.\n\n\n\n"}

Its name came from the independent union Solidarity.\n\nAccording to the Round Table Agreement, 35%, i.e. 161 out of 460 seats in the so-called \"Contract Sejm\" (\"Sejm kontraktowy\"), the lower house of the Polish parliament, were to be allocated by a free election. In the run-up to the election, the Citizens' Committee decided to nominate as many candidates in each constituency as there were seats democratically available. The Round Table Agreement also included the restoration of a less powerful upper house of parliament, the Senate, which had been abolished in 1946, to accommodate the opposition's demand for parliamentary representation. The new senate was to have 100 seats, all of which were to be allocated in a free election. The Citizens' Committee nominated a candidate for each seat.\n\nIn its campaigning, the Citizens' Committee relied on its \"Electoral Paper\" \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", and election posters printed mostly unofficially by an extensive network of samizdat print shops, which had been operating throughout the 1980s. Every candidate had an article in \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" and posters showing them with the figurehead of the opposition, Wałęsa. There were other motifs too, most famously perhaps the minimalist \"High Noon\" poster billing the election as the ultimate showdown between the government and the people.\n\nHeld in two ballots on 4 and 18 June, the election resulted in a landslide victory of the opposition organised in the Citizens' Committee, which won all 161 seats available to it in the Sejm, and 99 out of 100 seats in the senate. The one remaining senate seat was won by independent candidate Henryk Stokłosa. The Committee's candidates won by a large margin in all constituencies, frequently receiving more than 90% of the votes.\n\nIndependent, non-Committee candidates obtained a total of 40% of all votes not cast for the ruling Polish United Workers' Party and its affiliates. Even in this historic \"showdown\" election, the turnout was merely 62% in the first and 26% in the second ballot and low turnouts have remained a problem in all Polish elections since.\n\nOn 25 August 1989, the new \"Contract Sejm\" elected the Civil Committee's candidate Tadeusz Mazowiecki as Prime Minister, making him the first ever non-Communist head of government east of the Iron Curtain whereas the presidency remained in the hands of the ruling party.\n\nAs the Committee was not a typical political party but a rather spontaneously formed, loose organisation to facilitate and focus the opposition's pre-election efforts, it did not survive its own triumph for long. On 23 June 1989, the Committee candidates which found themselves in the Sejm formed the Citizens' Parliamentary Party (\"Obywatelski Klub Parlamentarny\", OKP), which elected Bronisław Geremek as chairman.\n\nHowever, political frictions soon occurred within the OKP. Eventually, two rival factions emerged from the OKP and its political milieu, namely a more conservative and populist wing which formed the party Centre Agreement (\"Porozumienie Centrum\", PC) on 12 May 1990 led by Lech Kaczyński whereas the more liberal, \"intellectual\" wing represented by Geremek went on to form their own party called Citizens' Movement for Democratic Action (\"Ruch Obywatelski Akcja Demokratyczna\", ROAD) which later evolved into the Democratic Union (\"Unia Demokratyczna\", UD), Freedom Union (\"Unia Wolności\", UW) and most recently the Democratic Party (\"Partia Demokratyczna\" (PD), also known as \"demokraci.pl\". The split between Solidarity's conservative and liberal heirs became evident in the 1990 presidential election, when the conservatives supported Wałęsa while the liberals nominated Mazowiecki as their own candidate. This cleavage continues to shape the Polish political landscape until this day.\n"}

He studied at Harvard University and after graduating in 1899, Haseltine went to Munich Academy in Germany to study drawing and then to the Académie Julian in Paris, France where he studied painting.\n\nAfter his first piece of sculpture met with success, he pursued that artistic avenue. Inspired by the gathering of artists from around the world to the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, Haseltine chose to make Paris his home for the next thirty-five years until the German occupation of France during World War II. He moved to the United States where he remained until 1947, at which time he returned to France.\n\nHaseltine sculpted a variety of animals but is best known for his equestrian sculptures, most notably the 1934 life-size statue of the thoroughbred race horse Man o' War at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky and \"George Washington on Horseback\", Gilded bronze statue at the Washington National Cathedral made in 1959. He also traveled to India, where he made an oversized statue of one of the ancestors of the Maharaja of Nawanagar, Jam Shri Rawalji in 1933. It can still be seen there. He replicated many of his large works in table-top sizes. The author of a number of books on animalier art, Haseltine was well connected in American upper class society and did a three-year project to create a work for heiress Barbara Hutton. This project included two horses heads which were gilded bronze, with precious and semi precious stones. After her death the heads disappeared and resurfaced a few years ago at an auction in New York.\n\nDuring the time he lived in Paris at the Impasse Raffet (XVIeme Quartier) near the Rue Jasmin, he led a very colourful life. Attached to American Embassy, Paris, 1914-1915, Decorated Chevalier Legion of Honor in 1922, he entertained a lot of guests in his beautiful house, which was once depicted in the French Magazine \"Maison & Jardin\". Amongst his guests were Arthur Rubinstein, Cary Grant, Teddy Roosevelt Jr and Charles Lindbergh. He also had a lot of contacts to highest Russian Royalty. His wife, the former Madeleine Keith, was born in England and died in 1979 in Paris. The house was subsequently sold to the owner of Paris Match. His daughter Helen Heather Haseltine married an Austrian Count by the name of Paul Maria Prosper Toggenburg (b. 09-04-1904 in Trento, d.02-07-1964 in Ritten, Trentino-Südtirol, Italy) so becoming Gräfin Toggenburg, her descendants live in Italy and Austria now. By his son, William Marshall, he has two grandchildren, of which one, Carla, is a well-respected sculptor in her own right.\n\nHerbert Haseltine died in Paris, in 1962. He was buried at the Protestant Cemetery Caius Cestius in Rome, where are also the graves of his parents, of his brothers Stanley Lane, Charles Marshall and his sister Mildred princess Rospigliosi.\n\n\n\n"}

Its lexis, or vocabulary, can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the comparative method of historical linguistics, in the same manner as Proto-Indo-European or PIE, the ancient language which has been most thoroughly re-constructed. Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European language and is itself the ancestor of the Celtic languages which are members of the modern Indo-European language family, the most commonly spoken language family. Modern Celtic languages share common features with Italic languages that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient Italo-Celtic branch. The duration of the cultures speaking Proto-Celtic was relatively brief compared to PIE's 2,000 years. The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe c.1300 BCE. By the Iron Age Hallstatt culture of around 800 BC these people had become fully Celtic.\n\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken, by necessity relying on later iterations of Celtic languages. Although Continental Celtic presents much substantiation for Proto-Celtic phonology, and some for its morphology, recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of syntax, although some complete sentences are recorded in the Continental Gaulish and Celtiberian. Therefore, the primary sources for reconstruction come from the Insular Celtic languages with the oldest literature found in Old Irish and Middle Welsh, dating back to authors flourishing in the 6th century CE.\n\nThe phonological changes from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Celtic may be summarised as follows. The changes are roughly in chronological order, with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list.\n\nThese changes were shared by several other Indo-European branches.\n\nThe following sound changes are shared with the Italic languages in particular, and are cited in support of the Italo-Celtic hypothesis.\n\nOne change shows non-exact parallels in Italic: the vocalization of syllabic resonants next to laryngeals depending on the environment. Similar developments appear in Italic, but for the syllabic nasals *m̥, *n̥, the result is Proto-Italic *əm, *ən (> Latin \"em\" ~ \"im\", \"en\" ~ \"in\").\n\n\n\nThe following consonants have been reconstructed for Proto-Celtic:\nIn contrast to the parent language, Proto-Celtic does not use aspiration as a feature for distinguishing phonemes. So the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops *, *, * merged with *, *, *. The voiced aspirate labiovelar * did not merge with *, though: plain * became * in Proto-Celtic, while aspirated * became *. Thus, PIE * 'woman' became Old Irish \"ben\" and Old Welsh \"ben\", but PIE * 'to kill, to wound' became Old Irish \"gonaid\" and Welsh \"gwanu\".\n\nProto-Indo-European * was lost in Proto-Celtic, apparently going through the stages * (as in the table above) and * (perhaps attested by the toponym Hercynia if this is of Celtic origin) before being lost completely word-initially and between vowels. Adjacent to consonants, Proto-Celtic * underwent different changes: the clusters * and * became * and * respectively already in Proto-Celtic. PIE * became Old Irish \"s\" (lenited \"f-\", exactly as for PIE *) and Brythonic \"f\"; while argues there was an intermediate stage * (in which * remained an independent phoneme until after Proto-Insular Celtic had diverged into Goidelic and Brythonic), finds it more economical to believe that * remained unchanged in PC, that is, the change * to * did not happen when * preceded. (Similarly, Grimm's law did not apply to \"*p, t, k\" after *\"s\" in Germanic, and later the same exception occurred again in the High German consonant shift.)\n\nIn Gaulish and the Brythonic languages, a new * sound has arisen as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European * phoneme. Consequently, one finds Gaulish \"petuar[ios]\", Welsh \"pedwar\" \"four\", compared to Old Irish \"cethair\" and Latin \"quattuor\". Insofar as this new fills the space in the phoneme inventory which was lost by the disappearance of the equivalent stop in PIE, we may think of this as a chain shift.\n\nThe terms P-Celtic and Q-Celtic are useful when we wish to group the Celtic languages according to the way they handle this one phoneme. However a simple division into P- and Q-Celtic may be untenable, as it does not do justice to the evidence of the ancient Continental Celtic languages. The large number of unusual shared innovations among the Insular Celtic languages are often also presented as evidence against a P-Celtic \"vs\" Q-Celtic division, but they may instead reflect a common substratum influence from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland, or simply continuing contact between the insular languages; in either case they would be irrelevant to Celtic language classification in the genetic sense.\n\nQ-Celtic languages may also have in loan words, though in early borrowings from Welsh into Primitive Irish was used by sound substitution due to a lack of a phoneme at the time:\nGaelic \"póg\" \"kiss\" was a later borrowing (from the second word of the Latin phrase \"osculum pacis\" \"kiss of peace\") at a stage where \"p\" was borrowed directly as \"p\", without substituting \"c\".\n\nThe Proto-Celtic vowel system is highly comparable to that reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European by Antoine Meillet. The following monophthongs have been reconstructed:\n\nThe following diphthongs have also been reconstructed:\n\nThe morphology (structure) of nouns and adjectives demonstrates no arresting alterations from the parent language. Proto-Celtic is believed to have had nouns in three genders, three numbers and five to eight cases. The genders were the normal masculine, feminine and neuter, the three numbers were singular, plural and dual. The number of cases is a subject of contention: while Old Irish may have only five, the evidence from Continental Celtic is considered rather unambiguous despite appeals to archaic retentions or morphological leveling. These cases were nominative, vocative, accusative, dative, genitive, ablative, locative and instrumental.\n\nNouns fall into nine or so declensions, depending on the stem. There are *\"o\"-stems, *\"ā\"-stems, *\"i\"-stems, *\"u\"-stems, dental stems, velar stems, nasal stems, *\"r\"-stems and *\"s\"-stems.\n\n\nE.g. *\"ɸlāmā\" 'hand' (feminine) (Old Irish \"lám\"; Welsh \"llaw\", Cornish \"leuv\", Old Breton \"lom\")\n\nE.g. *\"wolkās\" 'hawker' (masculine) (Gallic Latinised \"Volcae\")\n\nE.g. *\"sūlis\" 'sight, view, eye' (feminine) (Brittonic \"sulis\" ~ Old Irish \"súil\")\n\nE.g. *\"mori\" 'body of water, sea' (neuter) (Gallic \"Mori\"- ~ Old Irish \"muir\" ~ Welsh \"môr\")\n\nE.g. *\"bitus\" 'world, existence' (masculine) (Gallic \"Bitu\"- ~ Old Irish \"bith\" ~ Welsh \"byd\" ~ Breton \"bed\")\n\nE.g. *\"dānu\" 'valley river' (neuter?)\n\nBefore the *-\"s\" of the nominative singular, a velar consonant was fricated to *-\"x\" : *\"rīg\"- \"king\" > *\"rīxs\". Likewise, final *-\"d\" devoiced to *-\"t\"-: *\"druwid\"- \"druid\" > *\"druwits\".\n\nE.g. *\"rīxs\" 'king' (masculine) (Gallic -\"rix\"; Old Irish \"rí\"; Middle Welsh \"rhi\", Old Breton \"ri\")\n\nE.g. *\"druwits\" 'druid' (masculine) (Gallic \"druis\"; Old Irish \"druí\"; Middle Welsh \"dryw\" \"druid; wren\", Old Cornish \"druw\")\n\nE.g. *\"karnuxs\" 'carnyx' (masculine?)\n\nE.g. *\"karants\" 'friend' (masculine) (Gallic \"carant\"-; Old Irish \"cara\"; Welsh \"câr\" \"kinsman; friend\", pl. \"ceraint\", Breton \"kar\" \"relative\", pl. \"kerent\")\n\nGenerally, nasal stems end in *-\"on\"-; this becomes *-\"ū\" in the nominative singular: *\"abon-\" \"river\" > *\"abū.\"\n\nE.g. *\"abū\" 'river' (feminine) (Welsh \"afon\", Breton (obs.) \"aven\", Scottish Gaelic \"abhainn\")\n\nE.g. *\"anman\" 'name' (neuter) (Gaulish \"anuan\"-; Old Irish \"ainm\"; Breton \"anv\"; Welsh \"enw\")\n\nGenerally, *\"s\"-stems end in *-\"es\"-, which becomes *-\"os\" in the nominative singular: *\"teges\"- 'house' > *\"tegos\".\n\nE.g. *\"tegos\" 'house' (masculine), Old Irish \"teg, tech\", dative \"tigh\"; Welsh \"tŷ\", Breton \"ti\".\n\n\nE.g. *\"ɸatīr\" 'father' (masculine)\n\nE.g. *\"mātīr\" 'mother' (feminine)\n\nFrom comparison between early Old Irish and Gaulish forms it seems that Continental and Insular Celtic verbs were to develop differently and so the study of Irish and Welsh may have unduly weighted past opinion of proto-Celtic verbal morphology. It can be inferred from Gaulish and Celtiberian as well as Insular Celtic that the proto-Celtic verb had at least three moods:\nand four tenses:\nA probable optative mood also features in Gaulish (\"tixsintor\") and an infinitive (with a characteristic ending \"-unei\") in Celtiberian.\n\nVerbs were formed by adding suffixes to a verbal stem. The stem might be thematic or athematic, an open or a closed syllable.\n\nScholarly reconstructions may be summarised in tabular format.\n\n\n\nProto-Celtic is mostly dated to roughly 800 BC (Hallstatt C), see Celtic languages. The word for 'iron', traditionally reconstructed to Proto-Celtic as \"*īsarnom\", in particular, has long been taken as an indication that the divergence into individual Celtic languages did not start until the Iron Age (the 8th century BC at the latest), but Schumacher and Schrijver have proposed to date Proto-Celtic as early as the 13th century BC, the time of the Canegrate culture, in northwestern Italy, and the Urnfield culture in Central Europe, implying that the divergence may have already started in the Bronze Age.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nThe Leiden University has compiled etymological dictionaries of various IE languages, a project supervised by Alexander Lubotsky and which includes a Proto-Celtic dictionary by Ranko Matasović. Those dictionaries published by Brill in the Leiden series have been removed from the University databases for copyright reasons.

It is 113 kilometres long.\n\nThe Cains River has its origins in the \"Bantalor Wildlife Management Area\" in the eastern part of York County, near the boundary with Sunbury County. Generally flowing northeast through heavy forests, the Cains River joins the Southwest Miramichi River at the community of Howard. The Southwest Miramichi River then joins the Northwest Miramichi River at Newcastle, forming the Miramichi River and becomes tidal.\n\nMuch of the upper Cains River flows through crown land, owned and managed by the provincial government, and therefore cannot be purchased for private use. It is public water and therefore can be used by any fisherman. The Cains River is classified as salmon water from the mouth to the North Cains and requires a guide for non-resident anglers.\n\nThe river is noted for Atlantic Salmon fishing, especially in the autumn. It is a noted trout river as well. A popular fly pattern originated for the dark, tannin-stained waters of the Cains is the Copper Killer. Some of the best pools in the lower Cains River are private water and care must be used here. There is some public water on the lower Cains River, but access can be difficult and use of a licensed fishing guide is encouraged to avoid trespassing.\n\nSalmon fishing is usually best there after a heavy fall rain raises the water level and causes pods of large salmon to begin to move up the Cains River in search of their spawning beds.\n\n"}

For most of the year, it is blocked by sea ice (fast ice) and drift ice made up of multiple ice floes.\n\nThe nutrient-rich cold waters found in the basin are known to be especially favourable to phytoplankton and the numerous islands within it are important bird habitats, including Sabine's gulls and many types of shorebirds. bowhead whales migrate to the northern part of the basin each summer.\n\nThe basin takes its name from the English explorer Luke Foxe who entered the lower part in 1631.\n\nFoxe Basin is a broad, predominantly shallow depression, generally less than in depth, while to the south, depths of up to occur. The tidal range decreases from in the southeast to less than in the northwest. During much of the year, landfast ice dominates in the north, while pack ice prevails towards the south. Foxe Basin itself is rarely ice-free until September, open pack ice being common throughout the summer. Vigorous tidal currents and strong winds keep the ice pack in constant motion and contribute to the numerous polynyas and shore leads which are found throughout the region. This same motion, combined with the high sediment content of the water makes the sea ice of Foxe Basin dark and rough, easily distinguishable from other ice in the Canadian Arctic.\n\nFoxe Basin is connected to the Gulf of Boothia via the narrow Fury and Hecla Strait, and to Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait via the wide Foxe Channel. It is also connected to Repulse Bay and Roes Welcome Sound via Frozen Strait.\n\nThe terrain is rocky and rugged in the southern half of the region, and generally low-lying in the north. High cliffs are found across the southern portion of the region, where most of the seabirds nest. Coastal marshes and tidal flats up to in width are found in the vast lowland section of eastern Foxe Basin, as well as in the bays of Southampton Island.\n\nThis is one of the little-known areas of the Canadian Arctic, though it is proving to be biologically rich and diverse. The numerous polynyas in northern Foxe Basin support high densities of bearded seals and the largest walrus herd in Canada (over 6,000 individuals). Ringed seal and polar bear are common, with north Southampton Island as one of the highest-density polar bear denning areas in Canada.\n\nThis area is also an important summering area for the bowhead whale, beluga whale and narwhal. Both bowhead whales and belugas winter in the waters of northeastern Hudson Bay. Bowheads were the only known baleen whales to occur in the Hudson Bay, but recently some other species of whale, such as humpback and minke, are confirmed to migrate into the waters as well.\n\nThe region is the main North American stronghold of the Sabine's gull, with some 10,000 pairs nesting here. Moderate numbers of black guillemots, Arctic terns and glaucous, herring and ivory gulls also breed here. The Great Plain of the Koukdjuak on Baffin Island is the world's largest goose nesting colony, with upwards of 1.5 million birds, 75 percent of which are lesser snow geese and the remainder Canada and brant geese. Shorebirds and ducks are also abundant. Several hundred thousand thick-billed murres breed on the cliffs of Digges Sound and Coats Island to the south.\n\nThis region is not yet represented in the national marine conservation areas system. Studies to identify preliminary representative marine areas have yet to be undertaken.\n\n"}

{"id": "1950396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950396", "title": "Druzhba pipeline", "text": "Druzhba pipeline\n\nThe Druzhba pipeline (; also has been referred to as the Friendship Pipeline and the Comecon Pipeline) is the world's longest oil pipeline and one of the biggest oil pipeline networks in the world. It carries oil some from the eastern part of European Russia to points in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany. The network also branches out into numerous pipelines to deliver its product throughout Eastern Europe and beyond. The name \"Druzhba\" means \"friendship\", alluding to the fact that the pipeline supplied oil to the energy-hungry western regions of the Soviet Union, to its \"fraternal socialist allies\" in the former Soviet bloc, and to western Europe. Today, it is the largest principal artery for the transportation of Russian (and Kazakh) oil across Europe.\n\nOn 18 December 1958, the 10th session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), held in Prague, adopted a decision and an agreement was signed on construction of a trunk crude oil pipeline from the USSR into Poland, Czechoslovakia, GDR and Hungary. The construction of the initially proposed long pipeline commenced in 1960. Each country was to supply all necessary construction materials, machinery and equipment. Czechoslovakia received first oil in 1962, Hungary in September 1963, Poland in November 1963, and the GDR in December 1963. The whole pipeline was put into operation in October 1964. The first oil pumped through the Druzhba pipeline originated from the oil fields in Tatarstan and Samara (Kuybyshev) Oblast. In the 1970s, the Druzhba pipeline system was further enlarged with the construction of geographically parallel lines.\n\nThe pipeline begins at Almetyevsk in Tatarstan, the Russian heartland, where it collects oil from western Siberia, the Urals, and the Caspian Sea. It runs to Mozyr in southern Belarus, where it splits into a northern and southern branch. The northern branch crosses the remainder of Belarus across Poland to Schwedt in Germany. It supplies refineries in Płock and in Schwedt. The northern branch is also connected by the Płock–Gdańsk pipeline with the Naftoport terminal in Gdańsk, which is used for oil re-exports. In Schwedt, the Druzhba pipeline is connected with the MVL pipeline to Rostock and Spergau.\nThe southern branch runs south through Ukraine. In Brody, the Druzhba pipeline is connected with the Odessa-Brody pipeline, which is currently used to ship oil from the Druzhba pipeline to the Black Sea. In Uzhgorod, the pipeline splits into lines to Slovakia (Druzhba-1 — original Druzhba route) and to Hungary (Druzhba-2). The line through Slovakia is divided once again near Bratislava: one branch leading in a northwest direction to the Czech Republic and the other going southward to Hungary. The Druzhba-1 pipeline branches off toward Hungary in Banská Bystrica Region (Slovakia) near the river of Ipeľ, crosses the Hungarian border at Drégelypalánk and leads to Százhalombatta (not depicted on the map at the beginning of the page). In Hungary, the Druzhba-1 pipeline supplies the Duna refinery while Druzhba-2 supplies Duna and Tisza refineries.\n\nThe ORLEN Lietuva in Lithuania and Ventspils oil terminal in Latvia are connected to the main pipeline by the branch pipeline from the Unecha junction in Bryansk Oblast (not shown on the map). This branch has ceased operation in 2006 and is not likely to become operational again any time soon.\n\nThe part of the Druzhba pipeline system which runs via Belarus is long. The length of the pipeline in Ukraine is , in Poland , in Hungary , in Lithuania , in Latvia , and in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic together around . The pipeline crosses 45 major rivers as well as 200 railways and highways.\n\nThe pipes for the project were manufactured in the Soviet Union and Poland, while fittings were manufactured in Czechoslovakia. The GDR was responsible for pumps, and Hungary for automation and communication equipment. The construction cost nearly 400 million rubles and nearly 730,000 tons of pipe was laid throughout the path of the pipeline.\nThe Druzhba pipeline currently has a capacity of . Work is currently underway to increase this in the section between Belarus and Poland. The pipe diameter of the pipeline varies from . It uses 20 pumping stations.\n\nThe Russian part of the pipeline is operated by the oil company Transneft through its subsidiary OAO MN Druzhba. The operator in Belarus is Gomeltransneft Druzhba, in Ukraine UkrTransNafta, in Poland PERN Przyjazn SA, in Slovakia Transpetrol AS, in the Czech Republic Mero, and in Hungary MOL.\n\nThe Baltic Pipeline System-2 (BPS-2) is a pipeline from the Unecha junction of the Druzhba pipeline near the Russia–Belarus border to the Ust-Luga oil terminal at the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland with a long branch line to Kirishi oil refinery. The throughput capacity of BPS-2 is 50 million tonnes of oil annually. The construction of the BPS-2 started on 10 June 2009. The BPS-2 was completed in 2011 and began to function in late March 2012.\n\nThere have been proposals to the extend northern branch of the Druzhba pipeline towards the German North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven, which would reduce oil tanker traffic in the Baltic Sea and make it easier to transport Russian oil to the United States. In 2007, German Oil Trading GmbH (GOT) proposed to build a connection from Unecha to Wilhelmshaven with a possible branch to Polish and German oil refineries. The proposed connection would be long and would have a capacity of 25 million tonnes of oil a year, which could be increased to 50 million tonnes.\n\nThe Druzhba–Adria Pipeline Integration Project was a proposal that was considered in the 2000s to extend the pipeline to pass through Hungary and Croatia to reach the Adriatic Sea at the deep-water port of Omišalj. In the first phase, the Croatian portion of the Adria pipeline would be reconstructed from the Sisak pumping station to Omišalj harbour. The Croatian company JANAF was responsible for the design of the initial project phase, to reverse the phases of the Adria pipeline (which currently carries oil from the port inland) on the Sisak-Omišalj portion.\n\nIt was also proposed to connect Druzhba Adria with the planned Pan-European Pipeline.\n\nThe proposal was touted by the Croatian president Stipe Mesić, but it also garnered a lot of negative press due to complaints from the environmentalist groups such as Eko Kvarner, and was eventually abandoned.\n\nThe Schwechat–Bratislava two-way oil pipeline project was proposed in 2003. It would allow to supply the OMV owned Schwechat Refinery from the Druzhba pipeline.\n\nFor the last several years, Russia and Ukraine have been tied up in transit fee disputes as the major pipelines supplying Europe with Russian oil and gas run through Ukraine. The continuous disputes were primarily based on transit of natural gas. \nOn December 28, 2009, referring to Russia's announcement, Slovakian government said Russia issued warnings that it would stop oil supplies to Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic over a transit fees dispute with Ukraine. However, the next day, Ukraine's Naftogas issued a statement confirming that Russia agreed to a 30 percent increase in the transit fees through Ukraine. The alleged rise in the tariff will be from $7.8 to $9.50 (or €6.6) per tonne of oil for transiting Ukraine in 2010, and this was implemented due to the decision from the Russian side to raise prices of the energy resources. Additionally, unlike previous payments, new payments will be made in Euros, as this was one of Ukraine's demands. Also, Ukraine needs substantial investments to update the network on its territory as the pipeline grows older. Russia and Ukraine also agreed on the volume of oil to be transported through Ukraine. The overall amount of oil to be transported to Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary through Ukraine in 2010 will be 15 million tonnes, a decrease from 17.1 million tonnes in 2008.\n\nThe delivery of oil was halted on 20 April 2019 due to high concentrations of organic chloride found in the pipeline. These chemical compounds contaminated the pipeline and equipment in Russia and Europe causing an economic impact of billions of dollars. Investigation into the scandal is ongoing with individuals being detained in Russia suspected of having stolen oil and pouring in organochloride to the pipeline to cover up the theft.\n\nDisputes over payment for contaminated oil were ongoing a month later.\n\nBy late May, a month after the contamination was discovered, Russia agreed to take back some of the 8-9m tons of contaminated oil remaining in the pipeline.\nEstimates of overall contaminated stock, including that still in the pipeline and other stock pumped to tankers or to storage range from 20-40m tons as of end May. This stock will all require dilution before it can be refined.\n\nBy the 9th of June Belarus announced that it had cleaned up its sector of the pipeline, returning 450,000 tons to Russia in the process, and that limited flow across the Poland border had resumed at a rate of 65,000 tons a day, the normal rate before the contamination was discovered was 145,000 tons a day. Projections were that full capacity would be reached again by July 2019.\n\nIn mid September 2019, almost 5 months after the contamination was noticed, the Polish pipeline operator confirmed their section of the pipeline had been cleared of contamination and was operating normally. 450,000 Tons of Contaminated Oil had been moved to storage.\n\nAlso in September 2019 oil companies BP and Total were trying to sell 2.3m Barrels (over 300,000 tons) of tainted oil that they had received earlier from the pipeline.\n\nIn February 2020, Belarus threatened to take oil from the Druzhba pipeline if Russia did not supply it with the required volumes of crude oil. Russian oil supplies to Belarus have not been agreed for 2020 and shipments have dwindled to 500,000 tonnes, down from a planned 2 million tonnes. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Moscow hinted at an energy supply deal in exchange for Belarus merging with Russia, which caused talks to collapse.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1950415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950415", "title": "Pierre Auger Observatory", "text": "Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory is an international cosmic ray observatory in Argentina designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: sub-atomic particles traveling nearly at the speed of light and each with energies beyond 10 eV. In Earth's atmosphere such particles interact with air nuclei and produce various other particles. These effect particles (called an \"air shower\") can be detected and measured. But since these high energy particles have an estimated arrival rate of just 1 per km per century, the Auger Observatory has created a detection area of —the size of Rhode Island, or Luxembourg—in order to record a large number of these events. It is located in the western Mendoza Province, Argentina, near the Andes.\n\nConstruction began in 2000, the observatory has been taking production-grade data since 2005 and was officially completed in 2008. The northern site was to be located in southeastern Colorado, United States and hosted by Lamar Community College. It also was to consist of water-Cherenkov detectors and fluorescence telescopes, covering the area of 10,370 km—3.3 times larger than Auger South.\n\nThe observatory was named after the French physicist Pierre Victor Auger. The project was proposed by Jim Cronin and Alan Watson in 1992. Today, more than 500 physicists from nearly 100 institutions around the world are collaborating to maintain and upgrade the site in Argentina and collect and analyse the measured data. The 15 participating countries shared the $50 million construction budget, each providing a small portion of the total cost.\n\nFrom outer space, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays reach Earth. These consist of single sub-atomic particles (protons or atomic nuclei), each with energy levels beyond 10 eV. When such a single particle reaches Earth atmosphere, it has its energy dissipated by creating billions of other particles: electrons, photons and muons, all near the speed of light. These particles spread longitudinally (perpendicular to the single particle incoming route), creating a forward moving plane of particles, with higher intensities near the axis. Such an incident is called an \"air shower\". Passing through the atmosphere, this plane of particles creates UV light, invisible to the human eye, called the fluorescing effect, more or less in the pattern of straight lightning traces. These traces can be photographed at high speed by specialised telescopes, called Fluorescence Detectors, overlooking an area at a slight elevation. Then, when the particles reach the Earth's surface, they can be detected when they arrive in a water tank, where they cause visible blue light due to the Cherenkov effect. A sensitive photoelectric tube can catch these impacts. Such a station is called a water-Cherenkov Detector or 'tank'. The Auger Observatory has both types of detectors covering the same area, which allows for very precise measurements.\n\nWhen an air shower hits multiple Cherenkov Detectors on the ground, the direction of the ray can be calculated using basic geometrics. The longitudinal axis point can be determined from the \"densities\" in each affected ground station. Depending on the \"time difference\" of impact places, the angle of the axis can be determined. Only when the axis would be vertical, all ground detectors register at the very same moment in time, and any tilting of the axis will cause a time difference between earliest and latest touchdown.\n\nCosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess. He measured a difference in ionisation at different heights (using the Eiffel tower and a Hess-manned hot air balloon), an indication of the atmospheric thinning (so \"spreading\") of a single ray. Influence of the Sun was ruled out by measuring during an eclipse. Many scientists researched the phenomenon, sometimes independently, and in 1937 Pierre Auger could conclude in detail that it was a single ray that interacted with air nuclei, causing an electron and photon air shower. At the same time, the third particle muon was discovered (behaving like a very heavy electron).\n\nIn 1967 University of Leeds had developed a water-Cherenkov detector (or \"surface station\"; a small water basin, 1.2 m deep; also called \"tank\") and created a 12 km detection area Haverah Park using 200 such tanks. They were arranged in groups of four in a triangular (Y) ground pattern, the triangles in different sizes. The observatory worked for 20 years, and produced the main design parameters for the ground detection system at Auger Observatory. It was Alan Watson who in the later years led the research team and subsequently co-initiated Auger Observatory Collaboration.\n\nMeanwhile, from the Volcano Ranch (New Mexico, 1959–1978), the Fly's Eye (Dugway, Utah) and its successor the High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector called \"HiRes\" or \"Fly's Eye\" (University of Utah), the technique of the fluorescence detector was developed. These are optical telescopes, adjusted to picture UV light rays when looking over a surface area. It uses faceted observation (hence the fly's eye reference), to produce pixeled pictures at high speed. In 1992, James Cronin led the research and co-initiated the Auger Observation Collaboration.\n\nIn 1995 at Fermilab, Chicago, the basic design was made for the Auger observatory. For half a year, many scientists produced the main requirements, and a cost estimation, for the projected Auger. The observatory's area had to be reduced from 5000 km to 3000 km.\n\nWhen construction began, a full-scale prototype was set up first: the Engineering Array. This array consisted of the first 40 ground detectors and a single fluorescence detector. All were fully equipped. The engineering array operated for 6 months in 2001 as a prototype; it was later integrated into the main setup. It was used to make more detailed design choices (like which type of photomultiplier tube (PMT) to use, and tank water quality requirements) and to calibrate.\n\nIn 2003, it became the largest ultra-high energy cosmic ray detector in the world. It is located on the vast plain of Pampa Amarilla, near the town of Malargüe in Mendoza Province, Argentina. The basic set-up consists of 1600 water Cherenkov Detectors or 'tanks', (similar to the Haverah Park experiment) distributed over , along with 24 atmospheric Fluorescence Detector telescopes (FD; similar to the High Resolution Fly's Eye) overseeing the surface array.\n\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory is unique in that it is the first experiment that combines both ground detectors and fluorescence detectors at the same site thus allowing cross-calibration and reduction of systematic effects that may be peculiar to each technique. The Cherenkov detectors use three large photomultiplier tubes to detect the Cherenkov radiation produced by high-energy particles passing through water in the tank. The time of arrival of high-energy particles from the same shower at several tanks is used to calculate the direction of travel of the original particle. The fluorescence detectors are used to track the particle air shower's glow on cloudless moonless nights, as it descends through the atmosphere.\n\nTo support the atmospheric measurements (FD measurements), supporting stations are added to the site:\n\nResearch and development was done on new detection techniques and ( to ) on possible upgrades to the observatory, including:\n\nAugerPrime is a major upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory under construction since 2019:\n\nAll these enhancements aim at increasing the measurement accuracy of the Pierre Auger Observatory, in particular for the mass of the primary cosmic-ray particles.\nThe observatory has been taking good-quality data since 2005 and was officially completed in 2008.\n\nIn November 2007, the Auger Project team announced some preliminary results. These showed that the directions of origin of the 27 highest-energy events were correlated with the locations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A subsequent test with a much larger data sample revealed however that the large degree of initially observed correlation was most probably due to a statistical fluctuation.\n\nIn 2017, data from 12 years of observations enabled the discovery of a significant anisotropy of the arrival direction of cosmic rays at energies above formula_1. This supports that extragalactic sources (i.e. outside of our galaxy) for the origin of these extremely high energy cosmic rays (see Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray).\nHowever, it is not yet know what type of galaxies are responsible for the acceleration of these ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. This question remains under investigation with the AugerPrime upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory.\nThe Pierre Auger Collaboration has made available (for outreach purposes) 1 percent of the ground array events below 50 EeV (10 eV). Higher energy events require more physical analysis and are not published this way. The data can be explored at the Public Event Display web site.\nArgentina issued 100,000 postage stamps honouring the observatory on 14 July 2007. The stamp shows a surface detector tank in the foreground, a building of fluorescence detectors in the background, and the expression \"10 eV\" in large lettering.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1950418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950418", "title": "New Thought", "text": "New Thought\n\nThe New Thought movement (also Higher Thought) is a movement that developed in the United States in the 19th century, considered by many to have been derived from the unpublished writings of Phineas Quimby. There are numerous smaller groups, most of which are incorporated in the International New Thought Alliance. The contemporary New Thought movement is a loosely allied group of religious denominations, authors, philosophers, and individuals who share a set of beliefs concerning metaphysics, positive thinking, the law of attraction, healing, life force, creative visualization, and personal power.\n\nNew Thought holds that \"Infinite Intelligence\", or God, is everywhere, spirit is the totality of real things, true human selfhood is divine, divine thought is a force for good, sickness originates in the mind, and \"right thinking\" has a healing effect. Although New Thought is neither monolithic nor doctrinaire, in general, modern-day adherents of New Thought share some core beliefs:\n\nWilliam James used the term \"New Thought\" as synonymous with the \"Mind cure movement\", in which he included many sects with diverse origins, such as idealism and Hinduism. The teachings of Christian Science are in some ways similar to Quimby's teachings. Its founder, Mary Baker Eddy, was a student and patient of Quimby's but she later disavowed his influence on her Christian Science.\n\nWilliam James, in \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\", described New Thought as follows:\nThe New Thought movement was based on the teachings of Phineas Quimby (1802–1866), an American mesmerist and healer. Quimby had developed a belief system that included the tenet that illness originated in the mind as a consequence of erroneous beliefs and that a mind open to God's wisdom could overcome any illness. \nHis basic premise was:\nDuring the late 19th century, the metaphysical healing practices of Quimby mingled with the \"Mental Science\" of Warren Felt Evans, a Swedenborgian minister.\nMary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, has sometimes been cited as having used Quimby as inspiration for theology. Eddy was a patient of Quimby’s and shared his view that disease is rooted in a mental cause. Because of its theism, Christian Science differs from the teachings of Quimby.\n\nIn the late 19th century, New Thought was propelled by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the Unity Church and Church of Divine Science (established in 1889 and 1888, respectively), followed by Religious Science (established in 1927). Many of its early teachers and students were women; notable among the founders of the movement were Emma Curtis Hopkins, known as the \"teacher of teachers\", Myrtle Fillmore, Malinda Cramer, and Nona L. Brooks; with many of its churches and community centers led by women, from the 1880s to today.\n\nNew Thought is also largely a movement of the printed word.\n\nPrentice Mulford, through writing \"Your Forces and How to Use Them\", a series of essays published during 1886–1892, was pivotal in the development of New Thought thinking, including the Law of Attraction. \n\nIn 1906, William Walker Atkinson (1862–1932) wrote and published \"Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World\". Atkinson was the editor of \"New Thought\" magazine and the author of more than 100 books on an assortment of religious, spiritual, and occult topics. The following year, Elizabeth Towne, the editor of \"The Nautilus\", published Bruce MacLelland's book \"Prosperity Through Thought Force\", in which he summarized the \"Law of Attraction\" as a New Thought principle, stating \"You are what you think, not what you think you are.\"\n\nThese magazines were used to reach a large audience then, as others are now. \"Nautilus\" magazine, for example, had 45,000 subscribers and a total circulation of 150,000. One Unity Church magazine, \"Wee Wisdom\", was the longest-lived children's magazine in the United States, published from 1893 until 1991. Today, New Thought magazines include \"Daily Word\" published by Unity and the Religious Science magazine, \"Science of Mind\", published by the Centers for Spiritual Living.\n\nThe 1915 International New Thought Alliance (INTA) conference – held in conjunction with the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, a world's fair that took place in San Francisco – featured New Thought speakers from far and wide. The PPIE organizers were so favorably impressed by the INTA convention that they declared a special \"New Thought Day\" at the fair and struck a commemorative bronze medal for the occasion, which was presented to the INTA delegates, led by Annie Rix Militz. By 1916, the International New Thought Alliance had encompassed many smaller groups around the world, adopting a creed known as the \"Declaration of Principles\". The Alliance is held together by one central teaching: that people, through the constructive use of their minds, can attain freedom, power, health, prosperity, and all good, molding their bodies as well as the circumstances of their lives. The declaration was revised in 1957, with all references to Christianity removed, and a new statement based on the \"inseparable oneness of God and Man\".\n\nThe chief tenets of New Thought are:\n\n\nAdherents also generally believe that as humankind gains greater understanding of the world, New Thought itself will evolve to assimilate new knowledge. Alan Anderson and Deb Whitehouse have described New Thought as a \"process\" in which each individual and even the New Thought Movement itself is \"new every moment\". Thomas McFaul has claimed \"continuous revelation\", with new insights being received by individuals continuously over time. Jean Houston has spoken of the \"possible human\", or what we are capable of becoming.\n\nThe Home of Truth has, from its inception as the Pacific Coast Metaphysical Bureau in the 1880s, under the leadership of Annie Rix Militz, disseminated the teachings of the Hindu teacher Swami Vivekananda. It is one of the more outspokenly interfaith of New Thought organizations, stating adherence to \"the principle that Truth is Truth where ever it is found and who ever is sharing it\". Joel S. Goldsmith's The Infinite Way incorporates teaching from Christian Science, as well.\n\nDivine Science, Unity Church, and Religious Science are organizations that developed from the New Thought movement. Each teaches that Infinite Intelligence, or God, is the sole reality. New Thought adherents believe that sickness is the result of the failure to realize this truth. In this line of thinking, healing is accomplished by the affirmation of oneness with the Infinite Intelligence or God.\n\nJohn Bovee Dods (1795–1862), an early practitioner of New Thought, wrote several books on the idea that disease originates in the electrical impulses of the nervous system and is therefore curable by a change of belief. Later New Thought teachers, such as the early-20th-century author, editor, and publisher William Walker Atkinson, accepted this premise. He connected his idea of mental states of being with his understanding of the new scientific discoveries in electromagnetism and neural processes.\n\nWhile the beliefs that are held by practitioners of the New Thought movement are similar to many mainstream religious doctrines, there have been concerns raised \n\n[from here forth, discussion relates to said concerns, yet are presented as fact with few citations. This should be a separate section/subsection, ala \"criticism\"] \n\namong scholars and scientists about some of the views surrounding health and wellness that are perpetuated by the New Thought movement. Most pressing is the New Thought movement’s rejection of empirically supported scientific theories of the causes of diseases. In scientific medicine, diseases can have a wide range of physical causes, from abnormalities in genes and in cell growth that cause cancer, to viruses, bacteria, and fungi that cause infections, to environmental toxins that can damage entire organ systems, human physical diseases are caused by physical issues. While it has been empirically supported that the psychological and social health of a person can influence their susceptibility to disease (e.g., stress can suppress immune function, which increases risk of infection), mental states are not the cause of human disease, as is claimed by the New Thought movement.\n\nEqually concerning is the New Thought movement’s emphasis on using faith and mental states as treatments for all human disease. While it has been supported that the use of relaxation therapy and other forms of alternative health practices are beneficial in improving the overall well-being of patients suffering from a wide variety of mental and physical health conditions (e.g., cancer, post-traumatic stress disorder), these practices are not effective in treating human disease alone, and should be undertaken in conjunction with modern medical therapies that have empirical support. This rejection of scientifically supported theories of disease and disease treatment is worsened by the New Thought movement’s assertion that mental states, attitudes, and faith in New Thought are the sole determinants of health.\n\nThe New Thought movement has received criticism akin to that levied against the holistic health movement that in claiming that sickness is caused by a person’s attitudes, mental states, and faith, it is easy to place blame on patients for not adopting a correct attitude, thought processes, and/or lifestyle. Blame can have powerful psychological effects – with stress and isolation seen in victim blaming being the largest issues that arise and the most concerning in terms of effect on patients’ health. Further, holding beliefs that health and disease is controlled by faith in a higher power can create an external locus of control (i.e., believers may feel as though they themselves cannot prevent disease, and that any illness or disorder that they encounter is an act of the higher power’s will). This external locus of control can create learned helplessness in believers that has been shown to exacerbate mental and physical health conditions via several mechanisms – including reduced incidence of help-seeking behaviour. Overall, the New Thought movement's position on the etiology and treatment of disease is not empirically supported.\n\nNew Thought publishing and educational activities reach approximately 2.5 million people annually. The largest New Thought-oriented denomination is the Japanese Seicho-no-Ie. Other belief systems within the New Thought movement include Jewish Science, Religious Science, Centers for Spiritual Living and Unity. Past denominations have included Psychiana and Father Divine.\n\nReligious Science operates under three main organizations: the Centers for Spiritual Living; the Affiliated New Thought Network; and Global Religious Science Ministries. Ernest Holmes, the founder of Religious Science, stated that Religious Science is not based on any \"authority\" of established beliefs, but rather on \"what it can accomplish\" for the people who practice it. \"The Science of Mind\", authored by Ernest Holmes, while based on a philosophy of being \"open at the top\", focuses extensively on the teachings of Jesus Christ. The American Christian Church International and its theological school, the Arnulf Seminary of Theology, are also deeply influenced by the ideology of the New Thought movement.\n\nUnity, founded by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, identifies itself as \"Christian New Thought\", focused on \"Christian idealism\", with the Bible as one of its main texts, although not interpreted literally. The other core text is \"Lessons in Truth\" by H. Emilie Cady. The \"Universal Foundation for Better Living\", or \"UFBL\", was founded in 1974 by Johnnie Colemon in Chicago, Illinois after breaking away from the Unity Church for \"blatant racism\".\n\n\n"}

International Business Machines Corp.\n\nWallace v. International Business Machines Corp., 467 F.3d 1104 (7th Cir. 2006), was a significant case in the development of free software. The case decided, at the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, that in United States law the GNU General Public License (GPL) did not contravene federal antitrust laws.\n\nDaniel Wallace, a United States citizen, sued the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for price fixing. In a later lawsuit, he unsuccessfully sued IBM, Novell, and Red Hat. Wallace claimed that free Linux prevented him from making a profit from selling his own operating system.\n\nIn 2005, Daniel Wallace filed suit against the FSF in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, stating that the GPL, by requiring copies of computer software licensed under it to be made available freely, and possibly even at no cost, is tantamount to price fixing. In November 2005 the case was dismissed without prejudice, and Wallace filed multiple amended complaints in an effort to satisfy the requirements of an antitrust allegation. His fourth and final amended complaint was dismissed on March 20, 2006, by Judge John Daniel Tinder, and Wallace was ordered to pay the FSF's costs. In its decision to grant the motion to dismiss, the Court ruled that Wallace had failed to allege any antitrust injury on which his claim could be based, since Wallace was obligated to claim not only that he had been injured but also that the \"market\" had. The Court instead found that\nThe Court also noted that prior cases have established that the Sherman Act was enacted to assure customers the benefits of price competition, and have emphasized the act's primary purpose of protecting the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market. This decision thus supports the right of authors and content creators to offer their creations free of charge.\n\nIn 2006, Daniel Wallace filed a lawsuit against the software companies IBM, Novell, and Red Hat, who profit from the distribution of open-source software, specifically the GNU/Linux operating system. Wallace's allegation was that these software companies were engaging in anticompetitive price fixing.\n\nOn May 16, 2006, Judge Richard L. Young dismissed the case with prejudice:\n\nWallace later filed an appeal in the Seventh Circuit Appeal Court, where his case was heard \"de novo\" in front of a three-judge panel led by Frank Easterbrook.

It was first produced in 1942 as a medium artillery piece under the designation of 155 mm Howitzer M1. It saw service with the US Army during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, before being replaced by the M198 howitzer.\n\nThe gun was also used by the armed forces of many nations. In some countries, the M114A1 still remains in service.\n\nA new carriage was under development for much of the 1930s for the existing World War I-era M-1918 155 mm howitzer, which was a license-built French Canon de 155 C modèle 1917 Schneider until 1939 when it was realized that it did not seem logical to put a new carriage underneath an obsolete howitzer. So development began anew with a carriage designed to be used for either the 155 mm howitzer or the gun. This was completed by 15 May 1941 when the Howitzer M1 on the Carriage M1 was standardized. The howitzer itself differed from the older model by a lengthened barrel of 20 calibers and a new breech mechanism. Uniquely it was the sole 'slow-cone' interrupted screw mechanism to enter US service after 1920. This meant that two separate movements were necessary to open the breech, versus the single movement of the 'steep cone' mechanism that simultaneously rotated and withdrew the breech.\n\nThe M1A1 was redesignated as the M114A1 in 1962.\n\nThe carriage was also used by the 4.5 inch Gun M-1. It went through a number of minor changes over time. The original Warner electric brakes were replaced by Westinghouse air brakes on the M1A1. Both the M1 and M1A1 carriages used a mid-axle firing pedestal that was extended by a ratchet mechanism. The M1A2 replaced the ratchet with a screw-jack system and also modified the traveling lock. The M1A1E1 carriage was intended for use in jungle and muddy terrain and replaced the wheels of the M1A1 with a free-wheeling tracked suspension, but the project was terminated after V-J day without having reached production. The T-9 and T-10 carriages were projects using low-grade steel alloys that were canceled when no longer needed. The T-16 was a light-weight carriage using high-grade steel that was estimated to save some ; work began in July 1945 and continued after the war, although nothing seems to have come from it.\n\nA mid-1960s variant was the 155mm XM123 & M123A1 auxiliary-propelled howitzers. The XM123 was produced by American Machine and Foundry and outfitted with two 20 horsepower air-cooled engines produced by Consolidated Diesel Corporation, driver's seat, steering wheel, and guide wheel on the left trail, allowing it to be more rapidly emplaced when detached from the prime mover, while the XM123A1 provided a single 20 horsepower motor with electric steering. The extra weight on the left trail displaced the howitzer after each round was fired, requiring it to be realigned, and the project was abandoned. The concept was copied from the Soviet 85mm SD-44 auxiliary-propelled antitank gun developed in 1954 and used by airborne forces.\n\nThe howitzer was experimentally mounted on a lengthened chassis of the M5 light tank. The resulting vehicle received the designation 155 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T64. A single prototype was built before the T64 project was abandoned in favor of T64E1, based on the M24 Chaffee light tank chassis. This was eventually adopted as the M41 Howitzer Motor Carriage and saw action in the Korean War. Towards the end of the Korean War the US Army replaced the M41 self-propelled howitzer with the M44 self-propelled howitzer.\n\nThe gun fires separate-loading, bagged charge ammunition, with up to seven different propelling charges, from 1 (the smallest) to 7 (the largest). Muzzle velocity, range and penetration in the tables below are for maximum charge in form of complete M4A1 propelling charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It ran from 1992 to 1997 on Fox's former Saturday Morning children's block Fox Kids, airing on YTV from 1992 to 1998 in Canada.\n\n\"Eek! the Cat\" is about a purple cat named Eek whose motto is \"it never hurts to help\". This attitude generally gets him into trouble, from which much of the humor of the show is derived. Other characters include Eek!'s human family, with whom he cannot communicate via spoken language; Sharky the Sharkdog (his worst nightmare), and Eek's girlfriend, Annabelle.\n\nThe show featured slapstick humor and pop culture references. Shows vary from standard cartoon fare to movie spoofs (such as \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\") and musical episodes; the first Christmas episode was written almost entirely in rhyme.

It followed Ryan and Wade Heap and their pet Klutter, who they created from a pile of junk because they couldn't have a real dog due to their father's allergies. There are other characters in the show, like Sandee Heap, who was lonely at first, before Klutter came into their lives. They went on mysteries, a la \"Scooby-Doo\", to save animals and solve crimes.\n\nKlutter ended in February 1996 with 8 segments. Unlike Eek! and Thunderlizards, the segment was created by David Silverman and Holland along with being animated by Film Roman.\n\nThe original idea for the show came from Savage Steve Holland's experience as a cat owner. One of his cats was named Eek. In an early design, Eek was colored pink instead of purple. The series was originally titled \"The Six and a Half Lives of Eek the Cat\".\n\nThe show premiered on the now-defunct Fox Kids block in 1992 as \"Eek! The Cat\". Thirteen 20 minute episodes were produced for its first season. A recurring character named Mr. Iwanter was a caricature of then-Fox Kids executive Sid Iwanter.\n\nFor the second season in 1993, the show's format was retooled (except It's A Very Merry Eek's Mas, which originally aired as a prime-time special). In each episode were two nine-minute segments. One was \"Eek! the Cat\". The other was often \"The Terrible Thunderlizards\". The Thunderlizards segments were intended to air at the start of the season, but it began two months later because of production delays. When they started airing, the series title was changed to \"Eek! And The Terrible Thunderlizards\". Also, the creators originally intended to include two one-minute segments. The first would feature the Squishy Bearz, and the second one were to feature other characters from Eek!. However, because the show turned out to be too long, the one-minute segments were scrapped. In January 1994, Fox aired four Thunderlizards segments as two Thunderlizards specials.\n\nDuring the season, Kopp left the show (though he still did the voice of Eek and others) for his own show, \"The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show\" for Disney, which would later own Eek! as well.\n\nFor the third season in 1994, the name was changed once again to \"Eek! Stravaganza\", keeping the same format that was used in the second season.\n\nIn the fall of 1995, another segment called \"Klutter\" was added, rotating with the Thunderlizards. This segment lasted a year. Kato Kaelin was originally scheduled to be a guest voice in an episode, but the Fox network refused.\n\nFox canceled \"Eek! Stravaganza\" in November 1996, though they eventually aired the final episodes in the summer of 1997.\n\nMost episodes of \"Eek! Stravaganza\" were then re-run from August 1998 to April 1999 on Freeform, back when it was called Fox Family.\n\nFor years, all that was available commercially was a single VHS tape with the episodes Catsanova and HawaiiEek 5-0 on it. It was released in 1995. On July 23, 2001, \"Eek!\" and other properties of Saban Entertainment were sold to The Walt Disney Company. As of 2017, no word from Disney has been spoken about releasing the series to DVD in North America. Twelve DVD volumes have been released by Jetix in the Czech Republic under the title \"Kocour Raplík\", another Jetix DVD for Russian markets under the title \"\", and four Hungarian Jetix DVDs under the title \"Nyekk a Macska\".\n\nSeveral episodes of the series used to be available to watch on the ABC Family website and was also seen on the Jetix and Jetix Play channels in some parts of Europe.\n\n\nCelebrities made cameo appearances as themselves on the show, unless otherwise noted. (Also, Bill Kopp and Savage Steve Holland appeared as themselves in the show.)\n\nAn \"Eek! The Cat\" video game was released for the Super NES in 1994.\n\n"}
{"id": "1950488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950488", "title": "Mundkur", "text": "Mundkur\n\nMundkur is a village in Karkala Taluk, Udupi district, Karnataka, India. The Durga Parameshwari temple located here was built circa 9th century AD. \n\nMundkur Maagane contains the three villages of Mundkur, Mulladka and Inna; with its border till Elluru in the North, sankalkareya in the South, Bola in the East and Ulepady in the West. There are Mahalingeshwara Temples in the Four corners of Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple of Mundkur( South East: Posral; South West: Ulepady; North West: Inna Muddannu; North East: Bola Mahalingeshwara temples) which were constructed centuries later. As per available ancient records, in Shaka varsha 1337 (1415 C.E.), (Hevilambi Samvatsara) King Narasimha Banga Raja (Bangas) transferred the administration of MUNDKUR Magane to Chowta Rulers. Mundkur was the Central governing point for any administration, Panchayath(Settlement of disputes), and Discussion venue for these three villages which continues even today. Any function in the three villages were banned between Dwajarohana and Avabritha(Jalaka) in Mundkur Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple, which is observed even today.\n\nLegend has it that Goddess Durga Parameshwari slayed the demon Mundaka here as per Skaanda Puraana and place was named as MUNDAKOORU which became MUNDKUR in later days. The idol was initially installed facing West by Bhargava Rishi as per the request of Suratha Raaja after the prathistha of Sri Raajarajeshwari in Pulinapura, now known as POLALI, before 800 AD. The researcher, Dr.P. Gururaja Bhat has done lot of research about various temples, and estimated the age of the Mahishamardini idol of Mundkur as belonging to early 8th century, the oldest temple in the three villages of Inna, Mundkur, Mulladka, Kadandale, Bola, Ulepaady, Yelinje and other nearby villages, with Royal connections of Banga and Chouta Rulers . During the reconstruction of the temple in 2005/06, the original door frames in western portion of the wall of the sanctum sanctorum was found which has been preserved in the temple premises. Kere Pushkarni is there in the west (even today known as Sri Bhargava Theertha) and Ashwatha Vriksha in the north west. During the Jain rule, King Veeravarma, who was considered as a bad ruler, turned the idol towards east to take out buried riches from underneath the idol. Since then, the idol is facing East.\n\nMundkur Durga is Kuladevi for the Brahmin community of Bhargava Gothra and most of the devotees from GSB, Bunts, Billavaas, Kulaals, Devadigaas and other devotees worship as Mane Devi(Goddess of their original House) and the priests are belonging to Bharadwaja Gothra from the ancient time in Mundkur,Yelinje,Ulepady and Inna. Christians and Muslims worship with flowers and poojas which can be seen even today. Jainpete, ruins of Jain Basadi and palace, Kalkuda and Jattinga Daivaas (Worshiped by the then Jains) can be seen here and Jain community is not living, which is said to be due to the curse of Devi to the bad attitude of earlier Jains and their cruel Ruler Veeravarma who turned the idol from west to east. Jain devotees visit and seek the blessings in different occasions; but, there is no resident Jain family found here. As per Paad-dana(Ancient Tulu Folk Songs) Kanthabaare and Boodabare, Great Heroes of South Kanara District, born in Ulepaady village; were devotees of Mundkur Durga and due to the bad attitude and character of Veeravarma and his followers, they killed him and his bad company. Due to No-Governance, Moodabidre Chowta Rulers have interfiered and reformation took place by them. The administration of the temple was handed over to Brahmins of eight families belonging to Bhargava Gothra, headed by Madmannaya family as Pavithrapaani and Eight Guththus, Four Paraaris, Four Baalikes as supporters on behalf of villagers of Inna, Mundkur, and Mulladka. As a token of love and respect the Chowta King donated lots of land, two Wooden pillars of the single Jack fruit tree, said to be from the Chouta Palace yard (The Biggest and bulky in the District, which can be seen even today) and several precious wooden Logs…. etc. for the temple and the Chowta Queen has donated her precious stone studded ornaments to Durga Devi, which is used for decorating the Main idol in the temple during festivals and special occasions. The Chowta Rulers were visiting the temple during annual car festival under the personal invitation from the Chief of Madmannaya family. The King and his Team used to relax at Sacheriparari, a place in the village border of Mundkur (Stone Cot on which Chowta ruler is said to be using to relax can be seen here even today) and was being received by the villagers at Jarige Katte. The Chowta King used to participate in the final day’s Chendu-aata(Foot Ball Match) of the young villagers followed by Arasara Katte Pooje and Keredeepotsava. From the year 1855AD, visit of Chowta rulers was stopped due to the misunderstanding amongst the villagers and Chief of Madmannaya family and Madmannayas stopped visiting and inviting the Chowta. Even today the Arasara Kattepooje, Keredeepotsav is being celebrated and that day is called as Arasara Bali Utsava day.\n\nThe prime deity is Sri Durgaparameshwari in the form of Mahishamardini, holding the demon Mahisha upside down and piercing thrishul on his body. Hence the name Mundakke oori nintha OOru became Mundkur in the later stage as per one version. Other deities being worshiped are Sri MahaGanapathi (Kshipraprasaada swaroopi), Navagraha, Naaga, AshwaththaVriksha, Dhoomavathi, Raktheshwari, Vyaghra Chamundi(Pilichandi), Vaarahi (Panjurli) and Rakshopi Devatha (Protector from evil Spirits) in the temple. Photos of Sri Madhvacharya, Sri Vadiraja swamiji, Sri Raghavendra Swamiji, and Sri Bhootharaja are installed in Sri Madhva Mandira, where bhajans and poojas are held regularly.\n\nSri Vitoba Rukumayi Temple in Mundkur: \nIn this temple trikal pooja is performed followed by Bhajan keerthans daily during night by the devotees. This temple is built and managed by GSB Community. The founder of this temple was Posral Lakshmana Kamath and his family. Shri Vidyadhiraj Teerth swamiji of Shri Samsthan Gokarn Partagali Jeevottam Math camped for ten day during there Bhajana Centenary in 2014.\n\nPosral Sri Mahalingeshwara temple, Inna Muddannu Sri Mahalingeshwara Temple, Sri Vishnumoorthi Temple in Bailaguthu(Inna), Vyaghra Chamundi in Madmannu, Brahma Baidarkala Garadi and Brahmasthana in Mulladka, Dhoomavathi in Innada Guthu are the nearby places of worship in the vicinity of Mundkur Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple.\n\nIn the north east corner of Mundkur, a place known as Gurumeru can be seen where water flows all the 365 days surrounded by forest and hills, which is said to be the place where Bhargava Gothra saints used for Penance and Meditation during ancient period.\n\nThree and half km away from Mundkur Sri Durga Temple and Two and half km away from Sacheripete where Durga is worshipped as Marikamba. In olden days children belonging to six families worshipped Durga as Marikamba under a big Mango tree. Later this became a legend and was known as Kukkudadi Kaje (Under the Mango Tree). Every Tuesday pooja is done and Devi Pathri Darshana is performed where the woes of devotees are heard by Devi Darshan Pathri and solutions are given which come true. Hundreds of devotees have got their wishes fulfilled and devotees come from far and wide seeking blessings of Maarika Durgaparameshwari.

The devotees offer different sevas including Maaripooja and Special Gaddige Pooja, Flower pooja, Thulabharam, Archana, Chandika Havan, Kadali Havan...etc. Devotees come here from various destinations irrespective of caste and religion including Muslims and Christians in large numbers seeking solutions for their unique woes/problems and it is true that they get blessed within very short period.\n\nThe annual Car-festival happens in the kumbha masa every year which is on 17 or 18 February. Navaratri, Deepotsava are other special days for the goddess. Jalaka (dipping in river shambhavi) takes place on the next day of the car festival.

The top club sides from Africa's football leagues are invited to participate in this competition, which is the premier club football competition in the continent and the equivalent to the UEFA Champions League. Due to sponsorship reasons, the official name is Total CAF Champions League, with Total Champions League also in use.\n\nThe winner of the tournament earns a berth for the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament contested between the champion clubs from all six continental confederations, and also faces the winner of the CAF Confederation Cup in the following season's CAF Super Cup.\n\nEgypt's Al Ahly SC is the most successful club in the competition's history, having won the tournament eight times. Egyptian clubs have accumulated the highest number of victories, winning the title 14 times.\n\nStarting life as the 'African Cup of Champions Clubs' in 1964, the first team to lift the trophy was Cameroonian side Oryx Douala, who beat Stade Malien of Mali 2–1 in a one-off final.\n\nThere was no tournament held the following year, but the action resumed again in 1966, when the two-legged ‘home and away’ final was introduced, which saw another Malian team AS Real Bamako take on Stade d'Abidjan of the Côte d'Ivoire. Bamako won the home leg 3–1 but it all came apart for them in the away game in Abidjan as the Ivorians went on to win 4–1 to take the title 5–4 on aggregate.\n\nIn 1967 when Ghana's Asante Kotoko met the DRC's TP Mazembe, both matches ended in draws (1–1 and 2–2 respectively). CAF arranged a play-off, but the Ghanaians failed to appear and the title was handed to Mazembe, who went on to win the title again the following year.\n\nHowever, the Ghanaians got their revenge in 1970, when Kotoko and Mazembe once again met in the final. Once again, the first game ended 1–1, but against expectation the Ghanaians ran out 2–1 winners in their away game to lift the title that had eluded them three years earlier.\n\nThe 1970s saw a remarkable rise in the fortunes of Cameroonian club football, which created the platform of success enjoyed by Cameroonian football at international level today.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1980 Cameroonian teams won the cup four times, with Canon Yaoundé taking three titles (1971, 1978 and 1980) and US Douala lifting the cup in 1979. In between the Cameroonian victories the honor was shared with another team enjoying a golden age, Guinean side Hafia Conakry, who won it three times during this period (1972, 1975 and 1977).\n\nApart from the introduction of the away goals rule (in which the team wins which has scored more goals playing ‘away’ if there is a tie in the aggregate score line over the two legs), very little changed in this competition until 1997. In this year, CAF took the bold step to follow the lead established a few years earlier in UEFA by creating a league stage in the tournament and changing the name to the CAF Champions League. CAF also introduced prize money for participants for the first time. With a purse of US$1 million on offer to the winners and US$750,000 to the losing finalist, the new Champions League became the richest club competition in Africa.\n\nIn the new format, the league champions of the respective CAF member countries went through a series of preliminary rounds until a last 16 stage. The 8 winners of this round were then drawn into two mini-leagues of 4 teams each, with each team playing each other on a home and away basis. At the end of the league stage, the top two teams in each group meet in the semifinals, with the winners going through to contest the finals. In 2017, the group phase was expanded from 8 to 16 teams and the mini-leagues from 2 to 4 and the addition of one extra knock-out round.\n\nSince its inception, clubs from North Africa have been more dominant in the competition, with nearly 80% of Champions League's title in Africa went to this region. Nonetheless, in 2010, TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of the Congo became the first club ever to repeat as champions on two separate occasions. Their first pair of wins came in 1967 and 1968, before repeating the feat again in 2009 and 2010.\n\nIn 1997 the CAF Champions League replaced the previous pan-African competition, the \"African Cup of Champions Clubs\"; this had run from 1964–1996.\n\nThe competition is open to the winners of all CAF-affiliated national leagues, as well as the holder of the competition from the previous season. From the 2004 competition the runner-up of the league of the 12 highest-ranked countries also entered the tournament creating a 64-team field. This was in response to the merging of the CAF Cup, the secondary pan-African club competition where the league runners-up would previous play, with the CAF Cup Winners' Cup to create the CAF Confederation Cup. The 12 countries would be ranked on the performance of their clubs in the previous 5 years.\n\nThe Champions League operates as a knockout competition, with a final group stage, with each tie (including the final) played over two legs – home and away. There are 2 knockout stages: the preliminary stage and the first round (32 teams). The 16 teams knocked out of the first round are entered into the Confederation Cup to play against the final 16 teams in that competition. After the first round, the last 16 teams are split into four groups of 4. The winner and runner-up in these groups are sent to play in a quarter-final and the possibility to play semi-finals, in chase of victory, for the chance of contesting the final.\n\nIn October 2004, MTN has contracted a four-year deal to sponsor African football's major competitions. This agreement, which worthed US$12.5 million, was the biggest sponsorship deal in African sporting history at that time.\n\nIn July 2009, Orange has signed an eight-year deal to sponsor African football's major competitions. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but CAF previous year put a value of €100 million for a comprehensive and long-term package of its competitions when it opened tenders for a new sponsor. The deal included the African Nations Cup, the CAF Champions League, the CAF Confederation Cup, the CAF Super Cup, the African Nations Championship and the African Youth Championship.\n\nIn July 2016, Total secured an eight-year sponsorship package from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to support ten of its principal competitions, including the Africa Cup of Nations (renamed the Total Africa Cup of Nations).\n\nCurrent Sponsors:\n\nIn 1997, the CAF introduced prize money for the eight participants in group stage for the first time in a club competition in Africa.\n\nIn 2009, the CAF had increased prize money to be shared between the Top 8 clubs as follows:\n\nThe CAF has increased prize money to be shared between the Top 16 clubs starting from 2017 to 2020.\n\nSince the inception, the rising successes of North African football clubs have been subject of criticisms by the clubs from the remaining regions of Africa with controversies surrounding football intimidation and violence by North African supporters, its football style which is accused of not fair-play, and its strong financial muscles which have let the region's clubs to be extremely powerful than the rest of Africa in the competition.\n\n\n"}

A clipped vowel is pronounced more quickly than an unclipped vowel and is often also reduced.\n\nParticularly in Netherlands Dutch, vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened and centralized, which is particularly noticeable with tense vowels; compare the phoneme in (phonemically ) 'rabbit' and (phonemically ) 'king'.\n\nIn weak forms of words, e.g. and , the vowel is frequently centralized: , though further reduction to or is possible in rapid colloquial speech.\n\nMany dialects of English (such as Australian English, General American, Received Pronunciation, South African English and Standard Canadian English) have two types of non-phonemic clipping: pre-fortis clipping and rhythmic clipping.\n\nThe first type occurs in a stressed syllable before a fortis consonant, so that e.g. \"bet\" has a vowel that is shorter than the one in \"bed\" . Vowels preceding voiceless consonants that begin a next syllable (as in \"keychain\" ) are not affected by this rule.\n\nRhythmic clipping occurs in polysyllabic words - the more syllables a word has, the shorter its vowels are, so that e.g. the first vowel of \"readership\" is shorter than in \"reader\", which in turn is shorter than in \"read\".\n\nClipping with vowel reduction also occurs in many unstressed syllables.\n\nBecause of the variability of vowel length, the diacritic is sometimes omitted in IPA transcriptions of English, so that words such as \"dawn\" or \"lead\" are transcribed as and , instead of the more usual and . Neither type of transcription is more correct as both convey exactly the same information, though transcription systems that do use the length mark make it more clear whether a vowel is checked or free - compare the length of the RP vowel in the word \"not\" as opposed to the corresponding in Canadian English, which is typically longer (like RP ) because Canadian is a free vowel (checked is very rare in North America as it relies on a three-way distinction between , and ) and thus can also be transcribed as .\n\nThe Scottish vowel length rule is used instead of those in Scotland and sometimes also in Northern Ireland.\n\nMany speakers of Serbo-Croatian from Croatia and Serbia pronounce historical unstressed long vowels as short, with some exceptions (such as genitive plural endings), so that e.g. the name is pronounced , rather than .\n\n\n"}

It was located in a 2,000-acre (8 km²) woodland on the side of present-day Germantown, Tennessee, a Memphis suburb, along the Wolf River. It was a small-scale test of her full-compensation emancipation plan in which no slaveholders would lose money for emancipating slaves. Instead, Wright proposed that, through a system of unified labor, the slaves would buy their freedom and then be transported to Haiti or the settlements which would become Liberia.\n\nThe commune was to create a demonstration of Wright's emancipation plan: to create a place to educate slaves and prepare them for freedom and colonization in Haiti or Liberia. Wright was strongly influenced by Robert Owen and his utopian community, New Harmony, Indiana. Surviving for three years, Nashoba outlasted New Harmony.\n\nWright first expressed her plan of emancipation in an article called \"A Plan for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in the United States, without Danger of Loss to the Citizens of the South,\" which she published in the \"New Harmony Gazette\" in October 1825. Wright believed that if she could arrange emancipation without financial loss to slaveholders, planters of the South would use it. She believed that slaveholders were \"anxious to manumit their people, but apprehensive about throwing them unprepared into the world.\" Wright imagined that if her experimental community was successful, its methods could be applied throughout the nation.\n\nWright raised funds and recruited people. Among the first were the Englishman George Flower and his family, who had founded another settlement in Albion, Illinois. Wright could not raise sufficient monetary support and ended up using a good portion of her own fortune to buy land and slaves. She called it \"Nashoba,\" the Chickasaw word for \"wolf.\"\n\nNashoba is remembered as an egalitarian, interracial community, but it did not reach these goals. While Wright was a champion of emancipation, the slaves in the community were her property until they could buy themselves out. In \"Revisiting Nashoba,\" Gail Bederman says, \"Nashoba's continued commitment to colonization and fully compensated emancipation meant that its slaves remained both subordinates and, most fundamentally, property.\"\n\nWhen the compensated emancipation plan failed to produce results, Wright turned Nashoba into a kind of utopian community. The white members of the community became the trustees and were responsible for administering the property and making the decisions. The slaves could never become trustees.\n\nWright left Nashoba in 1827 for Europe to recover from malaria. During her absence, the trustees managed the community, but by Wright's return in 1828, Nashoba had collapsed. At its largest, Nashoba had only 20 members.\n\nNashoba is described briefly in Frances Trollope's 1832 book \"Domestic Manners of the Americans\". She visited Nashoba with Wright in 1827 and lived in the United States for a few years. Her work was critical of American society for its lack of polish. She thought residents at Nashoba lacked both sufficient provisions and luxuries.\n\nThe interim managers of Nashoba instigated the concept of free love within the commune. In practice, it was interracial, but far from egalitarian. As rumors spread of inter-racial marriage, the Commune encountered increasing financial difficulty, eventually leading to its collapse in 1828.\n\nBefore Nashoba failed, Wright was returning by ship to America. On her journey, she wrote \"Explanatory Notes Respecting the Nature and Objects of the Institution of Nashoba, and of the Principles upon which it is Founded.\" She elaborated on a notion of Nashoba as an interracial and egalitarian utopia. Her plan outlined in \"Explanatory Notes\" was never put into effect, however; Nashoba had already failed when Wright arrived back in the US. Wright personally chartered a ship and delivered the remaining slaves of Nashoba to Haiti, where she emancipated them.\n\nDespite the failure of Nashoba, it provided an example of working utopian theory. Wright had progressive ideas of liberty and equality for her time, but the burden of leadership and financial hardship proved too much for the community.\n\nIn 1963 Edd Winfield Parks published \"Nashoba\", described as \"a novel about Fanny Wright's gallant utopian experiment to emancipate the slaves\".\n\nThe Twin Oaks Community, founded in 1967, is an intentional community of 100 members in Virginia. All the buildings are named after former communities, and one residence has been named for Nashoba.\n\nAdditionally, the Neshoba Unitarian Universalist Church, founded in 1992 in the area where the commune was located, is named after Nashoba.\n\nThe name Nashoba (sometimes spelled \"Neshoba\") is still used in the Germantown area for place names, such as Neshoba Road running between Kirby Parkway and Kimbrough Road. It was also briefly the name of Germantown during World War II as a sign of \"protest\" against the country of Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

A group of publishers sued the Law Society of Upper Canada for copyright infringement for providing photocopy services to researchers. The Court unanimously held that the Law Society's practice fell within the bounds of fair dealing.\n\nSince 1954 the Law Society of Upper Canada, a statutory, non-profit organization, offered request-based photocopying services to students, members, the judiciary, and authorized researchers at their Great Library at Osgoode Hall. The Law Society provided single copies of legal articles, statutes, and decisions to those who requested them. It also allowed visitors to the Great Library to use photocopiers to make individual copies of works held by the library., \n\nThree of the largest publishers of legal sources, CCH Canadian Limited, Carswell Thomson Professional Publishing and Canada Law Book Inc., sued the Law Society for copyright infringement of 11 specific works based on these activities. They requested relief in the form a declaration of subsistence of copyright in these works and a permanent injunction barring the Great Library from reproducing these works or any other works published by the plaintiffs.\n\nIn response, the Law Society argued that the services it offered were necessary to provide equal access to the library's collection of legal materials. Many of the materials held at the library are non-circulating, which makes access to the original copies difficult to those who do not work near-by. The Law Society sought a declaration that its activities did not infringe on the publishers' copyrights, by either the provision of a single copy of a work or by allowing patrons to avail themselves of the self-service photocopiers.\n\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court was delivered by Chief Justice McLachlin. The Court held that the Law Society did not infringe any copyright when single copies of decisions, statutes, regulations, etc. were made by the library or by its patrons using photocopiers to do similarly.\n\nIn reaching its ruling, the Court needed to rule on four questions:\n\n\nThe Court also considered whether the Law Society infringed on copyrights by providing a fax service, and whether the Great Library qualified under the Library exemption. With respect to these considerations, the Court considered four sub-issues:\n\n\nIn relation to the first issue, the Court looked at what is considered the meaning of \"original work\". Chief Justice McLachlin first remarked that copyright does not protect ideas, but rather their expression. In comparison with the similar US Supreme Court case of \"Feist Publications Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service\", McLachlin rejected Justice O'Connor's \"minimal degree of creativity\" test but agreed with her assessment of the \"sweat of the brow\" approach and found it too low a requirement.\n\nInstead, McLachlin took the middle ground by requiring \"that an original work be the product of an exercise of skill and judgment\" where \"skill\" is \"the use of one's knowledge, developed aptitude or practised ability in producing the work\" and \"judgment\" is \"the use of one's capacity for discernment or ability to form an opinion or evaluation by comparing different possible options in producing the work\". As well, \"[t]he exercise of skill and judgment required to produce the work must not be so trivial that it could be characterized as a purely mechanical exercise.\" Importantly, it is required that the work \"must be more than a mere copy of another work.\" However, \"creativity is not required to make a work 'original'.\"\n\nIn concluding that all eleven works were protected by copyright, she noted that the creation of headnotes, summaries, and topical indices involved sufficient exercise of skill and judgment so as to render them \"original\" works. However, she also noted that the judgments themselves were not copyrightable, nor were the typographical corrections done by the editors sufficient to attract copyright protection.\n\nThe second issue was whether, by providing library patrons with access to photocopiers, the library was implicitly authorizing copyright infringement. McLachlin dismissed this argument by stating that providing access to a machine that could be used to infringe copyright does not suggest sufficient \"authorization\" to violate copyright. It is presumed that a patron with access to the machines would use them lawfully. However the presumption can be rebutted by evidence that shows \"a certain relationship or degree of control existed between the alleged authorizer and the persons who committed the copyright infringement\". The publishers presented no such evidence. The fact that the library posted a notice to patrons stating that photocopiers should not be used to infringe on copyrights was not an acknowledgment that such infringement occurred. Finally, the Law Society did not have direct control of its patrons, as with a master-servant relationship, and therefore could not be said that it exercised control over its patrons.\n\nThe third issue dealt with the scope of \"fair dealing\" and more specifically what constitutes \"research\" under s. 29 of the \"Copyright Act\".\n\nMcLachlin noted that fair dealing was to be regarded as an \"integral part\" of the \"Copyright Act\" rather than \"simply a defence\". The fair dealing exceptions were characterized as a user right, and must be balanced against the rights of copyright owners.\n\nWhen claiming \"fair dealing\" the defendant must show that 1) the dealing was for the purpose of either research or private study and that 2) it was fair.\n\nIn interpreting \"research\" the Court stated that it \"must be given a large and liberal interpretation in order to ensure that users' rights are not unduly constrained.\" Consequently, it is not limited to private and non-commercial contexts. Therefore, the library made the copies for research purposes.\n\nMcLachlin then examined the meaning of \"fair\" in the contexts of \"dealings\". She cited Lord Denning in \"Hubbard v. Vosper\" when he described fair dealing as being a \"question of degree\" that cannot be defined concretely. She followed this by adopting the reasoning of Linden JA, which incorporated English and US views, in defining six factors to determine fairness:\n\n\nIn application of these factors to the facts McLachlin found that, given the restrictions put in place by the Law Society for copying the materials, the library was acting fairly. She also found that the library could rely on its general practice to establish fair dealing, and was not required to show that all patrons used the material in a fair way.\n\nIn referencing \"Théberge v. Galerie d'Art du Petit Champlain inc.\", McLachlin emphasized the importance of balancing \"the public interest in promoting the encouragement and dissemination of works of the arts and intellect and obtaining a just reward for the creator.\" She also clarified that \"fair dealing\" does not provide merely a defense which removes liability, but instead defines the outer boundaries of copyright and grants a right to the user.\n\nGiven her ruling that the Law Society's actions were fair, McLachlin declined answering the fourth issue.\n\nMcLachlin concluded that a single fax transmission to a single recipient was not a \"transmission to the public\" within the meaning of the copyright law.\n\nFor the sale of a copy of copyrighted materials to involve secondary infringement, it must be shown that \"(1) the copy must be the product of primary infringement; (2) the secondary infringer must have known or should have known that he or she is dealing with a product of infringement; and (3) the secondary dealing must be established; that is, there must have been a sale.\" Since McLachlin ruled that the copy was fair and therefore was not a product of primary infringement, the sale of the materials could not involve secondary infringement.\n\n\"In order to qualify as a library, the Great Library: (1) must not be established or conducted for profit; (2) must not be administered or controlled by a body that is established or conducted for profit; and (3) must hold and maintain a collection of documents and other materials that is open to the public or to researchers.\" Since McLachlin already concluded the library's dealings were fair, she did not need to rule on this issue. Regardless, she determined that the Great Library would have qualified for the library exemption.\n\nSince the Great Library was found not to have infringed on copyrighted material, no determination was made as to whether the Court of Appeals was correct in denying injunctive relief.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1950512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950512", "title": "Embedded journalism", "text": "Embedded journalism\n\nEmbedded journalism refers to news reporters being attached to military units involved in armed conflicts. While the term could be applied to many historical interactions between journalists and military personnel, it first came to be used in the media coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The United States military responded to pressure from the country's news media who were disappointed by the level of access granted during the 1991 Gulf War and the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nThe practice has been criticized as being part of a propaganda campaign whereby embedded journalists accompanied the invading forces as cheerleaders and media relations representatives.\n\nAt the start of the war in March 2003, as many as 775 reporters and photographers were traveling as embedded journalists. These reporters signed contracts with the military promising not to report information that could compromise unit position, future missions, classified weapons, and information they might find. Joint training for war correspondents started in November 2002 in advance of start of the war. When asked why the military decided to embed journalists with the troops, Lt. Col. Rick Long of the U.S. Marine Corps replied, \"Frankly, our job is to win the war. Part of that is information warfare. So we are going to attempt to dominate the information environment.\"\n\nThe first journalist to run afoul of U.S. military rules in Iraq was freelancer Philip Smucker, travelling on assignment for the\" Christian Science Monitor \"with the 1st Marine Division. Smucker was not officially embedded, but all reporters in the theater of war were deemed subject to Pentagon oversight. On March 26, 2003, during an interview with CNN, Smucker disclosed the location of a Marine unit, as he'd also done during an interview with NPR. He was thereafter expelled.\n\nJust four days later, Fox News Channel correspondent Geraldo Rivera similarly broadcast details from Iraq of the position and plans of U.S. troops. \"Let me draw a few lines here for you,\" he said, making on-camera marks in the sand. \"First, I want to make some emphasis here that these hash marks here, this is us. We own that territory. It's 40%, maybe even a little more than that.\" At another point, complained a CENTCOM spokesman, Rivera \"actually revealed the time of an attack prior to its occurrence.\" Although Rivera—like Philip Smucker—was not officially embedded, he was swiftly escorted back to Kuwait. A week later, Rivera apologized. \"I'm sorry that it happened,\" he said on Fox News Channel, \"and I assure you that it was inadvertent. Nobody was hurt by what I said. No mission was compromised.\" However, a network review, he admitted, \"showed that I did indeed break one of the rules related to embedment.\"\n\nIn December 2005 the U.S. Coalition Forces Land Component Command in Kuwait pulled the credentials of two embedded journalists on a two-week assignment for the Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, Virginia, claiming they violated a prohibition against photographing damaged vehicles.\n\nThe ethics of embedded journalism are considered controversial. The practice has been criticized as being part of a propaganda campaign and an effort to keep reporters away from civilian populations and sympathetic to invading forces; for example by the documentary films \"\" and \"The War You Don't See\".\n\nEmbed critics objected that the level of military oversight was too strict and that embedded journalists would make reports that were too sympathetic to the American side of the war, leading to use of the alternate term \"inbedded journalist\" or \"inbeds\". \"Those correspondents who drive around in tanks and armored personnel carriers,\" said journalist Gay Talese in an interview, \"who are spoon-fed what the military gives them and they become mascots for the military, these journalists. I wouldn't have journalists embedded if I had any power!... There are stories you can do that aren't done. I've said that many times.\"\n\nOn June 14, 2014, \"The New York Times\" published an opinion piece critical of embedded journalism during both the U.S. military occupation of Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. It was written by PVT Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. Army intelligence analyst known for leaking the largest set of classified documents in American history. At no point during her 2009–10 deployment in Iraq, Manning wrote, were there more than a dozen American journalists covering military operations—in a country of 31 million people and 117,000 U.S. troops. Manning charged that vetting of reporters by military public affairs officials was used \"to screen out those judged likely to produce critical coverage,\" and that once embedded, journalists tended \"to avoid controversial reporting that could raise red flags\" out of fear having their access terminated. \"A result,\" wrote Manning, \"is that the American public's access to the facts is gutted, which leaves them with no way to evaluate the conduct of American officials.\" Manning noted, \"This program of limiting press access was challenged in court in 2013 by a freelance reporter, Wayne Anderson, who claimed to have followed his agreement but to have been terminated after publishing adverse reports about the conflict in Afghanistan. The ruling on his case upheld the military's position that there was no constitutionally protected right to be an embedded journalist.\"\n\nGina Cavallaro, a reporter for the \"Army Times, \"said, \"They’re [the journalists] relying more on the military to get them where they want to go, and as a result, the military is getting smarter about getting its own story told.\" But, she added, \"I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing.\"\n\nDuring both the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were used extensively against U.S.-led Coalition forces, and accounted for the majority of Coalition casualties. Journalists travelling with ground forces were at the same risk. On January 29, 2006, while embedded with the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division, ABC's \"World News Tonight\" co-anchor Bob Woodruff and cameraman Doug Vogt were, together with an Iraqi soldier, seriously injured when their convoy was ambushed near Taji, Iraq, and an IED detonated beneath them. At the time of the attack, Woodruff and Vogt were exposed, standing in the back hatch of their Iraqi mechanized vehicle taping a video log of the patrol.\n\n\n"}

Originally built during the period of the British Raj and reconstructed in 1985 on the site of the original Spencer's department store, it is the oldest shopping mall in India and was one of the biggest shopping malls in South Asia when it was built. It is one of the earliest Grade A commercial projects of the city, which were developed in the second half of the 1990s. As of March 2010, it is the 11th largest mall in the country, with a gross leasable (retail) area of 530,000 sq ft.\n\nSpencer Plaza was built in 1863–1864, established by Charles Durant and J. W. Spencer in Anna Salai, then known as Mount Road, in the Madras Presidency. The property originally belonged to Spencer & Co Ltd. Spencer & Co opened the first department store in the Indian subcontinent in 1895. It had over 80 individual departments. After a few years, Eugene Oakshott, owner of Spencer's, shifted the department store to a new building, which was an example of Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The building was designed by W. N. Pogson. In 1983, the original building was destroyed in a fire.\n\nThe present Spencer Plaza was constructed on the same site, measuring about 10 acres, and was opened in 1991. Spread across a million square feet built in three phases with parking space for 800 cars, the plaza is a major hangout for the people of Chennai. The mall was developed by Mangal Tirth Estate Limited in January 1993.\n\nThe plaza is an eight-storey shopping-cum-office complex of approximately 1.068 million sq ft, consisting of nearly of air-conditioned shopping units and of office units. The shopping arcade is located on the ground, first and second floors in all three phases, and the office units are spread between the fourth and the seventh floors. The car parks are spread over the basement, ground, second and third floors, in addition to double basement parking lots in the third phase of the building.\n\nThe first phase of the building consists of about 300,000 sq ft, including about 125,000 sq ft of centrally air-conditioned shopping space and 100,000 sq ft of office units together with about 75,000 sq ft of service areas. The second phase consists of about 400,000 sq ft, with a provision for about 600 cars at the basement, with shops with various sizes ranging from 300 sq ft to 2,000 sq ft. The third phase covers another 300,000 sq ft. The theme of the third phase is based on colonnaded structure recreating the old Spencer's around a full-height atrium.\n\nThere are over 700 shops in the plaza and over 22,000 people visit the plaza every day, with the number increasing to 40,000 on weekends and to 60,000 on festival days. The complex has three counters to keep track of footfalls. Over 20,000 two-wheelers check into the parking lot on weekends.\n\nBeing a high-rise building, the complex has a wet riser system and electronic fire alarm system installed. The underground sump has a storage capacity of . A ring main surrounds the building from the pump room. Five wet risers run from basement to the second floor and three run from the fourth floor to the seventh floor. These risers are located at strategic points in each floor. The pump room has three pumps, one jockey pump, one main pump with an electric motor and one main pump connected with a diesel engine. The electronic fire detection system comprises smoke detectors and manual call points located in various points in common areas in all floors, sub-stations, electrical rooms, A/C plant and so forth, which are connected to a centralized computer located at the enclosures of the chief security officer. There are also many portable fire extinguishers at each floor in different locations. The rear periphery of the building has fire escape stairs, with fire escape routes displayed with signboards at various points of the building. The car ramps can also be used as fire escape routes. The building has two entrances, one from Binny Road and another from Anna Salai, for fire engines.\n\nFire safety includes a water capacity of 1.2 million litres, fire sprinklers, smoke and heat detection systems and fire extinguishers. The in-house fire department has six firemen per shift.\n\nThe mall hosts major anchor stores such as Westside (spread across 20,000 sq ft) and Landmark (40,000 sq ft), and several local and international brands such as Nike, Adidas, Bata, Regal, Health & Glow, Vummidiars, Van Heusen, Proline, Allen Solly, Florshaim shoes, Lipton, Louis Philippe, Titan, Levi's, Casio, V.I.P. Luggage, Spencer & Co (40,000 sq ft on the ground, first and second floors), Timex Watch Showroom, Swatch, Cookie Man, BPL (Profx), Color Plus, Navigator, Witco, Pantaloons (26,000 sq ft), Arrow, Lee, Music World (now closed), Food World, HSBC, ABN AMRO, American Express, Citibank (65,000 sq ft in second and third phases), First Flight and Du Bowl (16,000 sq ft). McDonald's, the world's largest fast food chain, has established an outlet.\nOn 26 February 2004, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB) established a trade centre at the complex at a cost of 17 million. The Sri Lanka Trade Centre is spread over 20,000 sq ft on the first floor at the third phase of the building. Seventeen frontline Sri Lankan companies display apparel, artificial flowers, confectionaries, footwear and leather products, gems and jewellery, herbal products, light engineering products, porcelain, tableware, Ceylon tea and toys.\n\nOn 4 September 2008, a fire erupted on the first floor of the building's first phase around 10:20 p.m. local time, perhaps due to a short circuit. A garment shop was burned in the incident. With the help of 12 water tenders and 9 fire tenders, the fire was extinguished within 30 minutes, and no casualties were reported. The firemen had easy access to the spot, mainly due to the setback space available inside the building.\n\n"}

Formerly he was a senior writer and investigative reporter with \"The New York Times\", Condé Nast's business magazine, \"Portfolio\", and later was a contributing editor with \"Vanity Fair\" and a senior writer with \"Newsweek\". Eichenwald had been employed by \"The New York Times\" since 1986 and primarily covered Wall Street and corporate topics such as insider trading, accounting scandals, and takeovers, but also wrote about a range of issues including terrorism, the Bill Clinton pardon controversy, Federal health care policy, and sexual predators on the Internet.\n\nEichenwald was born in 1961. He has stated that he is \"Episcopalian with a Jewish father.\" He graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas and Swarthmore College. His extracurricular activities during his time at Swarthmore included being a founding member of \"Sixteen Feet\", an a cappella vocal octet.\n\nDuring his first months of college, Eichenwald sustained a concussion, which was soon followed by noticeable epileptic seizures. Diagnosed with epilepsy in November of his freshman year, he continued to attend school despite repeated grand mal seizures.\n\nAfter having two outdoor seizures on campus, he was dismissed from Swarthmore, in apparent violation of federal law. He contacted the United States Department of Health and Human Services and fought his way back into school, an experience that he has credited with giving him the willingness to take on institutions in his muckraking reporting. He graduated with his class in 1983, receiving a degree in political science, with distinction.\n\nFollowing a year at the Election and Survey Unit at CBS News, Eichenwald joined \"The New York Times\" in 1985 as a news clerk for Hedrick Smith, the paper's chief Washington correspondent. When Smith began writing his book \"The Power Game\", Eichenwald became his research assistant, leaving in 1986 to become associate editor at \"The National Journal\" in Washington. During those years, he was a frequent contributor to \"The New York Times\" op-ed page, writing humorous pieces about political issues.\n\nEichenwald returned to \"The New York Times\" later in 1986 as a news clerk for the national desk in New York, participating in the paper’s writing program for aspiring reporters. By 1988, he had been named \"The New York Times\"’ Wall Street reporter.\n\nHis arrival on Wall Street coincided with the explosion of white collar criminal investigations in finance. He wrote about the stock trading scandals involving speculator Ivan Boesky and junk bond king Michael Milken, as well as the Treasury markets scandal at Salomon Brothers. He also covered the excesses of the takeover era, including the biggest deal of the time, the acquisition of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\nIn 1995, Eichenwald began writing about assorted corporate misdeeds. He wrote a multi-part series for \"The New York Times\", exposing significant deficiencies in the American business of providing kidney dialysis treatments. The series led to a review by the Clinton Administration of ways to create financial incentives to improve quality in dialysis treatment, a focus of Eichenwald’s series. The articles were honored in 1996 with a George Polk Award for excellence in journalism, the first of two that he was awarded.\n\nAfter his dialysis series, he joined with Martin Gottlieb, a health reporter with the newspaper, in a multi-year investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, which at the time was the largest health care company in the world. The investigation, which led to multiple articles in the paper and a criminal investigation of Columbia, and led to significant changes in the way the federal government compensated hospitals, according to Bruce Vladek, then the head of the Medicare program. An article in the magazine \"Content\" cited the work by Eichenwald, Gottlieb and two other reporters as the year’s best public service journalism. Eichenwald received his second Polk award, along with his colleagues, for this work.\n\nIn 1998, Eichenwald was attached to \"The New York Times\"’ senior reporter program. He also teamed with another of the newspaper's reporters, Gina Kolata, for a multi-year investigation into how business interests affect the nation’s system for medical research. The articles explored drug and device testing, and pointed out how the interplay between insurance companies and the courts had prevented the testing of experimental procedures, including the use of bone marrow transplants for the treatment of breast cancer. The articles were credited with driving new policies by American insurance companies that allowed for reimbursement to participants in federally approved medical studies for the treatment of cancer. Eichenwald and Kolata both were honored as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for their work.\n\nWith the explosion of corporate scandals in 2002 – Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen, Tyco and others – Eichenwald reported on the unfolding scandals and becoming a television fixture on such programs as \"Charlie Rose\" and \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" in explaining the meaning of the latest developments. Eichenwald, along with several other \"New York Times\" reporters, was selected as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for his work on the corporate scandals.\n\nIn 2005, he wrote a group of \"New York Times\" articles about online child pornography. One of those articles was about Justin Berry, a then-18 year old who operated pornographic websites featuring himself and other teen males. For this reporting, he received the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism, for \"preserving the editorial integrity of an important story while reaching out to assist his source, Justin Berry, in reporting on Berry’s involvement in child pornography.\" \n\nFive months after publication of the article, Eichenwald and Berry both gave Congressional testimony about online child abuse before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Eichenwald claimed in the testimony that he had stumbled across Berry while reporting on documents that proved to be fraudulent, leaving him believing there was no story but fearful there was a child in danger. \"I began trying to figure out if it was real, not for the purpose of doing a story because truthfully I did not, it did not occur to me there would be a story there,\" Eichenwald testified.\n\nAfter confirming that Berry was a real person in danger, Eichenwald testified, he along with two others launched an effort to rescue the young man. Weeks after that effort had been completed, during which Eichenwald met Berry, Berry contacted him and said he wanted to reveal everything he knew about the online child pornography business for a news article in hopes of \"bringing down\" the illicit enterprise.\n\nIn 2007 it came to light that Eichenwald had given Berry an undisclosed $2,000 before writing the reports; \"The New York Times\" published a note stating that \"the check should have been disclosed to editors and readers\". During his testimony that same day as a prosecution witness against one of Berry's abusers, Eichenwald said he and his wife had used the money as a means of forcing Berry to reveal his identity during the rescue effort. Eichenwald testified that when Berry offered to become a source for a news article, he told the young man that he could not begin any reporting until the financial conflict was resolved by Berry returning the money to him from a lawful source of funds. Eichenwald testified that Berry obtained a loan from his grandmother which he used to repay him in July 2005, at which point the reporting began.\n\nIn the fall of 2006 Eichenwald left \"The New York Times\" and joined the staff of newly created business magazine \"Condé Nast Portfolio\" as a senior writer. He was recruited by Jim Impoco, a former \"New York Times\" editor and managing editor of the new Portfolio. The first edition of the magazine was published in April 2007. However, both Eichenwald and Impoco had a very short tenure at \"Portfolio\". An Eichenwald article about terrorism that had been championed by Impoco was killed by editor-in-chief Joanne Lipman, leading to a significant dispute between the two editors. After several months of tension between them, Lipman fired Impoco in August 2007; Eichenwald resigned on the same day. \"Portfolio\" was not a commercial success, and was closed in April 2009. The failure of such a high-profile project was seen as a major setback for Condé Nast.\n\nIn 2012, Eichenwald joined \"Vanity Fair\" as a contributing editor where he wrote business articles for the magazine and an online column focusing on government and politics. In 2013, while continuing his work for \"Vanity Fair\" he joined \"Newsweek\" as a senior writer. \n\nEichenwald's reporting on Prudential led to his first book, \"Serpent on the Rock\" (1995), which focused primarily on the limited partnership scandal at Prudential Securities, which is alleged to have defrauded 340,000 people out of eight billion dollars. The book was positively reviewed by Kirkus reviews, with a comparison to the bestseller \"Barbarians at the Gate\".\n\nIn 2000, he published his second book, \"The Informant\". While still a business book, \"The Informant\" was much more of a non-fiction police procedural depicting the inner workings of the FBI in detail. The book was subsequently adapted as the feature film a film adaptation. The movie, a dark comedy directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Matt Damon, was released in 2009.\n\nEichenwald’s investigation of Enron led to his third and most successful book, \"Conspiracy of Fools\" (2005). The book made \"The New York Times\" bestseller list in April 2005. The book was marketed as \"a gripping corporate thriller with more plot twists than a John Grisham novel\" by Random House.\nIt was optioned as a movie by Warner Brothers, to potentially star Leonardo DiCaprio. However, the film was never made.\n\nIn 2012, he published his fourth book, \"500 Days\". Also a \"New York Times\" bestseller, the book chronicled the events in governments around the world in the 500 days after the 9/11 attacks. It revealed details of the American program of NSA eavesdropping, torture policy, the American government's briefings on the coming attacks before 9/11, and the details of debates within the British government.\n\nEichenwald's fifth book, A Mind Unraveled, was published in 2018 by Random House. The book is a memoir about medical struggles that almost killed Eichenwald when he was a young man.\n\nEichenwald is a two-time winner of the George Polk Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1995 and 1997, for articles about the dialysis industry and fraud at the nation's largest hospital company, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2000, along with his \"New York Times\" colleague Gina Kolata, for an investigation of medical clinical trials. In 2006, he won the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism and the Best in Business Enterprise Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers.\n\nIn a 1987 article about his illness for \"The New York Times Magazine\", Eichenwald wrote about his epilepsy diagnosis at the age of 18 in 1979:\n\nThe doctor warned me – and so did members of my family soon afterward – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I would be subject to discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.\n\nHis willingness to reveal his personal battle to readers won him praise. He was awarded a journalism prize from the Epilepsy Foundation of America for his 1987 article. In a 2002 \"NewsBios\" article titled \"Kurt Succeeded Where So Many Others Would Have Quit,\" Dean Rotbart wrote:\n\nWhile Eichenwald has never since hidden his epilepsy, he also didn't make it a centerpiece of his life. After writing his story, his mission was clear and it was not to become a poster boy for the illness. \"My whole life from the time I got sick was focused on making sure that I was a student, a journalist, a husband, and a father,\" Kurt tells me. \"Not that I was someone with this condition.\"\n\nIn late 2016 after making critical remarks about Donald Trump, Eichenwald was intentionally sent epileptogenic GIFs over Twitter. He said the second attempt, in mid December following an interview about his Trump claims with Tucker Carlson, succeeded in causing him to have a seizure and that he would be taking a short break from Twitter while he pursued legal action against the user that sent the image. In March 2017, a Maryland man was arrested in connection with the incident and charged with cyberstalking. The federal cyberstalking charge was later dropped, although he still faces one count of aggravated assault, with the tweet being considered \"a deadly weapon.\" The trial of the suspect began on December 16, 2019.\n\nEichenwald is married to Theresa Pearse, an internist. They have three children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1950552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950552", "title": "Wood frog", "text": "Wood frog\n\nThe wood frog (\"Lithobates sylvaticus\" or \"Rana sylvatica\") has a broad distribution over North America, extending from the boreal forest of the north to the southern Appalachians, with several notable disjunct populations including lowland eastern North Carolina. The wood frog has garnered attention by biologists over the last century because of its freeze tolerance, relatively great degree of terrestrialism (for a ranid), interesting habitat associations (peat bogs, vernal pools, uplands), and relatively long-range movements.\n\nThe ecology and conservation of the wood frog has attracted research attention in recent years because they are often considered \"obligate\" breeders in ephemeral wetlands (sometimes called \"vernal pools\") that are themselves more imperiled than the species that breed in them. The wood frog has been proposed to be the official state amphibian of New York.\n\nWood frogs range from in length. Females are larger than males. Adult wood frogs are usually brown, tan, or rust-colored, and usually have a dark eye mask. Individual frogs are capable of varying their color; Conant (1958) depicts one individual when light brown and dark brown at different times. The underparts of wood frogs are pale with a yellow or green cast.\nA small brown frog with a dark eye mask in the woods is likely to be a wood frog. No other species has a similar appearance to the wood frog in North America. The first evasive leap is fast and long. Close observation will often glimpse a second short dive under the leaf litter, making the frog seem to disappear.\nThe contiguous wood frog range is from northern Georgia and northeastern Canada in the east to Alaska and southern British Columbia in the west. It is the most widely distributed frog in Alaska. It is also found in the Medicine Bow National Forest.\n\nWood frogs are forest-dwelling organisms that breed primarily in ephemeral, freshwater wetlands: woodland vernal pools. Long-distance migration plays an important role in their life history. Individual wood frogs range widely (hundreds of meters) among their breeding pools and neighboring freshwater swamps, cool-moist ravines, and/or upland habitats. Genetic neighborhoods of individual pool breeding populations extend more than a kilometer away from the breeding site. Thus, conservation of this species requires a landscape (multiple habitats at appropriate spatial scales) perspective.\nAdult wood frogs spend summer months in moist woodlands, forested swamps, ravines, or bogs. During the fall, they leave summer habitats and migrate to neighboring uplands to overwinter. Some may remain in moist areas to overwinter. Hibernacula tend to be in the upper organic layers of the soil, under leaf litter. By overwintering in uplands adjacent to breeding pools, adults ensure a short migration to thawed pools in early spring. Wood frogs are mostly diurnal and are rarely seen at night, except maybe in breeding choruses. They are one of the first amphibians to emerge for breeding right when the snow melts, along with spring peepers.\n\nWood frogs eat a variety of small, forest-floor invertebrates. Omnivorous, the tadpoles feed on plant detritus and algae, and also attack and eat eggs and larvae of amphibians, including those of wood frogs.\n\nThe feeding pattern of the wood frog, basically similar to that of other ranids, is triggered by prey movement and consists of a bodily lunge that terminates with the mouth opening and an extension of the tongue onto the prey. The ranid tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth near the tip of the jaw, and when the mouth is closed, the tongue lies flat, extended posteriorly from its point of attachment.\n\nIn the feeding strike, the tongue is swung forward as though on a hinge, so some portion of the normally dorsal and posterior tongue surface makes contact with the prey. At this point in the feeding strike, the wood frog differs markedly from more aquatic \"Lithobates\" species, such as the green frog, leopard frog, and bullfrog. The wood frog makes contact with the prey with just the tip of its tongue, much like a toad. A more extensive amount of tongue surface is applied in the feeding strikes of these other frog species, with the result that usually the prey is engulfed by the fleshy tongue and considerable tongue surface contacts the surrounding substrate.\n\nSimilar to other northern frogs that enter dormancy close to the surface in soil and/or leaf litter, wood frogs can tolerate the freezing of their blood and other tissues. Urea is accumulated in tissues in preparation for overwintering, and liver glycogen is converted in large quantities to glucose in response to internal ice formation. Both urea and glucose act as cryoprotectants to limit the amount of ice that forms and to reduce osmotic shrinkage of cells.\n\nFrogs can survive many freeze/thaw events during winter if no more than about 65% of the total body water freezes. Wood frogs have a series of seven amino acid substitutions in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase 1 (SERCA 1) enzyme ATP binding site that allows this pump to function at lower temperatures relative to less cold-tolerant species (e.g. \"Lithobates clamitans\").\n\n\"L. sylvaticus\" primarily breeds in ephemeral pools rather than permanent water bodies such as ponds or lakes. This is believed to provide some protection of the adult frogs and their offspring (eggs and tadpoles) from predation by fish and other predators of permanent water bodies. Adult wood frogs emerge from hibernation in early spring and migrate to nearby pools. There, males chorus, emitting duck-like quacking sounds.\n\nA male approaches a female and clasps her behind her forearms before hooking his thumbs together around her in a hold called \"amplexus\" which is continued until the female deposits the eggs. Females deposit eggs attached to submerged substrate, typically vegetation or downed branches. Most commonly, females deposit eggs adjacent to other egg masses, creating large aggregations of masses.\n\nSome advantage is conferred to pairs first to breed, as clutches closer to the center of the raft absorb heat and develop faster than those on the periphery, and have more protection from predators. If pools dry before tadpoles metamorphose into froglets, they die. This constitutes the risk counterbalancing the antipredator protection of ephemeral pools. By breeding in early spring, however, wood frogs increase their offspring's chances of metamorphosing before pools dry.\n\nThe larvae undergo two stages of development: fertilization to free-living tadpoles, and free-living tadpoles to juvenile frogs. During the first stage, the larvae are adapted for rapid development, and their growth depends on the temperature of the water and has a higher mortality rate. The second stage of development features rapid development and growth, and depends on environmental factors including food availability, temperature, and population density.\n\nFollowing metamorphosis, a small percentage (less than 20%) of juveniles will disperse, permanently leaving the vicinity of their natal pools. The majority of offspring are philopatric, returning to their natal pool to breed. Most frogs breed only once in their lives, although some will breed two or three times, generally with differences according to age. The success of the larvae and tadpoles is important in populations of wood frogs because they affect the gene flow and genetic variation of the following generations.\n\nAlthough the wood frog is not endangered or threatened, in many parts of its range urbanization is fragmenting populations. Several studies have shown, under certain thresholds of forest cover loss or over certain thresholds of road density, wood frogs and other common amphibians begin to \"drop out\" of formerly occupied habitats. Another conservation concern is that wood frogs are primarily dependent on smaller, \"geographically isolated\" wetlands for breeding. At least in the United States, these wetlands are largely unprotected by federal law, leaving it up to states to tackle the problem of conserving pool-breeding amphibians.\n\nThe wood frog has a complex lifecycle that depends on multiple habitats, damp lowlands, and adjacent woodlands. Their habitat conservation is, therefore, complex, requiring integrated, landscape-scale preservation.\n\nWood frog development in the tadpole stage is known to be negatively effected by road salt contaminating freshwater ecosystems.\n\n\n"}

Under its previous name, Red Circle Comics, it published non-humor characters, particularly superheroes in the 1970s and 1980s, and was a digital imprint from 2012 to 2014. In 2015, it was converted back to a print imprint and was completely revamped as Dark Circle Comics, featuring darker and more mature content than previous incarnations of Archie's superhero line.\n\nThe term \"Red Circle characters\" is also used to refer to Archie Comics' superheroes, including such characters as the Black Hood, The Shield, the Wizard, the Hangman, The Fly, Flygirl, The Comet, The Web, Jaguar, and the Fox.\n\nThese characters were previously published when Archie Comics was MLJ Magazines, then published under various Archie imprints: Archie Adventure Series, Radio Comics/Mighty Comics Group, Red Circle Comics and the Red Circle Comics digital imprint (2012).\n\nArchie licensed their Red Circle characters to DC Comics in the early 1990s under the DC imprint Impact Comics, and then again from 2007 to 2011, when DC attempted to integrate them into the DC Universe. When this failed, the characters reverted to Archie Comics, which launched the imprint digitally. The company retired this in late 2014; the line was relaunched as the Dark Circle Comics imprint in 2015.\n\nMLJ's first comic book published in November 1939 was \"Blue Ribbon Comics\", with the first half of the magazine in full color and the second half in red and white tints.\n\nIn January 1940, \"Pep Comics\" debuted with the Shield, created by writer and managing editor Harry Shorten and artist Irv Novick. The Shield was one of the first superheroes with a costume based upon United States patriotic iconography, first appearing 14 months earlier than Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's Captain America.\n\nMLJ's Golden Age heroes also included the Black Hood, who also appeared in pulp magazines and a radio show; and The Wizard, who shared a title with the Shield. \"Top-Notch Comics\" (featuring, among others, The Wizard, Black Hood, and \nThe Firefly) was launched in December 1941.\n\nThe Archie character soon dominated MLJ publications, pushing out the superheroes. For instance, at first, the cover feature of \"Pep Comics \" was The Shield; he and The Hangman shared the cover with Archie in \"Pep Comics\" #36 (February, 1943). Archie increasingly was given the cover until issue #51 (August, 1944), when he took over the cover permanently. The company was later (in 1946) renamed after the character.\n\n\nArchie's Silver Age relaunch of its superheroes under the Archie Adventure Series line featured two new characters, The Jaguar and The Fly, as well as a new version of the Shield, inspired by DC's revivals of their 1940s characters. The Archie Adventure Series line debuted with the June 1959 release of \"The Double Life of Private Strong\" #1, by creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, which also introduced The Fly, also by Simon and Kirby. DC Comics' lawyers, citing similarity to Superman, forced Archie Comics to stop publishing \"Private Strong\" after two issues. \"Adventures of The Fly\" appeared two months after \"Private Strong\" #1 and ran for 30 issues under that title, until October, 1964. \"The Adventures of the Jaguar\" began in September 1961 and ran for 15 issues until November 1963. During this time, Archie Comics licensed the 1930s pulp character The Shadow, whom they portrayed first as a spy in a James Bond mode, before turning him into a costumed superhero. Archie's version of \"The Shadow\" ran for eight issues (Aug. 1964 – Sept. 1965). In addition, the Jaguar, The Fly, and his partner Flygirl appeared in issues of \"Pep Comics\" and \"Laugh Comics\" between 1961 and 1963. Much of the output during the Adventure Series period after the departure of Simon and Kirby was by writer Robert Bernstein and artists John Rosenberger and John Giunta.\n\nThe Mighty Comics Group imprint (alternately known as Radio Comics) took over the Adventure titles in the mid-1960s as general imitation of Marvel Comics and the \"Batman\" TV show camp; Superman creator Jerry Siegel was brought in to be the imprint's main writer, along with Marvel Comics artist Paul Reinman. The shift to the Mighty imprint (which first appeared on covers dated January 1966) included changing the title \"Adventures of The Fly\" into \"Fly Man\". \n\nThe first issue of \"Fly Man\", #31, brought the company its first super hero team (similar to Marvel's Avengers), The Mighty Crusaders, made up of Fly Man, a newly revived version of The Shield, The Black Hood (who had appeared occasionally in \"Adventures of The Fly\"), and a newly revived version of The Comet (who had appeared a few months before in the final issue of \"Adventures of The Fly\"). The Mighty Crusaders spun off into their own title after three \"Fly Man\" appearances. The Wizard and the Hangman, who had been heroes during their MLJ publication, became recurring villains. In \"The Mighty Crusaders\" #4, many of the old MLJ heroes made cameo appearances. In November 1966, with issue 40, \"Fly Man\" changed its name again to \"Mighty Comics\", which featured various Mighty super-heroes (The Shield, The Web, The Hangman, Steel Sterling, Mister Justice) in rotating solo adventures until its cancellation ten issues later. Similarly, the final issue of \"Mighty Crusaders\" was taken over by a solo adventure of Steel Sterling. The Mighty Comics Group line was cancelled in late 1967. Several stories from this period were published in the mass-market paperback \"High Camp Super-Heroes\" by Belmont Books in 1966 (Belmont was owned by the same company that owned Archie), which featured an introduction by Siegel, as well as in a 1966 deluxe special, \"Super Heroes Versus Super Villains\".\n\nRed Circle Comics was launched in the late 1970s as a fantasy/horror imprint, but switched over to superheroes in the 1980s.\n\nThe line was first used to publish \"Chilling Adventures in Sorcery\" in October 1973, which for its first two issues was called \"Chilling Adventures in Sorcery as Told by Sabrina\". With the third issue, the title was renamed and published under Red Circle Comics. The name \"Red Circle\" was based on the previous business that Michael Silberkleit's father had with Martin Goodman, with Gray Morrow as editor. With issue number 6 \"Chilling Adventures\" was renamed \"Red Circle Sorcery\" and lasted until issue number 11 (Feb. 1975). Red Circle published one issue of \"The Super Cops\" (based on the movie of the same name) in July 1974. Shortly thereafter, \"Mad House\" (a re-title of \"Mad House Glads\") was published under the Red Circle Comics line starting with issue number 95 (Sept. 1974). This ended after number 97 (January 1975), when the title reverted to being a standard Archie humor title.\n\nIn 1978 and 1979, Archie published two digests collecting their superhero materials from the 1960s. The first was titled \"Archie's Super Hero Special\". The second issue was titled \"Archie's Super Hero Comic Digest Magazine\", and is notable for publishing the previously unpublished revamp of the Black Hood done by Gray Morrow and Neal Adams. There was nothing on their covers to indicate they were Red Circle titles; only the interior indicia indicated the publisher.\n\nIn the 1980s, Archie made a concerted effort to reuse its superheroes. The first appearance was in JC Comics's \"JCP Features\" #1 (Dec. 1981), which reprinted the new Black Hood materials that appeared in \"Archie Super Hero Comic Digest Magazine\" #2. In March 1983, the Red Circle brand was resurrected with first issue of a new volume of \"Mighty Crusaders\". That title lasted 13 issues and led to many new titles under the Red Circle Comics banner, including \"The Fly\" (nine issues, May 1983-October, 1984), \"Black Hood\" (three issues, June–October, 1983), \"Lancelot Strong, The Shield\" (two issues, June–August, 1983, before becoming \"Shield – Steel Sterling\" for issue #3 [Dec. 1983] and finally \"Steel Sterling\" for issues #4–7 [Jan.-July, 1984]), \"The Original Shield\" (four issues, April–Oct., 1984), \"Blue Ribbon\" (14 issues, including new material and reprints of older material; Nov. 1983-Dec. 1984), and \"The Comet\" (two issues of a three-issue miniseries, October–December, 1983). Though this 1980s incarnation featured Rich Buckler's work prominently, it also featured contributions from others, including artists Jim Steranko, Alex Toth, Steve Ditko, Rudy Nebres, Alan Weiss, Carmine Infantino, Dick Ayers, John Severin, and Pat Boyette.\n\nWith the February 1984 issues, the Red Circle line was renamed the Archie Adventure Series, reviving the name from the company's superhero line of the early 1960s. During this period, the company published, as either Red Circle or Archie Adventure, a comic-book tie-in to Remco's \"ManTech Robot Warriors\" toy line (two issues, Sept.-Dec. 1984), a Katy Keene Special (Sept. 1983), and an issue of \"Thunder Bunny\" (Jan. 1984). By September 1985, the entire line that originated with Red Circle had been cancelled.\n\nIn 1988, however, with Archie's acquisition of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" license, the Archie Adventure Series returned as the imprint behind \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures\", which ran 72 issues until October 1995. In the late 1980s, Archie Adventure Series published \"The Adventures of Bayou Billy\", based on a popular video game, and in the early 1990s the imprint published \"Mighty Mutanimals\", a superhero team comic spun off from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nArchie planned to begin publishing superheroes again in the late 1980s with an imprint called Spectrum Comics, featuring a number of high-profile talents, including Steve Englehart, Jim Valentino, Marv Wolfman, Michael Bair, Kelley Jones, and Rob Liefeld. Planned Spectrum titles included \"The Fly\", \"The Fox\", \"Hangman\", \"Jaguar\", \"Mister Justice\", and \"The Shield\". Ultimately, Archie cancelled Spectrum Comics before publishing a single issue.\n\nDC Comics licensed the Red Circle characters and revamped them for publishing under the Impact Comics imprint from 1991 to 1992. This attempt also included a super team, called simply \"The Crusaders\". The stories in the line were set their own shared universe, unrelated to previous incarnations of the characters or to DC's own fictional universe.\n\nDC was granted the license to the Red Circle characters in 2008. DC planned to inject the characters into the DC Universe and tapped writer J. Michael Straczynski. The line folded in late 2010. In July 2011, it was revealed that DC no longer had the rights to them.\n\nArchie Comics announced at the New York Comic Con in October 2011 that its superhero line will return as an all-digital line under a subscription model with back issues archive access. This was announced as the Red Circle line starting with the New Crusader comic in 2012. The Red Circle Comics app provides readers access to a new chapter of the \"New Crusaders\" comic, as well as the Red Circle library of comics from the previous 70 years for a 99 cent weekly subscription price.\n\nIn 2012, New Crusaders was followed up with \"Lost Crusade: Prelude\", a free one-shot focusing on the lives of the original Mighty Crusaders which debuted on August 29 through the Red Circle Comics app at RedCircleComics.com. Ian Flynn had pitched the idea as \"I was really excited by all the prospective stories to be told between the end of the '80s series and our relaunch... There were so many open endings when the '80s era series wrapped up that it's hard to choose. What happened to Darkling? Who was the traitor? Did Black Hood figure it out, or just make things worse? Did anyone mourn Doc Reeves?\" The first arc of New Crusaders was also printed.\n\nChuck Dixon was announced as writing the second story arc of \"Lost Crusade\" and \"New Crusaders: Dark Tomorrow\" was announced for May 2013, but neither was released.\n\nA five-issue \"The Fox\" miniseries by Mark Waid and Dean Haspiel began in October 2013, with \"The Shield\" back-up strips by J.M. DeMatteis (who co-wrote \"Fox\" #5 instead of Waid).\n\nIn July 2014, Archie Comics announced that the Red Circle Comics imprint would be relaunched as Dark Circle Comics in early 2015 with the past continuity removed. Tales will be self-contained, five-issue story arcs in ongoing series \"Black Hood\" debuted in February 2015, followed by \"The Fox\", continuing from the digital Red Circle line in April 2015, with \"The Shield\" debuting in September 2015 after being delayed. A digital exclusive, \"Sam Hill: In The Crosshairs\", was released in October 2015 featuring former NYPD detective Sam Hill. A fourth series, \"The Hangman\", is set to debut in November 2015. In July 2015, the publisher announced a revamped version of its 1940s character the Web would debut the following year.\n\nAs of 2016\n\nFormer\n\nTitles in publication as of 2016\n\n\n"}

This was the first election held in Manitoba after the breakup of a ten-year coalition government led by the Liberal-Progressives and Progressive Conservatives. The coalition, which began in 1940, was ended in 1950 when the Progressive Conservatives crossed to the opposition side.\n\nThis was also the last provincial election in Manitoba to feature multi-member constituencies and election by the single transferable ballot. Winnipeg Centre, Winnipeg North and Winnipeg South elected four members each, while St. Boniface elected two members. All other constituencies elected one member by instant runoff voting.\n\nThe result of the election was a convincing victory for the Liberal-Progressive government of Premier Douglas Campbell, which won thirty-two of fifty-seven seats. Three Independent Liberal-Progressives were also elected. The Progressive Conservatives, led by Errick Willis, saw their representation in the legislature increase from nine to twelve members. This was a disappointing result for many in the party. Willis had been a prominent cabinet minister in the coalition government, and many questioned the sincerity of his new-found opposition to Campbell's ministry. The following year, he lost the leadership of the party to Dufferin Roblin.\n\nThe social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) suffered a disappointing loss under new leader Lloyd Stinson, falling from seven seats to five.\n\nDuring the campaign, the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" newspaper devoted considerable attention to the return of the Social Credit Party in Manitoba. The party had not contested the previous provincial election, but was buoyed by the recent Social Credit victory in British Columbia and ran several candidates. The \"Free Press\", which supported the Liberal-Progressives, and played up the threat of a Social Credit victory to rally popular support for the government. The actual threat posed by Social Credit was minimal: only two of its candidates were elected.\n\nThe Communist Labor-Progressive Party also won representation in the legislature, with party incumbent Bill Kardash taking one of the four constituency seats in Winnipeg North. This was the last time that a Communist candidate won election to the Manitoba legislature, or indeed to any provincial legislature in Canada.\n\nTwo independent candidates were also elected, in addition to the three Independent Liberal-Progressives.\n\n\n(x) denotes incumbent.\n\nArthur:\n\nAssiniboia:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nFournier and Bloomfield were eliminated, and their votes were distributed as follows: Wightman 837, Mackling 768. 600 votes were non-transferable.\n\n\"Final Count\"\n\nBirtle:\n\nBrandon City:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nWyborn was eliminated, and his votes were distributed as follows: Lissaman 272, Creighton 138. 646 votes were non-transferable.\n\n\"Second Count\"\n\nCarillon:\n\nCypress:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nFerg was subsequently declared elected on transfers from Philippe.\n\nDauphin:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nBullmore was subsequently elected on transfers.\n\nDeloraine-Glenwood:\n\nDufferin:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nMcDonald was subsequently elected on transfers from Collins.\n\nEmerson:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nSolomon was subsequently declared elected on transfers from Friesen.\n\nEthelbert:\n\nFairford:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nJoseph H.

Herman Scheel was nominated in his place, but also withdrew after discovering that some electors who had signed his nomination papers believed they were endorsing Bailey.\n\nThe surpluses of Swailes and Juba were not transferred, as they were too small to affect the final candidate order. Scott was declared elected to the fourth position, despite finishing below the quota.\n\nKardash and Turk were declared elected to the third and fourth positions, even though both finished below the quota.\n\nStinson's surplus of 146 was not transferred, as it would not have affected the candidate order.\n\nThe election in Rupertsland was deferred to July 6, due to the difficulties of enumeration in this vast northern constituency. The election in Ste. Rose was also deferred to July 6, after incumbent Liberal-Progressive candidate Maurice Dane MacCarthy died on the eve of the general election.\n\nThe election did not technically end until July 21, 1953, when the final results for Rupertsland were announced.\n\nRupertsland (deferred to July 6, 1958):\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives initially nominated E.G. Perry, but he withdrew from the contest and endorsed Brown. Brown was declared elected following transfers from Abbott. The official Elections Manitoba report of this constituency lists Boulette as an official Liberal-Progressive candidate, but newspaper reports from the period indicate that he was an Independent Liberal-Progressive.\n\nSte. Rose:\n\n\"First Count\"\n\nPineau was eliminated, and his votes were transferred as follows: Molgat 192, Fletcher 83. 616 votes were not transferred.\n\n\"Second Count\"\n\nResults for the first ballot counts for all constituencies are taken from the 1954 Canadian Parliamentary Guide, and from Election Manitoba's \"Historical Summaries\" (printed as an appendix to the 2003 election results).\n\nThere are minor discrepancies between these sources for the Social Credit vote count in Brandon City, Manitou-Morden, Rockwood and Swan River. The sources also disagree as to the candidate order for Minnedosa on the first count (although both agree that Gilbert Hutton was subsequently elected). In each case, the \"Historical Summaries\" entry has been taken as more reliable.\n\nAll results after the first ballot are taken from reports in the \"Winnipeg Free Press\". This paper made an obvious error in reporting Lloyd Stinson's fifth-vote count, which has been corrected here. Other than this, the results for multi-member constituencies may be taken as accurate and verifiable. For the single-member constituencies, it possible that \"Free Press\" reports differed from the final results in some particulars.\n\nIvan Schultz (Mountain, LP) resigned his seat in the first half of 1955, while James O. Argue (Deloraine-Glenwood, PC) died in the same period. By-elections for both constituencies were held on June 27, 1955. The CCF concluded that it did not have a chance of victory in either seat, and declined to nominate candidates. Social Credit also planned to stay out of the elections, until Roger Poiron entered the Mountain poll without consulting the provincial party. Although not technically an official candidate, he still received support from the Social Credit organization.\n\nThe \"Winnipeg Free Press\"'s coverage indicates that the Campbell government was concerned with the results of the 1955 by-elections. Mountain had previously been regarded as one of the safest Liberal-Progressive seats in the province, and Boulic's performance was unexpectedly strong. Many leading government figures had campaigned for Clark in the campaign's final days, to ensure his victory. Clark received most of his support from Mountain's Anglo-Saxon majority and large Flemish community, while Boulic did well among French Canadians, who made up about one third of the voters.\n\nSt. George (dec.

{"id": "1950640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950640", "title": "Propaganda in China", "text": "Propaganda in China\n\nPropaganda in China refers to the use of propaganda by the Communist Party of China (CPC) sway domestic and international opinion in favor of its policies. Domestically, this includes censorship of proscribed views and an active promotion of views that favor the government. Propaganda is considered central to the operation of the CPC government. The common Chinese term \"xuanchuan\" (宣传) can mean \"dissemination\", \"propaganda\", or \"publicity\".\n\nAspects of propaganda can be traced back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries owing to mass media and an authoritarian government. China during the Mao era is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimize the state and the policies of leaders. It was the first time the CPC successfully made use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and illiterate population.\n\nToday, propaganda in China is usually depicted through cultivation of the economy and Chinese nationalism.\n\nThe origins of the CCP propaganda system can be traced to Yan'an Rectification Movement and the rectification movements carried out there. Following which it became a key mechanism in the Party's campaigns. Mao explicitly laid out the political role of culture in his 1942 \"Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Art and Literature\". The propaganda system, considered a central part of CCP's \"control system\", drew much from Soviet, Nazi and other totalitarian states' propaganda methods. It represented a quintessential Leninist \"transmission belt\" for indoctrination and mass mobilization.\nDavid Shambaugh observes that propaganda and indoctrination are considered to have been a hallmark of the Maoist China; the CCP employed a variety of \"thought control\" techniques, including incarceration for \"thought reform,\" construction of role models to be emulated, mass mobilization campaigns, the creation of ideological monitors and propaganda teams for indoctrination purposes, enactment of articles to be memorized, control of the educational system and media, a nationwide system of loudspeakers, among other methods. While ostensibly aspiring to a \"Communist utopia,\" often had a negative focus on constantly searching for enemies among the people. The means of persuasion was often extremely violent, \"a literal acting out of class struggle.\"\n\nAccording to Anne-Marie Brady, an Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury's School of Political Science and Communication, CCP propaganda and thought work (\"sīxiǎng gōngzuò\" 思想工作) traditionally had a much broader notion of the public sphere than is usually defined by media specialists. Chinese propagandists used every possible means of communication available in China after 1949, including electronic media such as film and television, educational curriculum and research, print media such as newspapers and posters, cultural arts such as plays and music, oral media such as memorizing Mao quotes, as well as thought reform and political study classes.\n\nChina Central Television has traditionally served as a major national conduit for televised propaganda, while the \"People's Daily\" newspaper has served as a medium for print propaganda. During the Mao era, a distinctive feature of propaganda and thought work was \"rule by editorial,\" according to Brady. Political campaigns would be launched through editorials and leading articles in \"People's Daily\", which would be followed by other papers. Work units and other organizational political study groups utilized these articles as a source for political study, and reading newspapers in China was \"a political obligation\". Mao used Lenin's model for the media, which had it function as a tool of mass propaganda, agitation, and organization.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, PRC propaganda was crucial to intensification of the Mao cult, as well as mobilizing popular participation in national campaigns. Past propaganda also encouraged the Chinese people to emulate government approved model workers and soldiers, such as Lei Feng, Chinese Civil War hero Dong Cunrui, Korean War hero Yang Gensi, and Dr. Norman Bethune, a Canadian doctor who assisted the Communist Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It also praised Third World revolutionaries and close foreign allies such as Albania and North Korea while vilifying both the American \"imperialists\" and the Soviet \"revisionists\" (the latter of whom was seen as having betrayed Marxism–Leninism following the Sino-Soviet split).\n\nAccording to Barbara Mittler, Mao propaganda left memories of violence and slander upon many Chinese, and their psychological strains drove many to madness and death. Today, Mao propaganda is no longer used by the CCP, and are largely commercialized for the purposes of nostalgia.\n\nFollowing the death of Chairman Mao in 1976, propaganda was used to blacken the character of the Gang of Four, which was blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. During the era of economic reform and modernization that was initiated by Deng Xiaoping, propaganda promoting \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" was distributed. The first post-Mao campaign was in 1983 which saw the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign.\n\nThe events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were an indication to many elders in the CCP that liberalization in the propaganda sector had gone too far, and that the Party must re-establish its control over ideology and the propaganda system.\n\nBrady writes that propaganda and thought work have become the \"life blood\" of the Party-State since the post-1989 period, and one of the key means for guaranteeing the CCP's continued legitimacy and hold on power.\n\nIn the 1990s, propaganda theorists described the challenges to China's propaganda and thought work as \"blind spots\"; mass communication was advocated as the antidote. From the early 1990s, selective concepts from mass communications theory, public relations, advertising, social psychology, and other areas of modern mass persuasion were introduced into China's propaganda system for the purpose of creating a modern propaganda model.\n\nKurlantzick and Link noted that through cultivating economic growth and Chinese nationalism, the CCP has modernized authoritarianism to maintain their political control. They asserted that elite business leaders, who have benefited from China's economic growth, have accepted the CCP's authoritarian control as a result, largely preventing the new rich and emerging middle class from challenging their rule. Fenby argues that the latter, rather than accepting the system \"per se\", have learnt to use it to their advantage. Kurlantzick and Link also noted that dissent still largely exists in the Chinese populace in regards to government policies on the economy, environment and society, particularly in rural areas, as they are becoming more aware of their constitutional rights. A recent poll in 2007 showed that 70% of Chinese consider the new rich to be corrupt and unworthy of respect.\n\nIn early 2009, the Communist Party embarked on a multibillion-dollar global media expansion, including a 24-hour English-language news channel in the style of Western news agencies. According to Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, it was part of Hu Jintao's plan to \"go global\" and make \"the voice of China better heard in international affairs\", by strengthening their foreign-language services, and being less political in their broadcasting. Bequelin notes that their function is to channel a specific view of China to an international audience, and their fundamental premise remains the same; that all information broadcast must reflect the government's views. The Chinese government encouraged the adaption of Western style media marketing in their news agencies due to internal competition with national commercial media.\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics were portrayed by the Chinese government as a symbol of China's pride and place in the world, and seem to have bolstered some domestic support for the Chinese government, and support for the policies of the Communist Party of China, giving rise to concerns that the state will possibly have more leverage to disperse dissent.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political issues not directly related to the games were to be downplayed; topics such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as \"cancer-causing mineral water.\" As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, there was widespread speculation that China's desire for a perfect Games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula.\n\nIn 2011, then Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai and the city's Propaganda Department initiated a 'Red Songs campaign' that demanded every district, government departments and commercial corporations, universities and schools, state radio and TV stations to begin singing \"red songs\", praising the achievements of the Communist Party of China and PRC. Bo said the aim was \"to reinvigorate the city with the Marxist ideals of his father's comrade-in-arms Mao Zedong\"; although academic Ding Xueliang of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology suspected the campaign's aim was to further his political standing within the country's leadership.\n\nAccording to the \"SOED\", English \"propaganda\" originally meant \"a committee of cardinals responsible for foreign missions\" (from Latin \"Congregatio de Propaganda Fide\" \"Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith\") in the 18th century, but in the 20th century, the meaning negatively changed to \"the systematic dissemination of doctrine, rumour, or selected information to propagate or promote a particular doctrine, view, practice, etc.; ideas, information, etc. disseminated thus (frequently \"derogatory\")\". While the English word usually has a pejorative connotation, the Chinese word \"xuānchuán\" (宣传 \"propaganda; publicity\") can have either a neutral connotation in official PRC contexts or a pejorative one in informal contexts.\n\n\"Xuānchuán\" first appeared in the 3rd-century historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms meaning \"to announce or convey information\", and was chosen to translate the Marxist-Leninist concept of Russian \"propagánda\" in the early 20th-century China. Some \"xuanchuan\" collocations usually refer to \"propaganda\" (e.g., \"xuānchuánzhàn\" 宣传战 \"propaganda war\"), others to \"publicity\" (\"xuānchuán méijiè\" 宣传媒介 \"mass media; means of publicity\"), and still others are ambiguous (\"xuānchuányuán\" 宣传员 \"propagandist; publicist\").\n\nMedia operations and content are tightly controlled, and the Party largely determines what appears in news reports. Controlling media content allows the Communist Party to disseminate propaganda supportive of government policies, censor controversial news stories, and have reports published criticizing political adversaries, including advocates of religious freedom and democracy, supporters of Taiwanese and Tibetan independence, and representatives of the United States government. In 2005, Reporters Without Borders published a report about the state-run news agency Xinhua, calling it \"the world's biggest propaganda agency\".\n\nWhile in the past the CCP's Central Propaganda Department and its local branches sent faxes to all media throughout the country with instructions indicating subjects that the media should stress or avoid entirely, directives are now imparted to ranking media managers or editors during phone conversations—a move designed to reduce the paper trail. Media in China faces few restrictions on content that is not deemed to be politically damaging.\n\nWu Xuecan, a former editor of the \"People's Daily\" overseas edition, reports that through control of the \"ideological domain, material means and living necessities,\" editors and reporters are conditioned to keep news and reports aligned with the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. Wu further reports that, political study sessions ensures that editors first practice self-censorship. He Qinglian writes that long years of media control have bred in Chinese journalists a habit of \"self-discipline,\" and that most Chinese journalists resign themselves to playing the role of \"Party mouthpieces.\" Control is also directed at sources of information, as ordinary people are restricted from providing news to Chinese media, and more so to foreign media. In 2020, propaganda from China has been controlled by Chinese authorities through the propaganda news station Global Times, portraying the handling of COVID-19 as a success, even though this is false information.\n\nPropaganda and thought work in the Maoist era had a number of distinctive features, according to Brady, such as \"ideological remolding\" or \"thought reform\" (思想改造), ideological purges, ritual humiliation of ideological opponents, an emphasis on political study to raise levels of awareness of the current line, and targeting high-profile individuals as symbols of negative tendencies which must be eradicated.\n\nThe experiences of propaganda and thought work in the Cultural Revolution provided the CCP with a \"profound lesson,\" according to Brady. Virtually all post-Mao era Party leaders had been under attack during that time, and drew two seemingly contradictory lessons: the rejection of mass movements and thought reform as means of transforming China, and the recognition of the \"vital role of propaganda and thought work in China's political control.\" The administration of propaganda and thought work was plagued by these issues through the 1980s, and up to the events of 4 June 1989.\n\nBiderman and Meyers wrote in 1968 that while some kind of thought reform is characteristic of all totalitarian regimes, the CCP \"set about it more purposefully, more massively, and more intensively than have other ruling groups,\" including through employing known techniques in new ways. They note the presence of such techniques in Maoist political campaigns, such as daily meetings for criticism and self-criticism; surveillance and sanctions were connected with education to find and correct deficiencies in personal conducts. In the military, political leaders attacked all personal connections between soldiers that were not based on political conviction, thus exploiting social pressures and personal anxieties to build a sense of conformity.\n\nIn terms of intensity and scope, spiritual control has been reinforced under the CCP's rule, and has become a basic feature of citizens' daily life, according to Victor Shaw. To an extent, the \"freedom of silence\" cherished by some older Chinese scholars was not even possible for an illiterate peasant in a remote area under the CCP mass propaganda.\n\nAccording to Shaw, the CCP utilizes propaganda to spread its policies, build social consensus, and mobilize the population for social programs. Ideological tensions result in mass movements, and the resulting spiritual control legitimizes the political establishment. \"Political studies, legal education, heroic models, and thought reform provide the CCP with effective weapons to propagandize rules and legal codes, normalize individual behaviour, and rehabilitate deviants in labor camps.\"\n\nKurlantzick and Link stated that the CCP uses the technique of \"thoughtwork\" (sixiang gongzuo) to maintain popular obedience, dating back to the Mao Zedong era. They noted that while Mao-era campaigns are aimed at transforming the Chinese society and people's natures, the modern approach to thoughtwork are more subtle and only focuses on issues important to the CCP's rule. According to Kurlantzick and Link, it consists largely of cultivating pro-government views in the media and other influential people in Chinese society, and as such complaints against the government becomes distracted with pro-government propaganda. The government also attempts to distance itself from local issues by blaming them on corrupt local officials, says Kurlantzick and Link.\n\nAccording to Anne-Marie Brady, the Foreign Ministry first set up a system of designated officials to give information in times of crisis in 1983, and greatly expanded the system to lower levels in the mid-1990s. China's spin had been directed only at foreigners, but in the 1990s leaders realised that managing public crises was useful for domestic politics; this included setting up provincial level \"News Coordinator Groups,\" and inviting foreign PR firms to give seminars.\n\nBrady writes that Chinese foreign propaganda officials took cues from the Blair government's spin doctoring during the mad cow disease crisis of 2000–2001, and the Bush government's use of the U.S. media after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. According to her, the Blair model allows for a certain amount of negative coverage to be shown during a crisis, which is believed to help release some of the \"social tension\" surrounding it. She believes information managers in China used this approach during coal mining disasters of 2005.\n\nAccording to Brady, trained official spokespeople are now available on call in every central government ministry, as well as in local governments, to deal with emerging crises; these spin doctors are coordinated and trained by the Office of Foreign Propaganda/State Council Information Office.\n\nDuring the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, Communist Party officials moved swiftly in a public relations campaign. According to Newsweek, Party officials felt that the recent riots risked tarnishing China's global image, and underwent a public relations program involving quickly getting out the government's official version of the events, as well as transporting foreign journalists to riot affected areas. The growth in new technologies, such as email and SMS, forced the CCP's hand into taking up spin.\n\nInstead of attempting a media blackout as with the 2008 Tibetan unrest, the Party has adopted a series of more advanced techniques to influence the information leaving China. The day after violence in Ürümqi, the State Council Information Office set up a Xinjiang Information Office in Ürümqi to assist foreign reporters. It invited foreign media to Xinjiang to tour the riot zones, visit hospitals, and look at the aftermath themselves. Journalists were also given CDs with photos and TV clips. \"They try to control the foreign journalists as much as possible by using this more sophisticated PR work rather than ban[ning] them,\" according to Professor Xiao Qiang, quoted by Newsweek.\n\nAccording to David Shambaugh, professor of political science and international affairs at the Elliott School of International Affairs and a fellow of the Brookings Institution, the CCP's propaganda system extends itself as a sprawling bureaucratic establishment, into virtually every medium concerned with the dissemination of information. Shambaugh notes that according to the CCP publication \"Zhongguo Gongchandang jianshe dazidian.\" numerous public places, such as media and news organizations, educational institutions, literature and art centers, and cultural exhibitions come under CCP's propaganda oversight. Shambaugh believes that this expansive definition implies that every conceivable medium which transmits and conveys information to the people of China falls under bureaucratic purview of the CCP Propaganda Department (CCPPD). Shambaugh states that the writ of the CCPPD has remained unchanged since the Maoist era, although the mechanics of oversight and active censorship have undergone considerable evolution.\n\nAccording to official government reports in 2003, channels of propaganda dissemination of the CCPPD included 2,262 television stations (of which 2,248 were \"local\"), 2,119 newspapers, 9,074 periodicals and 1,123 publishing houses, in addition to internal circulation papers and local gazetteers, approximately 68 million internet accounts with more than 100 million users, and more than 300 million mobile phone users who fall under the system's purview.\n\nAccording to Brady, propaganda work by the CCP has been historically divided into two categories: directed towards Chinese people (internal or \"duinei\") and directed towards foreigners and the outside world (external or \"duiwai\") as well as four types: political, economic, cultural and social. The Central Propaganda Department oversees internal propaganda, and, the closely linked bureaucracy, The Office of Foreign Propaganda matters relating to external propaganda.\n\nShambaugh states that the propaganda system, including the Central Propaganda Department, are highly secret and does not appear in officially published diagrams of the Chinese Bureaucratic System, whether in Chinese or in other languages. The Office of Foreign Propaganda itself is more commonly known as 'Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China', under the dual nameplate system, according to Brady. The chief of Chinese propaganda, Li Changchun, was named as nineteenth most powerful person in the world by Forbes magazine in 2009.\n\nTraditionally, the CCP propaganda apparatus had been based around suppressing news and information, but this often meant the Party found itself in a reactive posture, according to Chinese media expert David Bandurski. In later years the Internet played a key role in the spread of propaganda to Chinese diaspora. PRC-based Internet sites remain a leading source of Chinese-language and China-related news for overseas Chinese. The Internet is an extremely effective tool for guiding and organizing overseas Chinese public opinion, according to Anne-Marie Brady.\n\nBrady cites an example of the role of the Internet in organizing popular protests by overseas Chinese, its usage by the state against a perceived bias of the Western media in its coverage of unrest in Tibetan areas in March 2008 and, a month later, in organizing a series of worldwide demonstrations in support of China during the Olympic torch relay.\n\nBrady noted that these protests were genuine and popular, demonstrating the effectiveness of China's efforts to rebuild positive public opinion within the Chinese overseas diaspora, but the demonstrations nevertheless received official support both symbolically and in practice While there was no compulsion for overseas Chinese to attend the rallies, those who did were given free T-shirts, souvenirs, transport, and accommodation, donated by local embassy officials and China-based donors.\n\nOn April 29, 2020, an animated video was posted on Twitter and YouTube, called \"Once Upon a Virus\", used Lego figures to represent China through hospital workers and Lady Liberty representing America, was posted by \"New China TV\". \"The Lego Group\", for their part, said they had nothing to do with the video in question. In the video, the hospital worker repeatedly warns the US about the outbreak, but they dismiss them, talking about lockdowns being a violation of human rights, or paywalls. By that point, Lady Liberty is hooked up to an IV and looks severely ill, and at the end, the US says \"We are always correct, even when we contradict ourselves\", and China responds with \"That’s what I love best about you Americans, your consistency\". Like any piece of propaganda, it ignores the facts; the Chinese delaying warning the public about the outbreak, but doctors tried to warn people via social media. The Associated Press reports \n\"China’s rigid controls on information, bureaucratic hurdles and a reluctance to send bad news up the chain of command muffled early warnings\".\n\nThe Chinese government regularly uses fake social media accounts and posts to attempt to shape online dialogue and steer discussions away from sensitive topics. This is done by specially trained internet users who comment on blogs, public forums, or wikis, to shift the debate in favor of the Communist Party and influence public opinion. They are sometime called the \"50-cent party\" – named so because they are allegedly paid 50 Chinese cents for each comment supporting the CCP they make, though some speculate that they are probably not paid anything for the posts, instead being required to do so as a part of their official Party duties.\n\nAn internal government document released by the BBC outlines the requirements for those employed as online posters, which include having \"relatively good political and professional qualities, and have a pioneering and enterprising spirit\", being able to react quickly, etc.\n\nIt is believed that such government-sponsored Internet commentators have now become widespread and their numbers could be in the tens of thousands; Bandurski suggests the number may be up to 280,000 while The Guardian puts the estimate as 300,000. According to \"The Guardian\", the growth in popularity of such astroturfing owes to the ease with which web 2.0 technologies such as Twitter, Wikipedia and YouTube can be employed to sway public opinion. The BBC reports that special centres have been set up to train China's 'army of internet spin doctors'. Data analysis of social media activity and leaked government emails by a team led by Gary King at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Science showed that the Chinese government generates over 440 million posts every year through such accounts.\n\nWithin the doctrine of China's peaceful rise resorting to Peace Journalism has been analyzed as a growing trend in China's strategy for domestic propaganda, in particular in covering news from Xinjiang. After Zbigniew Brzezinski's having termed Central Asia the \"Global Balkans\" Idriss Aberkane has argued the resorting to unilateral, state-endorsed Peace Journalism could be a way for China to \"de-balkanize\" Xinjiang. This he has called \"coercive Peace Journalism\".\n\nThe Chinese government has used its public evaluations of historical, public figures as a means of communicating to the Chinese public the traits and political goals that it considers desirable and undesirable. The Chinese government has historically tended towards evaluating public figures either as villains or heroes, leaving little room for interpretation and making it clear whether the traits and goals of individual figures should be emulated or despised. The public image of some figures, including Peng Dehuai, have undergone radical reverses throughout the history of the PRC, as required by Party propagandists: Peng was portrayed as a subhuman villain during the Cultural Revolution; but, since 1978, has been evaluated as a nearly perfect Marxist, general, and public official.\n\nBy examining the qualities associated with public figures whose images have been manipulated to make those figures either exaggeratedly positive or exaggeratedly negative symbols, scholars have developed a number of assumptions about the traits and political goals generally desired by various PRC governments. Figures whose images have been manipulated to make them positive symbols will be portrayed as: coming from proletarian or semi-proletarian backgrounds; being courageous, fair, straightforward, and honest in their treatment of subordinates and superiors; leading a simple and frugal life; demonstrating great concern for the \"masses\"; achieving outstanding professional success; and, being impeccably loyal to the Party and to the communist cause. Figures whose images have been manipulated to make them negative symbols will be portrayed as: coming from backgrounds which have exposed them to \"bourgeoise\" thoughts and attitudes; adhering to all or most historical attempts to oppose political figures in the PRC who later became powerful, which are also vilified; being professionally inept, only succeeding temporarily or appearing to succeed through trickery or deception; participating in \"conspiracies\" against the correct leadership of the Party; cooperating with \"foreign countries\" (historically either the Soviet Union or the United States, depending on which is more threatening at the time); and, having numerous negative traits, such as opportunism or corruption. Usually, public figures will provide considerable examples of either positive or negative qualities, but will be made to fit either a positive or negative stereotype through exaggerating qualities which support the interpretation desired by the Party, and by omitting from the historical narrative qualities which contradict the Party's intended interpretation.\n\nThe Chinese state refers to all media work abroad as \"wai xuan,\" or \"external propaganda.\" Through its external propaganda operations, frequently directed by the United Front Work Department, China seeks to shape international perception of the Chinese government and its policies to \"allay concerns about China's economic rise, military build-up and increasing political and diplomatic influence.\" Specifically by:\n\nIn a 2008 report, the U.S. State Department's International Security Advisory Board declared that China was in the midst of a \"comprehensive strategic deception campaign,\" which was said to include \"Psychological Warfare (propaganda, deception, and coercion), Media Warfare (manipulation of public opinion domestically and internationally), and Legal Warfare (use of ‘legal regimes' to handicap the opponent in fields favorable to him).\" On its official Chinese Web site, CCTV describes itself as \"the mouthpiece of the Party and the government,\" and lists its main operations under the heading \"propaganda situation,\" referring to new foreign-language channels as \"reaching a new stage in external propaganda.\"\n\nIn 2013, a film was released accusing the United States of trying to overthrow the ruling government of China.\n\nFormer CCP leader Deng Xiaoping advised Chinese leadership to \"hide your capabilities, and bide your time.\" Most modern Chinese foreign propaganda seeks to pursue China's strategic goals while adhering to this advice. The following were common themes found in China's foreign propaganda prior to Xi Jinping:\n\n\nThe PRC uses many tactics and techniques to disseminate its propaganda themes abroad. China uses its news and media outlets, which are directly influenced by various state organizations (and ultimately the Central Propaganda Department of the CCP), to relay news stories consistent with these themes to foreign audiences. In 2009, reports emerged that China intends to invest US$6.6 billion to expand its foreign language news service. This includes plans for a 24-hour English-language news network to discuss world affairs from Beijing's point of view.\n\nSeveral Chinese state-controlled news outlets include:\n\nSince 2005, Chinese Premier Hu Jintao has promoted a \"soft power initiative\" aimed at increasing China's influence overseas through cultural and language programs. These trends have been identified by the American Council of Foreign Relations, which describes that \"Beijing is trying to convince the world of its peaceful intentions, secure the resources it needs to continue its soaring economic growth, and isolate Taiwan.\" The article points out that adverse effects of soft power, that \"China has the potential to become the 600-pound gorilla in the room,\" and that \"Chinese influence may begin to breed resentment.\"\n\nThe politburo members Li Changchun and Liu Yunshan have repeatedly stressed that Chinese propaganda should be equally spread both domestically and internationally, and Li Changchun stated that the Confucius Institutes are \"an important channel to glorify Chinese culture, to help Chinese culture spread to the world\", which is \"part of China's foreign propaganda strategy\".\n\n\"The Economist\" noted that Confucius Institutes are used to project China's soft power and win the support of an external audience, and Confucius was specifically chosen to cast an image of peace and harmony. Such centers are partially sponsored by the Chinese government, with a hands-off approach to management, its directors being directly appointed by their attached universities.\n\nIn 2009, Chinese state media launched the English-language version of the \"Global Times\", a nationalistic tabloid under the auspices of the \"People's Daily\". It was described as a part of a larger push by the Chinese government to have a greater say in international media, as well as supplanting what it considers to be biased Western media sources.\n\nIn 2009, Chinese Premier Hu Jintao initiated the \"Grand External Propaganda Strategy\", (, short: 大外宣 \"Dà Wàixuān\"), a government propaganda project budgeted at RMB 45 billion Yuan. The aim of the project is to \"Seize the initiative, gain the right to speak, maintain an active role, and grasp the power to raise the appeal of our positions in public opinion and in international broadcasting.\"\n\nIn early 2011, the Chinese government launched a million dollar advertising campaign, which was aimed to improve the \"incomplete understandings\" the American public has about China. A 60-second ad was shown at New York's Times Square, which featured Chinese personalities such as scientist Sun Jiadong, singer Liu Huan and news anchor Jing Yidan, ending with the message of \"Chinese Friendship\". Newsweek noted that the ad's great production values, but criticized it as confusing and explaining little about the featured Chinese identities.\n\nAs in the Soviet Union, the CCP under Mao Zedong took socialist realism as its basis for art, making clear its goal was the 'education' of the people in communist ideology. This included, as during the Cultural Revolution, transforming literature and art to serve these ends. Pre-revolutionary songs and operas were banned as a poisonous legacy of the past. Middle and high schools were targeted by one campaign because the students circulated romance and love stories among themselves.\n\nMaoist propaganda art has been remade and modernized for almost two decades, and old Cultural Revolution era propaganda productions have appeared in new formats such as DVDs and karaoke versions. They appear in rock and pop versions of revolutionary songs in praise of Mao, as well as T-shirts, watches, porcelain, and other memorabilia. The works of propaganda from the Cultural Revolution have been selling extremely well in recent years, largely for nostalgia, social, patriotic or entertainment purposes\n\nPropaganda songs and music, such as guoyue and revolutionary opera, have a long and storied history in the PRC, featuring prominently in the popular culture of the 1950s to the 1970s. Many of these songs were collected and performed as modern rock adaptations for several albums that were released during the 1990s, including \"Red Rock\" and \"Red Sun: Mao Zedong Praise Songs New Revolutionary Medley\". The latter sold 6–10 million copies in China. Most of the older songs praise Mao, the CCP, the 1949 revolution, the Chinese Red Army and the People's Liberation Army, the unity of the ethnic groups of China, and the various ethnic groups' devotion to Mao and the CCP.\n\n\"Red Crag\", a famous 1961 Chinese novel featuring underground communist agents fighting an espionage battle against the Kuomintang.\n\nRent Collection Courtyard, a 1965 sculpture depicting former landlord Liu Wencai as an evil landlord collecting rent from poor, although this depiction has been disputed by modern accounts.\n\n\nThe titles of some of the more well-known propaganda songs are as follows:\n\n\nMost of the songs listed above are no longer used as propaganda by the CCP, but are exhibited in mainland China as a means of reviving popular nostalgia for the \"old times\".\n\nThrough a combination of overt and covert activities, China has sought to gain strategic political influence within the American government in order to affect policies and the political process. In the U.S., China employs efforts to \"influence U.S. academics, journalists, think tank personnel and other shapers of public opinion…\" China also aims to influence businessmen and politicians.\n\nUsing a variety of methods, the PRC has recruited American agents of influence to advocate for Chinese interests in the United States. While many of these agents of influence serve China unwittingly, they can be very effective. A 1999 Congressional report found that \"the Chinese Government continues to seek influence in Congress through various means, including inviting Congressional members to visit the PRC, lobbying ethnic Chinese voters and prominent U.S. citizens, and engaging U.S. business interests to weigh in on issues of mutual concern.\" Junkets were also effectively used by the Soviet Union as part of active measures to co-opt Western politicians, journalists, and academics.\n\nChina also uses its vast market as leverage in order to persuade American companies to lobby for Chinese interests. This is especially true of companies that deal in high technology or dual-use technology, as there are significant export controls placed on such technology. According to the 1999 Cox Report, \"Executives wishing to do business in the PRC share a mutual commercial interest with the PRC in minimizing export controls on dual-use and military-related technologies. The PRC has displayed a willingness to exploit this mutuality of interest in several notoriously public cases by inducing VIPs from large U.S. companies to lobby on behalf of initiatives, such as export liberalization, on which they are aligned with the PRC.\"\n\nThrough its agents in America, the PRC has financed a number of political candidates. Katrina Leung, a Chinese spy, contributed $10,000 to the campaign of Richard Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles. When he lost his primary to Bill Simon Jr., Leung contributed $4,200 to Simon's campaign. At the direction of her Chinese handlers, Leung also contributed to the 1992 campaign of George H. W. Bush. It is estimated that Leung donated around $27,000 to politicians in the 1990s on behalf of the PRC. \nA 2012 report by the Government Accountability Institute cites other examples: It was discovered that officers from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. \"sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee before the 1996 presidential campaign.\" While these allegations have been denied by the PRC, \"Secret communications between Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Washington establish that the influence-buying plan was ‘government sanctioned…'\"\n\nIn 1996, People's Liberation Army intelligence officer Gen. Ji Shengde provided Johnny Chung, a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, with $300,000 to donate towards President Bill Clinton's reelection. Chung visited the White House over fifty times during the 1996 presidential campaign, and was responsible for over $400,000 of contributions to the DNC. This money was returned after the election.\n\nAccording to a report published by Bloomberg, China has approved the creation of a new broadcasting channel called \"Voice of China\", mirroring the \"Voice of America\" operated by the US. The China Central Television, China Radio International and China National Radio will be folded into one operation, with the objective to improve and project China's image abroad.\n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in 1783 and Lord Advocate in 1784. He became Member of Parliament for Glasgow Burghs in the same year. He was Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice General from 1789 to 1808, where he sat as \"Lord Succoth\".\n\nOn his resignation in 1808, he was created a baronet, and resided at Garscube House, about four miles from Glasgow on the banks of the river Kelvin.

As such, the title \"Lord Succoth\" was not hereditable. The honorific \"The Much Honoured\" references a feudal barony (\"of Succoth\").

These include a costly nuclear war, Kreel choking to death on a chicken bone, a happy ending selling \"I survived the Red Mercury war\" baseball caps, both pilots being served as the main course at Kreel's grand victory ceremony, or Hatch being brainwashed by the Red Mercury and becoming Kreel's willing servant and destroying the mothership and remaining planetary defense forces.\n\nAssociate producer/designer Mike Giam explained how the game's basic concept was formed: \"We looked at shooters like \"After Burner\" and \"StarFox\", and we juxtaposed their arcade feeling with the freedom of a computer flight sim.\"\n\n\"Warhawk\" was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics lauded the precise controls, music, graphics, sound effects, and most especially the freedom and variety afforded by the open 3D world and complex flight controls, though some felt the game was too short.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1950766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950766", "title": "Graph isomorphism problem", "text": "Graph isomorphism problem\n\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe problem is not known to be solvable in polynomial time nor to be NP-complete, and therefore may be in the computational complexity class NP-intermediate. It is known that the graph isomorphism problem is in the low hierarchy of class NP, which implies that it is not NP-complete unless the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. At the same time, isomorphism for many special classes of graphs can be solved in polynomial time, and in practice graph isomorphism can often be solved efficiently.\n\nThis problem is a special case of the subgraph isomorphism problem, which asks whether a given graph \"G\" contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to another given graph \"H\"; this problem is known to be NP-complete. It is also known to be a special case of the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric group.\n\nIn the area of image recognition it is known as the exact graph matching.\n\nThe best currently accepted theoretical algorithm is due to , and is based on the earlier work by combined with a \"subfactorial\" algorithm of V. N. Zemlyachenko . The algorithm has run time 2 for graphs with \"n\" vertices and relies on the classification of finite simple groups. Without the CFSG theorem, a slightly weaker bound \n\nIn November 2015, Babai announced a quasipolynomial time algorithm for all graphs, that is, one with running time formula_1 for some fixed formula_2. On January 4, 2017, Babai retracted the quasi-polynomial claim and stated a sub-exponential time bound instead after Harald Helfgott discovered a flaw in the proof. On January 9, 2017, Babai announced a correction (published in full on January 19) and restored the quasi-polynomial claim, with Helfgott confirming the fix. Helfgott further claims that one can take , so the running time is . The new proof has not been fully peer-reviewed yet.\n\nThere are several competing practical algorithms for graph isomorphism, such as those due to , , and . While they seem to perform well on random graphs, a major drawback of these algorithms is their exponential time performance in the worst case.\n\nThe graph isomorphism problem is computationally equivalent to the problem of computing the automorphism group of a graph, and is weaker than the permutation group isomorphism problem and the permutation group intersection problem. For the latter two problems, obtained complexity bounds similar to that for graph isomorphism.\n\nA number of important special cases of the graph isomorphism problem have efficient, polynomial-time solutions:\n\nSince the graph isomorphism problem is neither known to be NP-complete nor known to be tractable, researchers have sought to gain insight into the problem by defining a new class GI, the set of problems with a polynomial-time Turing reduction to the graph isomorphism problem. If in fact the graph isomorphism problem is solvable in polynomial time, GI would equal P.\n\nAs is common for complexity classes within the polynomial time hierarchy, a problem is called GI-hard if there is a polynomial-time Turing reduction from any problem in GI to that problem, i.e., a polynomial-time solution to a GI-hard problem would yield a polynomial-time solution to the graph isomorphism problem (and so all problems in GI). A problem formula_3 is called complete for GI, or GI-complete, if it is both GI-hard and a polynomial-time solution to the GI problem would yield a polynomial-time solution to formula_3.\n\nThe graph isomorphism problem is contained in both NP and co-AM. GI is contained in and low for Parity P, as well as contained in the potentially much smaller class SPP. That it lies in Parity P means that the graph isomorphism problem is no harder than determining whether a polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machine has an even or odd number of accepting paths. GI is also contained in and low for ZPP. This essentially means that an efficient Las Vegas algorithm with access to an NP oracle can solve graph isomorphism so easily that it gains no power from being given the ability to do so in constant time.\n\nThere are a number of classes of mathematical objects for which the problem of isomorphism is a GI-complete problem. A number of them are graphs endowed with additional properties or restrictions:\nA class of graphs is called GI-complete if recognition of isomorphism for graphs from this subclass is a GI-complete problem. The following classes are GI-complete:\n\nMany classes of digraphs are also GI-complete.\n\nThere are other nontrivial GI-complete problems in addition to isomorphism problems.\n\n\n have shown a probabilistic checker for programs for graph isomorphism. Suppose \"P\" is a claimed polynomial-time procedure that checks if two graphs are isomorphic, but it is not trusted. To check if \"G\" and \"H\" are isomorphic:\n\n\nThis procedure is polynomial-time and gives the correct answer if \"P\" is a correct program for graph isomorphism. If \"P\" is not a correct program, but answers correctly on \"G\" and \"H\", the checker will either give the correct answer, or detect invalid behaviour of \"P\".\nIf \"P\" is not a correct program, and answers incorrectly on \"G\" and \"H\", the checker will detect invalid behaviour of \"P\" with high probability, or answer wrong with probability 2.\n\nNotably, \"P\" is used only as a blackbox.\n\nGraphs are commonly used to encode structural information in many fields, including computer vision and pattern recognition, and graph matching, i.e., identification of similarities between graphs, is an important tools in these areas. In these areas graph isomorphism problem is known as the exact graph matching.\n\nIn cheminformatics and in mathematical chemistry, graph isomorphism testing is used to identify a chemical compound within a chemical database. Also, in organic mathematical chemistry graph isomorphism testing is useful for generation of molecular graphs and for computer synthesis.\n\nChemical database search is an example of graphical data mining, where the graph canonization approach is often used. In particular, a number of identifiers for chemical substances, such as SMILES and InChI, designed to provide a standard and human-readable way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web, use canonization step in their computation, which is essentially the canonization of the graph which represents the molecule.\n\nIn electronic design automation graph isomorphism is the basis of the Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) circuit design step, which is a verification whether the electric circuits represented by a circuit schematic and an integrated circuit layout are the same.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She may have been the wife of Theseus and mother to his son Hippolytus, but differing sources claim this was Hippolyta.\n\nThere are various accounts of the manner in which Theseus became possessed of her, and of her subsequent fortunes.\n\nIn one version, during Heracles' ninth labour, which was to obtain the Girdle of Hippolyta, when he captured the Amazons' capital of Themiscyra, his companion Theseus, king of Athens, abducted Antiope and brought her to his home (or she was captured by Heracles and then given by him to Theseus). According to Pausanias, Antiope fell in love with Theseus and betrayed the Amazons of her own free will. They were eventually married and she gave birth to a son, Hippolytus, who was named after Antiope's sister. Soon after, the Amazons attacked Athens in an attempt to rescue Antiope and to take back Hippolyta's girdle; however, in a battle near the Areopagus they were defeated by Athenian forces under Theseus's leadership. During this conflict, known as the Attic War, Antiope was accidentally shot dead by an Amazon named Molpadia, who, in turn, was killed by Theseus. The tombs of both Antiope and Molpadia were shown in Athens, according to Pausanias.\n\nAccording to some sources, the cause for the Amazons' attack on Athens was the fact that Theseus had abandoned Antiope and planned to marry Phaedra. Antiope was furious about this and decided to attack them on their wedding day. She promised to kill every person in attendance; however, she was slain instead by Theseus himself, fulfilling an oracle's prophecy to that effect. Ovid mentions that Theseus killed Antiope despite the fact that she was pregnant.\n\nAn alternate version of the myth relates all of the facts concerning Antiope (abduction by Theseus, their marriage, birth of Hippolytus, her being left behind in favour of Phaedra) not of her, but of Hippolyte. In various accounts of this version, the subsequent attack on Athens either does not occur at all or is led by Orithyia.\n\n\n\n"}

Drayton was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry.\n\nFour years later, Drayton resigned from the US Army and became a civil engineer for railroad construction in Charleston, Louisville, and Cincinnati for two years before he returned to plantation life. He was a captain in the state militia for five years.\n\nDrayton was elected to the South Carolina state legislature and was an outspoken supporter of states rights and slavery. He eventually owned 102 slaves at Fish Hill Plantation, which his wife had brought to their marriage. While a state senator, Drayton also was President of the Charleston & Savannah Railroad from 1853 until 1856.\n\nIn 1832 Drayton married Catherine Pope of a wealthy planter family in Edisto, South Carolina. Her family owned Fish Hall Plantation on Hilton Head Island. The Draytons had several children. Two of Drayton's sons also served in the Civil War.\n\nWith the coming of war, Jefferson Davis, the new President of the Confederate States of America, appointed Drayton as a brigadier general in September 1861 and placed him in command of the military district at Port Royal, South Carolina. Drayton subsequently used \"Fish Hall Plantation\", which his wife owned, as headquarters in the defense of Hilton Head Island until 1861. Drayton assigned many of his own 102 slaves on the island to construct defenses and do other work to support the Confederates.\n\nAt the Battle of Port Royal later that year, troops under his command at Fort Beauregard and Fort Walker came under attack by ships of the Union Navy, including the USS \"Pocahontas\", commanded by his brother, Percival Drayton. Thomas Drayton's son, Lieutenant William Drayton, also fought with the Confederates in defense of the forts. After a lengthy bombardment, both forts fell to the Union attackers, who subsequently occupied much of the region. They gained their first deepwater port in coastal Carolina.\n\nIn 1862, Drayton was assigned command of an infantry brigade composed of the 15th South Carolina Infantry, the 3d Battalion S.C. Inf. and three Georgia infantry regiments, the 50th and 51st and Phillips' Georgia Legion. The brigade joined the Army of Northern Virginia after the Seven Days Battles and became part of the Right Wing of the Army of Northern Virginia under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. Drayton led his brigade to Second Bull Run and in the Maryland Campaign.\n\nAfter the Battle of Antietam, Robert E. Lee became displeased with Drayton's performance. His brigade was broken up and its regiments transferred to other brigades, and Drayton himself was sent to the Trans-Mississippi Theater. Drayton had failed to get his brigade into action at Second Bull Run, and it was driven from the field in panic at South Mountain and Antietam. Lee complained that Drayton was unable to keep his brigade properly organized, failing to file reports and returns, and in each battle the brigade had been engaged in, most of its colonels were AWOL, leaving the regiments commanded by inexperienced majors and captains. He was transferred to the Western Theater to command a brigade in Sterling Price's army. During the final two years of the war, he mainly performed administrative duties in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, although he did briefly command a division in early 1864.\n\nFollowing the surrender of Confederate forces in the spring of 1865, Drayton moved to Dooly County, Georgia, where he managed a plantation. Destitute and unable to reclaim his confiscated property in South Carolina, in 1871, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he sold insurance for a living. Drayton was president of the South Carolina Immigrant Society until shortly before his death in Florence, South Carolina, at the age of 81. He was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Charlotte.\n\nDrayton is commemorated by a historical marker erected in 1985 by the state of South Carolina near Hilton Head in Beaufort County.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1950816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950816", "title": "Dana Simpson", "text": "Dana Simpson\n\nDana Claire Simpson is an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the syndicated comic strip \"Phoebe and Her Unicorn\", as well as the long-running web comic \"Ozy and Millie\". Other works created by Simpson include the political commentary cartoon \"I Drew This\" and the alternate reality drama comic \"Raine Dog\".\n\nSimpson was born in Pullman, Washington, and then lived in the Seattle area for most of her life. She is a graduate of The Evergreen State College.\n\nSimpson considers herself an artist from an early age, drawing comic strips as young as five years old as part of making her own homemade newspaper. As she grew up, she began drawing inspiration from \"Peanuts\", \"The Simpsons\" and \"Pogo\".\n\nIn her 20s, she came out as transgender. She currently lives in Santa Barbara, California with her husband David Brodbeck. \n\nThe webcomic \"Ozy and Millie\", Simpson's first published comic strip (published under \"D.C. Simpson\"), began running regularly in 1998 while she was attending Washington State University as a graduate student. The strip centered on Ozy (an Arctic fox) and Millie (a red fox) as they and their friends dealt with everyday elementary school issues and more surreal situations. For her work on \"Ozy and Millie\", Simpson was a finalist for the 1998 Scripps-Howard Foundation Charles M. Schulz College Cartoonist Award. The comic went on to win the 1999 College Media Advisers award for Best Strip Cartoon and the 2002 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards for Best Anthropomorphic Comic. It also won the Ursa Major Award for both \"Best Anthropomorphic Other Work\" for 2002 and for \"Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip\" for 2006 and 2007. Simpson continued the strip for ten years while attempting to seek syndication for the title, but could not secure any deal. The final regular strip was published on December 23, 2008.\n\nSimpson's second published comic strip, \"I Drew This\", was primarily about politics and proudly admits to its liberal orientation. It is somewhat autobiographical, in that one of the main characters is the author (the other is Joe, the Liberal Eagle) and its focus is often the author's own musings. \"I Drew This\" began life in the Washington State University \"Daily Evergreen\" in January 2004, while Simpson was attending graduate school. Like \"Ozy and Millie\", this comic is part of the webcomics portal Keenspot, beginning November 2006. Material from \"I Drew This\" was included in \"\". The May 16, 2005 edition, \"Teaching Gravity\", featured the first reference to the theory of intelligent falling. \"insert title here\" and \"I Drew This\" (a complete collection of the strips) are both available for purchase on Lulu.\n\nFollowing the end of \"Ozy and Millie\", Simpson provided illustrations for children's books. She also submitted a new comic idea to Amazon.com's \"Comic Strip Superstar\" contest in 2009, entitled \"Girl\", which was selected the winner and received a publishing contract from Andrews McMeel Universal. \"Girl\" centered around an unnamed girl with a vivid imagination interacting with forest creatures. The strip's launch was somewhat delayed; according to Simpson, this was imposed by the syndicate due to its reluctance to launch two \"talking animal\" strips at the same time, as well as its request for further edits. Simpson also noted she only had a limited number of \"Girl\" strips ready and needed more time to draw out more.\n\nDuring this time, Simpson had drawn one \"Girl\" strip that included a unicorn. Simpson knew shortly after drawing this strip that the unicorn was a necessary character to make her comic work. \"Girl\" was completely retooled and re-imagined as \"Heavenly Nostrils,\", which is about a nine-year-old girl named Phoebe (essentially the same character as from \"Girl\") who comes across a magical unicorn named Marigold Heavenly Nostrils who is enraptured by her reflection in a pond; Phoebe accidentally hits her with a rock, breaking the spell, and as part of one wish Marigold grants her, Phoebe asks for Marigold to become her best friend.\n\n\"Heavenly Nostrils,\" was scheduled to debut on GoComics April 23, 2012, but debuted a day early on April 22, 2012. The strip entered into print syndication across 100 papers starting on March 30, 2015; the title of the strip was changed to \"Phoebe and her Unicorn\" for print syndication.\n\nWithin the strip, Simpson drew inspiration from her real life. Phoebe herself is loosely based on Simpson's own personality. Phoebe's best friend, Max, is based on Simpson's husband David. Dakota, a fellow schoolmate of Phoebe who initially teases her until she learns about the unicorn, was an amalgamation of several students that had given Simpson trouble when she was younger, but also incorporates elements of her younger sister Nicole. Phoebe's parents are based on Simpson's friends who have become parents themselves but \"they’re also still the same weird people they were before they had kids\". Marigold is based partially on the unicorn character in the work \"The Last Unicorn\" by Peter S. Beagle. Marigold's name was based the results of using Simpson's own name in an online unicorn name generator.\n\nThe strip has been favorably compared to \"Calvin & Hobbes\" with a feminine slant; in contrast to \"Calvin & Hobbes\", where the character of Hobbes is only a stuffed tiger doll that Calvin imagines is alive, Marigold the unicorn exists as a living creature in Phoebe's world, but hides her form through a \"Shield of Boringness\" that makes her appear unremarkable to other characters in the strip.\n\nThe strips have been published in the following books:\n\nOther books:\n\nOn January 16, 2009, Simpson posted the first page of \"Raine Dog\", a graphic novel which follows an anthropomorphic dog living among humans with other recently liberated house dogs. The most recent update was in January 2010. Simpson abandoned the project \"for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nSimpson announced that she is writing and illustrating a book about her transition, targeted for middle-school students, titled \"Only You’re Different\". She also illustrated a picture book, \"I'm Not a Girl\", written by Maddox Lyons, a 12-year-old transgender boy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1950827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950827", "title": "Mombi", "text": "Mombi\n\nMombi is a fictional character in L. Frank Baum's classic children's series of Oz Books. She is the most significant antagonist in the second Oz book \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\" (1904), and is alluded to in other works. Mombi plays a very important role in the fictional history of Oz.\n\nThe character was originally presented as a lowly hag who had enchanted Princess Ozma in order to prevent her from ascending to the throne. Later in the series, L. Frank Baum specified that she had once conquered and ruled the Gillikin Country, as the Wicked Witch of the North, only to be deposed by the Good Witch of the North.\n\nFurthermore, Mombi had enslaved Ozma's father (King Pastoria) and grandfather, thereby removing the Royal Family of Oz, and enabling herself and the Wicked Witches of the East, West and South to conquer and divide the land between them.\n\nAfter forcing her to disenchant Princess Ozma, Glinda the Good Witch of the South made Mombi drink a powerful draught that stripped the old witch of all her magic powers.\n\nMombi didn't make any further appearances in L. Frank Baum's books. In Ruth Plumly Thompson's \"The Lost King of Oz\", the witch raises havoc once again, and at the end of the book, in a rare act of Ozite capital punishment, Mombi is ruthlessly doused with water and melts away like the Wicked Witch of the West, so that nothing is left of her but her buckled shoes. L. Frank Baum never said that all witches in Oz would die upon contact with water, but Ruth Plumly Thompson and several subsequent writers such as Rachel Payes had made that conclusion.\n\nAfter arriving in Oz and proclaiming himself as the new dominant ruler, the Wizard made arrangements in three secret visits to an irrelevant witch known as simply Mombi. She lived in Oz's northern quadrant and practiced dark magic, casting curses and spells upon her enemies. Since the complex fall of Oz's deceased former King Pastoria, the Wizard took the King's baby daughter Princess Ozma, and handed her over to the old witch in secrecy. Thus, leaving no heir to Oz's imperial throne. Upon receiving her, Mombi kept the infant hidden away. To disguise her from ever being recognized by the people in Oz, Mombi cleverly transformed the princess into a young boy she nicknamed Tip. (transformations seemed to be Mombi's forte). Having been the jailor of Ozma's father and grandfather before, Mombi treated Tip as a slave, too, as \"he\" grew up.\n\nMombi's first match was the Good Witch of the North. After freeing the Gillikins from Mombi's clutches, the Good Witch forbade any other witch to live in her domain. Even after her defeat, Mombi was still a survivor. She made herself appear to be a lowly wizardess and settled down on a quiet farmland which included corn fields, a four-horned cow, and some pigs.\n\nOne day Mombi visited a Crooked Magician called Dr. Nikidik, and purchased the Powder of Life from him, which she used to bring Jack Pumpkinhead to life. Tip created Jack to scare her, so as punishment Mombi brewed a potion that would turn Tip into a marble statue. That night, Tip ran away and took Jack with him. When General Jinjur's Army of Revolt conquered the Emerald City, Jinjur feared that the deposed Scarecrow would return with the Tin Woodman to take back the throne of the kingdom. Jinjur asked Mombi for help and she agreed, hoping to recapture Tip, who had joined the Scarecrow.\n\nAfter leaving the Gillikin Country to join forces with Jinjur, the new self-appointed Queen of Oz, Mombi was no longer under the jurisdiction of the Good Witch of the North. Scarecrow went to Glinda to ask for help in regaining the throne, but she refused and explained that Princess Ozma was the rightful ruler. She then set out to learn the fate of Pastoria's daughter.\n\nMombi tried to trick and escape from Glinda with a series of transformations ranging from the maid Jellia Jamb to a Rose and ultimately a Griffin, but the former Wicked Witch of the North was no match for the Good Sorceress of the South. Indeed, Glinda turned out to be an even tougher adversary than the Good Witch of the North. She captured Mombi and forced her to reveal the princess's location. Mombi restored Ozma to her proper form, and Glinda took away Mombi's magical powers. Just before being disenchanted, Tip promised to provide for Mombi in her old age, despite her fiendish actions. L. Frank Baum wrote Ozma as a gentle, forgiving and compassionate individual; not a vengeful ruler.\n\nIn Ruth Plumly Thompson's \"The Lost King of Oz\", Dorothy suggests that Mombi be put out with a pail of water for her misdeeds, and Princess Ozma herself commands it. L. Frank Baum never suggested that water could destroy all witches, but Thompson certainly surmised as much. Moreover, L. Frank Baum's original Dorothy and Ozma would never have had anyone executed; Dorothy was unwilling to kill the Wicked Witch of the West even for the sake of seeing Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", while Ozma was unwilling to destroy her enemies even when they were on the verge of conquering her entire land in Baum's \"The Emerald City of Oz\". Above all, the events in Thompson's book directly contradict Baum's specification that Mombi would be provided for by Ozma herself in her old age.\n\n\"Mombi\" appears in \"Lucky Bucky in Oz\", when Jack Pumpkinhead's magic painting of the old witch comes off a wall and causes trouble.\n\nMarch Laumer reversed her \"death\" from Ruth Plumly Thompson's book, regenerating and reforming the witch into a harmless character in his revisionist \"A Farewell to Oz\". Similarly, in Oziana magazine, the official fiction-journal of the International Wizard of Oz Club, issue #38, the story \"Executive Decisions,\" by David Tai, reconciles the account in \"The Lost King of Oz\" with the Ozma that Baum described, demonstrating that, in fact, she did not have Mombi executed as everyone was led to believe.\n\nMombi and Tip make a cameo appearance in Gregory Maguire's second Oz novel, \"Son of a Witch\" (though only Tip is named). In Maguire's fourth Oz novel, \"Out of Oz\", Mombi (spelled \"Mombey\") plays a more significant role. In this book, Mombey has become the ruler of Munchkinland, which is at war with the rest of \"Loyal Oz\"; the Munchkinland armies are under the command of General Jinjuria. Maguire presents Mombey as a powerful woman who changes her appearance every day, probably a reference to the film \"Return to Oz\", in which Mombi is conflated with the head-swapping Evite Princess Langwidere. Tip tells Rain (granddaughter of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West) that Mombey traveled across the sands and learned how to change the shape of her head and her body from \"some second-rate duchess\" in \"one of the duchy principalities, I think it was Ev\". As in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", Mombi/Mombey has enchanted the Princess Ozma into the form of the boy Tip; however, in Maguire's Oz the enchantment lasts for nearly a century. Mombey kidnaps Liir (son of Elphaba and father of Rain) and transforms him into an elephant. Later, Mombey's forces attack the Emerald City with the aid of dragons. At a subsequent conference for terms of surrender, Mombey uses a spell called \"To Call the Lost Forward\" in order to return Liir to his proper form; the spell inadvertently also returns Tip to his true form (Ozma) and restores Rain's natural green skin. Although the circumstances of the spell are quite different from those in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", details of it closely resemble Baum's description and the illustration of Mombi's spell by John R. Neill.\n\nThe Wicked Witch of the West is given the similar name, \"Momba\" in the 1910 silent film \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", but is based on that character, not Mombi. A witch named Mombi also appears in the 1914 film \"His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz\". The character resembles W. W. Denslow's depiction of the Wicked Witch of the West (complete with eyepatch, pigtails and umbrella), and her role in the story is based on the Wicked Witch of the West in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and inspired the witch Blinkie in the novel \"The Scarecrow of Oz\".\n\nMombi appears in the 1969 feature film \"The Wonderful Land of Oz\", played by Zisca, whose real name is Franzisca Baum, but is not related to L. Frank Baum. She sings the eerie song, \"The Powder of Life,\" proudly proclaiming herself as a witch and not minding at all that Tip has called her one. Her appearance is largely modeled on Margaret Hamilton's in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), but with her hair more down, dark circles under her eyes, a paler appearance and a more strained gait. There is purple highlighting in her clothes, emphasizing her Gillikin origins, in keeping with Baum's books.\n\nMombi is the main antagonist of the 1974 animated film \"Journey Back to Oz\", which is a sequel to Victor Flemming's \"The Wizard of Oz\" and is loosely based on \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\". In the film, Mombi (voiced by Ethel Merman) tries to overthrow the Scarecrow with magical green elephants. When her plans are thwarted by Dorothy, Glinda and \"Pumpkinhead\", she transforms herself into a rose, as in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\"; however, in this adaptation, the rose is trampled by one of the elephants, and Mombi is killed. She sings two comical solos in the film, titled \"An Elephant Never Forgets\" and \"If You're Gonna Be a Witch (Be a Witch!)\", in Ethel Merman's trademark brash style.\n\nIn the 1981 videotaped production of \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", Mombi was played by Wendy Lehr. She performed her hunched over, and kicked each leg out as she walked. She could not disguise this when she impersonated Jellia Jamb, so Rana Haugen matched Lehr's walk in this scene. In this version, Mombi regularly refers to Tip by his full name Tippetarius, unlike anyone else, which gives away her Jellia disguise to him. Tip arouses her anger by referring to her as a witch and she grabs him and threatens to beat him for saying so, but then recalls that she cannot get away with permanently harming him; her grab becomes a mock-motherly caress as she assures him \"I'm not a witch. You know that witchcraft is forbidden. I'm just an old Gillikin woman who sometimes makes herself a homemade remedy,\" after which she tosses him aside and says nastily, \"Arthritis, you know!\"\n\nIn the 1985 movie \"Return to Oz\", the character of Mombi (portrayed by Jean Marsh) was combined with head-exchanging Princess Langwidere from the third book in the series, \"Ozma of Oz\" and she is renamed Princess Mombi. Here, she is portrayed as a dark-haired, deranged and evil middle-aged sorceress. She is a coward at heart who grovels before the Nome King and begs for her life when he is displeased with her. She makes a deal with the Nome King for if she trapped Princess Ozma in her enchanted mirror, he would make her a princess and gives her thirty beautiful heads (two of them are portrayed by Sophie Ward and Fiona Victory) which she could switch depending on her mood. He also gives her the Emerald City after he took away the emeralds. Mombi also guards the Powder of Life. When Dorothy encounters \"Princess Mombi\" in her palace, Mombi develops a fondness for Dorothy's head and locks her in the tower, planning to remove her head and take it once the girl has reached adulthood. Dorothy however escapes and steals the Powder of Life from a case which also contains Mombi's true head. Unfortunately, she awakens the head, which screams Dorothy's name, thereby awakening the other heads in turn, which all begin screaming her name. Ultimately, all the screaming awakens Mombi's headless body, which relentlessly pursues Dorothy, although the girl manages to escape. Donning her true head, Mombi sends her sinister minions the Wheelers after Dorothy. At the climax of the film, the Nome King imprisons Mombi in a magical cage for failing him. Like in Baum's original book, Mombi is stripped of all her magical powers at the end of the story (except by Princess Ozma, rather than Glinda, in this film). Though Princess Ozma forgives an imprisoned Mombi. On Earth, her counterpart is Nurse Wilson, the head nurse at the mental clinic that is run by Dr. J.B. Worley. The two of them have been using the machines at the clinic to secretly give their patients brain damage. When a power outage occurred during a thunderstorm, Nurse Wilson chased after Dorothy and loses her. After Dorothy returned to Kansas, she sees that Nurse Wilson was arrested and locked up in a cage on a horse buggy while Dr. Worley was mentioned to have perished in the fire caused by the thunderstorm.\n\nIn the 1986 anime adaptation \"Ozu no Mahōtsukai\", Mombi takes on a middle aged, heavier appearance. She has purple hair in this series, in keeping with her Gillikin roots.\n\nThe Witch of the North appears in the TV series \"Once Upon a Time\", portrayed by Karen Holness. However, she is not mentioned to be Wicked, though a later Wicked Witch of the North is mentioned, leaving it unclear if this is the Witch of the North gone bad or a different witch.\n\nIn the TV series \"Emerald City\", Mombi is portrayed by Fiona Shaw, a witch posing as an apothecary, living in a town with no name, she kept Tip captive in her house, forcing her to switch genders through a black elixir.\n\nIn \"The Oz Kids\", Mombi restores her powers and kidnaps Glinda, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, the Nome King, Dorothy, and her husband, Zeb, in a bid to take over Oz. She also pursues their children, who attempt to keep Mombi from accessing the Magic Belt. Dot, Dorothy's daughter, manages to trick Mombi into drinking from the forbidden fountain, which causes Mombi to lose her memory. Dot then tells Mombi that she's an kindly old woman who loves children, who lives in a castle in the sky.\n"}

The engagement took place outside the French port of Toulon.\n\nThe clash occurred when a French fleet under Vice-Admiral Maxime Julien Émeriau de Beauverger took advantage of a favourable wind and the temporary absence of the British blockading force, to leave port to carry out exercises. Émeriau abandoned the exercises when the wind changed, but while returning to port his rear came under attack from the recently returned British inshore squadron. The British attack was reinforced by newly arrived ships from the main fleet, but the French were able to escape into Toulon after exchanging cannon fire with the British. Casualties on both sides were light.\n\nThe French Mediterranean Fleet had been blockaded in their principal base at Toulon for several years. Their commander from early 1811, Vice-Admiral Maxime Julien Émeriau de Beauverger made occasional sorties from the port in order to exercise his fleet, but preferred to avoid any chance of action with the patrolling British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew. Émeriau instead preferred to make brief sorties when the wind was in his favour and the British were absent, undertake exercises, and then return to Toulon when Pellew's fleet appeared. Pellew in turn hoped to tempt the French out and then cut them off from their homeport, forcing a decisive battle upon them. To this end he kept the main part of his fleet, including his largest ships, some distance from Toulon, and relied on a small inshore squadron composed of 74-gun ships to maintain the blockade. Strong gales in late October 1813 had forced both the inshore squadron and the main battlefleet off their stations, and Émeriau decided to make a sortie to exercise his fleet off Cape Sicié.\n\nThe French fleet, consisting of between twelve and fourteen ships of the line, six frigates and a schooner duly put to sea at 9:30 am on the morning of 5 November. Émeriau, flying his flag aboard the \"Impérial\", was assisted in his manoeuvres by a strong east-north-east wind and made for the usual exercise area. The British inshore squadron, commanded by Captain Henry Heathcote, had only arrived back on their station the night before, and the main British fleet under Sir Edward Pellew was some distance to the south. Heathcote, commanding four 74-gun ships, was observing the French movements, when at 11:30 am, the wind suddenly changed direction, shifting to the north-west. Concerned about the sudden arrival of the British and unfavourable winds, Émeriau abandoned the exercises and ordered the fleet to make for Toulon. The advanced squadron of the French fleet, commanded by Rear-Admiral Julien Cosmao-Kerjulien and consisting of five ships of the line and four heavy frigates, now found itself to leeward, beating back to port. Heathcote immediately saw a chance to cut off the French rear, and ordered his squadron to attack.\n\nHeathcote, commanding , took his ship in and at 12:34 pm passed the French rear, firing on them with her port guns, as the French stood in for Toulon on the starboard tack. The rest of the squadron, joined by the 74-gun from Pellew's fleet, followed in succession. The British ships then turned about and tacked across in the opposite direction, cannonading the fleeing French with their starboard batteries. At 1:00 pm the advance ships of Pellew's fleet, , and arrived and opened fire on the rear-most French ship, the \"Wagram\". The British ships tacked and wore, exchanging fire with the French until the wind carried Cosmao-Kerjulien's squadron under the safety of the shore batteries covering the approach to Toulon.\n\nCasualties and damage on both sides were light. On the British side, twelve men were wounded by French fire, while one man was killed and another two wounded in accidents, bringing total British casualties to 15. \"Caledonia\" sustained a shot to her mainmast and three or four in her hull, as well as some damage to her shrouds and backstays. Her launch and barge were also destroyed. The French had a total of 17 men wounded to varying degrees, mostly aboard the \"Agamemnon\", which suffered damage to her masts, hull and rigging, and had nine men wounded. The \"Borée\" had her wheel shot away, and the frigates \"Pénélope\" and \"Melpomène\" were damaged in their sails, masts and rigging. Pellew sailed for Menorca soon afterwards, reducing the inshore squadron to a minimum, but Émeriau declined to come out.\n\na.

He is best known as the original drummer and founding member of the rock band Chicago, a tenure which lasted from February 1967 to May 1990.\n\nDaniel Peter Seraphine was born in Chicago to John and Mary Seraphine. The family lived in the Dunning neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. He started playing drums at the age of nine while attending St. Priscilla Catholic grade school. When he was 15 years old, Seraphine withdrew from Steinmetz High School. Outside of school he joined a local gang called the JPs.\n\nIn December 1965, after deciding to give up on making a living playing drums, he got an invitation to join a band called Jimmy Ford and the Executives, Dick Clark's road band. Already in the band were Terry Kath on bass and Walter Parazaider on saxophone. After being let go from Jimmy Ford and the Executives when it merged with another local band, Little Artie and the Pharaohs (under the new name, The Mob) the three of them were invited to join a cover band called The Missing Links.\n\nHe studied privately with famed percussionist Bob Tilles at DePaul University, where future members of Chicago were also studying. Seraphine cites his influences as Buddy Rich, Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, Grady Tate, Ringo Starr, Mitch Mitchell, and Hal Blaine.\n\nHe continued his education with big band drummer Chuck Flores, followed by two years of study under jazz drummer Jo Jones (also known as Papa Jo Jones) in the mid-1970s.\n\nEarly in 1967, Seraphine approached his two new friends Walter Parazaider (saxophone and woodwinds) and Terry Kath about leaving the cover band they were in and starting a new band with a horn section. Kath switched from bass guitar to guitar, his first love. After the addition of Lee Loughnane (trumpet), James Pankow (trombone), Robert Lamm (keyboards) and Peter Cetera (bass), the band began performing initially as a cover band called The Big Thing (sometimes called The Big Sound), before settling on Chicago Transit Authority, which was soon shortened to \"Chicago\" because of threatened legal action by the actual Chicago Transit Authority.\n\nTheir producer and manager, James William Guercio, moved the group to Los Angeles where they landed a regular gig at the Whisky a Go Go. They subsequently obtained a contract with Columbia Records and recorded their first album — a double album — in two weeks. This eponymous album \"Chicago Transit Authority\" was released in 1969. Second only to the Beach Boys in terms of \"Billboard\" singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago are one of the longest-running and most successful pop and rock groups.\n\nSeraphine co-wrote several songs for the band: \"Lowdown\" (a Top 40 hit for the band), the instrumentals \"Prelude to Aire\", \"Aire\", and \"Devil's Sweet\" from the album \"Chicago VII\", \"Little One\" and \"Take Me Back to Chicago\" from \"Chicago XI\", \"Street Player\" from \"Chicago XIII\", \"Show Me the Way\", \"Birthday Boy\" and \"Sonny Think Twice. His writing partner was often David \"Hawk\" Wolinski, the keyboardist for Rufus featuring Chaka Khan. \"Street Player\" was sampled by The Bucketheads for the dance hit \"The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall into My Mind)\", and later by rapper Pitbull for the hit \"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\" from the album \"Rebelution\". The song samples \"75, Brazil Street\" by Nicola Fasano versus Pat Rich, which itself samples \"Street Player\". \"I Know You Want Me\" has also been featured in \"Dance Central\", the dancing game for Kinect, \"Dance Dance Revolution X2\" for PlayStation 2, and \"SingStar Dance\", the dancing game for PlayStation Move.\n\nSeraphine and Wolinski also started a production company called Street Sense Productions. Seraphine used his home studio to record demos. A deal was signed with Epic Records with the idea of fostering new talent.\n\nIn 1974, during the peak of the band's career, Seraphine co-founded B'Ginnings, a music venue with capacity of almost 1,000, in the northwest suburbs of Chicago.\n\nSeraphine was let go from Chicago in May 1990, after disagreements with the band that were chronicled in his book \"Street Player: My Chicago Story\". After his departure, veteran session drummer Tris Imboden joined the band in time for \"Twenty 1\".\n\nIn early 2006, Danny Seraphine debuted a new band, California Transit Authority (CTA), featuring himself on drums, Marc Bonilla on lead guitar, Mick Mahan on bass guitar, Ed Roth and Peter Fish on keyboards, Mike Wallace on guitar, and Tower of Power singer Larry Braggs on vocals. Seraphine and Bonilla initially put the band together to play for several charity benefit shows. Their repertoire included several Chicago songs.\n\nCTA released their first studio album, \"Full Circle\", on August 14, 2007, followed by a tour of the United States. The band's second album \"Sacred Ground\" was released on March 21, 2013.\n\n2009 saw the release of \"Lonely Street\", a film for which Seraphine served as an executive producer and the music supervisor. In 2010 he published his aforementioned autobiography \"Street Player: My Chicago Story\". In the same year, he released the biographical and instructional DVD \"The Art of Jazz Rock Drumming\" produced by The Drum Channel.\n\nSeraphine has been ranked by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine as one of the top 100 drummers of all time. In 2010, Seraphine received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Cape Breton Drum Festival. In 2011, he also won a Lifetime Achievement Award, Montreal Drum Festival. Additionally, he was recognized by the ASCAP as a co-writer of Pitbull's \"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\".\n\nOn May 9, 2015, the City of Chicago dedicated the 3500 block of North Normandy Avenue on Chicago's northwest side \"Honorary Danny Seraphine Way\".\n\nSeraphine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Chicago on April 8, 2016.\n\nSeraphine plays DW drums, pedals & hardware, Aquarian drumheads, Zildjian cymbals and drumsticks. He had previously endorsed Rogers, Slingerland and Yamaha drums in the past prior to endorsing DW in 1988. With Chicago, Seraphine used Rogers and Slingerland drums; and in the 1970s, he used an array of Slingerland drum kits in both recording and touring and in a variety of configurations. He switched to Yamaha Drums around 1984 before the departure of singer and bassist Peter Cetera. In 1988, he switched to Drum Workshop, which he has been with ever since. He had previously used Pro-Mark drumsticks, but eventually switched to using Danny Seraphine signature drumsticks, a line created for him by Zildjian, and for many years, he used Remo heads.\n\n"}

They also live in the Tébessa area and other parts of eastern Algeria coextensive with ancient Numidia, as well as a few adjacent towns in Tunisia. They call themselves \"Išawiyen\"/\"Icawiyen\" (pronounced ) and speak the Shawiya language.\n\nHistorically, the Aurès Mountains served as a refuge for Berber peoples, forming a base of resistance against the Roman Empire, the Vandals, the Byzantine Empire and Arabs. Aurès was also a district of Algeria that existed during and after the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. It was in this region that Berber independence fighters started the war.\n\nThe patriarch of Berbers is believed to be \"Madghacen\", common ancestor of the Zenata and of the Botri as well. Ibn Khaldun identified the Zenata as Berbers. Modern historians rank this Berber region within the group of Numidians and Gaetuli or the much more ancient such as Meshwesh, Maesulians and Mazaxes, from whom formed the Zenata, the main inhabitants of the Aurès in the Middle Ages. Chaoui clans known by Ibn Khaldoun were the Ifren, Maghrawa, Djerawa, Abdalwadides, Howara and Awarba.\n\nAccording to de Slane, translator of the books of Ibn Khaldun, the term Chaoui/Shawi means \"shepherd\" and designates the Zenata Berbers.\n\nAfter the independence of Algeria, the Chaouis remained localized mainly in the Auresian region. They are the second Berber-speaking group in terms of number of speakers, the first being the Kabyle.\n\nThe Chaoui traditionally speak the Shawiya language (\"Berber:\" Tachawit). It belongs to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family, and is a variety of the Zenati languages.\n\nShawiya is a closely related cluster of dialects spoken in the Aurès region (\"Berber:\" Awras) of eastern Algeria and surrounding areas including Batna, Khenchela, south Sétif, Oum El Bouaghi, Souk Ahras, Tébessa, and the north part of Biskra.\n\nRecently the Shawiya language, together with the Kabyle language, has begun to achieve some cultural prominence due to the Berber cultural and political movements in Algeria.\n\nChaoui music is a specific style of Berber music. The Shawia dance is called Rahaba; men and women dancing at weddings. There are many 20th century singers, such as Aïssa Djermouni, Ali Khencheli, Massinissa, Ishem Boumaraf, Djamel Sabri, Houria Aïchi, etc.\n\nChaoui painters and sculptors (of whom there are many) include Cherif Merzouki, Abdelkhader Houamel, Hassane Amraoui, Adel Abdessemed, and Mohamed Demagh.\n\nThe fantasia is a traditional exhibition of horsemanship in the Aurès performed during cultural festivals.\n\nThe Chaoui were featured in Amor Hakkar's 2008 film \"La Maison jaune\".\n\n"}

He attended the High School in Edinburgh. He then studied law at the University of Glasgow from whence he went to Balliol College, Oxford. He graduated with a BA in 1834 and an MA in 1836.\n\nHe was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1835, and in 1852 he was made Solicitor General for Scotland in Lord Derby's first ministry, three months later becoming Lord Advocate, a post he held from May to December of that year. In the summer of 1857, he famously served as counsel for Madeleine Smith, a Glasgow socialite who was the defendant in a sensational murder trial. Smith was freed with a verdict of \"not proven\".\n\nIn March 1858 he resumed this office in Lord Derby's second administration, being returned to the House of Commons as member for Stamford. Again his tenure was brief, leaving office in July 1858. He was responsible for the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858, and in the same year he was elevated to the bench as Lord Justice Clerk, with the judicial title \"Lord Glencorse\".

This endonym is rendered as les \"Chleuh\" in French. The Ishelhien are also known as \"Shluh\" and \"Schlöh\". Among Arabic speakers, \"Chleuh\" serves as an appellation for Berbers generally, although \"Imazighen\" is the proper Berber self-name for Berbers as a whole.\n\nThe Shilha people should not be confused with Sous people, which are a Shilha community alongside Ihahan and other Shilha communities.\n\nThe Shilha people live mainly in Morocco's southern Atlantic coast, the High Atlas Mountains, the Anti Atlas mountains, and the Sous Valley. They are of Berber origin, which along with the Berber people, includes other ethnic subgroups such as the Tuareg, Rif, Kabyle, Shawia and Beraber. The Shilha people are a part of Morocco's Berber-speaking community, and the southernmost residing Berber population.\n\nIn antiquity, Berbers traded with the Phoenicians and Carthaginians in commercial entrepots and colonies along the northwestern littoral. They established the ancient kingdom of Mauretania, which fell under Roman rule in 33 CE, before eventually being reunited under Berber sovereignty. During the 7th century, the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Berber and Byzantine strongholds in the Northwest Africa, seizing Carthage in 698 AD. Although the Umayyads nominally controlled Morocco over the following years, their rule was tenuous due to Berber resistance. Shortly in 739 AD, Umayyad Arabs were defeated by the Berbers at the battle of Nobles and Bagdoura. Morocco remained under the rule of Berber kingdoms such as Barghawata and Midrar... etc. In 789 AD, with the approval of the locals, a former Umayyad courtier established the Idrisid dynasty that ruled in Fez. It lasted until 970 AD, as various petty states vied for control over the ensuing centuries. After 1053, Morocco was ruled by a succession of Muslim dynasties founded by Berber tribes. Among these were the Almoravid dynasty (1053-1147) who spread Islam in Morocco, the Almohad dynasty (1147-1275), and the Marinid dynasty (1213-1524). In 1668, a sharifan family from the east assumed control and established the incumbent Alawite dynasty.\n\nAlthough the Ishelhien gradually adopted Islam, they and other Berbers in the mountains have held on to their traditional language, culture and religious customs to varying degrees. A small minority of the Shilha people are Christians and Jewish.\n\nThe French and Spanish colonial empires partitioned Morocco in 1904, and the southern part of the territory was declared a French protectorate in 1912. Arabization remained an official state policy under both the colonial and succeeding post-independence governments. With the spread of the Berber Spring to Berber territory during the 1980s, the Berbers sought to reaffirm their Berber roots. This culminated with a proposal by Berber nationalists in 2013 to establish an autonomous Shilha state within a greater Moroccan federation.\n\nThe Ishelhien mainly live in Morocco's Atlas Mountains and Sous Valley. Traditionally, they are farmers who also keep herds. Some are semi-nomadic, growing crops during the season when water is available, and moving with their herds during the dry season.\n\nThe Ishelhien communities in the southwestern mountains of Morocco cooperated with each other in terms of providing reciprocal grazing rights as seasons changed, as well as during periods of war. These alliances were re-affirmed by annual festive gatherings, where one Shilha community would invite nearby and distant Shilha communities.\n\nThe Ishelhien speak the Shilha language, a Berber dialect. It belongs to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. Their language is sometimes referred to as \"Sous-Berber\".\n\nAs of 2014, there were around 5 million Shilha speakers, constituting 14.1% of the Moroccan population.\n\nThe Shilha language differs considerably from certain Berber varieties, such as those spoken by the Tuareg.\n\n\n\n"}

Decca would use the same cover (minus the lettering) for the band's second UK album, \"The Rolling Stones No. 2\", in early 1965.\n\nThe album was included in Robert Christgau's \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in \"\" (1981).\n\nIn August 2002, \"12 × 5\" was reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records. This edition includes stereo versions of \"Around and Around\", \"Confessin' the Blues\", \"Empty Heart\", \"It's All Over Now\", an extended version of \"2120 South Michigan Avenue\", and \"If You Need Me\".\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\"12 × 5\" proved to be a faster seller than \"England's Newest Hit Makers\", reaching No. 3 and going gold quickly.\n"}
{"id": "1950933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950933", "title": "The Long Ryders", "text": "The Long Ryders\n\nThe Long Ryders are an American alternative country and Paisley Underground band, principally active between 1982 and 1987, who have periodically regrouped for brief reunions (2004, 2009, 2014, 2016). In 2019 they released a new studio album – their first in 32 years – and announced a series of tour dates to follow.\n\nThe Long Ryders were originally formed by several American musicians who were each multi-instrumentalists and influenced by Gram Parsons, the Byrds, country music and various punk rock groups. They were named after the Walter Hill film, \"the Long Riders\". The band featured Sid Griffin and Stephen McCarthy on vocals and guitar; Des Brewer on bass (later replaced by Tom Stevens); and Greg Sowders on drums.\n\nAlthough two members were transplants from the American South, they became a popular Los Angeles rock band, forming in the early 1980s and originally associated with a movement called the Paisley Underground. With a sound reminiscent of \"Rubber Soul\"-era Beatles, electric Bob Dylan, Buffalo Springfield and the Flying Burrito Brothers, but with a harder edge, they anticipated the alternative country music of the 1990s by a decade. Their early work contained influences of both punk (largely attributable to devoted record collector Griffin) and old-school country (championed by McCarthy). Former Byrd Gene Clark joined them on their first full-length album, 1984's \"Native Sons\", adding vocals to the song \"Ivory Tower\". Their initial studio release, the \"10-5-60\" EP, consisted of Griffin, Brewer, McCarthy, and Sowders. Brewer left after the release of \"10-5-60\". He was replaced by Tom Stevens and that line-up remained in place as a recording unit until their eventual demise.\n\nThe Long Ryders' roots can be traced back to 1960s garage rock revivalist the Unclaimed, who formed in Los Angeles in 1979. After one EP, Kentucky-born guitarist and vocalist Sid Griffin and Kansas-born bassist Barry Shank left the Unclaimed in November 1981 with intentions to form a new band. Griffin: \"I had this idea of what would happen if the top of the band, the guitars and the vocals were very West Coast [1960s], punchy and beautiful, but the bass and drums were as aggressive as a punk band. Early rehearsals included Unclaimed drummer Matt Roberts and future Dream Syndicate guitarist Steve Wynn. Drummer Greg Sowders, a native of Los Angeles, had met Griffin through a mutual friend and joined the band in February 1982 after an informal audition. The band rehearsed shortly as a trio before guitarist and vocalist Stephen McCarthy completed the lineup after answering a musicians wanted ad in March. Originally from Virginia, McCarthy had recently moved to Los Angeles and was looking for something \"a bit rockier\" after playing in country and western bands in New York and Nashville. They soon settled on the name the Long Ryders, named after the Walter Hill film \"the Long Riders\". The band wrote a letter to actor Stacy Keach, who had starred in and produced the film, asking for his approval to use the name. Keach was \"honored\" but had suggested a different spelling for legal reasons. The band then decided on the \"y\" spelling as an homage to the Byrds.\n\nThe Long Ryders were initially linked with the neo-psychedelia of Los Angeles' Paisley Underground scene, but McCarthy's arrival soon brought a country element to the band. Griffin: \"His Clarence White-style country guitar-playing gave us a direction that nobody else had.\" Shank left the band in August 1982 to go back to college and was replaced by British expat Des Brewer. Later in the year, the new lineup entered producer Ethan James' Radio Tokyo Studio in Venice, California to record a three-track demo. Two of the tracks, \"Still Get By\" and \"And She Rides\", later appeared on the various artists compilation albums \"The Radio Tokyo Tapes\" and \"The Rebel Kind - A Collection of Contemporary Garage and Psychedelic Bands\" in 1983.\n\nIn September 1983, PVC Records issued the band's self-funded \"10-5-60\" EP, which was produced by former Sparks guitarist Earle Mankey at his home studio in California. Griffin was working for PVC's parent label Jem Records, an import and distribution label, who agreed to take on distribution. Griffin: \"I got us on the in-house label, and they did it as a favour. ... it did really well, and they couldn't believe it\". The EP showed a strong 1960s influence, from garage rock and psychedelia to Byrdsian folk and country rock. It was well received by critics, prompting the band to tour the US. Brewer, who was not committed to touring, left after the EP's release and was replaced by Don McCall, who only lasted 3 months before he was asked to leave. \"His playing and my drumming never quite clicked,\" Sowders explained. Tom Stevens from Indiana became the band's new bassist in January 1984, after recommendations from mutual friends. \"I didn’t even have to formally audition,\" Stevens said. \"The Long Ryders had gigs coming up in the San Francisco area and needed someone quickly.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1984, the Long Ryders signed with Los Angeles-based independent record label Frontier Records and recorded their first full length album, \"Native Sons\", at A&M Studios in Los Angeles in early summer. They chose veteran producer Henry Lewy (Joni Mitchell, the Flying Burrito Brothers) to co-produce the album. Musically, the band had toned down the psychedelia, emphasizing country and rock and roll. The album featured former Byrd Gene Clark adding vocals to the song \"Ivory Tower\". \"Gene was someone we all really admired,\" Sowders said. \"He was around in LA, and we all knew him.\" Released in October 1984, \"Native Sons\" became the number 4 album on the college radio and Indie charts in the US and received positive critical reviews. The band's take on American musical traditions was especially a success with critics in the UK, where the \"Melody Maker\" called it \"a modern American classic\". Upon release in the UK in March 1985, it was distributed by Zippo Records, who also released \"I Had a Dream\" as a UK-only single. The album and the single reached number 1 and 4 on the UK Indie Chart, respectively. \nFollowing the success of \"Native Sons\", the Long Ryders decided to reissue the \"10-5-60\" EP as a full-length album, retitled \"5 by 5\" with five new studio tracks. The band entered A&M Studios in February 1985 with engineer and co-producer Paul McKenna and recorded at least six tracks: \"Time Keeps Travelling\", \"The Trip\", \"Sandwich Man\", \"As God Is My Witness\", the Flamin' Groovies' \"I Can’t Hide\", and Bob Dylan's \"Masters of War\". The planned album, however, was abandoned when the band would sign a new record deal and prepare to record their next proper album later in the year. Most of the tracks were later included as bonus tracks on future compilation albums and on reissues of \"Native Sons\" and \"10-5-60\". \"I Can’t Hide\" was released as a flexi disc in 1986 under the moniker the Spinning Wighats and given away free with \"the Bob\" magazine.\n\nAfter touring the US for much of 1984, the Long Ryders embarked on their first international tour to Europe in March and April 1985. \"Upon our arrival in the UK,\" Stevens said, \"we were greeted with sold out shows, amazing crowd receptions, the cover of \"NME\", and literally twelve record companies at our London hotel door after our second London show.\" Island Records UK signed the band in late spring and the band returned to the US to write and demo new songs. Released in September 1985, their first major label album, \"State of Our Union\", was recorded in England at Chipping Norton Studios and produced by Will Birch, formerly of British bands the Kursaal Flyers and the Records. The album was a success at college and alternative radio stations in the US, but its more prominent rock sound didn't please UK critics as much as \"Native Sons\". \"State of Our Union\" reached number 66 on the UK Albums Chart as well as number 2 on the UK Country Chart. The single \"Looking for Lewis and Clark\" peaked at number 59 on the UK Singles Chart but was never released commercially in the US. The album sold well in the UK, where \"Looking for Lewis and Clark\" gained the band much wider exposure. \"State of Our Union\" quickly became the band's biggest selling album, and the band was soon more popular in Europe than in the US, where they failed to break out of the college radio market.\n\nIn spring 1986, the Long Ryders were widely criticized for doing a TV commercial in the US for Miller Beer. Fans, critics and certain areas of the music community were outraged and accused the band of selling out. \"The Long Ryders doing the Miller Beer ad killed us in the USA. It killed us stone dead. We went from hot to cold in about three weeks,\" Griffin said. \"The Blasters, Los Lobos and X all did beer commercials too, but only us and the Del Fuegos got ripped for it.\" The band was not getting much airplay on regular commercial radio stations in the US and hoped that a beer commercial would provide them a much-needed exposure. Also, the band was not making any money touring. \"To this day the only money the Long Ryders has ever seen is from that beer commercial,\" Griffin said in 2016. The band, however, continued to tour, building on their success in Europe. In Spain, they headlined in front of 100,000 people at a Barcelona festival in September 1986 which was broadcast live on national radio. Griffin: \"Probably the highest of the high points. Graham Parker and the Shot, Wilson Pickett – they were both opening for us that day. I nearly fainted.\"\n\nThe Long Ryders had ended 1986 by recording their second Island album, \"Two-Fisted Tales\", in November and December at A&M and Eldorado Studios in Hollywood with producer Ed Stasium (the Ramones, Soul Asylum, the Smithereens, Living Colour). It was mixed in February 1987 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas and features guest appearances by David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and Debbi and Vicki Peterson of the Bangles. On the album, the Long Ryders moved further away from their country rock origins towards a more college rock direction, but were still rooted in traditional Americana music. The finished album was delivered to Island in March, but the release was delayed for two months. \"Tom Waits was selling better than Island expected, U2 were still shifting units, and so we were told to wait\", Griffin said. In the two years since the Long Ryders signed with Island, several key employees had left the label's A&R department, and the new team showed little interest in the band and the release of \"Two-Fisted Tales\". In the meantime, the band were offered to open for U2 on the North American leg of their Joshua Tree tour in April and May. But since \"Two-Fisted Tales\" was delayed, the Long Ryders declined, hoping to join the U2 tour later on. Griffin: \"We never did get to open for U2 at all, not even once. So this was a major opportunity blown, no question about it, and a fairly big regret of mine.\"\n\nThe album was finally released in June and despite its first single, a cover of NRBQ’s \"I Want You Bad\", getting radio airplay, neither single nor album charted. The lack of commercial success and label support as well as a relentless touring schedule began to take its toll on the band. After a European tour, Stevens left the band to be replaced by the band's guitar tech, Larry Chatman, for a US tour that followed immediately. Griffin: \"He went on the road with us and learned while driving across the country and in motel rooms at night. We never had a formal rehearsal.\" In 2013, Stevens explained his reasons for leaving: \"The spring 1987 tour of Europe was a nightmare. Despite a major label \"deal,\" we were broke, and I found myself having to find another source of income so that my growing family could eat and have a roof over their heads. In June 1987, when the other Long Ryders insisted upon doing a U.S. tour that was expected to lose five figures, I announced that I was leaving the band.\"\n\nIn August, McCarthy announced to the band that he would be leaving at the end of the US tour. \"It was a dead end,\" he said in 1988. \"I don’t regret a day I played in the Long Ryders, but it was futile. I quit before it got to the point of beating each other on stage.\" Even though Island offered Griffin and Sowders the opportunity to record a third album for the label, they decided not to continue as the Long Ryders without McCarthy. The band did not officially break up until late 1987.\n\n\"Our signing with Island in 1985 worked well for the first few months,\" Stevens said in 2009. \"Then our A&R guy got the axe at year's end [and] the new UK regime hated us. Island U.S. was also fairly useless. ... we never seemed to be a big concern for any of them. Between that and the slow shift that started in 1986 to hair metal, the terrain got so creepy and hard to navigate that it put a strain on us as a band, from which we could not recover.\"\n\nIn 1989, the Long Ryders fan club released the authorized C90 audio cassette compilation \"Metallic B.O.\", which contained previously unreleased live recordings and studio outtakes. The tape was subsequently edited down for CD reissue by Overground Records in 1990. Two live albums and two compilation albums were released in the 1990s and 2000s. \"BBC Radio One Live in Concert\" (1994) and \"\" (2003) contain live recordings from 1985 and 1987, while \"\" (1998) and \"The Best of the Long Ryders\" (2004) collect tracks spanning the band's career from 1983 to 1987, including B-sides, demos and live recordings.\n\nGriffin, who relocated to London, kept busy as a solo artist and bandleader (the Coal Porters, Western Electric), and as a music journalist and author. Since 1994, he has run his own label, the London-based Prima Records. The label is primarily, but not exclusively, an outlet for Griffin's solo projects, and releases by the Long Ryders and the Coal Porters. He wrote several books, including \"Gram Parsons: A Music Biography\" (1985), \"Million Dollar Bash: Bob Dylan, The Band & the Basement Tapes\" (2007) and \"Shelter from the Storm: Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Years\" (2010). The second volume was reissued in 2014 to coincide with the release of \"\", a six-CD collection to which Griffin contributed liner notes.\n\nMcCarthy, after a stint leading his own band, Walker Stories, and appearing on the 1990 multi-artist album \"True Voices\" in a duet with Carla Olson on the Tom Jans song \"Loving Arms,\" returned home to Richmond, Virginia; he played in the indie supergroup Gutterball with Steve Wynn and fellow Richmondites Bryan Harvey and Johnny Hott of House of Freaks, and in 2001 began playing with the Jayhawks. Stevens returned to his native Indiana, earned a degree in computer science and released solo albums. Additionally, Sowders, who was briefly married to singer Lucinda Williams, went to work in music publishing. Brewer continued to play the Los Angeles circuit, first accompanying various female singer-songwriters, and then moving on to the old-school country band, the Misbegotten Cowboys. Original bassist Shank holds a Ph.D. in American studies and is a professor at Ohio State University. He is the author of several books, including \"Dissonant Identities: The Rock 'n' Roll Scene in Austin, Texas\" (1994), \"A Token of My Affection: Greeting Cards and American Business Culture\" (2004), and \"The Political Force of Musical Beauty\" (2014).\n\nIn 2003, a European booking agent approached the band about putting together a Long Ryders reunion for shows in the UK, Spain and the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, including a performance at the Glastonbury Festival. \"I never thought the Long Ryders would play together again.\", Griffin said in 2004. \"I'd had offers before to tour as 'Sid Griffin and the Long Ryders', a kind of karaoke version of the Long Ryders playing Long Ryders songs ... But this offer was to get all the originals together, so I passed it along. ... I thought if we don’t do it now we [are] never going to do it.\" A live album entitled \"State of Our Reunion\" resulted from the reunion tour. The band played their first live dates in the US in more than 20 years when they played two shows at the EARL in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2009. \"Just some crazy guy with money,\" Griffin said. In January 2014, the Long Ryders played their first show in Los Angeles in 27 years at the one-off Earle Mankey Appreciation Night concert at the Troubadour. A five date Spanish tour followed in December.\n\nIn January 2016, Cherry Red Records released a Long Ryders box set, \"Final Wild Songs\", composed of all the material from their three full-length albums, their one EP, various demos and rarities, and a previously unavailable 15-song performance from a Benelux radio appearance in March 1985. \"Mojo\" magazine, in its February 2016 issue, gave the collection a lead review, saying, \"They unwittingly invented Americana, but seldom receive credit for it. This 4-CD box set puts the record straight.\" The band subsequently played 12 dates on the Continent and in the UK in April and May, and 4 East Coast dates in the US in November.\n\nIn 2017, Griffin, McCarthy, Sowders and Stevens recorded the first new material for the Long Ryders since 1987. McCarthy: \"The band played a number of shows in 2016 and we felt it would be worthwhile to try and write/record some new material.\" McCarthy and Sowders recorded their parts for a few new songs with engineer and co-producer Adrian Olsen at his Montrose Recording studio in Virginia, while Griffin and Stevens recorded remotely from London and Indiana. A single from these recordings, \"Bear in the Woods,\" was released on April 17, 2017 in time for a 4 date Californian tour in late April.\n\nIn November 2018, Cherry Red Records released three-CD box set editions of the band's albums \"State of Our Union\" and \"Two-Fisted Tales\", also announcing that a new album from the band would be released in 2019 on Cherry Red Records in the UK and Omnivore Recordings in North America.\n\nOn February 15, 2019 the Long Ryders released \"Psychedelic Country Soul\", the band's first album of new material in 32 years. The opening track, \"Greenville\", premiered on the \"Billboard\" website. The album was produced by Ed Stasium at Dr. Dre's Record One studio in Los Angeles and features members of the Bangles on harmony vocals and Dave Pearlman (Dan Fogelberg, Phil Everly, Hoyt Axton) on pedal steel guitar. The \"LA Times\" said of the album, \"The record sounds fantastic\", whilst \"Mojo\" wrote, \"\"Psychedelic Country Soul\" puts them right back at the top of a world they helped create.\" The Long Ryders announced a series of tour dates in 2019 to support the album's release. It was the band's most extensive tour since the 1980s with 43 dates in Europe and North America. Sowders, who was unavailable for the October/November dates in Europe, was temporarily replaced by Simon Hancock. Between January 29 and February 3, 2020, the band participated in the Outlaw Country Cruise music festival, a 5-night boat cruise from Miami, Florida to Falmouth, Jamaica with over 30 artists including Lucinda Williams, the Mavericks and Steve Earle and the Dukes.\n\nMcCarthy contributed to Carla Olson's 2020 album, \"Have Harmony, Will Travel 2\", where he plays guitar and duets with Olson on \"Timber, I'm Falling In Love\", originally a No. 1 hit for Patty Loveless on Billboard's Hot Country Singles and Tracks chart in 1989. He also appears on Olson's \"Americana Railroad\" album in the autumn of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A pair of sawhorses can support a plank, forming a scaffold. In certain circles, it is also known as a \"mule\" and a short sawhorse is known as a pony. A sawhorse may also be a rack for supporting logs for sawing, known in the US as a sawbuck.\n\nThe sawhorse may be designed to fold for storage. A sawhorse with a wide top is particularly useful to support a board for sawing or as a field workbench, and is more useful as a single, but also more difficult to store.\n\nA sawhorse can also be used as the base for a portable work table by placing a sheet of plywood or even a door on top of two sawhorses. If the sawhorses are strong enough, the portable table can be used as a platform for tools like a table saw, although with caution if the top is not secured to the sawhorses.\n\nIn boatmaking, the curved nature of the cross-beam, designed to support the timbers used for hulls led to the colloquial name of sea-horse, this term, derived from old Norse, entered the Northumbrian dialect, it is thought, through Norwegian settlers as early as the 14th century.\n\nModern sawhorses are usually made of dimensional lumber, but the basic form of the sawhorse has remained unchanged for centuries. For example, one of the illustrations in De Re Metallica (1556) contains a drawing of a millwright using a pair of sawhorses to support the beams he is forming. The top of each of these sawhorses appears to be made from a halved log, with legs mortised or dovetailed into place.\n\nA device for crowd control in the 20th century had the shape of a sawhorse made of wood. The legs are similar but rather heavy duty facsimiles of the hobby version of about the same height. The horizontal bar consists of a heavy-duty plank about long with printed on it in large letters: \"Police Line - Do Not Cross\". Many cities have chosen to replace this wooden barrier with the French barrier, which is a metal crowd control device.\n\n"}

From south to north, the strait includes Smith Sound, Kane Basin, Kennedy Channel, Hall Basin and Robeson Channel. During 1962–64, a by ice island drifted southward from the Lincoln Sea through the Nares and Davis Straits to the Atlantic Ocean (Labrador Sea). Nares strait has a nearly permanent current from the north, powered by the Beaufort Gyre, making it harder to traverse for ships coming from the south.\n\nIn 1964, its name was agreed by the Danish (\"Stednavneudvalget\", now \"Stednavnenævnet\") and Canadian governments. The name derives from the British naval officer George Strong Nares.\n\nThe strait and neighbouring waters are usually hazardous for navigation and shipping. During August, however, it is usually navigable by icebreakers. Prior to 1948, only five vessels were recorded as having successfully navigated north of Kane Basin. In 2009 the ship \"Arctic Sunrise\" made the first known June transit into the Arctic Ocean.\n\nHans Island, a tiny island lying within the strait, is claimed by both Denmark (on behalf of Greenland) and Canada.

{"id": "1950950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950950", "title": "TrueOS", "text": "TrueOS\n\nTrueOS (formerly PC-BSD or PCBSD) was a Unix-like, server-oriented operating system built upon the most recent releases of FreeBSD-CURRENT. \n\nUp to 2018 it aimed to be easy to install by using a graphical installation program, and easy and ready-to-use immediately by providing KDE SC, Lumina, LXDE, MATE, or Xfce as the desktop environment. In June 2018 the developers announced that since TrueOS had become the core OS to provide a basis for other projects, the graphical installer had been removed. Graphical end-user-orientated OSes based on TrueOS are GhostBSD and Trident. TrueOS provided official binary Nvidia and Intel drivers for hardware acceleration and an optional 3D desktop interface through KWin, and Wine is ready-to-use for running Microsoft Windows software. TrueOS was also able to run Linux software, in addition to FreeBSD Ports collection, and it had its own .txz package manager. TrueOS supported OpenZFS, and the installer offered disk encryption with geli.\n\nDevelopment of TrueOS ended in 2020.\n\nTrueOS was founded by FreeBSD professional Kris Moore in early 2005 as PC-BSD. In August 2006 it was voted the most beginner-friendly operating system by OSWeekly.com.\n\nThe first beta of the PC-BSD consisted of only a GUI installer to get the user up and running with a FreeBSD 6 system with KDE3 pre-configured. This was a major innovation for the time as anyone wishing to install FreeBSD would have to manually tweak and run through a text installer. Kris Moore's goal was to make FreeBSD easy for everyone to use on the desktop and has since diverged even more in the direction of usability by including additional GUI administration tools and .pbi application installers. PC-BSD's application installer management involved a different approach to installing software than many other Unix-like operating systems, up to and including version 8.2, by means of the pbiDIR website. Instead of using the FreeBSD Ports tree directly (although it remained available), PC-BSD used files with the \".pbi\" filename extension (Push Button Installer) which, when double-clicked, brought up an installation wizard program. An autobuild system tracked the FreeBSD ports collection and generated new .pbi files daily. All software packages and dependencies were installed from inside of the .pbi files in their own self-contained directories in \"/Programs\". This convention was aimed to decrease confusion about where binary programs reside, and to remove the possibility of a package breaking if system libraries are upgraded or changed, and to prevent dependency hell.\n\nOn October 10, 2006, PC-BSD was acquired by enterprise hardware provider iXsystems. iXsystems now employs Kris Moore as a full-time developer and leader of the project. In November 2007, iXsystems entered into a distribution agreement with Fry's Electronics whereby Fry's Electronics stores nationwide carry boxed copies of PC-BSD version 1.4 (Da Vinci Edition). In January 2008, iXsystems entered into a similar agreement with Micro Center.\n\nOn September 1, 2016, the PC-BSD team announced that the name of the operating system will change to TrueOS. Along with the rebranding, the project also became a rolling release distribution, based on the FreeBSD-CURRENT branch.\n\nOn November 15, 2016, TrueOS began the transition from FreeBSD's rc.d to OpenRC as the default init system. Apart from Gentoo/Alt, where OpenRC was initially developed, this is the only other major BSD based operating system using OpenRC.\n\nIn July 2018, TrueOS announced that they would spin off the desktop edition into a separate project named \"Project Trident\".\n\nDevelopment of TrueOS was ended in 2020 and the developers recommended users move to other BSD-based operating systems.\n\nSince version 7, PC-BSD began following the same numbering system as FreeBSD.\n\nSince version 9.0, the KDE SC, customized to support tighter application integration and the .txz package management system, was no longer the only desktop environment supported by PC-BSD. While manual installation of other desktops such as Xfce and GNOME had been technically possible in earlier releases, none of these were supported in the earlier versions, and major functionality was lost when not using PC-BSD's special build of KDE SC. Starting with version 9.0, PC-BSD added other desktop environments, including GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, and MATE.\n\nPC-BSD used to support both amd64 and i686 architectures. Support for i686 was dropped in version 9.2.\n\nStarting in September 2016 with the rebranding of PC-BSD, TrueOS became a rolling release distribution based on FreeBSD's current branch.\n\nTrueOS's package manager takes a similar approach to installing software to many other Unix-like operating systems. Instead of using the FreeBSD Ports tree directly (although it remains available), TrueOS uses files with the \".txz\" filename extension packages which contain compiled ports. An autobuild system tracks the FreeBSD ports collection and generates new .txz files daily.\n\nThe TrueOS package management system aims to be visually similar to that of major operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS, where applications are installed from a single download link with graphical prompts, while maintaining internally the traditional .txz package management systems that many Unix-like systems use. The TrueOS package manager also takes care of creating categorized links in the KDE menu and on the KDE SC desktop.\n\nIn 2014, the PC-BSD project announced its development of a new desktop environment, from scratch, named Lumina. Ken Moore is the main developer of Lumina, which is based on the Qt toolkit.\n\nAs of July 2016, Lumina has its own web site.\n\nThe desktop environment is not an application development toolkit, and aims to be a graphical interface that only uses plugins for customization.\n\nTrueOS was originally licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) because the developers were under the impression that applications using the Qt, which TrueOS uses for its interface development, must be licensed under the GPL or the Q Public License. Upon discovering that there was, in fact, no such restriction, the TrueOS developers later relicensed the code under a BSD-like 3-clause license.\n\n\"TrueOS\" and the TrueOS logo are registered trademarks of iXsystems Inc.\n\nThe New York City *BSD User Group runs a service named dmesgd, which provides user-submitted dmesg information for different computer hardware (laptops, workstations, single-board computers, embedded systems, virtual machines, etc.) capable of running TrueOS.\n\nAccording to the TrueOS wiki, TrueOS has the following hardware requirements:\n\n\n\nUEFI support (for amd64 only) has been added to the installer and the boot manager since version 10.1 with the default EFI boot manager to be rEFInd. This includes ACPI detection and setup of Root System Description Pointer (RSDP), eXtended System Descriptor Table (XSDT), and Root System Description Table (RSDT) pass-through values to the kernel. A new installation is needed in order to install UEFI support as it requires the creation of a small FAT partition. The current UEFI does not support secure boot.\n\n\n\n"}

Crowbars are commonly used to open nailed wooden crates or pry apart boards. In mining, crowbars have been used to break and remove rock, but not as much in modern mining.\n\nThe design can be used as any of the three lever classes. The curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second-class lever. \n\nDesigns made from thick flat steel bar are often referred to as utility bars.\n\nNormally made of medium-carbon steel, crowbars can alternatively be made from titanium, which has the advantage of being lighter.\n\nCommonly crowbars are forged from long steel products, either hexagonal or sometimes cylindrical stock. Alternative designs may be forged with a rounded I-shaped cross-section shaft. Versions using relatively wide flat steel bar are often referred to as \"Utility bar\"s.\n\nThe accepted etymology identifies the first component of the word \"crowbar\" with the bird-name \"crow\", perhaps due to the crowbar's resemblance to the feet or beak of a crow. The first attestation of the word is dated back to circa 1400. They also were called simply \"crows\", or \"iron crows\"; William Shakespeare used the term \"iron crow\" in many places, including his play \"Romeo and Juliet\", Act 5, Scene 2: \"Get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell.\"\n\nIn Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel \"Robinson Crusoe\", the protagonist uses crowbars as pickaxes but refers to these tools as iron crows: \"As for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy.\"\n\nIn Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, due to the influence of American media \"crowbar\" may occasionally be used loosely for this tool, but it is still mainly used to mean a larger straighter tool, its original English meaning (see digging bar). The term \"jammy\" or \"jimmy\" most often refers to the tool when used for burglary.\n\n"}
{"id": "1950960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950960", "title": "Crowbar (circuit)", "text": "Crowbar (circuit)\n\nA crowbar circuit is an electrical circuit used for preventing an overvoltage condition of a power supply unit from damaging the circuits attached to the power supply. It operates by putting a short circuit or low resistance path across the voltage output (V), quite like were one to drop a crowbar across the output terminals of the power supply. Crowbar circuits are frequently implemented using a thyristor, TRIAC, trisil or thyratron as the shorting device. Once triggered, they depend on the current-limiting circuitry of the power supply or, if that fails, the blowing of the line fuse or tripping the circuit breaker.\n\nAn example crowbar circuit is shown to the right. This particular circuit uses an LM431 adjustable zener regulator to control the gate of the TRIAC. The resistor divider of R and R provide the reference voltage for the LM431. The divider is set so that during normal operating conditions, the voltage across R is slightly lower than V of the LM431. Since this voltage is below the minimum reference voltage of the LM431, it remains off and very little current is conducted through the LM431. If the cathode resistor is sized accordingly, very little voltage will be dropped across it and the TRIAC gate terminal will be essentially at the same potential as MT1, keeping the TRIAC off. If the supply voltage increases, the voltage across R will exceed V and the LM431 cathode will begin to draw current. The voltage at the gate terminal will be pulled down, exceeding the gate trigger voltage of the TRIAC and latching it on.\n\nA crowbar circuit is distinct from a clamp in pulling, once triggered, the voltage below the trigger level, usually close to ground. A clamp prevents the voltage from exceeding a preset level. Thus, a crowbar will not automatically return to normal operation when the overvoltage condition is removed; power must be removed entirely to stop its conduction.\n\nAn active crowbar is a crowbar that can remove the short circuit when the transient is over thus allowing the device to resume normal operation. Active crowbars use a transistor, gate turn off (GTO) thyristor or forced commutated thyristor instead of a thyristor to short the circuit. Active crowbars are commonly used to protect the frequency converter in the rotor circuit of doubly fed generators against high voltage and current transients caused by the voltage dips in the power network. Thus the generator can ride through the fault and quickly continue the operation even during the voltage dip.\n\nThe advantage of a crowbar over a clamp is that the low holding voltage of the crowbar lets it carry higher fault current without dissipating much power (which could otherwise cause overheating). Also, a crowbar is more likely than a clamp to deactivate a device (by blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker), bringing attention to the faulty equipment.\n\nThe term is also used as a verb to describe the act of short-circuiting the output of a power supply, or the malfunction of a CMOS circuit -- the PMOS half of a pair lingering in a near on-state when only its corresponding NMOS is supposed to be on (or the NMOS when the PMOS is supposed to be on) -- resulting in a near short-circuit current between supply rails.\n\nHigh voltage crowbars are used for HV tube (Klystron and IOT) protection.\n\nMany bench top power supplies have a crowbar circuit to protect the connected equipment.\n\nMicrowave ovens often use a microswitch that acts as a crowbar circuit in the door latch assembly. This will absolutely prevent the magnetron from being energized with the door open. Activation will blow the main fuse and ruin the microswitch. \n\n\n"}

It is common and widespread in a range stretching from Texas and Florida north to Minnesota, Ontario and Massachusetts. It is currently on the United Plant Savers \"At Risk\" list. UpS is an organization concerned with the preservation of endangered medicinal plants on the territory of North America.\n\n\"Dioscorea villosa\" is, according to the Flora of North America, quite variable in shape across its range. It ranges from a small vine with winged stems, tightly packed groups of flowers, variably hairy leaves all the way up to large vines with unwinged stems, large, smooth leaves, and widely spread sprays of flowers. It always has rhizomes spreading underground that can be branched or not. \n\n\"Dioscorea villosa\" contains diosgenin, which despite claims is not a phytoestrogen and does not interact with estrogen receptors. Other steroidal saponins are also found in the plant.\n\nSome of the English common names of this plant reflect its use in Native American and other traditional medicines. In traditional Russian herbal medicine, saponin extracts from the roots of various varieties of wild yam are thought to be an anticoagulant, antisclerotic, antispasmodic, cholagogue, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic and a vasodilator.\n\nThere is little modern clinical research on \"Dioscorea villosa\", and the one study of a wild yam-containing cream for menopausal symptoms failed to find any value from this therapy.

As a performer, he has been in studio sessions and on tour with some of the most notable and highest-selling musicians of all time. He was the drummer for the multi-platinum band Chicago from 1990 to 2018. He is a multi-platinum selling artist. As an educator, he has been a drum clinician and author of tutorial materials.\n\nSome of Imboden's most notable work include recordings with Neil Diamond, Kenny Loggins, Firefall, Richard Marx, Steve Vai, Roger Daltrey, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Chicago, Anita Baker, Julio Iglesias and Stevie Wonder.\n\nIn addition he has toured the world with rock and jazz acts such as Kenny Loggins, Al Jarreau, Chaka Khan, Firefall, Cock Robin, Michael McDonald, Chicago, and other notable groups.\n\nAs a full-time band member, Imboden's career has included Honk, the Kenny Loggins Band (including \"Who's Right, Who's Wrong\" featuring Michael Jackson, the six-time platinum Number One hit \"Footloose\", and \"I'm Alright\" from Caddyshack), and Chicago. His career with Chicago has seen the release of thirteen albums, several of them certified as platinum.\n\nAside from a brief, early, move to Germany, Tris Imboden was raised in various beachside communities of Orange County in Southern California. As a primarily self-taught, lifetime career musician, his musical interests were stirred by seeing a parade when he was five years old.\n\nHis formal training began from grade school; and until there was an available position in the percussion section of the school band, he drummed at home on a practice pad and studied basic music theory on the trumpet at school. He ultimately reached the position of second chair trumpeter before switching to the then-available percussion section in junior high school. He currently resides in Malibu, California and on the island of Kauai, Hawai'i, where he is an avid surfer.\n\nImboden began his adolescent career in various surf bands, and then achieved professional status in a high school band called The Other Half. The band performed at venues ranging from sock hops to Hollywood's venerable Teenage Fair, where Imboden said their popularity \"clogged the whole entrance\". Out of Newport Harbor High School, Imboden cofounded Honk in 1970. After recording some demo songs, the band's first album was the soundtrack for the surf movie \"Five Summer Stories\", crediting Imboden as composer, producer, drummer, harmonica player, and vocalist. Imboden established a career trend, ultimately lasting through to Chicago, of occasionally being featured on harmonica. The song \"Pipeline Sequence\" reached No. 1 on Hawai'i radio. Being a member of Honk provided Imboden with formative future career experience as the band built their studio recording skills, their touring skills, and innumerable industry contacts. They worked with bands which would eventually serve as Imboden's future professional base, by touring with Loggins and Messina, Jackson Browne, and The Beach Boys—and by opening Chicago's concerts. Honk went on hiatus from 1976 to 1986, when they established a tradition of periodic reunion concerts in their original home area of Southern California, as band members' schedules permit.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1986, Imboden became a full-time recording and touring member of the Kenny Loggins Band, and then would do part-time work with them until 1989, for a total of 12 years of collaboration. During his full-time tenure there, he composed and performed the drum set arrangements for popular 1980s motion picture soundtracks: \"Caddyshack\" and \"Footloose\".\n\nFrom the end of his full-time duration with Kenny Loggins in 1986, until 1989, Imboden's career became a full-time composite of various part-time session recordings and live performances with various groups. His consistent work throughout that entire duration included the following: part-time work with Kenny Loggins; stage support for Grammy Award winning jazz singer, Al Jarreau; and \"Queen of Funk-Soul\", Chaka Khan. In 1986, he performed drum set overdub sessions for Neil Diamond's \"Headed for the Future\" album. This album provided a venue for Imboden's studio session collaboration with a then-member of Chicago, Bill Champlin. In 1988, he was a studio session player with former member of Chicago, bassist/lead vocalist, Peter Cetera, on Cetera's solo album titled \"One More Story\".\n\nIn 1990, his career reshaped by joining the multi-platinum Chicago. With the departure of founding drummer Danny Seraphine, Imboden joined the band as the full-time drummer in time for the band's 1991 release titled \"Twenty 1\". As an integral part of Chicago for the latter half of the band's -year total career, Imboden would contribute to twelve Chicago records, and to tours alongside The Beach Boys, Earth, Wind, & Fire, and The Doobie Brothers. Since 2012, his drum set was accompanied by Chicago's newest full-time member, veteran auxiliary percussionist Walfredo Reyes, Jr. On January 17, 2018, Imboden announced his resignation from the band to focus on family time with his new wife and due to the band's schedule of touring intensely for the most of each year.\n\nTris Imboden currently endorses and uses the following products:\n\n\n\n"}

The company claims to be one of the largest producers of chicken and turkey products in Australia and employs in excess of 8,000 people in more than 100 locations in Australia and New Zealand. The company was founded in 1918 and was managed by members of the Ingham family from its establishment until 2014, including Walter Ingham and his two sons, Jack Ingham and Bob Ingham. TPG Capital acquired Inghams in 2014 for A$880 million. Inghams was listed on the ASX in November 2016.\n\nIngham Enterprises, often called Inghams, produce a range of foods for human and animal consumption that can generally be classified into poultry and non-poultry products.\n\nInghams products are available in most Australian and New Zealand supermarkets. The company is also a large supplier to the hospitality and food service industry and schools with a range of chicken and turkey products, and egg-free products.\n\nA range of chicken product lines are produced including fresh chicken cuts, such as chicken thighs, chicken breasts and chicken mince, amongst other fresh chicken lines. Products that are ready-to-cook include chicken kebabs, schnitzels, and a range of roasting portions that are typically available from most supermarket delis. Inghams also produce packaged chicken products for most supermarkets that are pre-packaged including drumsticks, thighs, breast filets, wings and mince. Ready-to-cook packaged products include the above items as well as chicken burger patties, chicken meatballs, and limited meal options. Items available from the supermarket freezer section include roasting chickens and a ready-to-cook Chicken Kiev. Processed chicken meat, into a roll, is also produced as a ready-to-eat line and available as a deli item.\n\nTurkey product lines include fresh turkey meats in a range of cuts such as sausages, small roasts, steaks, wings, drumsticks, schnitzel and turkey mince. Ready-to-eat lines are either roasted or smoked and packaged. Frozen items include a whole turkey, buffé, or Kiev.\n\nInghams claims to be the largest manufacturer of stockfeed in Australasia; with product lines for horses, pigs, and poultry. The equine division provides unique products for the racing, breeding and leisure/performance horse industries. Some equine products lines are exported to Asia, the Middle East, UK, and South Africa.\n\nThe company was founded in 1918 when Walter Ingham Sr. purchased of bush land in Casula as a gift to 18-year-old son, Walter Ingham. Walter Jr. embarked on a fruit and vegetable farming venture, eventually moving into the poultry business. Starting with just one cockerel and six hens, his flock quickly grew to 1,000 birds. On his death in 1953, his two sons, Jack and Bob Ingham took over the small breeding operation and built it into the largest producer of chickens and turkeys in Australia.\n\nIn the 1920s, as with most farmers during this time, Walter Ingham was self-sufficient and produced feed for his own poultry and horses. Most work was pre-mechanised, so back-breaking work included ploughing the fields. Due to a lack of meat during World War II, Inghams provided Australians with poultry products. Women contributed to the war effort by working on farms owned by the Ingham family.\n\nIn 1958, the company built first processing plant at Casula. By the early to mid-1960s, new styles and techniques of packaging and processing led to the company's involvement in the rapid process of expansion and development of the poultry industry. Ingham became a household name throughout Australia. In 1963, Inghams had acquired 50% of A.A. Tegel turkey, and took the company over completely in 1994. In 1968 the first KFC restaurant opened in Sydney. In 1976, KFC and Inghams aligned in a business partnership, providing new opportunities for both companies.\n\nAcquisitions included Chickadee Food Pty Ltd (26 per cent in 1972); Harvey Farms in 1990, the number two chicken processor in New Zealand.\n\nBy the mid-1980s there was a dramatic shift to food processing creating a revolution for the poultry industry. The McDonald's chicken nugget product, developed by Tyson in the United States, was launched in Australia. By 1995, due to enormous popularity, Inghams built a dedicated plant strictly to produce McDonald's nuggets.\n\nIn 2001, Inghams established Murarrie poultry processing plant, the largest in the country with the most sophisticated machinery, production and supply chain technologies employing approximately 1,200 workers.\n\nIn 2008, the company officially cancelled their 'halal certification' status in Western Australia and is no longer supplying halal slaughtered chicken.\n\nIn May 2015, Ingams agreed to pay $80,000 to the Lake Macquarie Council, after a ruptured tank resulted in 1,700 litres of chicken blood and offal to flow into local waterways the previous year.\n\nIn 2019, Ingham chicken heir Robby Ingham sold his South Coast oceanfront property Ocean Pines for the highest auction result recorded on the NSW South Coast of $11.3 million through real estate agent Craig Pontey.\n\nThe Ingham name is also synonymous with horses. The Inghams passion for horseracing began during the days they'd spend with Walter Ingham at the race tracks. Along with the poultry business, the Jack and Bob Ingham also inherited \"Valiant Rose\", which was a descendent broodmare of a champion British racehorse. In the 1960s, they began building their thoroughbred horse racing and breeding operations. This passion became the largest thoroughbred dynasty in Australia until Bob sold the entire operation in 2008.\n\nKey events during these years included Bob Ingham purchasing his first two trotters in 1965. By 1970, Bob and Jack were the biggest trotting owners in Australia; and had 650 race wins by 31 July 1974.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Ingham's most widely known thoroughbred horse, \"Octagonal\", became a household name with 28 starts, 24 wins, 7 seconds and 1 third placement resulting in nearly A$6 million in earnings. In 1995–1996, it was voted Australian Champion Three Year Old and Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year.\n\nDuring 2004 and 2005, \"Lonhro\", son of \"Octagonal\", had 35 starts with 26 wins, 3 seconds and 2 thirds, earning nearly the same amount as his father.\n\nIn 2008, divesting themselves of the equine interests, Dubai's Sheikh bought Inghams' thoroughbred horse breeding business, incorporating it into the Darley Stud.\n\n"}

He was also minister of interior from 1975 to 2012.\n\nNayef bin Abdulaziz, sometimes Naif bin Abdulaziz, was born in Ta'if in 1934 to Ibn Saud (King Abdulaziz) and Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, making him one of the Sudairi Seven. He was the twenty-third son of King Abdulaziz.\n\nPrince Nayef received education at Princes' School and from senior ulema (Muslim legal scholars). Additionally, he was educated in diplomacy and security affairs.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1953, Prince Nayef served as vice governor of Riyadh Province. In 1953, he was appointed as the governor of Riyadh province and stayed in this post for one year. He then served as governor of the Medina Region. In 1970, King Faisal appointed him to both deputy interior minister and minister of state for internal affairs.\n\nIn March 1975, after King Faisal's assassination, then-minister of interior Prince Fahd became the crown prince and Prince Nayef was appointed as the minister of interior by King Khalid.\n\nIn December 1994, he ordered hundreds of terrorism-related arrests with the support of Prince Turki, head of Saudi intelligence services.\n\nIn April 2001, he, not foreign minister Saud al Faisal, went to Iran as Saudi envoy in an unprecedented move. He issued all women in Saudi Arabia identity cards. Women were previously registered under their husband's or father's name in November 2001. After the September 11 attacks, as the man in charge of the Saudi investigation he received US criticism for his continuing to insist that the Saudi hijackers were dupes in a Zionist plot for over a year after 9/11, and for not undertaking sufficient action against extremists.\n\nIn 2003, Prince Nayef, who was in charge of foreign labor, decreed that foreign workers and their family members should not exceed 20 percent of the Saudi population in 2013. Senator Charles Schumer lobbied through Prince Bandar to remove Prince Nayef as Minister of Interior in July 2003.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006, he led Saudi Arabia's confrontation against Al Qaeda, which sponsored a series of domestic attacks on expatriate housing compounds, oil infrastructure, and industrial facilities. His political stance was strengthened because of increased media exposure and the successful end to terrorist attacks.\nIn March 2011, during the 2011 Saudi Arabian protests, 200 people who called for more information on their imprisoned relatives were denied a meeting with Nayef.\n\nSince Crown Prince Sultan could not deal with demanding duties due to his extended absences for treatment and King Abdullah was about to travel to Doha to attend the League of Arab States Summit before going to London for the G20 summit, it was imperative to leave a senior official in charge, which added burdens to the leukemia-suffering 76-year-old Nayef. Therefore, on 27 March 2009, Prince Nayef became second deputy prime minister. His appointment caused a rare public split in the royal family. Prince Talal asked the King to clarify that the appointment did not necessarily mean that Nayef would become Crown Prince.\n\nHis appointment as second deputy prime minister expanded Prince Nayef's influence into all corners of Saudi domestic policy and allowed him to participate in the development of foreign policy. He was not expected to interfere in economic matters, but to influence the judiciary.\n\nPrince Nayef chaired many cabinet meetings when King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan were away for health reasons. Critics said he was behind the cancellation of the nation's only film festival in the summer of 2009. In November 2010, he undertook all Hajj-related responsibilities. In some government offices, his picture was added next to King Abdulaziz, King Abdullah, and Crown Prince Sultan.\n\nPrince Nayef was appointed Crown Prince and first deputy prime minister by King Abdullah on 27 October 2011, five days after the death of his full brother, Prince Sultan. Shortly thereafter he vowed that Saudi Arabia would \"never sway from and never compromise on\" its adherence to Wahhabi doctrine which he stated was \"the source of the kingdom's pride, success and progress.\"\n\nDuring his time as Crown Prince, Nayef brought about modernizations such as \"removing religious authorities who objected to the mingling of men and women in public spaces.\"\n\nPrince Nayef's career was propelled by his full-brother King Fahd. Under Fahd, the ministry of interior became one of the most influential bureaucracies in Saudi Arabia. Prince Nayef served as a mediator in disputes between King Fahd and Prince Sultan. As King Fahd's health deteriorated, his power gradually diminished as well. As Crown Prince, Prince Nayef was the most influential of the Sudairi Seven. He delegated the day-to-day responsibilities of his ministry to his son, Prince Muhammad and then-deputy minister Prince Ahmed. Prince Nayef had members of the ministry of interior placed in all overseas embassies.\n\nIn 2003, he \"threatened to cancel certain business deals with the French government\" if the narcotics investigation of Nayef bin Sultan bin Fawwaz al-Shaalan continued.\n\nWhen meeting with US diplomats in 2009, he voiced support for aggressive activity against Iran after what he believed was a breach of the 2001 security agreement. He urged European nations to turn in suspected terrorists and asked for US intercession. He said the most effective way to combat extremism was through Friday sermons.\n\nPrince Nayef served for a time as the supervisor general of the Saudi committee for the Al Quds intifada, which provided aid to Palestinian refugees. He headed the supreme council on information, which oversaw the media and regulated the internet in the country. He also chaired the supreme committee on the Hajj and headed the ministerial committee on morality and the ministerial oversight committee on the World Trade Organization.\n\nPrince Nayef was considered to be one of the more conservative, but also pragmatic, members of the Al Saud family. He viewed the potential erosion of the official Wahhabi-Salafi doctrine as a diminishing of the core legitimacy of the state itself and resisted such moves, not from a pronounced sense of religious devotion, but rather a desire to maintain a firm grip on the levers of state power.\n\nIn November 2002, Prince Nayef said, \"It is impossible that 19 youths carried out the operation of September 11, or that bin Laden or al Qaeda did that alone. ... I think [the Zionists] are behind these events.\" He later proposed that Americans visiting the kingdom should be fingerprinted like visitors to the United States.\n\nAccording to leaked cables, Prince Nayef argued for a tougher approach than King Abdullah towards the then Yemeni president Saleh in 2009. Leaked cables also argued that his views on Iran were more sophisticated and comprehensive than those of King Abdullah.\n\nHis motto was \"no to change, yes to development\". He believed that no change is necessary in Saudi Arabia: “Change means changing something that already exists. Whatever exists in the Kingdom is already well-established; however, there is a scope for development – development that does not clash with the principles of the nation”. In a similar vein, in March 2009, he publicly stated that he saw no need for either elections or women in government.\n\nAfter visiting Cleveland for planned health-tests in March 2012, Prince Nayef addressed the controversy over the participation of Saudi women athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London from his residence in Algeria. According to \"Al Hayat\", he said that women can represent Saudi Arabia at the Olympics as long as they do not break Islamic laws. His approval was conditioned on women competing in sports that \"meet the standards of women's decency and don't contradict Islamic laws\", though even this concession seemed surprising. However, only a few days later, his statement led to other statements by Saudi officials. At a press conference in Jeddah, the head of the Saudi Olympic Committee, Nawwaf bin Faisal, explicitly stated that Saudi women athletes would not be sent to the Olympics: \"We are not endorsing any Saudi female participation at the moment in the Olympics or other international championships.\" He further added that Saudi women taking part on their own are free to do so, and the Kingdom's Olympic authority would \"help in ensuring that their participation does not violate the Islamic shari'a law.\" Though he did emphasize that this was in accordance with a previously stated position, it did seem a rebuff to Crown Prince Nayef.\n\nPrince Nayef, before being appointed second deputy prime minister in 2009, was generally described as elusive, ambiguous, pragmatic, unimaginative, shrewd, and outspoken. According to leaked cables, he had a reputation of being anti-Western, but tended to do business if there were shared interests. It is further stated that his conservative approach did not reflect his personal religious personality (indeed, he was rumored to be a heavy drinker in his younger days). However, his conservative views allowed him to gain support from social and religious conservatives. He seemed to be reserved and even a bit shy. He was described as neither well-spoken nor articulate, and had a tendency to repeat platitudes in private as well as in public. He did appear to understand and speak at least some English. On the other hand, Prince Naif was considered by other princes to be one of the kinder members of his royal generation in his approach towards nephews and nieces.\n\nPrince Nayef and his full brother and then-deputy interior minister, Prince Ahmed, were reported to pay massive bonuses to successful security officers. They both also had a reputation for honesty and using the security budget only for the stated purposes, not enriching themselves.\n\nPrince Nayef married three times. He was the father of ten children.\n\nHis first wife was Noura Alfarraj Alsubaie. Later, they divorced. His child from this marriage is Jawahir, wife of late King Fahd's son, Mohammed bin Fahd, who is former governor of Eastern Province. Jawahir bint Nayef was raised by her aunt Princess Al Jawhara bint Abdulaziz Al Saud.\n\nAl Jawhara bint Abdulaziz bin Musaid Al Jiluwi was his second spouse. His children from this marriage are Muhammad, Noura, Saud and Sara.\n\nHis third wife was Maha bint Mohammed bin Ahmad al-Sudairi. They later divorced. Their children are: Nouf, Nawwaf, Mishail, Hayfa and Fahd. In March 2013, lawyers for the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris won a legal bid at a court in Nanterre, near Paris, to have her assets in France seized, after she was caught absconding in June 2012 owing US$7.5 million having occupied with the entourage a 41-room floor for about 6 months. She is known to have bought three units in central Paris, and goods from her shopping trips around the French capital were believed to have been stored there including leather goods, artworks, jewellery, and clothing worth up to US$15 million.\n\nPrince Nayef was said to be suffering from diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis as well as leukemia. In March 2012, he went to Morocco for a \"private vacation\", then to Cleveland for pre-planned medical tests. This news raised some speculation about his health and Saudi succession. He returned to Saudi Arabia after staying in Algeria in April 2012.\n\nPrince Nayef again left Saudi Arabia for medical tests on 26 May 2012. Although it was unknown where Prince Nayef went, Prince Ahmed stated in \"Al Watan\" on 3 June 2012 that he was \"well and in good health ... and he will soon return to Saudi Arabia\". After his death in June 2012, it was reported that Prince Nayef had gone to Geneva on 26 May 2012 for treatment for a knee ailment.\n\nOn 16 June 2012 at about 1 pm (UTC+3), Saudi state television reported that Crown Prince Nayef had died. According to Reuters, he died in Geneva, Switzerland. A medical source in Geneva said that Nayef died of \"cardiac problems\" while staying at his brother's residence there. His body was kept at the Geneva Mosque before being taken to Jeddah.\n\nThe royal court stated that his funeral would be held on 17 June 2012. It was reported that Crown Prince Nayef's body was brought from Geneva to Jeddah. Funeral prayers were held in the Masjid al-Haram, also known as the Grand Mosque, in Mecca after sunset prayer, led by Sheikh Saud Ash-Shuraim. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in Al Adl cemetery in Mecca as per his wish on 17 June 2012.\n\nMajor political figures sent their condolences to King Abdullah, including US President Barack Obama, French President François Hollande, UK Foreign Minister William Hague, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Turkish President Abdullah Gul, and other leaders of Arab and Persian Gulf States.\n\nOn 6 July 2012, King Abdullah renamed the Qassim Regional Airport in Buraidah as the Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz Regional Airport.\n\nPrince Naif was the recipient of several honours, including the military Order of the Cloud and Banner by Taiwan (1977), the Legion of Honor by France (1977), the Al Kawkab Decoration by Jordan (1977), the Order of National Security by Republic of Korea (1980), and the National Order of the Cedar by Lebanon (2009).

Launched on July 1, 1922, by seven of the sixteen railroad labor organizations in existence at the time, the strike continued into the month of August before collapsing.\n\nAt least ten people, most of them strikers or family members, were killed in connection with the strike. The collective action of some 400,000 workers in the summer of 1922 was the largest railroad work stoppage since the American Railway Union's Pullman Strike of 1894 and the biggest American strike of any kind since the Great Steel Strike of 1919.\n\nDuring American participation in World War I, the American railroad system, the primary mode of freight and passenger transportation in the era, was nationalized by an executive order by President Woodrow Wilson. Operation of the railways was turned over to an institution known as the United States Railroad Administration. A period of relative labor harmony followed, marked by the establishment of the 8-hour day across the railroad industry.\n\nThis interval of labor peace proved short-lived, however, following the return of control of the rail system to private hands by the Transportation Act of 1920. A new bureaucratic entity for coordination of the industry was created at this time, a 9-member panel known as the Railroad Labor Board. This body was given the power to oversee the wages and working conditions of more than 2 million American railway workers.\n\nThe war years had been a period of dramatic inflation across the American economy. Price levels began to turn the other direction in the first years of the 1920s as increased wartime demands upon production were regularized and labor supply was expanded with the reintegration of millions of former soldiers into the employment market. In response to the changing economic conditions, railway companies obtained approval from the Railroad Labor Board in 1921 for deep reductions in wage rates for workers across the industry.\n\nAdditionally, the railway industry was affected by the open shop movement, which was fostered by large employers throughout the American economy, with an increasing percentage of shop work contracted out by the railway companies to non-union subcontractors. During the war, the various railway shop crafts (machinists, boilermakers, blacksmiths, electricians, sheet-metal workers, and laborers) had fully obtained the right to unionize, and they sought to maintain this economic clout. Deep tension developed between employers and railway workers across the country. Attempts by the National Civic Federation in December 1921 to arrive at an amicable remedy to the conflict were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1922 the Railroad Labor Board approved yet another cut in wages, this time a cut of 7 cents an hour targeted to railway repair and maintenance workers, representing a loss of an average of 12% for these workers. The overall economy had subsequently improved from its condition in the previous year, however, and railway workers were particularly aggrieved by the new round of wage reductions.\n\nThe targeted 1922 cut did not affect the members of the \"Big Four\" railway brotherhoods, however, and these unions were not impacted as were the shop workers. Promises were made by the Railroad Labor Board to the so-called \"Big Four\" (the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the Order of Railway Conductors, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen) that no additional wage cuts would be forthcoming. Several others of the 16 American railway unions in existence at the time similarly escaped the latest round of wage reductions.\n\nStrike ballots were sent out to the members of all railway unions over the 1922 wage cuts, but when the votes were counted the members of the \"Big Four,\" brotherhoods broke ranks over the question of a work stoppage. Seven unions representing the railroad shopmen and maintenance of way workers voted to go on strike, however, and the date July 1, 1922, was set for the launch of a coordinated work stoppage. On that day some 400,000 railway workers walked off the job, including nearly 100,000 in the Chicago metropolitan area alone.\n\nWith the conductors, engineers, firemen, and brakemen who actually operated the trains unaffected by the strike, the railroad companies immediately began to replace the skilled and semi-skilled maintenance workers with strikebreakers. In unison, railroads began to establish living facilities for the strikebreakers inside their railway shops and in railroad cars and railroad guards were hired to protect property and defend strikebreakers. Commissaries and kitchens were established to provide for newly-hired workers, and newspaper advertising was published by a number of railway companies in an attempt to win public support for their strikebreaking efforts.\n\nRailway workers were divided not only by craft, however, but also by race. Several of the railway brotherhoods denied African-American workers membership in their ranks on strictly racial grounds; the excluded workers had no economic or moral incentive to honor the work stoppage. Thousands of black railway workers crossed picket lines and helped to undermine strike efforts, but that was not universal; in places like North Carolina, Louisiana, and El Paso, Texas, black workers actively supported the work stoppage.\n\nThe railroads took advantage of the strike to undermine the bargaining position of the workers in their maintenance facilities. On July 3, head of the Railroad Labor Board Ben W. Hooper, a former Republican Governor of Tennessee and political appointee of conservative President Warren G. Harding, pushed through a so-called \"outlaw resolution\" that declared that all strikers had forfeited their arbitration rights guaranteed under the Transportation Act of 1920. Railroads were encouraged by the Railway Labor Board to hire replacement workers, who were to be regarded as permanent by the board.\n\nIn the Eastern United States, a number of railroads attempted to bring pressure to end the strike by stripping strikers of seniority rights. Seniority was important to railroad shop workers in the process of promotion to skilled status as positions became available and in the avoidance of layoffs during slack times, with employees with the least seniority laid off first. The strategy of stripping strikers of their seniority spread rapidly across the country and the issue of retaining seniority, and its associated benefits thereafter became one of the paramount issues of the strike.\n\nBitter labor discord followed. In some towns, local merchants and authorities gave moral and actual help to the strikers, including refusal to sell groceries to strikebreakers and other commercial boycotts and the extension of free goods and discounts to strikers. Picnics were held in support of strikers and in some places, railway guards were disarmed by local sheriffs who were seeking to avert the chance of violence.\n\nWomen came to the aid of striking men by both provisioning those who walked picket lines and walking the lines themselves. Women were also instrumental in some places in pressuring strikers to appear on the picket line and in dissuading strikebreakers from continuing to cross strike lines. In Easton, Pennsylvania, for example, a crowd of 50 women and children pelted strikebreakers with sour milk, rotten eggs, and spoiled produce.\n\nAttempts by state and federal authorities to impose order proved to be an accelerant to the physical nature of the conflict. In the initial phase of the conflict, strikers attempted to set up pickets to close down railroad roundhouses and repair shops. Private guards and law enforcement authorities were quick to remove strikers from private property, however, and with the strikebreakers frequently domiciled on the job site, new and more-violent tactics were used, including the issuance of physical threats, the vandalism of strikebreakers' homes, the destruction of railroad property, and instances of physical violence against strikebreakers.\n\nFor their part, armed company guards fired upon striking workers with a number of deaths resulting, including incidents in Cleveland, Ohio (July 8 and July 16), Buffalo, New York (July 8), Clinton, Illinois, (a worker's teenaged son, July 8; the worker was wounded), Port Morris, New Jersey (July 12), and in Needles, California (July 12). In Wilmington, North Carolina, a company guard took exception to being called a \"scab\" by a non-striking railroad engineer and shot him dead. In Buffalo, a woman and two boys were shot by railroad detectives; the boys suffered mortal injuries according to contemporary newspaper accounts. In addition, at least one company guard was shot and killed following the stopping of a train at Superior, Wisconsin, on August 12.\n\nSome strikers did not hesitate to sabotage trains and tracks when the opportunity arose. In one case a train was switched onto side tracks and the cars set upon by a mob, with rocks and metal parts thrown through glass windows. Sections of track were occasionally disrupted with explosives. Vigilante violence was particularly acute in the South and Southwest, with kidnappings and floggings of strikebreakers common. Union leaders condemned the spontaneous violence of strikers and the sometimes-brutal response of company guards and police officials but with little practical effect.\n\nThe opportunity for a mediated solution to the strike was brief. On July 11, 1922, President Harding issued a proclamation that attempted to split the difference between the two sides in the conflict, recognizing the merit of the workers' grievances and promising not to destroy organized labor but also recognizing the decision of the Railroad Labor Board that strikebreakers were to be regarded as permanent employees, with \"the same indisputable right to work as others have to decline work.\"\n\nThe Railroad Labor Board attempted to mediate an end to the dispute, bringing together union and railroad representatives on July 14 in a joint conference. While the railroad officials pledged to end the subcontracting of work to non-union shops, no retreat was to be made on the issue of restoring seniority to striking workers, and the impasse remained unsettled. Following the failure of this conference, the Railroad Labor Board declared that its efforts to resolve the stoppage had reached an end.\n\nWhile the US Army was not used to defend railroad company interests in the 1922 Shopmen's Strike, the US National Guard was called out, on a state-by-state basis, by various state governors. Troops bolstered armed company guards in their work protecting railroad property and aiding in the defense and transportation of strikebreakers, thereby working to undermine the strike effort.\n\nUS Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, an outspoken opponent of the organized labor movement, was instrumental in escalating the federal government's role in bringing about the defeat of striking railway workers and the restoration of order across the American railroad industry. Daugherty sensationally charged strikers with conducting \"a conspiracy worthy of Lenin and Zinoviev\" and sent US Marshals into the field to aid the railroads in their efforts to defend their property and defeat the strike. Deputy US Marshals were appointed freely, sometimes from pools of \"thugs\" that had been gathered by the railways themselves.\n\nOpposing Daugherty in the inner circle of the Harding administration were Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and Secretary of Labor James John Davis, who sought a negotiated end to the strike. Harding was won over to that approach and professed the belief that the role of the federal government in the dispute should be one of an \"honest broker\" rather than as a violent authority figure.\n\nHarding proposed a settlement on July 28 that would have granted little to the labor unions, but the railroad companies still rejected the compromise, despite interest from the desperate workers. Daugherty, who opposed the unions, pushed for national action against the strike, and on September 1, Judge James H. Wilkerson issued a sweeping injunction against striking, assembling, picketing, and a variety of other union activities; it was colloquially known as the \"Daugherty Injunction:\" \"One of the most extreme pronouncements in American history violating any number of constitutional guarantees of free speech and free assembly. (But) it effectively broke the strike\".\n\nThere was widespread opposition to the injunction, and a number of sympathy strikes shut down some railroads completely, but the strike eventually died out, as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on the local level. The often-unpalatable concessions, coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike, soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for quite some time.\n\n\n\n"}

However Article 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia encourages people to come forward with information by providing them with a statutory defence to treason and other offences:\n\nMisprision of treason is an offence under the common law of England and Wales and the common law of Northern Ireland. By statute, the offence of misprision of treason under the common law of England has been made an offence which is cognisable under the law of Scotland. This offence was formerly known as misprision of high treason in order to distinguish it from misprision of petty treason, before that offence was abolished along with its parent offence in 1828.\n\nThe crime is committed where a person knows that treason is being planned or committed and does not report it as soon as he can to a justice of the peace or other authority. The offender does not need to consent to the treason; mere knowledge is enough. Concealment of treason was itself a treason at common law until the Treason Act 1554 deemed it merely misprision of treason, which was a felony.\n\nIn R v.

Under the prevailing influences of Italy at that time, Westmacott devoted all his energies to the study of classical sculpture, and throughout his life his real sympathies were with pagan rather than with Christian art. Within a year of his arrival in Rome he won the first prize for sculpture offered by the Florentine Academy of Arts, and in the following year he gained the papal gold medal awarded by the Academy of St Luke with his bas-relief of Joseph and his brethren. On returning to England in 1797, he set up a studio, where John Edward Carew and Musgrave Watson gained experience.\nWestmacott had his own foundry at Pimlico, in London, where he cast both his own works, and those of other sculptors, including John Flaxman's statue of Sir John Moore for Glasgow. Late in life he was asked by the Office of Works for advice on the casting of the reliefs for Nelson’s Column. He also had an arrangement with the Trustees of the British Museum, which allowed him to make moulds and supply plaster casts of classical sculpture in the museum's collection to country house owners, academies and other institutions.\nHe exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1797 and 1839. His name is given in the catalogues as \"R. Westmacott, Junr.\" until 1807, when the \"Junr.\" was dropped. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1805, and a full academician in 1811; his diploma work, a marble relief of \"Jupiter and Ganymede\", is still in the academy's collection. He was professor of sculpture at the academy from 1827 until his death. He received his knighthood on 19 July 1837.\n\nAmong his works are the reliefs for the north side of Marble Arch, the sculptures of figures representing \"The Rise of Civilisation\" on the pediment of the British Museum, and the Waterloo Vase now in Buckingham Palace Gardens. This enormous urn was sculpted from chunks of marble earmarked by Napoleon for a trophy commemorating his anticipated victory in the Napoleonic Wars and then given to George IV as a gift from the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nHis statue of Horatio Nelson, Birmingham was the first statue of Nelson in Britain. There are other monuments to the admiral by Westmacott at Bull Ring, Birmingham, and Barbados, while that at Liverpool was modelled and cast by Westmacott, to a design by Matthew Cotes Wyatt. In Liverpool there is also an equestrian statue of King George III sculpted by Westmacott, which was unveiled in 1822. He was responsible for the statue of the agriculturalist and developer Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford in Russell Square, and the one of the Duke of York on top of the column in Waterloo place. His \"Achilles\" in Hyde Park, a bronze copy of an antique sculpture from Monte Cavallo in Rome, is a tribute to the Duke of Wellington, paid for by £10,000 raised by female subscribers.\nHis sculptures of poetical subjects were in a style similar to those of the contemporary Italian school: his works of this type included \"Psyche\" and \"Cupid\" for the Duke of Bedford; \"Euphrosyne\" for the Duke of Newcastle; \"A Nymph Unclasping her Zone\"; \"The Distressed Mother\" and \"The Houseless Traveller\".\n\nWestmacott also sculpted the memorials to Pitt the Younger, Spencer Perceval, Charles James Fox and Joseph Addison in Westminster Abbey; the statue of Fox in Bloomsbury Square; and those to Sir Ralph Abercromby, Lord Collingwood and Generals Pakenham and Gibbs in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nHis other sepulchural monuments include those to Lt. General Christopher Jeaffreson (died 1824) in St.Mary's Church in Dullingham;> to Commander Charles Cotton (died 1828) at St. Mary's Church in Madingley; to William Pemberton (died 1828) at St Margaret's Church in Newton, South Cambridgeshire; to Sir George Warren (died 1801) at St. Mary's Church, Stockport, Greater Manchester, depicting a standing female figure by an urn on a pillar; to Rev. Charles Prescott (died 1820), in St. Mary's Church, Stockport, showing a seated effigy and to Mary Henson (died 1805) in Bainton parish church, showing a seated figure against an urn.\n\nHe created a sculptural group for the marble arch of the Cumberland Gate to Hyde Park.\n\nWestmacott lived and died at 14 South Audley Street, Mayfair, London where he is commemorated by a blue plaque. In 1798 he married Dorothy Margaret Wilkinson. Their son, also called Richard Westmacott, followed closely in his footsteps also becoming a notable sculptor, a Royal Academician and professor of sculpture at the academy.\n\nWestmacott is buried in a tomb at St Mary's Church at Chastleton, Oxfordshire, where his third son Horatio was rector in 1878.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1951059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951059", "title": "Nancy Kelsey", "text": "Nancy Kelsey\n\nNancy Kelsey (August 1, 1823, Barren County, Kentucky – August 10, 1896, Cuyama, California) was a member of the Bartleson-Bidwell party. She was the first white woman to travel overland from Missouri, seeing Utah and Nevada before crossing the Sierra Nevada mountains into California on November 25, 1841. Wife of Benjamin Kelsey, and the mother of eight surviving children, she is sometimes referred to as the \"Betsy Ross of California\" for her role in creation of the original Bear Flag from which Bear Flag Rebellion got its name.\n\nBorn in Barren County, Kentucky, her family moved to Jackson County, Missouri when she was three years old.\n\nNancy married Benjamin \"Ben\" Kelsey on October 25, 1838 in Henry County, Missouri. Her husband and his brothers, David, Samuel and Andrew had settled a section in the Hoffman Bend area of what would become St. Clair County, Missouri and had already been in some trouble with the authorities. There were some shady dealings in real estate; Samuel was indicted for murder, and a lawsuit was filed against Andrew in 1841. After his brothers left for the west, David remained behind as David Kelso in Missouri, taking care of their elderly father, Samuel Kelsey Sr.\n\nNancy Kelsey was 17 years old in 1841 when Ben decided to travel west after reading doctor John Marsh's letter describing his trip by sea through the Strait of Magellan to the San Joaquin Valley of California.\n\nBefore they left Missouri, her second child, named after his uncle Samuel, died after only eight days. Shortly thereafter on May 18, 1841, Ben and Nancy with their one-year-old daughter, Martha Ann, and Kelsey's brothers joined John Bidwell as members of the first wagon train to California. The group had at least one wedding on the trail. Father Pierre-Jean De Smet performed the ceremony for Nancy Kelsey's sister \"Betsey Grey\" and her new husband Richard Phelan before the two emigrant groups and the priest's parties split up in August 1841.\n\nOne emigrant group, including some of the Kelsey family as well as Nancy's sister and new husband, went directly to Oregon. The other group – including Nancy, Martha Ann and Ben Kelsey – took the route detailed in Marsh's letter, which Marsh had never seen, through Utah and Nevada.\n\nMany years later, an interview with Nancy Kelsey was published in the \"San Francisco Examiner\" where she recollected the trip across the continent; she said the group had no guide and no compass. Nancy Kelsey was the first white woman to see the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The emigrants had been told to not go too far south or north of the lake, but to strike westward from it. On September 16, the wagons and most of their contents were left on the west face of Nevada's Ruby Mountains, near Owens Lake and the present day Oasis, Nevada.\n\nAfter abandoning the wagons, the party proceeded on foot with pack horses. The party was attacked several times, witnessed the fatal remains of other ambushes, and had their provisions and horses stolen. Nancy was quoted:\nWe left our wagons and finished our journey on horse-back and drove our cattle. I carried my baby in front of me on the horse. At one place the Indians surrounded us, armed with their bows and arrows, but my husband leveled his gun at the chief and made him order his Indians out of arrow range.\n\nOn September 24, they found the Mary's River that was in Marsh's description; now called the Humboldt River, it ends in the Humboldt Sink, an intermittent dry lake bed and by October 15, they were at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The 34 members of the party arrived in California via the Sonora Pass and followed the Stanislaus River down hill. They reached the confluence with the San Joaquin River on November 3, and several members of the group, including the Kelsey's, stopped at Doctor Marsh's ranch at the foot of Mount Diablo on November 4, 1841. The Kelseys stayed a month with Marsh before proceeding to Sutter's Fort. Subsequently, several of the group wrote of Nancy's patience, heroism and kindness on the journey. She is credited with being the first white woman to see Utah, Nevada, the first to cross the Sierra Nevada and the first to travel overland from Missouri to California.\n\nDuring 1842, Nancy and Ben Kelsey worked for John Sutter collecting elk hides at Clear Lake, California. In 1843, while she was pregnant, they left Sutter's employ and drove cattle north along the California-Oregon Trail east of Mount Shasta, past Klamath Lake, and on to Oregon City. Along the way, they were attacked nearly constantly by Native Americans, one of whom was shot dead very close to Nancy. While in Oregon, Nancy delivered Sarah Jane Kelsey, who died after eight days. Nancy became pregnant almost immediately and delivered daughter Margaret September 14, 1843 in Oregon. After selling their cattle, the family loaded up with goods and returned to California where they settled on at Calistoga, neighboring General Vallejo's property to the south. Ben's brothers Isaac and Samuel with their families arrived in northern California at the end of 1843; they had started with the Bidwell party but branched off for Oregon. David Kelsey arrived separately, but died in 1845 of smallpox.\n\nIn 1844 the Kelsey home about south of Calistoga was attacked by Native Americans. Nancy Kelsey rolled her daughter into a blanket; both survived. While tensions were growing in the spring of 1846, Nancy delivered son Andrew Kelsey on April 7, bringing the total of living children to three.\n\nDuring the Bear Flag Rebellion in 1846, while the Kelsey brothers joined John C. Fremont in declaring California's independence from Mexico, Nancy Kelsey, Mrs. John Sears, and Mrs. Benjamin Dewell sewed the original \"Bear Flag\" from a pattern drawn by William L. Todd, a nephew of Mary Todd Lincoln. Nancy Kelsey has been referred to as the \"Betsy Ross of California\" for her contributions to the flag, after which the Bear Flag Rebellion was named. The words \"California Republic\" were inked in pokeberry juice, the fabrics borrowed from the little available and many said the bear looked more like a pig but it only had to serve for twenty-four days from June 14, 1846 until the U.S. Navy claimed California for the U.S. and raised an American flag at Monterey. On June 28, 1846, Fremont and Ben Kelsey became enemies when Kelsey refused to kill José de los Reyes Berreyesa, a Mexican neighbor and the twin sons of Francisco de Haro; they were killed by Kit Carson.\n\nIn 1848, Nancy delivered Mary Ellen Kelsey on June 26 at Sutter's Fort. Ben left Nancy and the four children behind when he took fifty Pomo men from his brother Andrew's ranch southwest of present-day Kelseyville, on Rancho Lupyomi at the American River, in the Sierra foothills to mine for gold. They established a mining camp called Kelsey Diggings in the Sierra foothills near Sutter's Mill.\n\nOnce at the diggings, he sold all the company's supplies to other miners and returned home to Sonoma, ill with malaria, but with a $16,000 profit. At this time, while still sick, he shot a Native American dead for \"accosting\" Nancy who had ridden from home to town to get him medicine. Only one or two of their abandoned Pomo workers survived in hostile territory, suffering from starvation and malaria. Andrew Kelsey and another partner, surnamed Stone, had forced the wife of one of their workers into concubinage and sent her husband off to live with Nancy and Ben Kelsey. When the mistreated husband returned to his people, he was tortured. Shortly thereafter, Stone and Andrew Kelsey were killed, but the details are highly variable among sources. This event provoked the Bloody Island Massacre, although the 60-100 Pomo Indians who were killed on Bloody Island by the U.S. Army and volunteers were not the ones responsible for the deaths of Stone and Kelsey.\n\nSeeking revenge, Ben Kelsey and a group of vigilantes called \"The Sonoma Gang\" murdered \"dozens of innocent Native Americans in Napa and Sonoma counties\" in retribution for Andrew's murder. Seven of the vigilantes – but not Ben Kelsey – were captured and charged with murder, but bailed for $10,000 in the first-ever decision by the Supreme Court of California. Abandoning their bail, at least three of the seven sailed for Humboldt Bay aboard the schooner \"Ryerson\".\n\nIn April 1850, the Union Company was formed by 33 members - including survivors of the Josiah Gregg expedition to Humboldt Bay - with the goal of finding and settling lands around Humboldt Bay to supply the inland mines. Of the 33, ten were part of the Sonoma Gang, including Ben Kelsey.\n\nIn September 1850, Ben and his brother Samuel came to Humboldt County, California, rejoining the other members of the Union Company, including five of the seven released members of the Sonoma Gang. Ben had killed a Native American chief on their overland trip to Humboldt Bay and his reputation got to town before they did, a Eureka correspondent wrote: \"Kelsey of Sonoma (the Indian killer) is on his way here with his own and several other families.\" Nancy and Ben built a fancy house at the northwest corner of the Arcata Plaza, at 9th and H streets. The Kelsey men burned two Wiyot villages and killed several Native Americans. They were in northwestern California about twenty-two months during which time Kelsey's brothers had injured and killed natives and caused harm to intercultural relationships that would lead to the 1860 Wiyot Massacre, while Ben opened up wagon trails to the mining areas from Crescent City, California. The Kelsey National Recreation trail follows of the route between Scott River Road and Paradise Lake.\n\nNancy delivered Nancy Rose on February 14, 1851 in Sonoma at about the same time as Ben Kelsey became sick with tuberculosis. They lost their fancy house in Arcata to foreclosure after which Ben, Nancy and the four children moved around a lot through Sacramento and San Joaquin to Mariposa for two months, then lived for eight months in San Jose. On March 18, 1855, Nancy delivered Georgia Ann. The family lived in Oakland for one year, moved to Gilroy for fourteen months, and moved again to the Kern River mines where Kelsey mined and operated a toll bridge for 18 months. From there, the family moved to Four Creeks for two years and finally to Mexico in late 1859 after Nancy delivered her last child, William Wallus Kelsey, on October 22 in Arizona, bringing the family to eight surviving children (out of 10 pregnancies), six girls and two boys.\n\nSeeking drier weather for her husband, the family moved to Mexico in 1859, and then to Texas in 1861 where Nancy, Martha Ann and two younger daughters survived an attack by Comanche. Nancy loaded guns and told the children to hide. Her two oldest girls hid, but 12-year-old Mary Ellen was captured and found the next day scalped, stabbed and with a fractured skull which she survived but suffered mental illness until her death six years later\n\nIn 1864, the family returned to California, at first in San Luis Obispo, then settling near Fresno in 1865. The wandering continued; the family moved to Inyo County, survived the approximately 8.0 1872 Lone Pine earthquake, which Ben said was the only thing that ever frightened him. Ben worked in the Cerro Gordo Mines, and finally the family moved to Los Angeles where Ben Kelsey died on February 19, 1889, aged 76.\n\nNancy Kelsey outlived her husband and spent her final years on farms in Santa Barbara County, California, where she was a midwife and an herbalist. Her vocabulary was described by one newspaperman as such that \"would have given any genteel hostess the vapors.\" She told her interviewer of her eventful life \"I have enjoyed riches and suffered the pangs of poverty. I have seen U.S. Grant when he was little known; I have baked bread for General Fremont and talked to Kit Carson. I have run from bear and killed most all other kinds of smaller game.\" She had borne eight surviving children, out of 10 pregnancies. while moving over much of the American west and in and out of Mexico. In 1937 the Native Daughters of the Golden West put a bronze plaque on Nancy Kelsey's grave at the head of Cottonwood Canyon in the Cuyama River Valley. On April 1, 1995, Oregon-California Trails Association placed a commemorative marker on her grave.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951074", "title": "Antoine-Augustin Parmentier", "text": "Antoine-Augustin Parmentier\n\nAntoine-Augustin Parmentier (, , ; Montdidier 12 August 1737 – 13 December 1813) is remembered as a vocal promoter of the potato as a food source for humans in France and throughout Europe. His many other contributions to nutrition and health included establishing the first mandatory smallpox vaccination campaign (under Napoleon beginning in 1805, when he was Inspector-General of the Health Service) and pioneering the extraction of sugar from sugar beets. Parmentier also founded a school of breadmaking, and studied methods of conserving food, including refrigeration.\n\nWhile serving as an army pharmacist for France in the Seven Years' War, he was captured by the Prussians, and in prison in Prussia was faced with eating potatoes, known to the French only as hog feed. The potato had been introduced from South America to Europe by the Spaniards at the beginning of the 16th century. It was introduced to the rest of Europe by 1640, but (outside Spain and Ireland) was usually used only for animal feed. King Frederick II of Prussia had required peasants to cultivate the plants under severe penalties and had provided them cuttings. In 1748 the French Parliament had actually forbidden the cultivation of the potato (on the grounds that it was thought to cause leprosy among other things), and this law remained on the books in Parmentier's time, until 1772.\n\nFrom his return to Paris in 1763 he pursued his pioneering studies in nutritional chemistry. His prison experience came to mind in 1772 when he proposed (in a contest sponsored by the Academy of Besançon) use of the potato as a source of nourishment for dysenteric patients. He won the prize on behalf of the potato in 1773.\n\nDue largely to Parmentier's efforts, the Paris Faculty of Medicine declared potatoes edible in 1772. Still, resistance continued, and Parmentier was prevented from using his test garden at the Invalides hospital, where he was pharmacist, by the religious community that owned the land, whose complaints resulted in the suppression of Parmentier's post at the Invalides.\n\nIn 1779, Parmentier was appointed to teach at the Free School of Bakery to help stabilize Paris' food supply by making bread in a more cost-efficient fashion. In that same year, he published \"Manière de faire le pain de pommes de terre, sans mélange de farine\", in which he described how one can make potato bread that still has all the characteristics of wheat bread.\n\nParmentier then began a series of publicity stunts for which he remains notable today, hosting dinners at which potato dishes featured prominently and guests included luminaries such as Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier, giving bouquets of potato blossoms to the king and queen, and surrounding his potato patch at Sablons with armed guards during the day to suggest valuable goods and withdrawing them at night so people could steal the potatoes. These 54 \"arpents\" of impoverished ground near Neuilly, west of Paris, had been allotted him by order of Louis XVI in 1787.\n\nIn 1771, Parmentier won an essay contest in which all the judges voted the potato as the best substitute for regular flour. This was before a time France needed a replacement for wheat, so Parmentier continued to face criticism and lack of acknowledgment for his work. \nThe first step in the acceptance of the potato in French society was a year of bad harvests, 1785, when the scorned potatoes staved off famine in the north of France. In 1789, Parmentier published \n\"Treatise on the Culture and Use of the Potato, Sweet Potato, and Jerusalem Artichoke\" \n(\"Traité sur la culture et les usages des Pommes de terre, de la Patate, et du Topinambour\"), \"printed by order of the king\", giving royal backing to potato eating, albeit on the eve of the French Revolution, leaving it up to the Republicans to accept it. In 1794, Madame Mérigot published \"La Cuisinière Républicaine\" (\"The [Female] Republican Cook\"), the first potato cookbook, promoting potatoes as food for the common people.\nParmentier's agronomic interests covered a wide range of opportunities to ameliorate the human lot through technical improvements; he published his observations touching on bread-baking, cheese-making, grain storage, the use of cornmeal (maize) and chestnut flour, mushroom culture, mineral waters, wine-making, improved sea biscuits, and a host of other topics of interest to the Physiocrats.\n\nStarting in the 1870s, many dishes including potatoes were named in honor of Parmentier: \"potage, velouté,\" or \"crème Parmentier\", a potato and leek soup; \"hachis Parmentier\", a cottage or shepherd's pie; \"brandade de morue parmentier\", salt cod mashed with olive oil and potatoes; \"pommes\" or \"garniture Parmentier\", cubed potatoes fried in butter; \"purée Parmentier\", mashed potatoes; \"salade Parmentier\", potato salad.\n\nParmentier died on 13 December 1813, aged 76. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, in a plot ringed by potato plants, and his name is given to a long avenue in the 10th and 11th arrondissements (and a station on line 3 of the Paris Métro). At Montdidier, his bronze statue surveys \"Place Parmentier\" from its high socle, while below in full marble relief, seed potatoes are distributed to a grateful peasant. Another monumental statue of Parmentier, by French sculptor Adrien Étienne Gaudez, is erected in the square of the town hall of Neuilly-sur-Seine.\n\n"}
{"id": "1951079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951079", "title": "Battle of Abukir (1799)", "text": "Battle of Abukir (1799)\n\nThe Battle of Abukir (or Aboukir or Abu Qir) was a battle in which Napoleon Bonaparte defeated Seid Mustafa Pasha's Ottoman army on July 25, 1799, during the French campaign in Egypt. It is considered the first pitched battle with this name, as there already was a naval battle on August 1, 1798 (a second pitched battle followed on March 8, 1801). No sooner had the French forces returned from a campaign to Syria, than the Ottoman forces were transported to Egypt by Sidney Smith's British fleet to put an end to French rule in Egypt.\n\nSeid Mustafa Pasha was an experienced commander who had fought against the Russians. He knew that cavalry charges against the French squares were futile. So, he sought to avoid them by fortifying his beachhead with two defensive lines. From this beachhead Mustafa could carry out the invasion of Egypt. However, Napoleon immediately saw the flaw in the tactic as it meant that the Turks had nowhere to run if routed.\n\nThe French attacked the Ottoman positions and quickly broke through the first defensive line before it was fully completed. The second line, however, proved tougher to defeat and the French withdrew for a while. At this point, cavalry general Murat saw his opportunity and attacked with his cavalry, quickly routing the exposed Turks.\n\nMurat's charge was so rapid that he burst inside Mustafa's tent and captured the Turkish commander, severing two of the Turk's fingers with his sabre. In return, Mustafa shot Murat in the jaw. Immediately, Murat was operated on and resumed his duties the next day.\n\nThe Turkish army fled in panic. Some Ottomans drowned trying to swim to the British ships two miles away from shore, while others fled to Abukir castle, but they surrendered shortly thereafter. The Turks suffered about 8,000 casualties and the French only 1,000. News of the victory reached France before Napoleon arrived in October and this made him even more popular, an important asset considering the troubles brewing in the French Directory. This battle temporarily secured France's control over Egypt.\n\nThe Ottoman army led by Britain declared war on France. Two armies were to attack Egypt: one carried by the British fleet, the other concentrated in north Syria. As usual, Bonaparte chose to take the initiative: in February 1799 he conquered Gaza, El Arish and Jaffa but failed before the town of Saint-Jean-d'Acre after two months of siege. This city was defended by its governor, Djezzar Pasha and his former fellow student of the Ecole Militaire in Paris, Antoine de Phélippeaux, an excellent gunner. In addition, the city was continually replenished with men, food, water and other necessities by the British Navy. The French army being decimated by the plague, Napoleon ended his dreams of conquest in the East. He dreamed of taking Constantinople and then invading India to help the local insurgency against the British. He also dreamed that once in Constantinople, he could return with his army to France through Vienna.\n\nOn July 14, 1799, a British fleet of 60 ships landed with 16,000 men under the command of Mustapha Pasha, a veteran of the last Russo-Turkish war. They stormed the fortifications of the harbor and put 300 French troops under the command of Battalion Chief Godart, \"hors de combat\". The peninsula changed hands and Turkish flags fluttered on the bastions of the city.\n\nProud of this success, Mustapha Pasha was in no hurry to march on Cairo. Murad Bey, who managed to escape and join him, said, \"The French dreaded that you could not support the presence, I watch, and they are fleeing before me.\" and Murad replied, \"Pasha, be glad that it suits the French to withdraw, because if they turned, you would disappear before them like dust before the north wind.\"\n\nNapoleon brought together as many troops as possible. Without waiting for Kleber, he approached Abukir with the divisions of Lannes, Desaix and Murat's cavalry, 7,700 men and 1,000 horsemen and the Turks gathered 18,000 men, 8,000 of whom were in a condition to fight. According to François Furet and Denis Richet (\"French Revolution\", Macmillan 1970, XI-14), the clash between the two armies took place near Alexandria, but the victorious French called it \"the battle of Abu Qir\" (or Aboukir) to revenge the former defeat of 1-3 August 1798.\n\nOn July 25, the Turks were on the defensive and relied on a strong redoubt between their lines and the sea. The British, too far from shore because of shallow waters, could not use their artillery against the French. Bonaparte established his artillery on the heights, but his first attack was a failure, because Desaix stalled and Murat dared not proceed when he saw the shot flying above his head.\n\nPasha took advantage of the lull, and attacked the fort with his men, decapitating fallen French troops. Rage seized the French, who without orders, rushed into the enemy ranks. Murat wheeled his cavalry driving quickly through the Turkish lines and ended up behind the town, cutting off Mustapha Pasha's retreat. Murat captured Mustapha Pasha in single combat.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the Turkish army drowned while trying to swim to Turkish gunboats and the British vessels; while 3,000 Ottomans succeeded in taking refuge in the fort. Lacking the rallying force of their commander, they were forced by thirst and hunger to surrender two days later.\n\nMurat was promoted to the General rank of the evening division.\n\nThe French suffered only 220 dead and 600 wounded while the Turkish losses were enormous: 2,000 dead on the battlefield, 4,000 men drowned, 1,000 dead and 1,500 prisoners captured from the fort of Abukir.\n\nSidney Smith, admiral of the British fleet, blamed the defeat on the Ottoman chiefs, as they had not followed his advice to seize the town of Rosetta in order to isolate Alexandria. Furthermore, the Ottomans did not engage all their troops from the objective for the capture of Alexandria.\n\nAbukir gave the French a few months respite. Desaix continued through Upper Egypt in search of Murad Bey.\n\nOn August 23, leaving the command to Kleber, Bonaparte embarked on the frigate \"Muiron\", with Berthier, Murat, Lannes and others, because, from reading the British newspapers, he had learned of the recent defeats of the Directory. On this occasion, he earned the nickname \"General Good Catch\".\n\nIn the long term, a French presence in Egypt was impossible to maintain. Kleber did restore French rule over the country thanks to his victory at Heliopolis on March 18, 1800, but less than a month later he was murdered in his garden in Cairo by a student of theology. Kleber's successor, Menou, lacking the skills of a war leader, was defeated at Canopus and surrendered on September 2. Under the convention signed with the British, the French army came back to France in British ships.\n"}

In contemporary Mexico, it generally refers to meats or whole sheep or whole goats slow-cooked over an open fire or, more traditionally, in a hole dug in the ground covered with agave (\"maguey\") leaves, although the interpretation is loose, and in the present day (and in some cases) may refer to meat steamed until tender. This meat is known for its high fat content and strong flavor, often accompanied with onions and cilantro (coriander).\n\nIn the U.S., \"barbacoa\" is often prepared with parts from the heads of cattle, such as the cheeks. In northern Mexico, it is also sometimes made from beef head, but more often it is prepared from goat meat (\"cabrito\"). In central Mexico, the meat of choice is lamb, and in the Yucatan, their traditional version, \"cochinita pibil\" (pit-style pork), is prepared with pork.\n\nBarbacoa was later adopted into the cuisine of the southwestern United States by way of Texas. The word transformed in time to \"barbecue\", as well as many other words related to ranching and Tex-Mex cowboy or vaquero life. Considered a specialty meat, barbacoa is only sold on weekends or holidays in certain parts of South Texas and in all of Mexico. Barbacoa is also popular in Florida, as many Mexican immigrants living there have introduced this dish. Barbacoa is also well known in Honduras.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Visayan dish \"balbacua\" (also spelled \"balbakwa\") is named after barbacoa, probably for the similar length of cooking time and tenderness of the meat. It is a completely different dish. Unlike Latin American versions, it is a stew made from beef, oxtail, cow feet and skin boiled for several hours until gelatinous and extremely tender.\nA traditional Mexican way of eating barbacoa is having it served on warm corn tortillas with salsa for added flavor; the tacos are often eaten with diced onions, chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice.\n\nThe word \"barbacoa\" is believed to have come from the mainland Taino, as in this source:\n\n<poem>\n\nBut when we take the term 'barbacoa', which originates from Arawak (specifically, the Taíno language), it is known thanks to the writings of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo in his \"Natural and General History of the Indians\", who described two of its meanings.</poem>\n\n"}
{"id": "1951096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951096", "title": "Ruth Laredo", "text": "Ruth Laredo\n\nRuth Laredo (November 20, 1937May 25, 2005) was an American classical pianist.\n\nShe became known in the 1970s in particular for her premiere recordings of the 10 sonatas of Scriabin and the complete solo piano works of Rachmaninoff, for her Ravel recordings and, in the last sixteen and a half years before her death, for her series in the Metropolitan Museum of Art “Concerts with Commentary”. She was often referred to as “America's First Lady of the Piano”.\n\nRuth Meckler was born on November 20, 1937 in Detroit, Michigan, the elder of two daughters of Miriam Meckler-Horowitz, a piano teacher, and Ben Meckler, an English teacher. When she was only two years old, she was already able to play \"God Bless America\" on the piano of her mother, without being taught.\n\nWhen she was eight years old, her mother took her to a concert of Vladimir Horowitz in the Masonic Auditorium in Detroit. After the concert she vowed to become a concert pianist herself. Horowitz played Scriabin, and Laredo was so fascinated by this music that she developed a lifelong passion for Scriabin and other Russian composers, including Scriabin's contemporary Rachmaninoff.\n\nIn 1960 she moved to New York City and married the Bolivian-born violinist Jaime Laredo, who was three and a half years younger than she. She knew him at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and they performed together regularly until their divorce in 1974 (in some publications erroneously given as 1976). Their union produced a daughter in 1969, Jennifer, who is married to Paul Watkins, chief conductor and music director of the English Chamber Orchestra. Jennifer Laredo Watkins lives in London.\n\nDuring the pregnancy and after the birth of her daughter, Ruth Laredo had to cut back on touring with her husband. Keen to record the music of Scriabin, she approached various record companies with the proposal to record all 10 sonatas by the composer. Alan Silver from the Connoisseur Society agreed to take the risk, although initially only for one LP (Sonatas No. 5, No. 7, “White Mass”, No. 9, “Black Mass”, Eight Etudes, Op. 42). After the success of this first recording, Connoisseur engaged her to record the remaining seven sonatas, thus making Laredo the first pianist to have recorded the complete sonatas of Scriabin. This milestone marked the beginning of her public acclaim as a solo artist.\n\nIn retrospect, Laredo explained in \"The Ruth Laredo Becoming a Musician Book\" (published in 1992) that this was an alternative way to embark upon a solo career: to find a niche of repertoire, something nobody had done before. The more obvious route would be to win competitions, but she never had – apart from the Young Concert Artists International Auditions – any success in important competitions.\n\nWhen her daughter was older, Laredo was ready to resume touring with her husband, but was now confronted with his wish to divorce. The divorce, executed in 1974, pushed Laredo into a personal crisis. She took a teaching job at Yale University and accepted the invitation of Thomas Z. Shepard from CBS Masterworks, who was impressed by the Scriabin recordings, to record the complete solo piano works of Rachmaninoff. This, said Laredo, saved her life and with the Rachmaninoff recordings, made from 1974 to 1979 (the latest album released in 1981), her solo career was definitely gathering momentum.\n\nAfter her landmark recordings, the international music publisher C. F. Peters commissioned Ruth Laredo to edit a new Urtext edition of the complete 24 Preludes of Rachmaninoff. They were published in 1981 (Op. 3, No. 2), 1985 (Op. 23) and 1991 (Op. 32). Laredo had thought that many of the markings in the commonly used Rachmaninoff editions were not those of the composer; after studying original manuscripts which she found at the Library of Congress and in the Rachmaninoff archive in Washington, D.C., and later also in the Glinka Museum during her tour to Russia in 1989, her suspicions were confirmed. Her new editions were much closer to the composer's original manuscripts.\n\nLaredo wrote also articles for the magazines \"Piano Today\" and \"Keyboard Classics\" and hosted programs for National Public Radio (NPR), \"Performance Today\" and \"Morning Edition\") and the New York classical radio station \"WQXR (First Hearing\" and \"Onstage with Young Concert Artists\").\n\nIn 2000, Laredo appeared in a scene of Woody Allen's movie \"Small Time Crooks\", in which Hugh Grant's character tries to impress Tracey Ullman's character by taking her to a piano recital, where Ruth Laredo is playing Rachmaninoff.\n\nRuth Laredo was also known for the striking gowns (most of them made by Lincoln Center's costume designer Catherine Heiser) she wore on stage, which were frequently published in fashion magazines. She was often seen riding her bicycle or jogging while listening to the music of Phil Collins or the rock group Genesis around Manhattan's Upper West Side, where she lived.\n\nShe had a strong commitment to Jewish tradition. In a lecture of the \"Concerts with Commentary\" series about Felix Mendelssohn, she discussed the significance and depth of his Jewish background. Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy's decision to convert to Protestantism, said Laredo, was a practical one to ensure his son's acceptance into the music profession of Germany.\n\nRuth Laredo died on May 25, 2005 in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment. The cause of death was ovarian cancer, a diagnosis which was made four years before her death but which did not stop her from giving concerts. She is buried in Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York, only a few meters away from the grave of Sergei Rachmaninoff, who was so important to her life. At the funeral on May 31, 2005, two of her closest colleagues performed: Wei Gang Li from the Shanghai Quartet, and Courtenay Budd, with whom – along with the St. Petersburg String Quartet – she had given her last “Concert with Commentary” on May 6, 2005.\n\nOn May 18, 2006, her daughter Jennifer organised a memorial concert in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The participants were the Guarneri Quartet (with Paul Watkins, Jennifer's husband), Courtenay Budd, Nicolas Kendall, Pei Yao Wang, Edmund Battersby, James Tocco as well as Susan Wadsworth, director of the \"Young Concert Artists\", and the flutist Paula Robison. Courtenay Budd sang Ruth Laredo's favourite song, Franz Schubert's \"An die Musik\", the title of which Jennifer Laredo Watkins chose for the inscription of her mother's gravestone.\n\nIn 2007 the Ruth Laredo Memorial Prize of the Young Concert Artists International Auditions was endowed with the contributions of the family and worldwide friends and admirers of Ruth Laredo. She herself won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions Award in 1962 and later was a frequent and devoted member of the Jury of the Auditions (winners of the Memorial Prize so far are: Benjamin Moser, Germany, pianist; Bella Hristova, Bulgaria, violinist; Charlie Albright, US, pianist; and George Li, US, pianist).\n\nRuth Laredo's mother Miriam Meckler, a piano teacher mainly for children, taught Ruth first. When the time came for more formal training in 1947, she sent her to Edward Bredshall. Bredshall had studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and was known for his effective methods of teaching. She studied with him four years, and he introduced her to the music of other Russian composers, notably Prokofiev, Stravinsky and Kabalevsky.\n\nHer preference for Russian music led her to team up with a Russian émigré, Mischa Kottler, who also was the teacher of the pianist and singer Muriel Elizabeth Charbonneau and later of the saxophonist and composer Rick Margitza and the jazz pianist Ray Cooke.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1955 Laredo attended Mumford High School in Detroit. During summer vacations she enjoyed the Indian Hill Summer Workshops in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. After her graduation in 1955 she began her studies with Rudolf Serkin at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. She had been introduced to Serkin in 1954 by the violinist Berl Senofsky and the pianist Seymour Lipkin, both of whom she knew from the summer camps. Serkin told her at her audition in Marlboro, Vermont: “I can see that you play like a tiger!” He accepted her as one of only four students.\n\nRudolf Serkin, a student of Arnold Schoenberg and himself an artist of worldwide reputation, was known for his complete dedication to the music, and his fidelity to the composer. At first, he took a dim view of Laredo's passion for the music of Russian composers; his tastes ran to the Mozart-Beethoven-Schubert-Brahms line of Central European composers. Despite this, Ruth Laredo would become known later for her Scriabin and Rachmaninoff recordings and performances.\n\nRuth Laredo spent many summers at the Marlboro Music School and Festival near Brattleboro, Vermont, which had been founded in 1950 by Rudolf Serkin and Adolf Busch (then called \"School of Music\"). There she continued her studies with Serkin and was coached in chamber music by the cellist Pablo Casals. Fellow students included Murray Perahia, Richard Goode (currently artistic director of the festival, together with Mitsuko Uchida), Emanuel Ax and Yo-Yo Ma. At the end of each festival season, the traditional closing work was Beethoven's Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, with Rudolf Serkin as soloist and the entire Marlboro community in the chorus.\n\nRuth Laredo graduated in 1960 with a diploma from the Curtis Institute of Music and a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Her graduation took place on a celebration of the fiftieth birthday of the American composer Samuel Barber. By coincidence she had prepared his Sonata in E-flat minor, Op. 26 for her graduation recital, and so became part of the celebration. Barber was in the audience and came back to her after the concert, very warmly congratulated her, and wrote on her copy of the Sonata: “Brava, bravissima.”\n\nAt the Curtis Institute of Music and at the summer music festival of the Meadowmount School of Music in Elizabethtown, New York, Ruth Laredo was chosen by the violin pedagogue Ivan Galamian and the cellist Leonard Rose to be the piano accompanist for their students, among them Arnold Steinhardt, Michael Tree, Pinchas Zukerman and Itzhak Perlman.\n\nRuth Laredo was a member of the faculties of Kent State University (1968-71), Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, and the Manhattan School of Music, New York City. She gave master classes in those institutions and at the Eastman School of Music (University of Rochester), Indiana University Bloomington, the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, and Princeton University. For some time she held the \"Wiley Housewright Eminent Scholar Chair\" at the Florida State University, Tallahassee. Among her students were the American composer and pianist Curt Cacioppo; Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of the New York Times; the Czech pianist Adam Skoumal; and the Swiss pianist Oliver Schnyder.\n\nLaredo served as a jury member for several competitions, among them the \"Young Concert Artists International Auditions\", the \"Naumburg Foundation Competition\", the \"Seventeen Magazine Competition\", the \"New York City Competition\", all New York City, and the \"William Kapell International Piano Competition\", Maryland. As late as 2004 she was a jury member of the \"International Piano-e-Competition\" in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. “We had no idea she was ill,” competition director and pianist Alexander Braginsky told the Minneapolis Star Tribune after Laredo's death. “She was so feisty and opinionated, a powerful personality.”\n\nRuth Laredo appeared on stage as a little girl in the \"Music Club of Metropolitan Detroit\". When she was 11, she gave both her first recital in the Detroit Institute of Arts (among the pieces the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2, where her teacher Edward Bredshall played the orchestral part), and, under Karl Krueger, her first concert with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, with whom she played the second and third movements of the concerto.\n\nShe spent much of the first decade of her career as accompanist to her husband Jaime Laredo. At the same time she tried to establish herself as a soloist and in 1962 she made her orchestral debut in Carnegie Hall with the American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. Unfortunately the debut attracted little attention, and it was some time before she became recognized as a solo performer.\n\nShe was a founding member of the \"Music from Marlboro Concerts\" and in 1965 participated in their first tour, which included a visit to Israel where she played Johann Sebastian Bach's Concerto for three pianos in D minor with Rudolf and Peter Serkin. She appeared in the very first Music from Marlboro Concert, “Isaac Stern and Friends”, in Carnegie Hall in New York City.\n\nHer solo career had a major boost in 1974, when she gave her debut in Avery Fisher Hall at New York's Lincoln Center. Her performance of Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, was met with enthusiastic critical acclaim. In 1976 \"Young Concert Artists\" presented her solo recital debut in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center with pieces of Beethoven, Scriabin, Rachmaninoff and Ravel, whose “La Valse” would become her signature piece. Her encore in this concert was Gershwin's Second Piano Prelude. In 1981 she made her solo recital debut in Carnegie Hall with a program entitled “Homage to Rachmaninoff”, which included works by Chopin, Beethoven and Scriabin.\n\nIn 1988 Laredo participated at the celebration of the 135th anniversary of the first Steinway piano, and the 500,000th piano manufactured by that company. The concert, hosted by Van Cliburn, featured 27 famed pianists, including Alfred Brendel, Shura Cherkassky, Murray Perahia, Rudolf Serkin and Alexis Weissenberg. Laredo played Rachmaninoff's Prelude Op. 32, No. 5 and Coquette from Robert Schumann's Carnaval, Op. 9.\n\nBesides New York City and Detroit, Laredo performed in Washington, D.C. (Kennedy Center, Library of Congress, 1966 in the White House together with her then-husband Jaime Laredo for President Lyndon B. Johnson), in Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Houston, Indianapolis, Maryland, Nashville, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Santa Barbara and Toronto, at numerous festivals, among them the \"Amadeus Festival/Midsummer Nights Festival\" in New Jersey, the \"Aspen Music Festival and School\" in Aspen, Colorado, the \"Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival\" in Bridgehampton, New York, the \"Caramoor International Music Festival\" in Katonah, New York, the \"Eastern Music Festival\" in Greensboro, North Carolina, the \"Maverick Concerts Festival\" in Hurley, New York, the \"Spoleto Festival USA\" in Charleston, South Carolina, the \"Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival\" in Detroit, the \"Music Mountain Summer Chamber Music Festival\" in Falls Village, Connecticut and the \"Casals Festival\" in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She made tours in the season 1976/1977 to Europe (Netherlands, Germany) and Japan, and 1979 to Japan and Hong Kong. Particularly remarkable was her tour in 1989 to Russia (then RSFSR, Moscow, St. Petersburg [then Leningrad]) and the Ukraine (then USSR, Odessa). For an American to come to Russia to play the music of Russian composers – in the same room of the Moscow Conservatory where Rachmaninoff had played – was an extraordinary undertaking. Laredo enjoyed a very warm welcome by the audience and her concerts were sold out. In the Glinka Museum in Moscow she had the opportunity to see Rachmaninoff's original manuscripts.\n\nIn addition to the New York Philharmonic, the Detroit and the American Symphony Orchestra, Ruth Laredo played among others with the Philadelphia, the Cleveland and the American Composers Orchestra, the Baltimore, Beaumont, Boston, Greenwich, Houston, Indianapolis, Jupiter, Madison, National, New Jersey, St. Louis and\nTerre Haute Symphony Orchestra, the Buffalo and the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra under Kazimierz Kord, with whom in 1993 she performed in Warsaw in a \"United Nations Day Concert\", which was broadcast by TV stations all around Europe, and then toured with the orchestra through the US culminating in a concert in Carnegie Hall with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 1.\n\nIn the 1988/1989 season she began her series “Concerts with Commentary” (first called “Speaking of Music”) in the \"Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium\" of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. The series ran for 17 seasons until the last concert on May 6, 2005, shortly before her death. The programs became very popular and therefore she performed them in other cities of the USA.\n\nThe series included works from Brahms, Chopin, Dvořák, Fauré, Franck, Rachmaninoff, Ravel, Clara and Robert Schumann, Scriabin and Tchaikovsky, which she discussed before the performances with great engagement. The final concert was the third of a series entitled “The Russian Spirit” with music from Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Shostakovich.\n\nOn September 13, 2001, only two days after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, Ruth Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her debut in the Alice Tully Hall with a recital as the opening concert of Lincoln Center's 2001 season. Before the concert, she explained to the audience why she had not cancelled the event: “It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.” The program was similar to that of her debut in 1976 and included works by Robert Schumann, Beethoven, Scriabin, Rachmaninoff and Ravel, with Chopin's Waltz Op. 69, No. 1 as the encore.\n\nIn September 2004 Laredo was invited by the Russian ministry of culture to participate in the International Festival of the Rimsky-Korsakov St. Petersburg State Conservatory. At this event, dedicated to the 200th birthday of the Russian composer Mikhail Glinka, she played chamber music as well as solo recitals and gave a master class for Russian students.\n\nShe was noted for her strong commitment to chamber music and said that soloists particularly need this experience as a preparation for concerts with big orchestras. “The lack of it is evident when a soloist performs as if the orchestra were a mere accompaniment,” Laredo said. She collaborated frequently with the Shanghai Quartet (regularly at the Music Mountain Festival), and among others with the American, Budapest, Emerson, Manhattan, Muir, St. Lawrence, St. Petersburg, Veronika and the Vermeer Quartet, with the Chappaqua, Manhattan Chamber, Orpheus Chamber and Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, with the Philharmonia Virtuosi, the Sea Cliff Chamber Players and the Orchestra of St. Luke's. She appeared with the Guarneri Quartet and the Tokyo String Quartet in the Lincoln Center series \"Great Performers\". She helped the Tokyo String Quartet several times when a member of the Quartet was indisposed transforming the group temporarily into a piano quartet. Since their first association in 1980 in Alice Tully Hall, she toured each season with the flutist Paula Robison as the “Paula and Ruth” duo.\n\nRuth Laredo also played contemporary music, mainly in the beginning of her career in Marlboro. This was something Pablo Casals – who did not like music beyond the era of Brahms – disapproved of. He would stay home when Leon Kirchner would come to Marlboro for a performance. In the 1983/1984 season she played the world premiere of Peter Martins's work called \"Waltzes\" with the New York City Ballet. In 1989 she played Wallingford Riegger's twelve-tone \"Variations for Piano and Orchestra\" at Carnegie Hall with the American Composers Orchestra under Paul Lustig Dunkel. Her repertoire included also works by Franz Liszt, Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, Anton Webern and Alban Berg.\n\nIn 1994 Laredo played with jazz pianist Marian McPartland and from 1996 with her and Dick Hyman in programs entitled \"Three Piano Crossover\".\n\nIn the last years of her life, her career as a soloist with orchestras waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals and chamber concerts.\n\nLaredo criticized the rising trend in the US of recording live concerts for broadcast as “troublesome”. She preferred the European method of recording the music in radio studios for subsequent broadcast.\n\nIn 1967 Ruth Laredo recorded a well-received album of piano music by French composer Maurice Ravel, also renowned for music full of pianistic challenges.\n\nIn 1970 Laredo made her famous premiere recordings of Scriabin's 10 sonatas on three LPs for \"Connoisseur Society\" (reissued in 1984 by Nonesuch Records on a three-LP box and in 1996 on a double CD). She made the recordings in St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University, New York City, on a Baldwin SD-10 grand piano. The Scriabin LPs were released in a period where little of Scriabin's music was available, and Laredo's recordings led to his rising popularity in the USA. \"I was kind of a crusader for his music,\" said Laredo.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1981 followed Rachmaninoff's complete solo piano works on seven LPs for CBS Masterworks (reissued in 1993 by Sony Classical on five CDs), a project no pianist before had ever dared to undertake (at the same time the German-American pianist Michael Ponti also recorded the Scriabin and Rachmaninoff works). At this time she was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others – Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example. The New York Daily News baptised her now “America's First Lady of the Piano”, an appellation which was later used by many others. Laredo initially disliked this as she felt it was sexist: she wanted to be known as a pianist, not a “woman pianist” Later she relented and used the title herself in her book and on her website.\n\nThe preparations for the recording of Rachmaninoff's solo piano works proved to be very exhausting. Laredo said she now understood why some of the pieces had never been played by anybody: it was simply because they were so hard. Rachmaninoff, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall with correspondingly large hands, had composed many of his works for himself. One could only wonder how the tiny 5-foot-1-inch Laredo was able to play Rachmaninoff's pieces, some of which indulged in 11-key stretches. After practicing the music of “Rocky”, as she called Rachmaninoff, she had to get her hands massaged.\n\nRuth Laredo also recorded more than 20 albums featuring works of other composers, among them Isaac Albéniz, Bach, Beethoven, Lili Boulanger, Brahms, Chopin, Falla, Debussy, Khachaturian, Fauré, Mozart, Poulenc, Ravel, Clara and Robert Schumann, Tchaikovsky as well as of the American composers Barber, Aaron Copland, Ives, Laderman, Kirchner, Rorem and Siegmeister. Especially acclaimed was the recording with James Tocco of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" in the version for two pianos for Gasparo Records.\n\nLaredo made her last recordings in 1999 with the Shanghai Quartet, who called her “the fifth member of the Shanghai Quartet” for Arabesque Records (piano quartets by Brahms) and at the Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival with the violinist Philip Setzer for Newport Classic (“Day Music” by Ned Rorem; the CD contains also Norem's “War Scenes” and “End of Summer” performed by other artists, including the composer at the piano). Both CDs were released in 2000.\n\nProbably the last radio program was the one with jazz pianist Marian McPartland for NPR. The date was February 19, 2004.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is used in flavoring and it masks the bitter taste of drugs like aloe and quinine. It is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer and also has expectorant (antitussive) properties. It has some additional pharmacological properties with possible antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antibacterial activities.\n\nGlycyrrhetinic acid inhibits the enzymes (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and delta-13-prostaglandin) that metabolize the prostaglandins PGE-2 and PGF-2α to their respective 15-keto-13,14-dihydro metabolites which are inactive. This causes an increased level of prostaglandins in the digestive system. Prostaglandins inhibit gastric secretion but stimulate pancreatic secretion and mucous secretion in the intestines and markedly increase intestinal motility. They also cause cell proliferation in the stomach. The effect on gastric acid secretion, promotion of mucous secretion and cell proliferation shows why licorice has potential in treating peptic ulcer.\n\nPGF-2α stimulates activity of the uterus during pregnancy and can cause abortion, therefore, licorice should not be taken during pregnancy.\n\nThe structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of cortisone. Both molecules are flat and similar at position 3 and 11. This might be the basis for licorice's anti-inflammatory action.\n\n3-β--(Monoglucuronyl)-18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibits the conversion of 'active' cortisol to 'inactive' cortisone in the kidneys. This occurs via inhibition of the enzyme 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. As a result, cortisol levels are high within the collecting duct of the kidney. Cortisol has intrinsic mineralocorticoid properties (that is, it acts like aldosterone and increases sodium reabsorption) that work on ENaC channels in the collecting duct. Hypertension develops due to this mechanism of sodium retention. People often have high blood pressure with a low renin and low aldosterone blood level. The increased amounts of cortisol binds to the unprotected, unspecific mineralocorticoid receptors and induce sodium and fluid retention, hypokalaemia, high blood pressure and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, licorice should not be given to patients with a known history of hypertension in doses sufficient to inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.\n\nIn glycyrrhetinic acid, the functional group (R) is a hydroxyl group. Research in 2005 demonstrated that with a proper functional group a very effective glycyrrhetinic artificial sweetener can be obtained. When R is an anionic NHCO(CH)COK side chain, the sweetening effect is found to 1200 times that of sugar (human sensory panel data). A shorter or longer spacer reduces the sweetening effect. One explanation is that the taste bud cell receptor has 1.3 nanometers (13 angstroms) available for docking with the sweetener molecule. In addition the sweetener molecule requires three proton donor positions of which two reside at the extremities to be able to interact efficiently with the receptor cavity.\n\nA synthetic analog, carbenoxolone, was developed in Britain. Both glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone have a modulatory effect on neural signaling through gap junction channels.\n\nAcetoxolone, the acetyl derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\n\n"}

The Handy Colony was founded in 1950 by Lowney Turner Handy and her husband, Harry Handy, along with Lowney's student (and then-lover), best-selling novelist James Jones. Lowney Handy was the Colony's quirky teacher and mentor, with financial support coming from her husband and Jones, particularly after the sale of Jones' first novel, \"From Here to Eternity\". A unique aspect of Handy's approach was to have her students spend many hours simply copying, by hand or typewriter, materials from authors whose work she admired.\n\nOriginally conceived as a Utopian commune where budding artists could focus exclusively on their writing projects, the colony dissolved largely in part because of Handy's own erratic behavior and Jones' focus on his own novels.\n\nMany young writers found support at the Colony. Published writers associated with the Colony included James Jones, John Bowers, Tom T. Chamales, Edwin C. Daly, William Duhart, Jere Peacock, Jon Shirota, Jerry Tschappat (a.k.a.

Secretly Canadian is a label included in Secretly Group, which also includes Dead Oceans and Jagjaguwar. Secretly Group includes the three record labels as well as a music publisher known as Secretly Publishing, representing artists, writers, film makers, producers, and comedians.\n\nSecretly Canadian was founded in 1996 by Chris and Ben Swanson, Eric Weddle, and Jonathan Cargill while they attended Indiana University. The Swanson brothers, originally from Fargo, North Dakota, decided to move to Bloomington after a Billboard article painted the Midwestern college town's scene as the next Seattle and an incubator for up-and-coming bands.\n\nBefore Secretly Canadian was founded, Chris Swanson and Eric Weddle met in 1995 as sophomores involved in Indiana University's campus radio station, WIUX. Then Chris met Jonathan Cargill through a job at the Collins Living-Learning Center cafeteria on campus. Soon after, Chris' younger brother Ben Swanson moved to Bloomington to earn his undergraduate degree from the Jacobs School of Music in ethnomusicology.\n\nIn 1996, Secretly Canadian was founded out of the Swanson's house. They had little experience and spent months researching how to make a CD.\n\nThe label's first official release was a re-issue of an album by June Panic from Grand Forks, North Dakota; the Glory Hole CD. The second release in 1997 was Jason Molina's, under the moniker, After the Swanson brothers tracked down Molina's email address and drove hours to Molina's in-store gig at Adult Crash in New York. After signing Molina, the record label became more popular in the indie music scene.\n\nSecretly Canadian then signed other notable early releases, including Marmoset and Swearing At Motorists.\n\nWeddle soon left to form label Family Vineyard – and later followed by Cargill as well. After that, Chris Swanson and Darius Van Arman became friends in 1999 and Secretly Canadian joined forces with Van Arman's Jagjaguwar.\n\nThe early 2000s yielded reissues from Swell Maps, Nikki Sudden, and Danielson. Damien Jurado, the Seattle singer-songwriter, made his way to Secretly Canadian in 2002. Two years later, Jens Lekman joined the label's roster.\n\nAnohni also signed to the label in the 2000s. Formerly known as Antony and the Johnsons earlier in her career, the Swanson brothers became enamored with Antony and the Johnsons’ self-titled debut from 2000. Antony and the Johnsons’ first record with Secretly Canadian, I Am a Bird Now, released in 2005, sold 100,000 copies in the first two months. \n\nSecretly Canadian then signed The War on Drugs, the Philadelphia-based band whose third record, Lost in the Dream, struck as both a critical and commercial success in 2014. Secretly Canadian also began a partnership with Chimera Records in the form of Yoko Ono's reissues beginning in 2016, and the debut release from William Eggleston, in 2017. Secretly Canadian's roster also includes Cherry Glazerr, Whitney, Alex Cameron, Joey Dosik, Stella Donnelly, Faye Webster, and serpentwithfeet, among many others. \n\nIn 2007, the addition of Dead Oceans to Secretly Canadian and Jagjaguwar's partnership led to the formation of Secretly Group. In 2015, Secretly Group began a partnership with The Numero Group as well.\n\nIn 2018, Secretly Canadian was listed as #8 on Paste Magazine's top 10 record labels of 2018. Jagjaguwar was listed as #4 and Dead Oceans was listed as #7.\n\nGRAMMY AWARDS (US/GLOBAL)\n\nEMMYS / TELEVISION ACADEMY (US/GLOBAL)\n\nA2IM LIBERA AWARDS (US)\n\nMERCURY PRIZE (UK)\n\nBRIT AWARDS (UK/GLOBAL)\n\nAIM INDEPENDENT MUSIC AWARDS (UK)\n\nNME AWARDS (UK)\n\nARIA AWARDS (AUSTRALIA)\n\nNEW ZEALAND MUSIC AWARDS (NZ)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951124", "title": "Liturgy of the Hours", "text": "Liturgy of the Hours\n\nThe Liturgy of the Hours (Latin: \"Liturgia Horarum\") or Divine Office (Latin: \"Officium Divinum\") or Work of God (Latin: \"Opus Dei\") or canonical hours, often referred to as the Breviary, is the official set of prayers \"marking the hours of each day and sanctifying the day with prayer\". It consists primarily of psalms supplemented by hymns, readings and other prayers and antiphons. Together with the Mass, it constitutes the official public prayer life of the Church. The Liturgy of the Hours also forms the basis of prayer within Christian monasticism.\n\nCelebration of the Liturgy of the Hours is an obligation undertaken by priests and deacons intending to become priests, while deacons intending to remain deacons are obliged to recite only a part. The constitutions of religious institutes generally oblige their members to celebrate at least parts and in some cases to do so jointly (\"in choir\"). The laity are under no public obligation to do so, but may oblige themselves to do so by personal vow, and \"are encouraged to recite the divine office, either with the priests, or among themselves, or even individually\".\n\nThe Liturgy of the Hours, along with the Eucharist, has formed part of the Church's public worship from the earliest times. Christians of both Western and Eastern traditions (including the Latin Catholic, Eastern Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Anglican, Lutheran, and some other Protestant churches) celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours in various forms and under various names.\n\nWithin the Latin Church, the present official form of the entire Liturgy of the Hours is that contained in the four-volume publication \"Liturgia Horarum\", the first edition of which appeared in 1971. English translations were soon produced and were made official for their territories by the competent episcopal conferences. The three-volume \"Divine Office\", which uses a range of different English Bibles for the readings from Scripture, was published in 1974; the four-volume \"Liturgy of the Hours\", with Scripture readings from the \"New American Bible\", appeared in 1975. Before 1971, the official form for the Latin Church was the \"Breviarium Romanum\", first published in 1568.\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite, the corresponding services are found in the (Horologion), meaning \"Book of Hours\". Anglican Liturgy of the Hours is contained in the book of Daily Prayer of Common Worship and the Book of Common Prayer, as well as in the Anglican Breviary. The Lutheran counterpart is contained in the liturgical books used by the various Lutheran church bodies.\n\nOther names in Latin liturgical rites for the Liturgy of the Hours include \"Diurnal and Nocturnal Office\", \"Ecclesiastical Office\", \"Cursus ecclesiasticus\", or simply \"cursus\".\n\nThe General Instruction of the Liturgy of Hours in the Roman Rite states: \"The public and communal prayer of the people of God is rightly considered among the first duties of the Church. From the very beginning the baptized 'remained faithful to the teaching of the apostles, to the brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and to the prayers' (Acts 2 :42). Many times the Acts of the Apostles testifies that the Christian community prayed together. The testimony of the early Church shows that individual faithful also devoted themselves to prayer at certain hours. In various areas the practice soon gained ground of devoting special times to prayer in common.\"\n\nEarly Christians were in fact continuing the Jewish practice of reciting prayers at certain hours of the day or night. In the Psalms are found expressions like \"in the morning I offer you my prayer\"; \"At midnight I will rise and thank you\"; \"Evening, morning and at noon I will cry and lament\"; \"Seven times a day I praise you\". The Apostles observed the Jewish custom of praying at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, and at midnight (Acts 10:3, 9; 16:25; etc.).\n\nThe Christian prayer of that time consisted of almost the same elements as the Jewish: recital or chanting of psalms, reading of the Old Testament, to which were soon added readings of the Gospels, Acts, and epistles, and canticles. Other elements were added later in the course of the centuries.\n\nBy the time of Saint Benedict of Nursia, the monastic Liturgy of the Hours was composed of seven daytime hours and one at night. He associated the practice with Psalm 118/119:164, \"Seven times a day I praise you\", and Psalm 118/119:62, \"At midnight I rise to praise you\". Of these eight hours, Prime and Compline may be the latest to appear, because the 4th-century Apostolic Constitutions VIII iv 34 do not mention them in the exhortation \"Offer up your prayers in the morning, at the third hour, the sixth, the ninth, the evening, and at cock-crowing\". The eight are known by the following names, which do not reflect the times of day at which in the second millennium they have traditionally been recited, as shown by the use of the word \"noon\", derived from Latin \"(hora) nona\", to mean midday, not 3 in the afternoon:\n\n\nThis arrangement of the Liturgy of the Hours is described by Saint Benedict. However, it is found in Saint John Cassian's \"Institutes\" and \"Conferences\", which describe the monastic practices of the Desert Fathers of Egypt.\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, which decided that the hour of prime should be suppressed, Pope Paul VI decreed a new arrangement of the Liturgy of the Hours. The structure of the offices, the distribution of psalms, and the prayers were updated. The distinction, already expressed in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, between the three major hours (Matins, Lauds and Vespers) and the minor hours (Terce, Sext, None and Compline) has been retained.\n\n\nAll hours, including the minor hours, start with the versicle from Ps 70 (69) v. 2 (as do all offices in the traditional breviary except Matins and Compline): \"V. Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. R. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina\" (\"God, come to my assistance; Lord, make haste to help me\"), followed by the doxology. The verse is omitted if the hour begins with the Invitatory (Morning Prayer/Lauds or the Office of Reading). The Invitatory is the introduction to the first hour said on the current day, whether it be the Office of Readings or Morning Prayer.\n\nThe opening is followed by a hymn. The hymn is followed by psalmody. The psalmody is followed by a scripture reading. The reading is called a chapter (\"capitulum\") if it is short, or a lesson (\"lectio\") if it is long.\n\nThe reading is followed by a versicle. The hour is closed by an oration followed by a concluding versicle. Other components are included depending on the exact type of hour being celebrated. In each office, the psalms and canticle are framed by antiphons, and each concludes with the traditional Catholic doxology.\n\nThe major hours are the Office of Readings, Morning (or Lauds) and Evening Prayer (or Vespers).\n\nThe Office of Readings consists of:\n\n\nThe character of Morning Prayer is that of praise; of Evening Prayer, that of thanksgiving. Both follow a similar format:\n\n\nThe daytime hours follow a simpler format, like a very compact form of the Office of Readings:\n\n\nNight prayer (Compline) has the character of preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life:\n\n\nIn addition to the distribution of almost the whole Psalter over a four-week cycle, the Church also provides appropriate hymns, readings, psalms, canticles and antiphons, for use in marking specific celebrations in the Roman Calendar, which sets out the order for the liturgical year. These selections are found in the 'Proper of Seasons' (for Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter), and the 'Proper of Saints' (for feast days of the Saints).\n\nAn Invitatory precedes the canonical hours of the day beginning with the versicle \"Lord, open my lips. And my mouth will proclaim your praise\" (Ps 50/51 v.17), and continuing with an antiphon and the Invitatory Psalm, usually Psalm 94/95.\n\nAll psalms and canticles are accompanied by antiphons.\n\nUnless the Invitatory is used, each Hour begins with the versicle \"God, come to my assistance. Lord, make haste to help me\" (Ps 69/70 v.2), followed by a hymn. Each Hour concludes with a prayer followed by a short versicle and response.\n\nMatins or the Office of Readings is the longest hour. Before Pope Pius X's reform, it involved the recitation of 18 psalms on Sundays and 12 on ferial days. Pope Pius X reduced this to 9 psalms or portions of psalms, still arranged in three \"nocturns\", each set of three psalms followed by three short readings, usually three consecutive sections from the same text. Pope Paul VI's reform reduced the number of psalms or portions of psalms to three, and the readings to two, but lengthened these. On feast days the Te Deum is sung or recited before the concluding prayer.\n\nAfter St. Pius X's reform, Lauds was reduced to four psalms or portions of psalms and an Old Testament canticle, putting an end to the custom of adding the last three psalms of the Psalter (148–150) at the end of Lauds every day. The number of psalms or portions of psalms is now reduced to two, together with one Old Testament canticle chosen from a wider range than before. After these there is a short reading and response and the singing or recitation of the \"Benedictus\".\n\nVespers has a very similar structure, differing in that Pius X assigned to it five psalms (now reduced to 2 psalms and a New Testament canticle) and the \"Magnificat\" took the place of the \"Benedictus\". On some days in Pius X's arrangement, but now always, there follow \"Preces\" or intercessions. In the present arrangement, the Lord's Prayer is also recited before the concluding prayer.\n\nTerce, Sext and None have an identical structure, each with three psalms or portions of psalms. These are followed by a short reading from Scripture, once referred to as a \"little chapter\" (capitulum), and by a versicle and response. The Lesser Litany (Kyrie and the Lord's Prayer) of Pius X's arrangement have now been omitted.\n\nPrime and Compline also were of similar structure, though different from Terce, Sext and None.\n\nIn monasteries and cathedrals, celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours became more elaborate. Served by monks or canons, regular celebration required a Psalter for the psalms, a lectionary for the Scripture readings, other books for patristic and hagiographical readings, a collectary for the orations, and also books such as the antiphonary and the responsoriary for the various chants. These were usually of large size, to enable several monks to chant together from the same book. Smaller books called breviaries (a word that etymologically refers to a compendium or abridgment) were developed to indicate the format of the daily office and assist in identifying the texts to be chosen.\n\nThese developed into books that gave in abbreviated form (because they omitted the chants) and in small lettering the whole of the texts, and so could be carried when travelling. Pope Innocent III made them official in the Roman Curia, and the itinerant Franciscan friars adopted the \"Breviarium Curiae\" and soon spread its use throughout Europe. By the 14th century, these breviaries contained the entire text of the canonical hours. The invention of printing made it possible to produce them in great numbers.\n\nIn its final session, the Council of Trent entrusted to the Pope the revision of the breviary. With his Apostolic Constitution \"Quod a nobis\" of 9 July 1568, Pope Pius V promulgated an edition of the breviary, known as the Roman Breviary, which he imposed in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his Roman Missal. Using language very similar to that in the bull \"Quo primum\", with which he promulgated the Missal – regarding, for instance, the perpetual force of its provisions – he made it obligatory to use the promulgated text everywhere.\n\nHe totally prohibited adding or omitting anything: \"No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult declaration, will decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.\"\n\nIt is obvious that he did not thereby intend to bind his successors. Pope Clement VIII made changes that he made obligatory on 10 May 1602, 34 years after Pius V's revision. Urban VIII made further changes, including \"a profound alteration in the character of some of the hymns. Although some of them without doubt gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also lost something of their old charm of simplicity and fervour.\" For the profound revision of the book by Pope Pius X see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X.\n\nFinally, a new revision was made by Pope Paul VI with his Apostolic Constitution \"Laudis Canticum\" of 1 November 1970. \n\nMany of the complicated rubrics (or instructions) that governed recitation of the Liturgy were clarified, and the actual method of praying the office was made simpler. Prime had already been abolished by the Second Vatican Council. Of the three intermediate Hours of Terce, Sext and None, only one was to be of strict obligation. Recitation of the psalms and a much increased number of canticles was spread over four weeks instead of one. By a personal decision of Pope Paul VI against the majority view of the revising commission, three imprecatory psalms (58, 83, and 109) were omitted from the psalter and some similar verses were omitted from other psalms, as indicated in the heading of each. These omissions, lamented by Joseph Briody, are attributed in the General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours to \"certain psychological difficulties, even though the imprecatory psalms themselves may be found quoted in the New Testament, e.g. , and in no way are intended to be used as curses\".\n\nTwo typical editions of the revised Liturgy of the Hours (\"Liturgia Horarum\") according to the Roman Rite have been published by Rome. The current typical edition is the \"Liturgia Horarum, editio typica altera\", promulgated in 1985 (printed between 1985 and 1987, and reprinted in 2000). This uses the Nova Vulgata Latin Bible for the readings, psalms and canticles rather than the Clementina.\n\nIt has changed the text of some of the readings and responsories in line with the Nova Vulgata, and it provides the Benedictus and Magnificat on each Sunday with three antiphons that reflect the three-year cycle of Gospel readings. Pope Urban VIII's lamented alterations of the hymns are undone. Verse numberings are added to the Psalms and the longer Scripture readings, while the Psalms are given both the Septuagint numbering and (in parentheses) that of the Masoretic text. New texts, taken from the \"Missale Romanum\", have been added in an appendix for solemn blessings and the penitential acts.\n\nThus far, this second Latin typical edition has only been translated in the \"Liturgy of the Hours for Africa\" The earlier edition has appeared in two English translations, one under the title \"Liturgy of the Hours\", the other as \"The Divine Office\".\n\nIn the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, bishops, priests, and deacons planning to become priests are obliged to recite the full sequence of the hours each day, observing as closely as possible the associated times of day, and using the text of the approved liturgical books that apply to them. Permanent deacons are to do so to the extent determined by their Episcopal Conference. Members of institutes of consecrated life, societies of apostolic life, or other religious associations (e.g., Benedictine oblates, Third Order Dominicans) who are not clerics and are therefore not subject to these obligations are bound according to the norm of their constitutions. Members of such institutes and societies who are deacons, priests, or bishops, remain bound to their more severe obligation as clergy.\n\nLatin Church clerics can lawfully fulfill their obligation to pray the Office using the edition of the Roman Breviary promulgated by John XXIII in 1961 rather than the current edition of the Liturgy of the Hours. While the 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" states that communities belonging to institutes of religious life and societies of apostolic life require authorization only by their major superiors to use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal for their conventual or community Mass frequently, habitually or permanently; it makes no such statement regarding use of the 1962 Liturgy of the Hours, which however could be allowed by their constitutions.\n\nLaity, especially if they are involved in ministries of the Church (lector, cantor, extraordinary minister of Holy Communion, catechists, religious education directors or school principals, altar servers, those contemplating religious life or the seminary), are strongly encouraged to participate.\n\nThe constitutions of some institutes of consecrated life, in particular many congregations of Benedictine monks and nuns, but also others, oblige them to follow an arrangement of the Psalter whereby all the psalms are recited in the course of a single week, partly through an extension of the Office of Readings, and by maintaining the Hour of Prime.\n\nThe canonical hours stemmed from Jewish prayer. This \"sacrifice of praise\" began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals.\n\nIn Roman cities, the bell in the forum rang the beginning of the business day at about six o'clock in the morning (Prime, the \"first hour\"), noted the day's progress by striking again at about nine o'clock in the morning (Terce, the \"third hour\"), tolled for the lunch break at noon (Sext, the \"sixth hour\"), called the people back to work again at about three o'clock in the afternoon (None, the \"ninth hour\"), and rang the close of the business day at about six o'clock in the evening (the time for evening prayer).\n\nThe healing of the crippled man at the temple gate, occurred as Peter and John were going to the Temple to pray () at the \"ninth hour\" of prayer (about three pm). The decision to include Gentiles among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying at noontime, () the \"sixth hour\".\n\nThe early church was known to pray the Psalms (), which have remained a part of the canonical hours. By 60 AD, the Didache recommended disciples to pray the Lord's Prayer three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. Pliny the Younger (63 – c. 113), mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services—other than the Eucharist—assigned to those times: \"they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.\"\n\nBy the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at terce, sext, and none. The prayers could be prayed individually or in groups. By the third century, the Desert Fathers began to live out St. Paul's command to \"pray without ceasing\" () by having one group of monks pray one fixed-hour prayer while having another group pray the next prayer.\n\nAs the format of unbroken fixed-hour prayer developed in the Christian monastic communities in the East and West, longer prayers soon grew, but the cycle of prayer became the norm in daily life in monasteries. By the fourth century, the characteristics of the canonical hours more or less took their present shape. For secular (non-monastic) clergymen and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter. In many churches and basilicas staffed by monks, the form of the fixed-hour prayers was a hybrid of secular and monastic practice.\n\nIn the East, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to Constantinople. In particular, St. Theodore the Studite (c. 758 – c. 826) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in Asia Minor, and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see Typicon for further details).\n\nIn the West, St. Benedict in his famous Rule modeled his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the basilicas of Rome. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. The Benedictines began to call the prayers the \"Opus Dei\" or \"Work of God.\"\n\nAs the Divine Office grew more important in the life of the Church, the rituals became more elaborate. Soon, praying the Office began to require various books, such as a psalter for the psalms, a lectionary to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a Bible to proclaim the reading, a hymnal for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from cathedrals and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the Breviary, which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used.\n\nThe spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where Pope Innocent III extended its use to the Roman Curia. The Franciscans sought a one-volume breviary for its friars to use during travels, so the order adopted the \"Breviarium Curiae\", but substituting the Gallican Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Pope Nicholas III would then adopt the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.\n\nThe Council of Trent, in its final session on 4 December 1563 entrusted the reform of the breviary to the then pope, Pius IV. On 9 July 1568, Pope Pius V, the successor to Pius IV who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the Roman Breviary, with his Apostolic Constitution \"Quod a nobis\", imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his Roman Missal and using language very similar to that in the bull \"Quo primum\" with which he promulgated the Missal, regarding, for instance, the perpetual force of its provisions, the obligation to use the promulgated text in all places, and the total prohibition of adding or omitting anything, declaring in fact: \"No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult declaration, will decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.\"\n\nWith the same bull, Pius V ordered the general abolition of all breviaries other than his reformed breviary, with the same exception that he was to make in his \"Quo primum\" bull: he allowed those legitimately in use for at least 200 years to continue. Examples of such breviaries are the Benedictine (\"Breviarium Monasticum\"), the Carmelite, the Carthusian, the Dominican, the Premonstratensian, and the Ambrosian.\n\nSt. Mark's Basilica in Venice, along with the four churches under its jurisdiction, retained its own unique liturgies, psalm cursi, and Latin translations into the 19th century. Many other churches whose local rites predated Pius V's breviary by 200 years or more, such as that of Mantua, continued to use their own breviaries, liturgical calendars, and psalm cursi, as well.\n\nLater popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. Pope Clement VIII instituted obligatory changes on 10 May 1602, 34 years after Pius V's revision. Pope Urban VIII made further changes, including \"a profound alteration in the character of some of the hymns. Although some of them without doubt gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also lost something of their old charm of simplicity and fervour.\"\n\nPope Pius X made a radical revision of the Roman Breviary, to be put into effect, at latest, on 1 January 1913. See Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X.\n\nPope Pius XII allowed the use of a new translation of the Psalms from the Hebrew and established a special commission to study a general revision, concerning which all the Catholic bishops were consulted in 1955. His successor, Pope John XXIII, implemented these revisions in 1960.\n\nFollowing the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church's Latin Church, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church, revised the liturgical book for the celebration of the Divine Office, and published it under the title \"Liturgy of the Hours\".\n\nThe Council itself abolished the office of Prime, and envisioned a manner of distributing the psalms over a period of more than 1 week. In the succeeding revision, the character of Matins was changed to an Office of Readings so that it could be used at any time of the day as an office of Scriptural and patristic readings. Furthermore, the period over which the Psalter is recited has been expanded from one week to four. The Latin hymns of the Roman Office were in many cases restored to the pre-Urban form, albeit several of them were shortened.\n\nThis new \"Liturgy of the Hours\" (\"Liturgia Horarum\" in Latin) is published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in four volumes, arranged according to the liturgical seasons of the Church year.\nThe current liturgical books for the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours in Latin are those of the \" editio typica altera\" (second typical edition) promulgated in 1985 and re-issued, by the Vatican Publishing House – Libreria Editrice Vaticana, in 2000 and 2003.\n\nMidwest Theological Forum has published an edition \"iuxta typicam\" with updating of the celebration of saints. It is arranged in six volumes:\n\nAlthough most priests and other clerics in the Latin Church now use the new Liturgy of the Hours, some (such as those in the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter or similar societies) continue to use the Breviary as revised by Pope Pius X, the latest edition of which was issued under Pope John XXIII. The \"motu proprio\" Summorum Pontificum in 2007 authorized every Latin Church cleric to use this edition to fulfill his canonical obligation to pray the Divine Office. An English/Latin parallel edition was published by Baronius Press in April 2012.\n\nThree English translations are in use.\n\n\"The Divine Office\" was produced by a commission set up by the Episcopal Conferences of Australia, England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland. First published in 1974 by HarperCollins, this edition is the official English edition for use in the dioceses of the above countries as well as many other dioceses around the world, especially in Asian and African countries. It is arranged in three volumes:\n\nThe psalms are taken (with slight adaptations) from the 1963 Grail Psalms, while the Scripture readings and non-Gospel canticles are taken from various versions of the Bible, including the Revised Standard Version, the Jerusalem Bible, the Good News Bible, the New English Bible and Ronald Knox's Translation of the Vulgate. Some of the canticles taken from the Revised Standard Version were amended slightly to conform the English text to the Vulgate in \"The Divine Office\". The intercessions, concluding prayers, antiphons, short responses, responsories, second readings in the Office of Readings, Te Deum and Glory be to the Father are all translations approved by the Episcopal Conferences mentioned and confirmed by the Holy See in December 1973. The Gospel canticles (Benedictus, Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis) are from the 1963 Grail Translation, but an appendix at the end of the book gives the English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC)) versions of the Gospel canticles as alternatives.\n\nCollins also publishes shorter editions of \"The Divine Office\":\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Collins republished \"The Divine Office\" and its various shorter editions with a new cover and revised Calendar of the Moveable Feasts.\n\nBesides these shorter editions of \"The Divine Office\", there used to be \"A Shorter Prayer During the Day\" comprising the Psalter for the Middle Hours also published by Collins. The last known reprint year is 1986, but this edition is now out of print. In 2009, \"Prayer during the day\" was published by Catholic Truth Society.\n\nThe \"Liturgy of the Hours\", produced by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, was first published in 1975 by Catholic Book Publishing Company in the USA. This edition is the official English edition for use in the US, Canada and some other English-speaking dioceses. It is in four volumes, an arrangement identical to the original Latin typical edition.\n\nThe psalms are taken (slightly adapted) from the 1963 Grail Psalms, while the Scripture readings and non-Gospel canticles are taken from the original 1970 first edition New American Bible. The prayers and intercessions are translated by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL). The ELLC versions are used for items such as the Gospel canticles. An additional feature are psalm-prayers at the end of many Psalms, which were ICEL's translation of the Liber Orationum Psalmographus, the Book of Psalm-Prayers which originated in the Mozarabic Rite.\n\nShorter editions of the \"Liturgy of the Hours\" are also available from various publishers: \"Christian Prayer\" (Daughters of St Paul and Catholic Book Publishing Company), \"Shorter Christian Prayer\" (Catholic Book Publishing Company) and \"Daytime Prayer\" (Catholic Book Publishing Company). In 2007, Liturgy Training Publications released the \"Mundelein Psalter\", containing Morning, Evening and Night Prayers and the Office for the Dead, with the 1963 Grail translation of the Psalms set to specially composed chant, and with hymns translated from the hymns of the Latin \"Liturgia Horarum\".\n\nThe \"Divine Office\" and the \"Liturgy of the Hours\" editions are both based on the Latin 1971 editio typica.\n\nIn 2009, on the occasion of the Synod of African Bishops in Rome, the Catholic Church in Africa, through Paulines Publications Africa, published a new English edition of the Liturgy of the Hours based on the \"Liturgia Horarum, editio typica altera\". The antiphons and orations in this edition are taken from ICEL's 1975 translation of the Liturgy of the Hours, with independent translations for the offices for the new saints added to the General Roman Calendar as well as the Benedictus and Magnificat antiphons for the 3-year cycle on Sundays added in the \"Liturgia Horarum, editio typica altera\".\n\nThe Psalms are taken from the Revised Grail Psalter with the rest of the biblical texts taken from the New American Bible. To-date, this is the only official English edition of the Office that is based on the \"Liturgia Horarum, editio typica altera\".\n\nFollowing the establishment of the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans in the 2009 apostolic constitution \"Anglicanorum coetibus\", work on a form of the Office that reflects Anglican tradition. In the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in England and Wales, the \"Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham\" was adopted.\n\n\n"}

The episode launched a change of direction for the series, starting with a cataclysmic attack on the Star Trek version of Earth and introducing a new alien foe, the Xindi.\n\nThis episode set the foundation for the season-spanning Xindi story arc, encompassing all of and the first three episodes of . As such, the story line continues in the Season Three opening episode, \"The Xindi\".\n\nIn April 2153, an unknown alien probe attacks Earth, cutting a destructive swath 4,000 km long, from Florida to Venezuela, and killing millions. Shortly after, \"Enterprise\" is recalled to Earth by Admiral Forrest. On the way back, Captain Archer is kidnapped by the Suliban Cabal. He accuses the Suliban leader, Silik, of being responsible for the Earth attack, but Silik professes ignorance. The Cabal's sponsor, a vague and shadowy holographic human from the distant future, gives Archer information about the Temporal Cold War and the Xindi, the race that attacked Earth. He claims the Xindi have been told by another Cold War faction that their home-world will be destroyed, in 400 years, by Humans.\n\n\"Enterprise\" is again ambushed and comes under heavy attack as she arrives just outside Earth's solar system, this time by a Klingon Bird of Prey commanded by Captain Duras at the behest of the Klingon High Council. Fortunately, three other Starfleet vessels quickly arrive, forcing it to retreat. The crew then learn that more than 7 million people have been killed, one of them being Commander Tucker's younger sister, Elizabeth. Archer relates his encounters to Starfleet and the Vulcan High Command, and it is clear that the Xindi of the present are pre-empting the destruction of their home-world in the future. Ambassador Soval is dubious of Archer's temporal war argument, and tries to dissuade him from venturing into the Delphic Expanse, a dangerous section of space that once destroyed the Vulcan ship \"Vaankara\".\n\nArcher, acting on advice from the shadowy informant, scans the crashed probe, revealing a component with an unmistakable date stamp placing the date of construction at 420 years in the future. Starfleet orders Archer to take \"Enterprise\" to the Expanse to try to stop the Xindi. At the same time, Starfleet begins refitting the \"Enterprise\" with improved weapons, shields, and a detachment of MACOs (Military Assault Command Operations soldiers) are stationed aboard for the mission. \n\nAmbassador Soval informs T'Pol that her assignment on \"Enterprise\" has been terminated by the High Command, who deem this to be purely a human matter, However T'Pol refuses to abandon her crew and friends when they are heading deep into the unknown. On their journey towards the Expanse, intending to stop by Vulcan to return T'Pol, she reveals to Archer that rather than be forced back to Vulcan, she has resigned from the Vulcan High Command, and wishes to remain on board, a suggestion welcomed by Archer.\n\nAfter a three-month journey, \"Enterprise\" begins to enter the Expanse when they are again attacked by Duras, who is at risk of losing everything if he fails. Tired of being dogged by him, Archer decides to test \"Enterprise's\" new upgrades. Duras' ship is destroyed by Archer, and \"Enterprise\" begins its mission.\n\nCommander Tucker's younger sister, Elizabeth, was killed in Florida by the Xindi along with 7 million other Humans in the year 2153. The CGI depiction of the attack on Earth shows the beam hitting Florida in Moore Haven and cutting directly south, through the Big Cypress Indian Reservation in Hendry County, to Cuba, until reaching South America.\n\nA novelized adaptation of the episode by J.M. Dillard was published as \"The Expanse\" by Pocket Books in trade paperback format in October 2003. The novel also adapted the following episode, \"The Xindi\". These two episodes stand as the final televised \"Star Trek\" episodes to be novelized to date.\n\nThis episode was nominated for the 2003 Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series.\n\nIn 2016, \"Radio Times\" ranked the Xindi attack on Earth, the 45th greatest scene of all \"Star Trek\" film and television productions. They note the event re-energized the show and launched a season long story arc. They note, \"Then came a cliffhanger episode that began with a devastating sight: an alien probe cutting a swathe of destruction across Earth.\"\n\n\n"}

He played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball with the Houston Astros.\n\nWilson's professional career began after he graduated from Compton Community College in Compton, California and was recruited by the Astros in 1966, where he played until 1974. Especially early in his career when he was prone to wildness, Wilson was known as one of the hardest throwers in the National League.\n\nOn June 18, 1967, Wilson no-hit the Atlanta Braves 2–0 at the Astrodome. The no-hitter was the first ever pitched either in a domed stadium or on artificial turf. Along the way, he struck out 15 batters, including Hank Aaron for the final out.(Audio) In the second game of a doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field on July 14, 1968, Wilson set the Astros club record for single-game strikeouts with 18. On May 1, 1969, the day after the Reds' Jim Maloney no-hit the Astros 10–0 at Crosley Field for his second career no-hitter, Wilson returned the favor and no-hit the Reds 4–0 for \"his\" second career no-hitter. (Audio) The back-to-back no-hit feat was only the second in MLB history, the first having been accomplished in September of just the year before by Gaylord Perry and Ray Washburn. This second no-hitter was vengeance for Wilson: in his previous start against the Reds nine days earlier, he had given up seven runs in five innings and was the losing pitcher in the Reds' 14–0 drubbing of the Astros at the Astrodome. That year, the Astros finished .500 (81-81) for the first time in club history, and Wilson struck out 235 batters (his career best) in 225 innings in fashioning a 16–12 record. That season, the Astros set what was then a big-league record for strikeouts in a season by a pitching staff. Two other Houston starters, Larry Dierker and Tom Griffin, also struck out at least 200 batters that season, with Dierker's 232 in 305 innings leading the way. The 1971 season saw Wilson make the National League All-Star Team as well as earn Astros MVP honors. Wilson's last game was a two-hit, 5–0 shutout against the Atlanta Braves on September 28, 1974.\n\nOn January 5, 1975, Wilson died at the house he shared with his wife, daughter, and son in Houston's Fondren Southwest community. Wilson's wife, Bernice, found him in the passenger seat of his Ford Thunderbird, parked inside the garage, with the engine running. The garage was attached to the house, and the carbon monoxide gas fatally asphyxiated his son, Donald \"Alex\" Alexander (aged 5), who was sleeping in the master bedroom above the garage. Wilson's daughter Denise (aged 9), was found unconscious in another bedroom and hospitalized. Bernice was treated for carbon monoxide gas inhalation and for a jaw injury that she could not remember incurring. On February 5, 1975, Dr. Joseph Jachimczyk, the Harris County medical examiner, ruled the deaths of Don and Alex Wilson accidental. Dr. Jachimczyk's autopsy report showed that Wilson had a blood alcohol content of 0.167%. One theory is that Wilson drove into his garage, activated the automatic door closer, and then passed out.\n\nWilson's uniform number was retired by the Astros on April 13, 1975, and a black circular patch with his number 40 in white was worn on the left sleeve of the Astros \"rainbow jerseys\" the following season.\n"}

The term sometimes refers to structural arms in other applications where a suspended load is supported in similar fashion to the naval application.\n\nDavit systems are most often used to lower an emergency lifeboat to the embarkation level to be boarded. Davits can also be used as man-overboard safety devices to retrieve personnel from the water.\n\nThe lifeboat davit has falls (now made of wire, historically of manila rope) that are used to lower the lifeboat into the water. \"Davit\" can also refer to a single mechanical arm with a winch for lowering and raising spare parts onto a vessel and for lowering any other equipment from the deck of a vessel or a pontoon to the water. \nThe maintaining and operation of davits is all under jurisdiction of the International Maritime Organization. The regulations are enforced by the country's own Coast Guard.\n\nThe development of the davit from its original \"goose neck form\" to the current devices advanced greatly when A.P. Schat patented a number of systems in 1926 that allowed the lifeboat to glide over obstructions on a ship's hull, known as the \"Schat Skate\". This was followed by a self-braking winch system that allowed the lifeboat to be lowered evenly. The standard became so common that shipyard specifications call for Schat-type davits which are available from various sources. Similar systems developed by Schat companies are used on offshore oil or gas rigs, being placed around the structure.\n\nDevelopment of the davit has also been in terms of material. Traditionally davits have been made in aluminium or steel but recent advances in composite material have led to the manufacture of davits in carbon fibre which has an excellent power to weight ratio. This means davits can be stowed away when not in use and the same davit used in multiple deck sockets fitted permanently on deck.\n\nDavits are designed to fit into deck spaces that the naval architects deemed necessary:\n\n\n\nThere are 3 basic systems used to release the lifeboat from the davit. (Coast Guard Questions are for the Rottmer, On-Load releasing gear) \n\n\nFor all lifeboats using a roller gravity davit and Rottmer releasing gear, this is the procedure:\n\nDuring this procedure, if the lifeboat has air-cooled engines start it at the beginning. If it has a water-cooled engine start the engine after the lifeboat is in the water.\n"}

The Klingons have put a bounty on Archer following his escape from the Rura Pente gulag, so various bounty hunters are after him now; this episode covers one such capture and subsequent events. This is also another appearance of the TNG-style \"turtle head\" Klingons in \"Enterprise\", and the story arc with the Klingons continues into the next episode, the \"Expanse\", the season finale also.\n\nA major plotline follows a sequence of events with T'Pol after a bacterium induces Pon Farr prematurely, testing the medical and professionalism of Dr. Phlox.\n\nThe crew of the \"Enterprise\" encounters Skalaar, a Tellarite who abruptly offers to give them a tour of a nearby planet. However, Skalaar is actually a bounty hunter who kidnaps Captain Archer, planning to turn him over to the Klingons for payment. The Klingons have apparently placed a substantial price on Archer's head since his escape from . Archer soon learns that Skalaar plans on using the reward to buy back \"Tezra\", his previous ship.\n\nOn \"Enterprise\", Sub-Commander T'Pol and Doctor Phlox begin an hours-long decontamination after a recent away mission. T'Pol begins acting strangely, and begins making sexual overtures to Phlox. It appears that a microbe has activated pon farr, the Vulcan sex drive. Phlox races to find a treatment, but T'Pol's actions become more and more erratic. Finally, she knocks Phlox out and escapes from decontamination. Lieutenant Reed and a security team manage to subdue her. Later, T'Pol wakes up feeling more or less her usual self, and embarrassed by her actions, Phlox promises not to mention what happened to anyone.\n\nMeanwhile, Skalaar runs into trouble when a rival bounty hunter tracks him down and demands that he turn over Archer. Skalaar refuses, and the rival opens fire. In the battle, Archer convinces Skalaar to temporarily free him, and the two men land on a nearby planet to make repairs. As they work, Archer learns more about Skalaar's circumstances. Skalaar turns Archer over to the Klingons as planned, but ends up receiving only two-thirds of the promised reward. In revenge, he alerts \"Enterprise\" to the location of the Klingon ship, and Archer escapes in an escape pod. \"Enterprise\" arrives and retrieves Archer, damaging the Klingon ship enough to end the battle. Some time later, Skalaar contacts Archer and warns that the price on Archer's head will probably double. Grateful, Archer bids Skalaar farewell.\n\n\n"}

Palmer\n\nBartlett Joshua Palmer (September 10, 1881 – May 27, 1961), born in What Cheer, Iowa, was the son of Daniel David Palmer (D.D.), the founder of chiropractic, and became known as the \"Developer\" of chiropractic.\n\nB.J. Palmer was born on September 10, 1881, the son of Daniel David Palmer (or \"D.D.\"), the founder of chiropractic. The Palmer family of six resided in the back of a grocery store that D.D. operated. In 1885 D.D.'s wife became sick and died, after which D.D. remarried several times. When D.D. had settled with a new wife, he moved the family to Letts, Iowa, and he worked as a schoolteacher and a magnetic healer, developing chiropractic.\n\nOn May 30, 1904, B.J. married a woman named Mabel Heath. Both worked as chiropractors and instructors at Palmer College. Mabel Heath Palmer had a heavy load of students and taught mostly anatomy classes. B.J. Palmer ran his research clinics in Davenport for 16 years and eventually became convinced that upper cervical spine was the key to health. He modified the Palmer School of Chiropractic curriculum to reflect his new ideas. Palmer advocated the use of the Neurocalometer and X-ray machines.\n\nOn January 12, 1906, a son David Daniel Palmer was born to B.J. and Mabel Heath, and would be the couple's only child. In keeping with his educational efforts for the profession, he became known as \"The Educator.\" They had an estranged relationship for a number of years when David Daniel decided to attend University of Pennsylvania and later its Wharton School of Business. David explained that he knew that he would one day be in charge of the school, and wanted an education in business to allow him to better manage the college. He also graduated from Palmer as a Doctor of Chiropractic.\n\nIn 1922, Palmer purchased a local radio station, WOC (whose call letters were thought to stand for \"World Of Chiropractic\" or \"Wonders of Chiropractic\" but in reality these call letters were assigned by the government to the previous owner of the station, Robert Karlowa of Rock Island, Illinois). Palmer began using the station to market chiropractic, as well as to broadcast farm, sports and weather reports. Ronald Reagan, future President of the United States and actor, was given his first broadcast job by Dr. Palmer to broadcast sports for WOC. A second station in Des Moines, WHO, (\"With Hands Only\" was also thought to be connected to chiropractic but was not used by the station.) WHO was purchased from Bankers Life in Des Moines in 1930. Neither station ever used the phrases in any of their promotions. Television stations were later added under the same call letters.\n\nFollowing with the extensive world travels that was the trend in the 1920s, B.J., Mabel, and son David traveled through most of Asia. He later wrote a book called 'Round the World with B.J.' that would detail those trips and the people they met. He also published and read some of these stories in the Palmer School's newspaper and on WOC radio station.\n\nMabel Heath died in 1949 from stroke complications. In 1951 B. J. purchased a home on St. Armands Key in Sarasota Florida where he lived out his final years. He died in 1961 due to intestinal cancer. His son, David Daniel Palmer, assumed the role of President of Palmer School of Chiropractic after his father's death.\n\nLike his father, Palmer was against vaccines:\n\nThe house that B. J. and Mabel Palmer lived in is located at 808 Brady Street, Davenport, Iowa. It contains many of the souvenirs collected on their tours of the world. The Palmers added on a porch addition surrounding the original house in the 1920s to help hold their extensive collection.\n\nB. J. Palmer's winter home in Sarasota, Florida is located at 342 No. Washington Drive on St. Armands Key. The home contains many original artifacts including his Roycroft furniture, lamp and clown collection, bedroom furniture, death certificate and a collection of framed documents.\n\nOn August 27, 1913, an incident occurred during a homecoming parade. It resulted in a lawsuit for attempted murder, filed against him by his father. The allegation that B.J. deliberately hit his father with a car on that occasion followed B.J. Palmer for the better part of a generation. A 2008 book, \"Trick or Treatment\", repeats the story and states that in 1913 B.J. Palmer ran over his father at a homecoming parade for the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. Weeks later, D.D. Palmer died in Los Angeles. The official cause of death was recorded as typhoid. The book \"Trick or Treatment\" remarked \"it seems more likely that his death was a direct result of injuries caused by his son.\" There was speculation it was not an accident, but rather a case of patricide. They had become bitter rivals over the leadership of chiropractic. B.J. Palmer resented his father for the way he treated his family, stating that his father beat three of his children with straps and was so much involved in chiropractic that \"he hardly knew he had any children\". D.D. claimed that his son B.J. struck him with his car. Chiropractic historian Joseph C. Keating, Jr. has described the \"patricide\" interpretation of the event as a myth and \"absurd on its face\" and cites an eyewitness who recalled that D.D. was not struck by B.J.'s car, but rather, had stumbled. He also says \"Joy Loban, DC, executor of D.D.'s estate, voluntarily withdrew a civil suit claiming damages against B.J. Palmer, and that several grand juries repeatedly refused to bring criminal charges against the son.\" D.D. Palmer died October 20, 1913. One proposed cause of the accusations and responses was the competition between the schools (Palmer's and Universal's).\n\n"}

It was purchased by Blackwater's Erik Prince in 2007. Over the course of 14 years, the TRC conducted research, analysis, and training on variety of counterterrorism and homeland security issues.\n\nThe TRC web site (which operated at www.terrorism.com since 1996 and then also mirrored at www.homelandsecurity.com starting in 2000) was the top search engine result for “terrorism” and other security keywords for over a decade. The site regularly received as many as 5,000,000 hits per month and had tens of thousands of active registered users. The site has also been cited in thousands of books, news articles, academic papers, and other works.\n\nThe TRC was involved in several major projects, from 1996:\n\nThe TRC conceived, prototyped, designed, built and operated the RKB over a period of six years. The RKB provided emergency responders, purchasers, and planners with a trusted, integrated, online source of information on products, standards, certifications, grants, and other equipment-related information. The RKB was operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from 2008 until it was decommissioned in September 2013.\n\nThe TRC has worked with the Los Angeles Terrorism Early Warning (TEW) Group since 1997. The TRC and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) submitted a grant application to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism to expand the Terrorism Early Warning Group concept to six high threat cities in the U.S. The Terrorism Early Warning Group concept fulfills the intelligence requirements outlined in Homeland Security Directive 8: Interim National Preparedness Goal. After the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the formation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Terrorism Early Warning Group program was migrated to DHS and expanded to cover 56 high threat urban areas. The TRC worked with these 56 cities to develop early warning and intelligence centers that became the precursor the national Fusion Center network.\n\nThe TRC developed the renowned Mirror Image training program in 2001 to allow military, intelligence, security and first responder personnel to better understand the international terrorist threat. Participants were subjected to an intense immersion program where they were trained to think and act like the adversary and adopt their tactics, techniques, and procedures. TRC Mirror Image training became a U.S. Army Foundry course, was featured in major news media, and became the most popular training course the TRC ever developed.\n\nThe TRC provided a free daily news clipping service on a variety of global security issues. An archive of several hundred thousand clippings was available via the TRC web site. The mailing of the TRC free daily news clipping service, became known as the 'early bird of global risk issues'.\n\nThe TRC 'Project Pediatric Preparedness' report responded to emergency preparedness and response planning, technology investments, and training frequently, in respect to the unique requirements of responding to pediatric victims of a larger scale terrorist attack.\nThe project explained these unique needs and gaps, and provided a foundation for homeland security planning for pediatric victims of terrorism. The final report described the minimum capabilities essential for emergency response to pediatric victims. The report laid out fifteen Functional Areas for pediatric response – general areas describing functions, tasks, and missions of emergency response. This report is available on the TRC website.\n\nThe TRC developed a lecture series, that brought together a wide array of experts to discuss emerging threats. These lectures were then released as audio downloads on the site. Popular speakers from the lecture series included Brian Michael Jenkins, Rohan Gunaratna, and Hekmat Karzai.\n\nIn 2005, to honor of TRC's contributions to the first responder community through the development of the RKB system, it received a U.S. flag that had been flown over the U.S. Capitol building (one of more than 100,000 such flags flown annually).\n\nEarly in 2009, none of the TRC founders were still involved with the center. The Terrorism Research Center ceased operations in 2010 at the discretion of new owners and managers.\nIn April 2012, the founders of the TRC announced it was being reconstituted as a non-profit at www.terrorism.org. The new focus was on sponsoring research publications, and facilitating research. In December 2014, the TRC was included as a collaborating partner with the Microsimulation & Risk Modelling Group at the University of Wollongong. The project with them is assessing the tactics and counter tactics involved in lone wolf knife attacks on the public.\n\nThe Terrorism Research Center has initiated sponsorship of new publications in terrorism, and related research areas. The main focus has been research into Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures by its research associates, such as Dr. Robert J. Bunker, and Dr. Chris Flaherty. The 2012-2014 Terrorism Research Center sponsored publications:\nThe TRC research in 2013 made a significant contribution to the understanding of surgically implanted explosive devices, better known as the 'Body Cavity Bomb' (BCB) concept:\n\nThe TRC research in 2014 has continued to develop new publications in terrorism, and related research areas, with the latest research, on interposing tactics, as a branch of Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, by its research associate Dr. Chris Flaherty.\n\nThe TRC research in 2014, has also developed a new reader on Fifth Dimensional Operations:\n\nThe 2015 published TRC research has included a new reader on current terrorism analysis, and has continued work on Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): \n\n\n"}

Critical reception to this episode was mostly positive, with praise directed at Scott Bakula. However, the episode received the second-lowest number of viewers received by \"Enterprise\" at that point, which was blamed on it being aired opposite the series finale of \"Dawson's Creek\".\n\nAs \"Enterprise\" is about to investigate a dark matter cloud, Captain Archer is informed by Admiral Forrest that his former Starfleet colleague, Captain Robinson, has died in a rock climbing accident.

Sub-Commander T'Pol, noting that captains are prohibited from traveling off-ship unaccompanied, joins him and while underway, she coaxes him into relating the story of the Warp 5 program on Earth.\n\nIn a series of flashbacks, Commander Archer meets with Commodore Forest, and is informed that although he excelled in simulations, his colleague Commander Robinson has been awarded the test ship, the \"NX Alpha\". Disappointed, Archer goes to the 602 Club, a local bar, bumping into Robinson there. Later, Robinson takes the scheduled flight aboard the \"NX Alpha\", breaking the warp 2.0 barrier. He refuses a command from Forest to stop and instead increases speed; the craft soon destabilizes and is destroyed as it approaches warp 2.2, but Robinson escapes. The Vulcans argue that the warp program should be postponed, but Archer wants the program, and his father's engine research, to continue. Archer, and his new friend Lieutenant Tucker, then go to the 602 Club to discuss the problem. Robinson arrives and blames Archer's father, and the two end up in a fist fight.\n\nThe next day Archer discovers Robinson packing up the contents of his locker. He concedes that it is primarily an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the \"NX Beta\", with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the \"Alpha\". As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.\n\n\"First Flight\" was inspired by the 1983 film \"The Right Stuff\", the story of the test pilots at Edwards Air Force Base and the first NASA astronauts. Reference is also made to the Apollo 11 lunar landing, when Archer mentions that no-one remembers astronaut Buzz Aldrin's first words when he stepped onto the moon. His actual first words were \"Beautiful view.\"\n\nWarp drive was first mentioned in Gene Roddenberry's first-draft pitch for \"Star Trek\", dated March 11, 1964, although in that version it was referred to as a \"space-warp drive\". The drive allows for a vessel to travel faster than the speed of light by warping space-time around the ship itself. In 1994, physicist Miguel Alcubierre created the theoretical Alcubierre drive, which used a similar theory. In the \"Star Trek\" universe, Zefram Cochrane invented the drive in 2063. Cochrane was portrayed by James Cromwell in the film \"\" and re-appeared in this role in the pilot of \"Enterprise\", \"\". That episode showed the culmination of the development of the warp 5 engine, which was designed by Jonathan Archer's father, Henry, in the launch of the \"Enterprise\" itself. The Vulcans during this period gave oversight and advice to Starfleet in the development of the warp drive, but sought to slow the progress of the humans. \"First Flight\" showed a previously unseen period in the development of the fictional warp drive, with the pursuit of the warp 2 barrier. The dark matter seen in this episode is a real phenomenon, however it is unclear exactly what it is. It cannot be seen by telescopes, and it is theorised that it makes up a great deal of the matter in the universe.\n\nJohn Shiban and Chris Black wrote \"First Flight\", the fiftieth episode of \"Enterprise\". Former \"\" actor LeVar Burton directed the episode, his second of the season and fourth overall. He had previously directed episodes of other shows in the franchise, including the hundredth episode of \"\", \"\". In this episode, Tucker states that his commanding officer at the testing facility is Captain Jefferies, this is a direct reference to Matt Jefferies, designer of the original USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701). Jefferies died two months after the episode was aired.\n\nProduction began on March 10, 2003, and concluded on March 18. The first days' shoot consisted of scenes in the shuttlepod with Blalock and Bakula as other members of the cast were still shooting scenes for the episodes \"\" and \"\". The present-day scenes were completed on the second day of filming, with the remaining five days of shooting being devoted to the flashback scenes. Sets were built specifically for this episode, including the NX Command Center, the 602 Club and the interior of the NX prototype vessels.\n\nThe guest cast in \"First Flight\" included the return of Vaughn Armstrong in the recurring role of Admiral Forrest, although this was his most demanding shoot so far, requiring him to be on set for five of the seven days of filming. Keith Carradine was cast as A. G. Robinson; Carradine is also a musician, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"I'm Easy\" from the 1975 film \"Nashville\". He is also the half-brother of fellow actor David Carradine. This episode also saw the return of some actors who had appeared in other series of the \"Star Trek\" franchise. These included Michael Canavan, who appeared in this episode as a Vulcan advisor, but previously appeared in the \"\" episode \"\" as a member of the Maquis terrorist group. Also appearing in \"First Flight\" was Victor Bevine. He had previously appeared in \"DS9\", \"Voyager\" and the movie \"Star Trek: First Contact\".\n\n\"First Flight\" also provided the stage for an exchange with the United States Navy aircraft carrier USS \"Enterprise\" (CVN-65). Three crew members of the real-life \"Enterprise\" had been voted as \"Sailors of the Year\" by the U.S. Navy, and so were given the roles of extras in this episode. This was not the first time such an exchange had occurred; previous winners had appeared as crew members on board the fictional \"Enterprise\" in the episode \"Desert Crossing\". However, this time around they were given roles at the NX Command Center instead. Aviation Maintenance Administrationman 2nd Class James D. Frey portrayed a technician, Navy Counselor 1st Class Kathleen J. Grant played a Senator and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Thomas P. Hunt was the Senator's assistant. All three were pleased to be appearing on the show, with Grant saying that \"My nephew told all of the kids at his school his aunt was going to be on Star Trek. That makes the experience even more of a thrill for me\", and Hunt saying \"This will be on reruns for years to come, when I'm 60, I'll be able to say, 'Hey, that's me on Enterprise.'\". In return, the three sailors presented the cast and crew of \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" with a flag that had been flying on the aircraft carrier earlier in the month.\n\n\"First Flight\" was first shown in the United States on May 14, 2003 on UPN. It was aired on the same night as the following episode, \"\". Both episodes saw a reduction in viewing figures compared to previous weeks, which was attributed to them being broadcast at the same time as the series finale of \"Dawson's Creek\" on The WB. \"First Flight\" received a 2.4/4% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was the second lowest rating received by the series at that point, and \"Bounty\" received a slightly decreased rating of 2.3/4%, but the viewing figures were higher. Bounty was watched by 3.54 million reviewers, whereas \"First Flight\" was watched by 3.3 million. \"First Flight\" was the 93rd most watched programme of the evening. The episode aired during the following week was the season two finale, whose figures rebounded slightly; \"The Expanse\" had a final rating of 2.8/4% with an audience of 3.88 million.\n\nMichelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, and thought that Scott Bakula in particular gave one of his best performances of the show so far. Both he and Carradine worked well together, but thought that the other characters in the flashback were clichéd. Overall, she thought it was a \"superbly filmed episode\" with several new sets which were well used, and the visual effects were good. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" gave the episode a score of three out of four, saying that he welcomed the back story to the series being fleshed out in this episode. He thought that the episode itself wasn't very challenging to watch, but thought that the melancholy ending was fitting. He even thought that it might be worthwhile to go further back in time to see the actual founding of Starfleet.\n\nIn 2009, \"Den of Geek\" ranked this the ninth best episode of this television series.\n\n\"First Flight\" was first released for home media use on DVD as part of the second series box set of \"\". The release featured text commentary on the episode from \"Star Trek\" and NASA designers Michael and Denise Okuda. The episode also featured as one of the three \"Enterprise\" episodes on the \"Star Trek\" Fan Collective DVD Set \"Captain's Log\". The set featured episodes selected by each of the Captains from the \"Star Trek\" series, and several chosen by the fans, a total of seventeen episodes. A release on Blu-ray Disc for season two occurred on August 20, 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951218", "title": "Saltoposuchus", "text": "Saltoposuchus\n\nSaltoposuchus is an extinct genus of small (1-1.5 m and 10-15 kg), long-tailed crocodylomorph reptile (Sphenosuchia), from the Norian (Late Triassic) of Europe. The name translated means \"leaping foot crocodile\". It has been proposed that \"Terrestrisuchus gracilis\" and \"Saltoposuchus connectens\" represent different ontogenetic stages of the same genus. \"Saltoposuchus\" is commonly (and incorrectly) referred to in popular literature as the ancestor (or close ancestors) to dinosaurs, however, recent scientific research show that this is not the case.\n\nFossil evidence of Sphenosuchia and early crocodylomorphs lead paleontologists to conclude that \"Saltoposuchus\" is a terrestrial animal. As a monophyletic group of crocodylomorphs, Saltoposuchidae have many key morphological traits shared with most crocodylomorphs.\n\nMuch like other crocodylomorphs, \"Saltoposuchus\" skulls had a (reduced) antorbital fenestra, an overhanging squamosal bone, and a medially shifted, forwards sloping quadrate and quadratojugal. \"Saltoposuchus\" have a long pointed skull and slender pointed teeth. The pointed teeth of \"Saltoposuchus\" indicate that this species is most likely carnivorous. At the back of the skull, \"Saltoposuchus\" share many specializations of crocodylomorphs including a square skull table made out of post-orbital and squamosal bones which overhangs the temporal region, a lateral mandibular fenestra, and a cheek region that is overhung by the squamosal. In \"Sphenosucians\", the quadrate head makes contact with the prootic and squamosal bones.\n\n\"Saltoposuchus\" a long backward pointing spine at the coracoid. Another key feature of \"Saltoposuchus\" includes a non-preforated acetabulum (hip joint), which is a defining characteristic of all dinosaurs. \"Saltoposuchus\" were also considered to be bipedal based on its skeletal constitution, but could walk on all four limbs as well, making it a facultative biped. \"Saltoposuchus\" also had a double row of bony scutes along its back, which can be seen on modern crocodilians today. Like with other sphenosuchians and early crocodylomorphs, \"Saltoposuchus\" had fully erect slender limbs, a slender body, and long legs. Paleontologists believe that with their body structures that \"Saltoposuchus\" were very fast and nimble. Sphenosuchians have been described as \"greyhound dog[s] with scales and a long tail.\" Early crocodylomorphs, such as \"Saltoposuchus\", have very long centra in their vertebrae, short vertebral processes, and medium-sized zygapophyseal joints. Molnar et Al. concluded that the average mediolateral range of motion in the early crocodylomorphs was greater than dorsoventral range of motion, and dorsoventral stiffness was estimated to be higher than mediolateral stiffness. In the wrists of \"Saltoposuchus\", the radiale and ulnare are elongated into rod shaped elements instead of being button-shaped, which is a shared characteristic among crocodylomorphs.\n\nThe \"Saltoposuchus\" is a terrestrial animal whose body was built for running at fast speeds. Based on the behavior of other species of archosaur, it is possible that the \"Saltoposuchus\" hunted in packs just like another archosaur genus, \"Coelophysis.\" It is also possible that \"Saltoposuchus\" could exhibit cannibalistic behavior because a few of the \"Coelophysis\" individuals found had remains of smaller members of the species inside the larger animals. By looking at the diet of related species, we can assume that \"Saltoposuchus\" ate small lizards, insects, and mammals that existed during the Triassic Period.\n\n\"Saltoposuchus connectens\" and \"Saltoposuchus longipes\" were discovered and named by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1921. Both species were found in the Burrer Quarry, Pfaffenhofen, which is an Alaunian terrestrial sandstone/marl in the Löwenstein Formation of south-west Germany. The Löwenstein Formation has been dated back to 215.6 - 212.0 Ma, which dates back to the Late Triassic Period. Fossils have also been found in the Trossingen Formation (also located in Germany), and the Lossiemouth Sandstone formation.\n\nFossils found in Germany indicate that \"Saltoposuchus\" existed in Europe, or more appropriately, Laurasia. The Mesozoic Era has been regarded as \"The Age of Reptiles\" so \"Saltoposuchus\" lived among many different species including the earliest species of pterosaurs and other bipedal reptilians. Archosaurs, the ancestor to Crocodylomorpha, made its first appearance in the middle of the Triassic era. This is also the period in which the earliest mammals started appearing. Therapsids dominated the Early - Middle Triassic Period, but as time went on, therapsids started becoming extinct and archosaurs became the dominant group of reptiles. After the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out 90% of species in the world, conifer forests started to recover, species started occupying and thriving in newly found ecological niches, Pangaea started splitting into Laurasia and Gondwana, and the air was very arid with hot summers and cold winters. After marine life had been wiped out by the mass extinction event, the Triassic waters were populated with very few families of fish. The Triassic Period showed the first development of modern stony corals and a time of modest reef building activity in the shallower waters of the Tethys near the coasts of Pangaea. During the Mesozoic Era, early mammals, reptilian species, and other insects populated the land. Insects that had survived the mass extinction and were existing during this time include spiders, scorpions, millipedes, centipedes, and a newer group of beetles.\n\nSister groups to \"Saltoposuchus\" include \"Gracilisuchus\", \"Hesperosuchus\", \"Dromicosuchus\", \"Dibothrosuchus\", \"Terrestrisuchus\", \"Litargosuchus\", \"Kayentasuchus\". These genus are found in the late Triassic to the earlier Jurassic eras. All of these genus are part of the \"Sphenosuchia\" clade and they all have similar morphology and stature. \"Sphenosuchia\" are ancestors to crocodyliformes, which constitute modern crocodilians. Modern crocodylia reacquired semi-aquatic life style. Research has disputed the reasoning for how crocodyliformes reacquired semi-aquatic traits, and the forefront explanation the changes in osteoderm and rib morphology over crocodylomorph evolution affected the stiffness of the vertebral columns, which would allow for better movement in semi-aquatic environments.\n\nThis group has species that are approximately 0.3 meters long and is classified as a primitive sphenosuchian. Like \"Saltoposuchus,\" this species was thought to have been able to run on its slim hindlegs. This group of reptiles had a disproportionately large head, strong jaws, and bony plates extending from the back to the tail. It most likely ate small lizards.\n\nThis group's specimens are around 0.5 meters long. Similarly to \"Saltoposuchus\", \"Terrestrisuchus\" were known to have a delicate frame and could run at fast speeds for long distances.\n\nTwo early crocodylamorph species that are sister groups to \"Saltoposuchus\". They share many similar traits and morphology with \"Saltoposuchus\" and the discovery of these groups convinced Paleontologists that these genus are not monophyletic with \"Sphenosuchus\" (not to be confused with the suborder \"Sphenosuchia\").\n\n"}
{"id": "1951225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951225", "title": "Pierre Poiret", "text": "Pierre Poiret\n\nPierre Poiret Naudé (15 April 1646 – 21 May 1719) was a prominent 17th century French mystic and Christian philosopher. He was born at Metz April 15, 1646 and died at Rijnsburg (3 m. n. of Leyden) May 21, 1719.\n\nAfter the early death of his parents, he supported himself by the engraver's trade and the teaching of French, at the same time studying theology, in Basel, Hanau, and, after 1668, Heidelberg. At Basel he was captivated by Descartes' philosophy, which never quite lost its hold on him. He read also Thomas à Kempis and Tauler, but was especially influenced by the writings of the Dutch Mennonite mystic Hendrik Jansen van Barrefelt (Hiël) (c. 1520 - c. 1594), whose works were published under the pseudonym of Hiël.\n\nIn 1672 he became pastor of the French church at Annweiler in the duchy of Deux-Ponts. Here he became acquainted with Elisabeth, abbess of Herford, the granddaughter of James I of England and a noted mystic, with the Theologia Germanica, and with the writings of Antoinette Bourignon, which last supplied exactly what he wanted. The desire to make the acquaintance of this gifted woman took him to the Netherlands in 1676. He settled in Amsterdam, and published there in the following year his \"Cogitationzs rationales de Deo, anima, et Malo\", which gained him an immediate reputation for scholarship and philosophic insight. It is Cartesian in form; the Trinity is conceived in mathematical terms; all knowledge is to rest on evidence - but the end of this knowledge of God is practical, to lead distracted Christendom back to unity. The influence of Thomas à Kempis and Tauler is plainly visible.\n\nFrom the Netherlands Poiret went on to Hamburg, still in quest of Antoinette Bourignon, was completely won by her at the first meeting, and until her death in 1680, he was her faithful disciple. He accompanied her in her wanderings, traveled several times as far as Holstein in connection with her exceedingly confused affairs, and returned to Amsterdam to see to the publication of her complete works, to which he prefixed a thoroughgoing defense of her and added a translation of the Göttliche Gesicht of Hans Engelbrecht, the Brunswick enthusiast. He defended her character and divine mission in a \"Mémoire touchant la vie de Mlle. A. Bourignon\" (1679), and championed her cause against Bayle and Seckendorf. He was also a warm admirer of Jane Lead. In 1688 he settled at Rijnsburg, where he busied himself on his own works and in multifarious labors for the Dutch booksellers, such as in the Dutch edition of Thierry Ruinart.\n\nAmong his original productions may be mentioned \"L'Économie divine, ou système universel et démontré des oeuvres et des desseins de Dieu envers les hommes\" (Amsterdam, 1687; Eng. transl., The Divine Œconomy, 6 vols., London, 1713), which purports to reproduce the visionary notions of Antoinette Bourignon, but at least gives them an intelligible and consistent form. Another work, \"La Paix des ames dans tous les partis du Christianisme\" (1687), disregards the formal creeds of the various churches, and appeals to the minority of really sincere Christians, urging them to an inner union without the abandonment of their external affiliations. In \"De erudition, solida, superfciaria et falsa\" (1692), he distinguishes between superficial knowledge of the names of things and real or solid knowledge of the things themselves, which latter is to be attained by humble renunciation of one's own wisdom and will. He continued to make contributions to the philosophical and religious controversies of the time, as, for example, against Bayle and his \"hypocritical\" opposition to Spinoza. The work which probably ran through the most editions was the little treatise on the education of children which first appeared in 1690 a collection of his shorter writings: was frequently translated, and influenced the Pietistic controversy at Hamburg. His most permanently valuable contribution was \"Bibliotheca mysticorum selecta\" (1708), which displays an astonishing acquaintance with ancient and modern mystics, and contains valuable information on some of the less-known writers. He also published a large number of mystical writings both from the Middle Ages and from the French Pietists of the seventeenth century. In 1704 he brought out a new edition of Mme. Guyon's writings, with the addition of a treatise printed for the first time and an introduction. In spite of his devotion to her, he was not a Quietist in the ordinary sense of the word. He would not have man's relation to God one of pure passivity but of receptivity. He repudiated predestination, and condemned Pelagianism because it suppressed the feeling of inherent sinfulness in man — just as he opposed Socinianism because it did not ascribe the whole of salvation to the operation of God's grace. Mystic as he was, he knew how to combine with his own peculiar attitude a firm insistence on certain dogmatic definitions, such as that of the Trinity. He continually appealed to the authority of Scripture.\n\nThough after 1680 he led a quiet and retired life, he was recognized widely by the scholars of his time, such as Thomasius and Bayle, Jean Le Clerc and Walch, as a man of great learning; and his zealous participation in the cause of Antoinette Bourignon did not injure his good name as a devout mystic and an honorable man. His influence persisted after his death, not merely through the work of his spiritual son Tersteegen, but through the respect which his writings won for mysticism, forcing the regular theology, as represented by Le Clerc, Lange, Buddeus, Walch, and Johann Friedrich Stapfer, to take account of it.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951235", "title": "Metallurgical Laboratory", "text": "Metallurgical Laboratory\n\nThe Metallurgical Laboratory (or Met Lab) was a scientific laboratory at the University of Chicago that was established in February 1942 to study and use the newly discovered chemical element plutonium. It researched plutonium's chemistry and metallurgy, designed the world's first nuclear reactors to produce it, and developed chemical processes to separate it from other elements. In August 1942 the lab's chemical section was the first to chemically separate a weighable sample of plutonium, and on 2 December 1942, the Met Lab produced the first controlled nuclear chain reaction, in the reactor Chicago Pile-1, which was constructed under the stands of the university's old football stadium, Stagg Field.\n\nThe Metallurgical Laboratory was established as part of the Metallurgical Project, also known as the \"Pile\" or \"X-10\" Project, headed by Chicago professor Arthur H. Compton, a Nobel Prize laureate. In turn, this was part of the Manhattan Project – the Allied effort to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. The Metallurgical Laboratory was successively led by Richard L. Doan, Samuel K. Allison, Joyce C. Stearns and Farrington Daniels. Scientists who worked there included Enrico Fermi, James Franck, Eugene Wigner and Glenn Seaborg. At its peak on 1 July 1944, it had 2,008 staff.\n\nChicago Pile-1 was soon moved by the lab to a more remote site in the Argonne Forest, where its original materials were used to build an improved Chicago Pile-2 to be employed in new research into the products of nuclear fission. Another reactor, Chicago Pile-3, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use heavy water as a neutron moderator. It went critical in May 1944, and was first operated at full power in July 1944. The Metallurgical Laboratory also designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the B Reactor at the Hanford Engineer Works in the state of Washington.\n\nAs well as the work on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the chemistry and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946. The work of the Met Lab also led to the creation of the Enrico Fermi Institute and the James Franck Institute at the university.\n\nThe discovery of nuclear fission in uranium by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up the possibility that neutrons produced by fission could create a controlled nuclear chain reaction. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. In August 1939, Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German nuclear weapon project, and convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it. This resulted in support for research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government.\n\nIn April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the University of Chicago, to report on the uranium program. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers, such as plutonium-239, were fissile. Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. While minute quantities of plutonium-239 could be created in cyclotrons, it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way. Compton conferred with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber from the University of Illinois about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from.\n\nOn 20 December, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into the war, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts. It fell to Compton to decide which of these should be pursued. He proposed an ambitious schedule that aimed to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have a deliverable atomic bomb by January 1945.\n\nCompton felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California created too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided to concentrate the work at his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration, whereas Columbia was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts and was hesitant to add another secret project. Other factors contributing to the decision were Chicago's central location and the availability of scientists, technicians and facilities in the Midwest that had not yet been taken away by war work. Housing was more readily available, and an inland city was less vulnerable to enemy attack.\n\nThe new research establishment was formed in February 1942, and named the \"Metallurgical Laboratory\" or \"Met Lab\". Some real metallurgy was carried out, but the name was intended as a cover for its activities. The University of Chicago had been considering establishing a research institute into metals, and indeed would do so after the war, so its creation attracted little attention. Compton's plutonium project then became known as the Metallurgical Project. The Metallurgical Laboratory was administered by the University of Chicago under contract to the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).\n\nOver 5,000 people in 70 research groups participated in Compton's Metallurgical Project, also known as the \"Pile\" or \"X-10\" Project, of whom some 2,000 worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Despite the good salaries being offered, recruiting was difficult. There was competition for scientists and engineers from other defense-related projects, and Chicago was expensive compared with university towns.\n\nNorman Hilberry was associate director of the Metallurgical Project, and Richard L. Doan was appointed the Director of the Metallurgical Laboratory. While Doan was an able administrator, he had difficulty being accepted as the head of the laboratory, since he was not an academic. On 5 May 1943, Compton replaced him with Samuel K. Allison, and appointed Henry D. Smyth as associate director. Initially there were three physics groups, headed by Allison, Fermi and Martin D. Whitaker. Frank Spedding was in charge of the Chemistry Division. He was later succeeded by Herbert McCoy, and then by James Franck. Compton placed Robert Oppenheimer in charge of the bomb design effort in June 1942. In November 1942, this became a separate project, known as Project Y, which was located in Los Alamos, New Mexico.\n\nAfter the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project in August 1942, the Manhattan District coordinated the work. From 17 February 1943, Compton reported to the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., instead of the OSRD S-1 Section. The Manhattan District assumed full responsibility for the Metallurgical Laboratory contract on 1 May 1943. Captain J. F. Grafton was appointed the Chicago Area Engineer in August 1942. He was succeeded by Captain Arthur V. Peterson in December 1942. Peterson remained until October 1944. Captain J. F. McKinley became Chicago Area Engineer on 1 July 1945.\n\nAt first, most of the Laboratory facilities were provided by the University of Chicago. The physicists took over space under the North and West Stands of Stagg Field and in the Service Building, where there was a cyclotron. The chemists took over the George Herbert Jones Laboratory and the Kent Chemical Laboratory. The health group took space in the Anatomy Building, Drexel House, Billings Hospital and the Killis Laboratory and the administrative offices went into Eckhart Hall. Szilard later wrote that \"the morale of the scientists could almost be plotted in a graph by counting the number of lights burning after dinner in the offices at Eckhart Hall.\" When the project outgrew its space in Eckhart Hall, it moved into the nearby Ryerson Hall. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually occupied of campus space. About $131,000 worth of alterations were made to buildings occupied by the laboratory but the University of Chicago also had to make alterations for users displaced by it.\nThe University of Chicago made a site occupied by tennis courts available to the Manhattan District on a one dollar lease, for the construction of a new chemistry building with of space. Stone and Webster commenced work on this in September 1942 and it was completed in December. It was soon found to be too small and an adjacent plot was added to the lease, on which a annex was built and completed in November 1943. Extensive work was then carried out on the ventilation system to allow the laboratory to work with plutonium more safely. A site containing an ice house and stables owned by the University in Chicago was made available in April 1943. Known as Site B, it was remodeled to provide of laboratories and workshops for the health and metallurgy groups. The 124th Field Artillery Armory was leased from the state of Illinois to provide more space in March 1944 and about of space was leased or built, at a cost of $2 million.\n\nFor reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities for experiments with nuclear reactors in densely populated Chicago. Compton selected a site in the Argonne Forest, part of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, about southwest of central Chicago, referred to as Site A. The War Department leased of land there from Cook County for the duration of the war plus one year for a dollar. Construction of facilities including laboratories and service buildings and an access road was commenced in September 1942 and completed in early 1943. Compton appointed Fermi as the first director of the Argonne Laboratory.\n\nBetween 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert L. Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed sixteen experimental reactors (known at the time as \"piles\") under the Stagg Field stands. Fermi designed a new uranium and graphite pile that could be brought to criticality in a controlled, self-sustaining nuclear reaction. Construction at Argonne fell behind schedule due to Stone & Webster's difficulty recruiting enough skilled workers and obtaining the required building materials. This led to an industrial dispute, with union workers taking action over the recruitment of non-union labor. When it became clear that the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed, Compton approved a proposal from Fermi to build the pile under the stands at Stagg Field.\n\nConstruction of the reactor, known as Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), began on the morning of 16 November 1942. The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, high, wide at the ends and across the middle. It contained of uranium metal, of uranium oxide and of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million. On 2 December 1942, it achieved the first controlled self-sustaining nuclear reaction. On 12 December 1942, CP-1's power output was increased to 200 W, enough to power a light bulb. Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity. Thereafter, testing was continued at the lower power of 0.5 W.\n\nThe operation of Chicago Pile-1 was terminated on 28 February 1943. It was dismantled and moved to Argonne, where the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about tall with a base approximately square. It was surrounded by concrete walls thick that acted as a radiation shield, and with overhead protection from of lead and of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained of uranium and of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943.\n\nA second reactor, known as Chicago Pile-3, or CP-3, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use heavy water as a neutron moderator. It had been unavailable when CP-1 was built, but was now becoming available in quantity thanks to the Manhattan Project's P-9 Project. The reactor was a large aluminum tank, in diameter, which was filled with heavy water, which weighed about . The cover was pierced by regularly spaced holes through which 121 uranium rods sheathed in aluminum projected into the heavy water. The tank was surrounded by a graphite neutron reflector, which in turn was surrounded by a lead shield, and by concrete. Shielding on the top of the reactor consisted of layers of square removable bricks composed of layers of iron and masonite. The heavy water was cooled with a water-cooled heat exchanger. As well as the control rods, there was an emergency mechanism for dumping the heavy water into a tank below. Construction began on 1 January 1944. The reactor went critical in May 1944, and was first operated at full power of 300 kW in July 1944.\n\nDuring the war Zinn allowed it to be run around the clock, and its design made it easy to conduct experiments. This included tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.\n\nThe design of the reactors for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, and so it was chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen on the basis of its availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.\nThe decision of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, because it could be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, and it would have to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.\n\nIn early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that included Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a design for a production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.\n\nThe design used a thin layer of aluminum to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.\n\nThe use of water as a coolant raised the problem of corrosion and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect. It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic, so dilute sulfuric acid was added to the water to give it a pH of 6.5. Other additives such as sodium silicate, sodium dichromate and oxalic acid were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water. The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it came into contact with the water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons. The aluminum canning process was given close attention, as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor, and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the canning process.\n\nAn important area of research concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.\n\nMetallurgical work concentrated on uranium and plutonium. Although it had been discovered over a century before, little was known about uranium, as evidenced by the fact that many references gave a figure for its melting point that was off by nearly 500 °F (280 °C). Edward Creutz investigated it and discovered that at the right temperature range, uranium could be hammered and rolled, and drawn into the rods required by the production reactor design. It was found that when uranium was cut, the shavings would burst into flame. Working with Alcoa and General Electric, the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug.\n\nUnder pressure to identify a source of processed uranium, in April 1942 Compton, Spedding and Hilberry met with Edward Mallinckrodt at his chemical company's headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. The company devised and implemented a novel uranium processing technique using ether, submitted successful test materials by mid-May, supplied the material for the first self-sustaining reaction in December, and had satisfied the project's entire order of the first sixty tons before the contract was signed.\n\nThe metallurgy of plutonium was completely unknown, for it had only recently been discovered. In August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.\n\nThe dangers of radiation poisoning had become well known due to the experience of the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.\n\nThe Metallurgical Laboratory's Health Division set standards for radiation exposure. Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics, but this could be too late. Personal quartz fiber dosimeters were procured, as were film badge dosimeters, which recorded cumulative dosage. Stone's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors, including portable Geiger counters. Herbert M. Parker created a metric for radiation exposure he called the roentgen equivalent man or rem. After the war, this replaced the roentgen as the standard measure of radiation exposure. Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works began producing it in 1943. The project set a limit of 5 micrograms (μg) in the body, and work practices and workplaces at Chicago and Clinton were modified to ensure that this standard was met.\n\nDuring 1943 and 1944, the Metallurgical Laboratory focused on first getting the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works up and running, and then the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. By the end of 1944, the focus had switched to training operators. Much of the chemistry division moved to Oak Ridge in October 1943, and many personnel were transferred to other Manhattan Project sites in 1944, particularly Hanford and Los Alamos. Fermi became a division head at Los Alamos in September 1944, and Zinn became the director of the Argonne Laboratory. Allison followed in November 1944, taking with him many of the Metallurgical Laboratory's staff, including most of the instrument section. He was replaced by Joyce C. Stearns. Farrington Daniels, who became associate director on 1 September 1944, succeeded Stearns as director on 1 July 1945.\nWhere possible, the University of Chicago attempted to re-employ workers who had been transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended. Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; all the rest lost 20 percent or more of their staff. From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.\n\nThe end of the war did not end the flow of departures. Seaborg left on 17 May 1946, taking much of what remained of the chemistry division with him. On 11 February 1946, the Army reached an agreement with University President Robert Hutchins for the staff and equipment of the Metallurgical Project to be taken over by a regional laboratory based at Argonne, which the university still manages. On 1 July 1946, the Metallurgical Laboratory became Argonne National Laboratory, the first designated national laboratory, with Zinn as its first director. The new laboratory had 1,278 staff on 31 December 1946, when the Manhattan Project ended, and responsibility for the national laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Commission, which replaced the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947. The work of the Metallurgical Laboratory also led to the founding of the Enrico Fermi Institute, as well as the James Franck Institute, at the University of Chicago.\n\nPayments made to the University of Chicago under the original 1 May 1943 non-profit contract totaled $27,933,134.83, which included $647,671.80 in construction and remodeling costs. The contract expired on 30 June 1946, and was replaced by a new contract, which ended on 31 December 1946. A further $2,756,730.54 was paid under this contract, of which $161,636.10 was spent on construction and remodeling. An additional $49,509.83 was paid to the University of Chicago for the restoration of its facilities.\n\nIn 1974, the United States government began cleaning up the old Manhattan Project sites under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). This included those used by the Metallurgical Laboratory. Stagg Field had been demolished in 1957, but 23 locations in Kent Laboratory were decontaminated in 1977, and another 99 at the Eckhart, Ryerson, and the Jones Laboratory in 1984. About of solid and three 55-gallon drums of liquid waste were collected and shipped to various sites for disposal. The Atomic Energy Commission terminated its lease on the Armory site in 1951, and it was restored to the state of Illinois. Testing in 1977, 1978 and 1987 indicated residual levels of radioactivity that exceeded Department of Energy guidelines, so decontamination was carried out in 1988 and 1989, after which the site was declared suitable for unrestricted use.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1951262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951262", "title": "European Space Research Organisation", "text": "European Space Research Organisation\n\nThe European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) was an international organisation founded by 10 European nations with the intention of jointly pursuing scientific research in space. It was founded in 1964. As an organisation ESRO was based on a previously existing international scientific institution, CERN.\nThe ESRO convention, the organisations founding document outlines it as an entity exclusively devoted to scientific pursuits. This was the case for most of its lifetime but in the final years before the formation of ESA, the European Space Agency, ESRO began a programme in the field of telecommunications. Consequently, ESA is not a mainly pure science focused entity but concentrates on telecommunications, earth observation and other application motivated activities. ESRO was merged with ELDO in 1975 to form the European Space Agency.\n\nThe origins of a joint European space effort are generally traced back to a number of initiatives taken in 1959 and 1960 by a small group of scientists and science administrators, catalysed by two friends, physicists and scientific statesmen, the Italian Edoardo Amaldi and the Frenchman Pierre Victor Auger. Neither Amaldi nor Auger was a stranger to the cause of scientific collaboration on a European scale. Indeed, it was they who, in the early 1950s, were key actors in the process which led to the setting up of CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nNow, as the decade drew to a close, they turned their attention to space. Success was rapid. Within a year of the first formal discussions being held amongst scientists, European governments had set up a preparatory commission in order to explore the possibilities for a joint space research effort.\n\nThe European Preparatory Commission for Space Research (, COPERS) held its first session in Paris on 13 and 14 March 1961. Its first task was to create the organs needed to define the scientific programme and the necessary infrastructure of the envisaged organisation, to draw up its budget, and to prepare a Convention for signature by those member state governments who wished to join it. To this end the meeting first elected its \"bureau\": chairman Harrie Massey, vice-chairmen, Luigi Broglio and Hendrik van de Hulst, and executive secretary Pierre Auger, all men who had played an important role in the debates in 1960 and, Auger apart, still active and eminent European space scientists. It then established two working groups.\n\nThe first was the \"Interim Scientific and Technical Working Group\" and its task was to prepare the scientific programme for the future space organisation, paying particular attention to the technical and financial implications of its proposals. Lamek Hulthén, from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, was nominated chairman of this group; Reimar Lüst from the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Garching, Germany was appointed its coordinating secretary.\n\nThe second was the \"Legal, Administrative and Financial Working Group\". Its chairman was initially left open, though it was recommended that he be someone from the German Federal Republic. Alexander Hocker, a senior bureaucrat from Bad-Godesberg who was the chairman of the CERN Finance Committee at the time, took on this task. All Member States were to be represented on both working groups, which were empowered to set up subgroups to facilitate their work.\n\nBy the third meeting of COPERS on 24 and 25 October 1961 in Munich, the \"Interim Scientific and Technical Working Group\" had prepared a 77-page document outlining the future European Space Research Organisation. The so-called \"Blue Book\" was divided into five parts, each devoted to one of the following subjects:\n\nThe Blue Book foresaw the firing of some 435 sounding rockets and the successful development and launching of 17 satellites in the 8 years covered by the ESRO Convention, namely 11 small satellites, 4 space probes, and 2 large satellites. It was assumed that 2 launchings would be required to orbit one successful spacecraft, so the number of satellite and space probes launchings budgeted for was doubled. The total cost of the satellite programme was estimated at 733.5 million ₣, of which 450 million ₣ was for launchers and launch operations and 283.5 million ₣ for spacecraft development.\n\nThe Blue Book was more a manifesto of interests and expectations than a concrete working hypothesis. It only reflected the intentions and hopes of important sectors of the European scientific community while ignoring their lack of capacity to fulfill these intentions. The fact that transforming the manifesto into a true operational programme would be a long and laborious process and the results sometimes disappointing.\n\nThe ESRO Convention entered into force on 20 March 1964. The ten founding states were Belgium, Denmark, France, (Federal Republic of) Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the\nUnited Kingdom. Two other countries which had participated in the early COPERS activities, Austria and Norway, decided not to join the new organisation but retained an observer status. The first\nmeeting of the Council opened in Paris three days later with Harrie Massey in the Chair. Pierre Auger was appointed ESRO's first Director General.\n\nAt the decision making level (the \"Legislative\" in the ESRO jargon), the supreme governing body was the Council, made of delegations from its Member States. Each member state had one vote in the Council, where it could be represented by not more than two delegates, one of whom was generally a scientist, the other an important national science administrator. One or more advisers were usually included national delegations. The main tasks of the Council were to determine the Organisation's scientific, technical and administrative policy; to approve its programme and annual work plans; and to determine its level of resources both annually, and every third year for the subsequent three-year period. The Council was advised by two subordinate bodies, the Administrative and Finance Committee (AFC) and the Scientific and Technical Committee (STC).\n\nAt the executive level, ESRO was managed by a Directorate based in Paris, including the Director General assisted by a Scientific Director, a Technical Director and a Head of Administration . The directors of ESRIN, ESDAC and ESLAB reported to the Scientific Director; the director of ESTEC, who had also responsibility for ESRANGE and ESTRACK, reported to the Technical Director. The \"Executive\", as it was eventually called, was responsible for the implementation of approved programmes within the established financial envelope and under general control from the Scientific and Technical Committee. It was also called to perform feasibility studies of space missions proposals coming from the scientific community and recommended by the STC, in view of their eventual adoption in the programme.\n\nOnly two years after the formation of ESRO, problems with its structure became painfully obvious. By mid-1966 it had climbed to 50%, placing enormous pressure on the operational programme. For this reason the Council set up a group of experts led by J.H. Bannier to investigate and solve the problem. Bannier quickly relieved the pressure on the AFC by raising the limit below which the Executive could award contracts without having to seek committee approval. He further increased the role of the Executive by transferring certain competencies from the Legislative to the Directorate. But this was only a stop-gap measure.\n\nBannier realised that the entire structure of ESOC had to be changed. Firstly, they were emphatic that the executive function of the organisation should be clearly separated from the policy and the planning function. Secondly, as far as the scientific programme was concerned, they recommended that there be a clear institutional distinction drawn between spacecraft development and spacecraft operation after launch. To achieve these objectives, the Bannier group suggested that ESRO's top management structure be completely changed. The dichotomy between scientific and technical directorates was, in Bannier's view, wrong in principle for an organisation like ESRO. To overcome it, he suggested that the two posts be abolished. In its stead a new structure was proposed. It comprised the Director General (DG) plus four directors, two of whom were essentially responsible for policy-making and two for policy execution. A new post was to be created in the first category, a so-called Director of Programmes and Planning (DPP), whose task it would be to prepare draft programmes of the Organisation, based on the scientific, technical, financial and time implications of the different proposals. The second member of the directorate concerned with forward planning would be the Director of Administration (DA) whose task it would be to prepare policy on the future needs of personnel, finance and contracts, and to organise and implement the necessary procedures to maintain an a posteriori control over the Organisation's functioning. The two posts in the Directorate having executive authority would be filled by the director of ESTEC and of ESDAC, which was to be renamed ESOC, the European Space Operations Centre. As for ESRIN, the Bannier group judged its research to be marginal to the major activities of the Organisation. Its director, they felt, should not be a member of the directorate but should rather report directly to the DG.\n\nThe European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) was to be a facility at the very core of ESRO. Its responsibilities included the engineering and testing of satellites and their payloads, the integration of scientific instruments in these payloads, and making arrangements for their launch. In some cases member states were to produce the scientific instruments for ESRO or produce them as part of their own national effort and compensate ESTEC for its service. In practise, national organisations simply used ESTEC as a service organisation and left it to pay for their efforts from the ESRO budget.\nAfter the Bannier Report the facility gained overall executive authority for spacecraft development and was merged with ESLAB. The satellite control centre was also moved to ESOC. ESTEC was originally to be located in Delft (Holland) but because of unforeseen difficulties, Noordwijk was chosen instead.\n\nThe situation with ESRO's laboratory, ESLAB was similar. It lacked the staff to function as an independent organisation. But this wasn't surprising since the ESRO Convention describes ESLAB's role in the following manner: \"...to undertake joint research programmes on the minimum scale deemed necessary by the Council [...] to complete or complement the scientific studies carried out in Member States.\"\n\nThis meant that ESLAB was little more than a venue for visiting scientists. ESLAB's role was later expanded. It acted as the interface between national scientific groups and ESTEC engineering groups as well as conducted its own research within the scope of the large astronomical satellite project. After the Bannier Report ESLAB was merged with ESTEC.\n\nIn 1964 ESRANGE was established as an ESRO sounding rocket launching range located in Kiruna (Sweden). This location was chosen because it was important to carry out a sounding rocket programme in the auroral zone, and essential that ESRO equip itself with a suitable range in the northern latitudes. Access to Kiruna was good by air, road and rail, and the launching range was relatively close to the town of Kiruna. Finally and perhaps decisively, ESRANGE could be located near Kiruna Geophysical Observatory (subsequently renamed the Swedish Institute of Space Physics). In 1972 ownership and operations of the range was transferred to the Swedish Space Corporation.\n\nSpace science data handling has two aspects. Firstly, it requires the setting up of a network of tracking and telemetry stations which can receive signals from spacecraft (ESTRACK). This network comprised four stations situated in the following locations:\n\nSecondly, it requires a central facility which edits and processes the information from the tracking network. The facilities at the centre, initially labelled ESDAC (European Space Data Acquisition Centre), were essentially a large mainframe computer or computers, which wAS made available both to its in-house staff and to visiting scientists and fellows who wished to use them to analyse and study the recovered data. ESDAC was later renamed ESOC, the European Space Operations Centre. ESOC is located in Darmstadt (Germany). After the Bannier Report it gained overall executive authority for spacecraft operation. ESOC's director also became responsible for ESRANGE and for ESTRACK.\n\nESLAR, a laboratory for advanced research was created in 1966 mainly to break the political deadlock over the location of ESLAB. Later renamed ESRIN, and acronym for European Space Research Institute, ESLAR was based in Frascati (Italy). The ESRO Convention describes ESRINs' role in the following manner: \"...to undertake laboratory and theoretical research in the basic physics and chemistry necessary to the understanding of past and the planning of future experiments in space.\" The facility began acquiring data from environmental satellites in the 1970s.\n\nESRO headquarters was home to the Executive arm of ESRO. After the Bannier Report it became responsible for policy, planning and \"a posteriori\" control.\n\nThe ESRO convention outlined the organisation as one which would be solely devoted to space science. As a consequence, scientific work was the main area of ESROs early operations. As the organisation and its capabilities matured it shifted from a strictly scientific programme to one where applicational activities played a more dominant role.\n\nThe fact that sounding rockets are relatively inexpensive, have a short lead time, provide a test bed for more ambitious project and have a low risk of failure made them an ideal first project for the newly formed European Space Research Organisation.\n\nThe first two ESRO sounding rockets were launches from the Salto di Quirra range in Sardinia on 6 and 8 July 1964. They released a payload of barium and ammonia into the ionosphere. The first launch from ESRANGE was made in November 1966. From this point onward the frequency of sounding rocket launches increased dramatically. The Norwegian base in Andøya was also used as a launch site.\n\nThe British Skylark (83) and French Centaure (64) were the main rockets utilised for the programme. The American Arcas (14), French Bélier (4) and Dragon (2), British Petrel (1) and German/Swiss Zenit (1) were also used. In total, the program oversaw the launch of 168 sounding rockets with an average success rate of 75%. During the course of the programme, the size and payload of the sounding rockets used by ESRO increased from 2.7 to 5.55 m (in length) and from 140 to 310 kg respectively.\n\nAbout half of the 168 sounding rockets were dedicated to ionospheric and auroral studies, about a quarter to atmospheric physics and the rest to solar, stellar and gamma-ray studies. While the number of launched rockets was lower than foreseen, the project exceeded expectations due to higher than anticipated payload capacity and longer range of the rockets.\n\nThe Blue Book foresaw the launching of 11 small satellites, 4 space probes, and 2 large satellites. These ambitions were never realized mainly due to financial troubles. The programme went through many revisions and in the end only a handful of projects produced concrete results. These were the two small, non-stabilised satellites ESRO I and ESRO II, launched in 1968 and renamed after launch Aurorae and Iris respectively; the two small highly eccentric orbit satellites HEOS-A and HEOS-A2, launched in 1968 and 1972 and then renamed HEOS-1 and HEOS-2; the medium size, stabilised satellite TD-1, launched in 1972; and the small satellite ESRO IV, also launched in 1972, which replaced the second satellite of the TD series (TD-2). All of these were multi-experiment satellites, i.e. the spacecraft carried a payload comprising several instruments provided by different research groups.\n\nThis was the name of a policy shift negotiated by ESRO members in 1971 which drastically reduced scientific funding in favor of application activities doubling the overall budget. This first lead to a change in the administrative structure and a 50% reduction of the scientific staff. Given the new budgetary environment, LPAC had to choose which two missions to fly among the five which had been planned thus far. It eventually chose HELOS, renamed Exosat, and the IMP-D, renamed ISEE-2, projects.\n\nThis new ESRO policy, negotiated in 1973, gave the organisation overall responsibility for the development of the European Ariane launcher. This task was entrusted to CNES. The second package deal enabled ESRO to enter into cooperation with NASA on the Spacelab project as well as manage the MAROTS maritime satellite navigation project. This agreement made funding easier and more flexible for the contributing nations which led to a doubling of the organisation's overall budget. ESRO also participated in the International Ultraviolet Explorer mission with NASA under these policy guidelines.\n\nThe first step towards a telecommunications program within ESRO was made in the end of 1966 when the European Conference on Satellite Communications requested that the organisation examine the potential for a European telecom satellite project. Although studies were carried out at this early stage as well as during the subsequent 5 years the ESRO council would not approve research and development activities until 1971 when the first package deal took effect. The delay was due to ESROs rigid decision making structure and the unfavorable political situation which existed among ESRO members at the time. These problems were largely done away with as part of the 1971 policy change which, among other things, outlined a fully voluntary mechanism for application project financing. Under the first package deal ESRO pursued a project to establish a European satellite system by the early 1980s in partnership with the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations and the European Broadcasting Union. ESRO merged with ELDO to form the European Space Agency in 1975 before the first satellite of the effort, the Orbital Test Satellite, would be successfully launched in 1978.\n\n"}
