It is a type of photosensitivity.\n\nThe skin response resembles an exaggerated sunburn. The involved chemical may enter into the skin by topical administration or it may reach the skin via systemic circulation following ingestion or parenteral administration. The chemical needs to be \"photoactive,\" which means that when it absorbs light, the absorbed energy produces molecular changes that cause toxicity. Many synthetic compounds, including drug substances like tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones, are known to cause these effects. Surface contact with some such chemicals causes photodermatitis; many plants cause phytophotodermatitis. Light-induced toxicity is a common phenomenon in humans; however, it also occurs in other animals.\n\nA phototoxic substance is a chemical compound which becomes toxic when exposed to light.\n\nPhototoxicity is a quantum chemical phenomenon. Phototoxins are molecules with a conjugated system, often an aromatic system. They have a low-lying excited state that can be reached by excitation with visible light photons. This state can undergo intersystem crossing with neighboring molecules in tissue, converting them to toxic free radicals. These rapidly attack nearby molecules, killing cells. A typical radical is singlet oxygen, produced from regular triplet oxygen. Because free radicals are highly reactive, the damage is limited to the body part illuminated.\n\n3T3 Neutral Red Phototoxicity Test – An in vitro toxicological assessment test used to determine the cytotoxic and photo(cyto)toxicity effect of a test article to murine fibroblasts in the presence or absence of UVA light.\n\"The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay (3T3 NRU PT) can be utilized to identify the phototoxic effect of a test substance induced by the combination of test substance and light and is based on the comparison of the cytotoxic effect of a test substance when tested after the exposure and in the absence of exposure to a non-cytotoxic dose of UVA/vis light. Cytotoxicity is expressed as a concentration-dependent reduction of the uptake of the vital dye - Neutral Red.\n\nSubstances that are phototoxic in vivo after systemic application and distribution to the skin, as well as compounds that could act as phototoxicants after topical application to the skin can be identified by the test. The reliability and relevance of the 3T3 NRU PT have been evaluated and has been shown to be predictive when compared with acute phototoxicity effects in vivo in animals and humans.\" Taken with permission from \nSeveral health authorities have issued related guidance documents, which need to be considered for drug development:\n\nWhen performing microscopy on live samples, one needs to be aware that too high light dose can damage or kill the specimens and lead to experimental artefacts. This is particularly important in confocal and superresolution microscopy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1943361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943361", "title": "Puffin Books", "text": "Puffin Books\n\nPuffin Books is a longstanding children's imprint of the British publishers Penguin Books. Since the 1960s, it has been among the largest publishers of children's books in the UK and much of the English-speaking world. The imprint now belongs to Penguin Random House, a subsidiary owned by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and the British publishing company Pearson plc.\n\nFour years after Penguin Books had been founded by Allen Lane, the idea for Puffin Books was hatched in 1939, when Noel Carrington, at the time an editor for \"Country Life\" books, met him and proposed a series of children's non-fiction picture books, inspired by the brightly coloured lithographed books mass-produced at the time for Soviet children. Lane saw the potential, and the first of the picture book series were published the following year. The name \"Puffin\" was a natural companion to the existing \"Penguin\" and \"Pelican\" books. Many continued to be reprinted right into the 1970s. A fiction list soon followed, when Puffin secured the paperback rights to Barbara Euphan Todd's 1936 story \"Worzel Gummidge\" and brought it out as the first Puffin story book in 1941.\n\nThe first Puffin editor, Eleanor Graham, saw the imprint through the 1940s and the struggles with paper rationing, and in the 1950s Puffin made its mark in fantasy with tales such as \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" by C. S. Lewis and \"Charlotte's Web\" by E. B. White. Some other notable titles whose paperback rights were acquired by Puffin included \"The Family from One End Street\" by Eve Garnett, which Puffin published in 1942, the \"Professor Branestawm\" books by Norman Hunter (1946), \"Ballet Shoes\" by Noel Streatfeild (1949), \"\" by Barbara Sleigh (1955), and \"The Silver Sword\" by Ian Serraillier (1960). Many different genres featured in the list, e.g. \"The Puffin Song Book\" (PS 100), 1956.\n\nIn 1961, Kaye Webb became Puffin's second editor, as a boom began in children's publishing, and in a decade the Puffin list grew from 151 titles when she took over to 1,213 in print by 1969. Puffin obtained the paperback rights to many of the best writers of the time, including Philippa Pearce, Rosemary Sutcliff, William Mayne, Alan Garner and Antonia Forest, all-time classics including \"Mary Poppins\", \"Dr Dolittle\" and \"The Hobbit\", and originals such as \"Stig of the Dump\" by Clive King. The books were promoted with flair through the Puffin Club, started by Kaye Webb in 1967 with the promise to Allen Lane that \"\"It will make children into book readers\"\". Though by 1987, it had become uneconomical and evolved into the schools-only Puffin Book Club, at its height the club had 200,000 subscribers and held regular Puffin Exhibitions, and its magazine \"Puffin Post\" appeared quarterly for many years, resuming publication in January 2009.\n\nColony Holidays (predecessor to ATE Superweeks) ran Children's Literature Summer Camps for members of the Puffin Book Club. Fifty or so children from all over Britain who loved reading would spend a ten-day holiday together, and popular children's authors such as Joan Aiken, Ian Serraillier and Clive King would spend a few days with them. Webb continued as editor until 1979, and the 1970s saw Puffin further advance its position with hits such as \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" by Roald Dahl and \"Watership Down\" by Richard Adams.\n\nThe range of Picture Puffins, introduced in the late 1960s for younger children, also developed rapidly. Eric Carle's \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" and Janet and Allan Ahlberg's \"Each Peach Pear Plum\" became and have remained firm children's favourites, as have Eric Hill's \"Spot the Dog\" and Jan Pienkowski's \"Meg and Mog\" books from the 1980s.\n\nThe 1980s saw Puffin taking full advantage of popular culture with film tie-in publishing, forming close links with Disney and other production companies. It was at this time that Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone introduced the concept of adventure gamebooks to Puffin which grew into the \"Fighting Fantasy\" phenomenon. The 1980s also saw the launch of the Puffin Plus line of young adult fiction, a market earlier catered for by the imprint Peacock Books. In 2010, the young adult line was relaunched as Razorbill.\n\nThe 1990s continued to see new writers join Puffin and in the 21st century the brand still shows heroes and heroines familiar with children such as Artemis Fowl, Percy Jackson, Max Gordon, Mildred Hubble and Scarlett, while stars such as Kylie Minogue and Madonna have written for Puffin.\n\n\"Puffin Post\" was a children's books magazine published by Puffin Books. It was launched in 1967 by Kaye Webb, editor of Puffin Books. It declined after Webb retired in 1982, but was relaunched in 2009 through the bookseller The Book People as a bi-monthly magazine. The magazine was discontinued again with the November 2012 issue.\n\nThe magazine contained a mix of stories, jokes, interviews, competitions and quizzes, and reader contributions. At its height, it had more than 200,000 readers. Prior to 1982, contributors to the magazine included well-known authors such as Alan Garner, Roald Dahl, Joan Aiken, Leon Garfield and Spike Milligan. After the 2009 re-launch, contributors included Charlie Higson, Cathy Cassidy and Michael Morpurgo.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1943362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943362", "title": "Jack Davis (playwright)", "text": "Jack Davis (playwright)\n\nJack Leonard Davis (11 March 1917 – 17 March 2000) was an Australian 20th-century Aboriginal playwright, poet and Indigenous activist. Academic Adam Shoemaker, who has covered much of Jack Davis‘ work and Aboriginal literature, has claimed he was one of “Australia’s most influential Aboriginal authors”. He was born in Perth, Western Australia, where he spent most of his life and later died. He identified with the Western Australian Nyoongah tribe, also spelt Noongar, and he included some of this language into his plays. In conjunction with Davis’ use of his native language, academics have inferred that his work includes themes of Aboriginality and Aboriginalism. These literary concepts are used to communicate the relationship between cultures.\n\nWhile known for his literary work, Jack Davis did not focus on writing until his fifties. His writing centred around the Aboriginal experience in relation to the settlement of white Australians. His collection of poems ‘\"The First Born’\" was his first work to be published and also made him the second Aboriginal to have published poetry by 1970, after Kath Walker, also known by her Aboriginal name Ooderoo Noonucca. He later focused his writing on plays, starting with \"Kullark,\" which was first performed in 1979. His plays were recognised internationally and were performed in Canada and England. His work and contribution was later recognised by the Order of the British Empire (BEM) in 1976, the Order of Australia Award in 1985 and two honorary doctorates from the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University. His work today is now included in many Australian school syllabuses for children to read and discuss.\n\nThe first five years of Jack Davis’ life were spent on a farm in Waroona, Western Australia with his ten siblings. His family then moved to Yarloop in 1923 after a bushfire destroyed their farm. Davis and his family were members of the Bibbulmun and Nyoongah tribe and spoke the Nyoongah language.\n\nHis mother, whose name is not on record and father, William Davis, also known as ‘Bill’, were both taken from their parents as they were considered by the government to be ‘half-castes’. Under the Australian policy passed in 1890, children who had both a full blood Aboriginal parent and a non-Aboriginal parent were considered half-castes. His parents went to work for white families and never acquired an education, making them illiterate. His mother was seven years old when she went to work for the Stretch family as a servant in Broome, Western Australia. His mother recalls that while they treated her well, she never felt part of the family. Her employers never educated his mother with their other children and she would be left to do domestic house work as they went to school. His father was eight years old when he went off to work, and took the surname of his boss ‘Davis’ because he did not like his father’s last name ‘Sung’ who was a Sikh man. Jack Davis’ father and mother met in Northam, Western Australia and were married soon after. During their marriage, they had six daughters and five sons.\n\nWilliam Davis worked mostly in the timber industry as a log chopper and found it hard to support eleven children on his income. However, his love of hunting and the bush allowed him to still provide meat for the family.\n\nJack Davis’ father died in 1933 after making his way home from a hunting accident. He was walking through a paddock in the early evening and was attacked by a bull. This left the family with no financial income, leading to the family selling up and moving out of Yarloop, a less remote area.\n\nAfter Jack Davis and his brother Harold went home to Yarloop after working at Moore River Native Settlement, his brother Harold went to fight in World War II.\n\nJack Davis attended school in Yarloop with his ten brothers and sisters. As a result of Davis’ father having Australian citizenship status, his children were allowed to get the same education as children with European heritage. His father’s citizenship status also meant his children were not forced to go to an Aboriginal settlement.\n\nIn early 1932, at age fourteen, Jack Davis and his brother Harold were offered work under false pretences at Moore River Native Settlement from the Chief Protector of Aboriginals who was a British man named Auber Neville. While his father was concerned about sending his sons to an Aboriginal settlement, the Great Depression put a financial strain on their family and work was scarce At Moore River Native Settlement, Aboriginals were to learn skills that would enable them to integrate better into white society\n\nThe two boys were to work on the farm in exchange for labour and farm skills, however, this turned out to be an empty promise that they discovered once they arrived. The settlement segregated white Australians and Aboriginals and prohibited the Aboriginals speaking their native languages. Davis and his brother were amongst four-hundred Aboriginals that were ‘offered’ work at the Moore River Native Settlement considered as a social measure by the government. While some aboriginals were forced to work, this was not the case for Jack Davis and his brother. After nine months, the two boys left to go back to Yarloop. Davis’ experience on the Moore River Native Settlement later shaped his literary work.\n\nDavis pursued many labour intensive jobs before he committed to writing, this included being a stockman, a horse trainer, a drover, a mill worker, a driver in various methods of transportation and a kangaroo hunter. In 1970, at the time of publishing his first collection of poems \"The First Born,\" he dedicated himself to literature. He became the Manager of the Aboriginal Advancement Council Centre in Perth from 1969 -1973. He then transitioned into becoming an editor at the Aboriginal Publications Foundation from 1973 to 1979 which published a periodical magazine called ‘Identity’ that focused on recognising Aboriginal literature.\n\nJack Davis began his writing career by publishing a collection of poems called \"The First Born\" in 1970. He later published his second collection of poetry called \"Jagardoo\" in 1978. After publishing two collections of poetry, he began to focus on playwriting, publishing a total of five plays and two children's plays:\n\nPlays:\n\n·      \"Kullark\" 1979,\n\n·     \"The Dreamers\" 1981,\n\n·     \"No Sugar\" 1985,\n\n·     \"Barungin 1989\",\n\n·     \"In Our Town\" 1990,\n\nChildren’s plays:\n\n·      \"Honey Spot\" 1987\n\n·      \"Moorli and the Leprechaun\" 1994.\n\nDavis also wrote a monodrama called \"Wahngin Country,\" however, he never finished it. Academic Bob Hodge, who wrote the peer reviewed journal ‘\"Jack Davis and the Emergence of Aboriginal Writing’\" in 1994 stated Davis was interested in ‘White History’ and how it omitted the Aboriginal history and their perspective.\n\nAccording to Academics, Jack Davis wanted to offer an alternative narrative that included the Aboriginal story. Davis found the most effective format was through transforming the Indigenous tradition of oral story telling into written plays and performance Themes in his work encapsulate the history and discrimination of Aboriginal people,  including the first contact with white settlers. Academic Adam Shoemaker, has described his work as always alluding to the history of Aboriginals even when his plays are not mentioning the past.\n\nDavis’ play \"Kullark,\" translated to ‘home’ is often considered by academics as a documentary, detailing the beginning of White settlement in Western Australia in 1829.\n\n\"Kullark,\" published in 1979 translates to ‘home’ in the Nyoongha language. The meaning of the play Is interpreted by academics as a protest, criticising the colonial recorded history of the 1829 white settlement in Western Australia.\n\nThe play documents the history and first contact between Aboriginals and white settlers from the authors perspective using an Aboriginal family that have been effected by the history Davis is attempting to divulge. Davis uses a chronological and documentary like structure to present the play. He includes details such as the white settlers trading poisoned white flour and the massacres at Pinjarra in 1834. Academics have inferred that Davis includes the details of these events to give Aboriginal people a voice and a known history that have been previously omitted. \"Kullark\" was Davis’ first play to begin that journey of historical story telling\n\nThe Dreamers\n\nThe Dreamers was first performed in 1972 and published in 1981. The play centres its' narrative around the memory of three Aboriginal men who worked at Moore River Native Settlement. Davis wrote that he aimed to confront white and black audiences with a truthful and uncompromising picture of urban Aboriginal life.\n\nDavis’ play \"No Sugar\" was first published in 1986 and achieved great acclaim; receiving the Australian writers Guild Award (AWGIE) for best stage play, the year it was published. The play was set in the 1930s during the Great Depression and tells the story of an Aboriginal family that is removed from their home and forced to work on the Moore River Native Settlement. An article by the Sydney Morning Herald writes that the play is a rejection of white assimilation and the degradation of Aboriginal lives and culture. The Play includes many references of the Nyoongha language. Academics such as Bob Hodge consider this an attempt to validate the importance of Aboriginal culture, while also communicating the feelings of isolation when people cannot understand their own language and cultural customs.\n\n\"No Sugar\" is currently in the Victorian High School Syllabus for students who are in the English as an Additional Language (EAL) course for the Higher School Certificate (HSC). However, as mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald, there is debate over whether the themes and inclusion of the Nyoongah language are too complex for students who are trying to learn the fundamentals of the English.\n\nDavis’ play Barungin was published in 1989 and translates to ‘Smell the Wind’ in the Nyoongha language. The play focuses on the high incarceration rate of Aboriginals and the large number of deaths of Aboriginals in custody. During the year the play was published, Aboriginals accounted to ten percent of the national average of people in jail. Furthermore, the play is set in Western Australia where the incarceration rate of Aboriginals was thirty-five percent.\n\nAcademics refer to the concepts Aboriginality and Aboriginalism when analysing Davis’ work. According to academics, Davis's work encapsulates these themes by constructing Western thought in his work and using the Nyoongah native language as a form of Aboriginal empowerment.\n\nAcademic Bob Hodge, states that Aboriginalism is much like Orientalism, where White society sees those of different race and  culture as 'the other'. The concept is portrayed as white society needing to fix those cultural differences, which is referenced in Davis’ plays. Academics have said that Davis and other Aboriginal writers such as Ooderoo Noonuccal from the sixties and seventies used literature as a form of activism against these ideals and as a powerful form of communication to write their own history.\n\nAboriginality encompasses the response to Aboriginalism and the reaction of Indigenous writers in reclaiming their culture and history. It is seen as a protest against white imperialism and assimilation policies that dominated the beginning of white settlement in Australia. The concept, Aboriginality, within literature also includes proposals of how both white and Indigenous people can move forward. This concept was introduced in the 1960’s when Aboriginal literature was first published, proposing a new way forward.\n\nAcademics have analysed Davis’ work through the lens of Aboriginality as he uses the Western form of communication to connect to a white audience. Plays are seen as a Western form of communication, as Aboriginal history has revealed that Indigenous Australians told stories through oral communication, more commonly known as ‘Dreamtime’ By including these Aboriginal overtones, academics believe he is trying to show a white audience another form of history through a communication method they know. \"Kullark,\" Davis’ first play in 1979 is used as an example by academics to show that Davis is confronting the issue of Aboriginalism Davis provides a historical and chronological account in \"Kullark\" including Aboriginals where they previously were not. According to academics, Davis believed that white historians were unwilling to write the Aboriginal history and this, he felt, was necessary to record Aboriginal history in the Western way. His purpose for writing  was for people to know Aboriginals were omitted from white history, and to then provide the Aboriginal account. His goal, however, was for future generations to reflect and read history which included both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. Aboriginality encompasses the response and reaction of Indigenous writers in reclaiming their culture and history. It is seen as a protest against white imperialism and assimilation policies that dominated the beginning of white settlement in Australia. The concept 'Aboriginality' within literature also includes proposals of how both white and Indigenous people can move forward.\n\nAccording to academics the theme of survival is reoccurring in Davis’ work as it refers to the first settlement of white people and the long battle Aboriginal people have had to fight for their existence, land, culture, history and rights. Academics reveal the empowerment that Aboriginals feel when they see themselves on the stage acting in Davis’s plays, symbolising their ability to reclaim their sense of worth \n\nDavis’ life and history was a driving force and influence on his literary work. Davis’s experience on Moore River Native Settlement has shaped both his play \"Kullark\", \"No Sugar\" and \"The Dreamers.\" In Davis’ play \"No Sugar\" he recreates the experience using different characters and detailing the large quantity of Aboriginals taken to Moore River Native Settlement Similarly, the Western Australian ‘Protector of Aboriginals’ A.O Neville who sent Davis and his bother to the Moore River Native Settlement features in his plays \"Kullark, No Sugar\" and \"The Dreamers.\" Davis uses Neville’s speeches in his plays to portray the government’s perspective on Aboriginals. Additionally, According to academics,  Davis tries to demonstrate how the government believed they were doing the right thing for Aboriginal people but neglected to see the Aboriginal perspective and the pain and suffering that was the result. Academics infer that Davis evokes an understanding of the European mindset, yet shows how that attitude also shaped the way Aboriginal people see themselves. According to academics, Davis’ plays were not meant to be a place of conflict or a vent of anger but a place of clarity, empowerment and understanding.\n\nHis childhood in Yarloop has been featured in his poetry His poem ‘Magpie’ was influenced by his walk home from school through the jarrah forests and the wild life \n\n\"“Magpie, Magpie,\"\n\n\"Jaunty walk, cheeky eye,\"\n\n\"You don’t seem to have an enemy,\"\n\n\"I don’t know why.\"\n\n\"Especially you, Mr Male,\"\n\n\"With your elegant dress,\"\n\n\"And your black and white tail.\"\n\n\"I have seen you beat your mate\"\n\n\"And make her squark as you berate,\"\n\n\"Striding, running over my lawn,\"\n\n\"Chattering in the early dawn,\"\n\n\"As if you own that too.\"\n\n\"On Second thoughts, as far as birds go\"\n\n\"And what do they know,\"\n\n\"You believe in land rights too!\"\" \n\nHe wrote another poem about his experience of making his own bow and arrow and killing a robin redbreast which he felt great remorse for.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are also known as WaRP (as in Warp Graphics).\n\nWendy Fletcher was born in San Francisco in 1951, and from an early age demonstrated the talents later to come to fruition as a professional illustrator, and eventually as the creator of \"Elfquest\".\n\nWendy's youthful interest in fantasy was inspired in part by such luminaries as Shakespeare and Kipling. She took artistic inspiration from Victorian illustrators such as Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac, designers such as Walt Disney, Doug Wildey, and Erté, as well as comic book greats such as Jack Kirby and Japanese manga artist Osamu Tezuka.\n\nRichard Pini was born in 1950, in New Haven, Connecticut. After an exemplary academic performance at school, he was accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for an astrophysics degree. Always a fan of science fiction, at college he found a new diversion in comic books.\n\nWendy Fletcher and Richard Pini met when Pini read a letter of Fletcher's that had been published in issue #5 of the \"Silver Surfer\" comic book. A correspondence began, spanning a period of four years. The two eventually married in 1972, and Wendy embarked upon a career as an illustrator for sci-fi magazines. A degree in astronomy from MIT led Richard to a position at Boston's Charles Hayden Planetarium as lecturer, photographer, script writer and special effects technician. Later, he taught high school astronomy, then worked for IBM until \"Elfquest\" became a full-time occupation.\n\nFletcher contributed several covers and illustrations to \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" and \"Galileo\" magazines in the mid-1970s. Prior to the widespread publication of \"Elfquest\", Wendy was also known for dressing up at comic book conventions as Red Sonja.\n\n\"Elfquest\", a fantasy story about a community of elves, was launched in 1978 with art and co-writing by Wendy Pini. Richard Pini, who had been working for IBM, is credited as co-writer and editor on \"Elfquest\", as well as handling all of the publishing and business aspects of Warp Graphics.\n\nWendy Pini wrote a book documenting her attempt to make an animated film project of the \"Stormbringer\" series. \"Law and Chaos: The \"Stormbringer\" Animated Film Project\" was published by Father Tree Press (an imprint of the Pinis' WaRP Graphics) in 1987. The book contains original artwork, information on the characters, an overview of the plot, and Wendy Pini's personal investment in the project. The film never reached completion. However, the full content of \"Law and Chaos\" may be found on the Masque of the Red Death web site.\n\nIn 2007, Wendy Pini turned her attention to a new project unrelated to \"Elfquest.\" Taking the Edgar Allan Poe short story \"Masque of the Red Death\" as a starting point, she adapted the tale into both graphic novel and web comic formats, giving it a futuristic, dystopic slant.\n\nIn addition to \"Elfquest\", Wendy Pini also created two graphic novels based on the TV series \"Beauty and the Beast\" and has illustrated occasional stories for both Marvel Comics and DC Comics. She wrote an introduction to the first volume of the \"Gargoyles\" trade paperback and mentions being a fan of the show.\n\n\nCharacters based on Richard and Wendy Pini appear in \"Ghost Rider\" volume 1, #14 (Oct. 1975), as well as issues #15, #17, #18, and #19, which were written by Tony Isabella. Richard is a special effects technician and props arranger for a Hollywood movie studio, and Wendy is a costume designer.\n\n\"Elfquest\" and Wendy Pini are both referenced in Marvel's \"Uncanny X-Men\" #153 (January 1982), \"Kitty's Fairy Tale\", written by Chris Claremont.

The core of the text may date to the mid-7th century, but much material was added between that date and the production of the earliest surviving copy in the 12th century.\n\nIf it indeed dates to the 7th century, the text is the first instance of a defence of vernaculars, defending the spoken Irish language over Latin, predating Dante's \"De vulgari eloquentia\" by 600 years and Chernorizets Hrabar's \"O pismeneh\" by 200 years.\n\n\nThe Auraicept consists of four books,\n\nThe author argues from a comparison of Gaelic grammar with the materials used in the constructions of the Tower of Babel:\n\nOthers affirm that in the tower there were only nine materials and that these were clay and water, wool and blood, wood and lime, pitch, linen, and bitumen ...

As pointed out by Eco (1993), Gaelic was thus argued to be the only instance of a language that overcame the confusion of tongues, being the first language that was created after the fall of the tower by the seventy-two wise men of the school of Fenius, choosing all that was best in each language to implement in Irish. Calder notes (p. xxxii) that the poetic list of the \"72 races\" was taken from a poem by Luccreth moccu Chiara.\n\nThe \"Auraicept\" is one of the three main sources of the manuscript tradition about Ogham, the others being \"In Lebor Ogaim\" and \"De dúilib feda na forfed\". A copy of \"In Lebor Ogaim\" immediately precedes the \"Auraincept\" in the Book of Ballymote, but instead of the \"Bríatharogam Con Culainn\" given in other copies, there follows a variety of other \"secret\" modes of ogham. The Younger Futhark are also included, as\" ogam lochlannach\" \"ogham of the Norsemen\".\n\nSimilar to the argument of the precedence of the Gaelic language, the \"Auraicept\" claims that Fenius Farsaidh discovered four alphabets, the Hebrew, Greek and Latin ones, and finally the ogham, and that the ogham is the most perfected because it was discovered last. The text is the origin of the tradition that the ogham letters were named after trees, but it gives as an alternative possibility that the letters are named for the 25 members of Fenius' school.\n\nIn the translation of Calder (1917),\n\nThis is their number: five Oghmic groups, i.e., five men for each group, and one up to five for each of them, that their signs may be distinguished. These are their signs: right of stem, left of stem, athwart of stem, through stem, about stem. Thus is a tree climbed, to wit, treading on the root of the tree first with thy right hand first and thy left hand after. Then with the stem, and against it and through it and about it. (Lines 947-951)\n\nIn the translation of McManus:\n\nThis is their number: there are five groups of ogham and each group has five letters and each of them has from one to five scores and their orientations distinguish them. Their orientations are: right of the stemline, left of the stemline, across the stemline, through the stemline, around the stemline. Ogham is climbed as a tree is climbed\n\n\n"}

It was illustrated with drawings by Marjorie-Ann Watts and published by Faber and Faber in 1958. The first paperback edition, from Puffin Books in 1964, is catalogued by the Library of Congress as revised.\n\nMarianne is a young girl who is bedridden with a long-term illness. She draws a picture to fill her time, and finds that she spends her dreams within the picture she has drawn. As time goes by, she becomes sicker, and starts to spend more and more time trapped within her fantasy world, and her attempts to make things better by adding to and crossing out things in the drawing make things progressively worse. Her only companion in her dreamworld is a boy called Mark, who is also a long-term invalid in the real world.\n\nCatherine Storr's later novel \"Marianne and Mark\" was a sequel to \"Marianne Dreams\".\n\n\"Marianne Dreams\" has been the basis of several film, TV and radio adaptations, including the 1972 British ITV children's TV series \"Escape Into Night\" (which was quite faithful to the novel), and the movie \"Paperhouse\" (which was less so). The author adapted it herself as an opera libretto in 1999: the first performance of the opera \"Marianne Dreams\" took place in 2004 with music by the British composer Andrew Lowe Watson.

The plan was formed by Commander Ian Fleming of the Naval Intelligence Division (NID). No German takeover of Spain took place, nor an invasion of Gibraltar, and the plan was shelved in 1943. Fleming later used the name for his Jamaican home where he wrote the James Bond stories.\n\nThe aim of the operation was to ensure that Britain could continue to communicate with Gibraltar if Spain joined, or was invaded by, the Axis powers, and to carry out limited sabotage. In August 1940, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming of the NID was assigned the responsibility for drawing up the plan. Of particular concern to Fleming was the possible installation of Axis radar equipment and infrared cameras in the Strait of Gibraltar, which would have been a threat to the Navy's Mediterranean strategy and to Allied shipping interests in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nUnder cover of a courier's passport Fleming travelled to Gibraltar on 16 February 1941. On his arrival, he liaised closely with Alan Hillgarth, the British naval attaché in Madrid. Hillgarth provided much of the background to the plan for the guerrilla campaign and sabotage that would follow German presence on the Iberian peninsula. Fleming's presence in Gibraltar was primarily to set up a secure cipher link between London and the Goldeneye liaison office, the latter under the control of H.L. Greensleeves, an NID agent. A Tangier office was also set up by Fleming to assume the activities of the Gibraltar office should the Germans occupy Gibraltar. During the course of his visit, Fleming also met with William J. Donovan from the American Office of Strategic Services, who was on a fact-finding tour. Fleming returned to London on 26 February 1941.\n\nA precursor to visiting the US, Fleming discussed Goldeneye with the various intelligence organisations in Lisbon on 20 May 1941, to ensure their smooth coordinated operations. He also undertook an assessment of the facilities and equipment for Goldeneye. He suggested that an Anglo-American Intelligence Committee be set up to coordinate the gathering and evaluating of intelligence from North Africa and the Iberian peninsula.\n\nIn 1942 Goldeneye moved into a state of alert prior to the implementation of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, to monitor and counter the stepped up surveillance and sabotage activities by the Axis powers who suspected that some type of military action would occur in the Mediterranean area. The 10th Light Flotilla, an elite unit of Italian navy frogmen, would use wrecked ships in Gibraltar to launch attacks on Allied shipping.\n\nThe reduced risk of Nazi occupation of Spain brought about the shutdown of Goldeneye in August 1943, along with the associated plan, Operation Tracer.\n\nFleming later dubbed his Jamaican estate \"Goldeneye\", and began writing his series of James Bond novels there. The name was also used for the title of the seventeenth James Bond film, \"GoldenEye\" starring Pierce Brosnan as Bond.\n\nNotes\nReferences\n"}

Cartoons.\n\nLava's music was markedly different from that of Franklyn and previous composer Carl Stalling, with a tendency towards atonality. A sense of tension is often created in Lava's scores using sequences based on the notes of the diminished seventh chord.\n\nLava also composed and sang the theme to the TV western series \"Cheyenne\" and composed the original theme from \"Gunsmoke\".\n\nLava was educated at Von Humboldt Grammar School and Lane Tech High School in Chicago, then attended Northwestern University where his major was journalism. He studied conducting with Albert Coates in Los Angeles. Lava also wrote short stories for various magazines and was the editor of \"Northwestern Commerce Magazine\" and associate editor of \"Purple Parrot.\".\n\nArriving in Hollywood in 1936, Lava arranged for musical radio programs, then scored a number of serials such as \"Zorro's Fighting Legion\" and motion pictures, such as \"The Painted Stallion\"; \"A Boy and His Dog\"; \"Embraceable You\"; \"Dangerously They Live\"; \"The Hidden Hand\"; \"I Won't Play\"; \"Star in the Night\" and \"Hitler Lives.\" He was also responsible for scores for the Warner Bros.' \"Joe McDoakes\" short subjects and Republic serials. Among his compositions during this era were \"The Moonrise Song (It Just Dawned On Me).\"\n\nWalt Disney Productions hired Lava in the mid-1950s, where he wrote or co-wrote the incidental music for \"Zorro\" and the Spin and Marty and Hardy Boys segments of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". While he was later best known for cartoon music, Lava did not score any cartoons at Disney, though he is credited with the score for 1955's TV segment \"The Story of the Silly Symphony\".\n\nOn his arrival at the Warner Bros.' cartoon studio, Lava's first assignment was the Tweety cartoon \"The Jet Cage.\" Franklyn had scored the first two minutes of the cartoon when he died suddenly of a heart attack; though Lava completed the cartoon, Franklyn was credited with the entire score. Franklyn used strings and flutes in his portion, arranged similarly to his earlier cartoons, while Lava's score sounds more mechanical and less orchestrated, with a xylophone at one point. Lava's first credited cartoon is \"Good Noose\", also released in 1962. Although Lava's previous work also sounded mechanical, it was greatly enhanced by the studio orchestra. However, at the time of his arrival, Warner Bros. reduced, and later dismantled, the full-time studio orchestra. Without the music budget that he was accustomed to, Lava was forced to work with a much smaller orchestra to record his scores.\n\nLava was responsible for many scores, including those heard in thirteen 1965 and 1966 Road Runner cartoons, subcontracted by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to Format Films. The budgets for these cartoons were even tighter still, meaning that only the first three of the thirteen (\"The Wild Chase\", \"Rushing Roulette\" and \"Run, Run, Sweet Road Runner\") had real scored music. The other ten (from \"Tired and Feathered\" to \"Clippety Clobbered\") used a set of generic musical cues, which did not follow the action closely as scores did in other Warner Brothers productions. The first WB short he scored (partially) was \"The Jet Cage\", after Milt Franklyn died in the middle of scoring it. His first full score was for the Daffy short \"Good Noose\".\n\nHe also composed music for 19 of the 124 Pink Panther cartoons (USA, 1964, animation), always based on Henry Mancini's original theme, adapting it to closely follow character action. Walter Greene scored the nineteenth cartoon, \"Pink, Plunk, Plink\", however Lava scored the following one, \"Smile Pretty, Say Pink\". Greene scored all the following shorts (excluding \"Extinct Pink\", composed by Doug Goodwin, who was known for his music for other DePatie-Freleng shorts series such as \"The Ant and the Aardvark\" and \"Roland and Rattfink\") until \"Therapeutic Pink\". Following this, the remaining shorts would be aired on television as part of \"The All New Pink Panther Show\" (although they would be rereleased theatrically), where all shorts utilized music cues composed by Steve DePatie (son of series co-producer David H. DePatie). Starting with \"Congratulations It's Pink\" and ending with \"Therapeutic Pink\", both Greene's and Lava's music were utilized in the cartoons. He earned the 1964 Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short, \" Pink Phink \" and he co-authored the music for the movie \" PT-109 \". He also composed music for \" The Battle of Britain \" and the documentary \" Hitler Lives \". \n\nLava co-wrote the theme (with Irving Taylor) and most of the incidental music for the TV series \"F Troop\". Lava also composed the silent-film music for the \"bookend\" sequences at the beginning and end of the 1961 \"Twilight Zone\" episode \"Once Upon a Time\".\n\nLava was also employed as Music Supervisor with David Rose in a couple of seasons of \"Bonanza\".\n\nAlthough Lava's feature film work was not as prolific, he composed the scores to movies such as \"Chamber of Horrors\" (1966), \"Chubasco\" (1968), \"In Enemy Country\" (1968), \"Assignment to Kill\" (1968), \"The Good Guys and the Bad Guys\" (1969) and \"Dracula vs. Frankenstein\" (1971).\n\nWilliam Lava was the son of Abraham Lava(1882-1958) and Rose Chernavsky(1886-1938). He married Lenore Goldman on December 31, 1932 in Chicago, Illinois. They had two daughters, Charmaine(1938-2012) and Rochelle Lava(1939-1997).\n\nA staunch anti-communist, Lava became known as an outspoken critic of the Cuban Revolution. He spoke in favor of direct military action against the Castro regime, continuing to protest in this manner from 1959 until his death.\n\n"}

It covers literary works of fiction, such as novels, short stories, plays and poems. It also includes non-fiction works, both scholarly and targeted at the general reader, such as dissertations, journal or magazine articles, books and even web-based content. Although Singapore lacks a dedicated gay book publisher or gay bookshop, it does have at least one dedicated gay library, Pelangi Pride Centre, which is open weekly to the public. Many of the works cited here may be found both in Pelangi Pride Centre, as well as the National Library or other academic libraries in Singapore, as well as in some commercial bookshops under 'gender studies' sections.\n\nThe increasing boldness of Singapore writers in sympathetically addressing LGBT themes is intertwined with the growth of English-language theatre from the mid-1980s. It was in theatre that writers first challenged the cultural taboo surrounding homosexuality. A fairly regular stream of gay plays were staged in Singapore throughout the 1990s, raising the public profile of sexual minorities.\n\nNovels with LGBT-related themes began emerging in Singapore literature scene in the 1990s. Among the earliest work is Different Strokes (1993) by David Leo portraying victims of AIDS. \n\nLGBT-themed stories are found in different collections of short stories. Examples are:\n\nCyril Wong came out into the scene in 2000 with poetry that was confessional in style but universal in scope. Completely \"out\" in newspaper and magazine interviews, he is the first and only openly gay poet to win the National Arts Council's Young Artist Award for Literature and the Singapore Literature Prize. His poetry collections are published by Firstfruits, Ethos Books and Math Paper Press in Singapore:\n\nAlvin Pang's \"The Scent of the Real\", which refers to Cyril Wong, is value-neutral and mentions Cyril Wong's sexuality as a fact, not as something disgusting or abject.\n\nToh Hsien Min and Yong Shu Hoong have written poems about friends coming out to them in \"On a Good Friend's Admission that he is Gay\" and \"A Friend's Confession\". Both were suspicious that their friends wanted sexual relations with them.\n\nGwee Li Sui in the eponymous book with the poem \"Who wants to buy a book of Poems\" refers to the stereotype used on poets as limp-wristed and \"ah kua\".

{"id": "1943428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943428", "title": "Net migration rate", "text": "Net migration rate\n\nThe net migration rate is the difference between the number of immigrants (people coming into an area) and the number of emigrants (people leaving an area) throughout the year. When the number of immigrants is larger than the number of emigrants, a positive net migration rate occurs. A positive net migration rates indicates that there are more people entering than leaving an area. When more emigrate from a country, the result is a negative net migration rate, meaning that more people are leaving than entering the area. When there is an equal number of immigrants and emigrants, the net migration rate is balanced.\n\nThe net migration rate is calculated over a one-year period using the mid year population and a ratio.\n\nMigration occurs over a series of different push and pull factors that revolve around social, political, economical, and environmental factors according to \"Migration Trends\". Social migration is when an individual migrates to have a higher standard of living, to be closer to family or to live in a nation with which they identify more. Political migration then is when a person is going in as a refugee to escape war or political persecution. This form of migration is also can also be called forced migration. This happens when refugees are moving to neighboring countries or more developed countries. Neighboring countries, especially the ones in the middle east are depended on to shelter the refugees. Just like the United States, many of the more wealthy countries are now the hosts to many of these refugees. Economical migration is moving to a place where one can aspire to have a career and better job opportunities which end up contributing to better living conditions. Lastly, environmental migration is when natural disasters force you to move into a new area. Once we analyze all of the migrating factors we can get to the idea that the net migration rate can tell us so much about a country. For example, if there are a lot of people coming in and not many leaving we can assume it is a wealthy country that keeps evolving and generating more and more opportunities. On the other hand, if not many people are coming in and many are leaving it is easy to assume that there is a chance of violence, low economy, or not enough resources to fulfill the existing population.\n\nN = (I - E) / M X 1,000\n\nN = Net Migration Rate\n\nI = Number of Immigrants Entering the Area\n\nE = Number of Emigrants Leaving the Area\n\nM = Mid Year Population\n\nAt the start of the year, country A had a population of 1,000,000. Throughout the year there was a total of 200,000 people that immigrated to (entered) country A, and 100,000 people that emigrated from (left) country A. Throughout the year there was a total of 100,000 births and 100,000 deaths. What is the net migration rate?\n\nFirst, find the mid year population for country A.\n\nM = [ Population at Start of Year + Population at End of Year ] / 2\n\nM = [ 1,000,000 + (1,000,000 + 200,000 - 100,000) ] / 2\n\nM = [ 1,000,000 + 1,100,000 ] / 2\n\nM = 2,100,000 / 2\n\nM = 1,050,000\n\nThe mid year population for country A is 1,050,000.\n\nSecond, find the net migration for country A and please keep in mind this is simply the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants, not the actual rate.\n\nI - E = 200,000 - 100,000\n\nI - E = 100,000\n\nThe net migration for country A is 100,000.\n\nThird, plug your findings into the formula to find the net migration rate for country A.\n\nN = (I - E) / M X 1,000\n\nN = 100,000 / 1,050,000 X 1,000\n\nN = 95.23809523809524\n\nN = 95.2\n\nThe net migration rate for country A is 95.2 per 1,000 people. This means that for every 1,000 people in country A at the beginning of the year, 95.2 will have immigrated to country A by the end of the year. This number numerically shows the impact of migration on the country's population and allows for the comparison of country A's net migration rate to other country's net migration rate.\n\nNet migration has a major key role in every single country. Like mentioned before if a country has a high migration rate is it seen as wealthy and developed. In contrast a country with a low rate is seen as undeveloped, having political problems, and lacking resources its citizens need. Every country needs a stable number of people going in and out of their territory in order to have a stable economy. If the number of people coming in is greater than the number of people leaving, there will be a greater demand of resources and a tighter yet growing economy. On the other hand, a country with a lower migration rate will most likely lose many of its available resources due to a lack of consumerism and production. Conflicts can arise due to migration, but people can still find it easier than ever to move to a different place. This can be due to more advance technology and being able to communicate and have more efficient forms of transportation. All of this creates more opportunities which then increases the amount of net migration. The United States is an example of a country with growing opportunities as migration increases. Other occurring problems caused by net migration is a rise in the dependency ratio, higher demand on government resources, and public congestion. A high dependency ratio can be a factor caused by net migration. The dependency ratio can increase as the elder population increases and the fertility rate decreases. This results in a decrease in the labor force and this can hurt a countries economy by causing it to slow down. In order to slow down this process countries have many things things like increasing the retirement age in order to keep the elderly involved in the work force as much as possible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1943434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943434", "title": "Currency sign (typography)", "text": "Currency sign (typography)\n\nThe currency sign is a character used to denote an unspecified currency. It can be described as a circle the size of a lowercase character with four short radiating arms at 45° (NE), 135° (SE), 225° (SW) and 315° (NW). It is raised slightly above the baseline. The character is sometimes called \"scarab\".\n\nThe symbol was first encoded for computers in 1972, as a place-holder for national currency symbols such as the dollar sign, in national variants (ISO 646) of ASCII and the International Reference Variant. It was proposed by Italy as an alternative (to the dollar sign) at 0x34. In reality, most national standards retained the dollar sign as too important. (ASCII and ISO646 were specified for 7-bit encoding, which allowed for just 96 printable characters (and 32 control codes).\n\nThe introduction of 8-bit encoding and the ISO/IEC 8859 code pages meant that all major national currency symbols could be accommodated. When ISO 8859 was standardized, it was placed at 0xA4 in the Latin, Arabic and Hebrew character sets. There was not room for it in the Cyrillic set, it having been sacrificed for the section sign (§), and it was not included in all later added Latin sets. In Soviet computer systems (usually using some variant of KOI character set) this symbol was placed at the code point used by the dollar sign in ASCII. Latin 9 replaced it with the euro sign, , but this standard failed to gain significant acceptance given the dominance of Microsoft's Windows-1252 code page. In the modern era, the Unicode standard gives each of the two symbols its own unique code point across all platforms.\n\nWhen it is appropriately used, for example ¤12.50 can be interpreted as 12.5 units of \"some currency\", but the currency itself is unknown, and can be determined only by information outside the use of the character in itself. Such dependence on context is called deixis. Widely used other words (for example \"I, here, now\") also have a meaning depending on context. \n\nIn international text-based discourse, such as international trading or listing exchange rates, it is typical to refer to a given currency with its three-letter ISO 4217 code instead of or in conjunction with a currency symbol, to avoid ambiguity. Historic practice of using the same code point for different national currency symbols can be problematic in international communication. If, for example, an amount of £100 is written in an e-mail or on a website, and the software does not make sure that the same character set is used at both ends, it could be interpreted e.g. as ¥100, which is a much lower value than £100. Since Unicode and UTF-8 (and UTF-16) encodings became the norm since the early 21st century, this problem is essentially of historical interest.\n\nIt is represented in Unicode as \n\nToday (2016), the symbol is available on some keyboard layouts, for example French, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian.\n\nOtherwise it may be typed\n\nThe currency sign was once a part of the Mac OS Roman character set, but Apple changed the symbol at that code point to the euro sign in Mac OS 8.5. (In pre-Unicode) Windows character sets (Windows-1252), the generic currency sign was retained at 0xA4 and the euro sign was introduced as a new code point, at 0x80 in the little used (by Microsoft) control-code space 0x80 to 0x9F. \n\n"}

She was also the niece and heir of childless Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini, Prince of Taranto. Her maternal grandmother, Mary of Enghien, was queen consort of Naples from 1406 until 1414. \n\nOn 30 May 1444/1445, Isabella married Ferdinand of Aragon, then Duke of Calabria (1423–1494), natural son of Alfonso V of Aragon who had recently conquered the Neapolitan kingdom from French Angevins, and thus was the new liege lord of Isabella and her family. Alfonso arranged this marriage in order to give a good future to his favorite bastard son, by giving him his own principality by marriage. Also, Alfonso wanted his loyal people (such as his own son) to have feudal fiefs in his new kingdom, which would happen in the future as soon as Ferdinand and Isabella succeeded in Taranto. The marriage also strengthened the king's grip on the current lords of Taranto.\n\nOn 27 June 1458 Isabella's husband became, by the will of his father, king of Naples. Isabella became queen. They no longer wanted to make Taranto their principal holding, but it was still a strong possession, and in 1463 Isabella succeeded her uncle Giovanni Antonio as princess of Taranto.\n\nQueen Isabella died on 30 March 1465, and was buried in San Pietro Martire. Her heir was her eldest son, the future King Alfonso II of Naples.\n\nIsabella had six children with Ferdinand:\n"}

Fenerbahçe also won the Club World Championship as the first Turkish club ever in 2010. Turkey Women's National Basketball team won the silver medal in the European Championship in 2011 while the Women's National Volleyball Team reached the 6th place in the World Championship in 2010 and won a bronze medal in European Championship in 2011.\n\nTurkish athletes recently achieved success in European level; Elvan Abeylegesse winning gold medal in Women's 10000 metres and silver in Women's 5000 metres, Alemitu Bekele winning gold medal in Women's 5000 metres and Nevin Yanıt winning gold medal in Women's 100 metres Hurdl in 2010 European Championship. In 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships Kemal Koyuncu won silver in Men's 1500 metres and Halil Akkas won bronze in Men's 3000 metres.\n\nThe traditional Turkish national sport has been the oil wrestling (\"Yağlı güreş\") since Ottoman times. Edirne hosts the annual Kırkpınar oiled wrestling tournament since 1361. International wrestling styles governed by FILA such as Freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling are also popular, with many European, World and Olympic championship titles won by Turkish wrestlers both individually and as a national team. Another major sport in which the Turks have been internationally successful is weightlifting.\n\nTurkey has risen to prominence in a number of sporting areas in recent decades. Football has seen a rapid transformation earning it third place in the coveted 2002 FIFA World Cup. Its domestic teams are dominated by Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, and Galatasaray. Of these, Fenerbahçe's European triumph came in the now defunct Balkans Cup in 1968. Galatasaray has seen the most success, winning the 2000 UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup. In recent years, Turkey has exported many of its players into top foreign teams, including Internazionale, FC Barcelona, Parma, Milan, and Bayern Munich, among others. As well as sending players abroad, the Turkish league has also attracted players into Turkey. The current president of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was a professional footballer in his youth. World class players such as Pierre van Hooijdonk, Mário Jardel, Nicolas Anelka, John Carew, Milan Baroš, Radomir Antić, Óscar Córdoba, Lincoln, Mateja Kežman, Kleberson, Roberto Carlos, Zoran Simović, Frank de Boer, Giovani dos Santos, Franck Ribéry, Harry Kewell, Dani Güiza, Guti, Quaresma, Gheorghe Hagi, Jô, Abdul Kader Keita, Shabani Nonda, Lucas Neill, Lorik Cana, Giga Popescu, Jérôme Rothen and many more have played at some point or continue to play in Turkey.\n\nBasketball is also gaining popularity in Turkey.

Turkey's greatest success in international basketball came when it hosted the 2010 FIBA World Cup, finishing second to the USA. Türkoğlu captained the national side and made the all-tournament team. Turkey also advanced to the quarter-finals in the 2006 FIBA World Cup, achieving a non-expected sixth place. Turkey reached the quarter-finals again eight years later at the 2014 FIBA World Cup. The Turkey women's national basketball team won the silver medal at the EuroBasket Women in 2011. Galatasaray won the 2008-09 FIBA EuroCup, finished third in the same competition in 2007-08, and also was runner-up in the 2009 FIBA Europe SuperCup Women. Fenerbahçe won the prestigious EuroLeague as the first and only Turkish club ever in the 2016–17 season.\n\nVolleyball, especially women's volleyball is a popular sport in Turkey. Recently Turkey women's national volleyball team secured 6th place at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship in 2010 in Japan, and won a bronze medal at the Women's European Volleyball Championship in 2011 in Serbia. Turkey's top women's volleyball team is Vakıfbank, which have won the silver medal at the FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship in 2011 in Doha, the gold medal at the CEV Women's Champions League in the 2010-11 season and the gold medal in both Challenge Cup and Women's Top Volley International in the 2007-08 season.

You must apply to have one by submitting some I.D. cards and paying a fee 150 Turkish Lira for two years. Details concerning fishing zones, the minimum sizes of fish that can be caught, and the numbers of fish that can be caught per person can be obtained from the Department of Fisheries at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Aegean and Mediterranean seas are rich fishing areas.\n\nPlane gliding, hang gliding, parachuting, paragliding and single engine flights are catered for as well as services that provide instruction courses. Best areas are Fethiye, Eskişehir, Pamukkale, and Istanbul.\n\nMotorsports have become popular recently, especially following the inclusion of the Rally of Turkey to the FIA World Rally Championship calendar in 2003, and the inclusion of the Turkish Grand Prix to the Formula One racing calendar in 2005. Other important annual motorsports events which are held at the Istanbul Park racing circuit include the MotoGP Grand Prix of Turkey, the FIA World Touring Car Championship, the GP2 Series and the Le Mans Series. From time to time, Istanbul and Antalya also host the Turkish leg of the F1 Powerboat Racing championship; while the Turkish leg of the Red Bull Air Race World Series, an air racing competition, takes place above the Golden Horn in Istanbul. Surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, paragliding and other extreme sports are becoming more popular every year.\n\nThe track located at Istanbul has a seating capacity of 155,000 people (biggest in Europe), is just over 5,340 m long and runs anti-clockwise. The track was designed by Hermann Tilke, designer of the Sepang, Bahrain and Shanghai tracks.\nGP2 series also include a Turkish Team (Petrol Ofisi FMS International) and a Turkish Driver, Jason Tahincioglu.\n\nKenan Sofuoğlu became world champion in Supersport three times in 2007, 2010, and 2012.\n\nTurkey's rivers provide perfect conditions for canoeing and rafting, for both beginners and experienced. Some of the best rivers for rafting are Çoruh, Barhal, Berta, Fırtına, Çolaklı, Köprüçay, Manavgat, Dragon, Göksu (Silifke), Zamanti, Göksu (Feke), Kızılırmak, and Dalaman Çayı.\n\nRugby League is a relatively new sport in Turkey, so far five clubs make up the rugby league in Turkey, observer status within the Rugby League European Federation is expected within a few months.\n\nTurkey has four bordering seas; the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean Sea, so it not surprising that cruising is a popular sport. There are many cruising charters available. Gulets are traditional motor yachts and gulet holidays are becoming increasingly popular. Best Gulets are build in Marmaris and Bodrum.\n\nWeightlifting has been another successful sport for Turkey, regularly relied upon to provide gold medals in the Olympics. Its most famous weightlifters, Naim Süleymanoğlu and Halil Mutlu, are only two of four weightlifters in the world to have won three gold medals in three Olympics, and among women Nurcan Taylan broke one world record.\n\nThe bays around Çesme, Alaçatı, Bodrum, and Datça peninsulas as well as Antalya have ideal wind conditions for windsurfing. Famous windsurfer Çağla Kubat is also from Turkey.\n\n\n"}

The town lies on the Kilifi Creek and sits on the estuary of the Goshi River. Kilifi is capital of the Kilifi County and has a population of 122,899 (2009 census ).\n\nKilifi is known for its beach and for the ruins of Mnarani, including mosques and tombs, dating from the 14th to the 17th century.\n\nKilifi town sits on both sides of the estuary and are linked by the Kilifi Bridge which overlooks the estuary. The south side has the Mnarani ruins and Shauri Moyo beach while the north side is the main part of Kilifi Town and Bofa Beach.\n\nThe weather is generally warm throughout the year (above 25°C) with two seasons of moderate rainfall (about 800-1000 mm). Long periods of rain start around March and last into July, while the short periods start around October and last until December.\n\nThe terrain is generally flat with sandy-loamy soils. Common trees include \"Cocos nucifera\", \"Anacadium occidentale\", \"Azadirachta indica\", and \"Mangifera indica\".\n\nKilifi is a cosmopolitan town with mixed ethnic groups. The predominant inhabitants (about 80%) are from the Mijikenda groups (mainly Giriama and Chonyi). Other groups include the Swahili-Arab descendants, Barawas, Bajunis, Somalis as well as other groups from inland. There is a handful of Indians, and Europeans, mainly British, German and Italian.\n\nLike every coastal town, fishing in Kilifi is one of the historical economic activities. With time, the town has slowly been transforming from a fishing village to basic industrial and service.\n\nThe growth of the town was mainly fuelled by the cashew nut milling factory between 1976 and 1990; the district has been a producer of cashews since 1930. The town almost became a ghost town when the factory was closed due to decline in nuts supply, mismanagement of the factory and increased global competition. Other industrial activities include milk processing at Kilifi Plantations.\n\nSince 2008 with the transformation of the Kilifi institute of Agriculture into Pwani University There has been substantial expansion of the service sector as a result of this. Banking activity has been growing with about 7 banks (KCB, Barclays, Postbank, Imperial, Equity, Co operative, Diamond Trust Bank and most recent National Bank) as well as microfinance institutions. Retail business and hotels have historically been significant economic activities. 3 to 4 star hotels include Mnarani Club, Kilifi Bay Beach Resort and Baobab Lodge.\n\nThe Kilifi County Hospital, which is also a referral hospital, serves all of Kilifi County, and also supports the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, a large medical research center collaborative between Kenya's KEMRI and the British Wellcome Trust, known for its work on malaria and bacterial and viral childhood infections. Several other private clinics can be found here. The Khairat Medical Centre which was recently opened is equipped with modern laboratory, x-ray and scan machines with qualified personnel is situated in the Mtaani area of Sokoni Sb-Location opposite Masjid Hudaa.\n\nKilifi is home to several notable organizations, including: \n\n"}
{"id": "1943494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943494", "title": "Adventure Galley", "text": "Adventure Galley\n\nAdventure Galley, also known as Adventure, was an English sailing ship captained by William Kidd, the notorious privateer. She was a type of hybrid ship that combined square rigged sails with oars to give her manoeuvrability in both windy and calm conditions. The vessel was launched at the end of 1695 and was acquired by Kidd the following year to serve in his privateering venture. Between April 1696 and April 1698, she travelled thousands of miles across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in search of pirates but failed to find any until nearly the end of her travels. Instead, Kidd himself turned pirate in desperation at not having obtained any prizes. \"Adventure Galley\" succeeded in capturing two vessels off India and brought them back to Madagascar, but by the spring of 1698 the ship's hull had become so rotten and leaky that she was no longer seaworthy. She was stripped of anything movable and sunk off the north-eastern coast of Madagascar. Her remains have not yet been located.\n\nThe vessel was acquired for Kidd by a consortium of investors who backed a scheme to hunt down pirates, recover their booty and redistribute it among the investors. He had enlisted the support of Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont and governor-general of the British Province of New York and the ambitious Robert Livingston the Younger, who later became the mayor of Albany, New York. With Coote's backing, Kidd obtained a commission from King William III to operate as a privateer. The other investors who came aboard the scheme after it met with the king's approval were the Earl of Oxford, the Earl of Romney, the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Lord Chancellor, Sir Edmund Harrison and John Somers. The king himself was not an investor but was nonetheless entitled to one tenth of the proceeds.\n\nThe vessel was purchased for £8,000 (£ today) in August 1696. She had been launched on 4 December 1695 from Captain William Castle's dockyard in Deptford on the outskirts of London. Her design combined sails and oars, an unusual combination for warships at that time, that incorporated three ship-rigged masts and two banks of oars. This allowed her to make under full sail and under oar. Although rowing was slow it enabled the ship to manoeuvre against the wind, or in calm conditions where other vessels that relied on sails alone could not make any progress. A number of British warships had been built to similar designs following the lessons learned from the wars against the Barbary pirates of North Africa, whose galleys had proved formidable opponents, and trading companies such as the East India Company (EIC) also built oared frigates. Castle's yard, where \"Adventure Galley\" was built, was one of the largest private shipyards in England and was a supplier of vessels to the EIC.\n\n\"Adventure Galley\" was well-armed with a complement of 32 guns (saker or light cannon). It is not clear whether she was in fact a new vessel or had originally been intended for the navy; she may have been a commercial vessel under refit at Castle's yard before she was acquired by Kidd's consortium. She does not appear to have been particularly well-built, to judge from the problems that Kidd faced with her seaworthiness during her short career in his service. It was not uncommon for shipyards to cut corners and use sub-standard materials, and to pocket the difference in costs as extra profit. Although no picture has survived of \"Adventure Galley\", HMS \"Charles Galley\", which was recorded in contemporary paintings, provides a good example of how the English adapted the oared frigate design for warfare.\n\nAfter leaving Deptford on 6 April 1696, Kidd brought \"Adventure Galley\" along the coast to Plymouth in south-western England. He set sail from there on 23 April, bound for New York, and reached the city around 4 July. The ship was accompanied by a French fishing vessel that Kidd captured during the Atlantic crossing. He had the French boat condemned in New York as prize, and recruited more crewmen and set sail again on 6 September, heading for the Indian Ocean. \"Adventure Galley\" called at Madeira (reached on 8 October) and Boa Vista, Cape Verde (on 19 October) to pick up supplies \"en route\". The long voyage down the western coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope took the rest of the year and it was not until 27 January 1697 that \"Adventure Galley\" made landfall at Tuléar (now Toliara), Madagascar.\n\nBy this time \"Adventure Galley\" was in need of fresh sail and rigging. The fact that the ship's existing supplies had barely lasted eight months suggests that the dockyard may have installed substandard equipment. After staying a month in Tuléar, \"Adventure Galley\" sailed on to Johanna (now Anjouan) in the Comoros on 18 March, where East India Company ships often refitted. However, Kidd was unable to obtain credit from local merchants to buy new rigging or sails, and chose instead to take \"Adventure Galley\" to another island – either Mayotte or Mohéli – for careening, to clean her hull of encrusted barnacles and weeds. This was accomplished successfully over the course of a month but up to a third of her crew died in an outbreak of an epidemic disease, possibly malaria or yellow fever. Kidd sailed back to Johanna to find replacement crewmen and this time was able to raise the credit for new sails and rigging.\n\nAccording to Kidd's testimony, he \"steered for India\" on 25 April 1697. By now he was a year out of London and had no prize money to show for his efforts. He had failed to find any pirates and turned his own hand to piracy. \"Adventure Galley\" did not go immediately to India but travelled to the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the mouth of the Red Sea, where she is said to have unsuccessfully tried to attack a Mughal convoy. In September 1697, \"Adventure Galley\" arrived on the Malabar Coast of India, where Kidd finally managed to capture two ships travelling under French passes – a pair of merchantmen, \"Rouparelle\" and \"Quedah Merchant\". Unfortunately for Kidd, the latter ship was captained by an Englishman and when news of her capture reached London he was publicly condemned as a pirate.\n\n\"Adventure Galley\" next and final stage of her voyage took her to the Île Sainte-Marie, a pirate haven off the north-east coast of Madagascar. By now, according to Kidd's narrative, \"his gally was very leaky\", probably because of a rotten hull. The ship arrived there about 1 April, accompanied by the \"Rouparelle\" (renamed \"November\") and \"Quedah Merchant\" (renamed \"Adventure Prize\"). On arrival, most of the crew promptly deserted to another pirate captain, Robert Culliford and sank \"November\". Kidd was left with only thirteen men to crew \"Adventure Prize\" and the now-unseaworthy \"Adventure Galley\". According to one of her crew, William Jenkins, after the rest of the crew had deserted Kidd \"run \"Adventure Galley\" on shoar in Madagascar. They stript her furnishings and set her on fire to get her iron worke.\" This is contradicted by Kidd's own account, which stated that his skeleton crew \"could not keep the galley from sinking, and went on board of the prize [i.e. \"Quedah Merchant\"].\"\n\nNo more is currently known about the ship's fate and last position. The Discovery Channel commissioned Barry Clifford, a well-known underwater explorer, to find \"Adventure Galley\" as part of its \"Quest\" series in 1999–2000. He identified what were believed to be the wrecks of \"Adventure Galley\" and \"Rouparelle/November\", as well as Culliford's \"Mocha Frigate\", William Condon's \"Flying Dragon\" and Captain Chivers' \"New Soldado\". Excavations recovered timbers made from English oak and a few scanty artifacts which were identified by Clifford as coming from \"Adventure Galley\". In 2015, Clifford recovered a metal bar from the site, which was marked with the letters S and T and was claimed to be made of silver. The accuracy of Clifford's conclusions about the wrecks remain debated in the scientific community. A UNESCO expert team subsequently rejected Clifford's conclusions, declaring the apparent shipwreck site to be only a broken part of the port constructions and identifying the metal bar as being 95% lead and probably a piece of ballast.\n\n"}

Having survived the Holocaust along with his brother Emil, Frankenthal returned to his home in Germany where he experienced the common disbelief and denial of Nazi war crimes.\n\nFrankenthal eventually put his biography to paper in the 1990s in his book \"Verweigerte Rückkehr\" which was published half a year before his death. The English edition was published in 2002 under the title \"The Unwelcome One: Returning Home from Auschwitz\".\n\nFrankenthal was born into a family of prominent Jewish butchers in Schmallenberg, Province of Westphalia. In the Frankenthal home the Jewish religion was strictly followed mainly due to the Orthodox Jewish traditions of Frankenthal's mother, Adele Frankenthal. In the village of Schmallenberg there was a strong Christian, mainly Roman Catholic, presence.\n\nAfter Jewish businesses began to be boycotted following the Nazi Party's seizure of power in 1933, the Frankenthal family was no longer able to properly provide themselves with basic necessities. Due to attempts to get around the new laws through extensive contacts in the German community, the Frankenthal family received several visits from the SA to investigate their ongoing commercial activities. The contacts themselves were also running a great risk in that the names of so-called \"Traitors to the People and State\" were published in the Nazi newspaper \"Rote Erde\" (\"Red Earth\"). To avoid being seen, the farmers preferred to trade at night; however, after the curfew for Jews was enacted, this was no longer possible.\n\nFrankenthal's father, Max Frankenthal, believed that the Nazis would not harass his family to a large extent because he was a decorated soldier in the First World War. Max Frankenthal was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for his service during the war, having reached the rank of sergeant, and was a member of the veterans' union after the war. He took part in the erection of the first war memorial for the fallen soldiers from Schmallenberg.\n\nIn 1937 Max Frankenthal was arrested after allegations from German farmers in Friedeburg that he had attempted to manipulate the weighing scale in order to haggle the price of stock down. He was only held for several hours because the owner of the scales spoke out in his defence. This was, however, only the first of several groundless arrests that were used to intimidate the Jewish community of Schmallenberg. The charges ranged from claims of theft to \"Rassenschande\" (crimes against race).\n\nOn 10 November 1938, the local synagogue was burnt down and most of the Jews were arrested. All over the village Jewish homes were raided and vandalised. The Nazis dubbed the country-wide event \"\"Kristallnacht\"\". The women and children were released the same day, but the men remained in custody in a shelter for the homeless. The families of those still in custody were able to bring food to their loved ones until the inmates were transferred to the Gestapo jail in nearby Dortmund. The Jews remaining in Schmallenberg were then forced to sign over the title deeds of their property with the promise that it would bring their husbands and sons back. During the \"Kristallnacht\", only one German in Schmallenberg is known to have protested. Dina Falke stood on the street and asked the SA troopers what the Jews had ever done to them until she was silenced by worried family members. Several citizens actively aided the SA in destroying Jewish property and raiding Jewish Homes. Robert Krämer allegedly helped the SA by providing straw to set the synagogue in flames.\n\nOn 28 November, the Jewish men were allowed to return home. They had been transferred from the jail in Dortmund to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin. Max Frankenthal had to sign his agreement of the selling of his land to the Arisierung program. This program involved the confiscation of Jewish-owned property for the fictitious Aryan master race. In addition to the confiscation of their property, the Jewish men had to prove that they would leave the country within several weeks, or face the penalty of returning to the concentration camps, this time with their families. Max Frankenthal tried to begin plans for the family's emigration, but eventually was unable to come up with money, and was still convinced that the Nazis would not continue their harassment of his family.\n\nAt this point the Nazis began to make life for the Jews even harder. They implemented \"Arbeiteinsätze\", in which the Jews were forced to work on projects such as digging ditches to hold water for fighting fires in the upcoming war. Max Frankenthal worked in a factory owned by a friend where he avoided exploitation until the factory was no longer able to hold forced labourers. He and his brother, Emil Frankenthal, were then sent to work for the city, where Emil died of a stroke. The German government ceased to recognise the citizenship of Jews and forced them to add the name \"Sara\" to all female names and \"Israel\" to all male names.\n\nAs the school in Schmallenberg was now closed to Jewish children, Frankenthal and his brother began attending classes at a workshop in Dortmund where they learnt hand skills, foreign languages and were educated in Zionism. In May 1941 this workshop was closed by the Dortmund Gestapo and the students were forced to work for the state. Frankenthal and his brother began work for a roadworks company named Lahrmann. He later learnt that his father also worked in the same work party.\n\nOn 28 February 1943, the construction site manager informed the workers that they would be required to report to the former Jewish school in Dortmund for the checking of their work papers. Upon their arrival they were placed under arrest and then held for several days before being loaded into cattle transport wagons and sent east.\n\nFrankenthal, and several others of those arrested, received an order from one of the officers who was in charge of the troopers to pack the Jews' luggage into several wagons. At a train station in Bielefeld, Frankenthal noticed that these wagons were no longer attached to the train. Because his father had already been detained in a concentration camp, Frankenthal asked what was going on. His father informed him that they would not require their luggage at their destination.\n\nDuring the journey the inmates’ food and water rations were simply cancelled, and several of the older ones did not survive. After spending three days and three nights in the train, the arrested Jews arrived in the Auschwitz concentration camp complex.\n\nAs the family arrived at the camp, Max Frankenthal told his two sons that he was sure that he would not survive the ordeal, and that should they get out, to go back to Schmallenberg. The Jews were then ordered to exit the train. In the confusion the two sons lost their parents, who they later learned were sent directly to the gas chambers. When asked by the SS, Frankenthal claimed to be 18, so that he would be put to work. He was then ordered to enter a group where he found his three uncles and a cousin. Those selected for work were loaded onto trucks and transported to labor camps. Frankenthal was sent to Auschwitz III Monowitz.\n\nAs they arrived, the inmates were forced to strip naked and were sent to their barracks where their bodies were shaved. They then had their inmate numbers tattooed onto their arms. Frankenthal became 104920 and his brother 104921. The inmates were then sorted out according to skills. The brothers both claimed to be locksmiths, although they had only begun training at the workshop in Dortmund. They were then showered and issued with their striped uniforms.\n\nThe \"Blockältester\", or inmate block leader, then greeted the new arrivals to inform them of their current situation: they were in an extermination camp, and any family members, whom they could not see in this block, had probably already been gassed.\n\nThe inmates in Frankenthal's block were composed mainly of Jews, with several political prisoners as well. The prisoners were forced to work under horrendous conditions for long hours. The inmates also worked alongside civilian workers from the Polish and German populations who instructed the inmates inside the camp, but not inside the electric fence.\n\nMost of the prisoners in Monowitz worked for IG Farben in Liquidation. During his internment at the camp, Frankenthal played a minor role in the largely unsuccessful resistance. He was also subject to dental experiments from SS doctors.\n\nOn 18 January 1945, the death march began for the prisoners of Auschwitz. On the second day of the march the group reached Gleiwitz (Gliwice), where they were loaded onto open cattle wagons and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Upon arrival the SS soldiers accompanying the Auschwitz inmates discovered that Buchenwald was full, and could no longer take on any inmates. From Buchenwald they were then sent to Mittelbau-Dora, a new site for the V2 production since bombing raids on the Peenemünde facility threatened to end the project.\n\nHere the inmates built V2 rockets in an underground factory. When the inmates began the deliberate sabotage of German rockets, prisoners were hanged from the ceiling as a warning to the other workers. During an aerial bombardment of the camp on 3 April 1945, Frankenthal, his brother, and another inmate managed to escape. In the confusion the brothers were separated from the third fugitive. After three days they were recaptured by a group of \"Volkssturm\" (German militia). They were put on transports and sent east. At some point Frankenthal lost consciousness and awoke two days after they were liberated by Russian troops.\n\nThe train stopped at Theresienstadt concentration camp, where they were ordered into a new set of barracks shortly before the Soviet Red Army arrived and liberated the inmates. Despite the now available food, water and basic medical care, many of the freed prisoners died in the days after due to the lasting effects of malnutrition and maltreatment and a typhoid fever epidemic. Shortly after the liberation, Frankenthal found his aunt in Theresienstadt, who had survived a Ghetto because of her status as \"Halbjüdin\" (Half-Jew). He and his brother then organised their return to Schmallenberg through the Displaced Persons Program.\n\nUpon their return to Schmallenberg, the brothers found out that although several houses were destroyed during the war, their parents' house was not among them. The house was, however, inhabited by some relatives who had already made their way from a ghetto back to Schmallenberg.\n\nFrom 2011 onwards the Foundation Auschwitz Committee (Stiftung Auschwitz-Komitee) inaugurates the Hans Frankenthal Prize. This annual prize is awarded to groups, initiatives and institutions that accomplish educational work and awareness training according to the aims of the Auschwitz Committee for the remembrance of the Shoah and against neo-fascist activities.\n\n"}

Tables are linked using primary key to foreign key relationships. It is possible for users to update one table in a relationship in such a way that the relationship is no longer consistent and this is known as breaking referential integrity. An example of breaking referential integrity: if a table of employees includes a department number for 'Housewares' which is a foreign key to a table of departments and a user deletes that department from the department table then Housewares employees records would refer to a non-existent department number. \n\nPropagation constraints are methods used by relational database management systems (RDBMS) to solve this problem by ensuring that relationships between tables are preserved without error. In his database textbook, Beynon-Davies explains the three ways that RDBMS handle deletions of target and related tuples:\n\n\n"}

Particularly, it is identified as the lower subsection of the visible segment and represents images, which Plato described as \"first shadows, then reflections in water and in all compacted, smooth, and shiny materials\". According to the philosopher, \"eikasia\" and \"pistis\" add up to \"doxa\", which is concerned with genesis (becoming).\n\n\"Eikasia\" has several interpretations. For instance, it is the inability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else. It therefore prevents us from perceiving that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. Another variation posited by scholars such Yancey Dominick, explains that it is a way of understanding the originals that generate the objects that are considered as \"eikasia\". This allows one to distinguish the image from reality such as the way one can avoid mistaking a reflection of a tree in a puddle for a tree. \n\nIt is part of Plato's Analogy of the Divided Line.\n"}

In 1907 he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to study violin. From 1908 to 1911 he was a law student. In 1920 Eller graduated from the conservatory renamed to Petrograd Conservatory. His younger brother was sculptor Aleksander Eller.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1940, Eller was a professor of music theory and composition at the Tartu Higher School for Music. During this time he formed the Tartu school of composition, which gave rise to many composers, including Eduard Tubin. In 1940 he became a professor of composition at the Tallinn Conservatory and taught there until his death in 1970. He was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1967.\n\nEller was a teacher of composition. The school he formed in Tartu counterbalanced the so-called Tallinn school headed by Artur Kapp. Eller's pedagogical talent is versatile. The list of his pupils offers the best proof of this: each of them has created a distinguished original style.

He is noted for his books, \"Thespis: Ritual, Myth, and Drama in the Ancient Near East\" (1950), \"The Dead Sea Scriptures\", about the Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as his one-volume abridgement of Sir James Frazer's massive 13-volume work \"The Golden Bough\", to which Gaster contributed updates, corrections and extensive annotations.\nGaster was born in London, the son of the folklorist Moses Gaster, then Chief Rabbi of the English Sephardi community, who was Romanian by birth and a well-known linguist and scholar of Judaica. He was also a leading Zionist, and named his son after his friend, Theodor Herzl, who had died in 1904, shortly before the boy's birth. Theodor recalled that the first draft of the Balfour Declaration of 1917 was prepared in his father's home. His mother was the daughter of Michael Friedländer. Visitors to the Gaster home included Churchill, Lenin, and Freud.\n\nEducated at the University of London, Gaster received an undergraduate degree in classics in 1928 and a master's degree in Near Eastern archaeology in 1936. His master's thesis, a preview of his key work, was titled \"The Ras Shamra Texts and the Origins of Drama.\"\n\nIn 1939 or 1940 Gaster moved from London to New York and began work on a PhD at Columbia University. While pursuing his doctorate, he continued to publish.\n\nIn 1942 he began teaching part-time in the graduate school at Columbia, and in 1945 he also began teaching part-time at Dropsie College in Philadelphia. From 1946 to 1950 he was a lecturer on Semitic civilization at New York University. From the mid-1940s until the mid-1960s, he was a visiting professor at many colleges and universities in the United States and three times at the University of Leeds.\n\nGaster's first full-time American post came in 1945, when he served for a year and a half as chief of the Hebraic Section of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In 1951 and 1952, he was a Fulbright Fellow in the history of religions at the University of Rome, and in 1961 he was a Fulbright Fellow in Biblical studies and history of religions at the University of Melbourne.\n\nMost of the books for which Gaster is best known were published in the 1950s, including his translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls, widely admired for its felicitousness; \"Thespis\", his application of the Frazerian myth-and-ritual theory to the ancient Near East and beyond; and his abridgment and updating of Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\" (\"The New Golden Bough\" [1959]), in which he retained the theory but updated the data. This abridgment was of Frazer's twelve-volume third edition of his opus, which Frazer himself had abridged into one volume in 1922. Gaster's final major work, the two-volume tome \"Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament\" (1969), was similarly an abridgement and updating of Frazer's \"Folk-lore in the Old Testament\". In 1955, he released an album on Folkways Records, \"The Hebrew Language: Commentary and Readings by Theodor H. Gaster\".\n\nOnly in 1966, at the age of sixty, did Gaster secure a permanent full-time academic post, as professor of religion at Barnard College, the women's undergraduate division of Columbia University. He helped revamp the curriculum and was Head of the Department of Religion from 1968-1972. He continued to lecture widely, and from 1971 to 1981 he was professor of religion and director of ancient Near Eastern studies at Dropsie College, by then renamed Dropsie University.\n\nUpon his retirement from Barnard, he was once again a visiting professor at many American universities. He relocated to Florida to teach for several years at the University of Florida. He moved to Philadelphia in 1988 and died there on February 2, 1992, survived by his wife, Lotta, and daughter, Corinna.\n\nElaine Pagels, who taught for a time at Barnard College, notes in her book \"Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas\" (2003), that Gaster, her Barnard colleague, was \"the 13th son of the Chief Rabbi of London. He knew all the languages of the Bible, and, at one time in 1976, students in one of his classes heard that he knew 32 languages in all.

Fuller\n\nReginald Cuthbert Fuller (12 September 1908 – 21 April 2011) was ordained as a priest in 1931 by Cardinal Bourne, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, and appointed Canon (hon.) of Westminster Cathedral by Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor in 2001. He celebrated his 100th birthday in 2008.\n\nBorn in London, he contributed significantly to the advancement of Roman Catholic life and ecumenism in England during the 20th century, notably through co-founding the Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain, his collaboration as an Editorial Committee member of the first one-volume Bible commentary for English-speaking Catholics and his General Editorship of its second edition, and his work as a member of the Revised Standard Version Bible Committee and as Co-Editor of the first complete Bible translation in modern English for Catholics from the Hebrew and the Greek, as well as of its ecumenical edition. His specialist subjects were the Deuterocanonical Books, on which he contributed articles to three major Biblical Commentaries (see \"Publications\" below), and the life and works of Alexander Geddes, a pioneer of biblical criticism, on which he wrote his doctoral thesis (see \"Publications\" below).\n\nInitially Fuller's parents, the physician and medical author Arthur William Fuller and Florence Margaret Fuller (née Montgomery), of St John's Wood, London, sent their son to Ealing Priory School (subsequently renamed St Benedict's School) where he happened to share classes and hone his Latin skills in competition with a younger pupil, later also a New Testament scholar who would be Fuller's colleague on a number of major academic projects, John Bernard Orchard. Recognizing his academic potential, they then decided to move their son to Cardinal Vaughan School, before sending him for the final years of his schooling to Ampleforth College.\n\nFuller attended seminary studies at Allen Hall, St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire, from 1926 to 1931 and was ordained priest by Cardinal Bourne at Westminster Cathedral in 1931. His academic studies at the Dominican University in Rome earned him a SThL in 1933 and a SThD in 1935, and at the Biblical Institute in Rome a SScriptLic in 1934. During 1964–1968 he took up biblical research at Cambridge University and earned a PhD.\n\nAt various times during 1950–1994 Rev. Fuller held pastoral appointments in the Archdiocese of Westminster. He served as Rector of the Church and Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption and St. Gregory, Warwick Street, London W1 (1950–1963), as Chaplain at Westminster Cathedral (1976–1978), and as Rector of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, Islington (1978–1983). After his retirement he served as Assistant Priest at the Church of St. Mellitus, Tollington Park, London (1983–1990, (where on one occasion in the sacristy he was attacked by intruders and hit over the head with a crucifix but suffered no lasting injury), and at the Church of Our Lady and St. Joseph, Poplar, London (1990–1994). Thereafter he took up residence in Clergy House at Westminster Cathedral, regularly hearing Confessions at the Cathedral and helping with occasional exhibitions. In 2003 he moved to Nazareth House, where on request he continued to provide spiritual guidance to his visitors on an individual basis.\n\nFuller was lecturer in Biblical Studies at Allen Hall, St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire, from 1936 to 1949, for the Newman Association from 1950 to 1954, and at St Mary's College, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, from 1968 to 1972. He then spent three years in Kenya as lecturer in Old Testament Studies at the University of Nairobi from 1972 to 1975. While there he availed himself of the opportunity to indulge some of his recreational interests and with members of the university staff went mountain climbing and visited Mount Kenya and the Ngorongoro Crater, and admired the wild-life in Serengeti/Tanzania and the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1990 Fuller was a member of the \"Society of Old Testament Studies (SOTS)\". Among his involvement in major professional projects was the co-founding of the \"Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain\" (CBA), of which he then was Hon. Secretary from 1940 to 1965 and chairman from 1968 to 1982. As representative of the CBA he acted in 1963 as Promoter of the English spelling of Biblical names for Catholic use to the Conference of the Bishops of England and Wales (e.g. Noah, Elijah, Joshua, in place of Noe, Elias, Josue as in the Douay-Challoner Bible, based on the Latin text).\n\nFr Bernard Orchard invited Fuller onto the Editorial Committee of the first one-volume Bible commentary for English-speaking Catholics, entitled \"A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (CCHS, 1953 ); and the Diocese entrusted Fuller in 1951 with the office of \"Censor Deputatus\" for the \"Nihil Obstat\" in its regard (cf. CCHS, p. iv). When subsequent developments – among them Vatican II and the discovery of the manuscripts in the caves at Qumran – required an updating of the commentary, he was General Editor of its second edition, entitled \"A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (1969).\n\nHe was, moreover, Co-Editor of the first complete Bible translation in modern English for Catholics from the Hebrew and Greek, entitled \"The Holy Bible – Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition\" (1966), and its ecumenical counterpart, \"The Common Bible\" (1973). He was a member of the Revised Standard Version Bible Committee from 1969 to 1980 and of the Joint Committee on the Revised English Bible from 1979 to 1989. From 1946 to 1953 he was the Editor of the quarterly journal, \"Scripture\".\n\nIn addition to many articles and book reviews that Fuller contributed to specialist journals, e.g. \"Scripture Bulletin\", \"Priests and People\", \"The Tablet.\" He wrote articles on the Deuterocanonical Books for \"A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (1953), \"A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (1966), and \"International Catholic Bible Commentary\" (1996), and the articles \"\"\"Alexander Geddes\",\" 1737–1802\" and \"Mythology and Biblical Studies to 1800\" for \"Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation\" (1999).\n\nHis PhD thesis was published in 1984 under the title \"Alexander Geddes: A Pioneer of Biblical Criticism, 1737–1802\".\n\nHe outlined the history of the Church and Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, better known as \"Warwick Street Church\", where he had been a Rector from 1950 to 1963, in a small illustrated book entitled \"Steadfast in Loyalty – Warwick Street Church – A Short History and Guide\" (1956, 1973).\n\nHis friendship with Leonard Cheshire led to his editing a slender volume providing an insight into Cheshire's spiritual resources during his struggle with the effects of motor neurone disease, entitled \"Crossing the Finishing Line – Last Thoughts of Leonard Cheshire VC\" (1998, , see pp. 7–14, 80).\n\n"}

She is best known for her 1934 book \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry: Psychological Studies of Imagination\" (London: Oxford University Press). It is generally taken to be a major work in applying the theories of Carl Jung to literature.\n\nBodkin's other main works are \"The Quest for Salvation in an Ancient and a Modern Play\" (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1941) and \"Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy\" (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1951). She lectured at Homerton College, Cambridge from 1902 to 1914.\n\nIn \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\", Bodkin applies Jung's theory of the collective unconscious to poetry, discovering a deep-seated primitive meaning behind recurring poetic images, symbols, and situations. She tried, as Boswell (1936: 553) quotes, \"to bring psychological analysis and reflection to bear upon the imaginative experience communicated by great poetry, and to examine those forms or patterns in which the universal forces of our nature there find objectification.\"\n\nAmong the forms or archetypal patterns Bodkin presented, according to Boswell, may be included: the “Oedipus complex,\" the \"rebirth archetype,\" the \"archetype of Heaven and Hell,\" and \"images of the Devil, the Hero, and God\" (Boswell 1936: 553). Boswell goes on to write that Bodkin's \"analyses and presentation are excellent; but the explanations, where any are attempted, seem inadequate to account for some very significant facts which the analyses have brought out\" (Boswell 1936: 553).\n\nOn the other hand, Willcock (1936: 92) states that \"the final impression left by Bodkin's book is one of unusual sensitiveness in reading and sincerity in recording experience.\" In addition, \"Bodkin's pursuit of primordial symbols serves her determination to show, at least from one angle of approach, what poetry is and how it works. She holds herself back from slipping down the easy slope of paraphrase and prose meanings; neither does she drift into allegories and typifiyings\" (Willcock 1936: 91).\n\nFinally, Hooke (1935: 176) called \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\", \"a distinguished book; distinguished by acute reasoning, wide and deep learning, and a fine sensitiveness to poetic values. It is a courageous and, to a great extent, successful attempt to apply the technique of analytical psychology to the cloudy and elusive emotional patterns brought up into consciousness by the magic of great poetry.”\n\nThe texts Bodkin discusses in \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\" include those of Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, and Coleridge (Hooke 1935: 176; Boswell 1936: 553; Willcock 1936: 91); Goethe and Euripides (Boswell 1936: 553); and Aeschylus, Shelley, T.

Eliot, as well as the Christian Gospels (Hooke 1935: 177).\n\nAt work in the poems of Milton and Aeschylus, for example, as well as in Shelley's \"Prometheus Unbound\", is a fatherlike figure that Bodkin identifies as the Divine Despot (Bodkin 1934: 250; cited in Allgaier 1973: 1036).\n\nThe Divine Despot seems to be involved in the Heaven-and-Hell archetype, the kernel of which contains a \"vital aspect\" that is both positive and negative, and appears in space \"as an image of loveliness with an ever attendant threatening shadow, a desolation beneath or around it\" (Bodkin 1934: 122; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 721).\n\nHeaven, Hell, and the Divine Despot may descend to earth and have offspring in the Hamlet theme which involves a child's \"ambivalent attitude\" toward its parents and off of which are spun such variants as Oedipus and Orestes (Bodkin 1934: 11–15, cited in Williams 1973: 221), or all may remain at the divine level, as in the situation with Milton's God and Satan, or Aeschylus's Zeus and Prometheus:\n\n\"The antagonism between Prometheus and Zeus can partly be traced to a very general psychological tension, between the instinct of self-expression and rebellion against group values, and the opposite instinct to sustain those group values, and to merge personal claims in a greater power. Bodkin shows how Milton's Satan represents both these psychological forces at different times. Sometimes he is the heroic antagonist of tyranny, and sometimes a devilish enemy of group values, conceived to reside in the protection of God. In the mind of the reader there are these forces, sometimes inherited from very ancient times, and they may determine his response to the poetry quite independently of his conscious thinking about God, fate, and morality. As in the mind of poet or percipient the character of Satan alternates, so inversely the character of God must alternate too. In the Prometheus of Aeschylus are remembered dim fears that progress is wrong, inimical to the group; but also there are present instincts of self-assertion and rebellion. These instincts are connected with the infantile wishes and fears which still lurk in our minds. A poet may 'recall an infantile type of religious fear,' suggesting 'the Freudian doctrine of the father complex or \"imago\", in relation to God.' 'The Freudian school of psychologists has asserted that the religious life represents a dramatisation on the cosmic plane of emotions which arose in the child's relation to his parents' \" (Knight 1938: 53–54; citing Bodkin 1934: 191, 232 ff., 239, 242).\n\nComplicating matters is the Rebirth archetype which, like the Heaven-and-Hell archetype, also involves a \"vital aspect\" that is simultaneously positive and negative, but which appears, not static, but rather \"as a passage in time, from life to desolate death and beyond, to life renewed\" (Bodkin 1934: 122; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 721). In addition, there is a \"night-journey stage within the pattern of Rebirth\" (Bodkin 1934: 136; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 735).\n\nRebirth is\n\n\"a movement, downward, or inward toward the earth's centre, or a cessation of movement—a physical change which … appears also as a transition toward severed relation with the outer world, and, it may be, toward disintegration and death. This element in the pattern is balanced by a movement upward and outward—an expansion or outburst of activity, a transition toward redintegration and life-renewal\" (Bodkin 1934: 54; cited in Morgan 1971: 42).\n\nRebirth starts with frustration and has as its goal transcendence; between these two extends the \"process of growth, or 'creative evolution,' in the course of which the constituent factors are transformed\" (Bodkin 1934: 72; cited in Morgan 1971: 42).\n\nHeaven, Hell, and Rebirth are related: \"Heaven is mainly a garden in spring, Hell the scape of winter or a desert, and Rebirth an April violet\" (Shmiefsky 1967: 721). Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" is an example of this interrelation of the two archetypes, where Bodkin claims that \"it is as though the poet's feeling divined the relation of the concepts of Heaven and Hell to the images of spring's beauty and of the darkness under the earth whence beauty comes forth and to which it returns\" (Bodkin 1963: 97; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 735). Further interpatterning of the two archetypes, spatially and temporally, occurs when Satan emerges \"upwards from his tremendous cavern below the realm of Chaos, to waylay the flower-like Eve in her walled Paradise and make her an inmate of his Hell, even as Pluto rose from beneath the earth to carry off Proserpine from her flowery meadow\" (Bodkin 1934: 97–98; cited in Rosenman 1978: 12)\n\nAbove everything, the Star image \"shines clear, for a moment between the opposites, between man and woman, between day and night; [it] fades and returns like the bloom of a flower, as the world's rhythms sweep on\" (Bodkin 1934: 296; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 725).\n\nBodkin did not limit herself to the classics nor to Jung, however. She was also an astute reader of other important philosophers of the time. The July 1938 issue of \"Philosophy\", for example, published a letter Bodkin wrote to the editor concerning Santayana:\n\nWhile the same journal's issue of July 1940 presented this statement by her:\n\n“In my own thought I have realized the importance of Professor Collingwood's principle. The process he describes of being 'burdened' with a problem that begins as a 'formless disturbance' and takes shape gradually in urgent questions, is a matter of the emotional no less than of the intellectual life. Those of us who genuinely hold liberal or democratic principles hold them, I would maintain, neither as habit nor as merely 'cerebral,' unemotional thought. Rather they are involved in our intellectual and emotional struggle with problems so deeply rooted within our individual and social life as to be virtually religious in character\" (Bodkin 1940: 335).\n\nBodkin also grappled with the ideas of I. A. Richards and A. N. Whitehead, examining the latter's concept of the \"Divine persuasion\" in a 1945 article entitled \"Physical Agencies and the Divine Persuasion\" and the former's understanding of \"truth in poetry\" in an article of the same name, which concludes:\n\n“As I clarify, through reflective analysis of imaginative communication, my intellectual references to those social objects—states and forces entering our common life—which the poet may portray through heroic figures, or name God, Devil, Heaven, Hell, I am at the same time ordering my emotional attitudes toward those objects. The gain which has come to those of us whom Dr. Richards's writings have stimulated to keener interest in the attitudes harmonized by poetry is enhanced, it seems to me, when we restore to those attitudes and references which Richards separates the unity claimed for them by the Philosophy of Organism\" (Bodkin 1935: 472).\n\nChristian themes, along with those from \"the great religions of the East\" (cited in Hayward 1952), came to dominate Bodkin's later thought and writings, which may also have been influenced by her readings of Martin Buber, Gilbert Ryle, and Karl Jaspers (among others), as her 1944 letter to the editor of \"Philosophy\", \"Our Knowledge of One Another,\" and a 1956 article in the same journal, \"Knowledge and Faith,\" seem to show. The title of Bodkin's short (54 pages) book, \"The Quest for Salvation in an Ancient and a Modern Play\", substantiates one of her chief concerns. This book compares Aeschylus's Eumenides with themes in T. S. Eliot's \"The Family Reunion\", the \"modern play\" which Bodkin had reviewed two years earlier, in May 1939.\n\nAs for Bodkin's last major work, \"Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy\", Carré (1952: 285) states that it \"comprises loose meditations on religious themes, straying through a range of cloudy ideas and culling bunches of quotations from novelists, playwrights, poets and prophets.\" The \"basic question\" that \"Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy\" explores was \"suggested to the author by Martin Buber,\" while \"the answer, insofar as any answer can be given, is derived from certain philosophical implications of Carl Jung's psychological studies\" (Hayward 1952: 225). In this book, Bodkin tried \"to understand and make some reasonable discrimination and choice among the type-images which are actually working among us and openly available to us in literary, ritualistic, or philosophical forms\" (Hayward 1952: 225).\n\nHayward also states that Bodkin criticised \"Freud's critique of religion on the grounds that he knew only Zeus or Jehovah, the paternal-authoritarian type of God, a God who never underwent birth, suffering, death, as did Dionysos or Jesus\" (Hayward 1952: 226). In addition, Aldrich (1953: 153) points out that \"Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy\" is \"a sequel and supplement\" to \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\" and that the theme of both books is \"the current widespread idea that we have not wholly awakened out of the 'dream' of mythic consciousness, whose symbols are still exploited in great poetry and religion and even metaphysics.\"\n\nFurthermore, \"both books were written under the spell mainly of C. J. Jung, but also of Albert Schweitzer and Plato. Both use introspective, subjectivist methods of depth psychology, attempting to disclose or make explicit the 'archetypal patterns' of prelogical experience and culture\" (Aldrich 1953: 153).\n\nSome writers felt that the \"type-image\" of Bodkin's last book was a more fruitful concept than the \"archetype\" of her first. For example, Walter Sutton published an essay in 1960 which\n\n\"discusses C. G. Jung's concept of 'archetype' as it was used by various critics especially by Maud Bodkin. The conclusion of the discussion is to the effect that instead of 'archetype' we should rather use the concept of 'type-image' as Maud Bodkin did lately. We avoid thereby the dubious mythological and psychological connotations of the term: archetype—since the term ‘type-image’ admits the possibility of a historical succession of types without implying the existence of a unique prototype supposed to be the underlying substratum of all literary forms referring to a primordial ‘myth.’ The proposed new term retains the idea of uniformity and recurrence inherent in the idea of ‘archetype’ but makes us conceive literature as a culturally conditioned phenomenon valued not because of mythical uniformity but because of appreciation of historically varying originality” (Rieser 1962: 109).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Among his students were Brian Ferneyhough, Younghi Pagh-Paan, Toshio Hosokawa, Wolfgang Rihm, and Kaija Saariaho. He received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 2009, among other awards.\n\nBorn in Bern, Huber first studied violin and music pedagogy from 1947 to 1949 at the Zurich Conservatory with Stefi Geyer. From 1949 to 1955, he was a violin teacher at the Zurich Conservatory. At the same time he studied composition with Willy Burkhard. He continued his composition studies with Boris Blacher in Berlin.\n\nAs a composer, Huber began with serial music influenced by Anton Webern. His international breakthrough came in 1959 with the world premiere of his chamber cantata \"Des Engels Anredung an die Seele\" at the Weltmusiktage (World Music Days) of the Internationale Gesellschaft für Neue Musik in Rome. Unusually for the time, he used consonant intervals within a strictly serial context.\n\nHe became one of the leading figures of his generation in Europe, compared to Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. He composed extensively for chamber ensembles, choirs, soloists and orchestra. His works for the theatre look for scenes beyond opera and oratorio. Huber was a socially and politically conscious composer and his music often conveys a humanistic message. He set texts by biblical prophets and medieval mystics such as Hildegard of Bingen. He was also inspired by texts of Augustine, Andreas Gryphius, Ernst Bloch, Heinrich Böll, and of Latin American liberation theologians. From the 1980s, Huber studied Arabic music and poetry and included their influences in his works.\n\nHuber taught music history at the Lucerne Conservatory from 1960 to 1963, and composition at the City of Basel Music Academy (1961–72) and at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg (1973–90). He was also appointed director of the composition seminars at the Gaudeamus Foundation in Bilthoven, Netherlands, in 1966, 1968, and 1972. Additionally, he held international visiting professorships and composition classes in (among others) Paris, London, Geneva, Milan, Lyon, Montreal, Sarajevo, and Tatui (Brazil). Several of his students became internationally recognized composers, including Brian Ferneyhough, Younghi Pagh-Paan (later his wife), Toshio Hosokawa, Wolfgang Rihm, and Kaija Saariaho. He was a member of the Akademie der Künste in Berlin from 1986.

This allows one part of the egg to be used without the other part, or each part to be treated in different ways. Recipes for custard call for egg yolks, for example. \n\nThe most common reason for separating eggs is so the whites can be whipped. Also, because cholesterol is only found in the yolk, using only egg whites in a recipe will drastically reduce its cholesterol content.\n\nAll methods for separating eggs make use of the fact that the yolk can hold itself together while the white is more runny. Since the yolks of older eggs are more watery, which makes separation difficult, it is best to begin with the freshest eggs available.\n\nAlthough many recipes require eggs to be at room temperature, it is easiest to separate eggs that are cold. Eggs that are at room temperature can be separated, but this requires greater caution to avoid breaking the yolk. One solution is to separate the eggs, cover them, and then allow them to come to room temperature. In this method eggs should not be allowed to sit too long because of the risk of bacteria growth. An alternate solution is to bring the bowl of egg whites (or yolks) up to temperature by placing it in another bowl of hot water.\n\nDifferent methods:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1943597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943597", "title": "City of Birmingham Stadium", "text": "City of Birmingham Stadium\n\nThe City of Birmingham Stadium was a proposed multi-purpose stadium in the Saltley area of Birmingham, England, originally for Warwickshire County Cricket Club and Birmingham City F.C. to replace the current Edgbaston Cricket Ground and St Andrews Stadium respectively.\n\nThe cricket club cancelled these plans however, and only the football club remained interested. The original proposal was the centrepiece of a larger scheme to create a £300 million sports village on a site.\n\nThe proposal was for a 55,000-seat arena was to be part-funded by Las Vegas Sands, but the hopes of securing a licence for a super casino on site were rejected and Birmingham City F.C. were then unable to proceed with the plans for the stadium.\n\nThe proposed stadium and sports village was to be located on a site currently occupied by Birmingham Wheels in the 'Wheels Adventure Park' of the Saltley area of Birmingham. The site is bounded by several active railway lines, a canal and numerous major roads.\n\nIn relation to other areas, the site is near the St Andrews neighbourhood of Bordesley Green which is home to the St Andrews Stadium. The stadium is to the southwest of the development. Small Heath is to the south whilst Nechells is located to the west and Aston to the north. It is 1.1 miles (1.77 kilometres) from Birmingham New Street station in the city centre.\n\nPhase 1 covers the Wheels Adventure Park and would have included the stadium within it. In terms of area, it was almost equal to that of Phase 2. Phase 1 would require the least amount of demolition as the land is largely untouched by development. The northern boundary of Phase 1 was determined by the Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line which serves the area via the nearby Adderley Park railway station. The western boundary was determined by another railway line and partially by a canal whilst the eastern boundary is determined by a road. Phase 2, to the south, is the separated from Phase 1 via the boundary of land owned by Birmingham Wheels. Within the phase would be a soccer dome, indoor arena, basketball courts, health and fitness centre, Olympic-sized swimming pool and an entertainment complex, which would be attached to the stadium.\n\nPhase 2 was the most southerly phase of the development and is a predominantly industrial site. Occupied by many workshops and warehouses, it required some of the most demolition needed for the project. This part of the sports village would have been home to community football pitches, tennis courts, residences, a hotel and large retail space. The southern and eastern boundaries are determined via roads and the small western boundary, via a railway line.\n\nPhase 3 was the smallest phase in terms of area and would have been used for the construction of residential properties and park land. The site is occupied by warehouses and workshops. It is separated through the centre via a road creating two thin strips of land which are bounded to the east by a canal.\n\nThe entire site is contaminated as a result of heavy industry in the past and many of the buildings are derelict. It is believed the cost of decontaminating the land would be at £1 million an acre.\n\nThe new stadium would have been a multi-purpose 55,000-seater stadium which can host cricket, football, rugby and concerts. It was proposed to include moving tiers of seating. It was planned for a supercasino to be built on site, however, after the council backed a separate bid at the National Exhibition Centre in Solihull which consisted of an 85,000 seater stadium to replace the former Wembley Stadium. Amongst other sites campaigning for the National Stadium were Coventry. However, London remained the preferred location for the Wembley replacement. The bid for the sports village was pulled out by the council and it appeared dead.\n\nThe initial designs showed a stadium with an elliptical footprint and a sloping roof. This stadium was proposed to be built on green belt land known as the Meriden Gap, and not on the later chosen Wheels' Adventure Park. When the plans developed into more serious proposals, images of the new proposed stadium showed a stadium with a rectangular footprint and a large external framework. It was the only part of the sports village to have had a detailed design as the other buildings had not had full consideration.\n\nThe sports village would have included numerous facilities for sports as well as Birmingham's first Olympic size swimming pool, however there were plans for an Olympic size swimming pool to be built at a site in Aston University near the Eastside. As well as this, of the development could have formed a new community sports campus, on top of a 200-bed hotel, an outdoor theatre, approximately 2,500 new residential properties, a 170,000 square foot (15,793 m²) entertainment complex and large retail space. An estimated total of 6,000 jobs will be created.\n\nPlans for a new stadium were aired as early as 2001 and it gained support from many football managers. Sven-Göran Eriksson gave his support and the then-current chairman of Aston Villa Football Club, Doug Ellis, announced that 47 of England's 92 league club chairmen had written to him backing the stadium. However, Ellis' support was subject to the venue becoming England's new national stadium. It was eventually overlooked for this honour in favour of a re-built Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nIt was revealed in late 2004 where the sports village would be located, however, not what the proposal would look like. Immediately, David Gold, chairman of Birmingham City F.C., submitted his support for the stadium. In March 2005, Birmingham City Council had a meeting to seek authority for the City Council to enter into an exclusivity agreement. Those at the meeting decided to implement the plan. In May 2005, an image of the stadium was released however the full plans were not. The council again held a meeting to answer and questions and to ease any concerns people had over the proposed stadium. There was confusion over whether this plans were for a new Birmingham City Football Club stadium or for a stadium for the city in general. Plans for two separate stadiums were even considered; one at the NEC and another on the Birmingham Wheels site. The ambitious plans, designed by Populous, were unveiled in October 2005 after talks between the council and Las Vegas Sands.\n\nIn November 2005, a campaign for support for the stadium and super casino on site was launched. An opinion poll revealed that over 80% were in favour and supportive of the project in the area. This came two months after local councillors said they would object the plan on moral and religious grounds.\n\nHowever, on 20 March 2006 it was announced that the move would be unlikely to happen after Birmingham City Council announced plans to back the bid for a rival casino at the National Exhibition Centre, and not the one at the City of Birmingham Stadium. This was partly as a result of a petition handed to the council with 6,000 signatures from people in Saltley and Washwood Heath. This backfired and claims from local councillors in 2005 that 84% of residents were supportive of the proposals. However, it was revealed that the majority of the city were supportive of the proposals. Rumours of the Birmingham City board trying once again to get the backing of the council have been spreading in the press, however nothing has been confirmed at this time.\n\nFor twelve months, there was little news of the plans except for Birmingham City Football Club saying there were still in talks with the council over the prospect of the Sports Village and stadium.\n\nOne year later, after a period of little news, it was revealed that the late regeneration councillor at Birmingham City Council, Councillor Ken Hardeman (Conservative councillor for Brandwood), was to campaign to investors at the MIPIM show at Cannes, France as part of Team Birmingham in March 2007.\n\nFollowing the MIPIM show, Ken Hardeman announced that the plans for the stadium were alive and that investors were interested in the stadium. However, there was no mention of the plans for a sports village raising uncertainty over whether they were no longer being assessed. Hardeman also revealed that the council were prepared to give of land they already own around the Birmingham Wheels site towards the project, creating an site.\n\nThe 55,000-seater stadium would have become the seventh largest football stadium in terms of capacity in England, behind Wembley Stadium, Old Trafford, London Stadium, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Emirates Stadium. It would have been the largest football stadium in the city.\n\nThe sports village proposed for the city which will surround the stadium is similar to the Olympic Village proposed for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, however on a smaller scale.\n\nThe supercasino which was proposed for the site along with the stadium was to become the first in the country. There had been mixed views over the submission of the bid for permission to build the casino on the site and it faced competition from other locations such as Blackpool, Manchester and The O2 in London with Manchester being the city selected to construct the supercasino.\n\nThe stadium would have been one of the most expensive developments in the city at an estimated £300 million. This is rivalled by the Bullring Shopping Centre, Snowhill, Gateway Plus, Arena Central and Martineau Galleries.\n\n"}
{"id": "1943628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943628", "title": "Hoon", "text": "Hoon\n\nA hoon, in Australia and New Zealand, is a person who deliberately drives a vehicle in a reckless or dangerous manner, generally in order to provoke a reaction from onlookers.\n\nHoon activities (or hooning) can include speeding, burnouts, doughnuts, or screeching tyres. Those commonly identified as being involved in hooning are young and predominantly male drivers in the age range of 17 to 25 years.\n\nHoon control laws are beginning to be extended to dangerous hoon behaviour using boats and other vessels, particularly jet skis. The State of Victoria, Australia passed legislation in late 2009 to control hoon activities using recreational vessels.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century in Australia, the term \"hoon\" (and its rhyming slang version \"silver spoon\") had a different meaning: one who lived off immoral earnings (i.e. the proceeds of prostitution, a pimp or procurer of prostitutes).\n\nLinguist Sid Baker in his book \"The Australian Language\" suggested that \"hoon\" (meaning \"a fool\") was a contraction of Houyhnhnm, a fictional race of intelligent horses which appears in \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift.\n\nHoon, when used in relation to people in motor vehicles (or associated with car culture), may be onomatopoeia. One may speak of a car, or its driver, or its occupants in general as \"hooning down the road\".\n\nThe term \"hoon\" has obtained a semi-official use in Australia, with police and Governments referring to legislation targeting anti-social driving activity as \"anti-hoon laws\". The term has even begun to appear in the titles of legislation, for example the Transport Legislation Amendment (Hoon Boating and Other Amendments) Act 2009 of the State of Victoria.\n\nIn Western Australia, the \"Road Traffic Amendment (Impounding and Confiscation of Vehicles) Bill 2004\", which was passed by the Parliament of Western Australia in June 2004, empowered the Western Australia Police to confiscate and impound vehicles found to be engaging in excessive speed or noise. The law was used to impound a Lamborghini after a mechanic was caught speeding in it; he had been driving without the owner's knowledge. The police claim that the law does not permit them to release the car under the only legal course of action available to the owner, that of \"hardship\". The police retorted that, having the means to own it, \"he can afford to hire a vehicle.\" The owner complained that the law amounted to \"mandatory sentencing without trial\". The Western Australian Police Minister, Rob Johnston, \"admits the laws are unfair but says he stands by them\". Former Western Australia District Court Chief Judge Antoinette Kennedy described the minister's reaction as \"the politics of envy\". After all hoon-related offences, the defendant's licence is cancelled and experience accumulated on it is returned to zero.\n\nIn the state of Victoria, hoon-related offences include burnouts, doughnuts, drag racing, repeated driving while disqualified and high-level speeding were added to Section 84C of the \"Road Safety Act 1986\" in July 2006. Victoria Police have impounded an average of ten cars a day under the laws, with over 5,000 vehicles confiscated and impounded two years after their introduction. By contrast, the hoon boating laws of Victoria currently centre on offences involving dangerous behaviour and do not yet reference offences relating to public order or amenity.\n\nIn Queensland, the \"Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000\" allows members of the Queensland Police to impound the vehicles involved in prescribed offences. The laws relating to confiscation of vehicles for offences such as street racing, time trials and burnouts were strengthened in 2002. Further laws introduced in July 2008 provided for the confiscation of vehicles for repeat offenders involved with drunk driving, driving while suspended or driving with illegal modifications.\n\nThe maximum penalty for hooning in Queensland is $4,712 or 6 months imprisonment. Repeat offenders can lose their vehicle for 48 hours for the first repeat offence, up to three months for a second repeat offence, or permanently for a third repeat offence. On 11 August 2008, a number of confiscated vehicles were auctioned by the government; the remainder were crushed and sold as scrap metal.\n\nIn New South Wales, the word \"hoon\" is actually contained in the name of the legislation – the \"Road Transport Legislation Amendment (Car Hoons) Act 2008\" enacted in July 2008 – which introduced new measures against street racing and increased fines. Previous legislation provided only for the vehicles of repeat offenders to be forfeited to the Crown, but the Car Hoons Act allowed for them to be used in crash testing by the Roads and Traffic Authority, for educational and deterrence purposes, and roadworthiness testing in the context of modifications.\n\nIn South Australia, the relevant legislation is the \"Criminal Law (Clamping, Impounding And Forfeiture Of Vehicles) Act 2007\". The legislation, amended in December 2009, directs that, upon conviction for a 'prescribed offence' the motor vehicle be forfeited to the Crown; the Police Commissioner then has discretion to sell or otherwise dispose of it, i.e. crush it. At the end of 2010, 62 cars had been impounded by the courts. None were worth more than $1600 and many were not capable of reaching 150 km/h.\n\nThe laws are still being updated in Tasmania.\n\nIn the 2010s there has been a rise in hoon gatherings with hoon gangs or hoon crime syndicates in relation to criminal activity uploading their images and videos on social media. The names of these hoon gangs or crime syndicates include the \"Black Bandit\" in Victoria and the \"Mexican Hoon Cartel\" in Queensland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1943634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943634", "title": "City Ground", "text": "City Ground\n\nThe City Ground is a football stadium in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Trent. It has been home to Nottingham Forest Football Club since 1898, and has 30,445 seats.\n\nThe stadium was a venue when England hosted Euro 96, and is only away from Meadow Lane, home of Forest's neighbouring club Notts County; the two grounds are the closest professional football stadiums in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. They are located on opposite sides of the River Trent.\n\nNottingham Forest moved to their new ground on 3 September 1898 – 33 years after their formation and six years after election to the Football League.\n\nTo raise the £3,000 required to finance the move the club asked members, supporters and businessmen to subscribe to \"New Ground Scheme\" bearer bonds which cost £5 each. Over £2,000 was raised this way.\n\nThe new ground was called the City Ground. It was only a few hundred yards from the old Town Ground at the opposite end of Trent Bridge, which had been named after the Town Arms pub. Nottingham was granted its Charter as a City in 1897 and it was called the City Ground to commemorate this as the land on which it stands was at that time within the City boundary. In 1952 boundary changes resulted in the ground coming under the local council of West Bridgford (Rushcliffe Borough Council) rather than the City. Opposite the City Ground, still within the City boundaries, lies Meadow Lane, home of Notts County. The City Ground was wide open on three sides with no protection from the weather but the pitch was one of the finest in the country. This was due to the presence on the committee of J. W. Bardill, a nurseryman whose family firm still exists in Stapleford near Nottingham and whose company was given the task of preparing the pitch.\n\nIn 1935, the club had the opportunity to buy the ground from Nottingham Corporation for £7,000 but they declined.\n\nOn 12 October 1957, a new East Stand opened at the City Ground, costing £40,000 and having benches to seat up to 2,500 fans. The visitors for the opening were Manchester United’s \"Busby Babes\", just four months before eight of them died in the Munich air disaster. On 11 September 1961, the floodlights at the ground were officially turned on for the first time as Forest faced Gillingham in the League Cup. A new record attendance of 49,946 was set in October 1967 when Forest beat Manchester Utd 3-1 in a First Division fixture, five months after Forest had finished second to United in the league. \nIn December 1967 the City Ground was host to an England U23 match against Italy.\n\nThe Main Stand was largely rebuilt in 1965 but, on 24 August 1968, fire broke out during a First Division game against Leeds United. It started in the boiler room, just before half-time. The stand was damaged but, despite a crowd numbering 31,126, none of them were injured. The only reported injuries were to a television crew on the TV gantry, who had to scramble down it because the access ladder was stored in the boiler room. The gantry was extended the length of the stand and now has access at both ends. As a result of the fire, Forest played six 'home' matches at nearby Meadow Lane and did not win one of them. Sadly many of the club's records, trophies and other memorabilia were lost in the fire. The stand was refurbished. \n\nThe Executive Stand was built in 1980 at a cost of £2 million — largely from proceeds of the highly successful era in which Forest brought the European Cup back to Nottingham in 1979 and 1980, having won the league title in 1978. Forest also won the Football League Cup twice during that era.\n\nUnder Clough's reign, Forest had taken the English domestic game and the European scene by storm and money raised from those successes was invested in a stand that had a capacity of 10,000. It was renamed The Brian Clough Stand after his retirement, and was re-opened after refurbishment by the man himself in the mid-1990s. The stand also incorporated 36 executive boxes and a large dining area, which was designed to be the focus of the club's corporate hospitality arrangements.\n\nNottingham Forest had been the opposing team in the fateful FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool at Hillsborough, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989, in which 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a human crush on the stadium's terraces. The disaster resulted in the Taylor Report ordering that all clubs in the top two divisions of English football should have an all-seater stadium by August 1994. This resulted in the need for more redevelopment and refurbishment at the City Ground.\n\nMore major development took part in 1992–93 with the rebuilding of the Bridgford Stand. Work started in April 1992 and when completed the Stand had a capacity of 7,710, the lower tier of 5,131 being allocated to away supporters. The unusual shape of the roof was a planning requirement to allow sunlight to reach houses in nearby Colwick Road. The Stand includes accommodation for 70 wheelchair supporters. It also houses a management suite, which includes the public address systems, computerised electronic scoreboard controls and the police matchday operation.\n\nThe Trent End was the most recent stand to be rebuilt between 1994 and 1996 — in time for Euro 96, the European Football Championships. The new stand, such a prominent landmark by the River Trent, held 7,338 to take the ground's capacity to 30,576 all-seated.\n\nThe ground would be able to expand to up to 46,000 if ever there was ever a return to the top flight. Forest were relegated from the FA Premier League three times between 1993 and 1999. Although they achieved promotion at the first attempt following the first two relegations, they have yet to return to the Premier League since their relegation in 1999 and even spent three seasons in League One - English football's third tier.\n\nOn 20 June 2007, the Forest board announced plans for a possible relocation to a new 50,000-seat stadium in the city, although such a move was not expected to take place before 2014. This was part of England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup, but in December 2010 England's World Cup bid was rejected in favour of Russia being selected as the host nation.\n\nSeveral improvements to the stadium have been made since the Trent End rebuild such as two new LED Screens being installed between the Trent End and the Brian Clough Stand and in the far corner of the Bridgford Stand. A small number of seats were lost because of this. LED advertising boards were also installed around the perimeter of the pitch excluding the Main Stand. These improvements cost around £1 million.\n\nThe City Ground also hosted the FA Women's Cup Final for two successive years in 2007 and 2008. The 2007 final was contested by Arsenal L.F.C. and Charlton Athletic L.F.C. with the attendance of 24,529 smashing the previous record attendance for the competition of 13,824 for the final between Arsenal L.F.C. and Fulham L.F.C. at Selhurst Park in 2001. In 2008, the attendance record was broken once again when 24,582 spectators saw Arsenal L.F.C. beat Leeds United 4–1.\n\nAside from football, the stadium has also hosted two other large-scale events. On 28 April 2002 the stadium hosted a semi-final of rugby's Heineken Cup in which Leicester Tigers beat Llanelli Scarlets 13–12. Leicester Tigers once again played at City Ground when they were defeated 19-16 by Racing 92 on 24 April 2016 in the semi-final of the European Rugby Champions Cup. The stadium hosted its first music concert when R.E.M. performed there in front of an audience of 20,000.\n\nIn October 2015, Forest renamed the Main Stand, \"The Peter Taylor Stand\" after former European Cup winning assistant-manager Peter Taylor, who died 25 years earlier.\n\nFollowing issues with the ground's safety certificate, the capacity of the stadium was reduced to 24,357 ahead of the 2016–17 season.\n\nIn June 2007, Nottingham Forest announced plans to leave the City Ground after more than 100 years, with the aim of Nottingham having a ground suitable to hold matches for the 2018 World Cup, for which England was a bidding nation. The City Ground was deemed unsuitable, even with expansion, due to the areas that needed to be available for fan parks around the stadium; the City Ground is in a dense urban area, surrounded by private housing, businesses and industry. The initial plan was to move to a new 50,000-seater purpose built stadium in Clifton towards the south of the city, forming part of a new housing and leisure development. However, this location was soon changed to a site at Gamston due to logistical problems surrounding plans for a Clifton ground, such as potential matchday pressures on the proposed Nottingham Express Transit tram extension and the A453.\n\nPlans for the Gamston ground were exhibited to the FA World Cup committee in 2009, and Nottingham's plans for a new ground and waterside Fan Park using the River Trent, meant they were successful in getting through to the next stage of potential host cities for the 2018 World Cup bid, even beating plans by neighbours Derby and Leicester, who already had new stadiums but were eliminated from the Host City pool. However, objection from Gamston residents and its out-of-town location has meant that afterwards, this Stadium site changed again, with the City Council looking towards an area of wasteland currently being redeveloped, known as Eastside, around a mile to the East of the city centre near the Sneinton area. \n\nAround 2002, there were plans to rebuild the City Ground's Main Stand (on the condition that Forest return to the Premier League) – a plan which would make the ground up to around 40,000 capacity. However, Forest now justified the new ground plan over the previously proposed City Ground Main Stand extension by suggesting that the current 'new' stands (Trent End, Brian Clough Stand, Bridgford Stand) were in a state which, 10 years down the line, would be money intensive on club funds, along with other complex FIFA host ground restrictions. Much of the funding for the brand new stadium however would be from the private sector or Nottingham City Council.\n\nPossible stadium names were suggested by some supporters, including the Brian Clough Arena, the New City Ground, City of Nottingham Stadium, and the Robin Hood Arena.\n\nDue to the 2018 FIFA World Cup being awarded to Russia, plans for a new ground were shelved. By 2019, the club had decided to remain at the City Ground and rebuild the Main Stand.\n\nOn 28 February 2019 the club confirmed an extended lease on the City Ground, allowing it to proceed with plans to redevelop the stadium and surrounding area. Central to this will be the replacement of the current Peter Taylor Stand with a new 10,000-seater stand, and improvements to the Trentside area, Brian Clough and Bridgford Stands.\n\nThe new Peter Taylor Stand will see the introduction of a museum, new club shop, executive boxes, and a range of hospitality lounge options and restaurants.\n\nThe club is hopeful that building work will commence at the end of the 2019–20 season. The new, modern, state-of-the-art structure will see the City Ground's capacity become the highest in the East Midlands, reaching 38,000 after completion.\n\nThe following games were played at the City Ground during the opening phase of the UEFA Euro 96 tournament.\n\n"}
{"id": "1943640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943640", "title": "Intersectionality", "text": "Intersectionality\n\nIntersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding how aspects of one's social and political identities (gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, height etc.) might combine to create unique modes of discrimination. It aims to broaden the agenda of the first waves of feminism, which largely focused on the experiences of white, middle-class women. The broad agenda means that intersectionality is used to find combinations of injustices that are felt by members of society. For example, a black woman might face discrimination from a company that is not distinctly due to her race (because the company does not discriminate against black men) nor her gender (because the company does not discriminate against white women), but by a unique combination of the two. Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from white feminism by acknowledging the fact that all women have different experiences and identities. It is a qualitative analytic framework that identifies how interlocking systems of power affect those who are most marginalized in society. The term was coined by black feminist scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989. There are various forms of social stratification such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, ability, and gender, which are included in the consideration of intersectional feminism and its social and cultural effects. The purpose of intersectionality as a theory is to identify how overlapping categories of identity impact individuals and institutions, and take these relationships into account when working to promote social and political equity. It ensures that feminism considers not only gender, but also combinations of various types of oppression that result in people's experiences of injustice. While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society, today the analysis has expanded to include many more aspects of social identity. Race and gender bias are two separate issues; however, they can be combined to create even more harm. Intersectionality is used to describe this phenomenon of being impacted and oppressed by multiple sources, but only treated for one. Intersectionality may also be related to the term triple oppression, which engages with similar themes. \n\nIntersectionality has been critiqued as being inherently ambiguous. The ambiguity of this theory means that it can be perceived as unorganized and lacking a clear set of defining goals; this arguably means that intersectionality will be unlikely to achieve equality due to its unfocused agenda. Without a clear focus, it is difficult for a movement to create change because having such a broad theory makes it harder for people to fully understand its goals. As it is based in standpoint theory, critics say the focus on subjective experiences can lead to contradictions and the inability to identify common causes of oppression.\n\nThe concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked by feminist theory and movements. As articulated by author bell hooks, the emergence of intersectionality \"challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate\". The historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement in the United States resulted in many black 19th and 20th century feminists, such as Anna Julia Cooper, challenging their historical exclusion. This disputed the ideas of earlier feminist movements, which were primarily led by white middle-class women, suggesting that women were a homogeneous category who shared the same life experiences. However, once established that the forms of oppression experienced by white middle-class women were different from those experienced by black, poor, or disabled women, feminists began seeking ways to understand how gender, race, and class combine to \"determine the female destiny\". \n\nRacial inequality was a factor that was largely ignored by first-wave feminism, which was primarily concerned with gaining political equality between men and women. Early women's rights movements often exclusively pertained to the membership, concerns, and struggles of white women. Second-wave feminism stemmed from Betty Friedan’s \"The Feminine Mystique\" and worked to dismantle sexism relating to the perceived domestic purpose of women. While feminists during this time achieved success through the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title IX, and \"Roe v. Wade\", they largely alienated black women from platforms in the mainstream movement. However, third-wave feminism—which emerged shortly after the term \"intersectionality\" was coined in the late 1980s—noted the lack of attention to race, class, sexual orientation, and gender identity in early feminist movements, and tried to provide a channel to address political and social disparities. Intersectionality recognizes these issues which were ignored by early social justice movements. Many recent academics, such as Leslie McCall, have argued that the introduction of the intersectionality theory was vital to sociology and that before the development of the theory, there was little research that specifically addressed the experiences of people who are subjected to multiple forms of oppression within society. An example of this idea was championed by Iris Marion Young, arguing that differences must be acknowledged in order to find unifying social justice issues that create coalitions that aid in changing society for the better. More specifically, this relates to the ideals of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW).\n\nThe term also has historical and theoretical links to the concept of \"simultaneity\", which was advanced during the 1970s by members of the Combahee River Collective in Boston, Massachusetts. Simultaneity is explained as the simultaneous influences of race, class, gender, and sexuality, which informed the member's lives and their resistance to oppression. Thus, the women of the Combahee River Collective advanced an understanding of African-American experiences that challenged analyses emerging from Black and male-centered social movements, as well as those from mainstream cisgender, white, middle-class, heterosexual feminists.\n\nSince the term was coined, many feminist scholars have emerged with historical support for the intersectional theory. These women include Beverly Guy-Sheftall and her fellow contributors to \"Words of Fire: An Anthology of African-American Feminist Thought\", a collection of articles describing the multiple oppressions black women in America have experienced from the 1830s to contemporary times. Guy-Sheftall speaks about the constant premises that influence the lives of African-American women, saying, \"Black women experience a special kind of oppression and suffering in this country which is racist, sexist, and classist because of their dual race and gender identity and their limited access to economic resources.\" Other writers and theorists were using intersectional analysis in their work before the term was coined. For example, Deborah K. King published the article \"Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology\" in 1988, just before Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality. In the article King addresses what soon became the foundation for intersectionality, saying, \"Black women have long recognized the special circumstances of our lives in the United States: the commonalities that we share with all women, as well as the bonds that connect us to the men of our race.\" Additionally, Gloria Wekker describes how Gloria Anzaldúa's work as a Chicana feminist theorist exemplifies how \"existent categories for identity are strikingly not dealt with in separate or mutually exclusive terms, but are always referred to in relation to one another\". Wekker also points to the words and activism of Sojourner Truth as an example of an intersectional approach to social justice. In her speech, \"Ain’t I a Woman?\", Truth identifies the difference between the oppression of white and black women. She says that white women are often treated as emotional and delicate while black women are subjected to racist abuse. However, this was largely dismissed by white feminists who worried that this would distract from their goal of women's suffrage and instead focused their attention on emancipation.\n\nIn 1989, Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term \"intersectionality\" in a paper as a way to help explain the oppression of African-American women. Crenshaw's term is now at the forefront of national conversations about racial justice, identity politics, and policing—and over the years has helped shape legal discussions. She used the term in her crucial 1989 paper for the University of Chicago Legal Forum, \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Anti-discrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\". In her work, Crenshaw discusses Black feminism, arguing that the experience of being a black woman cannot be understood in independent terms of either being black or a woman. Rather, it must include interactions between the two identities, which, she adds, should frequently reinforce one another.\n\nIn order to show that non-white women have a vastly different experience from white women due to their race and/or class and that their experiences are not easily voiced or amplified, Crenshaw explores two types of male violence against women: domestic violence and rape. Through her analysis of these two forms of male violence against women, Crenshaw says that the experiences of non-white women consist of a combination of both racism and sexism. She says that because non-white women are present within discourses that have been designed to address either race or sex—but not both at the same time—non-white women are marginalized within both of these systems of oppression as a result.\n\nIn her work, Crenshaw identifies three aspects of intersectionality that affect the visibility of non-white women: structural intersectionality, political intersectionality, and representational intersectionality. Structural intersectionality deals with how non-white women experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different than that of white women. Political intersectionality examines how laws and policies intended to increase equality have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against non-white women. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how pop culture portrayals of non-white women can obscure their own authentic lived experiences.\n\nThe term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the further development of Crenshaw's work in the writings of sociologist Patricia Hill Collins. Crenshaw's term, Collins says, replaced her own previous coinage \"black feminist thought\", and \"increased the general applicability of her theory from African American women to all women\". Much like Crenshaw, Collins argues that cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society, such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity. Collins describes this as \"interlocking social institutions [that] have relied on multiple forms of segregation... to produce unjust results\".\n\nCollins sought to create frameworks to think about intersectionality, rather than expanding on the theory itself. She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various social institutions in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality. The final branch formulates intersectionality as a critical praxis to determine how social justice initiatives can use intersectionality to bring about social change.\n\nThe ideas behind intersectional feminism existed long before the term was coined. Sojourner Truth's 1851 \"Ain't I a Woman?\" speech, for example, exemplifies intersectionality, in which she spoke from her racialized position as a former slave to critique essentialist notions of femininity. Similarly, in her 1892 essay, \"The Colored Woman's Office\", Anna Julia Cooper identifies black women as the most important actors in social change movements, because of their experience with multiple facets of oppression.\n\nA key writer who focused on intersectionality was Audre Lorde, who was a self-proclaimed \"Black, Lesbian, Mother, Warrior, Poet\". Even in the title she gave herself, Lorde expressed her multifaceted personhood and demonstrated her intersectional struggles with being a black, gay woman. Lorde commented in her essay \"The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house\" that she was living in \"a country where racism, sexism, and homophobia are inseparable\". Here, Lorde perfectly outlines the importance of intersectionality as she acknowledges that different prejudices are inherently linked.\n\nThough intersectionality began with the exploration of the interplay between gender and race, over time other identities and oppressions were added to the theory. For example, in 1981 Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa published the first edition of \"This Bridge Called My Back\". This anthology explored how classifications of sexual orientation and class also mix with those of race and gender to create even more distinct political categories. Many black, Latina, and Asian writers featured in the collection stress how their sexuality interacts with their race and gender to inform their perspectives. Similarly, poor women of color detail how their socio-economic status adds a layer of nuance to their identities, ignored or misunderstood by middle-class white feminists.\n\nAccording to black feminists and many white feminists, experiences of class, gender, and sexuality cannot be adequately understood unless the influence of racialization is carefully considered. This focus on racialization was highlighted many times by scholar and feminist bell hooks, specifically in her 1981 book \"Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism\". Feminists argue that an understanding of intersectionality is a vital element of gaining political and social equality and improving our democratic system. Collins's theory represents the sociological crossroads between modern and post-modern feminist thought.\n\nMarie-Claire Belleau argues for \"strategic intersectionality\" in order to foster cooperation between feminisms of different ethnicities. She refers to different \"nat-cult\" (national-cultural) groups that produce unique types of feminisms. Using Québécois nat-cult as an example, Belleau says that many nat-cult groups contain infinite sub-identities within themselves, arguing that there are endless ways in which different feminisms can cooperate by using strategic intersectionality, and that these partnerships can help bridge gaps between \"dominant and marginal\" groups. Belleau argues that, through strategic intersectionality, differences between nat-cult feminisms are neither essentialist nor universal, but should be understood as resulting from socio-cultural contexts. Furthermore, the performances of these nat-cult feminisms are also not essentialist. Instead, they are strategies.\n\nSimilarly, Intersectional theorists like Vrushali Patil argue that intersectionality ought to recognize transborder constructions of racial and cultural hierarchies. About the effect of the state on identity formation, Patil says: \"If we continue to neglect cross-border dynamics and fail to problematize the nation and its emergence via transnational processes, our analyses will remain tethered to the spatialities and temporalities of colonial modernity.\"\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of the black political economy. Collins writes: \"Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power.\" Du Bois omitted gender from his theory and considered it more of a personal identity category.\n\nCheryl Townsend Gilkes expands on this by pointing out the value of centering on the experiences of black women. Joy James takes things one step further by \"using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena\". Collins later integrated these three views by examining a black political economy through the centering of black women's experiences and the use of a theoretical framework of intersectionality.\n\nCollins uses a Marxist feminist approach and applies her intersectional principles to what she calls the \"work/family nexus and black women's poverty\". In her 2000 article \"Black Political Economy\" she describes how, in her view, the intersections of consumer racism, gender hierarchies, and disadvantages in the labor market can be centered on black women's unique experiences. Considering this from a historical perspective and examining interracial marriage laws and property inheritance laws creates what Collins terms a \"distinctive work/family nexus that in turn influences the overall patterns of black political economy\". For example, anti-miscegenation laws effectively suppressed the upward economic mobility of black women.\n\nThe intersectionality of race and gender has been shown to have a visible impact on the labor market. \"Sociological research clearly shows that accounting for education, experience, and skill does not fully explain significant differences in labor market outcomes.\" The three main domains in which we see the impact of intersectionality are wages, discrimination, and domestic labor. Those who experience privilege within the social hierarchy in terms of race, gender and socio-economic status are less likely to receive lower wages, to be subjected to stereotypes and discriminated against, or to be hired for exploitative domestic positions. Studies of the labor market and intersectionality provide a better understanding of economic inequalities and the implications of the multidimensional impact of race and gender on social status within society.\n\nCollins refers to the various intersections of social inequality as the matrix of domination. These are also known as \"vectors of oppression and privilege\". These terms refer to how differences among people (sexual orientation, class, race, age, etc.) serve as oppressive measures towards women and change the experience of living as a woman in society. Collins, Audre Lorde (in \"Sister Outsider\"), and bell hooks point towards either/or thinking as an influence on this oppression and as further intensifying these differences. Specifically, Collins refers to this as the construct of dichotomous oppositional difference. This construct is characterized by its focus on differences rather than similarities. Lisa A. Flores suggests, when individuals live in the borders, they \"find themselves with a foot in both worlds\". The result is \"the sense of being neither\" exclusively one identity nor another.\n\nBoth Collins and Dorothy Smith have been instrumental in providing a sociological definition of standpoint theory. A standpoint is an individual's unique world perspective. The theoretical basis of this approach views societal knowledge as being located within an individual's specific geographic location. In turn, knowledge becomes distinctly unique and subjective; it varies depending on the social conditions under which it was produced.\n\nThe concept of the outsider within refers to a unique standpoint encompassing the self, family, and society. This relates to the specific experiences to which people are subjected as they move from a common cultural world (i.e., family) to that of modern society. Therefore, even though a woman—especially a Black woman—may become influential in a particular field, she may feel as though she does not belong. Their personalities, behavior, and cultural being overshadow their value as an individual; thus, they become the outsider within.\n\nSpeaking from a critical standpoint, Collins points out that Brittan and Maynard say that \"domination always involves the objectification of the dominated; all forms of oppression imply the devaluation of the subjectivity of the oppressed\". She later notes that self-valuation and self-definition are two ways of resisting oppression. Practicing self-awareness helps to preserve the self-esteem of the group that is being oppressed and allows them to avoid any dehumanizing outside influences.\n\nMarginalized groups often gain a status of being an \"other\". In essence, you are \"an other\" if you are different from what Audre Lorde calls the mythical norm. \"Others\" are virtually anyone that differs from the societal schema of an average white male. Gloria Anzaldúa theorizes that the sociological term for this is \"othering\", or specifically attempting to establish a person as unacceptable based on a certain criterion that fails to be met.\n\nIntersectionality can be applied to nearly all fields from politics, education healthcare, and employment, to economics. For example, within the institution of education, Sandra Jones' research on working-class women in academia takes into consideration meritocracy within all social strata, but argues that it is complicated by race and the external forces that oppress. Additionally, people of color often experience differential treatment in the healthcare system. For example, in the period immediately after 9/11 researchers noted low birth weights and other poor birth outcomes among Muslim and Arab Americans, a result they connected to the increased racial and religious discrimination of the time. Some researchers have also argued that immigration policies can affect health outcomes through mechanisms such as stress, restrictions on access to health care, and the social determinants of health.\n\nAdditionally, applications with regard to property and wealth can be traced to the American historical narrative that is filled \"with tensions and struggles over property—in its various forms. From the removal of Native Americans (and later Japanese Americans) from the land, to military conquest of the Mexicans, to the construction of Africans as property, the ability to define, possess, and own property has been a central feature of power in America ... [and where] social benefits accrue largely to property owners.\" One could apply the intersectionality framework analysis to various areas where race, class, gender, sexuality and ability are affected by policies, procedures, practices, and laws in \"context-specific inquiries, including, for example, analyzing the multiple ways that race and gender interact with class in the labor market; interrogating the ways that states constitute regulatory regimes of identity, reproduction, and family formation\"; and examining the inequities in \"the power relations [of the intersectionality] of whiteness ... [where] the denial of power and privilege ... of whiteness, and middle-classness\", while not addressing \"the role of power it wields in social relations\".\n\nOver the last couple of decades in the European Union (EU), there has been discussion regarding the intersections of social classifications and the need to acknowledge their functions. Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was a debate on what these societal categories were, and how they played a role in the lives of many minorities. What was once a more cut and dried categorization between gender, race, and class has turned into a multidimensional intersection of \"race\" including religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK, they refer to these intersections under the notion of multiple discrimination. The EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; however, there is debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities. The EU is not the only organization that is acknowledging this concept. People around the world are taking a new approach when identifying other identities as well as their own; however, there are still places that follow the traditional process of categorization as stated in the following quote. \"The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell).\" This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.\n\nFor example, Chandra Mohanty discusses alliances between women throughout the world as intersectionality in a global context. She rejects the western feminist theory, especially when it writes about global women of color and generally associated \"third world women\". She argues that \"third world women\" are often thought of as a homogenous entity, when, in fact, their experience of oppression is informed by their geography, history, and culture. When western feminists write about women in the global South in this way, they dismiss the inherent intersecting identities that are present in the dynamic of feminism in the global South. Mohanty questions the performance of intersectionality and relationality of power structures within the US and colonialism and how to work across identities with this history of colonial power structures. This lack of homogeneity and intersecting identities can be seen through Feminism in India, which goes over how women in India practice feminism within social structures and the continuing effects of colonization that differ from that of Western and other non-Western countries.\n\nThis is elaborated on by Christine Bose, who discusses a global use of intersectionality which works to remove associations of specific inequalities with specific institutions, while showing that these systems generate intersectional effects. She uses this approach to develop a framework that can analyze gender inequalities across different nations and differentiates this from an approach (the one that Mohanty was referring to) which, one, paints national-level inequalities as the same and, two, differentiates only between the global North and South. This is manifested through the intersection of global dynamics like economics, migration, or violence, with regional dynamics, like histories of the nation or gendered inequalities in education and property education.\n\nThere is an issue globally with the way the law interacts with intersectionality, for example, the UK's legislation to protect workers rights has a distinct issue with intersectionality. Under the Equality Act 2010, the things that are listed as 'protected characteristics' are \"age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation\". \"Section 14 contains a provision to cover direct discrimination on up to two combined grounds—known as combined or dual discrimination. However, this section has never been brought into effect as the government deemed it too 'complicated and burdensome' for businesses.\" This demonstrates a systematic neglect of the issues that intersectionality presents, because the UK courts have explicitly decided not to cover intersectional discrimination in their courts.\n\nThird World feminists and transnational feminists criticize intersectionality as a concept emanating from WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) societies that unduly universalizes women's experiences. Third world feminists have worked to revise Western conceptualizations of intersectionality that assume all women experience the same type of gender and racial oppression. Shelly Grabe coined the term \"transnational intersectionality\" to represent a more comprehensive conceptualization of intersectionality. Grabe wrote, \"Transnational intersectionality places importance on the intersections among gender, ethnicity, sexuality, economic exploitation, and other social hierarchies in the context of empire building or imperialist policies characterized by historical and emergent global capitalism.\" Both Third World and transnational feminists advocate attending to \"complex and intersecting oppressions and multiple forms of resistance\".\n\nIn the field of social work, proponents of intersectionality hold that unless service providers take intersectionality into account, they will be of less use for various segments of the population, such as those reporting domestic violence or disabled victims of abuse. According to intersectional theory, the practice of domestic violence counselors in the United States urging all women to report their abusers to police is of little use to women of color due to the history of racially motivated police brutality, and those counselors should adapt their counseling for women of color.\n\nWomen with disabilities encounter more frequent domestic abuse with a greater number of abusers. Health care workers and personal care attendants perpetrate abuse in these circumstances, and women with disabilities have fewer options for escaping the abusive situation. There is a \"silence\" principle concerning the intersectionality of women and disability, which maintains an overall social denial of the prevalence of abuse among the disabled and leads to this abuse being frequently ignored when encountered. A paradox is presented by the overprotection of people with disabilities combined with the expectations of promiscuous behavior of disabled women. This leads to limited autonomy and social isolation of disabled individuals, which place women with disabilities in situations where further or more frequent abuse can occur.\n\nAccording to political theorist Rebecca Reilly-Cooper intersectionality relies heavily on standpoint theory, which has its own set of criticisms. Intersectionality posits that an oppressed person is often the best person to judge their experience of oppression; however, this can create paradoxes when people who are similarly oppressed have different interpretations of similar events. Such paradoxes make it very difficult to synthesize a common actionable cause based on subjective testimony alone. Other narratives, especially those based on multiple intersections of oppression, are more complex. Davis (2008) asserts that intersectionality is ambiguous and open-ended, and that its \"lack of clear-cut definition or even specific parameters has enabled it to be drawn upon in nearly any context of inquiry\".\n\nRekia Jibrin and Sara Salem argue that intersectional theory creates a unified idea of anti-oppression politics that requires a lot out of its adherents, often more than can reasonably be expected, creating difficulties achieving praxis. They also say that intersectional philosophy encourages a focus on the issues inside the group instead of on society at large, and that intersectionality is \"a call to complexity and to abandon oversimplification... this has the parallel effect of emphasizing 'internal differences' over hegemonic structures\".\n\nWriting in the \"New Statesman\", Helen Lewis adds that in emphasizing internal differences over hegemonic structures, and having complex and at times contradictory recommendations, it can create paralysis because it is not very accessible.\n\nThe moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, in a speech at the American conservative think tank Manhattan Institute, criticized the theory by saying:[In intersectionality] the binary dimensions of oppression are said to be interlocking and overlapping. America is said to be one giant matrix of oppression, and its victims cannot fight their battles separately. They must all come together to fight their common enemy, the group that sits at the top of the pyramid of oppression: the straight, white, cis-gendered, able-bodied Christian or Jewish or possibly atheist male. This is why a perceived slight against one victim group calls forth protest from all victim groups. This is why so many campus groups now align against Israel. Intersectionality is like NATO for social-justice activists.\n\nBarbara Tomlinson is employed at the Department of Women's Studies at UC Santa Barbara and has been critical of the applications of intersectional theory. She has identified several ways in which the conventional theory has been destructive to the movement. She asserts that the common practice of using intersectionality to attack other ways of feminist thinking and the tendency of academics to critique intersectionality instead of using intersectionality as a tool to critique other conventional ways of thinking has been a misuse of the ideas it stands for. Tomlinson argues that in order to use intersectional theory correctly, intersectional feminists must not only consider the arguments but the tradition and mediums through which these arguments are made. Conventional academics are likely to favor writings by authors or publications with prior established credibility instead of looking at the quality of each piece individually, contributing to negative stereotypes associated with both feminism and intersectionality by having weaker arguments in defense of feminism and intersectionality become prominent based on renown. She goes on to argue that this allows critics of intersectionality to attack these weaker arguments, \"[reducing] intersectionality's radical critique of power to desires for identity and inclusion, and offer a deradicalized intersectionality as an asset for dominant disciplinary discourses\".\n\nSharon Goldman of the Israel-America Studies Program at Shalem College also criticized intersectionality on the basis of its being too simplistic. Goldman stipulates that many of the people championed by intersectionality truly are victims of oppression, but her reading of the ideology is that it favors the powerless over the powerful regardless of context. Any group that overcomes adversity, achieves independence, or defends itself successfully is seen as corrupt or imperialist by intersectionality adherents. The examples Goldman gives are American Jews who, inspired by the abject victimhood of the Holocaust, engaged in politics to successfully advance their ideas into the American mainstream. American Jews are not given the benefit of the doubt by intersectionality adherents because they proudly reject victimization.\n\nLisa Downing argues that because intersectionality focuses too much on group identities, which can lead it to ignore the fact that people are individuals, not just members of a class. Ignoring this can cause intersectionality to lead to a simplistic analysis and inaccurate assumptions about how a person's values and attitudes are determined.\n\nResearchers in psychology have incorporated intersection effects since the 1950s. These intersection effects were based on studying the lenses of biases, heuristics, stereotypes, and judgments. Psychologists have extended research in psychological biases to the areas of cognitive and motivational psychology. What is found, is that every human mind has its own biases in judgment and decision-making that tend to preserve the status quo by avoiding change and attention to ideas that exist outside one's personal realm of perception. Psychological interaction effects span a range of variables, although person-by-situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy. Even if an objective definition of oppression was reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed. For instance, black men are stereotypically perceived as violent, which may be a disadvantage in police interactions, but also as physically attractive, which may be advantageous in romantic situations.\n\nPsychological studies have shown that the effect of multiplying \"oppressed\" identities is not necessarily additive, but rather interactive in complex ways. For instance, black gay men may be more positively evaluated than black heterosexual men, because the \"feminine\" aspects of gay stereotypes temper the hypermasculine and aggressive aspect of black stereotypes.\n\nAlan Dershowitz, scholar of United States constitutional law and criminal law in answering a question on the criticism of Israel by intersectional movements, he stated that the concept of intersectionality is an oversimplification of reality that makes LGBT activists stand in solidarity with advocates of Sharia, even though Islamic law denies the rights of the former. He feels that identity politics does not evaluate ideas or individuals on the basis of the quality of their character. Dershowitz argues that in academia, intersectionality is taught with a large influence from antisemitism. He states that Jews are actually more liberal and supportive of equal rights than many other religious sects.\n\nWriter and political pro-Israel activist Chloé Valdary considers intersectionality \"a rigid system for determining who is virtuous and who is not, based on traits like skin color, gender, and financial status\". Valdary also states:Intersectionality's greatest flaw is in reducing human beings to political abstractions, which is never a tendency that turns out well—in part because it so severely flattens our complex human experience, and therefore fails to adequately describe reality. As it turns out, one can be personally successful and still come from a historically oppressed community—or vice versa. The human experience is complex and multifaceted and deeper than the superficial ways in which intersectionalists describe it.\n\nConservative political commentator Andrew Sullivan argues that the practice of intersectionality \"manifests itself almost as a religion. It posits a classic orthodoxy through which all of human experience is explained—and through which all speech must be filtered.\" David A. French, writer for the \"National Review\", states that proponents of intersectionality are \"zealots of a new religious faith\" intending to fill a \"religion-shaped hole in the human heart\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1943645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943645", "title": "Gus G", "text": "Gus G\n\nKonstantinos Karamitroudis ( born 12 September 1980), also known as Gus G, is a Greek heavy metal guitarist. He currently plays with his band Firewind. He has also played in Mystic Prophecy, Nightrage, Arch Enemy, Dream Evil and for Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nKonstantinos was born on 12 September 1980 in Thessaloniki, Greece. His father was a part-time singer who sang Greek folk music at bars and taverns. He was also a fan of rock music. He was introduced to bands like Pink Floyd, Santana and the Eagles by his father's album collections. Gus G. was inspired to start playing guitar after listening to his father's copy of Peter Frampton's album \"Frampton Comes Alive\". Gus has stated, \"Frampton Comes Alive, specifically, was the reason why I picked up the guitar and started playing.\" He was drawn in particular by Frampton's use of the Talkbox. Gus stated, \"I was like 8 or 9 years old and my dad had the vinyl at home and was playing that song 'Do You Feel Like We Do,' and when he was doing all that talkbox effects and making the guitar talk...I somehow thought it was a robot talking...I was just amazed by it. It was one of those epiphanies we get in life.\" At the age of 10, Gus asked his dad for a guitar. His father bought him a classical guitar and he started to take lessons from a local music school. When he finally received his first electric guitar at the age of 14, he got heavily into practicing and took lessons from a rock guitar teacher at a local conservatory.\n\nThe stage name \"Gus G.\" has two sources of origin. \"Gus\" is a common Greek American English translation of the name \"Kostas,\" and \"G\" was a nickname given to him by a friend during his time living in the US.\n\nAt the age of 18 he left Greece to enroll in the Berklee College of Music, but left after only a few weeks and began working on making a name on the metal scene. During his brief time at Berklee Gus came into contact with Joe Stump, who he credits as a great influence on his career. In 1998, Gus G. decided to record a demo with some close musician friends in the United States. The project was entitled Firewind, and was used as a showcase for Gus's guitar skills in an attempt to earn a professional recording deal. The demo attracted the attention of Leviathan Records, but activity was put on hold when Gus was hired by Nightrage, Dream Evil, and Mystic Prophecy. After the release of these bands' debut albums, Gus's attention returned to his band, Firewind. The band has released seven studio albums to date and has gone through many lineup changes. Gus G. was declared third of the three best guitar players all over the world in 2003 by the Japanese magazine \"BURRN!\".\n\nIn July 2005, he temporarily replaced Christopher Amott as guitarist of melodic death metal band Arch Enemy on their Ozzfest dates, and also contributed to their album \"Doomsday Machine\" by playing lead guitar on the song \"Taking Back my Soul\". He has made guest appearances for various artists, including the title track song on Rob Rock's \"Garden of Chaos\", as well as solos on the songs \"Felonies of the Christian Art\" and \"Life Deprived\" by Old Man's Child's album \"In Defiance of Existence\". Gus has also performed a few solos on the album \"Gallows Gallery\" by the Japanese avant-garde black metal band Sigh).\n\nIn 2009, Gus was sent an email invitation from Ozzy Osbourne's management to learn several songs and take a flight to Los Angeles to audition for the role of guitarist in Ozzy Osbourne's backing band. After jamming with the band, Gus was \"asked on the spot to come back and perform a concert with Ozzy a couple of months later\". Soon thereafter it was announced that Gus G. would be taking the place of lead guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy had decided to part ways with longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde, because he thought his music was beginning to sound too much like Zakk's band Black Label Society. Gus's first live appearance with Ozzy was at the BlizzCon 2009.\nIn 2010 Gus G. appeared alongside Firewind in Issue 3 of the Eternal Descent Comic Book which is an epic comic series that features characters of several of ESP Guitars' most popular artists.\n\nIn the Summer of 2012 he toured with Ozzy Osbourne as part of the Ozzy & Friends European Tour. The line-up featured special guests Slash, Zakk Wylde, and Geezer Butler. \nHe then returned to his band Firewind, and they released their 7th studio album \"Few Against Many\". The world tour that followed took them all over Europe, UK, North America, Asia and Australia.\nIn the midst of the tour, Firewind's longtime singer, Apollo Papathanasio, quit the band. Firewind vowed to continue with a replacement singer. At the end of the world tour in December 2013, Firewind decided to go on an indefinite hiatus and Gus G launched his solo career with the release of his debut album, \"I Am The Fire\". The album was released in March 2014 and features many guest musicians including Jacob Bunton Mats Levén, Jeff Scott Soto, Michael Starr of Steel Panther, Alexia Rodriguez of Eyes Set To Kill, Devour the Day and many more. \nHe toured in Europe extensively throughout 2014 together with Marty Friedman and in his native Greece with legendary guitarist Uli Jon Roth.\n\nIn February 2015, Gus stated that he had written all the songs for a solo album with an intended summer release. He also noted that another Firewind album was not planned due to the lack of a suitable singer. On 24 July his second solo album, \"Brand New Revolution\" was released in Europe through Century Media. Once again, the album features collaborations with guests like Jacob Bunton Mats Leven, Elize Ryd of Amaranthe and Jeff Scott Soto.\n\nThe tour that followed took Gus all over Europe as special guest of Kamelot, but he also headlined his own tours in North America and visited Japan and South Korea for the first time as solo artist.\n\nGus G's first influences began with Peter Frampton and his work \"Frampton Comes Alive\". When asked about Uli Jon Roth, Gus G. stated, \"'He's a guy that I took my band's name (Firewind) from. If you listen to Uli Jon Roth, what he was doing back in the 70s with the Scorpions, and of course, with Electric Sun, you'll see, \"Ohh, now I know where all the 80s shredders like Yngwie and all those guys got their inspiration from. He's an original for me. He's like a true original like Blackmore. He's a mentor, a friend, and a guitar idol of mine.\"' Gus also cites Al Di Meola, Joe Stump, John Norum, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Yngwie Malmsteen, George Lynch,\nUli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Paul Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Gary Moore, The Beatles, The Doors, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Joe Satriani and many others as his influences.\n\nIn 2005, Gus teamed up with ESP Guitars to make two custom model guitars to his specifications, the \"Gus G. FR\" and the \"Gus G. NT\". The 'NT' was used in the videos for \"Falling to Pieces\", \"Breaking the Silence\" and \"Tyranny\". The 'FR' is featured along with the NT model in the video for \"Falling to Pieces\" and \"Head Up High\" and was discontinued in 2009 for North America, being replaced by the 'NT'. In a 2009 video of Gus playing backstage at Musikmesse Frankfurt with his new T2 amplifier, he is seen with a white ESP Gus model with a black Firewind logo on the front. Before using ESP, he was endorsed by Washburn, playing a Culprit with a chrome pickguard, and before using a Fender Floyd Stratocaster.\nRecently Gus has released 2 new signature series guitars in Japan the ESP GUS G.

NT ESP, the only change made is to the frets who are now the same as at the ESP GUS G. NT-II.

Currently he uses DR Dragon Skins 10-14-18-32-42-56. He currently uses Dunlop Jazz III XL 1,5mm guitar picks.\n\nGus has used various amps in the past including Randall T2 and V2 Amplifiers.\nGus briefly had a signature Randall amp designed by him and based on the T2 head named \"Heaven and Hell\". It featured 2 channels, each using independent gain and tone controls. Gus G here performs with Ozzy using 10 of his Signature Randall T2HH amps and cabs.\n\nIn January 2010, he teamed up and was featured on the Blackstar Amplification website using the Series One 200 head and matching cab.\n\nIn June 2010, Blackstar Amplification launched a Gus G. signature pedal HT-BLACKFIRE at Summer NAMM. The HT-BLACKFIRE is a two channel, valve-driven, metal distortion pedal and was launched at Summer NAMM in Nashville on 18 June 2010. However live he does not play this, rather he uses a BBE Green Screamer.\n\nIn September 2011, Blackstar announced they were working on a Gus G signature Series One amplifier. This was announced at a Blackstar, Andertons and Gus G masterclass session at The Boileroom in Guildford. The signature amp was released in 2012 and was named BLACKFIRE 200 based on the Series One 200 amp. It was made available at the limited number of 225 amps worldwide.\n\nA detailed gear diagram of Gus G's 2011 Ozzy Osbourne guitar rig is well-documented. It is based on a 2011 interview with Gus G's guitar tech, Chet Haun.\n\n2016 saw Gus G switching to Jackson Guitars shortly before heading out on his North American tour with Angel Vivaldi. They were based on the star design originally created by Wayne Charvel in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A signature guitar line with Jackson was revealed at NAMM 2016.\n\nhttps://www.blackstaramps.com/uk/ranges/signature-series Gus G.

White and golden sandy beaches occupy approximately 130 km of the 378 km long coast. The region is an important center of tourism during the summer season (May–October), drawing millions of foreign and local tourists alike and constituting one of the country's most popular tourist destinations. Prior to 1989 the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was internationally known as the \"Red Riviera\". Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, however, its nickname has been changed to the \"Bulgarian Riviera\".\n\nThe Bulgarian Black Sea Coast has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfa\"), with considerable maritime and continental influences. The area's average air temperature in the summer is about 28 °C, with the average water temperature at 26 °C. There are more than 240 hours of sunshine in May and September and more than 300 hours in July and August.\n\nThe Balkan Mountains cross the country reaching to the edge of the Black Sea at Cape Emine, dividing the coastline into a southern and northern part. Parts of Bulgaria's northern Black Sea Coast feature rocky headlands where the sea abuts cliffs up to 70 metres in height. The southern coast is known for its wide sandy beaches. The southernmost section is included in Strandzha Nature Park.\n\nThe two largest cities and main seaports on the Bulgarian Riviera are Varna (third largest in the country) and Burgas (fourth largest in the country). Varna is located on the northern part of the coast and Burgas is located on the southern coast. The two cities' international airports, Varna Airport and Burgas Airport, are the main hubs servicing the region. In addition, the Trakia motorway (A1) was completed in 2013, providing fast access between Burgas and Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, and Plovdiv, the second largest city. Hemus motorway (A2), scheduled to be completed after 2020, would make the trip from Sofia to Varna substantially easier and faster, while the Cherno More motorway (A5) is planned to connect Varna and Burgas. Major road I-9 runs along the Black Sea coast between the border with Romania, at the village of Durankulak, and the city of Burgas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Själö is part of the municipality of Pargas. The island is known for its church and nature, a research institute and a former hospital.\n\nThere is another Själö in Väståboland, on the border between the former municipalities of Houtskär and Iniö.\n\nAn asteroid (1492 RM) has been named after the island.\n\nThe Finnish name of the island, \"Seili\", is a corruption of the Swedish \"Själö\" ('seal island' in English, \"själ\" being the old form of \"säl\", or seal). The name indicates that the island has been a retreat for seals and an attraction for seal hunters in early times. Actually Själö, then and at least until the 18th century, comprised two islands separated by a shallow strait, which has disappeared because of the land rising from the sea, an after-effect of glacial compression during the last ice age.\n\nThe first hospital on Själö was established in the 1620s. Before that there were two farms on the islands belonging to the Crown and thus available when the authorities looked for a suitable island to which the leper hospital at the outskirts of Turku could be moved.\n\nAccording to a Royal Decree in 1619 by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, the buildings of the hospital in Turku, with the exception of the chapel, were burned down and the inmates transported to Själö. The Själö hospital for lepers was dedicated to St George. The last leper patient died in 1785, and the establishment on Själö became a hospital or a place of confinement for mentally afflicted people until 1962. The hospital was self-sufficient with agriculture, and fishing. The present-day buildings on the island, with the exception of the chapel (built 1733) and the rectory (built 1791), date from the 19th and the 20th centuries, and most of them have been built for the mental hospital.

His teacher Sir Charles Villiers Stanford considered him the most talented of his pupils, above Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst.\n\nBorn at 12 Richmond Gardens (now Empress Place) Fulham, on 7 January 1876, Hurlstone was the grandson of Frederick Yeates Hurlstone, president of the Royal Society of British Artists, and only son of the four children of Martin de Galway Hurlstone, a surgeon, by his wife Maria Bessy Styche, a piano teacher.\n\nHurlstone's earliest musical education was with his mother. In 1883 the family moved to Bemerton, a village near Salisbury where he became chorister in the local church, until his asthma prevented him from carrying on singing. The vicar was so impressed with him that he invited Hubert Parry and George Grove from the Royal College of Music to meet him. Parry told his parents that he was taken more by their son's grasp of the subject than by his abilities as an executant. Grove was amazed by the boy's capacity to identify chords played on the piano among other tests. Young William's earliest compositions for the piano were at age nine, and were so convincing that his father arranged for them to be published.\n\nAt age eighteen, two years after his father's premature death from smallpox, Hurlstone won a scholarship to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music, after writing a Trio for Clarinet, Bassoon and Piano, performed at his local church. His piano professors in Croydon were Algernon Ashton and Edward Dannreuther. At the Royal College, his composition teacher, Sir Charles Villiers Stanford, considered Hurlstone to have been the most talented of the many brilliant students he taught. Those also included Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Frank Bridge, John Ireland, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Haydn Wood.\n\nAfter completing his studies Hurlstone settled in South Norwood to be near his family and worked as a piano teacher and choir master to help the family finances. He also taught at the Croydon Conservatoire. He retained links with Croydon for the rest of his life despite moving to Battersea to be nearer his work. The family suffered financial difficulties after their father, Martin, caught smallpox from one of his patients and went blind. He was obliged to give up his work and died shortly after in 1892. William was 16 years old. A musician friend of the family, named Beaumont, became their benefactor and saved them from penury.\n\nIn 1904 he was highly commended for \"Variations on a Swedish Air\", performed at the first Patrons' Concert. In 1905 he won first prize in the Cobbett competition for a single-movement String Quartet. One of his former teachers, Walford Davies, appointed him accompanist to the Bach Choir. In 1906, Hurlstone returned to the college as one of the youngest appointmentees as Professor of Counterpoint, but died later that year of bronchial asthma, from which he had suffered all his life.\n\nHe is buried in Croydon Cemetery with members of his family. The monument over William's grave was designed as a broken column to signify that he had died before reaching his peak. A street in South Norwood was named after Hurlstone; his mother had lived in Selhurst Road nearby as did his musician friend, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.\n\nThe greater part of Hurlstone's body of work consists of works for chamber ensembles. Although they are of consistently high quality, none achieved any great fame, but the Bassoon Sonata has become particularly popular along with the Characteristic Pieces for Clarinet and Piano.

{"id": "1943681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943681", "title": "John R. Lynch", "text": "John R. Lynch\n\nJohn Roy Lynch (September 10, 1847 – November 2, 1939) was a Black Republican politician, writer, attorney and military officer. Born into slavery in Louisiana, he became free in 1863 under the Emancipation Proclamation. His father was an Irish immigrant and his parents had a common-law marriage. After serving for several years in the state legislature, in 1873 Lynch was elected as the first African-American Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives; he was the first Black man (considered so) to hold this position in the country. During Reconstruction after the American Civil War, he was among the first generation of African Americans from the South elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1873 to 1877 and again in the 1880s. Faced with increasing restrictions in Mississippi, Lynch studied law, passed the bar, and returned to Washington, DC to set up a practice.\n\nAfter Democrats regained power in the state legislature following Reconstruction, in 1890 they disenfranchised most blacks in the state (who were a majority of the population) by a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Then in his 50s, Lynch studied law; he was admitted to the Mississippi bar in 1896. Seeing the effects of disenfranchisement, Lynch left the state and returned to Washington, DC to practice law. He served in the United States Army during the Spanish–American War and for a decade into the early 1900s, achieving the rank of major. After retiring, Lynch moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he lived for more than two decades. After his military service, Lynch was active in law and real estate in Chicago.\n\nBeginning in 1877, when Reconstruction ended with the federal government withdrawing its troops from the South, Lynch wrote and published four books: these analyzed the political situation in the South during and after Reconstruction. He is best known for his book, \"The Facts of Reconstruction\" (1913). It is available online at the Gutenberg Project. In it, he argued against the prevailing view of the Dunning School, conservative white historians who downplayed African-American contributions and the achievements of the Reconstruction era. Lynch emphasized how significant was the ratification of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which granted full citizenship to all persons without restriction of race or color, and suffrage to minority males.\n\nJohn R. Lynch was born into slavery in 1847 on Tacony Plantation near Vidalia, Concordia Parish, Louisiana. He was the third son of his mother Catherine White, who was enslaved. She had four boys in total. Born in Virginia, she was of mixed race, as were both of her parents, Robert and Elizabeth White. Under slavery law, the children of slave mothers were slaves, regardless of paternity. John's father Patrick Lynch was the overseer on the plantation; he had a common-law marriage with Catherine White. A young immigrant, Patrick Lynch had come to the United States with his family from Dublin, Ireland. They settled in Zanesville, Ohio.\n\nAs young men, Patrick and his older brother Edward Lynch moved South; Patrick became an overseer at the Tacony Plantation. There he fell in love with Catherine and they became a couple, living together as man and wife. (They were prohibited from marrying by state law.)\n\nTo protect his family, Patrick Lynch planned to buy Catherine and their mixed-race sons from the Tacony Plantation owner. Before the transaction was completed, a new owner bought the plantation and hired a different manager. Lynch could no longer afford to post the $1,000 bond required by the legislature for each person in his family in order to free them. (The state legislature was trying to reduce the number of free people of color, and it severely restricted the number of manumissions, ending approval altogether in 1852.) In addition, he would have to submit a request for these manumissions to an Emancipation Court.\n\nLynch planned to move with his family to New Orleans, where his brother Edward lived, and try to save money there to secure his family's freedom. He thought the city would be a good place to live, as he had learned that it had a large population of free people of color. Many had achieved some education and economic status. Lynch died in 1849 of illness before carrying out his plan.\n\nBefore his death, Patrick Lynch arranged for his friend, William G. Deal, to take title of Catherine, William and John, with the understanding that this was a legality to protect the family, who continued to work at Tacony plantation. But after a time, Deal sold them to Alfred Vidal Davis, a planter in Natchez, Mississippi. When she met Davis, Catherine was shocked to learn of the sale. She told him her family's story. Davis offered to keep her and her two sons with her (one had died by this time), and to have her work in his household. He also allowed her to hire out and save some of the money she earned. He mostly kept his word, but Catherine and her two sons did not gain freedom until 1863, under the Emancipation Proclamation. Because of an argument with Mrs. Davis, the boy John Lynch had been sent to field labor on the plantation. He was 16 when he and his family gained freedom.\n\nLynch worked with elements of the Union Army in the Natchez area. After the Civil War ended in 1865, a friend of his father's arranged for him to work for a photographer. Lynch took on increased responsibilities until he managed the entire operation and its finances. He built a successful business in Natchez. Wanting to continue his education, Lynch attended a night school taught by Northerners. (By the end of 1866, many such teachers were driven out of the state by whites' violent opposition to the education of freedmen.) Lynch also read widely in books and newspapers during lulls in his business day. As Lynch's business was near a white school, the young man often eavesdropped on lessons through the open windows.\n\nLynch's leadership abilities were quickly recognized in Natchez, and he gained post-war political opportunities. He became active in the Republican Party by the age of 20. Although too young to participate as a delegate, he attended the state's constitutional convention of 1867, studying its developments closely. The first proposed constitution was defeated, largely because it required the temporary disenfranchisement of former Confederates, an unpopular proposal.\n\nIn April 1869 at the age of 22, Lynch was appointed by the military governor, Adelbert Ames, as a Justice of the Peace in Natchez. Later that year Lynch was elected as a Republican to the Mississippi State House. He was re-elected, serving until 1873. In his last term, January 1872 he was elected as Speaker of the Mississippi House, the first African American to achieve that position.\n\nAt the age of 26 in 1872, Lynch was elected as the youngest member of the US Congress from Mississippi's 6th congressional district, as part of the first generation of African-American Congressmen. (This district was created by the state legislature in 1870.) He was the only African American elected from Mississippi for a century.\n\nIn 1874 Lynch was the only Republican in the Mississippi House delegation to be elected in the face of a Democratic campaign against Republicans and blacks. Elections in the state were increasingly accompanied by violence and fraud as Democrats worked to regain political power. In 1874, the White League, a white paramilitary group active on behalf of the Democratic Party, had worked openly to intimidate and suppress black voting, assassinating blacks and running Republican officers out of town. In 1875 Democrats dominated the House of Representatives for the first time since the Civil War.\n\nLynch introduced many bills and argued on their behalf. Perhaps his greatest effort was in the long debate supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to ban discrimination in public accommodations. He was one of seven African-American Congressmen present, who all testified in 1874 as to personal and known experience of the effects of discrimination in this area.\n\nAnother speech included the following:\n\nIn 1876 Lynch spoke out against the White League and racial divisions in his state. The Democratic Party dominated the state legislature, redrawing his district and guaranteeing white majorities in the other five. Lynch contested the victory of Democrat James R. Chalmers from the 6th district, but, with Congress dominated by Democrats, the Elections Committee refused to hear the case. As a result of a national Democratic Party compromise, in 1877 the federal government withdrew its troops from the South, and Reconstruction was considered ended. The Democrats kept control of the state legislature.\n\nIn 1880 Lynch re-entered politics. He ran against Democrat James R. Chalmers from the 6th district and contested his claim of victory in the majority-black 6th district.\nWhen his case came before the Committee on Elections on April 27, 1882, Lynch argued that in five counties, more than 5,000 of his votes had been counted for Chalmers. He further asserted that several thousand Republican ballots had been thrown out after a secret hearing because of technicalities such as a clerical failure to send a list of names with the returns and the presence of unusual marks on the ballots. Lynch's strongest arguments were based on Chalmers's remarks that Lynch's votes had been thrown out and that he (Chalmers) was 'in favor of using every means short of violence to preserve [for] intelligent white people of Mississippi supreme control of political affairs.' The committee ruled in Lynch's favor, and on April 29, 1882, the House voted 125 to 83 to seat him; 62 Members abstained.\n\nLynch was awarded the seat by Congress in 1882.\n\nHe had little time to campaign and lost re-election in 1882 by 600 votes, ending his career in Congress. He continued to have influence in Mississippi and in the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1884, Lynch became the first African American to chair a political party's National Convention. Future president Theodore Roosevelt made a moving speech nominating Lynch as Temporary Chairman of the 1884 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. Lynch served as a member of the Republican National Committee for Mississippi from 1884 to 1889.\n\nIn 1884, at the age of 37, Lynch married Ella Sommerville; they had a daughter before divorcing. Years later, in 1911, after Lynch retired from the Army, he married again, to Cora Williams. They left Mississippi the following year, part of the Great Migration to Northern industrial cities, and settled in Chicago. They lived there until Lynch's death in 1939.\n\nLynch was appointed by the Republican national administration as Treasury Auditor of the Department of Navy (1889-1893). He returned to Mississippi after this and studied law; he passed the state bar in 1896. As the state legislature had disenfranchised blacks by its new 1890 constitution, based on poll taxes and literacy tests, Lynch returned to Washington, DC the following year to set up his law practice. He wanted to live where he could participate politically.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War, Lynch was commissioned in 1898 as a major and appointed as paymaster in the Army by President William McKinley. In 1901, Lynch entered the Regular Army as a captain. He was promoted to major and served tours of duty in the United States, Cuba, and the Philippines.\n\nAfter Lynch retired from the Army in 1911, he married again and moved to Chicago in 1912. There he set up his law practice. He also became involved in real estate, as the city became a destination of tens of thousands of rural blacks in the Great Migration, including many from Mississippi. It was also attracting European immigrants and rapidly expanding based on its industrial jobs.\n\nAfter his death in Chicago in 1939 at the age of 92, Lynch was buried with military honors in Arlington National Cemetery, due his service as a Congressman and military officer.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the struggle for memory and meaning of the Civil War and Reconstruction continued. Lynch wrote a book, \"The Facts of Reconstruction\" (1913), and several articles criticizing the then-dominant Dunning School of historiography. Dunning and followers, many of whom were prominent in major Southern universities, evaluated Reconstruction largely from the viewpoint of white former slave owners and ex-Confederates; they expressed the discriminatory views of their societies. They routinely downplayed any positive contributions of African Americans during Reconstruction, said they were dominated by white carpetbaggers, and could not manage political power. (This was in keeping with the disfranchisement of blacks throughout the former Confederacy from 1890 to 1910, and the imposition by state legislatures of racial segregation and Jim Crow law to restore white supremacy.)\n\nLynch argued that blacks had made substantial contributions during the period. He also published articles on this topic in 1917 and 1918 in the \"Journal of Negro History.\" His views were later supported by historians such as W.E.B. Du Bois in his \"Black Reconstruction in America\" (1935) and Eric Foner in \"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877\" (1988), among others. Since the late 20th century, new histories and research have changed the perception of the achievements during Reconstruction.\n\n\"The Facts of Reconstruction\" is freely available online, courtesy of the Gutenberg Project. Since Lynch participated directly in Reconstruction-era governments, historians consider his book to be a primary source in study of the period.\n\nLynch's memoir, \"Reminiscences of an Active Life: The Autobiography of John Roy Lynch,\" which he worked on near the end of his life, was not published until 1970. A number of chapters dealing with Reconstruction are close to material published first in his 1913 \"The Facts of Reconstruction.\" A new edition of his memoir was issued by the University of Mississippi Press in 2008.

{"id": "1943686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943686", "title": "Thelma Harper", "text": "Thelma Harper\n\nThelma Mae Harper (nee Crowley), also known as Mama, is a fictional character played by American actress Vicki Lawrence. She is a senior citizen who has lived in an unspecified part in the Southern United States for her entire life which is evident by the southern drawl of her speech and her customs. She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence originated the Mama character which first appeared in \"The Family\" sketches on \"The Carol Burnett Show\" (1974–78) and \"Carol Burnett & Company\" (1979); \"Eunice\" was a 1982 made-for-TV movie based on \"The Family\" sketches characters; \"Mama's Family\" (first on NBC 1983–84, then revolutionized in first-run syndication 1986–90); and finally in the ongoing \"Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show\". With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the \"Mama\" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on \"Password Plus\", \"Hollywood Squares\"; \"The Talk\"; \"\"Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular\"\" (2007); \"\"Betty White's 2nd Annual 90th Birthday\"\" (February 5, 2013); \"The Queen Latifah Show\" (May 20, 2014) etc.\n\nLawrence performed on \"The Carol Burnett Show\" for eleven seasons. In the seventh season in 1974, \"The Family\" skit was created, which debuted the \"Mama\" role. Four years after \"The Carol Burnett\" show ended, the TV-movie-special \"Eunice\" (the character of Mama's daughter) was broadcast. The special included the key characters from \"The Family\" sketches, including Mama. The skit was spun off again with a sitcom that surrounded the \"Mama\" character. \"Mama's Family\" has two contrasting lives. This is as result of the show's cancellation from NBC after one and a half seasons (1983 to 1984). In 1986, the program was relaunched in first-run syndication, where it enjoyed a highly successful second life all the way to its series finale in 1990.\n\nBy the \"Mama\" character's full development on the second life of \"Mama's Family\", Thelma had spent much of her time tending to the housework and nurturance of her loved ones, constantly engaged in cooking, cleaning, and providing loving support to her family. She ruled the roost with a smart mouth and snappy retorts; an explosively quick temper; and a brash, rough and abrasive manner. Mama often relaxed with a can of beer, and when upset, would frequently incorporate a purse whack, an object slam, a shove, a startling shout, or a healthy dose of wisecracking insults and criticisms at her target.\"\n\nCarol Burnett was originally supposed to play the \"Mama\" character while Lawrence was to play her daughter, but because of Burnett's desire to swap roles, Lawrence played Mama. In her autobiography, Vicki called Thelma \"the only role which I got to go to makeup to get ugly!\" It is Lawrence's most well-known role.\n\nMama's appearance is based on that of a stereotypical elderly woman. She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on \"Mama's Family\" was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping apron. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of \"Mama's Family\"; she wore no support hose during \"The Family\" sketches nor the \"Eunice\" movie. For footwear, Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a high heeled brogue style.\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few fashion accessories: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral headpieces; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between \"The Family\" sketches and the first life of \"Mama's Family\". Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.\n\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice. Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from Missouri in the genesis of Mama.\n\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is \"\"Good Lord!\"\" also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as \"\"Good Lord in heaven!\"\" or \"\"Good night Louise!\"\" Among her other locutions included \"\"Now hear this!\"\" \"\"Hell's bells!\"\" \"\"God-awful!\"\" \"\"The hell you say,\"\" \"\"Smut,\"\" \"\"For heaven's sake!\"\" \"\"For crying out loud!\"\" \"\"In a pig's eye,\"\" \"\"Shoot!\"\" \"\"Real good,\"\" \"\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"\" etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as \"\"Nitwit,\"\" \"\"Dimwit,\"\" \"\"Goon,\"\" \"\"Goober Goon,\"\" \"\"Lamebrain,\"\" \"\"Dunce,\"\" \"\"Tramp,\"\" etc.\n\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of \"Mama's Family\", the supporting characters in the second life of \"Mama's Family\" weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of \"Mama's Family\" was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\nIn \"The Family\" sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: Ellen, Eunice, Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked plotholes as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In \"Mama's Family\", they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by Vinton. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an unseen character, portrayed in voice only. In the movie \"Eunice\" Carl was voiced by Dick Clair and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, Ed, was the ongoing theme of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nIn \"Mama's Family\", Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer Fran Crowley. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and Sonja Harper, move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to Las Vegas to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries Naomi Harper, Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, Iola Boylan, who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the NBC episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma \"do\" have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: \"\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"\") Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, \"\"Get the hell out of my life!\"\"\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on \"Jeopardy!\" While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, Alberta Meechum, who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later Marge Redmond), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is illiterate. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend Lloyd Meechum, the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire dysfunctional family move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor Alvin Tutweiler's chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show \"Hollywood Squares\", on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled \"Mama for President\".\n\nThelma also appeared on \"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\" on October 2, 2009 playing for charity. She ended up winning $8,000 USD, getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's \"\" as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch. Later seen out of the Thelma persona, Vicki Lawrence played as a special guest judge to the contestants alongside RuPaul.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Thelma appeared in a special sketch during \"Betty White's 2nd Annual 90th Birthday\" in honor of Betty White. The sketch features a Beverly Hills high school class reunion with three of Betty's \"classmates\" from 1939. The sketch has a run time just over two minutes.\n\nMeTV's insertion of \"Mama's Family\" into their 2015–2016 schedule also brought with it several new video spots of Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, used for bumpers and promotional commercials on the network.\n"}
{"id": "1943687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943687", "title": "Music Box (Mariah Carey album)", "text": "Music Box (Mariah Carey album)\n\nMusic Box is the third studio album by American singer Mariah Carey. It was released by Columbia Records on August 31, 1993, in North America. The album comprises ballads primarily co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, with whom she had previously worked on \"Emotions\" (1991), and a few urban dance tracks. During the course of the album's development, Carey wanted to broaden her audience, choosing a more pop/R&B oriented sound. During this time frame, she experimented with different musical instruments, leading the album's sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts. Two unused tracks from the album sessions were released as B-sides: \"Do You Think of Me\" and \"Everything Fades Away\".\n\nIn order to successfully take the album in a new direction, Carey and Afanasieff sought out new and innovative producers, as well as some from Carey's previous releases. Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds first began working with Carey on \"Music Box\", where he helped produce some of the album's softer and more melodious tracks, as well as being part of the songwriting process. Additional writers and producers were Robert Clivillés and David Cole (a pair also known as C+C Music Factory) and Daryl Simmons. While the album featured a range of music producers, the bulk of the songwriting was done by Carey and her writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. In future projects, they would continue writing material for Carey's albums, until her 1999 release \"Rainbow\", where he is absent from the writing credits.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. The first three, \"Dreamlover\", \"Hero\" and \"Without You\", became worldwide chart-topping singles, the latter becoming Carey's highest charting international single of her career. \"Without You\" became Carey's first number-one single in most European markets and reached the top three in the United States. To promote \"Music Box\", Carey embarked on the short but successful Music Box Tour which traveled to select cities in North America. Carey was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Dreamlover\" at the 1994 Grammy Awards and received the same nomination for \"Hero\" at the 1995 Grammy Awards.\n\nAfter its release, \"Music Box\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow and lazy tone in comparison to her previous work. Commercially, the album reached number one in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Diamond, for shipments of ten million copies across the United States. \"Music Box\" remains Carey's highest seller with 28 million copies sold worldwide and is one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nIn 1988, Carey was discovered by Tommy Mottola, CEO of Columbia Records, and was promptly signed to the label. Carey's self-titled debut studio album, released in 1990, focused on re-recording and mastering several songs she had already written in high school alongside classmate, Ben Margulies. Aside from the seven songs taken from Carey's demo tape, four other tracks were written and produced by the former and an array of famed record producers. The album was complimented by critics, who called it a mature debut, full of various genre influences ranging from pop, R&B and soul. The album became a commercial success, selling fifteen million units globally. While making a strong impact on pop music, Carey became interested in altering her sound, and deviating from pop music for her second studio effort, \"Emotions\" (1991). Following the success of her debut, Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical departure, enabling her to change her genre infusions, melodies and production.\n\nWith Carey in the captain's chair, having more control than she had on any other album, she took the album in a new direction, alongside Afanasieff. For Carey's third studio effort, she enrolled the help of a range of songwriters, as well as record producers. Aside from Afanasieff, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, a man who would collaborate with Carey often in the near future, also took part in the project. Babyface, who helped produce much of the album, also co-wrote a track with Carey titled \"Never Forget You\", a song that was released as a B-side to \"Without You\" exclusively in the United States. The album, which consisted mostly of slower ballads (with the exception of \"Dreamlover\", \"Now That I Know\", and \"I've Been Thinking about You\"), contained collaborations with some carry-on producers and writers from \"Emotions\". Of these were Clivillés & Cole (of C+C Music Factory), who co-wrote the track \"Now That I Know\", a danceable pop ballad, which used similar formulas and synthesizers from tracks on \"Emotions\". Another writer–producer that worked on the album was David Hall, who with Carey wrote the U.S. single \"Dreamlover\".\n\nDuring the album's recording, Carey worked with several different musicians and producers, aside from Walter Afanasieff, the only hold over from her debut. On the album's first track \"Dreamlover\", Carey worked with Dave Hall throughout the song's entire production. In order to help with some of the song's arrangements, Mottola enrolled the help of Walter Afanasieff, who took on the completed track and transformed it into a more commercial hit.\n\n\"Emotions\" contains influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, as well as her continued work of R&B and soul. The album, while praised by some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R&B record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, \"Music Box\".\n\nOne of the noticeable differences from \"Music Box\" and Carey's previous albums is its sound. The album was described by Afanasieff as a softer and more pop-oriented album, \"filling the songs with air\", and allowing far more space in the overall sound. Another noticeable change is in the album's production. When \"Mariah Carey\" was released, critics took notice of its \"overly produced\" and \"studio perfect\" quality, where in comparison, \"Emotions\" maintains a \"raw, live sound.\" \"Music Box\" however, falls in between the two, a decision made by Carey during the album's production. She would layer each track with live backing vocals, so not to sound too overly produced, but still kept the inclusion of musical synthesizers.\n\nAccording to Marc Shapiro, \"Music Box\" reflects signs of Carey's vocal maturity, as well as representing an album she was truly proud of. The album's first single \"Dreamlover\" was described as a \"slight piece of pop fluff,\" representing a more commercial side to Carey than the \"more ambitious,\" \"Vision of Love\". Critics believed the song's chart performance was due to its summer release, as people were still looking for a \"not-too-heavy\" and more diverse sound. The song's composition was described as \"mid tempo and mildly dance-able,\" with Carey's voice being called \"perpetually happy,\" like a \"little-girl voice.\"\n\n\"Hero\", the album's second single, was one of Carey's most inspirational ballads at the time.\nThe song is described as \"a lush ballad\", with Carey making use of her impressive, \"lower alto register.\" As one of the more emotional tracks on the album, \"Hero\" builds emotion, verse through verse, where the lyrics and melody finally \"broke through.\" \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" is another pop ballad in which Carey would, \"let her voice roam free\", a feature critics felt lacked on the album. The song featured \"rough and low vocals\", as well as some glimpses of Carey's upper registers. As with most of the songs on \"Music Box\", the lyrics boast a positive message, and it is the only song on the album to feature traces of gospel-inspired vocals throughout the chorus.\n\nThe album's title track, \"Music Box\", is another ballad Carey wrote with Afanasieff. The song is described as one of Carey's more difficult compositions, due to its \"softness\". The song requires a great deal of legato to keep \"the tune's softness and sweetness, without resorting to volume.\" Carey's vocals on the track are defined as \"soft and controlled,\" managing to maintain the delicate balance in a manner that seems effortless, floating easily over the keyboard and the shimmer of the guitar. Lyrically, due to the song's message of \"commitment and promise,\" and the \"tinkling music-box line played on the synthesizer,\" the track gives the sensation of a wedding vow recital. \"Never Forget You\" is a slow song, further connecting it to the song's message of \"lamenting the loss of love, in a very tender way.\" The song contains keyboard notes that hover over the verses and allow Carey to indulge in her backing vocals. It was described by Nickson as a \"stand out track,\" one that could have easily become a hit single, \"with an appeal that would have easily transcended generational barriers.\"\n\nTo promote the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining concert tour, the Music Box Tour. Due to stage fright, Carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support \"Music Box\". However, after the continued success of the album and persuasion from Tommy Mottola, Carey agreed. Because Carey did not feel physically or emotionally ready for an extensive tour, six concerts were scheduled, each with many days in between, in order to give her voice time to rest. An extra performance at Proctor's Theatre was planned; there, Carey filmed the one-hour special \"Here Is Mariah Carey\" for release during the Christmas season.\n\nWhen tickets went on sale, the concerts did not sell out instantly but sold at a healthy pace. On the opening night, she sang at the Miami Arena. Approximately two-thirds of the venue's capacity was filled, which worried Carey's management. However, Carey did not seem to mind and began the show with high spirits. The first show in Miami received scathing reviews; subsequent shows sold out of tickets and attracted rave reviews.\n\nAside from touring for the first time in her career, Carey visited various American and European television programs, performing different singles from the album. In late 1993, Carey appeared on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", performing both \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero.\" Other 1993 performances included \"Hero\" on \"The Jay Leno Show\" and \"Dreamlover\" on her fourth visit to \"Top of the Pops\". Carey continued promoting the album in 1994, performing \"Without You\" on a fifth visit to \"Top of the Pops\", as well as visiting France, Germany, Japan, Spain and Sweden. In the midst of the Music Box Tour, Carey had already begun working with Walter Afanasieff on her holiday album \"Merry Christmas\", which was to be released during the Christmas season of 1994. Additionally, Carey and Affanasieff reportedly began experimenting with ideas and music for Carey's 1995 album \"Daydream\".\n\n\"Dreamlover\" was released as the album's first single on July 27, 1993. The single debuted at number thirteen on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and due to its massive airplay, the song reached the top of the Hot 100, staying there for eight weeks. \"Dreamlover\" topped the charts in Canada, and reached the top-ten in many other countries. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of one million copies, as well as receiving a Gold certification in Australia and New Zealand. The music video for \"Dreamlover\" featured \"summer scenery,\" with scenes of Carey swimming in a pool by a waterfall, lying in a bed of sunflowers, as well as singing in front of hip-hop dancers. The video tried to capture, a \"home video\" feel, adding to the song's subtle and airy nature, something that only helped the song dominate the charts \"Hero\" served as the album's second single, and was released on October 19, 1993. Music critics praised the song, calling it her most directly inspirational song since \"Make It Happen\". The song topped the charts in the United States and the top-five in many other major music markets. The music video for \"Hero,\" featured footage from Carey's concert at Proctor's Theatre, as was done for Carey's following music video for \"Without You.\"\n\n\"Without You\", the album's third single, became the biggest international hit of Carey's career. \"Without You\" reached number three in the United States, but experienced its real success throughout Europe. The song became Carey's first number-one single in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, propelling the sales of \"Music Box\" throughout the world. Carey brought the song renewed popularity, through her highly successful adaptation. It became one of the \"fifty most-played songs of the year\" and even outsold Harry Nilsson's version, receiving many awards and recognition. \"Anytime You Need a Friend\", the album's final single, experienced success on the charts, becoming Carey's first number-one single in Finland and reaching the top-ten in many countries, as well as peaking at number twelve in the United States. It became the second single in \"Music Box\" to perform better throughout Europe than in the U.S.\n\n\"Music Box\" received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found the performances uninvolved and devoid of substantial songwriting. In \"Rolling Stone\", Stephen Holden said the lyrics were \"made up entirely of pop and soul clichés\" on an album \"so precisely calculated to be a blockbuster that its impact is ultimately a little unnerving\". Christopher John Farley from \"Time\" called it \"perfunctory and almost passionless\" in spite of highlights in \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" and the title track. In \"Entertainment Weekly\", David Browne found Carey's performance low on energy and her voice no longer soaring above the backup chorus. Instead, he wrote in \"Entertainment Weekly\", she \"drips over them like syrup instead of overpowering them; she lets the melodies speak for themselves.\" Dennis Hunt was particularly critical in the \"Los Angeles Times\", writing that Carey's pop-soul songs still lacked emotion even though she had \"toned down her vocal showboating\". He accused \"Music Box\" of being geared toward an adult contemporary audience that \"likes its soul whitewashed and in small doses\". \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau labeled it a \"dud\", indicating \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought\".\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ron Wynn deemed \"Music Box\" \"partly successful\" and believed it was smart of Carey to explore her vocal approach differently, but she ended up sounding \"detached on several selections\". With the exception \"Hero\" and \"Dreamlover\", the other songs lacked her usual \"personality and intensity\", according to Wynn. \"Q\" was more impressed by the record, writing that \"this 1993 celebration of the all-conquering power of love was her defining moment\".\n\n\"Music Box\" entered the US \"Billboard\" 200 at number two, with 174,000 copies sold. In its fifteenth week after release, the album topped the chart and enjoyed its highest sales week in December, selling 295,000 copies in its first week atop, 395,000 the following week and peaking with 505,000 copies sold in year's final week. It stayed at the top for eight non-consecutive weeks.\nIt remained in the top ten for thirty-one weeks and on the \"Billboard\" 200 for 128 weeks (more than two years, longer than any other of her albums), re-entering the chart three times.

In this temperature range, a SMM exhibits magnetic hysteresis of purely molecular origin. In contrast to conventional bulk magnets and molecule-based magnets, collective long-range magnetic ordering of magnetic moments is not necessary.\n\nAlthough the term \"single-molecule magnet\" was first employed in 1996, the first single-molecule magnet, [MnO(OAc)(HO)] (nicknamed \"Mn\") was reported in 1991. This manganese oxide compound features a central Mn(IV)O cube surrounded by a ring of 8 Mn(III) units connected through bridging oxo ligands, and displays slow magnetic relaxation behavior up to temperatures of ca. 4 K.\n\nEfforts in this field primarily focus on raising the operating temperatures of single-molecule magnets to liquid nitrogen temperature or room temperature in order to enable applications in magnetic memory. Recent acceleration in this field of research has resulted in significant enhancements of single-molecule magnet operating temperatures to above 60 K.\n\nBecause of single-molecule magnets' magnetic anisotropy, the magnetic moment has usually only two stable orientations antiparallel to each other, separated by an energy barrier. The stable orientations define the molecule's so called “easy axis”. At finite temperature, there is a finite probability for the magnetization to flip and reverse its direction. Identical to a superparamagnet, the mean time between two flips is called the Néel relaxation time and is given by the following Néel–Arrhenius equation:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere:\n\n\nThis magnetic relaxation time, \"τ\", can be anywhere from a few nanoseconds to years or much longer.\n\nThe so-called magnetic blocking temperature, \"T\", is defined as the temperature below which the relaxation of the magnetization becomes slow compared to the time scale of a particular investigation technique. Historically, the blocking temperature for single-molecule magnets has been defined as the temperature at which the molecule's magnetic relaxation time, \"τ\", is 100 seconds. This definition is the current standard for comparison of single-molecule magnet properties, but otherwise is not technologically significant.\n\nThe magnetic coupling between the spins of the metal ions is mediated by superexchange interactions and can be described by the following isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian:\n\nwhere formula_3 is the coupling constant between spin \"i\" (operator formula_4) and spin \"j\" (operator formula_5). For positive \"J\" the coupling is called ferromagnetic (parallel alignment of spins) and for negative \"J\" the coupling is called antiferromagnetic (antiparallel alignment of spins): a high spin ground state, a high zero-field-splitting (due to high magnetic anisotropy), and negligible magnetic interaction between molecules.\n\nThe combination of these properties can lead to an energy barrier, so that at low temperatures the system can be trapped in one of the high-spin energy wells.\n\nThe performance of single-molecule magnets is typically defined by two parameters: the effective barrier to slow magnetic relaxation, \"U\", and the magnetic blocking temperature, \"T\". While these two variables are linked, only the latter variable, \"T\", directly reflects the performance of the single-molecule magnet in practical use. In contrast, \"U\", the thermal barrier to slow magnetic relaxation, only correlates to \"T\" when the molecule's magnetic relaxation behavior is perfectly Arrhenius in nature.\n\nThe table below lists representative and record 100-s magnetic blocking temperatures and \"U\" values that have been reported for single-molecule magnets. \n\nMetal clusters formed the basis of the first decade-plus of single-molecule magnet research, beginning with the archetype of single-molecule magnets, \"Mn\". This complex is a polymetallic manganese (Mn) complex having the formula [MnO(OAc)(HO)], where OAc stands for acetate. It has the remarkable property of showing an extremely slow relaxation of their magnetization below a blocking temperature. [MnO(OAc)(HO)]·4HO·2AcOH, which is called \"Mn-acetate\" is a common form of this used in research.\n\nSingle-molecule magnets are also based on iron clusters because they potentially have large spin states. In addition, the biomolecule ferritin is also considered a nanomagnet. In the cluster FeBr the cation Fe stands for [FeO(OH)(tacn)], with tacn representing 1,4,7-triazacyclononane.\n\nThe ferrous cube complex FeCHNO (commonly called [Fe(sae)(MeOH)]) was the first example of a single-molecule magnet involving an Fe(II) cluster, and the core of this complex is a slightly distorted cube with Fe and O atoms on alternating corners. Remarkably, this single-molecule magnet exhibits non-collinear magnetism, in which the atomic spin moments of the four Fe atoms point in opposite directions along two nearly perpendicular axes. Theoretical computations showed that approximately two magnetic electrons are localized on each Fe atom, with the other atoms being nearly nonmagnetic, and the spin–orbit-coupling potential energy surface has three local energy minima with a magnetic anisotropy barrier just below 3 meV.\n\nThere are many discovered types and potential uses. Single-molecule magnets represent a molecular approach to nanomagnets (nanoscale magnetic particles).\n\nDue to the typically large, bi-stable spin anisotropy, single-molecule magnets promise the realization of perhaps the smallest practical unit for magnetic memory, and thus are possible building blocks for a quantum computer. Consequently, many groups have devoted great efforts into synthesis of additional single-molecule magnets.\n\nIn addition, single-molecule magnets have provided physicists with useful test-beds for the study of quantum mechanics. Macroscopic quantum tunneling of the magnetization was first observed in MnO, characterized by evenly spaced steps in the hysteresis curve. The periodic quenching of this tunneling rate in the compound Fe has been observed and explained with geometric phases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1943760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943760", "title": "Structural anthropology", "text": "Structural anthropology\n\nStructural anthropology is a school of anthropology based on Claude Lévi-Strauss' idea that immutable deep structures exist in all cultures, and consequently, that all cultural practices have homologous counterparts in other cultures, essentially that all cultures are equitable.\n\nLévi-Strauss' approach arose in large part from dialectics expounded on by Marx and Hegel, though dialectics (as a concept) dates back to Ancient Greek philosophy. Hegel explains that every situation presents two opposing things and their resolution; Fichte had termed these \"thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.\" Lévi-Strauss argued that cultures also have this structure. He showed, for example, how opposing ideas would fight and were resolved to establish the rules of marriage, mythology and ritual. This approach, he felt, made for fresh new ideas. He stated:\n\nIn South America he showed that there are \"dual organizations\" throughout Amazon rainforest cultures, and that these \"dual organizations\" represent opposites and their synthesis. As an illustration, Gê tribes of the Amazon were found to divide their villages into two rival halves; however, members from each half married each other, resolving the opposition\n\nCulture, he claimed, has to take into account both life and death and needs to have a way of mediating between the two. Mythology (see his several-volume \"Mythologies\") unites opposites in diverse ways.\n\nThree of the most prominent structural anthropologists are Lévi-Strauss himself and the British neo-structuralists Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach. The latter was the author of such essays as \"Time and False Noses\" (in \"Rethinking Anthropology\").\n\nLévi-Strauss took many ideas from structural linguistics, including those of Ferdinand de Saussure, Roman Jakobson, Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss. Saussure argued that linguists needed to move beyond the recording of \"parole\" (individual speech acts) and come to an understanding of \"langue\", the grammar of each language.\n\nLévi-Strauss applied this distinction in his search for mental structures that underlie all acts of human behavior: Just as speakers can talk without awareness of grammar, he argued, humans are unaware of the workings of social structures in daily life. The structures that form the \"deep grammar\" of society originate in the mind and operate unconsciously (albeit not in a Freudian sense).\n\nAnother concept was borrowed from the Prague school of linguistics, which employed so-called binary oppositions in their research. Roman Jakobson and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features, such as \"voiceless\" vs. \"voiced\". Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the mind's universal structures. For him, opposites formed the basis of social structure and culture.\n\nIn his early work Lévi-Strauss argued that tribal kinship groups were usually found in pairs, or in paired groups that oppose each other yet need one another. For example, in the Amazon basin, two extended families would build their houses in two facing semicircles that together form a big circle. He showed too that the ways people initially categorized animals, trees, and other natural features, were based on a series of oppositions.\n\nIn his most popular work, \"The Raw and the Cooked\", he described folk tales of tribal South America as related to one another through a series of transformations—as one opposite in tales \"here\" changed into its opposite in tales \"there.\" For example, as the title implies, raw becomes its opposite cooked. These particular opposites (raw/cooked) are symbolic of human culture itself, in which by means of thought and labour (economics), raw materials become clothes, food, weapons, art and ideas.\n\nWhile Durkheim thought that taxonomies of the natural world are collective in origin (the \"collective conscious\"), meaning that social structures influence individual cognitive structures, Lévi-Strauss proposed the opposite, arguing that it is the latter that gives rise to the former. Social structures mirror cognitive structures, meaning that patterns in social interaction can be treated as their manifestations. While structural-functionalists looked for structures within social organisation, structuralism seeks to identify links between structures of thought and social structures. Possibly the most significant influence on structuralism came from Mauss' \"The Gift\". Mauss argued that gifts are not free, but rather oblige the recipient to reciprocate. Through the gift, the givers give part of themselves, imbuing the gift a certain power that compels a response. Gift exchanges, therefore play a crucial role in creating and maintaining social relationships by establishing bonds of obligations. Gifts are not merely physical, incidental objects; they possess cultural and spiritual properties. It is a \"total prestation\" as Mauss called it, as it carries the power to create a system of reciprocity in which the honour of both giver and recipient are engaged. Social relationships are therefore based on exchange; Durkheimian solidarity, according to Mauss, is best achieved through structures of reciprocity and related systems of exchange.\n\nLévi-Strauss took this idea and postulated three fundamental properties of the human mind: a) people follow rules; b) reciprocity is the simplest way to create social relationships; c) a gift binds both giver and recipient in a continuing social relationship\n\nStructures are universal; their realization is culturally specific. Lévi-Strauss argued that exchange is the universal basis of kinship systems, the structures of which depend on the type of marriage rules that apply. Because of its strong focus on vertical social relations, Lévi-Strauss' model of kinship systems came to be called alliance theory.\n\nLévi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for cross-cousin marriage, sister-exchange, dual organization and rules of exogamy. Over time, marriage rules create social structures because marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between spouses. When groups exchange women on a regular basis, they marry together; consequently, each marriage creates a debtor/creditor relationship that must be balanced through the \"repayment\" of wives, either immediately or in the next generation.\n\nLévi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the incest taboo. He deemed this the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first prohibition to check natural impulses; secondarily, it divides labor by gender. Prescribing exogamy creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women that necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group (\"marry out or die out\") and fosters exchange relationships with other groups. Exogamy promotes inter-group alliances and forms structures of social networks.\n\nLévi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex—from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.\n\nElementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.\n\nThe second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD (matrilateral cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD (patrilateral cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the Kachin). Lévi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups. Examples of restricted exchange are found, for instance, in the Amazon basin. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties that often split up, rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, as e.g. amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin, also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.\n\nFrom a structural perspective matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Lévi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk as group A depends on receiving a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, producing a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.\n\nLévi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called semi-complex structure or Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively prescribe marriage to specific parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found, for example, among the Crow Nation and Omaha Native Americans in the United States.\n\nIn Lévi-Strauss' view, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This \"mother's brother\" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such, but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two sides of one coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).\n\nMuch earlier, and some 450 miles north of Paris, a specific type of applied anthropology emerged at Leiden University, Netherlands that focused frequently on the relationship between apparent cultural phenomena found in the Indonesian archipelago: Batak, Minangkabau, Moluccas, etc., though it was primarily aimed at training governors for colonial Indonesia. This type of anthropology, developed by late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century scholars, was eventually called \"de Leidse Richting,\" or \"de Leidse School,\".\n\nMultiple researchers were educated in this school. This theory attracted students and researchers interested in a holistic approach, that was broad and deep, that related economic circumstances with mythological and spatial classifications and that explored the relationship between the natural world and religious, symbolic systems. This was long before structuralism. The \"Leiden\" perspective drove research for many decades, influencing successive generations of anthropologists.\n\nThe most recent chairs were held by J. P. B. de Josselin de Jong (chair: 1922–1956, 1964), who coined the concept of the Field of Ethnological Study in 1935, and later his nephew P. E. de Josselin de Jong (chair: 1956–1987, 1999).\n\nThe British brand of structuralism was mainly espoused by Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach, who were both critical towards the structural-functionalist perspective and who drew on Lévi-Strauss as well as Arthur Maurice Hocart. They also found grounds for critiquing Lévi-Strauss. Leach was more concerned with researching people's actual lives than with the discovery of universal mental structures.\n\nHe found that the latter's analysis of the Kachin contained serious flaws. According to Leach, Lévi-Strauss' project had been overly ambitious, meaning that his analyses were too superficial and the available data treated with too little care. While part of his analysis of the Kachin was simply based on incorrect ethnographic information, the rest reflected Kachin ideology but not actual practice.\n\nIn theory, Kachin groups were supposed to marry in a circle ideally consisting of five groups. In reality, the system was strongly unbalanced with built-in status differences between wife-givers and wife-takers. Lévi-Strauss had incorrectly assumed that wife-takers would be of higher rank than wife-givers; in reality, it was the other way round, and the former usually had to make substantial bridewealth payments to obtain wives. Overall, some lineages would accumulate more wives and material wealth than others, meaning that the system was not driven primarily by reciprocity. The marriage system was quite messy and the chance of it breaking down increased with the number of groups involved.\n\nIn generalised exchange systems, more groups imply greater complexity to ensure that all wife-givers will eventually be on the receiving end, an issue that Lévi-Strauss had already foreseen. He thought that in practice there would be competition for women, leading to accumulation and therefore asymmetries in the system. According to Leach, in Kachin reality instabilities arose primarily from competition for bridewealth. Men sought to get the maximum profit in forms of either bridewealth or political advantage from their daughters' marriage. Lévi-Strauss had only accorded a symbolic role to marriage prestations, effectively overlooking their significance within the system. Leach argued that they are also (or even primarily) economic and political transactions and are frequently connected to transfers of rights over land, too.\n\nMarriage exchanges need to be analysed within their wider economic and political context rather than in isolation, as Lévi-Strauss attempted. Leach charged the latter with neglecting the effects of material conditions on social relations. He also challenged the claims to universality made by Lévi-Strauss about the model, doubting whether structures generated by marriage rules would be the same in different social contexts.\n\nBy the late 1970s/early 1980s, alliance theory had lost influence. With the advent of postmodern, interpretive-hermeneutic thought, structuralist and functionalist theories receded. Internal incoherence and a range of intrinsic limitations further reduced its appeal.\n\nBy overstressing the structural significance of affinal ties, alliance theory effectively neglected the importance of descent and genealogical ties. Some societies (e.g. African tribal societies) employ descent as their primary organizational principle. In others, alliances are of primary significance, as in e.g. many Southeast-Asian societies and amongst Amazon tribes; and still others emphasise both. The Yanomami fit very well into the alliance theory mold, while the Tallensi or Azande do not. Holý (1996) pointed out that some Middle-Eastern societies cannot be conclusively explained by either descent or alliance theory.\n\nCritics also saw weaknesses in Lévi-Strauss' methods, in the fact that he looked for ideal structures, thereby neglecting the reality and complexity of actual practices. His model explained practices that were not observed. Kuper pointed out that if the structures of the mind really are universal and Lévi-Strauss' model is correct, then why do not all human societies act accordingly and structure their kinship systems around alliances and exchanges? Kuper allowed that exchange was the universal form of marriage, but there could be other significant factors. And even if reciprocity was the primary principle that underlies marriages, the return would not have to be in kind but could take other forms (such as money, livestock, services or favours of various kinds). Also, social cohesion through reciprocity does not have to rest primarily on the bride exchange. Mauss showed that different cultures use all kinds of gifts to create and maintain alliances.\n\nFeminists critique Lévi-Strauss' claim that the underlying principle according to which all societies work is the exchange of women by men, who dispose of them as if they were objects. Others, for example Godelier, critiqued structuralism's synchronic approach that led it to be essentially ahistorical.\n\nMarxists shifted the attention within anthropology from an almost exclusive preoccupation with kinship to an emphasis on economic issues. For them, social structures were primarily shaped by material conditions, property relations and class struggles.\n\nStructuralism's main propositions were not formulated in a way so that they could be subject to verification or falsification. Lévi-Strauss did not develop a framework that could prove the existence of his concept of the fundamental structures of human thought, but simply assumed their existence. Boyer pointed out that experimental research on concepts in psychology have not supported a structuralistic view of concepts, but rather a theory-oriented or prototype-based view.\n\n\n\n"}

It was expected to reopen in summer 2020 as a distillery with a gift shop and pub under a new leaseholder.\n\nSituated on the eastern fringes of Cheshire in the Peak District National Park on the A537 road just west of the Derbyshire/Cheshire county boundary, on the western side of Axe Edge Moor. It is at an elevation of 1,689 feet (515 m) above sea level (although a measurement commissioned by a former landlord suggested a figure of 1,772 feet (540 m), which would surpass that of the Tan Hill Inn). The Ordnance Survey have fixed an accurately measured flush-bracket benchmark to the front wall of the pub. The height of this flush bracket is 515.1984 metres (1,690 ft 3.40 in), and the flush bracket is 0.4 metres (16 in) above the ground level, which casts doubt over the validity of the private survey.\n\nThe inn is on the eastern fringes of Cheshire in the Peak District National Park, on the A537 road just west of the Derbyshire–Cheshire county boundary and Axe Edge Moor, at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey have fixed an accurately measured flush-bracket benchmark to the front wall of the pub. The height of this flush bracket is and the flush bracket is above the ground level.\n\nThe inn is the last on the Four Inns Walk, held annually in spring, mainly over the high moorland to the north.\n\nThe pub was built in 1813. It closed in December 2015, and in November 2017, its future as a public house was uncertain; owners Robinsons Brewery said in 2016 that it was \"closed until further notice\". In September 2016, a local newspaper reported it would reopen, but no date was subsequently announced.\n\nOn 21 October 2019 Robinsons announced that a \"long-term lease\" had been taken out on the building by Forest Distillery, who intended to re-open the site in summer 2020 as a destination attraction featuring a distillery, shop and pub. Distillery owner Karl Bond said he bought the pub to store barrels of whisky, according to a BBC article; other reports confirmed that Bond was leasing the property, with ownership retained by Robinson's Brewery. Bond planned to complete extensive renovations and reopen the inn as a pub and distillery in 2020. Crowd funding provided over £50,000 of a sum estimated at over £250,000 for the restoration. Bond said: \"it needs a full new environmentally-friendly sewage system and that’s just to get the toilets to flush – it needs a new roof, new floor, new ceiling, new lighting...\" In December 2019 it was reported the pub would be renamed The Cat, Fiddle and Weasel because of Forest Distillery's weasel logo. Bond said: \"We want to have Britain's highest whisky distillery ... but also turn one section into a shop, where you can pick up beer and wines and deli products, or ... you can get a coffee and a pastry\".\n\nThe inn gives its name to the Cat and Fiddle Road: a stretch of the A537 road, linking Macclesfield to the west with Buxton to the east, which features many sharp corners. This road became notorious for the high number of accidents, particularly among motorcyclists for whom the road is often regarded as an exhilarating technical challenge; an AA survey in 2003 named it as the most dangerous stretch of road in the United Kingdom.\n\nA 2016 report indicates that between 2007 and 2011, there were 44 serious or fatal crashes on the stretch. Between 2002 and 2006, there were 35. The report states that the safety issue is caused by \"severe bends, steep falls from the carriageway and edged by dry-stone walls for almost the entirety of the road\". Derby and Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership and the Department for Transport arranged for the installation of front- and rear-facing speed cameras in the area. These were confirmed to be in place in December 2019.\n\nThere are several pubs of this name in the United Kingdom. For example, there is a Cat and Fiddle pub in Hinton, Hampshire, currently owned by Harvester.\n\nVarious etymologies are claimed: some believe it is a corruption of \"le chat fidèle\" ('the faithful cat'); others (including Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable) that it comes from Caton le Fidèle (a former governor of Calais); a third theory is that it derives from Catherine la Fidèle (Catherine of Aragon).\n"}

The team was established by Thomas T. Wilson, in Nashville, Tennessee as the semi-pro Nashville Standard Giants on March 26, 1920. The team was renamed the Elite Giants in , and moved to Baltimore, Maryland in , where the team remained for the duration of their existence. The team and its fans pronounced the word \"Elite\" as \"ee-light\".\n\nThe Nashville Standard Giants were formed as a semi-professional all-Negro team in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 26, 1920. The club was chartered by Thomas T. Wilson, T. Clay Moore, J. B. Boyd, Marshall Garrett, Walter Phillips, W. H. Pettis, J. L. Overton, and R. H. Tabor. The team's origins lie in that of two of Nashville's local negro amateur baseball teams: the Nashville Maroons (formed in 1909) and the Elites (formed in 1913). Their home games were played at Sulphur Dell and Greenwood Park, the African American community's local park. The Standard Giants welcomed any and all competition, including white-only teams, but played independently of any organized leagues until the mid-1920s.\n\nThe team was renamed the Nashville Elite Giants (pronounced \"EE-light\") in 1921. That same year, they swept the Montgomery Grey Sox (of the minor league Negro Southern League) in a four-game championship series to win the right to declare themselves the Southern Colored Champions.They continued to play independently until joining the Negro Southern League in 1926. Nashville completed its first season in the league with a 15–15 (.500) record.\n\nIn 1929, Nashville was granted an associate membership in the Negro National League. The team finished in eighth (last) place with a 10–20 (.333) record. That same year, Wilson built a new ballpark for his team, Tom Wilson Park, which also served as a spring training site for other Negro league teams, as well as white-only minor league teams, such as the Southern Association's Nashville Vols. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Roy Campanella are known to have played at the park. The 8,000 (or 4,000) seat facility featured a single-decked, covered grandstand. The ballpark was centrally located in Nashville's largest black community, known as Trimble Bottom, near the convergence of Second and Forth Avenues, just north of the fairgrounds.\n\nIn , the team gained admission into their first organized league, the Negro National League. The Elite Giants finished in seventh place with a 39-47 record. \n\nThe following season, , Wilson moved the team to Cleveland, Ohio and renamed the team the Cleveland Cubs, remaining in the same league. The team finished in seventh place with a 25-28 record.\n\nThe Negro National League collapsed after the 1931 season, and the team moved back to Nashville, reverted to being called the Elite Giants, and joined the Negro Southern League, where they played in .\n\nA second incarnation of the Negro National League was formed in , where the Elite Giants played for the following two seasons. Nashville finished the 1933 season in fifth place with a 29-22 record and tied as winners of the second half of the season with the Pittsburgh Crawfords. Nashville lost a three-game playoff with Pittsburgh for a spot in the league championship game. In , the Elite Giants finished in fourth place with a 20-28 record.\n\nIn , the team moved to Columbus, Ohio and became the Columbus Elite Giants. They played only one season in Columbus, 1935, finishing in fourth place with a 16-17 record. \n\nIn the team moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Elite Giants. In their first season, they finished in fifth place with a 21-24 record. In , the Elites finished in third place with a 27-17 record.\n\nThe team moved again in to Baltimore, Maryland and became the Baltimore Elite Giants. In , the Elites won the Negro National Title, defeating the Homestead Grays. In , they won the first half, but lost the championship to second half winners, the Homestead Grays.\n\nIn , the Negro National League ceased operations, and the Elite Giants joined the Negro American League. In their first season with the new league, Baltimore captured the Eastern and Western Division titles, earning them a second Negro National Title. In thirteen seasons in Baltimore, of the eleven which have available standings, the Elite Giants finished in the top three during nine of those seasons. In dire financial straits, the club played one final season in before dissolving.\n\nA number of future major leaguers wore the uniform of the Elite Giants, including Hall of Famers Roy Campanella and Leon Day. Junior Gilliam (1953 National League Rookie of the Year), and Joe Black (1952 National League Rookie of the Year) were both former 'Elites' and won consecutive Rookie of the Year honors for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1950s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1943799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943799", "title": "Bataireacht", "text": "Bataireacht\n\nIn Irish martial arts, bataireacht (, meaning \"stick-fighting\") or boiscín are the various forms of stick-fighting from Ireland.\n\n\"Bataireacht\" is a category of stick-fighting martial arts of Ireland. \n\n\"Bata\" is the Irish term for any kind of stick. In stickfighting, the actual \"bata\" or stick used for \"bataireacht\" is a \"Sail Éille\" (anglicised as \"shillelagh\") or, in earlier texts, a \"cudgel\". Blackthorn, oak, ash and hazel were traditionally the most common types of woods used to make shillelagh fighting sticks. Some authors have argued that prior to the 19th century, the term had been used to refer to a form of stick-fencing used to train Irish soldiers in broadsword and sabre techniques.\nUpon further observations it appears that the art might have been developed by the working class more or less independently as no technical source seem to hint at a sword fencing origin.\n\nThe style is mostly characterized by the use of a cudgel, a knobbed stick, of different lengths but most often the size of a walking stick or small club. The stick is grabbed by the third, the lower part protecting the elbow and allowing the user to maintain an offensive as well as defensive guard. This grip also allows launching fast punching-like strikes.\n\nThe Irish have used various sticks and cudgels as weapons of self-defence for centuries. As with most vernacular martial arts, it is difficult to establish the origin of the art. Weapons similar to shillelagh are described in various sources including heroic tales such as The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel. It would truly begin to catch the attention of writers in the 18th century. The shillelagh is still identified with Irish popular culture to this day, although the arts of bataireacht are much less so. The sticks used for bataireacht are not of a standardised size, as there are various styles of bataireacht, using various kinds of sticks.\n\nBy the 18th century bataireacht became increasingly associated with Irish gangs called \"factions\". Irish faction fights involved large groups of men (and sometimes women) who engaged in melees at county fairs, weddings, funerals, or any other convenient gathering. Historians such as Carolyn Conley, believe that this reflected a culture of recreational violence. It is also argued that faction fighting had class and political overtones, as depicted for example in the works of William Carleton and James S. Donnelly, Jr.'s \"Irish Peasants: Violence & Political Unrest, 1780\".\n\nBy the early 19th century, these gangs had organised into larger regional federations, which coalesced from the old Whiteboys, into the Caravat and Shanavest factions. Beginning in Munster the \"Caravat and Shanavest\" \"war\" erupted sporadically throughout the 19th century and caused some serious disturbances.\n\nAs the faction fights became increasingly repressed and other sports such as hurling were promoted, bataireacht slowly faded away by the turn of the 20th century. Although still documented sporadically, it has become mostly an underground practice saved by a few families who still handed down their own styles.\n\nThe modern practice of \"bataireacht\" has arisen amongst some practitioners from a desire to maintain or reinstate Irish family traditions, while for others a combination of historical and cultural interest has led to their interest. Bataireacht has also gained popularity amongst non-Irish people, especially in North America, as a form of self-defence, as a cane or walking stick can be easily carried in modern society.\n\nA few forms of \"bataireacht\" survive to this day, some of which are traditional styles specific to the family which carried them down through the years, like the \"rince an bhata uisce bheatha\" ('dance [of] the whiskey stick') style of the Doyle family of Newfoundland, taught in Canada, the United States and Germany, or the Antrim stick which is taught in Canada, the United States, Ireland, Mexico and France.\n\nAdditionally, members of the Western martial arts movement have \"reconstructed\" styles using period martial arts manuals, historical newspaper articles, magazines, pictorial evidence and court documents. Surviving instructional manuals which describe some use of the shillelagh include those by Rowland Allanson-Winn and Donald Walker.\n"}
{"id": "1943811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943811", "title": "Intersubjectivity", "text": "Intersubjectivity\n\nIntersubjectivity, in philosophy, psychology, sociology, and anthropology, is the psychological relation between people. It is usually used in contrast to solipsistic individual experience, emphasizing the inherent sociality of humans.\n\n\"Intersubjectivity\" is a term coined by social scientists as a short-hand description for a variety of human interactions. For example, social psychologists Alex Gillespie and Flora Cornish list at least six definitions of intersubjectivity (and other disciplines have additional definitions).\n\n\"Intersubjectivity\" has been used in social science to refer to agreement. There is \"intersubjectivity\" between people if they agree on a given set of meanings or a definition of the situation. Similarly, Thomas Scheff defines \"intersubjectivity\" as \"the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals.\"\n\n\"Intersubjectivity\" also has been used to refer to the common-sense, shared meanings constructed by people in their interactions with each other and used as an everyday resource to interpret the meaning of elements of social and cultural life. If people share common sense, then they share a definition of the situation.\n\nThe term has also been used to refer to shared (or partially shared) \"divergences\" of meaning. Self-presentation, lying, practical jokes, and social emotions, for example, all entail not a shared definition of the situation but partially shared divergences of meaning. Someone who is telling a lie is engaged in an intersubjective act because they are working with two different definitions of the situation. Lying is thus genuinely \"inter\"subjective (in the sense of operating between two subjective definitions of reality).\n\n\"Intersubjectivity\" can also be understood as the process of so-called psychological energy moving between two or more subjects. In a room where someone is lying on their deathbed, for example, the room can appear enveloped in a shroud of gloom for people interacting with the dying person. The psychological weight of one subject comes to bear on the minds of others depending on how they react to it, thereby creating an intersubjective experience that, without multiple consciousnesses interacting with each other, would be otherwise strictly solitary. Love is a prime example of intersubjectivity that implies a shared feeling of care and affection, among others.\n\nAmong the early authors who explored this conception in psychoanalysis, in an explicit or implicit way, were Heinz Kohut, Robert Stolorow, George E. Atwood, Jessica Benjamin in the United States, and in Italy.\n\nPsychoanalyst Jessica Benjamin, in \"The Bonds of Love\", writes, \"The concept of intersubjectivity has its origins in the social theory of Jürgen Habermas (1970), who used the expression 'the intersubjectivity of mutual understanding' to designate an individual capacity and a social domain.\"\n\nContemporarily, intersubjectivity is a major topic in both the analytic and the continental traditions of philosophy. Intersubjectivity is considered crucial not only at the relational level but also at the epistemological and even metaphysical levels. For example, intersubjectivity is postulated as playing a role in establishing the truth of propositions, and constituting the so-called objectivity of objects.\n\nA central concern in consciousness studies of the past 50 years is the so-called problem of \"other minds,\" which asks how we can justify our belief that people have minds much like our own and predict others' mind-states and behavior, as our experience shows we often can. Contemporary philosophical theories of intersubjectivity need to address the problem of other minds.\n\nIn the debate between cognitive individualism and cognitive universalism, some aspects of thinking are neither solely personal nor fully universal. Cognitive sociology proponents argue for \"intersubjectivity\"—an intermediate perspective of social cognition that provides a balanced view between personal and universal views of our social cognition. This approach suggests that, instead of being individual or universal thinkers, human beings subscribe to \"thought communities\"—communities of differing beliefs. Thought community examples include churches, professions, scientific beliefs, generations, nations, and political movements. This perspective explains why each individual thinks differently from another (individualism): person A may choose to adhere to expiry dates on foods, but person B may believe that expiry dates are only guidelines and it is still safe to eat the food days past the expiry date. But not all human beings think the same way (universalism).\n\nIntersubjectivity argues that each thought community shares social experiences that are different from the social experiences of other thought communities, creating differing beliefs among people who subscribe to different thought communities. These experiences transcend our subjectivity, which explains why they can be shared by the entire thought community. Proponents of intersubjectivity support the view that individual beliefs are often the result of thought community beliefs, not just personal experiences or universal and objective human beliefs. Beliefs are recast in terms of standards, which are set by thought communities.\n\nEdmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, recognized the importance of intersubjectivity, and wrote extensively on the topic. In German, his writings on intersubjectivity are gathered in volumes 13–15 of the \"Husserliana\". In English, his best-known text on intersubjectivity is the \"Cartesian Meditations\" (it is this text that features solely in the Husserl reader entitled \"The Essential Husserl\"). Although Husserlian phenomenology is often charged with methodological solipsism, in the fifth Cartesian Meditation, Husserl attempts to grapple with the problem of intersubjectivity and puts forward his theory of transcendental, monadological intersubjectivity.\n\nHusserl's student Edith Stein extended intersubjectivity's basis in empathy in her 1917 doctoral dissertation, \"On the Problem of Empathy\" (\"Zum Problem der Einfühlung\").\n\nIntersubjectivity also helps to constitute objectivity: in the experience of the world as available not only to oneself, but also to the Other, there is a bridge between the personal and the shared, the self and the Others.\n\nDiscussions and theories of intersubjectivity are prominent and of importance in contemporary psychology, theory of mind, and consciousness studies. Three major contemporary theories of intersubjectivity are theory theory, simulation theory, and interaction theory.\n\nShannon Spaulding, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Oklahoma State University, writes; \"Theory theorists argue that we explain and predict behaviour by employing folk psychological theories about how mental states inform behaviour. With our folk psychological theories, we infer from a target's behaviour what his or her mental states probably are. And from these inferences, plus the psychological principles in the theory connecting mental states to behavior, we predict the target's behaviour (Carruthers and Smith 1996; Davies and Stone 1995a; Gopnik and Wellman 1992; Nichols and Stich 2003).\"\n\nSimulation theorists, on the other hand, claim that we explain and predict others' behaviour by using our own minds as a model and \"putting ourselves in another's shoes\"—that is, by imagining what our mental states would be and how we would behave if we were in the other's situation. More specifically, we simulate what the other's mental states could have been to cause the observed behaviour, then use the simulated mental states, pretend beliefs, and pretend desires as input, running them through our own decision-making mechanism. We then take the resulting conclusion and attribute it to the other person. Recently, authors like Vittorio Gallese have proposed a theory of embodied simulation that refers to neuroscientific research on mirror neurons and phenomenological research.\n\nSpaulding notes that this debate has stalled in the past few years, with progress limited to articulating various hybrid simulation theories—\"theory theory\" accounts. To resolve this impasse, authors like Shaun Gallagher put forward interaction theory. Gallagher writes that an \"...important shift is taking place in social cognition research, away from a focus on the individual mind and toward... participatory aspects of social understanding...\" Interaction theory is put forward to \"galvanize\" the interactive turn in explanations of intersubjectivity. Gallagher defines an interaction as two or more autonomous agents engaged in co-regulated coupling behavior. For example, when walking a dog, both the owner's behavior is regulated by the dog stopping and sniffing, and the dog's behavior is regulated by the lead and the owner's commands. Ergo, walking the dog is an example of an interactive process. For Gallagher, interaction and direct perception constitute what he terms \"primary\" (or basic) intersubjectivity.\n\nStudies of dialogue and dialogism reveal how language is deeply intersubjective. When we speak, we always address our interlocutors, taking their perspective and orienting to what we think they think (or, more often, don't think). Within this tradition of research, it has been argued that the structure of individual signs or symbols, the basis of language, is intersubjective and that the psychological process of self-reflection entails intersubjectivity. Recent research on mirror neurons provides evidence for the deeply intersubjective basis of human psychology, and arguably much of the literature on empathy and theory of mind relates directly to intersubjectivity.\n\nColwyn Trevarthen has applied intersubjectivity to the very rapid cultural development of new born infants. Research suggests that as babies, humans are biologically wired to “coordinate their actions with others.” This ability to coordinate and sync with others facilitates cognitive and emotional learning through social interaction. Additionally, the most socially productive relationship between children and adults is bidirectional, where both parties actively define a shared culture. The bidirectional aspect lets the active parties organize the relationship how they see fit—what they see as important receives the most focus. Emphasis is placed on the idea that children are actively involved in how they learn, using intersubjectivity.\n\nThe ways intersubjectivity occurs varies across cultures. In certain Indigenous American communities, nonverbal communication is so prevalent that intersubjectivity may occur regularly amongst all members of the community, in part perhaps due to a \"joint cultural understanding\" and a history of shared endeavors. This \"joint cultural understanding\" may develop in small, Indigenous American communities where children have grown up embedded in their community's values, expectations, and livelihoods—learning through participation with adults rather than through intent verbal instruction—working in cohesion with one another in shared endeavors on a daily basis. Having grown up within this context may have led to members of this community to have what is described by some as a \"blending of agendas,\" or by others as a \"dovetailing of motives.\" If community or family members have the same general goals in mind they may thus act cohesively within an overlapping state of mind. Whether persons are in each other's presence or merely within the same community this blending of agendas or dovetailing of motives enables intersubjectivity to occur within these shared endeavors.\n\nThe cultural value of \"respeto\" may also contribute to intersubjectivity in some communities; unlike the English definition of 'respect,' \"respeto\" refers loosely to a mutual consideration for others' activities, needs, wants, etc. Similar to \"putting yourself in one's shoes\" the prevalence of \"respeto\" in certain Indigenous American communities in Mexico and South America may promote intersubjectivity as persons act in accordance with one another within consideration for the community or the individual's current needs or state of mind.\n\nShared reference during an activity facilitates learning. Adults either teach by doing the task with children, or by directing attention toward experts. Children that had to ask questions in regard to how to perform a task were scolded for not learning by another's example, as though they were ignoring the available resources to learn a task, as seen in Tz’utujil Maya parents who scolded questioning children and asking \"if they had eyes.\"\n\nChildren from the Chillihuani village in the Andean mountains learned to weave without explicit instruction. They learned the basic technique from others by observing, eager to participate in their community. The learning process was facilitated by watching adults and by being allowed to play and experiment using tools to create their own weaving techniques.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1943819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943819", "title": "Doctor Who theme music", "text": "Doctor Who theme music\n\nThe \"Doctor Who\" theme music is a piece of music written by Australian composer Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Created in 1963, it was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television. It is used as the theme for the science fiction program \"Doctor Who\", and has been adapted and covered many times.\n\nAlthough numerous arrangements of the theme have been used on television, the main melody has remained the same. The theme was originally written and arranged in the key of E minor. Most versions of the theme - including the current arrangement by Segun Akinola - have retained the use of the original key, with exceptions being Peter Howell (F# minor) and Keff McCulloch's (A minor) arrangements.\n\nAlthough widely listed in reference works, and many series soundtrack albums, under the title \"Doctor Who Theme\", its official title is \"Doctor Who\", although its initial sheet music release used the now-deprecated form \"Dr. Who\".\n\nThe original 1963 recording of the \"Doctor Who\" theme music is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers. Delia Derbyshire (assisted by Dick Mills) of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop used musique concrète techniques to realise a score written by composer Ron Grainer. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators which were used for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music.\nThe main, pulsing bassline rhythm was created from a recording of a single plucked string, played over and over again in different patterns created by splicing copies of the sound, with different pitches and notes achieved by playing the sample in different speeds. The swooping melody and lower bassline layer were created by manually adjusting the pitch of oscillator banks to a carefully timed pattern. The non-swooping parts of the melody were created by playing a keyboard attached to the oscillator banks. The rhythmic hissing sounds, \"bubbles\" and \"clouds\", were created by cutting tape recordings of filtered white noise.\n\nOnce each sound had been created, it was modified. Some sounds were created at all the required pitches direct from the oscillators, others had to be repitched later by adjusting the tape playback speed and re-recording the sound onto another tape player. This process continued until every sound was available at all the required pitches. To create dynamics, the notes were re-recorded at slightly different levels.\n\nEach individual note was then trimmed to length by cutting the tape, and stuck together in the right order. This was done for each \"line\" in the music – the main plucked bass, the bass slides (an organ-like tone emphasising the grace notes), the hisses, the swoops, the melody, a second melody line (a high organ-like tone used for emphasis), and the bubbles and clouds. Most of these individual bits of tape making up lines of music, complete with edits every inch, still survive.\n\nThis done, the music had to be \"mixed\". There were no multitrack tape machines, so rudimentary multitrack techniques were invented: each length of tape was placed on a separate tape machine and all the machines were started simultaneously and the outputs mixed together. If the machines didn't stay in sync, they started again, maybe cutting tapes slightly here and there to help. In fact, a number of \"submixes\" were made to ease the process – a combined bass track, combined melody track, bubble track, and hisses.\n\nGrainer was amazed at the resulting piece of music and when he heard it, famously asked, \"Did I write that?\" Derbyshire modestly replied, \"Most of it.\" However the BBC, who wanted to keep members of the Workshop anonymous, prevented Grainer from getting Derbyshire a co-composer credit and a share of the royalties.\n\nThe theme can be divided into several distinctive parts. A rhythmic bassline opens and underlies the theme throughout, followed by a rising and falling set of notes that forms the main melody which is repeated several times. The bridge, also known as the \"middle eight\", is an uplifting interlude in a major key that usually features in the closing credits or the full version of the theme. During the early years of the series the middle eight was also often heard during the opening credits (most notably in the first episode, \"An Unearthly Child\").\n\nThe theme is written in the E minor phrygian mode.\n\nThe theme has been often called both memorable and frightening, priming the viewer for what was to follow. During the 1970s, the \"Radio Times\", the BBC's own listings magazine, announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The \"Radio Times\" was apologetic, but the theme music remained.\n\nDerbyshire created two arrangements in 1963: the first was rejected by the producers, but was released as a single. The second arrangement, a slightly modified version of the first, was used on the first episode of the programme. The two 1963 arrangements served, with only minor edits and additions requested by the producers, as the theme tune up to 1980 and the end of Season 17. The most notable of these edits were addition of 'electronic spangles', and tape echo, from the Patrick Troughton serial \"The Faceless Ones\" onwards (although it was originally made for \"The Macra Terror\", a production error led to the previous arrangement still being used) and the addition of a \"sting\" at the start of the closing credits during Jon Pertwee's first season.\n\nIn 2002, Mark Ayres used Derbyshire's original masters to mix full stereo and surround sound versions of the theme. Ayres revised the mix in 2006, for the \"Doctor Who\" DVD box set \"The Beginning\", as the 2002 mix contained an editing error in the bassline.\n\nDuring the Third Doctor's era, beginning in 1970, the theme tune was altered. The theme was edited to match the new credit sequence, with an added stutter/pre-echo to the bassline at the start of the theme, a shortened introduction and part of the main motif repeated to fade at the end of the titles. The \"middle eight\" was no longer used in the opening sequence. Over the closing credits, parts of the tune were duplicated as required for the theme to end with the credits, rather than fading out as it had previously. The \"sting\", an electronic shriek, was added to punctuate the episode cliffhangers and serve as a lead-in to the closing theme from \"The Ambassadors of Death\" (1970) onwards, with the \"middle eight\" also falling out of use in the closing credits from this serial. The first three serials of Season 8 reverted to the 1967 arrangement before reinstating the Third Doctor's arrangement for the last two serials of that year. During the Fourth Doctor era, the \"middle eight\" was heard on only four episodes during his first six seasons – \"The Invasion of Time\" parts 3,4 & 6 and \"The Armageddon Factor\" part 6. The adoption of Peter Howell's arrangement in 1980 re-instated the section.\n\nIn 1972, there was an attempt by Brian Hodgson and Paddy Kingsland, with Delia Derbyshire acting as producer, to modernise the theme tune using the Radiophonic Workshop's modular \"Delaware\" synthesiser (named after the Workshop's location at Delaware Road). The \"Delaware\" arrangement, which had a distinct Jew's harp sound, was not well received by BBC executives and was abandoned. The master tapes were given to a fan at the 1983 Longleat celebrations by Hodgson and were never returned. The episodes that used it were redubbed with the 1970 Derbyshire arrangement, but lacking the short bassline stutter at the beginning of the music. The Delaware version was accidentally left on some episodes which were sold to Australia, and survives today in this form. (The complete version of this arrangement of the music is included as an extra on the DVD release of \"Carnival of Monsters\"; it is also included on the CD release \"Doctor Who at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop: Volume 2: New Beginnings 1970–1980\".)\n\nThe first single arising from the show to make the UK Singles Chart was \"Dr. Who\" by Mankind. The track was based on the theme music and was Mankind's first and only hit single. Released by Pinnacle on 25 November 1978, the song peaked at Number 25 in the UK Singles Chart and ran for 12 weeks in the BBC Top 75.\n\nFor Season 18, Radiophonic Workshop staffer Peter Howell provided a new arrangement performed on analog synthesisers, and having more dynamic and glossy, but less haunting feel. Its bassline was created on a Yamaha CS-80 synthesiser, with reversed echo added, adding to its characteristic \"zshumm\" sound and emphasizing especially the bass slides (which are otherwise still more upfront than in the Derbyshire theme). The sting at the beginning was also created with the CS-80, using its unique ring modulator section. The opening line of the main melody was played on an ARP Odyssey Mk III, the second on an EMS Vocoder 5000, and the \"middle eight\" on a Roland Jupiter-4. The 1980 arrangement added the sting to the opening theme as well, while the \"middle eight\" was included in the closing theme arrangement of all episodes. Howell's theme is in the key of F♯ minor.\n\nThe Howell theme was eventually replaced by a new arrangement by Dominic Glynn for Season 23's \"The Trial of a Time Lord\" (1986). This version — again synthesizer-driven, like the Howell arrangement, only this time using digital synthesizers — was made to sound more mysterious than previous renditions but was only used for this single season of the series. Glynn's theme reverts to the traditional key of E minor, even though it is slightly detuned in some episodes (perhaps as a result of a mistake in the dubbing stage). The bassline was performed on a Roland Juno-6 synthesiser, while the melody and filtered noise effects were performed on a Yamaha DX21 and Korg 770 respectively. The theme removes the bass slides which were featured in all previous official arrangements, and is instead merged into the main bassline.\n\nThe Glynn arrangement was itself replaced by a new arrangement by Keff McCulloch for the Seventh Doctor's era beginning with Season 24 (1987). McCulloch's arrangement was made using a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesiser, with the initial 'sting' replaced by a crashing explosive sound. Producer John Nathan-Turner stated that the new music, logo and title sequence were to signal a fresh start to the programme. This was the first version of the theme since the little-used 1973 Delaware version to incorporate the \"middle eight\" into the opening credits (as well as the closing - Although the closing credits saw them extended slightly). McCulloch's theme is in the key of A minor. Delia Derbyshire was reportedly very unhappy with McCulloch's version.\n\nThe 1996 \"Doctor Who\" television movie used a fully orchestrated version, arranged by John Debney. This contained a new introduction, being a quieter piece of music over which part of the Eighth Doctor's (Paul McGann) opening narration was read, leading into a crescendo into the \"middle eight\", a departure from previous versions of the theme. Debney's version of the theme begins in A minor, but after the middle eight the main melody is transposed back to E minor, as in the original score. Less evident in this version of the score is the rhythmic bassline that opens and underscores all previous (and later) televised versions of the theme; a bassline is present, but it does not rise and fall in the same way. Debney is the only composer that receives screen credit during the movie, with the by-then-deceased Grainer not being credited on screen for composing the theme. Debney at one point was nearly asked to compose a new theme due to licensing issues regarding the Grainer composition.\n\nWhen Big Finish Productions began to produce Eighth Doctor audio plays in 2001 (beginning with \"Storm Warning\"), they approached composer David Arnold, who produced a new arrangement of the \"Doctor Who\" theme for the Eighth Doctor. The Arnold arrangement was used for every Eighth Doctor audio play until 2008's \"Dead London\". They proceeded to use this theme arrangement again from 2012's \"Dark Eyes\" onward.\n\nIn 2005, the television series was revived. Murray Gold's theme arrangement featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added: an orchestral sound of low horns, strings and percussion and part of the Dalek ray-gun and TARDIS materialisation sound effects. Rapidly rising and falling strings is an element that was not present in any prior version of the theme.\n\nThe sting once again served as the lead-in to the theme, but Gold omitted the \"middle eight\" from both the opening and closing credits. Gold has said that his interpretation was driven by the title visual sequence he was given to work around. Gold created a variation on his arrangement for the closing credits of \"The Christmas Invasion\", which was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. Unlike his arrangement for the 2005 series, this version restored the \"middle eight\"; it was also used for the closing credits of the 2006 and 2007 series.\n\nIn November 2007, following the BBC's announcement that it was requiring all series to implement a shorter closing credits sequence, Murray Gold produced a third version featuring additional drums, piano and bass guitar and a variation of \"The Chase\" counter-melody while retaining the original Derbyshire electronic melody line, used from the Christmas 2007 episode. The 2008 series featured a modified arrangement of this version.\n\nIn 2005, a new orchestral arrangement by Christopher Austin was commissioned by the BBC for the \"Blue Peter\" prom and performed by the BBC Philharmonic. It has also been performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra as part of the celebration of 75 years at Maida Vale.\n\nFrom \"The Eleventh Hour\" the theme received a complete reworking to tie in with the new cast, production design and title sequence design. Arranged by Murray Gold, this theme, while still retaining Gold's own \"The Chase\" counter-melody, has the bassline and electronic melody redone by Gold on a synthesizer. The reworking was something of a departure from all previous arrangements, with a prominent new melodic fanfare theme playing in the opening bars, and a percussion sound accenting each quaver of the rhythm. The end credits featured only a short arrangement with introductory fanfare and the final notes of the main theme. The only exception to this was at the end of \"The Beast Below\", where the full theme tune begins under the trailer for \"Victory of the Daleks\". This is the only episode with this arrangement to feature the 'middle eight'.\n\nA leaked playlist for the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony suggested that the theme would be performed, but this did not occur.\n\nThe theme and title sequence was revised yet again the 2012 Christmas Special, \"The Snowmen\" to coincide with a change of companion. This new piece retains the melodic fanfare of the opening bars, as well as Gold's bassline and lead - albeit with all of them modified (with the latter two's timbre modified - especially the bassline, and the lead dipping slightly downwards during the first high B note) and lacking both the heavy use of percussion from the previous arrangement and \"The Chase\" counter-melody that featured in all previous Gold arrangements (as well as, probably, the bass slides). However, for the end credits of this episode, the previous arrangement was still used (this possibly being a production update). This arrangement was revised further for \"The Bells of Saint John\", featuring a more prominent bassline and removing the electronic beeps during the opening fanfare. The end credits were updated to use this version of the theme, now featuring the main melody repeated twice, in place of the fanfare. The ending of the opening theme was altered to incorporate some orchestral elements from the 2010-12 version, along with some other minor changes. The 'sting' is unusually quiet in this closing arrangement, often being drowned by the last seconds of the 'Next Time' trailer and the start of the actual theme.\n\nA further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\". The fanfare over the opening bars was absent for the first time since 2010, and more of the electronic elements were removed or replaced (but the percussion and bassline were made more prominent, and the bass slides were re-instated as well) . The 'middle eight' section was also reinstated, for the first time since 2010's \"The Beast Below\".\n\nFor the 2013 Christmas special, \"The Time of the Doctor\", the theme used throughout Series 7 Part 2 was reinstated.\n\nThe arrangement of the theme was once again revisited in 2014 to mark the introduction of Peter Capaldi as the twelfth incarnation of The Doctor. This version removed the opening fanfare of the 2010–12 and 2012-13 versions, returning to the traditional opening bars with a prominent bassline, accompanied by bells and a variety of futuristic sound effects, as well as a new sting as the theme opens. This leads into the main melody, now more electronic and screech-like in homage to the Howell and Glynn themes of the 1980s. \"The Chase\" counter-melody is completely absent from this version of the theme. The 'middle eight' is absent from any broadcast version of the theme, and as such the closing credits cut straight to the main melody as they did in Series 7 Part 2. However, it was reinstated for an extended version of the theme released on the series 8 album in May 2015.\n\nAs of the third episode of Capaldi's debut season, \"Robot of Sherwood\", the new 2014 theme was suddenly polished further, blending in the intro transition sound and bass elements of the 2008 version.\n\nIn the fourth episode of the ninth series, the intro has an electric guitar playing throughout, which continues from the Doctor playing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in the pre-intro scene on an electric guitar.\n\nThe theme music received another revision in 2018 for Jodie Whittaker's first series as the Doctor, this time by new composer Segun Akinola. Akinola's version of the theme incorporates several elements of previous versions of the theme, including the melody line from the original 1963 version and cliffhanger \"sting\" introduced in 1970, remixed with newly synthesised elements and a drum-based bassline rhythm.\n\n\n\n"}

He competed in two Olympic Games, winning a team silver at the 1996 Summer Olympics and an individual gold and team bronze at the 2000 Summer Olympics. At the 1999 Pan American Games, O'Connor took an individual silver and team gold and at the 2002 World Equestrian Games he assisted the US team to gold. After his retirement from competition in 2004, he became involved in the administrative side of international eventing. O'Connor has held top coaching roles for the US and Canadian national eventing teams, and was president of the United States Equestrian Federation from 2004 to 2012. During his career, O'Connor and his horses were awarded many honors, including equestrian and horse of the year awards from several organizations. In 2009, he was inducted to the United States Eventing Association's Hall of Fame, and two of his horses have been granted the same honor. O'Connor is married to fellow international event rider Karen O'Connor, and the pair operate two equestrian training facilities in the eastern United States.\n\nO'Connor was born in Washington, D.C. His English-born mother, Sally O'Connor, was a dressage rider, judge and author. David began riding at a young age, and as a child participated in a cross-US horseback ride with his mother and brother, covering 3,000 miles over several months.\n\nO'Connor married fellow equestrian Karen O'Connor, also an international three day event rider, on June 26, 1993. The pair became the first married couple to compete on the same US Olympic equestrian team when they rode with their team to a silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. They rode to a second shared medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, again marking a historical Olympic moment as the first husband and wife duo to do so. They operate equestrian training facilities in The Plains, Virginia and Ocala, Florida. When not involved in equestrian activities, O'Connor enjoys reading and golfing.\n\nIn 1986, O'Connor began riding in international competition for the US. Early in his career, O'Connor competed in numerous high-level events as part of the US team. He acted as an alternate (substitute) rider at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Riding Wilton Fair, he was part of the US team at the 1990 World Equestrian Games, where he placed 35th individually and the team took fourth. At the 1994 World Equestrian Games, he placed 44th individually riding On a Mission and again acted as an alternate for the US team.\n\nO'Connor competed in two Olympic Games for the United States. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, he took fifth place individually, riding Custom Made. Riding a second horse, Giltedge, he also helped the US team to a silver medal. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, again riding Custom Made, he took the gold medal, and helped the US team to a bronze aboard Giltedge. During the individual competition at the 2000 Games, he led each stage of the event, and made Olympic history with a record-breaking dressage score. Observers called the ride \"accurate and precise with good cadence throughout.\" At the 1997 Badminton Horse Trials, O'Connor and Custom Made won the CCI4*, the top event at the trials, becoming only the second American pair to do so. In the 1998 World Equestrian Games, O'Connor, riding Giltedge, took an individual sixth place and helped the US team to a fourth place. Again riding Giltedge, O'Connor won silver at the 1999 Pan American Games and assisted the US team to a gold medal. The pair also rode to a team gold at the 2002 World Equestrian Games in Jerez, Spain. O'Connor was consistently ranked as one of the top three day event riders in the world by the Fédération Équestre Internationale, holding fourth place in 1996, third place in 1997 and first place in 2000. He was also the top eventing rider in the US, topping the United States Eventing Association (USEA) leaderboard, in 1998 and 1999. He was a three-time winner of the Rolex Kentucky Three Day, once at the CCI4* level and twice at the CCI3* level.\n\nIn 2002, both Custom Made and Giltedge were retired from competition. In 2004, O'Connor retired from competition and quickly became involved in administrative aspects of the three-day eventing world. He served as the President of the United States Equestrian Federation from 2004 to 2012. In 2006, O'Connor was appointed the International Technical Advisor to the Canadian national eventing team. In that capacity, he led the team to silver medals at the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2010 World Equestrian Games. In January 2013, O'Connor left the Canadian team after being appointed chef d’équipe to the US national eventing team.\n\nThe USEA named O'Connor their Rider of the Year in 1996 and 1997, and in the same years named O'Connor's horse Lightfoot was the Horse of the Year. O'Connor was also named \"The Chronicle of the Horse's\" Eventing Horseman of the Year in 1996, in combination with his wife, Karen. In 1997, O'Connor was awarded the Whitney Stone Cup, an annual award by the United States Equestrian Federation which honors \"an active competitor who displays consistent excellence in international competition and high standards of sportsmanlike conduct while serving as an ambassador for the United States and equestrian sport.\" In 1998, Lightfoot was named the USEA Horse of the Year, and in 1999, another O'Connor horse, Rattle & Hum, was awarded the honor. Rattle & Hum also took home \"The Chronicle of the Horse's \"Eventing Horse of the Year in 1999. The following year, \"The Chronicle of the Horse\" named O'Connor both Overall Horseman and Eventing Horseman of the Year, and his horse, Custom Made, was named both Overall Horse and Eventing Horse of the Year. Two years later, in 2002, Giltedge, O'Connor's other main horse, was named both Overall Horse and Eventing Horse of the Year. The United States Equestrian Federation named O'Connor their Equestrian of the Year twice, in 2000 and 2002. Also in 2002, O'Connor was awarded the USA Equestrian Sportsmanship Award. In 2009, O'Connor and Custom Made were inducted into the USEA Hall of Fame, and in 2012 Giltedge was awarded the same honor. As of 2013, four horses ridden by O'Connor (Giltedge, Custom Made, On a Mission and Wilton Fair) held positions in the list of the top 50 USEA high scoring horses.\n\n"}

He served in the Haganah at fourteen, and participated in the battles over Jerusalem in Israel's War of Independence, being wounded five times.\n\nAfter the war, he remained in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), rising through the ranks of the Armored Corps. He commanded a tank company during the 1956 Sinai Campaign, and was awarded the Medal of Courage. He was later charged with overseeing the integration of the new Centurion tank into the IDF, and later commanded the first battalion composed of these tanks.\n\nIn 1966, he was appointed commander of the 7th Brigade. It was in this capacity, during the Six-Day War, that he led his troops from the Rafah salient right up to the Suez Canal. After the war he delivered a famous speech, entitled \"My Glorious Brothers, Deserving of Fame\", which included the famous line: \"We looked death straight in the face, and it lowered its eyes at us.\"\n\nThroughout his army years, Gonen was not well liked by his subordinates, who viewed his methods as unjust and Draconian. He was known to set especially low speed limits for the men of his brigade, only to flout these speed limits himself. It was also documented in a popular Israeli book \"חשופים בצריח\" (\"\"Chasufim Batzariach\"\", \"\"Exposed in the Turret\"\") that he would deliberately cause his men to fail inspections and then punish them for it. He was overly strict, often meting out severe punishment to soldiers accused of minor offenses such as failure to polish their boots. His subordinates often requested a transfer to a different unit.\n\nIn March 1968, Gonen oversaw the armored corps in the Battle of Karameh in Jordan, where Yasser Arafat and the PLO had their base. A few armored vehicles were left on the scene and used by the PLO for propaganda. He continued to rise through the ranks, and on 15 July 1973, he replaced Ariel Sharon as Chief of the Southern Command.\n\nGonen's response to the Egyptian attack during the Yom Kippur War and his actions during the first days of fighting (culminating in the disastrous attack on Hizayon on October 8) was deemed a failure by the army's General Staff, and he was replaced on 10 October by Haim Bar-Lev. The Agranat Commission, which investigated the events leading up to the war, wrote about him that:\n\nHe was removed from all command upon the publication of the Commission's interim report, but this was revoked once the final report was released, and Gonen was given a new position on the General Staff.

According to David Wyn Jones, in his prime he was \"the single most influential musician in Vienna\".\n\nReutter was born and died in Vienna. His father Georg Reutter (the Elder) was also a notable composer. He was the 11th of 14 children and received his early musical training from his father, assisting him as court organist.\n\nA period of more formal instruction from Antonio Caldara ensued, leading to the composition of an oratorio in 1726 and, in 1727, his first opera for the imperial court, \"Archidamia\". On three separate occasions during this period, Reutter applied for a position as court organist and was each time rejected by Johann Joseph Fux. At his own expense he travelled to Italy in 1730 (possibly in 1729); in February 1730 he was in Venice and in April 1730 in Rome. He returned to Vienna in autumn 1730, and early in the following year he successfully applied for a post as court composer, the formal beginning of a lifetime of service at the Habsburg court. After his father's death he became \"Kapellmeister\" of St. Stephen's Cathedral in 1738.\n\nThe \"Kapellmeister\" position had existed since the fifteenth century and Reutter was the 27th to occupy the post. The job provided living space directly adjacent to the Cathedral, the \"Kapellhaus\" (demolished in 1803), which also housed Reutter's family and the choirboys.\n\nReutter supervised a staff of 31 musicians, as follows:\n\n\nWhen trumpets, timpani, or trombones were needed, they were recruited on an ad hoc basis, often borrowed from the musical establishment of the Imperial court (\"Hofkapelle\").\n\nAccording to Jones, the repertoire of church music \"constituted a continually unfolding tradition that is poorly served by the familiar division of the [18th] century into Baroque and Classical.\" Much of this repertoire was by Reutter himself (see Works, below); other composers prominently represented were Bonno, Tuma, and Fux.\n\nIn 1739, while visiting the town of Hainburg, Reutter auditioned the seven-year-old Joseph Haydn; Haydn joined his ensemble the following year, later to be joined by his younger brother Michael. Both served until they were teenagers and had lost their soprano voices.\n\nIt was naturally assumed that the youngsters were likely to become professional musicians in adulthood and they were trained accordingly. Joseph Haydn was given singing lessons by the tenor Ignaz Finsterbusch and taught violin by the ensemble's bass player, Adam Gegenbauer. He was also taught keyboard. The training did not include serious instruction in musical theory; this was a thirst that Joseph was able to satisfy (by studying Fux and Mattheson) only after he had left the \"Kapelle.\"\n\nThe choirboys were also given a basic ordinary education, including reading, writing, arithmetic, and some Latin. Jones suggests that \"Haydn's formal education was rather patchy, perhaps less regular than it had been in [his previous home in] Hainburg.\"\n\nThe memoirs dictated by Joseph to biographers in his old age indicate that Reutter's choristers often were underfed, thanks to Reutter's reluctance to spend money on them. Reutter was also not particularly helpful in providing feedback on Joseph's earliest efforts at musical composition.\n\nReutter later advanced to the position of court \"Kapellmeister,\" and Empress Maria Theresa gave him the sole management of the court orchestra in 1751. Reutter died in Vienna.\n\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, Reutter wrote a great deal of church music. Jones lists the following:\n\n\nReutter is believed to be the author of a setting of the \"De profundis\", KV 93, formerly ascribed to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nThe following oratorios are mentioned in Eitner's \"Quellen-Lexicon\":\n\n\nThe following stage works are listed in Eitner's \"Quellen-Lexicon\":\n\n\n\nSources\n\n"}

Trained at RADA, he then worked as an actor in repertory, and while in the company at Bideford in Devon, met the actress Asthore Lloyd Mawson (Jackie). At the start of the Second World War, as a lifelong pacifist, he registered as a conscientious objector, but soon after changed his mind and joined the anti-aircraft section of the Royal Artillery: his wartime experiences as a soldier, which are vividly described in dark detail in diaries written at the time (now held in the V&A theatre museum collection) were to mark a profound change in his life and work. In 1940, he married Jackie; in 1944 he was discharged from the army for undisclosed health reasons.\n\nFrom 1946 till 1952, while writing, he again worked as an actor, as a member of John Gielgud's company, and also, in 1951, winning first prize in the Festival of Britain play competition for \"Saint's Day\". As a working actor, he, Jackie and their two young boys led a peripatetic life moving to different lodgings around the country until settling into rooms in Jackie's aunt's house in Barnes, where he was able to find a place in the London theatre world and where his first daughter was born. In 1956, he bought and moved his family to a house in the tiny hamlet of Duddleswell, on Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, and in 1957, his second daughter was born in Crowborough. In Duddleswell he worked on many plays, film scripts and reviews on a wide mahogany table that had belonged to a hero of his, Lord Byron, writing by hand in a tiny black script adopted from the handwriting of Frederick Rolfe (Baron Corvo), or typing out the pages on a stately German typewriter, often to the accompaniment of a Beethoven piece on a rather modern stereo system.\n\nHis works include:\n\nHe also wrote un unpublished novel, \"Not a Foot of Land\", many film scripts, short stories for radio and the wartime diaries, as well as an account of his meeting and courtship of Jackie. He was drama critic for the \"London Magazine\" and a very active member of the Arts Council in encouraging new writing for the theatre.\n\n\"A Penny for a Song\" was adapted into a two-act opera by Richard Rodney Bennett, premiered at Sadler's Wells in 1967.\n\nJohn Whiting died from testicular cancer on 16 June 1963 in London at the age of 45. His obituary notice in \"The Times\" noted that\n\n\"As a dramatist John Whiting was in reach of the first rank, even if in his completed works he never quite achieved it. He was an incisive critic (for some time he wrote as drama critic of The London Magazine and his fine critical intelligence prevented him from ever, after Saint's Day, going too far, but in artistic creations those who never go too far perhaps never go quite far enough. Nevertheless in Marching Song in particular he wrote a play which seems likely to last, and at the time of his death he appeared to be at the beginning of a fruitful new phase in his career. The British theatre, even in its present flowering, can ill afford to lose the plays he might have written had he lived long enough to achieve his full potential stature.\"\n\nIn 1965, the John Whiting Award was established to commemorate the writer's contribution to post-war British theatre.\n\nIn 2015, the wartime diaries, as well as personal letters, handwritten notes, manuscripts etc. were donated by the family to the V&A.\n\n"}

Whether the rock remains weak becomes an important point in determining the potential for bigger earthquakes.\n\nOn a small scale, fractured rock behaves essentially the same throughout the world, in that the angle of friction is more or less uniform (see Fault friction). A small element of rock in a larger mass responds to stress changes in a well defined manner: if it is squeezed by differential stresses greater than its strength, it is capable of large deformations. A band of weak, fractured rock in a competent mass can deform to resemble a classic geologic fault. Using seismometers and earthquake location, the requisite pattern of micro-earthquakes can be observed.\n\nFor earthquakes, it all starts with an embedded penny-shaped crack as first envisioned by Brune. As illustrated, an earthquake zone may start as a single crack, growing to form many individual cracks and collections of cracks along a fault. The key to fault growth is the concept of a \"following force\", as conveniently provided for interplate earthquakes, by the motion of tectonic plates. Under a following force, the seismic displacements eventually form a topographic feature, such as a mountain range.\n\nIntraplate earthquakes do not have a following force, and are not associated with mountain building. Thus, there is the puzzling question of how long any interior active zone has to live. For, in a solid stressed plate, every seismic displacement acts to relieve (reduce) stress; the fault zone should come to equilibrium; and all seismic activity cease. One can see this type of arching \"lockup\" in many natural processes.\n\nIn fact, the seismic zone (such as the New Madrid Fault Zone) is ensured eternal life by the action of water. As shown, if we add the equivalent of a giant funnel to the crack, it becomes the beneficiary of stress corrosion (the progressive weakening of the crack edge by water). If there is a continuing supply of new water, the system does not come to equilibrium, but continues to grow, ever relieving stress from a larger and larger volume.\n\nThus the prerequisite for a continuing seismically active interior zone is the presence of water, the ability of the water to get down to the fault source (high permeability), and the usual high horizontal interior stresses of the rock mass. All small earthquake zones have the potential to grow to resemble New Madrid or Charlevoix.\n\n\n"}

Kaiping consists of broken terrain, mostly either rocky or swampy, with only a third of the land arable. The county is shaped like a giant question mark (see map, in pink) and includes rural areas as well as three port cities: Changsha, Xinchang, and Dihai.\n\nNotable people: \n\n\"Kaiping Diaolou\"s () are fortified multi-storey towers constructed in the village countryside of mainly the Kaiping area. They were built from the early Qing Dynasty to the early 20th century, reaching a peak in the 1920s and 1930s, with the financial aid of overseas Chinese, when there were more than three thousand of these structures. Today, approximately 1,800 \"diaolou\" are still standing, with the most in the towns of Tangkou (), Baihe (), Chikan (), and Xiangang (), in that order (see map in article by Batto).\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Kaiping was a region of major emigration abroad, and a melting pot of ideas and trends brought back by overseas Chinese, \"Huaqiao\", made good. As a consequence, many watchtowers incorporated architectural features from China and the West. These were examples of the Qiaoxiang () architecture. The \"diaolou\" were built by villagers during a time of chaos and served two purposes: housing and protecting against forays by bandits.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Kaiping diaolou and villages\" were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and consist of four separate restored village areas: Zilicun village () in Tangkou, Sanmenli village () in Chikan, Jinjiangli village () in Xiangang, and Majianglong village cluster () in Baihe township.\n\nThe Kaiping diaolou was the location for parts of the filming of 2010 movie \"Let the Bullets Fly\" ().\n\nExamples of diaolous include:\n\nChikan () is officially designated as a National Historic and Cultural Town of China (). The old town of Chikan has many historical sites that are about one hundred years old. For example, it has over 600 late-Qing and early-Republic historic Tong laus or Qilous () continuous, spanning over a length of 3 kilometers, including the riverside stretch along Dixi Lu (), sometimes referred to as 'European Styled Street'. Part of old Chikan town has been designated Chikan Studio City () for filming of historical scenes.\n\nChikan township also has two restored diaolous: \"Yinglonglou\", built by the Guan () lineage in the Ming dynasty, and \"Nanlou\", memorialized by the martyrdom of seven Situ clan () members in the early 20th century.\n\nHistorically, Chikan has been shaped by these two competing clans. One example is the existence of two libraries: the \"Situ's library\", opened in 1926, and, not to be outdone, the \"Guan's library\", opened in 1931; both libraries funded by overseas Chinese and incorporated architecture features from overseas.\n\nIt is a famous and well-known location for braised pork in noodles to locals.\n\nChikan is to become a tourist destination and the closing of local stores, dining posts, and streets are scheduled for the summer of 2017.\n\nKaiping has been twinned with Mesa, Arizona, United States, since October 18, 1993.\n\nKaiping was a major source of emigrants at the turn of the 20th century. As a result, a large number of early Chinese Canadian and Chinese American communities had people who originated from Kaiping and its neighboring counties of Taishan, Enping and Xinhui, which is known collectively as Sze Yup. It is said that there are more Kaipingnese people living abroad today than there are Kaipingnese in Kaiping.

{"id": "1943904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943904", "title": "Tamburlaine", "text": "Tamburlaine\n\nTamburlaine the Great is a play in two parts by Christopher Marlowe. It is loosely based on the life of the Central Asian emperor, Timur (Tamerlane/Timur the Lame, d. 1405). Written in 1587 or 1588, the play is a milestone in Elizabethan public drama; it marks a turning away from the clumsy language and loose plotting of the earlier Tudor dramatists, and a new interest in fresh and vivid language, memorable action, and intellectual complexity. Along with Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\", it may be considered the first popular success of London's public stage.\n\nMarlowe, generally considered the best of that group of writers known as the University Wits, influenced playwrights well into the Jacobean period, and echoes of the bombast and ambition of \"Tamburlaine\"s language can be found in English plays all the way to the Puritan closing of the theatres in 1642. While \"Tamburlaine\" is considered inferior to the great tragedies of the late-Elizabethan and early-Jacobean period, its significance in creating a stock of themes and, especially, in demonstrating the potential of blank verse in drama, is still acknowledged.\n\nWhereas the real Timur was of Turkic-Mongolian ancestry and belonged to the nobility, for dramatic purposes Marlowe depicts him as a Scythian shepherd who rises to the rank of emperor.\n\nPart 1 opens in Persepolis. The Persian emperor, Mycetes, dispatches troops to dispose of Tamburlaine, a Scythian shepherd and, at that point, a nomadic bandit. In the same scene, Mycetes' brother Cosroe plots to overthrow Mycetes and assume the throne.\n\nThe scene shifts to Scythia, where Tamburlaine is shown wooing, capturing, and winning Zenocrate, the daughter of the Egyptian king. Confronted by Mycetes' soldiers, he persuades first the soldiers and then Cosroe to join him in a fight against Mycetes. Although he promises Cosroe the Persian throne, Tamburlaine reneges on this promise and, after defeating Mycetes, takes personal control of the Persian Empire.\n\nNow a powerful figure, Tamburlaine turns his attention to Bajazeth, emperor of the Turks. He defeats Bajazeth and his tributary kings, capturing the emperor and his wife Zabina. The victorious Tamburlaine keeps the defeated ruler in a cage and feeds him scraps from his table, releasing Bajazeth only to use him as a footstool. Bajazeth later kills himself on stage by bashing his head against the bars upon hearing of Tamburlaine's next victory. Upon finding his body, Zabina does likewise.\n\nAfter conquering Africa and naming himself emperor of that continent, Tamburlaine sets his eyes on Damascus, a target which places the Egyptian sultan, his to-be father-in-law, directly in his path. Zenocrate pleads with her future husband to spare her father. He complies, instead making the sultan a tributary king. The play ends with the wedding of Tamburlaine and Zenocrate, who is crowned Empress of Persia.\n\nIn Part 2, Tamburlaine grooms his sons to be conquerors in his wake as he continues to attack neighbouring kingdoms. His oldest son, Calyphas, preferring to stay by his mother's side and not risk death, incurs Tamburlaine's wrath. Meanwhile, the son of Bajazeth, Callapine, escapes from Tamburlaine's jail and gathers a group of tributary kings to his side, planning to avenge his father. Callapine and Tamburlaine meet in battle, where Tamburlaine is victorious. But finding that Calyphas remained in his tent during the battle, Tamburlaine kills him in anger. Tamburlaine then forces the defeated kings to pull his chariot to his next battlefield, declaring,\nUpon reaching Babylon, which holds out against him, Tamburlaine displays further acts of extravagant savagery. When the governor of the city attempts to save his life in return for revealing the city treasury, Tamburlaine has him hanged from the city walls and shot. He orders the inhabitants—men, women, and children—to be bound and thrown into a nearby lake. Lastly, Tamburlaine scornfully burns a copy of the Qur'an and claims to be greater than God. \nIn the final act, he becomes ill but manages to defeat one more foe before he dies. He bids his sons to conquer the remainder of the earth as he departs life.\n\n\n\nThe play (in both parts) was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 August 1590. Both parts were published together in a single black letter octavo that same year by the printer Richard Jones; its text is usually referred to as O1. A second edition was issued by Jones in 1592, and a third reprint appeared in 1597, essentially reprinting the text of the first edition. The plays were next published separately in quarto by the bookseller Edward White, \"Part 1\" in 1605 and \"Part 2\" in 1606, which reprinted the text of the 1597 printing.\n\nAlthough Christopher Marlowe was not actually cited as the author in the first printings of the play – no author is named – and the first clear attributions to Marlowe are much later than 1590, scholars attribute the play to Marlowe based on similarities to his other works. Many passages in \"Tamburlaine\" foreshadow and echo passages from others of his works, and there is a clear parallel between the character development in \"Tamburlaine\" and that of the majority of Marlowe's other characters. This evidence alone leads scholars to believe with virtual unanimity that Marlowe wrote \"Tamburlaine\".\n\nThe influence of \"Tamburlaine\" on the drama of the 1590s cannot be overstated. The play exemplified, and in some cases created, many of the typical features of high Elizabethan drama: grandiloquent and often beautiful imagery, hyperbolic expression, and strong characters consumed by overwhelming passions. The first recorded comments on the play are negative. A letter written in 1587 relates the story of a child being killed by the accidental discharge of a firearm during a performance, and the next year Robert Greene, in the course of an attack on Marlowe, condemned the \"atheistic Tamburlaine\" in the epistle to \"Perimedes the Blacksmith\". That most playgoers (and playwrights) responded with enthusiasm is amply demonstrated by the proliferation of Asian tyrants and \"aspiring minds\" in the drama of the 1590s. Marlowe's influence on many characters in Shakespeare's history plays has been noted by, among others, Algernon Swinburne. Stephen Greenblatt considers it likely that \"Tamburlaine\" was among the first London plays that Shakespeare saw, an experience that directly inspired his early work such as the three Henry VI plays.\n\nBy the early years of the 17th century, this hyberbolic language had gone out of style. Shakespeare himself puts a speech from Tamburlaine in the mouth of his play-addled soldier Pistol (\"2 Henry IV\" II.4.155). In \"Timber\", Ben Jonson condemned \"the Tamerlanes and Tamer-chams of the late age, which had nothing in them but the scenical strutting and furious vociferation to warrant them to the ignorant gapers\".\n\nSubsequent ages of critics have not reversed the position advanced by Jonson that the language and events in plays such as \"Tamburlaine\" are unnatural and ultimately unconvincing. Still, the play was regarded as the text above all others \"wherein the whole restless temper of the age finds expression\" (Long). Robert Fletcher notes that Marlowe \"gained a high degree of flexibility and beauty by avoiding a regularly end-stopped arrangement, by taking pains to secure variety of pause and accent, and by giving his language poetic condensation and suggestiveness\" (Fletcher). In his poem on Shakespeare, Jonson mentions \"Marlowe's mighty line\", a phrase critics have accepted as just, as they have also Jonson's claim that Shakespeare surpassed it. But while Shakespeare is commonly seen to have captured a far greater range of emotions than his contemporary, Marlowe retains a significant place as the first genius of blank verse in English drama.\n\nThe play is often linked to Renaissance humanism which idealises the potential of human beings. Tamburlaine's aspiration to immense power raises profound religious questions as he arrogates for himself a role as the \"scourge of God\" (an epithet originally applied to Attila the Hun). Some readers have linked this stance with the fact that Marlowe was accused of atheism. Others have been more concerned with a supposed anti-Muslim thread of the play, highlighted in a scene in which the main character burns the Qur'an.\n\nJeff Dailey notes in his article \"Christian Underscoring in \"Tamburlaine the Great, Part II\"\" that Marlowe's work is a direct successor to the traditional medieval morality plays, and that, whether or not he is an atheist, he has inherited religious elements of content and allegorical methods of presentation.\n\nThe first part of \"Tamburlaine\" was performed by the Admiral's Men late in 1587, around a year after Marlowe's departure from Cambridge University. Edward Alleyn performed the role of Tamburlaine, and it apparently became one of his signature roles. The play's popularity, significant enough to prompt Marlowe to produce the sequel, led to numerous stagings over the next decade.\n\nThe stratification of London audiences in the early Jacobean period changed the fortunes of the play. For the sophisticated audiences of private theatres such as Blackfriars and (by the early 1610s) the Globe Theatre, Tamburlaine's \"high astounding terms\" were a relic of a simpler dramatic age. Satiric playwrights occasionally mimicked Marlowe's style, as John Marston does in the induction to \"Antonio and Mellida\".\n\nWhile it is likely that \"Tamburlaine\" was still revived in the large playhouses, such as the Red Bull Theatre, that catered to traditional audiences, there is no surviving record of a Renaissance performance after 1595. \"Tamburlaine\" suffered more from the change in fashion than did Marlowe's other plays like \"Doctor Faustus\" or \"The Jew of Malta\" of which there are allusions to performances. Edward Phillips, in his \"Theatrum Poetarum\" (1675), is so unfamiliar with the play that he attributes its writing to Thomas Newton. A further sign of the obscurity this one-time audience favourite had fallen into is offered by playwright Charles Saunders. Having written his own play in 1681 on Tamburlaine, he was accused by critics of having plagiarised Marlowe's work, to which he replied,\n\nFollowing the Glorious Revolution of 1688, a tradition developed in Ireland of performing the play in Dublin on the anniversary of William of Orange's birthday. This was brought to an end in 1713 when the government banned a performance of the play because it included a controversial prologue including the phrase \"No Peace Without Spain\".\n\nIn 1919, the Yale Dramatic Association staged a \"Tamburlaine\" which edited and combined both parts of Marlowe's play. A revival of both parts in a condensed form was presented at The Old Vic in September 1951, with Donald Wolfit in the title role. For the Stratford Shakespeare Festival (now the Stratford Festival of Canada) in 1956, Tyrone Guthrie directed another dual version, starring Donald Wolfit, William Shatner, Robert Christie and Louis Negin; it travelled to Broadway, where it failed to impress—Eric Bentley, among others, panned it— although Anthony Quayle, who replaced Wolfit in the title role, received a Tony Award nomination for his performance, as did Guthrie for his direction.\n\nThe Royal National Theatre production in 1976 featured Albert Finney in the title role; this production opened the new Olivier Theatre on the South Bank. Peter Hall directed. This production is generally considered the most successful of the rare modern productions.\n\nIn 1993 the Royal Shakespeare Company performed an award-winning production of the play, with Antony Sher as Tamburlaine and Tracy Ann Oberman as Olympia.\n\nJeff Dailey directed both parts of the play, uncut, at the American Theatre of Actors in New York City. He presented Part I in 1997 and Part II in 2003, both in the outdoor theatre located in the courtyard of 314 West 54th Street.\n\nAvery Brooks played the lead role in a production of the play for the Shakespeare Theatre Company. The play ran from 28 October 2007 to 6 January 2008 and was directed by Michael Kahn. \n\nA new production combining Parts I and II (\"trimming Marlowe’s two five-act plays to three hours of stage time [with a half-hour intermission]\") edited and directed by Michael Boyd opened at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center, Brooklyn, New York on 16 November 2014 with John Douglas Thompson as Tamburlaine, Merritt Janson as Zenocrate/Callapine and a \"large, multipurpose ensemble\" cast.\n\nA production of Tamburlaine was delivered by the Lazarus Theatre Company in London West End at the Tristan Bates Theatre between 25 August and 12 September 2015.\n\nOn 1 November 2014, Tamburlaine opened at Theatre for a New Audience where it won the 2015 Obie Award for John Douglas Thompson's Performance. It closed on 14 January 2015.\n\nIn August 2018, the Royal Shakespeare Company began a run of Tamburlaine in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.\n\nWhile the play has been revived periodically over the past century, the obstacles it presents—a large cast and an actor capable of performing in such a challenging role chief among them—have prevented more widespread performance. In general, the modern playgoer may still echo F. P. Wilson's question, asked at mid-century, \"How many of us can boast that we are more than readers of Tamburlaine?\"\n\nIn November 2005, a production of \"Tamburlaine\" at the Barbican Arts Centre in London was accused of deferring to Muslim sensibilities by amending a section of the play in which the title character burns the Quran and excoriates the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The sequence was changed so that Tamburlaine instead defiles books representing all religious texts. The director denied censoring the play, stating that the change was a \"purely artistic\" decision \"to focus the play away from anti-Turkish pantomime to an existential epic\".\n\nThere have been two adaptations on BBC radio, both of which have combined both parts into one broadcast. The first was on BBC Radio 3 on 26 September 1993 and directed by Michael Fox, starring Michael Pennington as Tamburlaine, Samantha Bond as Zenocrate, Clive Rowe as Theridamas, Louis Hilyer as Techelks, Peter Guinness as Usumcasane, Rudolph Walker as Bajazeth/Orcanes and Timothy Walker as Mycetes/Calyphas. The second adaptation, again on BBC Radio 3, was broadcast on 16 September 2012 and directed by Peter Kavanagh, with Con O'Neill as Tamburlaine, Susie Riddell as Zenocrate, Oliver Ford Davies as Mycetes, Kenneth Cranham as Cosroe, Shaun Prendergast as Techelles, Ewan Bailey as Theridamas and Edward de Souza as the Sultan.\nKlingon Tamburlaine, an unofficial fan production adapted from Christopher Marlowe’s Tamburlaine the Great, Parts I and II and reset in the Star Trek universe, was performed at the Hollywood Fringe Festival in 2019.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1943920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943920", "title": "Afrikaner cattle", "text": "Afrikaner cattle\n\nThe Afrikaner, also known as the Africander, is a breed of taurine-indicine (\"Sanga\") cattle indigenous to South Africa.\n\nHuge herds of Sanga type cattle were herded by the Khoikhoi (Hottentots) when the Dutch established the Cape Colony in 1652. Although African cattle breeds originated from domesticized Auerochsen in the Middle East, there has been considerable introgression from wild African cattle (Bos Taurus Africanus) in North Africa, from the 8th millennium B. C. onwards, Only two independent domestication events can be traced for the founding populations of cattle, the second being that of the Indian Zebu (Bos Indicus). However genetic studies indicate that African cattle breed are clearly distinct from European and Middle Eastern cattle by the crossbreeding with wild North African cattle (Bos Taurus Africanus), especially in the maternal line. At the same time African cattle have a great genetic variability. This indicates that crossbreeding with strains of wild African auerochsen must have happened in different regions, with local strains. The aim was to introduce desirable traits such as environmental adaptation and resistance to disease and parasites. This led to the development of specialised breeds of African cattle. Only much later, from 1500 B. C. on did crossbreeding with Zebuine cattle begin in Ethiopia and East Africa creating the ‘Sanga’ type. This was done mostly in the male line, with Indian bulls. This means that African cattle both of the more ‘taurine’ and the more ‘zebuine’ lineage share a rich heritage of wild African cattle, especially in the maternal lines, explaining their specific features and adaptations. For the Afrikaaner cattle this means that their specific character is not only to be explained by the Zebuine admixture, such as the marked hump. They are indigenous African heritage. This may be observed in the long lyra-shaped horns, which were already depicted on Ancient Egyptian murals. They also characterise the White Fulani cattle of the Sahel, as well as the more Sanga types. (Elder photos of Afrikaaner cattle often show their horns to be somewhat more upright, than at present.) These breeds also share other features of stature and hardiness, fertility and endurance with the Afrikaaner cattle. For the understanding of Afrikaaner cattle and their special valuable traits, comparisons with other African breeds might thus be fruitful, to assess the genetic contribution of African wild cattle. \n\nIt is believed that the ancestors of Afrikaner cattle originated on the Asian steppes, before migrating into Africa about 2000 years ago. Cattle moved gradually southwards through the continent. Afrikaners share coancestry with the Nguni and Drakensberger breeds. They most likely diverged 655–960 years ago. Anecdotal evidence from Portuguese sailors suggest that herds of Afrikaner-like cattle had been kept by the Khoikhoi since at least the 15th Century.\n\nThe breed almost became extinct in the early 20th century during the Second Boer War, their numbers depleted through destruction and due to an outbreak of Rinderpest that halved the country's total cattle population. After the war, programs were put in place to improve the breed.\n\nIn 1912, the first Afrikaner studbook was formed in South Africa in order to control the breed's development. However, due to the recently depleted numbers of Afrikaner cattle, a high degree of inbreeding occurred at this time.\n\nIn 1923, it was proposed that Afrikaners be sent to the United States, and in 1932 the US government imported a herd to introduce new blood to the Gulf Coast. In 1929, a bull and two cows (one a calf) were gifted to the King George V by the Africander Cattle Breeders' Society of South Africa. The first five Afrikaners arrived in Australia in 1953 and were taken to the CSIRO's Belmont station for research into their adaptability to the Australian climate. They were imported from Texas and Florida.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Afrikaners were being bred to reduce the size of their hump, as this was unsightly to farmers used to the taurine cattle shape.\n\nThe Afrikaner was the most abundant cattle breed in South Africa until the 1970s, however, problems associated with inbreeding, lowered fertility and decreased reproductive period in cows decreased their popularity among local farmers. Crossbreeding with exotic cattle breeds may have also contributed to the decline in population numbers, as well as the introduction of the Brahman to southern Africa.\n\nAfrikaners are usually deep red. The colour schema of the Afrikaaner with its shades of red to ochre, sometimes darker, is reminiscent of the lighter forms of Auerochsen, which have been prevalent in the races of southern Europe and North Africa. While sexual dimorphism of colour was the rule, the lighter varieties had a more or less uniform brownish red, as the Afrikaaner cattle. D. Foidl explains: “This colour scheme is completely reddish brown with a dark eel stripe and dark forelocks, and having no black hair except for the tail tip. This colour scheme is similar to that of Banteng cows and found in wildtype-coloured domestic cows.” Some Afrikaner bulls have a fine light eel-stripe on the back, darker shaded shoulders and some locks on the forehead. They also have the small cervices-thoracic hump typical of Sanga cattle. The small hump of Sanga cattle is a trait essentially preserved from the Auerochsen. It is observable in the curvilinear back line of the Spanish Lidia, for example. It is distinguishable from the more lumpy hump of the Zebu cattle, and also differently placed. Only in some individuals a more Zebuine fat hump appears. A variety of traits appear to indicate that the Afrikaaner is a not too 'derived' breed that has preserved a variety of original traits, including some Zebuine influence.\n\nThe Afrikaner is a well-muscled breed, with long legs and a shallow body. They have long, lateral horns that turn upwards, although these are often polled in commercial operations. Bulls weigh 820–1,090 kg, and cows weigh 450–600 kg. The legs are slightly sickle shaped. They have good resistance to tick-borne diseases. They are well adapted to the local hot, arid conditions, as the sweat glands in their skin are more active than those of taurine cattle. This makes them more tolerant of heat than European breeds. They are more economical to keep, and a greater number of Afrikaners can be kept on the same plot of land as European cattle. They have a good temperament and are easy to handle.\n\nAfrikaners have good fertility, and can continue to calve over the age of 16 years, with records showing cows calving at 21. The cows are very maternal, and one female will often care for a number of calves while their mothers graze elsewhere. They have few calving problems, due to the structure of their hindquarters and small calf sizes (30–35 kg). They have a low calf mortality rate.\n\nThere is a medium to high degree of genetic variation within this breed with a low inbreeding coefficient, despite the historic decline in numbers.\n\nThe Khoikhoi used the Afrikaners for meat and milk. Afrikaners were used primarily as draught animals after European settlement, often driven in large teams with as many as 14 animals. They were bred and developed to better suit this purpose, and were prized by the voortrekkers. They were also used as dairy cows, though less commonly, producing higher butterfat contents than other cattle breeds, without the need for supplementary feed. It was Afrikaner oxen which drew the wagons that carried the Voortrekkers on the Great Trek.\n\nAfrikaners are used commercially to produce beef, and are often crossbred with other breeds in order to improve meat quality, particularly in regards to tenderness, as well as their greater ability to add weight on poor quality forage. The South African breed society promotes the use of Afrikaners as a dam line for crossbreeding.\n\nCrossbreeding with Afrikaners increases the heat tolerance of taurine breeds.\n\nBonsmara cattle are the result of crossing Afrikaners with Herefords and Shorthorns. They were developed during the 1960s.\n\nBelmont Red cattle are the result of crossing Afrikaners with Herefords and Shorthorns by the CSIRO in Rockhampton, Queensland. They were bred in an effort to produce a breed that was better suited to beef production in hot, dry areas.\n\nThe Afrigus is a modern 50–50 hybrid of Afrikaner and Aberdeen Angus, with some influence of Bonsmara, Drakensberger and Tuli. An Afrikaner–Angus cross developed in the 1930s in Louisiana – sometimes called Africangus – was unsuccessful.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1943953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943953", "title": "Going for Gold", "text": "Going for Gold\n\nGoing for Gold is a British television game show that originally aired on BBC1 between 12 October 1987 and 9 July 1996. It was revived for Channel 5 from 13 October 2008 to 20 March 2009.\n\n\"Going for Gold\" was originally broadcast on BBC1 from 12 October 1987 to 9 July 1996, usually, after the lunchtime broadcast of Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\". It was presented by Irish broadcaster Henry Kelly, and its defining concept was that it featured contestants from different European countries who competed against each other to answer questions (all in English) to win a prize. The show was shown on BBC1 in the UK and on Super Channel (later NBC Super Channel) in Continental Europe and on BBC TV Europe (which carried a mix of BBC1 and BBC2 output up to its dissolution in early 1991).\n\nThe 1987–1996 run of the quiz show each week had seven contestants that spoke English (each representing a different European country, although each of the home nations of the United Kingdom fielded their own contestants) who would compete against each other for a place in the finals. The show followed a repechage format (now common, but then, unusual), whereby unsuccessful contestants from Monday's show would return on Tuesday, and so on throughout the week. Each episode lasted for 25 minutes, including four rounds.\n\nThere were ten series in total (two in 1992). The first five series were broadcast during the winter, and many of these were split in half by the Christmas break. The (second) 1992 and 1993 series went out in the autumn, the last three were broadcast during the summer. The 1996 series featured competitors from the United Kingdom only.\n\nThe show was revived and produced by Talkback Thames and aired on Channel 5, premiering from 13 October to 19 December 2008. The new version featured only contestants from the UK and Ireland, was broadcast live and hosted by newsreader John Suchet. Former ITV Play host Alex Kramer, did the newly introduced viewers' phone-in question section from 17 November 2008 until 20 March 2009, repeating the questions several times and talking to the selected phone-in contestant. The set questions involve many clues to an item or person, and the phone-ins were notorious for taking up significant amounts of time during the show.\n\nThe show continued its run between 5 January and 20 March 2009. Vicky Letch temporarily replaced Alex Kramer as the viewer's phone-in host whilst Alex was on holiday. When John Suchet was unavailable, the programme was hosted by Dean Wilson. At the end of the series, the sixteen winners with the most daily wins contested four semi-finals, the winners of which competed in the series final on 20 March 2009, won by Iwan Thomas.\n\nEach edition began with a short general knowledge round to all seven contestants. Out of the contestants who started the show, four would go through to the next round (always referred to as the \"first round proper\" by Kelly). These four would be the first who managed to answer each of the four general knowledge questions correctly. These questions would usually take the form of a 20 to 30-second description of an object, person, animal or place (usually beginning \"Who am I?\", \"What am I?\", etc.), with progressively more details being revealed by Kelly until someone was able to identify it. By the Thursday show, there would be only four contestants left to play the opening round and so several questions were asked and the first person to two points would join the previous days' winners in \"the first round proper\".\n\nThis round was not played in the 2008 version.\n\nThe Beat the Buzzer round was a general knowledge round, played with hands on plungers. Questions were worth one, two or three points. A contestant who gave a correct answer would be told the subject of the next question, and got to choose the value of that question. If nobody answered a question correctly, the next question was described as \"a general knowledge question\" and worth one point — but was in fact the next question that was going to be asked anyway. The first three players to reach six points or nine in the 2008 version went on to play the next round.\n\nIn the event that a contestant buzzed in and got a question wrong, the question would be offered to other contestants, signaled by a buzzer sounding. But a contestant buzzing in and giving no answer at all would result in a doorbell sound and the answer was revealed\n\nIn this round, each of the remaining contestants were asked to pick a category (out of a choice of four). The order in which they picked the categories was based on the order in which they progressed from the previous round. Each would then have to answer questions on their chosen category for 40 seconds.\n\nPlayers scored based on the number of consecutive questions they got right – if an incorrect answer was given, their score returned to zero. The score taken from this round was the highest point reached over 40 seconds. After this round, the two highest scoring players went through to the final round. A \"first to two\" general knowledge playoff was held if there was a tie, using the same style of questions from round 1.\n\nIn the final, every question was worth between four and one point depending on how quickly they were answered. Again, the questions pertained to a famous person, place, thing, fictional character or event. However, only one player at a time was allowed to the buzzer, as indicated by a timer graphic running down the center of the screen. If a player gave an incorrect answer, their section of the time was passed over to their opponent and the time (and the question) continued.\n\nIn the original, the first player to score nine points won the game. While in the 2008 revival, this round kept on playing until time was up. When time was up, the player with the most points won £1,000 and competed against three new players on the next programme.\n\nThe first player to reach nine points in this round won the daily game, and went through to the end of week final (an automatic place in the 'first round proper' on Thursday), from where, the winner progressed to the later stages of the series. The losing players all came back the next day, starting with the same pool of players each weekday, minus the winner of the week's earlier shows. The weekly final had the three daily winners directly through to Beat the Buzzer with the final spot decided in the Elimination Round where the first to answer two questions correctly progressed. The winner of the weekly final advanced to one of two Semi-Final weeks.\n\nThe Semi-Final weeks occurred at the end of each half of the season with between 7–10 weekly winners (depending upon season length). Each week was made up of four daily heats with the winner of each heat advancing to Finals week and the losing players returning each day (there was no weekly final). By this point the contestants were buzzing in noticeably earlier as the standard of competition increased.\n\nThe Finals week consisted of eight winners from the Semi-Finals (four from each week) competing in a standard week format of three daily heats with the winners advancing to the Grand Final (directly to the Beat the Buzzer round). The Grand Final episode would start with a \"First-to-Two\" Elimination Round amongst the remaining five contestants and play as normal to the Head to Head where the winner would receive the star prize holiday (as described in every episode) and the runner-up would get a consolation prize (e.g. a colour television, or a gold-plated Going for Gold plate).\n\nThe 2008 revival added a Finals week inviting back sixteen contestants from the series (all winners of the international special episodes and contestants with the most daily wins). This week consisted of four daily heats with the winners earning £1,000 and advancing to the Grand Final episode where that week's prize money was rolled up to award £5,000 to the champion. All shows ran using the normal format for that series.\n\n\"Going for Gold\" began its life as an American pilot, \"Run for the Money\", hosted by Bill Rafferty and produced for ABC in 1987, at ABC Television Center. The pilot did not sell in the States; however, Grundy took it to Europe where it became what is now \"Going for Gold\". \"Run for the Money\" would have been played with four contestants (one a returning champion) starting with the Beat the Buzzer round. The winner of each episode received $5,000, and any contestant who won five consecutive games retired undefeated and had their winnings increased to $50,000.\n\nThe programme has been adapted in France, where it became a very famous game show \"\", which still airs today on France 3, is hosted by Samuel Étienne since February 2016, replacing long-time fixture Julien Lepers (November 1988 – February 2016).\n\nThe Channel 5 quiz \"One to Win\" was a half-hour show whose format was effectively based on the latter three rounds of \"Going for Gold\", repackaged and with a different host (initially, Paul Roseby, who was soon replaced by Robin Houston, known as the 'voice of the computer' on another Channel 5 quiz show, \"100%\"). Unlike \"Going for Gold\" but like \"100%\", \"One to Win\" featured low cash prizes for the first player to reach 21 points in the head-to-head round – just £200 per episode but with a bonus for five consecutive wins – and offered its champions the option to return on the next edition of the show.\n\n"}

It was opened in 1934 as a result of the club's former stadium being too small. Upon completion, it could hold 22,000 spectators, but accommodating up to 29,500 at its maximum. Increasing safety requirements gradually reduced this number to 19,000.\nOver time, as Ajax's popularity and success grew, the De Meer proved to be too small. From 1928 onward, Ajax played their big European games at the Olympic Stadium. The larger venue also hosted Ajax's midweek night games, since the De Meer was not suited for floodlights. The De Meer was abandoned with the opening of the purpose built Amsterdam Arena in 1996, since 2018-2019 the Johan Cruyff Arena.\n\nThe Dutch national football team played five international matches at the stadium, winning all of them. The first one, on August 22, 1973 was a qualifying match for the 1974 FIFA World Cup against Iceland (5-0). The last one, played on March 25, 1992, was a friendly against Yugoslavia (2-0).\n\nFollowing the club's departure, the De Meer was demolished to make way for a housing development. However, the area is commemorated by having the new streets named after famous football stadia from around the world.

{"id": "1943963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943963", "title": "Virginia Reel (solitaire)", "text": "Virginia Reel (solitaire)\n\nVirginia Reel is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of 52 playing cards mixed together. The object of the game is to place all the cards in the 24 foundations.\n\nFirst three cards, a 2, a 3, and a 4, are placed vertically. Then, beside each of the three cards is a row of seven cards. The first card in each row shows that it is the row for all other cards with the same rank. The first row is known as the \"2s' row,\" the second row the \"3s' row,\" and the third row the \"4s' row.\" \n\nA fourth row of eight cards is dealt. This serves as the reserve with each card forming a pile.\n\nThe foundations are built up by suit in intervals of three, as illustrated in the table below.\nTo play, a card can be moved to a foundation or to a rightful row from the other rows or from the reserve. But the player has to bear in mind that when a card is moved from anywhere in the tableau, \"the gap it leaves behind must be filled with a card appropriate for the row where the gap is located\". For instance, when a card has left the 2s' row, the gap it left behind must be filled with a 2, either from the other rows or from the reserve. This is especially true at the beginning of the game, where some cards are on each other's rows like a 4 in the 3s' row and a 3 in the 4s' row. Exchanging cards to their rightful rows in this case is also possible.\n\nWhile the first card in each row is already a foundation in itself and it can be built on, once a card ends up in its proper row no matter where in the row, it becomes a foundation itself.\n\nThe top cards in the reserve are in play and can be placed on the foundations, or be placed on a row (if it is a 2, 3, or 4), but empty piles are not filled until a new batch of eight cards are dealt every time no more moves are possible.\n\nAces play no part in this game. Any ace that is in the reserve is immediately discarded. But an ace in any of the rows must be replaced by any applicable card for that row. So in order to discard an ace from the 2s' row, for example, a 2 must be available to replace it.\n\nThe game is considered won when all the cards are in foundations, with all face cards on top.\n\nRoyal Parade is another solitaire card game which is played much the same way as Virginia Reel. The difference between this game and Virginia Reel is that in Royal Parade when a card is moved from anywhere in the tableau, the gap it leaves behind \"does not have to be filled right away\". It can be filled later by a card appropriate for the row that the gap is located in.\n"}

The community inherits the former name of the present-day municipality which it belongs to. \n\nNewcastle is located about 80 km east of Toronto, and about 18 km east of Oshawa and Bowmanville on Highway 401. It is also the southern terminus of Highway 35 and Highway 115. It has been named one of the best small towns in Ontario, by \"Comfort Life\", a website for retirement living in Canada.\n\nNewcastle was incorporated as a town in 1856. It remained a small community until the 1990s, when new residential development began and the population quickly swelled. Newcastle had a jail in the late 1800s. Maps of Newcastle from those years have not been discovered. Many have tried to find the location of this jail, but it is believed that it was either demolished or destroyed by the elements. There are jail cells in the Newcastle Community Hall.\n\nNewcastle is surrounded by farms raising cattle, pigs, apples, grain, and corn. The town has a community hall, donated by the Massey family, one public high school (Clarke), two public elementary schools (Newcastle Public School and The Pines Senior Public School), one Catholic elementary school (St. Francis of Assisi), a post office, churches, a few plazas, several small parks, six restaurants, Tim Hortons, a recreation complex, an ice arena, a new fire hall, two grocery stores (Foodland and No Frills), professional offices, hardware stores, a marina on Lake Ontario, and a golf course (Newcastle Golf Course).\n\nThe first Post office was opened in Newcastle in 1845 with John Short serving as Postmaster. Since that time, Newcastle has had ten postmasters with Charles Gray being the last (in 1991). Following Gray's retirement, Canada Post closed the Post Office since it was deemed too small. Most rural route and suburban mail is now handled by the Bowmanville Canada Post. \n\n\nThe name \"Town of Newcastle\" was used from 1973–94 for the municipality now called the Municipality of Clarington. The name was changed in 1994 to alleviate longstanding confusion between the municipality as a whole and the community of the same name. The community was commonly known as \"Newcastle Village\" to distinguish the two. It was also a confusing fact that Bowmanville had a larger population than \"Newcastle Village\", and it also housed the former Town of Newcastle's municipal offices, causing some to believe the town should have been called \"Bowmanville\" instead of \"Newcastle\" during that period.\n\n\n\n"}

The technology, which is similar to the Monsanto process, was developed by BP Chemicals and is under license by BP Plc. The process is based on an iridium-containing catalyst, such as the complex [Ir(CO)I] (1).\n\nThe Cativa and Monsanto processes are sufficiently similar that they can use the same chemical plant. Initial studies by Monsanto had shown iridium to be less active than rhodium for the carbonylation of methanol. Subsequent research, however, showed that the iridium catalyst could be promoted by ruthenium, and this combination leads to a catalyst that is superior to the rhodium-based systems. The switch from rhodium to iridium also allows the use of less water in the reaction mixture. This change reduces the number of drying columns necessary, decreases formation of by-products, such as propionic acid, and suppresses the water gas shift reaction.\n\nThe catalytic cycle for the Cativa process, shown above, begins with the reaction of methyl iodide with the square planar active catalyst species (1) to form the octahedral iridium(III) species (2), the \"fac\"-isomer of [Ir(CO)(CH)I]. This oxidative addition reaction involves the formal insertion of the iridium(I) centre into the carbon-iodine bond of methyl iodide. After ligand exchange (iodide for carbon monoxide), the migratory insertion of carbon monoxide into the iridium-carbon bond, step (3) to (4), results in the formation of a square pyramidal species with a bound acetyl ligand. The active catalyst species (1) is regenerated by the reductive elimination of acetyl iodide from (4), a de-insertion reaction. The acetyl iodide is hydrolysed to produce the acetic acid product, in the process generating hydroiodic acid which is in turn used to convert the starting material (methanol) to the methyl iodide used in the first step.\n"}

The puppet had been made in 1933 for Hogarth Puppets. The original TV programmes featuring the character were presented by Annette Mills, sister of John Mills, and broadcast live by the BBC from their studios at Alexandra Palace from 1946 to 1952. Mills and the puppet continued with programmes that were broadcast until 1955, when Annette Mills died. The series then transferred to ITV in 1956 and 1957. A modern animated version of \"Muffin the Mule\" aired on the CBeebies channel in Autumn 2005.\n\nThe original mule puppet was created in 1933 by Punch and Judy puppet maker Fred Tickner for husband-and-wife puppeteers Jan Bussell (1909-1984) and Ann Hogarth to form part of a puppet circus for the Hogarth Puppet Theatre. The act was soon put away, and the puppet was not taken out again until 1946, when Bussell and Hogarth were working with presenter Annette Mills. She named the puppet mule \"Muffin\", and it first appeared on television in an edition of \"For the Children\" broadcast on 20 October 1946.\nThe character proved popular, and ran on BBC television until 1955 when the BBC decided to discontinue the show after Annette Mills' death. Muffin reappeared on BBC television on 27 January 1957 with Jan Bussell as his companion.\n\nTypically, Muffin danced on top of a piano as Mills played it. Muffin the Mule was supported by a host of other puppet characters who appeared occasionally. A separate series of fifteen-minute episodes, \"Muffin the Mule\", was broadcast from 1952, with his signature tune \"\"We want Muffin\"\". Muffin became a television star, and a wide range of spin-off merchandise was made using the Muffin character, including books, records, games and toys. Muffin also was made into one of the first ever licensed kiddie rides. A die-cast movable puppet was produced by Lesney Products, \"the first toy to be marketed under licence as a result of a successful TV appearances.\"\n\nIn the early 1950s, a Fleetway weekly magazine, \"Woman's Illustrated\", featured on its children's page (Gnomes Club) stories about Muffin the Mule and/or his friends. Some were written by Annette Mills and illustrated by Molly Blake, Annette's daughter, such as \"Muffin meets the Rear Light\" in 1953; others did not state who the illustrator was, such as in 1953 \"Muffin's Good Deed\" by Annette Mills, and many stories were written and illustrated only by Molly Blake such as \"Willie Disappears\" (a Muffin story) on 20 August 1955.\n\nBussell and Hogarth, and later their daughter Sally McNally (1936–2004), continued to use Muffin in their own shows. Surviving original episodes are available on DVD. Archive footage of the original series was shown on a television set in the 2006 \"Doctor Who\" story \"The Idiot's Lantern\".\n\nA book containing some of the stories was published in the Soviet Union in the year 1958. At least 3 cartoons based on it were made in 1974 and 1975. These cartoons and the book make Muffin a donkey rather than a mule.\n\nThe rights to \"Muffin The Mule\" were bought by Maverick Entertainment Plc in 2003, and a new 27-part animated version of \"Muffin The Mule\" was shown on CBeebies between September 2005 and July 2010. The new series was also translated into Welsh as \"Myffin y Mul\" and broadcast in Wales on the S4C channel.\n\n\n1. Wish Upon A Star - Despite stargazing one cool Winter's night with Muffin the Mule and Monty the mischievous monkey making a star out of silver paper and cardboard as well as Peregrine the penguin building a telescope to study the stars and then seeing an alien that looks just like Willie the Worm, Louise the lamb soon learns that all real wishes should always be kept secret.\n\n2. The Party - When Louise the Lamb decides to organise a party in her garden one late Spring day in Muffinham, she invites everyone in the village, including Grace the Giraffe, who receives a gramophone from Postman Kangaroo. However, when Muffin agrees to help organize it for her and make preparations, Monty the Monkey overhears and, after being given the job of delivering the invitations to everyone in Muffinham, he becomes too curious and opens all 6 invitations whilst delivering them, causing him to disorganize them by mistake. In the end, after Monty eventually apologises to all the other animals for (accidentally) mixing up all the invites, Morris and Doris the mice and the other Muffinham residents do the jobs that they were meant to do in the first place, allowing the party to take place without chaos.\n\n3. Muffin's Day Off - It is a sunny Spring day in Muffinham and Muffin the Mule is looking forward to a relaxing picnic. Unfortunately, the other residents of Muffinham need Muffin to help solve their problems. Monty the Monkey cannot cross the river, Peregrine the Penguin has lost his reading glasses, Morris and Doris the field mice cannot decide whether to have red or pink roses by their front door, and Grace the Giraffe's hooves are purple. Muffin the Mule comes to the rescue before sharing his picnic with all his friends.\n\n4.

However, when Peter overhears Morris and Doris the mice talking about him moving away, he mistakenly thinks that they don't want him to live with them in their straw house any more and decides to find somewhere else in Muffinham to live. However, after visiting first Peregrine the Penguin, then Grace the giraffe, then Louise the Lamb, then Oswald the Ostrich and Willie the Worm and finally Monty the mischievous monkey, Peter the dog runs away and hides somewhere in the woods. In the end, it is Muffin the Mule who leads Peter to his new dog-kennel not far from Morris and Doris' garden and is relieved.\n\n5. Peregrine Helps Out - One chilly Autumn day in Muffinham, 4 of the village residents have problems. A seagull is building a nest on Grace the Giraffe's lighthouse roof, Willie the Worm is fed up of always moving slowly around the village, Louise the Lamb's drainpipe is broken and the bung for Morris and Doris' water butt is badly damaged. Peregrine the Penguin is annoyed that everyone always goes to Muffin the Mule with all their problems, but is delighted when he is finally asked for advice, despite him eventually making an aircraft for Willie the Worm, which unknowingly solves everyone's problems in an unusual way before finally crashing straight into the hole in Morris and Doris' water butt with a big bang, damaging the machine in the process.\n\n6. Moving House - Poor Oswald the Ostrich is desperate to fly and Peregrine's flipper invention gets him up in the air quicker than a bullet. But he crash lands into Peter the dog's kennel without warning! Peregrine was only trying to help, but despite babysitting Peter in his igloo, his actions leave Muffin homeless too, when his multi-coloured caravan rolls down the hill along with him asleep on board, in spite Muffin himself suddenly forgetting clean about Morris and Doris' armchairs, which Morris and Doris tell Muffin about falling to bits.\n\n7. Whodunnit? - Things keep on mysteriously disappearing without a trace in Muffinham, Peregrine the Penguin's pen, Louise the Lamb's woolly hair-curlers, Morris the Mouse's spade, and even Willie the Worm himself. Unfortunately, it turns out that a thief trap that Peregrine the Penguin eventually decides to build isn't really needed, just because Muffin then tells Peregrine that there never really was a thief and that it was only Peter the dog who was trying to keep the things safe all along by just burying them underground.\n\n8. Oswald's Garden Party - Oswald the Ostrich plans a bumper garden party for all his friends in Muffinham and wants to grow everyone's favourite food. Unfortunately, his big, clumsy feet accidentally squash all the seeds and plants. Willie the worm does his best to help out, and, along with his other worm friends, he comes up with a good solution - soft, crumbly compost.\n\n9. Oswald's Big Egg - It's a warm Spring day in Muffinham, but Monty the Monkey is desperate for someone in Muffinham to bake him a real cake, despite him being asked by Willie the Worm to scare away some crows which are attacking Oswald's garden.\n\n10. Muffin's Photo Shoot - Muffin the Mule decides to take some pictures of all of his friends, in spite of Grace the Giraffe taking a quick shower to be able to look perfect for the special occasion and Louise the Lamb wanting Grace's sparkly necklace which she unfortunately loses, but Peregrine the Penguin eventually finds it trapped inside an old leaf-blowing machine, along with several fallen tree leaves, which he kindly lends to Morris and Doris, despite eventually trying unsuccessfully to empty it when it finally becomes full of dead tree leaves.\n\n11. Muffin's Mules United - Muffin the Mule keeps fit by skipping, and everyone in Muffinham village wants to know how they can join in and get fit too. Team sports is the answer, so Muffin starts his own football team, \"Muffin's Mules United\". During their first-ever training session, however, Muffin and his friends realise that they don't have a goal-keeper, so they try to persuade the fitness-shy Grace the giraffe to go between the goal-posts - but she is just not that keen on doing anything too strenuous. However, when Peter the Dog runs off the pitch, Grace the giraffe goes to get him back, and when she finally does - she's Muffin's football team's star player, and all is well.\n\n12. Apple Pie Order - It is a cool Autumn day in Muffinham, and Monty the monkey is mischievously stealing some apples from Morris the Mouse's trees. Muffin and Morris the mouse come up with ghostly plans to catch the thief, despite Louise planning to go to Grace the Giraffe's lighthouse for tea and having to look her best. Doris the mouse, on the other hand, wants to make some home-made apple pies, which she eventually does.\n\n13. Muffin's Harvest Home - It is the Muffinham Harvest Home Supper, and everyone in the village is busy cooking. Muffin the Mule is harvesting his oats, Grace the Giraffe is making toffee apples, Oswald the Ostrich and Willie the Worm are making deliveries and Louise the Lamb is making carrot cake. Doris the mouse has trouble making spiced apple jellies for Peter and the other residents of the village, as Monty the monkey steals her bright pink jelly bag without warning and gives it to Muffin in mistake for a hay net, to which Muffin can hang up in his caravan.\n\n14. If the Cap Fits - It is a windy day in Muffinham and while Muffin the Mule is galloping to Louise the Lamb's rescue, a sudden gust of wind blows his thinking cap away without him noticing. It is a disaster! How can Muffin solve any problems without his hat? While Muffin worries about what to do, Peregrine the Penguin, Monty the Monkey, Oswald the ostrich, Willie the worm and most of all Louise the lamb all set out to make him a new thinking cap. In the end, it is Morris the mouse who comes up trumps and returns the thinking cap (which he finds on the head of a scarecrow that he built the day before) to its rightful owner, Muffin, following a sunhat fight with Doris.\n\n15. Louise Loses Her Top - Louise the lamb feels horrified when she wakes up one morning to find that Monty the monkey has stolen her woollen roof, along with some oatmeal biscuits that she had made for Muffin the mule the day before, following a brief chat with Peregrine the penguin. Muffin and the gang are all keen to help, as Louise the lamb has been so kind to them. With some help from some scaffolding and Grace the giraffe, Louise's knitted house comes back to life, despite Monty the monkey not being able to knit unaided.\n\n16. Creepy Crawly - Louise the lamb and Grace the giraffe have a problem with a spider and a fly. Nonetheless, Muffin the mule and Morris the mouse eventually deal with the creepy crawlies using a glass jar, despite Morris needing some help with picking some newly-grown raspberries from a cropper-grass-breeze that he grew the previous day with Doris the Mouse's help.\n\n17. Magnetic Muffin - Muffin the mule saves the day when he finds some treasure under the sea, along with a special-but-precious necklace, which Grace the giraffe loses during a picnic and a walk along Muffinham Beach with Louise the lamb.\n\n18. Jurassic Farce - When Morris the Mouse digs up some old bones, he realises that he's found the remains of a dinosaur, so he enlists the help of Peregrine the Penguin, Muffin the Mule and the rest of their friends to rebuild it. During a game of hide and seek with Willie the Worm, however, Oswald the Ostrich stumbles across the model and thinks that he has seen a monster. He gathers the troops together in order to help him battle it, but before they can tell him what it really is, he has charged into it and sent it crashing. Peregrine the Penguin is not pleased. Eventually, when everyone in Muffinham helps Morris to rebuild the dinosaur, including Grace the giraffe, the animals themselves realise that one dinosaur bone is missing, but even Muffin does not know where the dinosaur bone itself has gone to.\n\n19. Oswald's Sandpit - It is a hot Summer's day in Muffinham and Oswald the Ostrich has nearly run out of sand in his sandpit, much to Morris and Doris' dismay. Oswald keeps banging the end of his beak on the sandpits base, much to Willie the Worm's frustration. Whilst reading a magazine and watching Louise the Lamb sit in her deckchair in her garden and reading, Monty the Monkey wants a drink and some cake, but the sun is just too hot and strong. However, Muffin the Mule eventually comes to the rescue with a good solution and takes the other animals to Muffinham Beach, where, despite meeting Grace the giraffe there, they collect just enough sand (which they bring back to the village the following evening) to load into the sandpit, which, the following morning, makes Oswald the Ostrich feel better and sets Willie the Worm and the other Muffinham residents giggling like mad.\n\n20. Grow Up, Peter Pup - Peter the dog overhears Morris the mouse saying that he should grow up and move out, so, the following morning, after a bad night's sleep in his dog-kennel, he leaves home. However, Peter still misses his warm milk and his pink fluffy slipper. Luckily, Muffin the mule explains to him that growing up is difficult for everyone in the world.\n\n21. Penguin of the Year - Peregrine the Penguin gets too big for his boots when, one cool Autumn day in Muffinham, he is named Penguin Of The Year.\n\n22. Don't Gape, Oswald - Willie the Worm wants Oswald the Ostrich to just stop gaping, but will he ever do it?\n\n23. Make My Day - Muffin the Mule, Louise the Lamb and Peregrine the inventive Penguin are going to Muffinham Beach to fish for the day, so Grace the giraffe is relying on Monty the monkey to go shopping for her birthday party. On the way home, Monty finds a tall cherry tree and he fills his fuel tank up along with the tree's fruit. Then, he unknowingly leaves the party food on the path and lets Peter the dog eat it all. What will poor Muffin the Mule and the gang have to eat at Grace the giraffe's birthday barbecue party then?\n\n24. Crossed Wires - Louise the Lamb is feeling so annoyed that she called and called for Muffin the Mule, but he did not respond, because he was just too far away for her to be heard properly.\n\n25. Paint Your Wagon - Louise the Lamb goes round to Muffin the Mule's field for Breakfast, but she suddenly feels disgusted by the state of his old caravan, so she decides that it needs a new lick of paint.\n\n26. Unknown Episode Title - Muffin the Mule is accused of stealing a newly-baked apple tart by Morris and Doris the mice.\n\n27. Pain in the Belly - Poor Grace the giraffe has to look after Muffin the Mule for a few days or so, as nearly everyone else in Muffinham village has stomach aches, particularly Louise the lamb, everyone that is, except Peregrine the Penguin and Monty the Monkey.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1943983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943983", "title": "International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas", "text": "International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas\n\nThe International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) is an intergovernmental organization responsible for the management and conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. The organization was established in 1966, at a conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and operates in English, French and Spanish. The organisation has been strongly criticised by scientists for its repeated failure to conserve the sustainability of the tuna fishery by consistently supporting over-fishing – an internal review branded ICCAT's policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery a \"travesty of fisheries management\", and an \"international disgrace\". Conservationists often refer to ICCAT as \"The International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna\".\n\nHowever, in recent years the organization seems to be turning around. For the most iconic species within its management, the Eastern Bluefin Tuna, a very strict recovery plan was adopted. It is too early to judge its final outcome, but initial indications are encouraging. In general, ICCAT contracting parties seem to have agreed to steer the organization into a direction of relying on sound science, insisting on compliance and following a good governance model.\n\nTuna and tuna-like fishes are highly migratory, and stocks cross numerous international boundaries. ICCAT is involved in management of 30 species, including the Atlantic bluefin (\"Thunnus thynnus thynnus\"), yellowfin (\"T. albacares\"), albacore (\"T. alalunga\") and bigeye tuna (\"T. obesus\"); from the billfishes, swordfish (\"Xiphias gladius\"), white marlin (\"Tetrapturus albidus\"), blue marlin (\"Makaira nigricans\"), sailfish (\"Istiophorus albicans\"); mackerels such as spotted Spanish mackerel (\"Scomberomorus maculatus\") and king mackerel (\"S. cavalla\"); and, small tunas like skipjack tuna (\"Katsuwonus pelamis\").\n\nScientists participating in ICCAT carry out studies on biometry, fisheries ecology, and oceanography, focusing on the effects of fishing on tuna stock abundance. They also collect and analyse fisheries statistics which are relative to conditions the management of resources. ICCAT is also involved in work on data for other fish species that are caught during tuna fishing (\"bycatch\" - principally sharks) in the Atlantic and surrounding area, and which are not investigated by another international fishery organization.\n\nBased on scientific and other information, such as fishery statistics and stock assessments provided by members, each year the Commission decides on conservation and management measures aimed at maintaining target stocks at levels that permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes.\n\nICCAT is widely criticised by environmental bodies for having short-term policies that favour fisherman over the long-term conservation of the species. \n\nIn November 2008, ICCAT ignored the advice of their scientists that quotas for Atlantic bluefin tuna should not exceed 15,000 tonnes per year – which had been determined as the maximum sustainable yield – and instead set quotas at 22,000 tonnes. An independent review of ICCAT, commissioned by the organisation themselves, concluded that their policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery are a \"travesty of fisheries management\", and an \"international disgrace\". Dr Sergi Tudela, head of WWF Mediterranean's fisheries programme, said \"Today's outcome is a recipe for economic as well as biological bankruptcy with the European Union squarely to blame. ICCAT's string of successive failures leaves us little option now but to seek effective remedies through trade measures and extending the boycott of retailers, restaurants, chefs and consumers\".\n\nIn November 2009, ICCAT's scientific advisors announced that a total ban on international trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna was justified, based on the decline in the bluefin fishery population to less than 15% of its original size. However, later in the same month, ICCAT recommended catch quotas of 13,500 tonnes per year. This was met by sharp criticisms from environmental organisations, and prompted calls for alternative methods to regulate Atlantic bluefin fisheries, such as protection under CITES. Susan Lieberman, Director of International Policy for the Pew Environment Group said Since its inception, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas has been driven by short-term commercial fishing interests, not the conservation ethic implied by its name...ICCAT's actions and inactions highlight the need to take these issues to CITES—the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The ICCAT fisheries managers have shown scant interest in the long-term preservation of the key resources they are supposed to manage. It is now time to turn to other bodies to seek the needed protections that ICCAT has failed to provide.\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a statement with strongly worded criticism, saying that the new agreement was \"a marked improvement over the current rules, but it is insufficient to guarantee the long-term viability of either the fish or the fishery\".\n\nIn recent years ICCAT adopted a draconic recovery plan for Atlantic bluefin tuna in the eastern portion of their range, which led to the reduction of the total allowable catches from 27,500 in 2007 to 13,400 tons in 2014.\n\nApart from reduced total allowable catches, the recovery plan also introduced strict monitoring, reporting and control measures Over the years the plan seemed to produce results and recently earlier critics have welcome the plan and the action undertaken by ICCAT.\n\nIn November 2012 Susan Lieberman, international policy director of Pew Environment Group stated that \"It is encouraging that ICCAT listened to the recommendations of its own scientists and agreed to keep catch limits for bluefin tuna within their advice. This decision will give this depleted species a fighting chance to continue on the path to recovery after decades of overfishing and mismanagement\".\nIn November 2013 Dr Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean said: “WWF congratulates ICCAT member countries for sticking to science again this year regarding bluefin tuna quotas in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. This is a good sign for the credibility of ICCAT. However, failure to address countries’ failure to comply with rules remains an issue of grave concern”.\n"}

According to Allmusic journalist Steve Huey, \"best known for his 1960 R&B smash, 'Handy Man,' Jones sang in a smooth yet soulful falsetto modeled on the likes of Clyde McPhatter and Sam Cooke.\"\n\nJones was born in Birmingham, Alabama. His first job in the entertainment industry was as a tap dancer. He joined a doo-wop group named the Berliners in 1954. They later changed their name to Sparks of Rhythm. In 1955 Jones co-wrote \"Handy Man\", which was recorded by the Sparks of Rhythm in 1956 (after Jones left the group). After recording with other groups, Jones went solo and, in 1959, teamed up with Otis Blackwell who reworked \"Handy Man\" which Jones recorded on the MGM subsidiary Cub Records. When the flute player did not show up for the session, Blackwell famously whistled on the recording. \"Handy Man\", released in 1959, gave Jones his first US and UK hit single. It went to No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1960, and peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. It introduced a rock falsetto singing style to the British audience and later scored hits for Del Shannon and James Taylor. A few months later in 1960, Jones' recording of \"Good Timin'\" climbed to No. 1 in the UK and No. 3 in the US. Both \"Handy Man\" and \"Good Timin'\" were million sellers, earning Jones two gold discs.\n\nAlthough Jones had only the two million-selling Top 40 hits, he nevertheless kept active in the music industry as both a songwriter and recording artist and made personal appearances as he saw fit. Jones' subsequent career was low key, although it included three more UK chart entries in the following twelve months. Jones remained with Cub until 1962, and then recorded for the next decade for a variety of labels, including Bell, Parkway, Roulette, and Vee-Jay.\n\nDel Shannon cited Jones and Bill Kenny as influences on his falsetto style. Later singers who used falsetto included Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons, Lou Christie, Robert John, Jimmy Somerville, and Barry Gibb. Gibb cited Shannon, in turn, as an influence for his disco vocalizations with the Bee Gees. Jones released \"Grandma's Rock & Roll Party\" in the 1990s on CD, perhaps, in part due to his popularity in the UK Northern soul circles. It included new versions of \"Handy Man\" and \"Good Timin'\". Castle/Sanctuary released a double album called \"Good Timin': The Anthology\" in 2002.\n\nJimmy Jones died in Aberdeen, North Carolina, on August 2, 2012.\n"}

These two songs were played instead of the usual \"Child in Time\" to promote the new forthcoming album \"Machine Head\", released at the end of that month (March, 1972).\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" (the first ever live performance) and \"Maybe I'm a Leo\" were not included on the original double LP vinyl release in 1980, although \"Smoke on the Water\" was made available as a single release. The vinyl was housed in a gatefold-sleeve with photo-liners.\n\nThe track lengths on many of the 2001 reissues are incorrect.\n\nIn 2004, the contents of the second disc were remastered and released on SACD as \"Live on the BBC,\" on Audio Fidelity, with two bonus tracks (studio versions of \"Hush\" and \"River Deep Mountain High\").\n\nIn 2012, the contents of the second disc were remixed and released as \"In Concert '72\", with the original set list in its correct order for the first time. It was not quite the full recording, as some between-song chat was cut, presumably for timing purposes. No music was lost.\n\nAll songs written by Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord and Ian Paice except where indicated.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The species was first described by Johann Kaspar Füssli in 1775. It is distributed throughout Europe to the Urals, then east across the Palearctic to Siberia. It is also found in Sri Lanka.\n\nThis species has a wingspan of 35–45 mm, the female usually noticeably larger than the male. All parts of the adults are pure white, apart from a bright yellow tip to the abdomen (larger in the female) and a small black or brown tornal mark on the forewing of the male.\n\nWhite, and very like \"Euproctis chrysorrhoea\", but more pure silky white, anal wool and hairs at the apex of the abdomen of the female golden yellow. Not rarely, especially in the male sex, varieties occur with small dark spots on the forewing: \"auriflua\" [Esper, 1785] has three spots at the inner angle, forming an oblique transverse row, and one spot in the basal area near the hindmargin; \"nyctea\" Gr.-Grsh. has only one spot at the inner angle as well as one in the basal area like \"auriflua\"; \"trimaculata\" ab. nov. [Strand] is like nyctea. but has another spot on the costal margin opposite the subbasal inner marginal spot, while \"quadrimaculata\" ab. nov. [Strand] has a fourth subapical spot. The two last-named forms are from eastern Asia, where spotted specimens of this species seem on the whole to be commoner than in Europe \n\nIt flies at night in July and August and is attracted to light, especially the males.\n\nLarva black, with sparse black grey hairs, a brick-red divided longitudinal dorsal stripe, white lateral stripes and black head, segment 1 black streaked with yellow, the tubercles on segments 4 and 11 also black. It usually feeds on trees and shrubs such as alder, apple, birch, blackcurrant, blackthorn, cherry, chestnut, hawthorn, oak, rowan and sallow. It has also been recorded on monkshood, which is a herbaceous plant. This species overwinters as a larva. The larvae disperse soon after emerging from the eggs, which are covered with the anal wool of the female, hibernate singly and pupate at the beginning of June. Pupa blackish brown in a whitish cocoon. It is common everywhere in the distribution area, but not in such numbers as the very similar \"Euproctis chrysorrhoea\", and not noxious. The moth comes to the light and when at rest folds the wings very steeply in roof-shape; when touched it feigns death, lying on its side with the wings closed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the company responsible for Tiger Balm branded liniment (ointment). Its brands also included Kwan Loong and it also owns and operates weekend and leisure time destinations such as oceanariums.\n\nThe Haw Par Group owns two oceanariums: the now defunct Underwater World oceanarium attraction at Sentosa, Singapore, and Underwater World Pattaya in Thailand.\n\nThe predecessor of Haw Par Corporation, Eng Aun Tong, was founded by Aw Chu Kin, father of Aw Boon Haw and Boon Par brothers. Eng Aun Tong was then relocated to Singapore and expanded its branch to many Chinese communities in Asia. Aw Boon Haw also built Haw Par Villas in Hong Kong, Singapore and in Yongding District, Longyan, China. A private company, Haw Par Brothers (Private) Limited was incorporated in 1932 as a holding company for a vast majority of the family assets.\n\nAfter the death of Boon Par in 1944 and Boon Haw in 1954, the Haw Par Brothers (Private) Limited was owned by the descendant of the two brothers. However, companies such as Sin Poh Amalgamated (Hong Kong) (incorporated in 1951) and the publisher of \"Hong Kong Tiger Standard\" (incorporated in 1949) were owned by Aw family directly especially Sally Aw and Aw Toke Tone, son of Aw Hoe. Aw Hoe, adopted son of Aw Boon Haw, helped his father to establish \"Sing Tao Daily\" and \"Hong Kong Tiger Standard\", died in a plane crash in 1951. According to Gren Manuel, a reporter of \"South China Morning Post\", citing Aw Boon Haw's will filed in Hong Kong Public Record Office, Sally Aw and her adopted mother Tan Kim-kee () would inherited Aw Boon Haw's assets, and requesting them to use them in whole or part for charitable and/or benevolent and/or philanthropic purpose, while other sons and daughters of Aw Boon Haw, either received cash as heritage in 1954, or already received some of the shares of the companies such as Sin Poh Amalgamated (Hong Kong) and The Tiger Standard Limited at the incorporation of the companies. Sally Aw's elder (adopted) brother, Aw Swan, was renounced by Aw Boon Haw as son in 1952. Filing in Hong Kong Company Registries shown Sally inherited all the shares (220 out of 500 shares) of The Tiger Standard Limited that was owned by Aw Boon Haw, with the rest were owned by other member of Aw family as well as still under the name of late Aw Hoe (150 out of 500 shares) in early 1970s.\n\nAt the same time that Haw Par Brothers (Private) Limited made an open invitation to sell the Tiger Balm Garden of Hong Kong, Sally Aw and her mother Tan Kim-kee also sued Haw Par Brothers (Private) in order to reclaim deposits allegedly made by them in the company in 1961. The lawsuit was dismissed in 1962. Sally Aw also made another petition to wind up the company in 1961. Sally Aw withdrew the petition in the same year, after the barrister of Haw Par Brothers (Private) presented evidence on reclaiming Hong Kong Eng Aun Tong and its factory, which Sally Aw alleged that Hong Kong Eng Aun Tong (Limited) and another entity () were not the same and only the former was belongs to Haw Par Brothers (Private), with the rest was Aw Boon Haw's personal heritage. Sally Aw also sued Haw Par Brothers (Private) in 1959. In 1962, Aw It Haw, younger (half) brother of Sally, was instated as the director of Hong Kong Tiger Balm Eng Aun Tong Pharmaceutical. The lawsuit of the heritage of Aw Boon Haw was finally settled in 1967 by Sally Aw paying the company S$1.75 million. However, just 2 years after the settlement of the ownership of the heritage, some of the Aw family decided to sell the assets to the public by initial public offering.\n\nHaw Par Brothers International Limited was incorporated on 18 July 1969 by the Aw family (descendant of the late Aw Boon Haw and Boon Par brothers), in order to list most of the assets of Haw Par Brothers (Private) Limited on the Stock Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore. The assets included the brand Eng Aun Tong and Tiger Balm for liniment products, Sin Poh (Star News) Amalgamated that publishes newspaper in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand. The company also owned an equity investment in Chung Khiaw Bank (), as well as a lease contract that signed between Haw Par Brothers International and Haw Par Brothers (Private), to use the Tiger Balm Gardens in Hong Kong and Singapore that were owned by the latter. The shares started to trade in the exchange in November 1969.\n\nThe listed company made a major disinvestment in 1970, selling Hong Kong Eng Aun Tong building located in Wan Chai Road for HK$2.8 million, in order to raise fund the Hong Kong subsidiary for other investment. Nevertheless, the actual price was disputed, as the buyer told the press in Hong Kong another figure.\n\nHowever, a year after IPO, Aw family sold the controlling stake of the family to Slater Walker, At the same time Sin Poh (Star News) Amalgamated was privatized by Aw Cheng Chye (), eldest son of the late Aw Boon Par. Aw Cheng Chye also bought back some of the shares from Slater Walker. Haw Par Brothers International also sold 49.8% stake of Chung Khiaw Bank to United Overseas Bank for S$22 million. Aw Cheng Chye was also re-elected as the chairman of Haw Par Brothers International despite the takeover. After the sudden death of Aw Cheng Chye during a trip in Santiago de Chile in August 1971, as well as re-election of the board of directors, it was reported that the listed company was chaired by Richard Tarling while Haw Par Brothers (Private) Limited was chaired by Aw It Haw (), the fourth and the first biological son of the late Aw Boon Haw.\n\nAw Kow (), the eldest (adopted) son of the late Aw Boon Haw, who resigned as the director of Sin Poh (Star News) Amalgamated and the managing director of \"Sin Chew Jit Poh\" in May 1971 due to his personal investment in \"Eastern Sun\", also sued Haw Par Brothers (Private) Limited in 1972 for blocking him to read its accounts and financial statements, claiming under the late Aw Cheng Chye, the company allowed personal spending of Aw Cheng Chye, was invoiced by the company itself. The lawsuit was settled in 1977, in favour Aw Kow.\n\nIn the autobiography \"Escape from Paradise\" by John & May Chu Harding, they also claimed that Aw Cheng Chye's decision to make Haw Par Brothers International public, was against the wish of the part of the Aw family. May Chu Harding, \"née\" Lee, was the great-granddaughter of Aw Boon Par, or granddaughter of Lee Chee Shan and Aw Cheng Hu. Lee Chee Shan was the president of Chung Khiaw Bank in 1971.\n\nUnder Aw Cheng Chye as chairman, Haw Par Brothers (Private) also attempted to sell Tiger Balm Garden of Hong Kong in 1961; the last piece of the garden was sold to Cheung Kong in 1998 and the main building of the mansion was donated to the Hong Kong Government.\n\nAfter Haw Par Brothers International was taken over by Slater Walker in June 1971, the new owner changed Haw Par Brothers International from a family-held business into a true business enterprise. Slater Walker also sold 20% stake of Haw Par Brothers International to Slater Walker's associate company Australian Industrial and Mining Corporation (Austim) in November 1971, as well as a second listing of Haw Par Brothers International on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and in the London Stock Exchange. Austim sold 55% stake of Motor and General Investment Underwriters Holdings Singapore to Haw Par Brothers International in August 1971. It was announced that the Holdings would purchase a Singapore construction company Scott & English () in September 1971.\n\nAfter the resignation of both Lee Aik Sim (Lee Santipongchai, ), and his wife Aw Cheng Sin (Suri Santipongchai, ), the daughter of late Aw Boon Par as the directors of Haw Par Brothers (Thailand) in January 1972, the subsidiary was sold in the same month to Jack Chia (). Jack Chia and Haw Par Brothers International also formed a joint venture, which the joint venture have the rights to use \"Tiger Balm\" brand. In March 1972 Haw Par Brothers International acquired fellow pharmaceutical company in Chinese medicines, Hong Kong listed company Kwan Loong & Co., However, Slater Walker turned the Hong Kong company into an investment vehicle in financial market, which was known as Slater Walker Securities (Hong Kong).\n\nIn April 1972, Haw Par Brothers International made a strategic investment on a property on 302 Orchard Road.\n\nIn 1973 the company expanded to Japan as well as bought 29% stake of a London-listed company London Tin Corporation. Haw Par Brothers International financed the deal by a proposed recapitalization. The stake was sold in 1976 and the sub-holding company that Haw Par Brothers International established in London, was sold in 1982.\n\nThe parent company Slater Walker was collapsed after the secondary banking crisis of 1973–75; the company was bailed out by the Bank of England. For Haw Par Brothers International itself, financial irregularities were exposed, for which former chairman Tarling was jailed for 6 months in 1979. The company was then acquired by Singapore-local Wee Cho Yaw.\n\nKwan Loong () originated from a different listed company of the same name (Kwan Loong & Co., ), which was acquired in March 1972. It produces medicated oil, specifically , literally \"oil that expels headaches.\"\n"}

Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the French and Indian War, a gravity railroad (mechanized tramway) (Montresor's Tramway) was built by British military engineers up the steep riverside terrain near the Niagara River waterfall's escarpment at the Niagara Portage (which the local Senecas called \"\"Crawl on All Fours.\"\") in Lewiston, New York.\n\nDuring this period, Americans watched closely the development of railways in the United Kingdom. The main competition came from canals, many of which were in operation under state ownership, and from privately owned steamboats plying the nation's vast river system. In 1829, Massachusetts prepared an elaborate plan. Government support, most especially the detailing of officers from the Army Corps of Engineers – the nation's only repository of civil engineering expertise – was crucial in assisting private enterprise in building nearly all the country's railroads. Army Engineer officers surveyed and selected routes, planned, designed, and constructed rights-of-way, track, and structures, and introduced the Army's system of reports and accountability to the railroad companies. More than one in ten of the 1,058 graduates from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point between 1802 and 1866 became corporate presidents, chief engineers, treasurers, superintendents and general managers of railroad companies. Among the Army officers who thus assisted the building and managing of the first American railroads were Stephen Harriman Long, George Washington Whistler, and Herman Haupt.\n\nState governments granted charters that created the business corporation and gave a limited right of eminent domain, allowing the railroad to buy needed land, even if the owner objected.\n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) was chartered in 1827 to build a steam railroad west from Baltimore, Maryland, to a point on the Ohio River. It began scheduled freight service over its first section on May 24, 1830. The first railroad to carry passengers, and, by accident, the first tourist railroad, began operating 1827. It was the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, initially a gravity road feeding anthracite coal downhill to the Lehigh Canal and using mule-power to return nine miles up the mountain; but, by the summer of 1829, as documented by newspapers, it regularly carried passengers. Later renamed the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad, it added a steam powered cable-return track for true two-way operation by 1843, and ran as a common carrier and tourist road from the 1890s to 1937. Lasting 111 years, the SH&MC is described by some to be the world's first roller coaster.\n\nThe first purpose-built common carrier railroad in the northeast was the Mohawk & Hudson Railroad; incorporated in 1826, it began operating in August 1831. Soon, a second passenger line, the Saratoga & Schenectady Railroad, started service in June 1832.\nIn 1835 the B&O completed a branch from Baltimore southward to Washington, D.C. The Boston & Providence Railroad was incorporated in 1831 to build a railroad between Boston, Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Island; the road was completed in 1835 with the completion of the Canton Viaduct in Canton, Massachusetts.\n\nNumerous short lines were built, especially in the south, to provide connections to the river systems and the river boats common to the era. In Louisiana, the Pontchartrain Rail-Road, a route connecting the Mississippi River with Lake Pontchartrain at New Orleans was completed in 1831 and provided over a century of operation. Completed in 1830, the Tuscumbia, Courtland & Decatur Railroad became the first railroad constructed west of the Appalachian Mountains; it connected the two Alabama cities of Decatur and Tuscumbia.\n\nSoon, other roads that would themselves be purchased or merged into larger entities, formed. The Camden & Amboy Railroad (C&A), the first railroad built in New Jersey, completed its route between its namesake cities in 1834. The C&A ran successfully for decades connecting New York City to the Delaware valley, and would eventually become part of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nBy 1850, over of railroad lines had been built. The B&O's westward route reached the Ohio River in 1852, the first eastern seaboard railroad to do so. Railroad companies in the North and Midwest constructed networks that linked nearly every major city by 1860.\n\nThe First Transcontinental Railroad in the U.S. was built across North America in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the Pacific coast. Finished on May 10, 1869 at the Golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system. It achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific. However it was not the world's longest railroad, as the Canadian Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than of track by connecting Portland, Maine, and the three northern New England states with the Canadian Atlantic provinces, and west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nAuthorized by the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 and heavily backed by the federal government, the first transcontinental railroad was the culmination of a decades-long movement to build such a line and was one of the crowning achievements of the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, completed four years after his death. The building of the railroad required enormous feats of engineering and labor in the crossing of plains and high mountains by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and Central Pacific Railroad, the two federally chartered enterprises that built the line westward and eastward respectively. The building of the railroad was motivated in part to bind the Union together during the strife of the American Civil War. It substantially accelerated the populating of the West by homesteaders, leading to rapid cultivation of new farm lands. The Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroad combined operations in 1870 and formally merged in 1885; the Union Pacific originally bought the Southern Pacific in 1901 and was forced to divest it in 1913, but took it over again in 1996.\n\nMuch of the original roadbed is still in use today and owned by UP, which is descended from both of the original railroads.\n\nMany Canadian and U.S. railroads originally used various broad gauges, but most were converted to by 1886, when the conversion of much of the southern rail network from gauge took place. This and the standardization of couplings and air brakes enabled the pooling and interchange of locomotives and rolling stock.\n\nThe railroad had its largest impact on the American transportation system during the second half of the 19th century. The standard historical interpretation holds that the railroads were central to the development of a national market in the United States and served as a model of how to organize, finance and manage a large corporation.\n\nIn 1944, American economic historian Leland Jenks (having conducted an analysis based on Joseph Schumpeter's theory of innovation) similarly claims that railroads had a direct impact on the growth of the United States' real income and an indirect impact on its economic expansion. In his Rostovian Take-off Thesis, Walt W. Rostow systematically developed the Jenks model that railroads were crucial to American economic growth. According to Rostow, railroads were responsible for the \"take-off\" of American industrialization in the period of 1843–1860. This \"take-off\" in economic growth occurred because the railroad helped to decrease transportation costs, transport new products and goods to commercial markets, and generally widen the market. Furthermore, the development of railroads stimulated the growth of the modern coal, iron, and engineering industries, all of which were essential for wider economic growth. According to Rostow's Take-off Thesis, railroads generated new investment, which simultaneously helped develop financial markets in the United States.\n\nContemporary American economic historians have challenged this conventional view. The respective findings of Robert Fogel and Albert Fishlow do not support Rostow's claim that railroads stimulated widespread industrialization by increasing demand for coal, iron, and machinery. Drawing upon historical data, Robert Fogel found that the impact of railroads on the iron and steel industries was minimal: from 1840 to 1860, railroad production used less than five percent of the total pig iron produced. In addition, Fogel argues, only six percent of total coal production from 1840 to 1860 was consumed by railroads through consumption of iron products. Like Fogel, Fishlow showed that most railroads used very little coal during this time period because they were able to burn wood instead. Fishlow also found that iron used by railroads was only 20% of net consumption in the 1850s.\n\nFogel concludes that railroads were important but not \"essential\" to late 19th century growth in the U.S. in the sense that a possible alternative existed even if it was never tried. Fogel focuses on the \"social saving\" created by railroads, which he defines as the difference between the actual level of national income in 1890 and the theoretical level of national income if transportation somehow existed in the most efficient way possible to the absence of the railroad. He found that without the railroad, America's gross national product (GNP) would have been 7.2% less in 1890. While the largest contribution to GNP growth made by any single innovation before 1900, this percentage only represents 2–3 years of GNP growth.\n\nFogel makes several key assumptions and decisions in his analysis. First, his calculations comprise transportation between the primary markets of the Midwest and the secondary markets of the East and South (interregional) and transportation between cities and rural areas (intraregional). Second, he chooses to focus on the shipment of four agricultural commodities: wheat, corn, beef, and pork. Third, Fogel's social saving calculation accounts for costs not included in water rates (which include the cargo losses in transit, transshipment costs, extra wagon haulage, time lost because of slower speed and because canals froze in the winter, and capital costs). One criticism of Fogel's analysis is that it does not account for the externalities or \"spill-over\" effects of the railroads, which (if included) may have increased his estimate for social savings [definition needed]. Railroads provided much of the demand for the technological advances in a number of areas, including heat dynamics, combustion engineering, thermodynamics, metallurgy, civil engineering, machining, and metal fabrication. Furthermore, Fogel does not discuss the role railroads played in the development of the financial system or in attracting foreign capital, which otherwise might not have been available.\n\nFishlow estimates that the railroad's social savings—or what he terms \"direct benefits\"—were higher than those calculated by Fogel. Fishlow's research may indicate that the development of railroads significantly influenced real income in the United States. Instead of Fogel's term \"social saving\", Fishlow uses the term \"direct benefits\" to describe the difference between the actual level of national income in 1859 and the theoretical level of income using the least expensive, but existing alternative means. Fishlow calculated the social savings in 1859 at 4 percent of GNP and in 1890 at 15 percent of GNP—higher than Fogel's estimate of 7.2% in 1890.\n\nIndustrialists such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and Jay Gould became wealthy through railroad ownerships, as large railroad companies such as the New York Central, Grand Trunk Railway and the Southern Pacific spanned several states. In response to monopolistic practices (such as price fixing) and other excesses of some railroads and their owners, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887. The ICC indirectly controlled the business activities of the railroads through issuance of extensive regulations. Congress also enacted antitrust legislation to prevent railroad monopolies, beginning with the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890.\n\nThe principal mainline railroads concentrated their efforts on moving freight and passengers over long distances. But many had suburban services near large cities, which might also be served by Streetcar and Interurban lines. The Interurban was an almost uniquely North American concept which relied almost exclusively on passenger traffic for revenue. Unable to survive the Great Depression, the failure of most Interurbans by that time left many cities without suburban passenger railroads, although the largest cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia continued to have suburban service. The major railroads passenger flagship services included multi-day journeys on luxury trains resembling hotels, which were unable to compete with airlines in the 1950s. Rural communities were served by slow trains no more than twice a day. They survived until the 1960s because the same train hauled the Railway Post Office cars, paid for by the US Post Office. RPOs were withdrawn when mail sorting was mechanized.\n\nAs early as the 1930s, automobile travel had begun to cut into the rail passenger market, somewhat reducing economies of scale, but it was the development of the Interstate Highway System and of commercial aviation in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as increasingly restrictive regulation, that dealt the most damaging blows to rail transportation, both passenger and freight. General Motors and other were convicted of running the streetcar industry into the ground purposefully in what is referred to as the Great American Streetcar Scandal. There was little point in operating passenger trains to advertise freight service when those who made decisions about freight shipping traveled by car and by air, and when the railroads' chief competitors for that market were interstate trucking companies.\n\nSoon, the only things keeping most passenger trains running were legal obligations. Meanwhile, companies who were interested in using railroads for profitable freight traffic were looking for ways to get out of those legal obligations, and it looked like intercity passenger rail service would soon become extinct in the United States beyond a few highly populated corridors. The final blow for passenger trains in the U.S. came with the loss of railroad post offices in the 1960s. On May 1, 1971, the federally funded Amtrak took over (with a few exceptions) all intercity passenger rail service in the continental United States. The Rio Grande, with its Denver-Ogden \"Rio Grande Zephyr\" and the Southern with its Washington, D.C.–New Orleans \"Southern Crescent\" chose to stay out of Amtrak, and the Rock Island, with two intrastate Illinois trains, was too far gone to be included into Amtrak.\n\nFreight transportation continued to labor under regulations developed when rail transport had a monopoly on intercity traffic, and railroads only competed with one another. An entire generation of rail managers had been trained to operate under this regulatory regime. Labor unions and their work rules were likewise a formidable barrier to change. Overregulation, management and unions formed an \"iron triangle\" of stagnation, frustrating the efforts of leaders such as the New York Central's . In particular, the dense rail network in the Northeastern U.S. was in need of radical pruning and consolidation. A spectacularly unsuccessful beginning was the 1968 formation and subsequent bankruptcy of the Penn Central, barely two years later.\n\nHistorically, on routes where a single railroad has had an undisputed monopoly, passenger service was as spartan and as expensive as the market and ICC regulation would bear, since such railroads had no need to advertise their freight services. However, on routes where two or three railroads were in direct competition with each other for freight business, such railroads would spare no expense to make their passenger trains as fast, luxurious, and affordable as possible, as it was considered to be the most effective way of advertising their profitable freight services.\n\nThe National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) was formed in 1967 to lobby for the continuation of passenger trains. Its lobbying efforts were hampered somewhat by Democratic opposition to any sort of rail subsidies to the privately owned railroads, and Republican opposition to nationalization of the railroad industry. The proponents were aided by the fact that few in the federal government wanted to be held responsible for the seemingly inevitable extinction of the passenger train, which most regarded as tantamount to political suicide. The urgent need to solve the passenger train disaster was heightened by the bankruptcy filing of the Penn Central, the dominant railroad in the Northeast U.S., on June 21, 1970.\n\nUnder the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (NRPC) to subsidize and oversee the operation of intercity passenger trains. The Act provided that\n\nThe original working brand name for NRPC was \"Railpax\", which eventually became \"Amtrak\". At the time, many Washington insiders viewed the corporation as a face-saving way to give passenger trains the one \"last hurrah\" demanded by the public, but expected that the NRPC would quietly disappear in a few years as public interest waned. However, while Amtrak's political and financial support have often been shaky, popular and political support for Amtrak has allowed it to survive into the 21st century.\n\nSimilarly, to preserve a declining freight rail industry, Congress passed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (sometimes called the \"3R Act\"). The act was an attempt to salvage viable freight operations from the bankrupt Penn Central and other lines in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwestern regions. The law created the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), a government-owned corporation, which began operations in 1976. Another law, the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (the \"4R Act\"), provided more specifics for the Conrail acquisitions and set the stage for more comprehensive deregulation of the railroad industry. Portions of the Penn Central, Erie Lackawanna, Reading Railroad, Ann Arbor Railroad, Central Railroad of New Jersey, Lehigh Valley, and Lehigh and Hudson River were merged into Conrail.\n\nThe freight industry continued its decline until Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, which largely deregulated the rail industry. Since then, U.S. freight railroads have reorganized, discontinued their lightly used routes and returned to profitability.\n\nFreight railroads play an important role in the U.S. economy, especially for moving imports and exports using containers, and for shipments of coal and oil. According to the British news magazine \"The Economist,\" \"They are universally recognised in the industry as the best in the world.\" Productivity rose 172% between 1981 and 2000, while rates decreased by 55% (after accounting for inflation). Rail's share of the American freight market rose to 43%, the highest for any rich country.\n\nU.S. railroads still play a major role in the nation's freight shipping. They carried 750 billion ton-miles by 1975 which doubled to 1.5 trillion ton-miles in 2005. In the 1950s, the U.S. and Europe moved roughly the same percentage of freight by rail; by 2000, the share of U.S. rail freight was 38% while in Europe only 8% of freight traveled by rail. In 2000, while U.S. trains moved 2,390 billion ton-kilometers of freight, the 15-nation European Union moved only 304 billion ton-kilometers of freight. In terms of ton-miles, railroads annually move more than 25% of the United States' freight and connect businesses with each other across the country and with markets overseas. In 2018, US rail freight had a transport energy efficiency of 473 miles per gallon of fuel per ton of freight.\n\nU.S. freight railroads are separated into three classes, set by the Surface Transportation Board, based on annual revenues:\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. moved more oil out of North Dakota by rail than by the Trans-Alaska pipeline. This trend—tenfold in two years and 40-fold in five years—is forecast to increase.\n\nThere are four different classes of freight railroads: Class I, regional, local line haul, and switching & terminal. Class I railroads are defined as those with revenue of at least $346.8 million in 2006. They comprise just one percent of the number of freight railroads, but account for 67 percent of the industry's mileage, 90 percent of its employees, and 93 percent of its freight revenue.\n\nA regional railroad is a line haul railroad with at least and/or revenue between $40 million and the Class I threshold. There were 33 regional railroads in 2006. Most have between 75 and 500 employees.\n\nLocal line haul railroads operate less than and earn less than $40 million per year (most earn less than $5 million per year). In 2006, there were 323 local line haul railroads. They generally perform point-to-point service over short distances.\n\nSwitching and terminal (S&T) carriers are railroads that primarily provide switching and/or terminal services, regardless of revenue. They perform pick up and delivery services within a certain area.\n\nU.S. freight railroads operate in a highly competitive marketplace. To compete effectively against each other and against other transportation providers, railroads must offer high-quality service at competitive rates. In 2011, within the U.S., railroads carried 39.9% of freight by ton-mile, followed by trucks (33.4%), oil pipelines (14.3%), barges (12%) and air (0.3%). However, railroads' revenue share has been slowly falling for decades, a reflection of the intensity of the competition they face and of the large rate reductions railroads have passed through to their customers over the years.\n\nNorth American railroads operated 1,471,736 freight cars and 31,875 locomotives, with 215,985 employees. They originated 39.53 million carloads (averaging 63 tons each) and generated $81.7 billion in freight revenue of present 2014. The average haul was 917 miles. The largest (Class 1) U.S. railroads carried 10.17 million intermodal containers and 1.72 million piggyback trailers. Intermodal traffic was 6.2% of tonnage originated and 12.6% of revenue. The largest commodities were coal, chemicals, farm products, nonmetallic minerals and intermodal. Other major commodities carried include lumber, automobiles, and waste materials. Coal alone was 43.3% of tonnage and 24.7% of revenue. Coal accounted for roughly half of U.S. electricity generation and was a major export. As natural gas became cheaper than coal, coal supplies dropped 11% in 2015 but coal rail freight dropped by up to 40%, allowing an increase in car transport by rail, some in tri-level railcars. US coal consumption dwindled from over 1,100 million tons in 2008 to 687 million tons in 2018.\n\nThe fastest growing rail traffic segment is currently intermodal. Intermodal is the movement of shipping containers or truck trailers by rail and at least one other mode of transportation, usually trucks or ocean-going vessels. Intermodal combines the door-to-door convenience of trucks with the long-haul economy of railroads. Rail intermodal has tripled in the last 25 years. It plays a critical role in making logistics far more efficient for retailers and others. The efficiency of intermodal provides the U.S. with a huge competitive advantage in the global economy. A major factor in making U.S. rail intermodal freight competitive is the use of double-stack rail transport, where shipping containers are loaded two-high on special freight cars, potential doubling the number of containers one train can carry, with corresponding reductions in operating costs.\n\nPrior to Amtrak's creation in 1970, intercity passenger rail service in the U.S. was provided by the same companies that provided freight service. When Amtrak was formed, in return for government permission to exit the passenger rail business, freight railroads donated passenger equipment to Amtrak and helped it get started with a capital infusion of some $200 million.\n\nThe vast majority of the 22,000 or so miles over which Amtrak operates are actually owned by freight railroads. By law, freight railroads must grant Amtrak access to their track upon request. In return, Amtrak pays fees to freight railroads to cover the incremental costs of Amtrak's use of freight railroad tracks.\n\nThe sole long-distance intercity passenger railroad in the continental U.S. is Amtrak, although Virgin Trains USA provides regional intercity service in Florida. Commuter rail systems exist in more than a dozen metropolitan areas, but these systems are not extensively interconnected, so commuter rail cannot be used alone to traverse the country. Commuter systems have been proposed in approximately two dozen other cities, but interplays between various local-government administrative bottlenecks and ripple effects from the 2007–2012 global financial crisis have generally pushed such projects farther and farther into the future, or have even sometimes mothballed them entirely. \n\nThe most culturally notable and physically evident exception to the general lack of significant passenger rail transport in the U.S. is the Northeast Corridor between Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, with significant branches in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The corridor handles frequent passenger service that is both Amtrak and commuter. New York City itself is noteworthy for high usage of passenger rail transport, both subway and commuter rail (Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, New Jersey Transit). The subway system is used by one third of all U.S. mass transit users. Chicago also sees high rail ridership, with a local elevated system, one of the world's last interurban lines, and fourth most-ridden commuter rail system in the United States: Metra. Other major cities with substantial rail infrastructure include Philadelphia's SEPTA, Boston's MBTA, and Washington, D.C.'s network of commuter rail and rapid transit. Denver, Colorado constructed a new electrified commuter rail system in the 2000s to compliment the city's light rail system. The commuter rail systems of San Diego and Los Angeles, Coaster and Metrolink, connect in Oceanside, California. The San Francisco Bay Area additionally hosts several local rail operators.\n\nPrivately run inter-city passenger rail operations have also been restarted since 2018 in south Florida, with additional routes under development. Virgin Trains USA is a higher-speed rail train, run by All Aboard Florida. It began service in January 2018 between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach; its service was extended to Miami in May 2018, with an extension to Orlando International Airport planned by 2022. Virgin Trains USA has also proposed a further extension of its service from Orlando to Tampa via Walt Disney World, and a high-speed rail service from Victorville, California to Las Vegas. In addition, the Texas Central Railway is currently developing plans for a proposed greenfield high-speed rail line using Japanese Shinkansen trains between Dallas and Houston, which is expected to begin construction in 2020 and open in early 2026.\n\nThe basic design of a passenger car was standardized by 1870. By 1900, the main car types were: baggage, coach, combine, diner, dome car, lounge, observation, private, Pullman, railroad post office (RPO) and sleeper.\n\nThe first passenger cars resembled stagecoaches. They were short, often less than long, tall and rode on a single pair of axles.\n\nAmerican mail cars first appeared in the 1860s and at first followed English design. They had a hook that would catch the mailbag in its crook.\n\nAs locomotive technology progressed in the mid-19th century, trains grew in length and weight. Passenger cars grew along with them, first getting longer with the addition of a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored a single pair of doors at one end of the car in the car's vestibule; compartmentized cars on American railroads featured a long hallway with doors from the hall to the compartments.\n\nOne possible reason for this difference in design principles between American and European carbuilding practice could be the average distance between stations on the two continents. While most European railroads connected towns and villages that were still very closely spaced, American railroads had to travel over much greater distances to reach their destinations. Building passenger cars with a long passageway through the length of the car allowed the passengers easy access to the restroom, among other things, on longer journeys.\n\nDining cars first appeared in the late 1870s and into the 1880s. Until this time, the common practice was to stop for meals at restaurants along the way (which led to the rise of Fred Harvey's chain of Harvey House restaurants in America). At first, the dining car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared.\n\nBy the 1920s, passenger cars on the larger standard gauge railroads were normally between long. The cars of this time were still quite ornate, many of them being built by experienced coach makers and skilled carpenters.\n\nWith the 1930s came the widespread use of stainless steel for car bodies. The typical passenger car was now much lighter than its \"heavyweight\" wood cousins of old. The new \"lightweight\" and streamlined cars carried passengers in speed and comfort to an extent that had not been experienced to date. Aluminum and Cor-ten were also used in lightweight car construction, but stainless steel was the preferred material for car bodies. It is not the lightest of materials, nor is it the least expensive, but stainless steel cars could be, and often were, left unpainted except for the car's reporting marks that were required by law.\n\nBy the end of the 1930s, railroads and car builders were debuting car body and interior styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes—that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with the single traveler in mind. The roomette featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveler to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old.\n\nNow that passenger cars were lighter, they were able to carry heavier loads, but the size of the average passenger load that rode in them didn't increase to match the cars' new capacities. The average passenger car couldn't get any wider or longer due to side clearances along the railroad lines, but they generally could get taller because they were still shorter than many freight cars and locomotives. As a result, the railroads soon began building and buying dome and bilevel cars to carry more passengers.\n\nCarbody styles have generally remained consistent since the middle of the 20th century. While new car types have not made much of an impact, the existing car types have been further enhanced with new technology.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, the passenger travel market declined in North America, though there was growth in commuter rail. The higher clearances in North America enabled bi-level commuter coaches that could hold more passengers. These cars started to become common in the United States in the 1960s.\n\nWhile intercity passenger rail travel declined in the United States during the 1950s, ridership continued to increase in Europe during that time. With the increase came newer technology on existing and new equipment. The Spanish company Talgo began experimenting in the 1940s with technology that would enable the axles to steer into a curve, allowing the train to move around the curve at a higher speed. The steering axles evolved into mechanisms that would also tilt the passenger car as it entered a curve to counter the centrifugal force experienced by the train, further increasing speeds on existing track. Today, tilting passenger trains are commonplace. Talgo's trains are used on some short and medium distance routes such as Amtrak Cascades from Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIn August 2016, the Department of Transportation approved the largest loan in the department's history, $2.45 billion to upgrade the passenger train service in the Northeast region. The $2.45 billion will be used to purchase 28 new train sets for the high-speed Acela train between Washington through Philadelphia, New York and into Boston. The money will also be used build new stations and platforms. The money will also be used to rehabilitate railroad tracks and upgrade four stations, including Washington's Union Station and Baltimore's Penn Station.\n\nEvery piece of railroad rolling stock operating in North American interchange service is required to carry a standardized set of reporting marks. The marks are made up of a two- to four-letter code identifying the owner of the equipment accompanied by an identification number and statistics on the equipment's capacity and tare (unloaded) weight. Marks whose codes end in X (such as TTGX) are used on equipment owned by entities that are not common carrier railroads themselves. Marks whose codes end in U are used on containers that are carried in intermodal transport, and marks whose codes end in Z are used on trailers that are carried in intermodal transport, per ISO standard 6346). Most freight cars carry automatic equipment identification RFID transponders.\n\nTypically, railroads operating in the United States reserve one- to four-digit identification numbers for powered equipment such as diesel locomotives and six-digit identification numbers for unpowered equipment. There is no hard and fast rule for how equipment is numbered; each railroad maintains its own numbering policy for its equipment.\n\n\n\nFederal regulation of railroads is mainly through the United States Department of Transportation, especially the Federal Railroad Administration which regulates safety, and the Surface Transportation Board which regulates rates, service, the construction, acquisition and abandonment of rail lines, carrier mergers and interchange of traffic among carriers.\n\nRailroads are also regulated by the individual states, for example through the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1944058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944058", "title": "Ute muster", "text": "Ute muster\n\nA ute muster is an Australian festival which brings together large numbers of utes and their owners. These events typically include competitions and other side events, occur annually, and normally last several days and are held in rural and regional areas of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThese events can be seen as a more rural version of the Summernats, a festival which promotes a wider range of car culture.\n\nThe Caboolture Urban Country Music Festival, which features a \"Beaut Ute\" competition, is a country music festival established in 2004.\n\nOften ute musters are combined with a larger festival such as a rodeo, agricultural show or music festival, and are usually sponsored by companies which are local to where the muster is being held.\n\nUte musters are often mis-represented as being attended by yobbos who just like to drink, this is no longer the case, but instead an outlet for enthusiastic ute owners to show off their pride and joy in their vehicles which are personalised with lights, stickers, bull bars, and various after-market add-ons. They are generally held to raise money for towns, charities and local causes, and have run in conjunction with agricultural shows or Bachelor and Spinster Balls which raise money for local charities.\n\nThe Deniliquin Ute Muster is the largest event of its kind in the world. It is a stand-alone event which began as a celebration of all things Australian and the Aussie icon of the ute, and has developed into a two-day festival, with live music concerts, ute driving competitions, the Australian National Circle Work Championships TM, show and shine arena, and bull ride.\n\nUte enthusiasts tend to have an obsession with bumper stickers, often covering the entire rear window of the ute with them. Accumulating the most different stickers is a sort of status symbol which is often the deciding factor in many of the \"Beaut Ute\" competitions (see below). Some of the popular stickers are Bundaberg Rum, Holden, Jim Beam, Ute Muster and the Conargo Pub.\n\nThe event itself involves a congregation of ute enthusiasts who enter their utes in a number of competitions, sometimes referred to as a \"Beaut Ute Competition\". Some of the typical categories are:\nOther categories are also included and run on the day these are called novelty categories and normally take a side step from the general categories to make a bit of fun to fill in the day.\nsome novelty categories include:\n\nMost of the ute muster events around Australia try to compete with each other by continually breaking new records of gathering the most vehicles in the one place.\n\nHowever, that mantle has been claimed by Deniliquin which previously held a small ute show as part of its annual Pastoral and Agricultural Show, but developed the idea into a tourist-attracting event. In 1999 a group of community-minded people got together with the idea of celebrating all things Australian, including the Aussie icon of the ute, to attract people to the agricultural town of Deniliquin, located in the southern Riverina region of New South Wales. In its first year, the event held a Guinness Book of Records count of \"the largest parade of legally registered utes in the world\", and each year new records are broken.\n\nIn 1999, 2839 drivers took part, establishing \"Deniliquin\" as the ute capital of the world. Since that time, the event has grown in popularity and each year breaks its existing world record. As of 2010, Deniliquin's current record stands at 8,152 utes, with over 25,000 attendees in a town that normally has a population of about 8000.\n\nThe Deniliquin Ute Muster also holds a record count for most number of people wearing blue singlets - in 2010 that Guinness Book of Records count stands at 3500 people.\n\nIn 2013, a new ute record of 9,736 was set and a new blue singlet record of 3,924 was counted.\n\nUte musters are often held to help raise funds for local charities, such as raising funds for local schools or hospitals. Often the ute musters are associated with local groups such as Apex or Rotary. They are seen as a good drawcard to bring in money from participants who are not members of the local community - so all money spent is extra money for the local community, whether it goes to the local charity, or just to the local economy.\n\nMusters are often held in conjunction with local agricultural shows. This will assists organisers in arranging advertising, insurance and other sponsorship. It can also assist in obtaining the cooperation of local emergency services such as police and ambulance, if the muster is one aspect of a larger, previously established local event.\n\nMost ute musters charge a relatively small fee for participants, allowing them to enter any category they are qualified for. Most participants would enter between five and ten categories, as this keeps the event proceeding. Many participants travel long distances to enter and prefer activities to be held in a short timeframe to allow them to join in other parts of the festival.\n\nWell organised events cater for camping. As this is a usual festival environment drawing participants from large distances in country areas there are limited opportunities for public transport. Both competitors and other participants often make extensive use of any bar facilities; in many events the bar provides a large portion of the funds raised. Well organised events provide for camping as often the most practical accommodation for all concerned.\n\nWhilst larger musters can annoy some locals, this is seen as the exception rather than the rule. Most musters attract between 20-100 utes, depending upon event advertising. Commonly, musters also have maximum numbers permitted to attend - this is often a requirement in obtaining event permits.\n\nEvent committees need to liaise carefully with local law enforcement. The muster held at Deniliquin is a good example of close relationships with NSW Police. Whilst the organisers recognise that some attendees can flout the law, this is seen as a minority and the event is able to proceed in a realistic environment. This achieves the event's goals of fundraising and ensures participants are able to enjoy the event.\n\n"}

He is best known for a 2001 paper in \"Nature\" on the flow of transgenes into wild maize populations, as an outspoken critic of the University of California's ties to the biotechnology industry, as well as a later dispute with the University over denial of tenure that Chapela argued was politically motivated. Chapela is also notable for his work with natural resources and indigenous rights.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Chapela completed his PhD dissertation research at Cardiff University on the ecology of microbial wood-rotting fungi. He continued research on a number of areas of fungal ecology through the 1990s, as a visiting scholar at various research institutions, private companies, and NGOs, finally settling at UC Berkeley, where he has been on the faculty the Department of Environmental Sciences, Policy, and Management (ESPM) since 1996.\n\nHe has worked on the symbiosis between leafcutter ants and their cultivated fungi. His research seems to indicate that some leaf-cutter ants have \"domesticated\" a single lineage of fungi for over 30 million years; Chapela is currently studying this symbiosis from evolutionary and agricultural perspectives, as well as looking for ways to manipulate it.\n\nChapela was co-author (with his graduate student, David Quist) of a controversial 2001 \"Nature\" paper about the flow of transgenes into wild \"Zea mays ssp. mexicana\" in mountains of Oaxaca in Southwestern Mexico -a culturally significant region known as the Mesoamerican center of origin for Zea mays L. Controversy over the accuracy of the claims and methodological concerns about the paper led to an editor's note saying there was insufficient evidence to justify the original publication. Advocates of GM crops widely, and erroneously, called this a retraction.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 a research team had two commercial American companies test 153,000 seeds from 870 maize plants in 125 fields in Oaxaca - the same area Chapela and Quist sampled - for transgenic DNA material. In their article published on August 8, 2005 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) they reported that no (transgenic DNA) was found. However, a more recent study published in the February 2009 issue of \"Molecular Ecology\" confirmed the presence of transgenic DNA in Mexican maize. The study, however, did not confirm an important conclusion from the 2001 \"Nature\" paper, namely, that the transgene-contaminated corn has replicated. Chapela is reported to have stated in response to the study, \"It is good to see this...but it took seven years.\"\n\nChapela objected to an agreement in which the department and faculty of Plant and Microbial Biology at UC Berkeley took money from Novartis in exchange for a degree of publication scrutiny and trade secrecy, taking a strong position on the issue.\n\nChapela was initially denied tenure at UC Berkeley in 2003, despite a unanimous vote in his favor by an ad hoc tenure committee. Supporters claim that this stems from opposition to Chapela's anti-Novartis activism from Molecular and Cell Biology faculty member Jasper Rine, who was both a member of the tenure committee and in a research relationship with the company. However, Chapela was ultimately awarded tenure in 2005.\n\nChapela has also spoken out against the deal between UC Berkeley, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and British Petroleum to research the development of biofuels, which may involve genetically engineering microorganisms and plants. The grant went into effect in 2007. The case is detailed in the German documentary .\n\nChapela founded The Mycological Facility in Oaxaca state, a facility dealing with questions of natural resources and indigenous rights, and collaborates with indigenous communities in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Ecuador on issues of rights to genetic resources. He is also an advisory board member for The Sunshine Project, an organization promoting citizens' concerns with biosafety and biowarfare.\n\nHe has appeared in several films on genetically modified organism and food systems issues, \"The World According to Monsanto\", Symphony of the Soil, and \"The Future of Food\".\n\nChapela is a member of the San Francisco Bay Area group Retort collective.\n\nList of mycologists\n\n"}

When the firm was acquired by the York and North Midland Railway in 1840, he worked under Daniel Gooch at Swindon, but left reputedly to escape Gooch's wrath. In 1841 he became the locomotive superintendent of the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway, which became the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company from 1847. In this role he was responsible for founding the Gorton locomotive works for the company. He left shortly before they were completed in 1848.\n\nIn 1847, Peacock was present with Charles Beyer at a meeting at Lickey Incline which it is generally acknowledged gave birth to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. George Stephenson was elected as first president and Charles Beyer as a vice president. Peacock became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849.\n\nHaving also had dealings with Charles Beyer through acquiring locomotives from Sharp Brothers, he joined Beyer in 1853 to establish Beyer, Peacock and Company to manufacture steam locomotives.\n\nFrom the 1885 general election until his death in 1889, Peacock was Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Gorton division of Lancashire. He was a Unitarian, and one of his contributions to the community in Gorton was the construction of Brookfield Unitarian Church, which stands today. Its bells are named after his children.\n\nEmily Faithfull, the Victorian printer and women's rights activist, dedicated her book \"Three Visits To America\" to her \"Friend Richard Peacock Esq of Gorton Hall\" in 1882.\nDuring his period in parliament Peacock was in favour of Home Rule, of the reform of the House of Lords, the disestablishment and disendowment of the Church of England, and the establishment of local self-government.\n\nPeacock was the son of Ralph Peacock, a mines supervisor from Swaledale, Yorkshire, and Dorothy Robinson. He was married twice, firstly to Hannah Crowther, and secondly to Francis Littlewood. At the time of his death his eldest son, Colonel Ralph Peacock VD (1838–1928) of the Manchester Volunteer Artillery, succeeded him at Gorton Foundry. Of his daughters the eldest, Jane Peacock (1855–1928), married William Taylor Birchenough JP, a silk manufacturer who was elder brother of Sir Henry Birchenough and son of John Birchenough. Peacock's grandson, Richard Peacock Birchenough, married Dorothy Grace Godsal, daughter of Philip Thomas Godsal, the inventor of the Godsal anti tank rifle. Peacock's youngest daughter, Eugenie, married George P. Dawson, who succeeded Colonel Peacock as managing director on the formation of the incorporated Beyer, Peacock and Company Limited in 1902. Colonel Ralph Peacock died without issue, as did Richard Peacock's only other surviving son, Frederick William Peacock (1858–1924).\n\nRichard Peacock died in Manchester at the age of 68. He is buried in the Peacock Mausoleum in the graveyard of his Brookfield Unitarian Church. The graveyard also holds the remains of Ralph Peacock and an earlier deceased son, Joseph Peacock.\n\n\n"}

He hosted a jazz radio show when he was 14. He also played clarinet and led a band in the New York area. At 17 he founded the Signature Records label and recorded many jazz greats, including Lester Young, Erroll Garner and, in 1943, Coleman Hawkins. Signature folded in 1948 and he joined Decca Records in 1952, running its Coral Records subsidiary. His wife was the singer Teresa Brewer, whom he met and produced while working for Decca Records in the 1950s.\n\nHe took over as head of Impulse! Records from 1961 to 1969 after founder Creed Taylor left to run Verve Records. Thiele's best known association while at Impulse! was with John Coltrane, but he also recorded such artists as Charles Mingus, Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Archie Shepp, and Albert Ayler among others. His most successful hit song was with Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\", which he co-wrote with George David Weiss. According to Thiele's memoir, the recording session for this now-famous song was the scene of a major clash with ABC Records president Larry Newton, who had to be locked out of the studio after getting into a heated argument with Thiele over the song. \"What a Wonderful World\" was credited to George Douglas or Stanley Clayton. These are pseudonyms Thiele used, made from the names of his uncles, Stanley, Clayton, George, and Douglas.\n\nIn the late 1960s Thiele was often brought in to produce artists on the company's Bluesway Records label. He produced the albums that graduated B.B. King toward the mainstream, including \"Lucille\" (1967). He also produced BluesWay recordings by John Lee Hooker, T-Bone Walker, and others.\n\nAfter seven years with ABC Records, the parent of Impulse!, Thiele formed his own company, Flying Dutchman Productions, in 1968. Thiele later formed his own record label, Flying Dutchman Records, which is now part of Sony Music Entertainment. Later in his career Thiele formed Doctor Jazz Records in 1983 and Red Baron Records in 1991, which released a number of albums on compact disc, including three by the Bob Thiele Collective, each a different \"all-star\" group which Thiele himself assembled and produced. In 1995 he released a memoir titled \"What a Wonderful World\".\n\nThiele remained active in the music business until the end, including the co-writing of the song \"You,\" which was recorded by Bonnie Raitt and appeared on her 1994 album \"Longing in Their Hearts\".\n\nHe died of kidney failure, according to a friend, at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan on January 30, 1996.\n\n\n"}

When his father died, he was one year old, and his mother married with King Ladislaus of Naples, who acquired all the family's possessions (1407).\n\nIn 1417 Giovanni Antonio married Pope Martin V's niece Anna Colonna, daughter of the Prince of Amalfi. After James II' renounce, he received the Principality of Taranto from queen Joanna II of Naples on 4 May 1421. This act made him the most powerful baronial lord of the Kingdom of Naples, with lands including 7 archbishoprics, 30 bishoprics, 300 castles an extending from Salerno to Taranto.\nGiovanni Antonio was also an influent member of the Neapolitan court, and remained engulfed in the struggle between Joanna and Alfonso V of Aragon, whom he supported in the civil war against John II of Anjou. When Alfonso became king of Naples, Giovanni Antonio further increased his power with the titles of Grand Constable and of Duke of Bari.\n\nHowever, when Alfonso died, he retreated to Taranto to head a group of barons against the former's son, Ferdinand I, in favour of John II. After several feats of war, Giovanni Antonio and his side were defeated, but in the end, he managed to become reconciled with the Aragonese king. He died in Altamura Castle in 1463, strangled by a certain Paolo Tricarico, perhaps a royal killer. King Ferdinand confiscated most of his lands. His niece Isabella, the legitimate heiress of Giovanni Antonio's lands, died soon afterwards in 1465. Her heir was her eldest son, the future Alfonso II of Naples.\n\n"}

{"id": "1944119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944119", "title": "Sexuality in older age", "text": "Sexuality in older age\n\nSexuality in older age concerns the sexual drive, sexual activity, interests, orientation, intimacy, self-esteem, behaviors, and overall sexuality of people in middle age and old age, and the social perceptions concerning sexuality in older age. Older people engage in a variety of sexual acts from time to time for a variety of reasons. Desire for intimacy does not disappear with age, yet there are many restrictions placed on the elderly preventing sexual expressions and discouraging the fulfillment of sexual needs. Sexuality in older age is often considered a taboo, yet it is considered to be quite a healthy practice; however, this stigma can affect how older individuals experience their sexuality. While the human body has some limits on the maximum age for reproduction, sexual activity can be performed or experienced well into the later years of life.\n\nBoth male and female libidos tend to decline with increasing age, and women tend to lose their libido faster than men. However, desire for sexual activity is not lost completely. Neither does it decrease for everyone. Menopause, a female biological process, has been linked to a loss of interest in sexual activity and to a desensitization of the genital area. In some cases, vaginal penetration can be painful for older women (see, for example, vaginismus). However, with the advent of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatments, the effects of menopause have lessened and women have more opportunities to continue experiencing an active sex life. Similarly, treatments for erectile dysfunction can make it possible for men to enjoy sexual activity again.\n\nIt has been suggested that an active sex life can increase longevity among the elderly. Positive sexual health in older age is slowly becoming more of a common place idea with the steady increase in the percentage of the older population. This population percentage increase requires placing more attention on the needs of this age group, including their ideas on sexual health, desires, and attitudes. This shift in attitudes and behaviors has combined with medical advances to prolong a sexually active life and change the landscape of aging sexuality.\n\nSexual health and expression reflects a physical, mental, and emotional need that affects individual health and intimacy quality for older couples’ relationships. Dr. Syme found that, \"Having a sexual partnership, with frequent sexual expression, having a good quality sex life, and being interested in sex have been found to be positively associated with health among middle-aged and older adults.\"\n\nThere are a number of associated health benefits with practicing positive sexual health. Positive sexual health often acts as a de-stressor promoting increased relaxation. Researchers also report health benefits detailing decreased pain sensitivity, improved cardiovascular health, lower levels of depression, increased self-esteem, and better relationship satisfaction. The former could also imply the consequences of negative sexual health and lack of sexual activity, such as depression, low self-esteem, increased frustration, and loneliness.\n\nThere are already numerous health concerns linked primarily with aging, but when sex is added into consideration, this opens up discussion for many other related concerns. Sex and aging come with many challenges for the older population as well as their primary care providers. The task for these care providers is to accommodate to the changing needs of this older sexually active generation.\n\nCommon health conditions hindering older adults are illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, degenerative and rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, cancer, kidney disease, and spinal cord injury. These conditions heavily impact individual sex lives. Separate from these are physical concerns related specifically to sexual health and bodily functions. Researchers gathered that, \"the most common concerns for older adult men include erectile dysfunction and premature climax, and older adult women most commonly report lack of desire, problems with vaginal lubrication, sexual pain, and inability to reach orgasm.\" Consideration of these aging-related health problems and sexual-related health problems together require primary care providers and professionals to be updated on the latest health findings and knowledgeable of patients’ needs and possible solutions.\n\nA major problem with improving education and seeking solutions for aging sexual health risks is the lack of verbal discussion on these matters from older aged individuals. \"Older adults often avoid seeking help for sexual concerns because of a lack of knowledge about their sexual problems, embarrassment or discomfort talking about sex, and stigma-related beliefs about older adults and sexuality in older age being inappropriate.\"\n\nAnother major problem with improving education and seeking solutions for aging sexual health risks was found after researchers looked at the readiness and training of 777 physicians and 452 nurse practitioners from the American Medical Association Masterfile. Researchers noted that amongst their representative sample there were reports of limited training in sexual health as a general topic. From this information, they assumed that \"training that is specific to older patient’s sexual health is limited, if available at all.\"\n\nThe purpose of the study was to test how knowledgeable U.S. primary care providers were on the topics of sexual health and sexuality in older age. The results of the study showcased that U.S. health care providers on average were less knowledgeable than U.S. graduate nursing students on the topics of sexual health and aging sexuality. In a comparison survey, it is also worth noting that they were reported less knowledgeable than Turkish physicians and U.S. OB/GYNs. However, the group reported to be even less knowledgeable on aging sexuality than U.S. primary care providers consisted of nursing home staffs and older adult care workers. Educated health providers are needed to educated the general public and older adults (active and inactive) on sexual health and healthy expression.\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STDs/STIs) can also be prevalent in later life, despite common misconceptions that STDs only affect younger people and groups. There has been a steady increase in the number of STDs found in elderly individuals in nursing homes and other residential living communities, belying the perception that elderly people do not engage in sexual activity. Many men in older age do not believe they need to use protection, such as condoms, as they age, and their partners often feel likewise, so it can be difficult to stress the importance of continued use of protection for elderly couples. One of the main reasons they develop this opinion is because of the decreased risk of pregnancy, but they often fail to acknowledge that protection is necessary to prevent the circulation of STDs.\n\nSex between elderly people is often treated as a taboo by society. Cultural norms dictated social opinions which painted older adults as being asexual creatures. This opinion was supported and replicated in the media by showing sex only being popular among youth. This attitude has gradually changed because a greater number of people are reaching 55 and above, and are remaining sexually active far into their senior years. The number of seniors in the United States and throughout the world continues to increase rapidly. Back in 1930, less than 6 percent of the U.S. population was over 65 years old. By 1950, the number was 8 percent. By 2015, that number has risen to almost 15 percent. Population experts at the U.S. Bureau of the Census expect the percentage to continue to rise dramatically during the next 20 years, eventually reaching 21 percent by 2050, which is more than one in five. The number of seniors in the United States and throughout the world continues to increase rapidly.\n\nWhile sexual activity itself is a sensitive topic due to its private nature, sexual activity between seniors is often treated with extra care. This attitude is especially common among younger people and it has been suggested that this may be caused by younger people's belief that the lust and ability to have sex diminishes once a perceived primary reason for sex is no longer present.\n\nEven though the topic may be taboo or denied, sexuality in older age has gained visibility in the media. Some sources promote \"active\" and \"healthy\" sexuality among the elderly, or address issues such as sexuality in retirement homes and assisted living facilities. These representations create in turn social injunctions that position sexual activity as a marker of fulfillment, a discourse already affecting younger people and amplified by various products, pills, and available medical treatments.\n\nResearch conducted in the social sciences changes the miserable depiction often made of elders' sexuality. Quantitative and qualitative studies show that sexual satisfaction can improve with age, and they present data such as the following. Half of women are sexually active into old age. Widows either stop any kind of sexual activity, find a new male partner, or choose not to reproduce the same kind of relationship where they take care of a man, instead entering into a nonresidential relationship with a man or in a relationship with another woman, for example. Women and gay men sustain the most pressure to live up to beauty ideals associated with youth. LGBT people suffer from invisibility in retirement homes and assisted-living facilities.\n\nTo many, \"The Golden Girls\" was groundbreaking in its depiction of healthy active sexual lifestyles and frank sexual discussion among seniors.\n\nThe concept of active sexual relationships between older people has in recent years become a more mainstream topic. The film \"Something's Gotta Give\" starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton explores the relationship that develops between two people in later life.\n\nThe HBO series \"Tell Me You Love Me\" has caused controversy by showing several explicit sex scenes involving two senior citizen actors on the show, Jane Alexander and David Selby. Presently old aged sex is understood and increasingly accepted in society.\n\nOn a related topic, intergenerational relationships, also quite taboo, were the focus of the film \"Gerontophilia\" (between a very old and a very young man), and in the last years many TV shows represented \"cougars\" (middle age women with younger men), for example \"The Cougar\" and \"Cougar Town\".\n\nThe Netflix original, \"Grace and Frankie\", features Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as two elderly women recently divorced from their husbands seeking guidance through life with the help of each other. Not only does the show highlight their sexual quests and struggles with their new partners, it also mentions their new partnered business seeking venture to encourage personal, private intimacy for women their age. The \"Ménage à Moi,\" as they have it named, is a vibrator targeting elderly women to use for sexual satisfaction, and the show features the struggles surrounding marketing such a product.\n"}

She is currently a vice president for the Phoenix Mercury and a color analyst for the Phoenix Suns television broadcasts. For over 26 years, she served as a network television sports analyst for TNT, ESPN, CBS, and NBC. Meyers is a Board Member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott, and is given annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year. Meyers was inducted in the inaugural class at the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999. She was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nMeyers was born on March 26, 1955, the sixth of Patricia and Bob Meyers' 11 children. Her father played guard for Marquette University, then for the Shooting Stars, a professional team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. One of her brothers, Dave, was an All-American at UCLA and went on to play for the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nMeyers attended Cornelia Connelly High school and then later Sonora High School in La Habra, California, where she was able to engage in more competitive play. As an all-around athlete, she lettered in seven sports, including in softball, badminton, field hockey, tennis, and basketball. She earned thirteen Most Valuable Player awards in high school sports. She led her basketball teams to an 80–5 record. In 1974, Meyers became the first high school student to play for the U.S. national team.\n\nMeyers was a four-year athletic scholarship player for the UCLA Bruins women's basketball team (1974–1978), the first woman to be so honored at any university. In a game against Stephen F. Austin on February 18, 1978, she recorded the first quadruple-double in NCAA Division I basketball history, with 20 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals. Since then, University of Tennessee at Martin junior guard Lester Hudson is the only other Division I basketball player, male or female, to have done so.

The USA team won all six games en route to the gold medal.\n\nIn 1980, Meyers made NBA history when she signed a $50,000 no-cut contract with NBA's Indiana Pacers. She participated in three-day tryouts for the team, the first by any woman for the NBA, but eventually was not chosen for the final squad. She became a color analyst for the team at a time when there were very few women in sportscasting.\nMeyers was the first woman player drafted by the Women's Professional Basketball League (WPBL) in 1978 to the New Jersey Gems. Playing for the Gems, Meyers was the WPBL Co-MVP for the 1979–1980 season. She wore jersey No. 15 for the Gems.

The most successful team was Romania with 4 titles.\n\nThe first edition featured Romania, Greece, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria and was played over three years from 1929 to 1931. All teams played each other twice, home and away, and were awarded 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw, with final ranking table determining the winner. Romania won the first title with a game in hand after beating Yugoslavia 4–2.\n\nIn the following tournaments the system saw significant changes, with teams playing each other only once, and instead of taking three years to complete it was shortened to just a single week. From 1932 to 1936 the competition was played every year with the same four teams until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus due to World War II, the competition was revived in 1946. Greece dropped out of the tournament the same year, and was replaced by Albania, who went on to win the 1946 edition by defeating Romania 1–0 in the final game. In 1947 Hungary entered the tournament and won it in its first attempt. Hungary were a world footballing power at the time and proved this with a 9–0 thrashing against Bulgaria. In 1948 the Balkan Cup was expanded to seven teams with Poland and Czechoslovakia joining the tournament. However, the 1948 edition was never completed due to unknown reasons. Hungary were topping the group at the time of its cancellation. Because of the expansions, the 1947 and 1948 tournaments were officially renamed Balkan and Central European Championship. \n\nThe competition was not played again until 1973 when a round robin group system was replaced by a knockout system with semi-finals and finals, played over three years. This time only four countries took part – Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. Bulgaria won the final on away goals against Romania in 1976. In 1977 the second edition of the revived tournament was launched, this time consisting of five teams with Yugoslavia returning to take part. Romania went on to win the last edition in 1980 by beating Yugoslavia 4–1 at home in the final.\n\nSource\n"}

Her father was the third son of Isabella of Brienne (who died in 1360) and her husband Walter of Enghien (who had died in 1345).\n\nHer paternal grandmother Isabella survived her brother Walter VI of Brienne, titular Duke of Athens etc., who died without surviving issue in 1356 at the Battle of Poitiers. As his heir, she became Countess of Lecce and Brienne etc., as well as titular Duchess of Athens. Since her eldest son Walter had died before her brother, her heir was her second son Sohier of Enghien. She allowed her inherited lands to be divided between her numerous children during her own lifetime. Mary's father, the third (but second surviving) son, had received the County of Lecce and the lordship of Castro.\n\nMary's father John died in 1380, leaving minor children. Mary's brother Peter of Enghien, also called Pyrrhus (Pyrro or Pirro), became the Count of Lecce. However, Peter died childless in 1384 and was succeeded by Mary and her husband Raimondo del Balzo Orsini di Nola, whom she married that same year in Taranto.\n\nChroniclers describe her as beautiful, intrepid and adventurous: adored by her children, loved by her first husband, besieged by King Ladislaus of Naples, and treated cruelly by the king's sister.\n\nShe stayed in her castles of Lecce and Copertino when Raimondo travelled, and gave his services to the king against the papal troops and supporters of the junior Angevin line. She was occupied by their children, Marias, Caterina, Giovanni Antonio, and Gabriele.\n\nRaimondo was created Prince of Taranto (in her hereditary rights) and died in 1406.\n\nAfter his husband's death, she was sieged in Taranto (1406) and resisted the troops of Ladislaus till he decided to propose her to be his wife. So she was forced to marry Ladislaus and the wedding was held in the chapel of the Castle of Taranto. Her second marriage was childless. Ladislaus died on 6 August 1414; his sister and successor Joan II of Naples, described as cruel, hated Mary and imprisoned her. Joan's husband James II, Count of La Marche, however, soon allowed her to go. She returned to Lecce, Joan having driven her and her children from the royal domains, back to Tarentine lands.\n\nMary lived a long life, dying at the age of 78. She witnessed the marriage of her granddaughter Isabella of Clermont, daughter of Tristan and Catherine and an heiress of remarkable feudal possessions in Southern Italy, to Ferdinand of Aragon in 1444.

{"id": "1944176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944176", "title": "Baba Vanga", "text": "Baba Vanga\n\nVangeliya Pandeva Gushterova (née Dimitrova; ; 3 October 1911 – 11 August 1996), commonly known as Baba Vanga (; \"Grandmother Vanga\"), was a blind Bulgarian mystic, clairvoyant, and herbalist, who spent most of her life in the Rupite area in the Kozhuh mountains in Bulgaria. Zheni Kostadinova claimed in 1997 that millions of people believed she possessed paranormal abilities.\n\nVanga was born in 1911 to Pando and Paraskeva (Surcheva) Surchev in Strumica, then in the Ottoman Empire, but in 1912 the city was ceded to Bulgaria. She was a premature baby who suffered from health complications. In accordance with local tradition, the baby was not given a name until it was deemed likely to survive. When the baby first cried out, a midwife went into the street and asked a stranger for a name. The stranger proposed \"Andromaha\" (Andromache), but this was rejected for being \"too Greek\" during a period of anti-Hellenic sentiment within Bulgarian Macedonian society. Another stranger's proposal was a Greek name, but since she was Bulgarian: \"Vangelia\" (from Evangelos).\n\nIn her childhood, Vangelia was an ordinary child with brown eyes and blonde hair. Her father was an Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization activist, conscripted into the Bulgarian Army during World War I, and her mother died soon after. This left Vanga dependent on the care and charity of neighbours and close family friends for much of her youth. After the war, Strumica was ceded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (i.e. Yugoslavia). Yugoslav authorities arrested her father because of his pro-Bulgarian activity. They confiscated all his property and the family fell into poverty for many years. Vanga was considered intelligent for her age. Her inclinations started to show up when she herself thought out games and loved playing \"healing\" – she prescribed some herbs to her friends, who pretended to be ill. Her father, being a widower, eventually remarried, thus providing a stepmother to his daughter.\n\nAccording to her own testimony, a turning point in her life occurred when a 'tornado' allegedly lifted her into the air and threw her in a nearby field. She was found after a long search. Witnesses described her as very frightened, and her eyes were covered with sand and dust, she was unable to open them because of the pain. There was money only for a partial operation to heal the injuries she had sustained. This resulted in a gradual loss of sight.\n\nIn 1925 Vanga was brought to a school for the blind in the city of Zemun, in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where she spent three years, and was taught to read Braille, play the piano, as well as do knitting, cooking, and cleaning. After the death of her stepmother she had to go back home to take care of her younger siblings. Her family was very poor, and she had to work all day.\n\nIn 1939 Vanga contracted pleurisy, although it remained largely inactive for some years. The doctor's opinion was that she would die soon, but she quickly recovered.\n\nDuring World War II, Yugoslavia was invaded and dismembered by the Axis powers and Strumica was annexed by Bulgaria. At that time Vanga attracted believers in her ability to heal and soothsay – a number of people visited her, hoping to get a hint about whether their relatives were alive, or seeking for the place where they died. On 8 April 1942 the Bulgarian tzar Boris III visited her.\n\nOn 10 May 1942, Vanga married Dimitar Gushterov, a Bulgarian soldier from the village of Krandzhilitsa near Petrich, who had come asking for the killers of his brother, but had to promise her not to seek revenge. Shortly before marriage, Dimitar and Vanga moved to Petrich, where she soon became well-known. Dimitar was then conscripted in the Bulgarian Army and had to spend some time in Northern Greece, which was annexed by Bulgaria at the time. He got another illness in 1947, fell into alcoholism, and eventually died on 1 April 1962.\n\nShe continued to be visited by dignitaries and commoners. After the Second World War, Bulgarian politicians and leaders from different Soviet Republics, including Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, sought her counsel; in the 1990s, a church was built in Rupite by Bogdan Tomalevski with money left by her visitors. Vanga died on 11 August 1996 from breast cancer. Her funeral attracted large crowds, including many dignitaries.\n\nFulfilling Vanga's last will and testament, her Petrich house was turned into a museum, which opened its doors for visitors on 5 May 2008.\n\nVanga was semi-literate in Bulgarian; she could read some Braille in Serbian, as she learned in Zemun. She did not write any books herself. What she said or allegedly said had been captured by staff members. Later, numerous esoteric books on Vanga's life and predictions were written.\n\nSources such as \"The Weiser Field Guide to the Paranormal\" claim that she foretold the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Chernobyl disaster, the date of Stalin's death, the sinking of the Russian submarine \"Kursk\", the September 11 attacks, Topalov's victory in the world chess tournament, the tensions with North Korea. On the other hand, Bulgarian sources say that the people who were close to her claim that she never prophesied about \"Kursk\", World War III, or other subjects circulating the Internet, and that many of the myths about Vanga are simply not true. Some evidence has also been presented that Baba Vanga did not make many of the predictions now attributed to her, but rather people frequently attribute new fake \"prophecies\" to her since her death, and the lack of a written record of her prophecies, makes any prediction attributed to her difficult to disprove.\n\nIn early August 1976, Yugoslav actress and singer Silvana Armenulić was on tour in Bulgaria and decided to meet with Baba Vanga. Vanga only sat and stared out a window with her back to Silvana, never speaking to her. After a long time, Vanga finally spoke: \"\"Nothing. You do not have to pay. I do not want to speak with you. Not now. Go and come back in three months.\"\" As Silvana turned around and walked towards the door, Vanga said: \"\"Wait. In fact, you will not be able to come. Go, go. If you can come back in three months, do so.\"\" Silvana took this as confirmation that she would die and left Vanga's home in tears. Armenulić died two months later, 10 October 1976, in a car crash with her sister Mirjana.\n\nVanga incorrectly predicted that the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final would be played between \"two teams beginning with B\". One finalist was Brazil, but Bulgaria was eliminated by Italy in the semifinals. According to \"The National\", Vanga predicted that World War III would start in November 2010 and last until October 2014.\n\nBaba Vanga also predicted the existence of extraterrestrial djinns. Vanga purportedly predicted another \"realm of being\", claiming that entire cultures would begin to spread through a \"false world\". She claimed that in 2003, any person would be able to think in synchronicity with others, allowing for a form of secondary existence.\n\nFollowers of Vanga believe that she predicted the precise date of her own death, dreaming that she would die on 11 August, and be buried on 13 August. Shortly before that she had said that a ten-year-old blind girl living in France was to inherit her gift, and that people would soon hear about her.\n\nAnother prediction attributed to her is that the 44th President of the United States would be the country's last Commander-in-chief. It has also been claimed that Vanga correctly predicted the 44th President would be African-American. Vanga's supporters also claimed that she predicted the 45th president will be with a \"messianic personality\", who will be faced with a crisis that eventually \"brings the country down\".\n\nAn attempt was made in 2011 to systematically summarize the existing knowledge about Vanga in the documentary \"Vanga: The Visible and Invisible World\". The movie includes interviews with some of the people who met Vanga in person, including Sergey Medvedev (press secretary to the then President of Russia Boris Yeltsin in 1995–96; who visited as Yeltsin's envoy), Neshka Robeva (Bulgarian rhythmic gymnast and coach), Sergey Mikhalkov (Soviet and Russian writer, author of the Soviet Union anthem), Nevena Tosheva (director of the first documentary about Vanga), Kirsan Ilyumzhinov (Kalmyk multi-millionaire businessman and politician). According to the documentary, Baba Vanga predicted Yeltsin's second electoral victory in 1995, and warned him about his heart condition.\n\nSeveral researchers have studied the phenomenon of Vanga in the attempt to establish whether she has any extraordinary capabilities. One of the first studies was initiated by the Bulgarian government and is described in the 1977 movie \"Fenomen\" directed by Nevena Tosheva. Bulgarian psychiatrists and Georgi Lozanov also studied the capabilities of Vanga. According to Jeffrey Mishlove, some of the studies concluded that about 80% of predictions of Vanga turned out to be accurate.\n\n\"Vangelia\", a 24-episode biographical TV series with elements of mysticism, was commissioned in 2013 by Channel One Russia.\n\nEnglish gothic metal band Paradise Lost used a photo of her for the cover art of their sixth album \"One Second\".\n\nThe supposed clairvoyant's predictions, political speculations with them, and their criticism continue to appear in the mass media in different countries and in different languages.\n\nHer image is popular in Southeastern Europe (the Balkans) and in Eastern Europe, especially Russia. Russian publications related to the mysterious prophetess are numerous. \"The Great Encyclopedia of Vanga\" is a Russian online project, dedicated to her.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944178", "title": "Active layer", "text": "Active layer\n\nIn environments containing permafrost, the active layer is the top layer of soil that thaws during the summer and freezes again during the autumn. In all climates, whether they contain permafrost or not, the temperature in the lower levels of the soil will remain more stable than that at the surface, where the influence of the ambient temperature is greatest. This means that, over many years, the influence of cooling in winter and heating in summer (in temperate climates) will decrease as depth increases.\n\nIf the winter temperature is below the freezing point of water, a frost front will form in the soil. This \"frost front\" is the boundary between frozen and unfrozen soil, and with the coming of spring and summer, the soil is thawed, \"always from the top down\". If the heating during summer exceeds the cooling during winter, the soil will be completely thawed during the summer and there will be no permafrost. This occurs when the mean annual temperature is above 0 °C (32 °F), but also occurs when the mean annual temperature is slightly below 0 °C on sites exposed to the sun with coarse-textured parent materials (vegetation).\n\nWhen there is not sufficient heat to thaw the frozen soil completely, permafrost forms. The active layer in this environment consists of the top layers of soil which thaws during the summer, while the inactive layer refers to the soil below which is frozen year-round because the heat fails to penetrate. Liquid water cannot flow below the active layer, with the result that permafrost environments tend to be very poorly drained and boggy.\n\nThe thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface.\n\nThus, the primary determinant of active layer thickness is the maximum temperature attained during the summer. If it is only a little above 0 °C, the active layer can be very thin (only 10 cm on Ellesmere Island), whilst if it is quite warm, it is much thicker (about 2.5 m at Yakutsk), and if the permafrost is discontinuous and soil begins thawing earlier, it can be still thicker (5 meters at Yellowknife). The parent material of the soil is also important: active layers in soils made of sandy or gravelly parent materials can be up to five times deeper than those made from loam- or clay-rich parent material. This is because the coarser material allows for much greater conductivity of heat down into the soil.\n\nThis is important because roots of plants cannot penetrate beyond the active layer and are restricted by its thickness. Thus, in a continuous permafrost environment plants must have shallow roots, which restricts tree growth to specialised species such as \"Larix\". In areas of discontinuous permafrost, most conifers are able to grow easily.\n\nCryoturbation is the dominant force operating in the active layer, and tends to make it generally uniform in composition throughout. However, variation in the composition of soils due to differences in parent rock are very marked in permafrost regions due to the low rate of weathering in the very cold climate.\n\nThe slow rate of decomposition of organic material means gelisols (permafrost soils) are very important as a sink for carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (chiefly methane) forms from the very slow decomposition of the excess organic matter that remains in most gelisols and is mixed down into the pereletok layer during relatively hot summers and below that layer during warmer periods about 5000 to 6000 years ago. This storage of carbon means thawing of permafrost may accelerate global warming - some suggest the difference could become very significant especially if the carbon has been stored since \"before\" the recent glacial maxima.\n"}

{"id": "1944192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944192", "title": "Rupite", "text": "Rupite\n\nRupite (, ) is a village which includes a small mountainous protected area in the southeastern part of Blagoevgrad Province, Bulgaria, 10-12 kilometres northeast of Petrich, inside Petrich Municipality, on the right bank of the Struma River. It is best known as the place where the Bulgarian medium Baba Vanga lived and was buried. The area is in fact the crater of an extinct volcano, its appearance being shaped by the volcanic hill of Kozhuh, the thermal springs and Pchelina Hill. The village has 1,124 inhabitants.\nRupite is a protected area, which is situated at a distance of about 10 km from Petrich and 2 km from the village of Rupite, at the eastern foot of the extinct volcano Kozhuh Mountain (281 meters altitude). The hill was built by volcanic rocks. Its name comes from the fact that it looks like a mantle (kozhuh in Bulgarian). In 1962 a part of the locality of Kozhuh – 0.4 hectares – was declared a natural landmark. \nThe protected area of Rupite is famous for its healing mineral springs with a temperature of 74° C and capacity of up to 35 l/sec. The climate in the locality is transitional-Mediterranean, which is a reason for the presence of Mediterranean grass vegetation and some thermoliphic animal species. The natural by-river forest consists mainly of White Poplar (Populus Alba).\nThe protected areas of Rupite and Kozhuh Mountain are homes to various snake species. Here you can see the relatively rare species – Cat Snake (Telescopus fallax). There are 201 bird species in the Rupite area, including various Mediterranean species, which can rarely be seen in other places in our country. Via Aristotelis passes through this area. This is one of the two basic bird migration routes through the territory of the country. In the region visitors can see species, such as the Large Olive Warbler (Нippolais Olivetorum), White-headed Shrike (Lanius nubicus) and Black-headed Shrike (Lanius minor). During the migration and the wintering period here stays the globally endangered species Small Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus).\nThe remains of an ancient town, existing within the period from 4th century BC to the 6th century AD are located along the south slopes and at the foot of the volcanic hill Kozhuh. According to explorers, this was the main town of the Thracian tribe Sints – Heraclea Sintica.\nThe memorial temple “St. Petka of Bulgaria”, built in 1994 is situated in the locality of Rupite. The locality is mostly famous as a place related to the prophet Vanga, and by this it attracts thousands of worshippers and tourists. Vangeliya Gushterova (1911 – 1996), is the full name of the prophet, was famous around the whole world with her multiple prophecies which had come true. According to a legend, Vanga lost her sight in her early childhood years in a storm, but during the accident she had a vision, which gave her the unique abilities. In the last years of her life, Vanga lived in a small house in the Rupite, because according to her relatives she considered the area an energy source and collected her powers from it. The church was built by monetary means, provided by Vanga, and it is notable for its wall paintings. They were made by the famous Bulgarian artist Svetlin Rusev and they are quite realistic, which differentiates them from the Orthodox canon. Despite the fact that the temple was not built according to the rules of the Orthodox church, it attracts thousands of worshippers and tourists because of its connection with Grandmother Vanga.\n\nThe landscape of Rupite is dominated by the eminence of Kozhuh (Кожух, \"fur coat\", taking its name from its shape resembling a fur coat thrown on) situated to the west. Although it is only 281 m high, it rises like a high mountain from the low and flat Petrich Plain. The eminence, which is part of the outskirts of the extinct volcano, consists of three small summits, of which the middle one is the highest. Volcanic rocks and rock pyramids can be observed at the foot of Kozhuh. Due to the eminence's interesting origin (often called \"the only volcano in Bulgaria\") and the abundance of rare species of the Bulgarian flora and fauna, Kozhuh is a proclaimed natural landmark since 1962. Remains of an ancient town called \"Petra\", were discovered at the southwestern foot of Kozhuh. In 2002, the scientists came across the proof of their identification of the city: a Latin inscription, dated 308 AD, of an imperial appeal addressed to the local urban citizens of Heraclea Sintica. Thus ended the years-long argument between Greece and Bulgaria about where Heraclea Sintica actually was.\n\nApart from the eminence, Rupite is also known for the curative hot springs issuing in the area, with a temperature of 71-78 °C and an average discharge of 35 l/s. The climate in Rupite is very specific, transitional between continental and Mediterranean and featuring hot dry summers and mild winters, which is one of the reasons for the variety of rare plant species, 13 of which are endangered in Bulgaria. 201 bird species inhabit the area, including a number of species typical for the Mediterranean that are not present in other areas of the country. Almost all of the snake species that can be observed in Bulgaria can be found in Rupite, as well as four species of tortoises and other animals that prefer relatively high temperatures.\nThe Church of St Petka was constructed at a site chosen by Baba Vanga in 1992 and has since then become a place of worship for many people and a renowned tourist attraction. The icons were created by the noted artist Svetlin Rusev and were not generally approved by the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church for being too realistic and not conforming to the canons. The house of Vanga can be seen nearby and a new monastery is currently under construction.\n\nRupite Glacier on Smith Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Rupite.\n\n\n"}

Clark of BMB Compuscience in 1984. It was originally written to run on the IBM PC under MS-DOS. The game involves piloting a Sopwith biplane, attempting to bomb enemy buildings while avoiding fire from enemy planes and various other obstacles.\n\n\"Sopwith\" was created to demonstrate the \"Imaginet\" proprietary networking system developed by BMB Compuscience. David L. Clark, employed as a programmer at BMB, developed Sopwith as a multiplayer game. The multiplayer function would not operate without the Imaginet hardware and drivers. However, single-player functionality was also included, with the player flying alone or against computer-controlled planes. Because of this, the game was widely distributed, even though the Imaginet system itself was not hugely successful. Sopwith 2 added the ability to play multiplayer over an async serial interface, but a BMB dictionary driver (NAMEDEV.SYS) and a BMB serial communications driver (SERIAL.SYS or SERWORK.SYS) are then needed.\n\nAll versions of \"Sopwith\" feature four-color CGA graphics. Sound is provided by the PC speaker in the form of music and sound effects.\n\nThe C and x86 assembly source code to \"Sopwith\" was released in 2000, at first under a non-commercial use license, but later under the GNU GPL at the request of fans.\n\nFollowing the source code release, \"SDL Sopwith\" was written as a C port/rewrite of \"Sopwith 2: The Author's Edition\" written in 2001 by Simon Howard which utilizes the Simple DirectMedia Layer library to interact with graphics and sound hardware, all while preserving the CGA graphics of the original game. With the source code of this version, \"SDL Sopwith\" can be theoretically compiled for any system which has an SDL library available for it, including non-x86 systems.\n\nPlayers begins at their base (typically a hangar and a runway). From here the player must launch the plane and attack targets. This stage can be a challenge for inexperienced players, as sufficient speed is needed to get the plane into the air; insufficient speed will cause the plane to stall and crash.\n\nThe plane is equipped with a machine gun and a supply of bombs. This weaponry can be used to destroy enemy buildings and down enemy planes. Gauges in the status bar at the bottom of the screen show the remaining lives, fuel, bombs and bullets, respectively.\n\nIn \"Sopwith 2\", obstacles exist in the form of oxen and birds. The oxen simply stand on the ground; if the player crashes into one, or shoots one, the game deducts 200 points and the plane crashes. The birds provide a more challenging obstacle: they move along the top of the screen in a flock and if shot at or flown into will disperse into individual birds. Flying into a bird causes the plane to crash.\n\nIf the player manages to destroy all enemy buildings, the plane turns and flies into the sunset. In \"Sopwith 1\" this is the end of the game, but in later versions the game advances to the next level. Successive levels increase in speed and add buildings that may return fire.\n\nThe ox was included as an in-joke and refers to an employee at BMB named \"Ox\" (aka David Growden).\n\n\n"}

As the granddaughter of Hugh of Brienne, Count of Lecce etc., she was a descendant of the Kings of Jerusalem and of Cyprus.\n\nHer father's life was largely spent in Greece, where he tried to win back his mother's inheritance, the Duchy of Athens. Walter V of Brienne hired the Catalan Company, a group of mercenaries founded by Roger de Flor, to fight against the Byzantine successor states of Epirus and Nicaea, but when he tried to cheat and kill them in 1311, they slew him at the Battle of Halmyros and took over the Duchy, making Catalan the official language and replacing the French and Byzantine-derived laws of the Principality of Achaea with the laws of Catalonia, soon making it up as Duchy of Neopatras. When the duke Gauthier was killed, Isabella's mother Jeanne de Châtillon (died 1354), daughter of count of Porcien, may have tried to hold the Acropolis of Athens against the attacking Catalans, but eventually surrendered it. The Brienne family retainers continued to hold the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia under Walter of Foucherolles. Duchess Joanna however fled with her two young children to France, where the family had properties in Champagne, around Brienne-le-Chateau. The impoverished family was not able to provide better, and Isabella married a Walloon knight, Walter III of Enghien, whose lordships in and around the Hainaut were not unsubstantial (Condé, Enghien).\n\nHer brother Walter VI of Brienne gradually gained better positions, and by allying with the Angevin kings of Naples, recovered some Italian fiefs. As constable of France, he was killed in the battle of Poitiers in 1356. He had also been Lord of Florence, Marshal of France, Count of Lecce, Conversano etc. He was an ally of the Angevins of Naples, and participated in their policies in Italy. His children died young, both with his first wife Margherita of Anjou-Tarent and his second, his distant kinswoman Jeanne de Brienne. His sister Isabella's children therefore succeeded to his possessions and claims. Already by 1350, Isabella's heir Sohier of Enghien resided in Greece and held Argos and Nauplia.\n\nIsabella survived her brother, whom she succeeded, and died in 1360. Her husband Walter of Enghien had died in 1345.\n\nFor a few years, she was Countess of Lecce and Brienne, as well as titular Duchess of Athens and of other claimed titles. Since her eldest son Gauthier had died before her brother, her heir was her second son Sohier of Enghien. She allowed her inherited lands to be divided between her numerous children during her own lifetime.\n\nIsabella's brother Gauthier had left Greece sometime in the 1340s, and her eldest surviving son Sohier of Enghien apparently was resident lord of Argos and Nauplia from c. 1350. In the division of the inheritance in 1356-60, he received the title of Duke of Athens, and certain rights in Argos-Nauplia. However, her sixth son Guy of Enghien received the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in the division and resided there as the lord from 1356 to 1377. Guy was also sometimes titled Duke of Athens, although the title officially belonged to his elder brother and the latter's son, and they as Dukes of Athens were overlords of Guy and Guy's heirs.\n\nIsabella's fourth son Louis of Enghien, Lord of Conversano, received the (titular) Duchy of Athens in 1381, when his nephew's inheritance was divided.\n\nGuy's daughter Maria d'Enghien, Isabella's granddaughter, married Pietro Cornaro, a Venetian. They sold the lordship to Venice in 1388.\n\nHer main inheritance went, after some interludes, to the children of her third son John of Enghien: Peter I of Enghien, who died childless, and Mary of Enghien (1367–1446).\n\nHer children were:\n"}

{"id": "1944214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944214", "title": "Suomen Joutsen", "text": "Suomen Joutsen\n\nSuomenJoutsen is a steel-hulled full rigged ship with three square rigged masts. Built in 1902 by Chantiers de Penhoët in St. Nazaire, France, as Laënnec, the ship served two French owners before she was sold to German interest in 1922 and renamed Oldenburg. In 1930, she was acquired by the Government of Finland, refitted to serve as a school ship for the Finnish Navy and given her current name. \"Suomen Joutsen\" made eight long international voyages before the Second World War and later served in various support and supply roles during the war. From 1961 on she served as a stationary seamen's school for the Finnish Merchant Navy. In 1991, \"Suomen Joutsen\" was donated to the city of Turku and became a museum ship moored next to Forum Marinum.\n\nIn 1902, the French shipping company Société Anonyme des Armateurs Nantais ordered two 3,100-ton full rigged ships from Chantiers de Penhoët in Saint-Nazaire. The first ship, launched on 7 August 1902, was christened \"Laënnec\" after René Laennec, a French doctor and inventor of the stethoscope. On 18 September 1902 she was followed by the second ship, named \"Haudaudine\" after Pierre Haudaudine, which was lost off the coast of New Caledonia on 3 January 1905. On 23 October 1902 \"Laënnec\" left Saint-Nazaire and headed to Cardiff, England, to load coal bound for Iquique, Chile.\n\n\"Laënnec\" was almost sunk on her maiden voyage when she collided with an English steam ship \"Penzance\" in the Bay of Biscay, sinking the fully laden steamer within minutes. \"Laënnec\", also seriously damaged, was towed to Barry for repairs. One of the reasons for the incident was that she was not carrying enough sailing ballast on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying potassium nitrate from Chile to Bremerhaven, Germany, a minor mutiny broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turbé.\n\nIn 1906 \"Laënnec\" was sold to a French shipping company Compagnie Plisson. She made several voyages across the Atlantic Ocean and around Kap Horn to the Pacific Ocean, and around the Cape of Good Hope to Australia under the command of Captain Achille Guriec. On her way back to Europe she carried wheat or potassium nitrate.\n\nOn 12 December 1911, while unloading potassium nitrate at the port of Santander, Spain, \"Laënnec\" was severely damaged when a storm pushed her against the pier and ripped the ship from her moorings, causing the full rigged ship to drift against a Dutch steam ship \"Rhehania\". As there was no shipyard large enough to accommodate \"Laënnec\" in Santander, the ship was emptied and inclined until her damaged hull plating was exposed and could be repaired within the harbour. The repairs took 20 days and the ship, which by that time had become a popular attraction for the local people, left Spain on 1 February 1912. In 1914 the main mast of \"Laënnec\" broke off and fell over the starboard side when the ship was struck by a heavy storm in the North Atlantic Ocean. She was towed to Brest for repairs. On 12 June 1916 Captain Guriec died onboard \"Laënnec\" while the ship was passing the Cape of Good Hope on her way back to Europe. The command was assumed by the first mate who, according to some sources, also perished before the ship arrived in England. Later the command was given to Captain Émile Delanoë.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, \"Laënnec\" was equipped with two deck guns. Due to the presence of German U-boats in Europe, the ship spent the war years trading in the United States East Coast. After the war, she arrived back to her home port, Saint-Nazaire, after a 150-day voyage from Australia to be stripped and laid up. On 1 December 1920 \"Laënnec\" was put for sale.\n\nIn late November 1922, after having been laid up for two years, \"Laënnec\" was sold to a German shipping company H. H. Schmidt & Co. from Hamburg. After refitting she was renamed \"Oldenburg\" after the city of Oldenburg and, through an agreement with the German school ship association Deutscher Schulschiffverein, she became a school ship for the German merchant navy. Among the men who received their training onboard \"Oldenburg\" over the years was the German U-boat ace Günther Prien.\n\nIn 1925, while rounding Kap Horn, \"Oldenburg\" lost her main mast in a storm and had to seek shelter due to damaged rigging. After emergency repairs in Montevideo, Uruguay, she crossed the Atlantic and headed back to Hamburg. However, due to strong easterly winds she was forced to pass the British Isles on the northern side instead of the English Channel. 78 days after leaving the Río de la Plata estuary, \"Oldenburg\" was taken into tow by a German tugboat and towed to Hamburg.\n\nIn 1928 \"Oldenburg\" was sold to another German shipping company, Seefart Segelschiffs-Reederei GmbH from Bremen. In 1930, on her last voyage under the German flag, \"Oldenburg\" was almost lost when the cargo of phosphate shifted in heavy weather. After two weeks in a heavy storm, the longitudinal bulkhead gave way and the ship assumed a list of 55 degrees. Lifeboats, spare yards and the kitchen stove were lost overboard. However, the crew managed to righten the ship and sail her to Malmö, Sweden. After unloading the ship was moved to Bremerhaven to be laid up.\n\nAlthough the school ship was left out from the Finnish Naval Act of 1927, the Finnish Navy decided to keep looking for a suitable vessel and purchase it separately from the major fleet renewal program. Over the years, opinions both in favor and against a school ship had been presented, but it was generally agreed that such vessel would be in many ways beneficial for the Finnish Navy. Initially there was also disagreement about the type of the ship — some were in favor of a modern steam ship that could be used in the local waters while the others preferred a traditional sailing ship that would teach the cadets traditional seaman skills and bring them closer to merchant mariners. The latter was also recommended by foreign naval officials, and finally the Finnish Navy agreed on a sailing ship. This was further helped by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that had brought the prices down, and the fact that windjammers had been largely replaced by steam ships.\n\nIn April 1930, the Parliament of Finland allotted 4,000,000 Finnish markkas for procuring a second-hand full-rigged ship and refitting it as a school ship for the Finnish Navy. During the summer of 1930, the Finnish officials inspected a number of Finnish and foreign ships that were offered for sale. These included Gustav Erikson's four-masted barques \"Pommern\" and \"Herzogin Cecilie\", and several other ships, but all were deemed either too large or too dilapidated. In the end, the most suitable candidate came from Germany where \"Oldenburg\", a 28-year-old former school ship of the German merchant navy, was offered for sale. After inspecting the ship in Bremen, the Finnish officials purchased her in August 1930 and the German crew sailed the ship to Helsinki.\n\nAfter having been handed over to the Finnish Navy, \"Oldenburg\" was towed to Uusikaupunki for refitting. The work, which began in late 1930 and continued until November 1931, included replacing part of the bottom plating, building an additional tweendeck, refurbishing the rigging, painting the whole ship and rebuilding her cargo holds to accommodate up to 180 men. The shipyard was responsible for the structural alterations while 62 future crew members and cadets of the Finnish Navy were responsible for the other tasks, including carrying 1,200 tons of stones to the ship as sailing ballast.\n\nOn 1 November 1931, after a number of delays, \"Oldenburg\" was renamed \"SuomenJoutsen\" (Swan of Finland) after \"Finska Svan\", a Swedish 16th century warship that took part in the naval action of 7July1565 between Sweden and Denmark. After launching, \"SuomenJoutsen\" broke her moorings in the strong breeze and damaged two ships, gunboat \"Karjala\" and \"Osmo\", a laid-up full rigged ship built in 1869, before she was brought under control. On 4 November 1931, she left the shipyard for Helsinki, under tow and escorted by minelayer \"M-1\".\n\nDue to delays during the refitting and later problems with the steam heating system, the first voyage of \"SuomenJoutsen\" was delayed until late December. Captain Arvo Lieto proposed postponing the departure until the next autumn as Christmas was drawing near and the sea was already freezing, but on 21 December 1931 President P. E. Svinhufvud ordered the ship to begin her first international school sailing under the Finnish flag. \"SuomenJoutsen\" was towed to the sea on the following day, but she had to wait for favourable winds outside Porkkala until 28 December, at which point she had already been grounded once. The streak of bad luck continued when the ship was anchored in Trongisvágsfjørður in Suðuroy, Faroe Islands, after stopping to purchase more lubrication oil at Trongisvágur. \"SuomenJoutsen\" dragged her anchors in a storm measuring 11–12 on the Beaufort scale, drifting stern first towards the shore. After two trawlers and a tugboat managed to get the full rigged ship safely to the harbour, it was found out that the rudder had been damaged and the ship was towed to England for drydocking. After repairs, \"SuomenJoutsen\" continued to the Canary Islands, where she remained for three weeks while Captain Lieto was relieved of command and replaced by John Konkola, who served as the captain of the school ship for six full and two partial voyages. From the Canary Islands, \"SuomenJoutsen\" headed south, but the refrigeration system failed before the Equator and she had to turn back before a line-crossing ceremony could be held. However, the crew got some consolation when news about the end of prohibition in Finland reached the ship while she was sailing towards Finland in the Baltic Sea. \"SuomenJoutsen\" arrived in Finland on 22 May 1932 and was drydocked at Suomenlinna shortly thereafter.\n\nThe second voyage of \"Suomen Joutsen\" began on 18 October 1932, and after stopping briefly in the Canady Islands and Cape Verde, she crossed the Equator on 11 December for the first time flying the Finnish flag. On 24 December, the crew celebrated traditional Finnish Christmas outside Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and arrived at the port on the following morning. The visit of \"Cisne Blanco de Finlandia\", the white swan of Finland, was widely covered in local newspapers. From Rio de Janeiro, \"Suomen Joutsen\" continued her voyage to Montevideo, Uruguay, and then, against her original sailing plan, to Buenos Aires. After leaving Argentine and visiting a number of ports in the Caribbean, \"Suomen Joutsen\" crossed the Atlantic and finally arrived in Finland on 3 May 1933. On the way back, her crew caught a number of sea turtles for the Helsinki Zoo.\nOn her third international sailing, \"Suomen Joutsen\" left Helsinki on 1 November 1933 and headed to the Mediterranean, where she visited the ports of Marseille, Alexandria and Naples. While heading towards Gibraltar on her way to the Atlantic, an English steam ship tauntingly offered to tow the Finnish full rigged ship which was sailing slowly close to the wind. However, shortly afterwards the wind changed its direction and \"Suomen Joutsen\" overtook the steamer with a towing line hanging from the stern hawsehole, offering to provide assistance for the slower ship. After stopping briefly at the Canary Islands, the ship crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Haiti on 10 March 1934 after 25 days of sailing. The return voyage began six days later. On 6 April, while in the middle of the Northern Atlantic, \"Suomen Joutsen\" was hit by hurricane-force winds that caused the ship to list almost 56 degrees. She survived the worst storm of her career without major damage and arrived in Helsinki on 16 May 1934.\n\n\"Suomen Joutsen\" began her fourth voyage on 30 October 1934 and arrived at her first stop, Cartagena in Spain, in late November. While sailing towards the Greek port city of Piraeus outside Sardinia on 7 December, she was overtaken by the Italian 51,000-ton ocean liner SS \"Rex\" which passed \"Suomen Joutsen\" at full speed of from a distance of only . Although the holder of the Blue Riband was a sight to behold, seeing a full rigged ship underway in the open seas was also becoming a rare treat. After visiting various ports in the Mediterranean, the ship returned to the Atlantic and stopped briefly at Ponta Delgada, but crossed neither the Atlantic nor the Equator. \"Suomen Joutsen\" returned to Helsinki on 3 May 1935.\n\nThe fifth voyage of \"Suomen Joutsen\" was the longest the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at Lisbon, Portugal, and then continued across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the Panama canal on 26 December. It took eleven and a half hours to transit the canal. After leaving Panama behind, \"Suomen Joutsen\" headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at Callao in Peru and Valparaiso in Chile, where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, \"Suomen Joutsen\" sailed around the Cape Horn without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship \"Almirante Saldanha\", whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. \"Suomen Joutsen\" sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung \"Happy Birthday to You\" at 6:30 in the morning, he stuck his head out from the cabin door and yelled \"Steward, give them booze!\" \"Suomen Joutsen\" arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship all the way to the harbour, crossing the narrow Kustaanmiekka strait at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at Katajanokka, he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.\n\nOn her sixth voyage, the most important stop of \"Suomen Joutsen\" was New York City, where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, Senegal and a number of ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the United States under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the Hudson River, an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and \"Suomen Joutsen\" remained the center of attention for the six days she was moored at the western end of the 35th Street. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed to talk a local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at Oslo, \"Suomen Joutsen\" arrived in Helsinki on the May Day of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living crocodile under his arm, captured for the Helsinki Zoo.\n\nThe seventh voyage of \"Suomen Joutsen\" began on 20 October 1937 and took the ship first across the Atlantic to South America. After calling Montevideo, she continued east to Cape Town, stopping at Tristan da Cunha along the way. The seventh voyage has often been called the unluckiest one as three crew members were lost before the ship arrived back in Finland on 12 May 1938. On 7 February, a seaman fell from the bow mast and was buried at sea on the following day. On the way to Cape Town, a sergeant became ill and later died in a hospital in South Africa on 10 March. On 10 May, a member of the regular crew fell to the sea while painting the hull when the ship was underway in the Baltic Sea. Many thought that the deaths were due to the crew killing three albatrosses earlier in the voyage. Finally, when \"Suomen Joutsen\" was outside Helsinki, a small airplane flew too close to the ship and crashed into the sea, but the pilots were rescued.\n\n\"Suomen Joutsen\" left for her eighth and last international voyage on 27 October 1938. After stopping at Copenhagen for provisions and clearing the English Channel — and almost colliding with the Polish passenger ship \"Piłsudski\" — she continued to the Bay of Biscay. However, waves forced \"Suomen Joutsen\" to turn back on 23 November and head to Bordeaux to wait for the weather to clear. Captain Konkola, concerned about his ailing health, was relieved of his duty and replaced by Unto Voionmaa on 3 December 1938. Under his command, \"Suomen Joutsen\" crossed the Atlantic twice, calling the ports of Pernambuco in Brazil and San Juan in Puerto Rico. On her last stop at Rotterdam, there were already signs of a major conflict in the air, and had the war started before the ship arrived in Finland, she would have headed to the United Kingdom. \"Suomen Joutsen\" arrived in Helsinki on 22 April 1939, after which she never left the Baltic Sea again.\nDuring the summer of 1939, the rigging of \"SuomenJoutsen\" was partially dismantled and her hull was painted dark grey. She was used as a supply ship for the Finnish submarine fleet within the Finnish archipelago. When the Winter War broke out on 30 November 1939, she was stationed in Högsåra with the submarines and coastal defence ships \"Väinämöinen\" and \"Ilmarinen\". After three Soviet scout planes flew over the ships, the fleet moved hastily to another safe location near Nagu only hours before eight four-engined enemy bombers overflew the previous anchorage. During the first weeks of the war, \"SuomenJoutsen\" was assigned to \"moving supply depot\" under the Archipelago Sea Fleet that consisted of the full rigged ship and a number of barges and tugboats. She served in this task until the Winter War ended with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. During the Interim Peace she was stationed in Naantali.\n\nWhen the Continuation War started on 25 June 1941, \"SuomenJoutsen\" resumed her old tasks as a moving supply depot under the Archipelago Sea Fleet. Since the Finnish Navy now had a dedicated submarine tender, icebreaker \"Sisu\", the former school ship was relegated to supply motor torpedo boats. After the war ended on 19 September 1944, \"SuomenJoutsen\" was used as an accommodation ship in Turku.\n\nDuring the war, around 150 men were stationed on \"SuomenJoutsen\". The ship was lightly armed with only two machine guns and around 40 rifles. She survived the war largely intact, with only minor shrapnel damage from Soviet air raids.\nAfter the war, \"SuomenJoutsen\" participated in the demining of the Finnish coastal waters, for which purpose she was fitted with an engine repair shop and a sauna for the crews of the minesweepers. She served in this task until the mine clearance was finished in 1948, but was afterwards used as an accommodation and supply ship for different branches of the Finnish Navy. In 1955–1959 she was stationed in Upinniemi.\n\nWhile \"SuomenJoutsen\" served as a supply ship for the minesweeping fleet, her crew rebuilt the rigging dismantled before the war and the school ship spent a couple of days sailing in the Baltic Sea in late 1948. Although there were plans to reactivate her as a school ship for either the Finnish Navy or the Finnish Merchant Fleet, or both, there were issues with her naval ensign — as a naval school ship she would not be allowed to carry cargo or be crewed by civilians, but a civilian flag would force her to pay expensive harbour fees. There was also no longer need for a civilian full rigged school ship. In 1949–1951, \"SuomenJoutsen\" conducted a number of short training and promotional sailings in the Baltic Sea, but never ventured further than the southern tip of Gotland.\n\nAlthough everything was ready for the first post-war school sailing, President J. K. Paasikivi was against the voyage — sailing a full rigged ship so soon after the war while the Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union were still being paid was deemed too flamboyant. It was Paasikivi who, as the director of the Finnish Export Society in the 1930s, had been one of the major supporters of \"SuomenJoutsen\". The danger of stray naval mines had also not completely disappeared. In 1961, the Finnish Navy purchased HMS \"Porlock Bay\", a \"Bay\" class frigate, as the new school ship.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Finnish Seamen's Union proposed the Finnish government that \"SuomenJoutsen\" should be turned into a stationary seamen's school. As nothing happened, the Union renewed its proposal with a different tone in the late 1950s when it learned that the government was planning to sell the old full rigged ship for German scrap dealers and, in fact, the first payment had already been made. The Union gave its ultimatum on 29 April 1959 and when the government did not react, the crews of the inspection ships under the Finnish Maritime Administration went on a strike on 2 May. Before the action could spread, the government acceded and it was agreed that \"SuomenJoutsen\" would be stationed in Turku. However, due to intentional delays nothing happened until Niilo Wälläri, the leader of the Finnish Seamen's Union, presented his final ultimatum on 13 January 1960: if the preparations to turn \"SuomenJoutsen\" into a seamen's school did not begin immediately, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers would go into strike on 15 January, effectively stopping all foreign trade. Two days later, icebreaker \"Sampo\" began towing the former school ship through the icefields towards Turku, where the convoy arrived on 17 January 1960. This was also one of the last missions of the old steam-powered icebreaker before she was decommissioned and sold for scrap.\n\n\"SuomenJoutsen\" was rebuilt again in 1960–1961 and most of her interior was converted into classrooms, workshops and student accommodation — only the captain's salon remained in its original shape. Two new classrooms were also built on the deck, slightly altering the appearance of the vessel. The first classes were held on 1 March 1961, and on 4 May the school was officially opened. On the same day, the naval ensign was replaced with the civilian flag.\n\n\"SuomenJoutsen\" served as a seamen's school for 27 years, during which time 3,709 students received their basic training on board the full rigged ship. In the 1980s, the facilities on board the school ship were becoming too small and increasingly obsolete, and there were talks about closing the school by the end of the decade. There was also discussion about turning \"SuomenJoutsen\" to a museum ship. The school closed its doors in 1988 and three years later \"SuomenJoutsen\" was handed over to the city of Turku.\n\n\"SuomenJoutsen\" has been open to the public since 1991. She is one of the largest museum ships in Finland, slightly shorter but bigger by gross register tonnage than the four-masted barque \"Pommern\" in Mariehamn, Åland, and considerably bigger than the wooden barque \"Sigyn\" which is moored next to her. \"SuomenJoutsen\" was moved from her original location next to Forum Marinum in 2002. Her extensive renovations since the late 1990s included drydockings in 1998 and 2006. Since 2009 she has hosted a permanent exhibition about her career.\n\nOn 25 July 2001, \"Suomen Joutsen\" received minor damage when the 1938-built steamer \"Ukkopekka\" collided with the museum ship. However, the damaged shell plating and frame were above the waterline, so the ship was in no danger of sinking.\n\nIn 2006 Pekka Koskenkylä, the founder of Nautor, revealed that the \"Swan\" line of luxury sailing yachts was named after \"Suomen Joutsen\".\n\nIn September 2016, \"Suomen Joutsen\" was towed to Turku Repair Yard for drydocking. After inspection and maintenance of the underwater parts, which is typically done once in a decade, the museum ship should be good for another ten years. The ship returned to Forum Marinum in late October.\n\nDuring her time as the school ship of the Finnish Navy, \"SuomenJoutsen\" carried out eight long sailing voyages in 1931–1939. Although her rigging was refitted for sailing after the Second World War, she was only used for short voyages in the Baltic Sea until her retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exhibition prepared by the Finnish Export Society was carried on three voyages.\n\n\"SuomenJoutsen\" is a steel-hulled full rigged ship with three square rigged steel masts. Both main mast and bow mast have six yards, the longest ones being long and weighing four tons, while the mizzenmast has five yards. The height of her main mast, which consists of three parts, is from the waterline. The sail area of \"SuomenJoutsen\" is and three sets of sails, each weighing three tons, were carried on training voyages. Her standing and running rigging consist of over of manilla ropes and steel cables. The typical sailing speed of \"SuomenJoutsen\" was around , but once in the North Sea she reached a record speed of with only topsails and the foresail.\n\nThe overall length of \"SuomenJoutsen\" is . Her hull is long at the waterline, has a beam of at midship and depth of to main deck. When she was carrying cargo, her tonnage was 2,393 register tons gross, 1,734 register tons net and 3,100 tons deadweight. The ship drew of water when loaded, but as a school ship she sailed with a ballast draft of only . With 1,200 tons of stones as sailing ballast, her displacement was 2,900 tons and metacentric height . Later some of the stone ballast was replaced with concrete and iron. Internally her hull was divided into five watertight compartments.\n\nWhen \"SuomenJoutsen\" was converted to a school ship for the Finnish Navy, her general arrangements were changed considerably in order to accommodate up to 180 men on long international voyages. In addition to living quarters, bathrooms and toilets, this included building kitchens and six refrigerated rooms for provisions, workshops for a carpenter, shoemaker and tailor, laundry room, hospital with ten beds and a small isolation ward, classroom, library, canteen, and more storage space for sails, ropes, paint, sand and coal. Nine freshwater tanks with a total capacity of 206 tons were also built, but in order to conserve water a traditional Finnish sauna was not provided. Instead, hot steam could be diverted into the washing rooms under the forecastle.\n\nOriginally built without auxiliary propulsion, \"SuomenJoutsen\" was refitted with two Skandia hot bulb engines, each producing 200 hp, coupled to three-bladed fixed pitch propellers. The twin-shaft propulsion arrangement was very uncommon at that time. In practice the engines were found out to be underpowered, but they could still be used to assist manoeuvering in ports and in heavy weather. Two generators (5 kW and 8 kW) were added to produce electricity for about three hundred lights. While \"SuomenJoutsen\" had a steam boiler for central heating, she did not have steam winches — anchors and yards were lifted using a manual capstan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944218", "title": "Mr. Mistoffelees", "text": "Mr. Mistoffelees\n\nMr. Mistoffelees is a character in T. S. Eliot's 1939 poetry book \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\" and its 1981 musical adaptation, Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Cats\". Mistoffelees is a young black-and-white tuxedo cat with magical powers that he cannot yet fully control. He is a featured dancer and his signature move is the \"Conjuring Turn\", consisting of 24 consecutive fouettés en tournant. His chorus identity is sometimes named Quaxo.\n\nThe role of Mr. Mistoffelees was originated by Wayne Sleep in the West End in 1981, and by Timothy Scott on Broadway in 1982. Jacob Brent portrayed the character in the 1998 film, while Laurie Davidson portrayed him in the 2019 film.\n\nMistoffelees' name derives from the demon Mephistopheles. However, the character is not sinister as the name implies, and instead is described by Eliot as being \"the original conjuring cat\", who is \"always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice\" — a mysterious, quiet and small black feline capable of performing feats of magic and sleight of hand. These traits are portrayed as amusing, not fearsome or particularly deadly.\n\nAlthough originally published as part of a collection of poems, \"Mr. Mistoffelees\" was published as a standalone book by Faber and Faber in 2015.\n\nIn \"Cats\", Mistoffelees is a principal role and maintains most of the same attributes as Eliot's original character, although he is a much flashier showman. He is portrayed as a young Jellicle cat who is not yet able to fully control his magical powers. As the most prominent male dancer, he usually serves as a counterpart to the lead female dancer, Victoria. Mistoffelees has his own titular song in the second act of the show, during which he performs an extended dance solo; the song is usually sung by him and Rum Tum Tugger. Mistoffelees's dance solo consists of some of the most difficult choreography in the show, including his signature \"Conjuring Turn\" that comprises 24 consecutive fouettés en tournant.\n\nIn most productions, Mistoffelees also sings the \"Invitation to the Jellicle Ball\" in the first act. In the original West End production, Mistoffelees also sang \"The Old Gumbie Cat\"; and in the original Broadway production, he sang \"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\", until the song was reworked to allow the two titular characters to sing it themselves. In some versions of the musical, his chorus identity is given a second name, \"Quaxo\".\n\nThe role is usually played by dancers with extensive ballet training. Because the role's technical demands necessarily trump the performer's vocal abilities, the show permits multiple vocal tracks for the character—thereby allowing some dancers to sing quite a bit, while others do no singing at all. In productions where Mistoffelees does sing, he is played by a high baritone.\n\nIn the 2019 film adaptation, however, the role has been significantly altered. Mistoffelees, depicted by Laurie Davidson, is more nervous and unsure of himself. He is shown to actually have magical powers, including being able to levitate objects and able to pull objects such as mice and flowers out of his hat. He saves Victoria from a dog when Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer abandon her in a house and becomes her love interest by the end of the film.\n\nAlthough Eliot's poem is specific about Mistoffelees's appearance being \"black from the ears to the tip of his tail\", the practicalities of stage costume mean he is usually portrayed as a black-and-white tuxedo cat, as a pure black costume would be completely lost under stage lighting. He wears two costumes, a basic black hatched leotard with white chest and fluffy warmers through the majority of the show. However, for his feature song, he has a more glamorous black velvet and rhinestone costume, with a black jacket fitted with electric flashing lights to make for a more spectacular entrance.\n\nThe role of Mr. Mistoffelees was originated by Wayne Sleep in the West End in 1981, and by Timothy Scott on Broadway in 1982. Actors who have portrayed Mistoffelees onstage include Louie Spence, Gen Horiuchi and George de la Peña. In the 1998 DVD production of the show, Mistoffelees is portrayed by Jacob Brent, reprising his Broadway role. In the 2016 Broadway revival the part was played by Ricky Ubeda.\n\nLaurie Davidson portrayed him in the 2019 film adaptation.\n\nIn 1980 the British actor Paul Nicholas released the song \"Magical Mr Mistoffelees\" as a single.\n\nWhen Neil Patrick Harris hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2009, Bobby Moynihan played Mr. Mistoffelees in a \"Save Broadway\" sketch.\n\n"}

During his career, Di Luca rode for the Riso Scotti, , , , , , and squads.\n\nDi Luca's career was also dogged by numerous infractions, involving three separate suspensions in relation to doping. In 2007, Di Luca was suspended for three months towards the end of the season, for visiting previously banned doctor Carlo Santuccione, which later escalated into the Oil for Drugs case. In 2009, at the Giro d'Italia, Di Luca tested positive on two different occasions for CERA, and was given a backdated – to July 2009 – two-year ban in February 2010, which was later reduced to nine months. His third positive test came just before the 2013 Giro d'Italia, when he tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO) in an out-of-competition test. Di Luca expressed surprise at the test results, but he was given a lifetime ban in December 2013.\n\nDanilo Di Luca wrote his autobiography \"Bestie da Vittoria\", which means \"Beasts for victories\". Such book is also a denunciation of the use of doping substances among cyclists and the use of anti-doping controls as a way to manipulate competition results.\n\nBorn in Spoltore, province of Pescara, Di Luca began his professional career in 1998 in the Riso Scotti team. He showed talent by winning the under-23 version of the Giro D'Italia. His first pro win was in 1999, when, moving to Cantina Tollo-Alexia Alluminio, he won the first stage of the Giro d'Abruzzo. He remained in the team taking wins in 2001 such as the fourth stage of the Giro d'Italia and the Giro di Lombardia. Then, he transferred to Saeco-Longoni Sport.\n\nDuring his time at Saeco-Longoni he lost the Vuelta al País Vasco on the last stage, a mountain time trial in which Andreas Klöden took the lead and the win. Combined with injuries and lack of confidence of the team directors, his performance suffered. In 2004 Italian officials investigated Di Luca for doping. Cyclingnews.com said: \"Di Luca was recorded in several phone conversations with Eddy Mazzoleni in which he allegedly talked about doping products, the investigation led to Di Luca's non-participation in the 2004 Tour de France.\"\n\nIn 2005, Di Luca switched to , with Mario Cipollini, Dario Cioni, Stefano Garzelli and Magnus Bäckstedt. He led the team for the spring classics. His first victory came in the first stage of the UCI ProTour race Vuelta al País Vasco, which he won overall after defeating Aitor Osa in the final time trial. He won the Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne, taking the ProTour leader's white jersey.\n\nDi Luca was seen as suited to races lasting only a few days. His success in the 2005 Giro d'Italia came as a surprise. Here he won two stages and finished fourth. He finished fifth in the Tour de Pologne. With a fourth in the 2005 Züri-Metzgete, he became 2005 UCI ProTour champion.\n\nDi Luca was forced to retire from the 2006 Tour de France, due to a urinary infection. He recovered to compete in the 2006 Vuelta a España, winning the fifth stage and holding the lead (ceding it to Janez Brajkovič). Di Luca's performances in the classics, the Giro, and other races, were a letdown from the triumphs of 2005.\n\nDi Luca won Milano–Torino in March and Liège–Bastogne–Liège in April. He took stages 4 and 12 en route to the victory in the 2007 Giro d'Italia. After the Giro, it was revealed that Di Luca had unspecified low hormone levels. Italian authorities are determining if they are a consequence of racing at a high level for three weeks or some kind of masking agent. On 28 September, Di Luca withdrew from the UCI road championship calling his treatment \"a scandal\" after doping allegations.\n\nDi Luca was leading the 2007 UCI ProTour when he was suspended before the final race, the Giro di Lombardia, due to alleged involvement in the Oil for Drugs case, for which he was suspended for three months through the close season.\n\nIn 2008, Di Luca had a quiet year as his new team, , were not invited to many races.

He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the UCI. He had been targeted for testing using information from his biological passport's blood profile, previous test results and his race schedule. On 8 August, his positive tests were confirmed. On 1 February 2010, the Italian Olympic committee (CONI) suspended him for two years (effective as of 22 July 2009) for the Giro doping incident. Di Luca must also pay a fine, as well as the costs incurred in both the analysis and counter-analysis of his Giro samples: Di Luca indicated his intention to contest the decision.\n\nOn 15 October 2010, CONI announced that Di Luca's ban had been reduced to nine months and seven days, allowing Di Luca to return as of that very day (though the season was nearly over). This was due to his reported cooperation with investigators, detailing doping methods. CONI also announced the reduction of Di Luca's fine, from €280,000 to €106,400, but the UCI contends that he will still have to pay the full amount based on when his doping incident occurred.

His first cousin King Hugh II of Cyprus died in 1267, and despite Hugh's rights as the senior heir, Hugh of Antioch, was crowned as Hugh III of Cyprus. When his second cousin's son Conradin, King of Jerusalem, was killed in 1268, the succession again went to the junior cousin Hugh III.\n\nHugh decided to seek his fortune in Europe rather than Outremer, and took service under Charles I of Naples. Charles made him Captain-General of Brindisi, Otranto and Apulia and Lord of Conversano, and he was an enthusiastic partisan of the Angevin cause in Italy. For this service, his family's County of Lecce was restored to him. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of the Gulf of Naples in 1284 with Charles II of Naples and again at the Battle of the Counts in 1287, both times in sea battles against Roger of Lauria. On one of these occasions, he obtained his parole by leaving his only son Walter as a hostage. He was killed in Sicily, at the Battle of Gagliano, fighting Catalan Almogavars, and was succeeded by Walter.\n\nIn 1291, he married Helena Angelina Komnene, the widow of William de la Roche, Duke of Athens, and regent for her underage son Guy II de la Roche. He thus became \"bailli\" of the Duchy of Athens until Guy II's coming of age in 1296.\n\nHugh's first wife was Isabella de la Roche, heiress of Thebes.

It was understood that the government was interested in producing beer for the local population as the beer produced by the inhabitants themselves caused major health problems. A brewery, which could brew a high quality beer, would improve the current situation. The investors decided to set up a brewery with the support of the “Société Congolaise de Banque”.

Menaechmus likely discovered the conic sections, that is, the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola, as a by-product of his search for the solution to the Delian problem. Menaechmus knew that in a parabola y = \"L\"x, where \"L\" is a constant called the \"latus rectum\", although he was not aware of the fact that any equation in two unknowns determines a curve. He apparently derived these properties of conic sections and others as well. Using this information it was now possible to find a solution to the problem of the duplication of the cube by solving for the points at which two parabolas intersect, a solution equivalent to solving a cubic equation.\n\nThere are few direct sources for Menaechmus's work; his work on conic sections is known primarily from an epigram by Eratosthenes, and the accomplishment of his brother (of devising a method to create a square equal in area to a given circle using the quadratrix), Dinostratus, is known solely from the writings of Proclus. Proclus also mentions that Menaechmus was taught by Eudoxus. There is a curious statement by Plutarch to the effect that Plato disapproved of Menaechmus achieving his doubled cube solution with the use of mechanical devices; the proof currently known appears to be purely algebraic.\n\nMenaechmus was said to have been the tutor of Alexander the Great; this belief derives from the following anecdote: supposedly, once, when Alexander asked him for a shortcut to understanding geometry, he replied \"O King, for traveling over the country, there are royal road and roads for common citizens, but in geometry there is one road for all.\" (Beckmann, \"A History of Pi\", 1989, p. 34) However, this quote is first attested by Stobaeus, about 500 AD, and so whether Menaechmus really taught Alexander is uncertain.\n\nWhere precisely he died is uncertain as well, though modern scholars believe that he eventually expired in Cyzicus.\n\n\n"}

The School is a member of the Rugby Group, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, and the Oxfordshire Independent and State School Partnership. Termly fees in 2019/2020 are £13,160 for boarding and £10,530 for day pupils. The school is also affiliated to the Church of England.\n\nThe School teaches the GCSE, A Level and International Baccalaureate (IB) qualifications. The Sixth Form is split evenly between pupils studying A Levels and the IB Diploma.\n\nThe School was founded in 1863 by the Rev. Thomas Chamberlain, student of Christ Church and vicar of St Thomas the Martyr. The original school building was Mackworth Hall, which then stood on New Inn Hall Street in central Oxford.\n\nIn 1873, after a storm damaged the school buildings and in anticipation of growing numbers, the Rev. A. B. Simeon, first Warden, moved the school to Summertown. At the time, the site was on the boundary of Oxford and surrounded by farmland, and Rev. Simeon bought a large plot for the school. The school remains on the site today, with the Quadrangle and playing fields on opposite sides of Woodstock Road.\n\nSimeon created a private school with monastic-style buildings around a quadrangle. St Edward's is the second largest quadrangle in Oxford, second only to Tom Quad at Christ Church. The original buildings were designed by William Wilkinson. The north range was built in 1873 and 1886, the gatehouse in 1879, and the east range, including Big School and the library, in 1881. Wilkinson's most significant building at St Edward's is the chapel, built in 1876.\n\nIn the First World War more St Edward's pupils, \"pro rata\", went to serve their country than from any other independent school in the UK. In Chapel the names of those former pupils who had lost their lives on the front line were announced. The walls of the chapel are lined with plaques remembering those former pupils who died in the Boer War, First World War, Second World War and subsequent wars.\n\nThe School flourished under the guidance of Warden Henry Ewing Kendall from 1925 to 1954. In the 1930s, a subway was built underneath the Woodstock Road following the death of a pupil who was run over by a car. The subway was the first to be built in Oxford and is still used today.\n\nIn the Second World War air raid shelters were dug into the grass of the Quad. The School was presented with a stained glass window by the RAF at the end of the War in recognition of \"\"the superb contribution to the war effort made by former pupils of the School\"\". These included, among many others, Wing Commander Guy Gibson VC DSO&Bar DFC&Bar of 617 Squadron, who led 'The Dambusters', flying ace Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader CBE DSO&Bar DFC&Bar, and Adrian Warburton DSO&Bar DFC& Two Bars DFC(US), famous for his role in the defence of Malta. Pacifist inclinations during the 1970s and 1980s caused the window to be relocated, before it was put back on display in the Old Library. The window has since been moved again and can now be seen on display in the Warden's Dining Room. The school also has a scholarship fund to assist pupils whose parents are in the armed forces.\n\nIn 1982, the School admitted its first girl, who joined in the Lower Sixth. The 11th Warden, David Christie, brought about an enormous change to the School when he fully developed the idea of allowing girls to join for the last two years of School (known as the Sixth Form). Following the success of a co-educational Sixth Form, the whole School became fully co-educational in 1997. In 1999, Holly Branson, daughter of Sir Richard Branson, became the school's first ever female Head Prefect and Head of School.\n\nThere is a large mural in the school's Dining Hall that depicts life at St Edward's. Included in the painting are a number of the characters from The Wind in the Willows, written by former pupil Kenneth Grahame.\n\nThe School recently opened a new music centre. Opening to the pupils for the first time in January 2017, The Ogston Music School expands the musical repertoire of the School to new levels. The new facility features 20 practice rooms, seven ensemble rooms, the large Weston Recital Room, a rock room, the Fenton Recording Studio, and the Ferguson Sixth Form Music Library.\n\nIn 2016, the School announced a new building project to complete the School's main Quad, and in so doing complete the vision of St Edward's first Warden, the Rev. Algernon Simeon some 130 years after its first conception. Work for the new development began in the summer of 2018 and will provide the School with a new purpose-built Library, a spacious and flexible university-style Academic Centre, and a new Hall, with a capacity for 1,000 people. Designed by architect Nick Hardy (TSH Architects), the expected completion date of the first phase of this new development is during 2020. There are also plans in motion for a new boarding House, also with a view to completion in 2020.\n\nJuly 2007 marked the official opening of The North Wall Arts Centre. The centre was built on the site of the old school swimming pool, which was the oldest swimming pool in the country. The North Wall Arts Centre is run by Co-Artistic Directors Ria Parry and John Hoggarth, and is a producing theatre. The North Wall is central to the School, strengthening its links with the local community, which has been seen by many as vital given the current political debate on the charitable status of public schools.\n\nThe North Wall Arts Centre won several major architectural awards for its design, including a RIBA award.\n\nThe new Martyrs Pavilion, designed by architect John Pawson, was opened in 2009 and won the 2010 Oxford Preservation Trust award in the New Buildings category.\n\nThere are 13 boarding houses which are home to approximately 50–60 boys or girls. Each House is run by Housemaster or Housemistress who is a member of the teaching staff at the School and lives in accommodation within the House with their family. Each House also has a set of House Tutors who supervise prep (homework) during the week and also tutor members of the House. Each House also has a dedicated matron who looks after pupils' medical (and often social) needs.\n\nThe school has around 120-day pupils, a small proportion of the total. Day pupils are expected to be in school from 8.30am Monday to Saturday. During the week, they may choose to depart at 6.30pm, or to stay in school until 9.00pm so that they have supper, complete supervised prep, take part in extra-curricular activities and enjoy leisure time with their friends. On Saturdays, day pupils leave after afternoon sport or other commitments. The School does not have day houses: all day pupils have a room within a boarding house and in most cases have their own bed and wardrobe. This policy means that the school does not have a day/boarder divide. Teachers often do not know who is a day pupil and who is not.\n\nThe sports on offer for girls include hockey, netball, tennis and rowing, while the main sports offered for the boys include rugby, hockey, cricket and rowing, with football also an proving increasingly popular option. The School has over of playing fields in North Oxford.\n\nThe School has a regular fixture list against other major UK public schools. Some of the fixtures on the fixture list have been played on the same weekend each year for decades. In boys' sports the schools main rivals include Radley College and Marlborough College and in girls sports, Marlborough, Stowe, and Oundle School.\n\nIn rowing the school has won The Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta on four occasions. The only British schools to have won the event more than this are Eton College and St Paul's School, London. In 2013 the boys 1st VIII boat rowed in the fastest Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup final ever seen at Henley, chasing the holders Abingdon School down to within half a length. Both crews beat the existing course record, having dispatched other leading international schools on the way to the final. In 2014, the boys 1st VIII were again the losing finalists, this time to Eton in another very close race. Having won Henley events seven times, (including three years as winners of the now discontinued Special Race for Schools) and been the losing finalist seven times, St Edward's School is the third most successful boys' rowing school behind Eton College and Shrewsbury School. The school regularly provides rowers for Great Britain junior crews before going on to compete in the annual Oxbridge boat race or at Ivy League Universities.\n\nSt Edward's has seen several successful spells in hockey, which have included making the National Finals for both boys' and girls' hockey. The girls' hockey has been particularly strong and teams are frequently County Champions. In 2013/14 the school had both boys and girls in Regional, National and Great Britain squads. In 2010 the boys' hockey 1st XI won the inaugural Charlie Barker Trophy, a competition between local rival schools including Radley College, Eton College, Marlborough College, Abingdon School and Cheltenham College and finished the season unbeaten. Most recently, in 2018 the girls' U16 and U14 sides won their County tournaments with the 1st XI also progressing to the Regional tournament.\n\nThe 1st XV enjoyed a successful season in 2017, winning 10 matches and losing two, finishing 13th in The Daily Mail Trophy. 2017 was a good year for St Edward's further down the age-groups too, with the Junior Colts A (U15) and Junior Colts B XVs both recording seasons of 10 wins from 11 matches. In 2018, the 1st XV were crowned County Champions for Oxfordshire after beating Cokethorpe School in the final. There are some six former or present pupils in their respective age group's England development squads/teams including James Forrester. The school enjoys a strong reputation in Rugby Sevens participating in tournaments throughout the school's Spring Term. Smaller in number than many of their rivals, they frequently punch above their weight, aided by strong coaching throughout the school.\n\nCricket has been particularly strong in recent years and St Edward's has developed something of a reputation for success in the sport, culminating in the 2013 season, which was one of the most successful in the School's history for the 1st XI. It included victories over Radley College, Harrow, Uppingham School and Cheltenham College. In 2017, the 1st XI began the season with a historic win over Oxford MCCU in University Parks, going on to achieve 18 victories in the season - the second highest ever - the team was also crowned South Central T20 Champions. Former pupil AJ Woodland was announced as the Wisden School's Cricketer of the Year for 2016 and other accolades for current pupils included selection for England U17s, an England U19s Invitational XI, and a variety of representational and county sides. 2017 was the final season in charge for Master in Charge of Cricket Richard WJ Howitt, who broke the school's record for the number of victories as coach of the 1st XI in his final season, with a total of 170 wins between 2004 and 2017.\n\nThe School has many inter-house sporting events including the Steeplechase, and inter-house rowing, rugby, hockey, netball, squash, swimming and football, among others. The Steeplechase is the school's annual cross country race and is held once a year with the seniors running a race across Port Meadow the floodplain of the River Thames.\n\nFormer pupils of St Edward's are known as Old St Edward's, abbreviated to OSE. The Old St Edward's Society exists to maintain traditions and to promote the interests of the School, and to encourage mutual help between those who are and those who have been its members. It consists of past and present Wardens and members of the Masters' Common Room and all former pupils.\n\nThe society is run by a President and Secretary. Each year a new OSE President is elected. The OSE Society organise Special Gaudies for former pupils. Special Gaudies are held twice a year and are used as a means for former pupils to visit the school and see what has changed. The OSE Society also runs the very successful \"OSE Undergraduate Evenings\"; these evenings take place in notable university cities throughout the year, hosted by the Hon. Secretary.\n\nAll members of the society may wear the society tie, which is blue, with a gold cup and dagger on it. Former pupils are entitled to wear the Rhubarb Tie.\n\nNotable OSE include:\n\nNotable masters of the school include:\n\nThe school has built up links with a number of schools around the world, which include:\n\nThe school received a grant of arms in December 2017.\n"}

The story starts off by showing aspiring vocalist, Olivia King (Diana Ross) performing at small lounge in Atlanta, Georgia in 1981. As she takes a break from her performance she heads backstage to see her infant daughter, Kayla (Jayda Brown). A music executive approaches King at the bar and tells her she is talented and should move to the bigger market of New York City to fulfill her dreams. Olivia King initially denies his request and goes home to her husband (Brian Stokes Mitchell). King is shown trying to explain her night to her husband and tell him about the music executive but he brushes her off and tells her moving to New York City is a bad idea. Feeling depressed, conflicted and trapped in her marriage, Olivia King leaves her home in the middle of the night whispering to her daughter that she can't take her along, but will be back for her.\n\nThe movie then picks back up in St. Louis, Missouri, 18 years later, and it is shown that Kayla Harris (Brandy Norwood), now 19 years old, has won a contest to meet famous superstar Olivia King. Kayla at this time does not know that Olivia is her mother, but she grew up being a huge fan of Olivia King and is extremely excited to meet her idol, completely ignorant to the truth. After enjoying the concert, Kayla then gets the second part of her prize which includes having dinner with Olivia King. At dinner, Kayla lets Olivia know that she also would like to be a singer and invites Olivia to a small performance she would be doing. When Kayla gets home from dinner, her father asks her how it went and he is shocked to hear that the star Kayla got to meet was Olivia King, though he knows the truth he does not press the issue further as he sees his daughter is still in the dark. Next, Kayla is shown getting ready to perform, and she begins to worry that Olivia will not show up but sure enough Olivia shows up as Kayla starts to sing. Kayla is ecstatic that her idol has shown up but after the show Olivia pulls her aside and reveals to Kayla who she really is. Kayla is stunned, upset, and quickly leaves. Kayla is shaken, argues with her father, and refuses to speak to Olivia even when she offers to help her with her career. Kayla's best friend advises her to accept Olivia's help with her music career as it is the least she owes her.\n\nKayla reluctantly agrees to go to New York City with Olivia all the while Olivia continues to make futile attempts to build a relationship with Kayla. Olivia introduces Kayla to the people she knows in the industry, and with Olivia's strong recommendation and Kayla's talent, she is quickly signed. Kayla begins to work on her album and with Olivia's guidance and leadership she records her first song. As the story progresses, the two ladies continue living in Olivia's fancy penthouse apartment with Olivia trying not to step on Kayla's toes as she pursues success. Kayla then finds a steamy romance with a handsome older music executive, Ric Ortega (Allen Payne) whom her mother does not trust and warns her against, but Kayla ignores her mother's warning. Despite her growing success and hit single, Kayla continues to harbor bitter feelings towards Olivia, feelings which boil over during their record label's Grammy Party. After Kayla's performance, Olivia is asked to perform by the head of the label, causing Kayla to resent her mother for \"stealing her spotlight\". However, after discovering that Ric revealed her true parentage to the press and betrayed her just as her mother had warned, Kayla dissolves her relationship with him. Kayla, feeling down and regretful, heads up to her mother's cabin where Olivia is finding refuge. As they spend time at the cabin and truly communicate the two women begin to understand each other. Eventually, Kayla's feelings about her mother change and she begins to accept the truth about her mother and the events that took place when she was younger. The movie culminates with Olivia and Kayla going back to St. Louis for a concert Kayla is giving. Kayla sings her songs but as the show draws to an end she calls on her mother to come up on stage with her and they sing a wonderful duet together. Kayla's friend and family look on from the audience.\n\nThe movie was a Nielsen ratings success, debuting at #16 for the week.

Davies started his career at Peterborough United before playing for Premier League clubs Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and Fulham, earning a runner-up medal during the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League with Fulham. Davies made more than 350 appearances at senior club level in England, along with earning 58 caps for the Welsh national team.\n\nBorn in Haverfordwest, Davies grew up in nearby Solva and played locally as a junior for Solva AFC, before becoming a trainee at Norwich City and then moving to Peterborough United at the age of 15. After graduating from the side's academy system, he quickly established himself as a first team player with the club, amassing over 50 first team appearances before he turned 20.\n\nAt the end of the 98/99 season he was named in the Division Three team of year, and as Peterborough's player of the year.\n\nAfter a trial with Manchester United in July 1999, Davies' performances for Peterborough encouraged Tottenham Hotspur manager George Graham to spend £700,000 to take him, along with fellow winger Matthew Etherington, to White Hart Lane on 31 December 1999.\n\nDavies made his Spurs debut on 9 April 2000 during a 2–0 defeat against Liverpool.\n\nDavies spent the early months of the 2000–01 season as a substitute.

The move meant that Davies received his first chance to play in Europe's premier football competition, the UEFA Champions League. On the whole, Davies had a poor first season in Everton's disappointing 2005–06 campaign. He did, however, score a winning goal at Birmingham City to give Everton their first win in over two months, a result which prompted a change in fortunes for the Merseysiders.\n\nIn January 2007, he left Everton for Fulham, for an undisclosed fee. He was brought in as the long-term replacement for Steed Malbranque on the right side of midfield. On 30 January 2007, he played his first Premier League match for Fulham against Sheffield United.\nSince joining Fulham from Everton, he became a mainstay on the right hand side of midfield contributing with some spectacular goals (free kick against Sunderland and full volley against Reading) and great crosses. His pace, along with his high work rate made him a crowd favourite and earned him the respect of then-manager Lawrie Sanchez. Davies was voted Fulham's player of the season in 2007–08.\n\nDavies scored a dramatic equaliser in the second leg of Fulham's UEFA Europa League semi-final against Hamburg on 29 April 2010; Fulham went on to win the game and the tie 2–1. He followed that up with a volleyed goal in the first half of the final against Atlético Madrid in Hamburg that made the score 1–1, although Fulham went on to lose 2–1 in extra time.\n\nDavies signed a new deal with Fulham on 16 August 2010 that saw him playing for the club until 2013. However, Davies later career at Fulham faded after suffering injuries. This first occurred when he suffered a knee injury, which lead Davies sidelined for five months following surgery. Four months later, on 10 December 2011, Davies made his first start of the 2011/12 season, in a 2–0 loss against Swansea City. Davies went on to make six appearances before suffering a hip injury. Davies was told by Manager Martin Jol will only be a bit-part player to make way for youngsters ahead of the 2012–13 season.\n\nDespite being included in the club's Premier League squad, Davies played his first match in the club's reserve match in a 2–2 against Wycombe Wanderers reserve team. Davies was one of 12 players released by Fulham at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season.\n\nIn July 2013, he returned to his boyhood club, Solva AFC, and played 40 minutes in a game against St Ishmael's at Maes-y-Mor. He formally signed for the amateur Pembrokeshire League Division Two club in September 2014, paying £3 per game 'subs' for the privilege.\n\nDavies made his debut for Wales in a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine on 6 June 2001, and scored his first goal against Croatia on 21 August 2002. Arguably, his best performance for his country came on 16 October 2002 when he scored the team's opening goal in a 2–1 victory over Italy.\n\nDavies played for Wales 58 times and scored six goals, captaining his country during their 2010 World Cup qualifiers and he was Welsh Footballer Of The Year in 2002.\n\nHe announced his retirement from international football on 9 August 2010.\n"}

Previously joint ventured with Sony Music, it is now totally independent. It was formed by Alan Wills, the former drummer with Liverpool bands Shack and Top. \n\nAiming to be like Mo'Wax, Wills started his first label EVA in January 2000, primarily to release material by Joe Fearon a.k.a Paracruzar. However, after three promo-only releases on clear 10-inch vinyl, including the first release by 'Mountaineers' (credited on the record as 'The Sandpeople'), he decided to move on to new areas and, with the help of his partner Ann Heston and consultancy from Simon Duffy (Tri Tone), he started a new label called Deltasonic Records. The name is an amalgamation of two ideas, as Wills explains: \"I predominantly wanted it to be a guitar label and the guitars we liked are rooted in the blues, so Delta, and Sonic is from Sonic Youth, just the coolest band name ever.\"\n\nThe discovery of The Coral gave Wills the impetus to bring his idea of a new guitar-band label to life by starting Deltasonic. Wills told HitQuarters that: \"It was always the aim to release them through Deltasonic, and it was always their aim to be on Deltasonic ... Most people wouldn't have understood the Coral at that point.\"\n\nThe label originally had a joint venture deal with Sony, with the major record company owning 49% of Deltasonic and using its network to distribute and market it releases worldwide. The partnership was a gamble for Sony that was motivated by chairman Rob Stringer and president Muff Winwood's love of the label's roster, and their belief that guitar music was on the rise.\n\nThe first single released was by The Coral. Other bands later signed to the label include Mountaineers (who later moved on to Mute records), the Zutons, The Dead 60's, The Little Flames, The Rascals, The Basement Candie Payne, and their first long-term signing from outside Liverpool, The Longcut followed by The Suzukis.\n\nDeltasonic is also a publishing company, and had success in 2009 with Miles Kane, and The Last Shadow Puppets #1 album, \"The Age of the Understatement\".\n\nAs a fully independent record label, Deltasonic's first album release for 2010 was by The Suzukis.\n\nIn May 2014, Alan Wills was killed in a cycling accident at the age of 52. The label however, would still continue.\n\nDeltasonic has continued and focuses on managing and developing new artists. With Ann Heston at the helm assisted by a team of young upcoming managers, and Joe Fearon as A&R consultant, Deltasonic re-emerged as one of the key independent UK labels and one of the few who develop young artists from ground level. 2015 saw the release of the debut album from The Little Flames and a series of reissues from the Deltasonic catalogue including The Dead 60s, Candie Payne, and The Basement. 2016 had releases from the latest Deltasonic artists; The Vryll Society, Hidden Charms, Psycho Comedy, and Tom Low.\n\n\n\n"}

Generally well received by critics, the album's sound was characterised by acoustic guitars, but also featured accordion, marimba, strings, and trumpet sounds. The album reached No. 35 on the UK Albums Chart. A single from the album, \"Good Thing\", reached No. 7 on the UK Indie Chart.\n\nThe band then became more experimental and frenetic when playing live, using more electronic sounds. This first became apparent as documented on the live album \"Live Hypno Beat\" (1987), which was recorded in Los Angeles in 1986. The band also started to become more 'raw' and unpredictable live, becoming one of the most exciting independent groups from the UK, while gaining an early hit on the burgeoning club scene in Ibiza with '\"Why\".\n\nIn 1987, Thompson left to be replaced by Anne Stephenson of The Communards. The more experimental mood continued on the second album \"Wooden Foot Cops on the Highway\", released the following year, which failed to live up to the expectations set by their debut. Most notably, the listeners of Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM voted their song \"Stop This Car\" number 15 out of 106 in the KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1988, outperforming many more established acts, and one of the album's standout tracks, \"Wheels Turning\", became a dancefloor favourite.\n\nThe Woodentops continued to play live, touring the world until 1992, and tracks such as \"Tainted World\" became a regular on New York radio station Kiss FM with DJ Tony Humphries.\n\nVocalist and guitarist Rolo McGinty, who also wrote all Woodentops' songs, resurfaced with the DJ band Pluto in the 1990s, the Dogs Deluxe electronica project and also provided vocals for Gary Lucas's \"Gods and Monsters\". Guitarist Simon Mawby was briefly a member of The House of Love in the early 1990s.\n\nThe Woodentops returned to live performances in September 2006 and, in October 2009, they performed in a special concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London's South Bank. They also curated the events in the Front Room of the same theatre with an exhibition of works by artist Panni Bharti, and concerts by musicians Worm, Othon and Ernesto Tomasini.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Sommeromys and was described by Musser & Durden in 2002.\n\n\"S. macrorhinos\" is known from only one specimen, AMNH 226956 (American Museum of Natural History, catalogue number 226956). This specimen was caught at 2400 m above sea level on Gunung Tokala, a mountain between the Rampi and Seko valleys in the province of Sulawesi Tengah, in primary mossy forest which was somewhat disturbed by human activities. The describers expected that the genus also occurs in other high montane forests of Sulawesi.\n\nIt is also found on Mount Gandangdewata, West Sulawesi.\n\nOn the first of August, 1973, the NAMRU team that would discover \"S. macrorhinos\" reached Gunung Tokala. Despite a heavy, cold rain, someone set some Victor rat traps and found one specimen each of \"Tateomys rhinogradoides\" and \"S. macrorhinos\" the following day. On the specimen of \"S. macrorhinos\", a louse was found, which was also a new species, \"Hoplopleura sommeri\".\n\nSommer's Sulawesi rat was named after Helmut G. Sommer, Scientific Technician at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSommer's Sulawesi rat is extremely small and has a long muzzle and an extremely long tail, both absolutely and relatively. It mainly feeds on insects. The stomach of the only known specimen contained some nematodes, fly eggs, and fragments of insects. Species of \"Bunomys\", \"Paruromys\", and \"Taeromys\" do not share the diagnostic characteristics of \"Sommeromys\" and are larger. \"Haeromys\" species are smaller (head-body 62–78 mm, tail up to 133 mm). \"Lenomys\" and \"Eropeplus\" species are much bigger (up to 301 and 255 mm, respectively), and have a tail which is as long as head-body (\"Lenomys\") or somewhat longer (\"Eropeplus\"). \"Margaretamys\" species are somewhat larger (96–197 mm). \"Echiothrix\" is much larger (up to 225 mm), has a prolonged muzzle and prolonged rostra and a bicolored tail (up to 258 mm). \"Melasmothrix\" has a dark chestnut fur, a short tail and paws and long claws. \"Tateomys rhinogradoides\" is larger, with a dark, brownish grey pelage, robust hind feet, and a long tail. \"T. macrocercus\" is smaller than \"T. rhinogradoides\", has a similar fur colour, but has an extremely long tail, long hind feet and narrow but long claws on the hind feet. \"Crunomys celebensis\" has a shorter and broader rostrum.\n\nMeasurements (all in mm):\nAccording to the discoverers, \"S. macrorhinos\" is a member of the so-called \"Old Endemics\n\" of Sulawesi and the Philippines. It is especially related to \"Crunomys\", which lives on both Sulawesi and the Philippines and the Philippine \"Archboldomys\". The \"Melasmothrix\"-\"Tateomys\" group may also be related.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944381", "title": "Falling film evaporator", "text": "Falling film evaporator\n\nA falling film evaporator is an industrial device to concentrate solutions, especially with heat sensitive components. The evaporator is a special type of heat exchanger.\n\nIn general evaporation takes place inside vertical tubes, but there are also applications where the process fluid evaporates on the outside of horizontal or vertical tubes. In all cases, the process fluid to be evaporated flows downwards by gravity as a continuous film. The fluid will create a film along the tube walls, progressing downwards (falling) - hence the name.\n\nThe fluid distributor has to be designed carefully in order to maintain an even liquid distribution for all tubes along which the solution falls. A typical distributor is shown in Fig. 2; these distributors are usually called ferrules due to their concentric shape.\nIn the majority of applications the heating medium is placed on the outside of the tubes. High heat transfer coefficients are required in order to achieve equally balanced heat transfer resistances. Therefore, condensing steam is commonly used as a heating medium.\nFor internally evaporating fluids, separation between the liquid phase (the solution) and the gaseous phase takes place inside the tubes. In order to maintain conservation of mass as this process proceeds, the downward vapor velocity increases, increasing the shear force acting on the liquid film and therefore also the velocity of the solution. The result can be a high film velocity of a progressively thinner film resulting in increasingly turbulent flow. The combination of these effects allows very high heat transfer coefficients.\n\nThe heat transfer coefficient on the evaporating side of the tube is mostly determined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions of the film. For low mass flows or high viscosities the film flow can be laminar, in which case heat transfer is controlled purely by conduction through the film. Therefore in this condition the heat transfer coefficient decreases with increased mass flow. With increased mass flow the film becomes wavy laminar and then turbulent. Under turbulent conditions the heat transfer coefficient increases with increased flow.\n\nEvaporation takes place at very low mean temperature differences between heating medium and process stream, typically between 3 - 6K, therefore these devices are ideal for heat recovery in multi stage processes.\nA further advantage of the falling film evaporator is the very short residence time of the liquid and the absence of superheating of the same. Not considering the vapour separator, the residence time inside the tubes is measured in seconds, making it ideal for heat-sensitive products such as milk, fruit juice, pharmaceuticals, and many others.\n\nFalling film evaporators are also characterised by very low pressure drops; therefore, they are often used in deep vacuum applications.\n\nDue to the intimate contact of the liquid with the heating surface, these evaporators are sensitive to fouling from precipitating solids. Low liquid velocity at the inlet is usually not sufficient to perform an effective self-cleaning of the tubes. \nFalling film evaporators are therefore used in clean, non-precipitating liquids. A typical application, in chemical industry, is for concentration of caustic soda.\n\nFalling film evaporators have a number of advantages over their flooded evaporator counterparts.\n\nThey require a lower charge, as the entire shell (in the case of horizontal evaporators) or all the tubes (in the case of a vertical evaporator) need not be filled with liquid as a thin film is now used to cover the surfaces. In industries such as heating and air-conditioning this can save significant money due to the high costs of a refrigerant charge.\n\nFalling film evaporators also show improved heat transfer characteristics over their flooded counterparts, particularly in cases with low heat flux.\n\nA number of disadvantages exist, primarily being the comparable lack of understanding of falling film evaporators compared to flooded evaporators, particularly for horizontal falling film evaporators. Furthermore the fluid distribution for horizontal falling film evaporators is a challenge, as the performance is severely limited if an uneven distribution of film over the tubes is created.\n\nHorizontal falling film evaporators have a number of potential advantages over their vertical counterparts in the petrochemical industry, such as the ability to use tubes with external enhancements. ( Internally enhanced tubes are available for vertical falling film evaporators, but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling film evaporators is that if a corrosive or fouling liquid is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on the shell side. This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944384", "title": "English irregular verbs", "text": "English irregular verbs\n\nThe English language has many irregular verbs, approaching 200 in normal use—and significantly more if prefixed forms are counted. In most cases, the irregularity concerns the past tense (also called \"preterite\") or the past participle.\n\nThe other inflected parts of the verb—the third person singular present indicative in \"-[e]s\", and the present participle and gerund form in \"-ing\"—are formed regularly in most cases. There are a few exceptions: the verb \"be\" has irregular forms throughout the present tense; the verbs \"have\", \"do\", \"go\" and \"say\" have irregular \"-[e]s\" forms; and certain defective verbs (such as the modal auxiliaries) lack most inflection.\n\nThe irregular verbs include many of the most common verbs: the dozen most frequently used English verbs are all irregular. New verbs (including loans from other languages, and nouns employed as verbs) usually follow the regular inflection, unless they are compound formations from an existing irregular verb (such as \"housesit\", from \"sit\").\n\nIrregular verbs in Modern English typically derive from verbs that followed more regular patterns at a previous stage in the history of the language. In particular, many such verbs derive from Germanic strong verbs, which make many of their inflected forms through vowel gradation, as can be observed in Modern English patterns such as \"sing–sang–sung\". The regular verbs, on the other hand, with their preterites and past participles ending in \"-ed\", follow the weak conjugation, which originally involved adding a dental consonant (\"-t\" or \"-d\"). Nonetheless, there are also many irregular verbs that follow or partially follow the weak conjugation.\n\nFor information on the conjugation of regular verbs in English, as well as other points concerning verb usage, see English verbs.\n\nMost English irregular verbs are native, derived from verbs that existed in Old English. Nearly all verbs that have been borrowed into the language at a later stage have defaulted to the regular conjugation. There are a few exceptions, however, such as the verb \"catch\" (derived from Old Northern French \"cachier\"), whose irregular forms originated by way of analogy with native verbs such as \"teach\".\n\nMost irregular verbs exist as remnants of historical conjugation systems. When some grammatical rule became changed or disused, some verbs kept to the old pattern. For example, before the Great Vowel Shift, the verb \"keep\" (then pronounced /keːp/, slightly like \"cap\" or \"cape\" without the j-glide) belonged to a group of verbs whose vowel was shortened in the past tense; this pattern is preserved in the modern past tense \"kept\" (similarly \"crept\", \"wept\", \"leapt\", \"left\"). Verbs such as \"peep\", which have similar form but arose after the Vowel Shift, take the regular \"-ed\" ending.\n\nThe force of analogy tends to reduce the number of irregular verbs over time, as irregular verbs switch to regular conjugation patterns (for instance, the verb \"chide\" once had the irregular past tense \"chid\", but this has given way to the regular formation \"chided\"). This is more likely to occur with less common verbs (where the irregular forms are less familiar); hence it is often the more common verbs (such as \"be\", \"have\", \"take\") that tend to remain irregular. Many irregular verbs today have coexisting irregular and regular forms (as with \"spelt\" and \"spelled\", \"dreamt\" and \"dreamed\", etc.).\n\nIn a few cases, however, analogy has operated in the other direction (a verb's irregular forms arose by analogy with existing irregular verbs). This is the case with the example of \"catch\" given above; others include \"wear\" and \"string\", which were originally weak verbs, but came to be conjugated like the similar-sounding strong verbs \"bear\" and \"swing\".\n\nIn American English, the regular forms of verbs account for more than 90% of instances, whereas British English has a regular form frequency of 69% according to a 1991 study.\n\nThe verb forms described in this article are chiefly those that are accepted in standard English; many regional dialects have different irregular forms, such as American English \"sneak\"–\"snuck\" and \"dive\"-\"dove\" as opposed to standard \"sneaked\" and \"dived\" respectively. In particular, it is fairly common in some types of non-standard speech to use (standard) past tenses as past participles, and vice versa; e.g \"have went\" instead of \"have gone\" in Southern American English.\n\nThe irregular verbs of Modern English form several groups with similar conjugation pattern and historical origin. These can be broadly grouped into two classes – the Germanic weak and strong groups – although historically some verbs have moved between these groups. There are also a few anomalous cases: the verbs \"be\" and \"go\", which demonstrate suppletion; the verb \"do\"; and the defective modal verbs.\n\nMany irregular verbs derive from Germanic strong verbs, which display the vowel shift called ablaut, and do not add an ending such as \"-ed\" or \"-t\" for the past forms. These sometimes retain past participles with the ending \"-[e]n\", as in \"give–gave–given\" and \"ride–rode–ridden\", but in other cases this ending has been dropped, as in \"come–came–come\" and \"sing–sang–sung\". This verb group was inherited from the parent Proto-Germanic language, and before that from the Proto-Indo-European language. It was originally a system of regular verbs, and in Old English and modern German the system remains more or less regular; however in Modern English relatively few verbs continue to follow such a pattern, and they are classed as irregular.\n\nVerbs that retain a strong-type inflection in modern English and add \"-[e]n\" in the past participle include \"bear\", \"beat\", \"beget\", \"bite\", \"blow\", \"break\", \"choose\", \"cleave\", \"draw\", \"drive\", \"eat\", \"fall\", \"fly\", \"forbid\", \"forget\", \"forsake\", \"freeze\", \"give\", \"grow\", \"know\", \"lie\", \"ride\", \"rise\", \"see\", \"shake\", \"shear\", \"slay\", \"smite\", \"speak\", \"steal\", \"stride\", \"strive\", \"swear\", \"take\", \"tear\", \"throw\", \"tread\", \"wake\", \"weave\", and \"write\".\n\nThose that do not add \"-[e]n\" in the usual past participle include \"become\", \"begin\", \"bind\", \"burst\", \"cling\", \"come\", \"drink\", \"fight\", \"find\", \"fling\", \"get\" (but with past participle \"gotten\" in American English), \"grind\", \"hang\", \"hold\", \"let\", \"ring\", \"run\", \"seek\", \"shed\", \"shine\", \"shit\", \"shoot\", \"shrink\", \"sing\", \"sink\", \"sit\", \"slide\", \"sling\", \"slink\", \"slit\", \"spin\", \"spring\", \"stand\", \"sting\", \"stink\", \"strike\", \"swim\", \"swing\", \"win\", \"wind\" and \"wring\".\n\nThe verbs \"sow\" and \"swell\" are now usually regular in the past tense, but retain the strong-type past participles \"sown\" and \"swollen\". Other verbs retain participles in \"-n\" for certain adjectival uses, such as \"drunken\" and \"sunken\". The verb \"crow\" is now regular in the past participle, but the strong past tense \"crew\" is sometimes used.\n\nSome originally weak verbs have taken on strong-type forms by analogy with strong verbs. These include \"dig\", \"dive\" (when \"dove\" is used as the past tense), \"hide\", \"mow\", \"prove\" (when \"proven\" is used as the past participle), \"saw\" (past participle \"sawn\"), \"sew\" (past participle \"sewn\"), \"show\" (past participle \"shown\"), \"spit\", \"stick\", \"strew\", \"string\", and \"wear\" (analogy with \"bear\").\n\nFor indication of the groups of strong verbs the listed words belong to, see the table at List of English irregular verbs.\n\nSome other irregular verbs derive from Germanic weak verbs, forming past tenses and participles with a \"-d\" or \"-t\" ending (or from originally strong verbs that have switched to the weak pattern). The weak conjugation is also the origin of the regular verbs in \"-ed\"; however various historical sound changes (and sometimes spelling changes) have led to certain types of irregularity in some verbs. The main processes are as follows (some verbs have been subject to more than one of these).\n\nThe irregular weak verbs (being in normal use) can consequently be grouped as follows:\nFor weak verbs that have adopted strong-type past tense or past participle forms, see the section above on strong verbs. More information on the development of some of the listed verbs can be found at List of irregular verbs.\n\nThe following verbs do not fit exactly into any of the above categories:\n\nApart from the modal verbs, which are irregular in that they do not take an \"-s\" in the third person (see above), the only verbs with irregular present tense forms are \"be\", \"do\", \"have\" and \"say\" (and prefixed forms of these, such as \"undo\" and \"gainsay\", which conjugate in the same way as the basic forms).\n\nThe verb \"be\" has multiple irregular forms. In the present indicative it has \"am\" in the first person singular, \"is\" in the third person singular, and \"are\" in the plural and second person singular. (Its present subjunctive is \"be\", as in \"I suggest that you be extremely careful\", though that is not irregular, as all verbs use the infinitive/imperative form for the present subjunctive.) It also has two past tense forms: \"was\" for the first and third persons singular, and \"were\" for the plural and second person singular (although there are certain subjunctive uses in which \"were\" can substitute for \"was\"). The past participle is \"been\", and the present participle and gerund forms are regular: \"being\". For more details see Indo-European copula.\n\nAs mentioned above, apart from its other irregularities, the verb \"do\" has the third person present indicative \"does\" pronounced with a short vowel: .\n\nThe verb \"have\" has a contracted third person present indicative form: \"has\" (weak pronunciation ). This is formed similarly to the verb's past tense \"had\".\n\nThe verb \"say\" displays vowel shortening in the third person present indicative (although the spelling is regular): \"says\" . The same shortening occurs in the past form \"said\" . (Compare the diphthong in the plain form \"say\" .)\n\nFor shortened forms of certain verbs and of their negations (\"s\", \"re\", \"won't\", etc.), see English auxiliaries and contractions.\n\nIn regular English verbs, the past tense and past participle have the same form. This is also true of most irregular verbs that follow a variation of the weak conjugation, as can be seen in the list below. Differences between the past tense and past participle (as in \"sing–sang–sung\", \"rise–rose–risen\") generally appear in the case of verbs that continue the strong conjugation, or in a few cases weak verbs that have acquired strong-type forms by analogy—as with \"show\" (regular past tense \"showed\", strong-type past participle \"shown\"). However, even some strong verbs have identical past tense and participle, as in \"cling–clung–clung\".\n\nIn some verbs, the past tense, past participle, or both are identical in form to the basic (infinitive) form of the verb. This is the case with certain strong verbs, where historical sound changes have led to a leveling of the vowel modifications: for example, \"let\" has both past tense and past participle identical to the infinitive, while \"come\" has the past participle identical (but a different past tense, \"came\"). The same is true of the verbs listed above under as having undergone coalescence of final consonants (and without other irregularities such as vowel shortening or devoicing of the ending): \"bet\", \"bid\", etc. (these verbs have infinitive, past tense and past participle all identical, although some of them also have alternative regular forms in \"-ed\"). The verb \"read\" has the same spelling in all three forms, but not the same pronunciation for the past tense and past participle , as it exhibits vowel shortening.\n\nIn a few cases the past tense of an irregular verb has the same form as the infinitive of a different verb. For example, \"bore\" and \"found\" may be past tenses of \"bear\" and \"find\", but may also represent independent (regular) verbs of different meaning. Another example is \"lay\", which may be the past tense of \"lie\", but is also an independent verb (regular in pronunciation, but with irregular spelling: \"lay–laid–laid\"). In fact \"lay\" derives from a causative of the verb from which \"lie\" derives. The two verbs are sometimes confused, with \"lay\" used in the intransitive senses prescriptively reserved for \"lie\".\n\nNearly all of the basic irregular verbs are single-syllable words. Their irregular inflected forms are generally single-syllable also, except for the past participles in \"-en\" like \"chosen\" and \"risen\". However many additional irregular verbs are formed by adding prefixes to the basic ones: \"understand\" from \"stand\", \"become\" from \"come\", \"mistake\" from \"take\", and so on. As a general rule, prefixed verbs are conjugated identically to the corresponding basic verbs; e.g \"understand–understood–understood\" and \"become–became–become\", following the patterns of \"stand–stood–stood\" and \"come–came–come\". However, there are occasional differences: in British English, for instance, the past participle of \"get\" is \"got\", (as opposed to \"gotten\" as in North American English) while that of \"forget\" is \"forgotten\".\n\nOnly a few irregular verbs of more than one syllable cannot be analyzed as prefixed compounds of monosyllables. The only ones in normal use are \"begin–began–begun\" and \"forsake–forsook–forsaken\" (these both derive from prefixed verbs whose unprefixed forms have not survived into Modern English). There is also \"beseech–besought–besought\" (this is from Old English \"besēcan\" \"to seek or inquire about\", making it equivalent to \"be-\" + \"seek\", but it has moved away from \"seek\" in both form and meaning); however the form \"besought\" is now archaic, the verb normally being conjugated regularly (\"beseeched\").\n\nThe following is a list of 204 irregular verbs that are commonly used in standard modern English. It omits many rare, dialectal, and archaic forms, as well as most verbs formed by adding prefixes to basic verbs (\"unbend\", \"understand\", \"mistake\", etc.). It also omits past participle forms that remain in use only adjectivally (\"clad\", \"sodden\", etc.). For a more complete list, with derivations, see List of English irregular verbs. Further information, including pronunciation, can be found in Wiktionary. The list that follows shows the base, or infinitive form, the past tense and the past participle of the verb.\n\nSteven Pinker's book \"Words and Rules\" describes how mistakes made by children in learning irregular verbs throw light on the mental processes involved in language acquisition.

Prior to the dissolution of the colonies, the chief secretary was the second most important official in a colony of the British Empire after the Governor, typically termed the colonial secretary and often an office held by the premier or a similar politically elected minister, and with a portfolio which were equivalent to what was later termed the Home Secretary's office.\n\nThis office was at first known as \"colonial secretary\" or \"principal secretary.\" In all colonies in British North America (with the single exception of Prince Edward Island), the equivalent title was \"provincial secretary\". In Prince Edward Island, the term \"colonial secretary\" was used. \n\nOriginally the occupant of this post was secretary to the governor as well as secretary of the colony. In 1821, Governor of New South Wales Philip Gidley King wrote that the colonial secretary:\n\nIn Ireland, the role of chief secretary dated from 1660.\n\nThe colonial secretary in the Colony of New South Wales and most of the other Australian colonies during the nineteenth century was a political position and not the position of a civil servant. The colonial secretary was thus a government minister and politician, and the position was fundamentally equivalent to the later term \"home secretary\", and it was commonly (but not always) held by the colonial prime minister, later referred to as \"premier\". The function of colonial secretary and secretary to the governor were thus separated in 1824, and several Australian colonies renamed their 'colonial secretary' as 'home secretary' during the 1890s and just before separation.\n\nAfter the grant of responsible government, this office like its British equivalent, the First Lord of the Treasury was frequently the formal position held by the colonial premier because the office of premier was not mentioned in any legislation. The Cape Colony was unusual in giving the colonial secretary at the Cape responsibility for defence. Several of the Australian states and territories retained the title for many decades, the chief secretary's departments ultimately evolving into the modern Premier's Departments in those states, although the chief secretary position itself became separate from that of the Premier, and evolved differently in different jurisdictions: in some places it became the equivalent of the British Home Secretary or a Minister of the Interior elsewhere. New Zealand abolished the office in 1907.\n\nTerritories with chief secretaries included Nigeria, Kenya and Tanganyika. Smaller territories, like British Guiana, used the term \"colonial secretary\" instead.\n\n"}

It is the capital of the Kretinga district municipality. It is located east of the popular Baltic Sea resort town of Palanga, and about north of Lithuania's 3rd largest city and principal seaport, Klaipėda. It is part of the historic Memelland.\n\nThe population was listed as 21,421 in the 2006 census. It is the 6th largest town in the ethnographic region of Samogitia and the 17th largest town in Lithuania.\n\nKretinga is one of the oldest known towns in Lithuania. It was first mentioned in 1253 as castle of \"Cretyn\" under the charter of Bishop Heinrich of Courland.\n\nIn 1602 Jan Karol Chodkiewicz built the first wooden church in Kretinga and established a Benedictine monastery, which became a great success. After about ten years a new brick church with an impressive organ was built. In 1610 a church school was opened.\n\nIn 1609 Jan Karol Chodkiewicz announced that he would establish a new settlement next to the old village and would grant the new borough Magdeburg rights. The new borough adopted a coat of arms depicting the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Infant Jesus in her arms. Kretinga's patron saint remains the Blessed Virgin.\n\nIn 1621 the Sapieha family gained control of the city; they changed its coat of arms to represent Saint Casimir. In 1659 and 1710 the church and monastery were destroyed by Swedish armies. The Sapieha family helped to rebuild and improve it.\n\nIn 1720 the town came under the jurisdiction of the Massalski family. Ignacy Jakub Massalski opened a university preparatory school in 1774. The town lost its municipal rights after the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe town prospered during the 19th century as part of the Russian Empire. In 1882 the first telephone line in Lithuania connected Kretinga with Plungė and Rietavas. In 1875, Count Tiškevičius decided to establish his family estate in Kretinga; he purchased and rebuilt an old palace. Following the fashions of the Victorian era, the family landscaped it lavishly and built a greenhouse featuring exotic flowering plants and tropical fruits. In 1890 they installed electricity in the Manor House.\nDuring World War I, the Germans built a railway line connecting Bajorai, Kretinga, and the Latvian city of Priekule. In 1924 Kretinga regained its municipal rights. During the interwar period, the village of Kretingsodis, on the other side of the Akmena River, was incorporated into the borough. Kretinga gained greater importance after another railway line was built in 1932 that connected it to Šiauliai.\n\nDuring the first Soviet occupation, under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a reign of terror resulted in local residents being arrested and, in some cases, executed without trial or deported to Siberia. A local lawyer, Vladas Petronaitis, was arrested and ultimately tortured to death by the Soviet intelligence agency.\n\nDuring World War II, the Nazi occupation saw the elimination of Kretinga's Jewish population. In June 1941, German forces and Lithuanian collaborators took about 200 Jewish men and some Lithuanian communist activists to a forest outside the town and shot them in pits that some of the Jewish men had been forced to dig. Several more mass shootings including women and children took place in July at the Kretinga Jewish cemetery. As in neighbouring Palanga, local Lithuanian nationalists volunteered to assist in the killing of Jewish citizens as soon as the German army and police units had arrived. \n\nThe Soviet occupation in 1945 led to further reductions in the population as refugees fled to the west and many of those trapped were deported to Siberia.\n\nThe local economy stagnated under Soviet occupation, which forcibly collectivized the farms in the area; it became an economic backwater.\n\nSince Lithuania's independence in 1990, the town has made a recovery; it has much to offer by way of history and art. Kretinga hosts folk music festivals, theatricals, the Kretinga Festival, celebrations on Midsummer Night's Eve (\"Joninės\") and Mardi Gras (\"Užgavėnės\"), and a Manorial Feast. The Manor House is now a museum housing artistic and archeological collections and a restaurant in the adjacent greenhouse, called \"The Winter Garden\". A Cambrian geothermal reservoir underlies the area, and the Vydmantai powerplant exploiting this resource is being built nearby.\n\nIts Kretinga Jurgis Pabrėža gymnasium was founded in 1980.\n\n\nKretinga is twinned with:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944391", "title": "Four Inns Walk", "text": "Four Inns Walk\n\nThe Four Inns Walk is a hiking event held annually over the high moorlands of the Northern Peak District. It takes place mainly in Derbyshire (though it starts in Yorkshire and, near the end, makes a short detour into Cheshire), in northern England. It is organised by the Scout Association. It is a competitive event, without an overnight camp (although teams must be equipped to bivouac if the conditions are severe enough to warrant it). It was first held as a Rover Scout event in 1957, but is now open to other teams of experienced hill walkers and fell runners.\n\nThe event is undertaken in teams of three or four, for safety reasons, and at least two of these team members must be at least 17 (the others may be 16) on the day of the event. An amount of equipment must be carried by the team, including survival bags, emergency rations, a first-aid kit, and a group shelter. Any member of a team is allowed to drop out at any point, but the rest of the team will not be permitted to continue the event unless they are in a group of not less than 3, or more than 7 people (which can be formed by combining two groups together). The remaining team members must still carry all of the safety equipment. Any team that has not reached the checkpoint at Chapel-en-le-Frith before 21:15 will not be allowed to complete the rest of the event. No dogs are allowed to accompany the walkers.\n\nThe 40-mile (65 km) hike starts at the local church of Holmbridge. The first of the 12 checkpoints is the derelict 'Isle of Skye' Inn, then the route heads south, crossing the flanks of Black Hill. Next, it passes through Hey Moss, Crowden, Tor Side, Bleaklow, and Doctor's Gate to the 'Snake (Pass) Inn'. The next checkpoint is over the Kinder plateau to the 'Nag's Head' Inn in Edale. The route then passes through Chapel-en-le-Frith, White Hall, and the Goyt Valley to the 'Cat and Fiddle' Inn, finally descending to Buxton for the finish.\nUsually, two thirds of the teams finish the event, in times between 8 and 16 hours (the course record of 6 hours 38 minutes was set in 2013). However, some teams take longer than this, and some have taken over 20 hours. At most of the checkpoints, hot drinks and sandwiches will be given to the competitors, and several Mountain Rescue teams are on hand to ensure their safety.\n\nA number of trophies are available for teams that complete the event. These are:\nThree Rover Scouts, aged 19, 21, and 24 died in the 1964 event. The youngest was a member of the 32nd Huddersfield (Dalton) Rover Crew. The two older were from the Birmingham University Rover Crew. Travelling lightly laden and without support, they were overtaken by deteriorating weather, including 30 mph winds, heavy rain, and temperatures from 0 to 7 °C above the Snake Pass. The youngest of the group got into trouble in the upper reaches of the Alport Valley. One of his team members summoned help and he was brought down to Alport Castles Farm by the Glossop Rover Crew. He was taken to hospital but died later. The other two scouts who died were in a separate team, but in the same area. A third member of that team was found in the Alport and taken to safety, but he was unable to give accurate information about where the rest of the team were. Because of the worsening weather, the search had to be called off during the night, but it was resumed on Sunday morning. However, it was not until Monday afternoon that the first body was recovered. By Tuesday, 370 people were involved with the search and the second body was recovered later that morning.(In that year, when the event fell in mid-March, only 22 of the initial field of over 240 finished).\nThere is a Memorial Tablet to the three Scouts in Holy Trinity Church, Edale, dedicated in a memorial service held on Sunday, 22 May 1966.\n\nAn MRC (Medical Research Council) respiration and metabolism project, devised to identify the metabolic and biochemical basis for this tragedy, was performed during the 1965 event, with young volunteers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1944402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944402", "title": "Peter Parler", "text": "Peter Parler\n\nPeter Parler (, , ; 1333 – 13 July 1399) was a German-Bohemian architect and sculptor from the Parler family of master builders. Along with his father, Heinrich Parler, he is one of the most prominent and influential craftsmen of the Middle Ages. Born and apprenticed in the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd, Peter worked at several important late Medieval building sites, including Strasbourg, Cologne, and Nuremberg. After 1356 he lived in Prague, capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and seat of the Holy Roman Empire, where he created his most famous works: St. Vitus Cathedral and the Charles Bridge.\n\nLittle is known about the earliest youth of Peter Parler. His father, Heinrich Parler the Elder, was a stonemason at Cologne Cathedral. Around 1333, when Peter was born, Heinrich was invited by the free imperial city of Schwäbisch Gmünd to take over construction of a large new parish church, Holy Cross Minster. Peter was already working alongside his father on the church when the cornerstone of the choir was laid in 1351. This is presumably also where his apprenticeship was completed. The division of the choir by a continuous balustrade demonstrates what would become his trademark style. The arched section at the southern portal of the church can also be attributed to Peter. The designs developed by the father and son team at Holy Cross were unique and mark an important milestone in late Gothic architecture and sculpture.\n\nPeter then set off on the so-called \"Wandering Years\" (), the Medieval German tradition of working as a travelling craftsman after completing apprenticeship. On these visits he learned the most important concepts of Gothic construction techniques in Central Europe. He visited Cologne, perhaps Paris, and certainly spent time in Strasbourg – precise knowledge of Strasbourg Cathedral can be seen in his subsequent buildings. While working in Cologne he met Druda (Gertrud), daughter of the resident architect Bartholomäus von Hamm. They eventually married and had four children: three sons, of which two went on to become known master builders in their own right, and a daughter.\n\nWhile undocumented, some scholars believe Parler traveled to England during this period, while others find the possibility unlikely. The idea arises because certain detailed and concealed technical devices appear in his later work which could have only been obtained through first-hand experience and not from any architectural drawings. What is definitely known is that masons at Strasbourg implemented specific craft methods from western England in the late 1200s, which points to knowledge of English Gothic architectural methods in the Rhineland. Since Peter Parler spent time working at Strasbourg, it is much more likely his knowledge of these methods came from there. In particular, the vaults he later designed at St. Vitus Cathedral were most probably modeled after the St. Catherine Chapel of Strasbourg Cathedral.\n\nSometime after 1352 Peter joined the construction works at the Frauenkirche in Nuremberg as the \"parlier\", or chief site assistant alongside his father. The exact date and his precise role are unclear. The foundations of the church had already been laid in 1351 on the initiative of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who envisioned it as a center for holding imperial ceremonies. This is reflected in the carved coats of arms of the Emperor, the seven Prince-electors, and the city of Rome where the Holy Roman Emperors were crowned. Here the first sculptures can be directly ascribed to Peter, among them a prominent figure of Zacharias.\n\nCharles also commissioned the building of Wenzelsburg Castle at Lauf an der Pegnitz, near Nuremberg. Built on the ruins of an older castle, its ambitious architecture can be directly connected to the Parlers and Peter probably worked there as a sculptor. By 1355 their sophisticated style had come to the attention of Charles IV and Peter was called to work in Prague, the capitol of the new Kingdom of Bohemia and seat of the Emperor. The year of this appointment is not entirely clear since the documentary inscription in Prague was partially painted over in the 15th century. Today research usually sets the date to 1356, which accounts for a pause in construction in both Nuremberg and Prague, as well as information that he was at least 23 years old at the time of his appointment.\n\nUpon his ascension to the throne as King of Bohemia in 1347, Charles IV established his capital at Prague. At the time it consisted of two autonomous Medieval towns on each side of the Vltava river (): the Old Town on the right and the Malá Strana with Prague Castle above it on the left. In 1348 he ordered construction of the New Town adjacent to the existing Old Town, founded Charles University, began reconstruction of the castle, and restarted work on the cathedral. To accomplish this ambitious building program he recruited the best architects he could find. First was Matthias of Arras, who died in 1352. When elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1355, Charles determined to make Prague the showcase capital of Central Europe and recruited Peter Parler to execute this grand vision. The period would launch what became known as Prague's \"golden era\" and it soon was the largest European city after Constantinople, Paris, and Granada.\n\nWhen Peter arrived in Prague in 1356 at the age of 23, his immediate assignment was to take over the construction site at St. Vitus Cathedral, which had languished since the death of Matthias of Arras in 1352. It is indicative of Peter's talents that the most important building in the Empire was then entrusted to such a young architect. Peter continued the works at St. Vitus from the ambulatory and chapels, which were partially complete, and gradually changed the Matthias plan while keeping continual references to the original vision.\n\nIn 1342, just prior to the reign of Charles IV, the Romanesque Judith Bridge across the Vltava was severely damaged in a flood. It had been the first stone bridge to connect each bank of the river. In 1357, Charles commissioned Peter to build a new structure to reconnect the growing city, now consisting of 4 districts. The first foundation stone was ceremonially laid in the presence of the Emperor on 9 July 1357 at 5:31 am. The exact time is known because the architect had the palindromic number 135797531 carved into the bridge's tower, having been chosen by the royal astrologists as the most auspicious for starting construction. Due to the complexity of the engineering project, and the large number of other projects underway, construction lasted until 1402.\n\nThe east tower of the Bridge, Old Town Bridge Tower, was also built by Peter Parler. Its arch contains a net vault that was the first of its kind in Bohemia.\n\nApart from the cathedral and the bridge, Peter was also the main designer of the New Town of Prague. He also built the \"All Saints' Chapel\" inside the Royal Palace of Prague Castle. After a fire in 1541 it was redecorated in the Baroque style. Between 1360–78 Parler built the chancel of the St. Bartholomew church in Kolín. Peter is also responsible for various tombs, shrines and sculptures at various sites in and around Prague, including at Kutná Hora.\n\nThe Parler family grew large and its many members worked at Gothic construction sites all over Central Europe and Northern Italy. Peter's branch of the family began with his marriage to his first wife, Gertrude. Although their wedding date is not exactly known, by 1360 they were raising three sons and a daughter:\n\n\nAfter 1360, Peter owned a house in Prague Castle Square and had been elected city alderman. His first wife Gertrude died in the late 1360s and he returned to Cologne to dispose of her inheritance in 1370. He then married Elisabeth Agnes von Bur in 1380 and in the same year bought a second house on Castle Square. From this marriage two more children were born: Johann, who possibly became a stonemason in Zagreb; and Paul, about whom no information survives. He may have had other children as well. The purchase of the houses, the marriage of his daughter, and the number of his children led to some legal disputes. Peter Parler is known to have relinquished both houses to his second wife and their children.\n\nPeter was granted citizenship in Prague in 1379. By his old age he had become a wealthy man and was still active as an architect. His name appears as Cathedral Master () on a panel at St. Vitus as late as 1396. He died in Prague in 1399 and was buried at St. Vitus Cathedral, with his sons Peter and Wenzel carrying on his work.\n\nPeter Parler was one of the most well-known and influential craftsman of the Middle Ages. The designs of both him and his father became known as the \"Parler style\" and spread throughout Central Europe. Significant examples include: St. Martin's Church, Landshut (begun 1389); St. Lorenz, Nuremberg (nave begun 1400); St. George's Minster, Dinkelsbühl (begun 1448); St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna (south tower begun 1368); and numerous other examples across the Hanseatic League from the Netherlands to Poland. Examples can also be found in Scandinavia, such as at St. Mary's, Helsingør, Denmark.\n\nA demonstration of just how far his ideas went can be found at Seville Cathedral, begun in 1402 and today still the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. The standard Gothic verticality of the central space is broken up by a balustrade at the boundary with the clerestory windows. More importantly, the balustrade's widely spaced vertical bars and its position flowing outside of the outermost ribs are exactly like Peter Parler's original design of the western bays at St. Vitus’ Cathedral. Construction at Seville Cathedral continued until 1506.\n\nDuring the Hussite wars (1419–1434) the lands of the Bohemian Crown were totally ravaged. Although his buildings still stand, much of Peter Parler's sculptural works were destroyed. A portrait of him, carved out of his hand, remains in the \"\" at St. Vitus Cathedral.\n\nAn Asteroid named in honor of Peter Parler, 6550 Parléř, was discovered by Antonín Mrkos at Kleť Observatory on 4 November 1988.\n\nThe \"Peter Parler Prize\" was established in 1994 by the German Foundation for Monument Protection () and the Federal Association of German Stonemasons (). It is awarded every two years at the International Exhibition of Natural Stone and Stone Processing in Nuremberg for outstanding service in the preservation of cultural heritage. The prize is accompanied by a commemorative bust of Peter Parler and EUR 15,000. It was most recently awarded in 2015 to August Weber and Helmut Schneider for restoration work at St. George's church in Ulm.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944405", "title": "Queensland Council of Unions", "text": "Queensland Council of Unions\n\nThe Queensland Council of Unions (QCU) is a representative, peak body of Queensland trade union organisations, also known as a labour council, in the Queensland, Australia. As of 2020, 26 unions and 13 regional branches were affiliated with the QCU. The QCU represents unions covering around 350,000 Queensland workers. It is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Its offices are located in the suburb of South Brisbane, Queensland. As a peak body for the Queensland trade unions, the objective of the QCU is to achieve industrial, social and political justice for Queensland workers. The management structure of the QCU is made up of a committee of management and an executive of representatives comprised from affiliated unions.\n\nThe history of the QCU is intertwined with the history of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Australian labour movement generally. The QCU was formed in 1885, but in 1889 it disbanded and all its roles and responsibilities were transferred to a newly formed peak body, the Australian Labor Federation (ALF) (which despite its name was restricted to Queensland). In 1902 the QCU reformed, but again, in 1911, all its delegates moved to the ALF. In 1914 the ALF itself dissolved, with its affiliates moving to the growing Australian Workers Union (AWU). At this time the roles of the QCU were shared by a number of labour organisations, including the Brisbane Industrial Council, the Eight Hour Union and the Brisbane Trades Hall Board. At the end of World War One in 1918 Queensland unions regrouped but it was another four years before 46 unions reformed the Queensland Trades and Labour Council, now known as the QCU.\n\nThe origins of the organisation lie in the rapid rise of the Australian labour movement in the 1880s. Due to a mining and pastoral boom in the regions outside South East Queensland there was an influx of large numbers of immigrant workers, while in Brisbane and South East Queensland a number of small craft unions were established. On 18 August 1885 a meeting of union secretaries decided to form the Trades and Labour Council, which came into being on 1 September 1885. The next year, 1886, the new labour organisation was sanctioned by the Liberal government of the day (led by the then moderate liberal Samuel Walker Griffith) which passed the Queensland Trade Union Act, legitimising trade unionism in the colony.\n\nIn the late 1880s, Queensland was a vast, decentralised colony where predominantly white, male workers were clustered in regional areas around the rural extractive industries – the mines and the great shearing sheds. Queensland had no industrial base to speak of, even in the south east corner. Workers had been lured to Queensland, mainly from Britain, with the promise of being self-made men. The percentage of successful immigrants to become wealthy pastoralists, mining magnates or industrialists was very small – by 1887 most immigrant workers in the mining industries were wage-labourers for a mere 30 mining companies. The wool industry was similarly consolidated. In New South Wales there were 3,000 shearing sheds. In the whole of Queensland there were only 150. The forcing together of large numbers of bitter, disillusioned men encouraged working-class mateship, heavy drinking and a spectacular growth of trade unionism in the colony. Class activism was further fuelled by several firebrand journalists of the day, notably William Lane who worked on the Brisbane Courier and the Brisbane Observer before starting the Boomerang in 1887. The racy, iconoclastic Boomerang took the colony by storm, propagating socialist and republican ideas. Henry Lawson wrote under the name Joe Swallow.\n\nThis was a period of rapid growth and saw the establishment of several major unions. The Queensland Shearers Union was formed in January 1887 to help combat pastoralists' attempts to reduce the shearing rate. By August 1889 it had close to three thousand members. The Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia was formed in 1887, mostly representing workers in southern states, eventually in 1894 merging with other rural-based unions to form the Australian Workers' Union. The Queensland Labourers' Union was established at Saltern Creek in 1888 as the Central Queensland Labourers' Union, then in 1892 amalgamated with the Queensland Shearers' Union to form the Amalgamated Workers Union of Queensland. The Queensland Teachers Union was established in 1889. The Amalgamated Workers Union merged with the Australian Workers Union in 1904.\n\nThe Fifth Intercolonial Trade Union Congress in Brisbane in 1889 accepted the proposal to form the Australian Labour Federation, with the inaugural meeting on 11 June 1889. The QCU disbanded, transferring its roles and responsibilities to the new peak body. For all intents and purposes, this was the QCU continuing under another name. The Australian Labour Federation was an attempt to create an Australia-wide peak body, but after failing to attract support outside Queensland it was dissolved in 1914 when its main supporter, the Amalgamated Workers Union merged with the Australian Workers' Union.\n\nIn 1887 William Shand, aide-de-camp to the Queensland Governor Anthony Musgrave, was sharply critical of the fanciful promises made to immigrant workers to make their fortune in a so-called workers paradise, when in fact poorer workers lived in wooden shanties cobbled together from old biscuit boxes and wine cases. Shand was even more alarmed at how the growing trade union movement was drafting new arrivals into unions, these labour organisations already having had some success in hiking up wages and blocking non-union (scab) labour. At this time, 1877, there were 2,500 union members registered under the Queensland Trade Union Act. By 1890 this number had ballooned more than eight-fold to 21,500. Even Liberals were caught up in the excitement. In 1889 Samuel Walter Griffith, barrister and 9th Premier of Queensland, after being defeated by the conservative Thomas McIlwraith in 1888, wrote radical articles advocating state intervention to curb capitalism, redistribute wealth, protect the weak and enforce the rule of freedom. Griffith's radical reformer phase was short lived however, as in 1890 he suddenly betrayed his radical friends and became Premier again at the head of an unlikely alliance with McIlwraith, forming the so-called \"Griffilwraith\" government. Also on the political front, Thomas Glassey became Australia's first Labour parliamentarian, representing Ipswich coalminers. He was joined in 1890 by John Plumper Hoolan. Early industrial action had international support, with the British Seamen's Union backing the Queensland Shearers Union to victory in the Jondaryan dispute, by blocking transport and handling of Jondaryan wool bales.\nThe Brisbane \"Worker\" newspaper was established in 1890 by the ALF under the editorship of William Lane, who remained in the post until 1892. This was a time of prolonged and bitter industrial disputes, with the first of the great Australian strikes in the 1890s: the 1890 Australian Maritime Dispute, followed by the 1891 Shearers' strike, and the 1894 Shearers strike.\n\nA Labour Council had formed again by 1903, but in 1911 all affiliates transferred to the ALF. In January 1914 the ALF itself effectively dissolved, as many of its affiliates had been swallowed by the Australian Workers' Union. A new organisation called the Brisbane Industrial Council was formed midyear. Other inter-union organisations included the Eight Hours Union and the Brisbane Trades Hall Board, responsible for managing Brisbane Trades Hall. During the First World War closer unity between labour movement organisations was explored culminating in a conference in September 1918 attended by 42 unions adopting an amalgamation scheme. After lengthy negotiations, on 12 April 1922 the \"Trades and Labour Council of Queensland\" was established by 46 unions.\n\nIn 1993 the organisation was renamed the \"Australian Council of Trade Unions Queensland Branch\" to reflect its primary function and role. The name again changed in 1999 to Queensland Council of Unions to rebuild its local identity as a peak organisation for Queensland trade unions.\n\nOther important industrial disputes in Queensland include the 1912 Brisbane General Strike, the 1948 Queensland Railway strike, the SEQEB dispute and the 1998 Australian waterfront dispute.\n\nIn 2012, Queensland Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the ALP and the QCU were providing seed funding for the TJ Ryan Foundation to provide a forum for debate on policies and policy development. On 27 February 2014 the TJ Ryan Foundation was launched, taking the form of an online platform for the publication of commentary and analysis by public policy academics and experts.\n\nAs a peak body for the Queensland trade unions the objective of the QCU is to achieve industrial, social and political justice for Queensland workers, by\n\n\nSome of the functions and services of the QCU include research, presentation of state general wage cases, presentation of test cases in the Industrial Relations Commission, co-ordination of multi-union negotiations, preparation of submissions for committees of inquiry and review and providing training opportunities for affiliated union delegates.\n\nManagement structure of the QCU is made up of a committee of management (acting as leadership and secretariat for an executive which is made up of 39 representatives, one from each of the affiliated unions). The 39-member Executive meets once a month.\n\nCurrent positions (as at 15 January 2020) on the committee of management include Honorary President (Kate Ruttiman), General Secretary Michael Clifford, and senior Vice-Presidents Beth Mohle (Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union) and Owen Doogan (Rail, Tram and Bus Union). The remaining management committee positions are seven Vice-Presidents and an Honorary Treasurer.\n\nThe QCU Management Committee and Executive are assisted by several staff. As well as the President and general secretary, staff positions include a Campaign Officer, Research and Policy Officer, and a Media and Communications Officer. A number of Project Officers, Information Officers and Organisers carry out roles to assist the management committee, the executive and members of affiliated unions in areas including industrial matters, workers compensation information and education. Administrative staff positions include Office Manager, Administrative Assistants and Finance Officers.\n\nThe QCU has a number of committees leading discussion about issues including:\n\n\nTwo major unions in Queensland affiliated to Labor Right are not members of the QCU. These are the Australian Workers' Union and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association. \n\nThe Affiliates of the QCU are the trade unions which choose to become part of the peak body and are represented on the executive. One representative, or delegate, from each union is chosen to be on the executive which makes all decisions about the policies and directions the QCU takes in carrying out the interests of its member unions. Sometimes federal unions or unions in other states and territories may not be affiliated with their own state or federal counterparts of the QCU, which nevertheless are affiliated in Queensland. For example, on 4 July 2011 the Independent Education Union of Australia disaffiliated from the ACTU (the federal peak body) due to concerns relating to education policy but is affiliated with the QCU in Queensland. The ACTU maintains a national directory of affiliated unions and union officials. Because of widespread amalgamations in the period 1983–1999 and still continuing, names of trade unions have changed, with some retaining parts of their former identities, often seen in historical banners on Labour Day.\n\n\nOn 1 March 1858, stonemasons working for John Petrie won the \"eight-hour day\", which was first commemorated on 1 March 1865. Initially only those workers who had achieved an eight-hour day were allowed to march in Eight Hour Day processions. By 1890, at least 11 unions had achieved significant reduction in hours and improvement of conditions and all workers were allowed to participate in the march from 1890.\n\nDuring the 1891 Shearers Strike in Barcaldine, striking shearers held a procession on May Day, 1 May 1890, with the first Brisbane May Day march in 1893. Eight Hour Day was formally changed to the first Monday in May in 1901, when it was gazetted as a public holiday by the Queensland government. In 1912 the day was renamed \"Labour Day\".\n\nThe Labour Day march in Brisbane is an organised procession of the Australian labour movement which parades through the streets of Brisbane ending at a park where a festival takes place to entertain participants and their families. \n"}

The airport is located approximately midway between the cities of Starkville, Columbus, and West Point, Mississippi, and serves the surrounding Golden Triangle region of Mississippi and parts of West Alabama. GTR is used for general and military aviation, charter aircraft, and by commercial airline ExpressJet, operating as Delta Connection.\n\nAs per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 35,669 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 36,275 enplanements in 2009, and 36,329 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). It is the third-busiest commercial airport in the state of Mississippi.\n\nGTR is the nucleus of a new industrial complex in northeast Mississippi. American Eurocopter, a subsidiary of EADS North America, moved into an helicopter production plant built by the airport and leased to the company on airport property in 2004. In 2007 American Eurocopter finished the second phase of the project, a facility built primarily to manufacture and assemble the new U.S. Army UH-72A Lakota Light Utility Helicopter. Severstal North America opened a steel mini-mill in an adjacent site in October 2007 and immediately began construction on phase II, bringing total investment in the plant to $1.8 billion. Paccar, parent company of Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF (Dutch) trucks has operated a truck engine manufacturing facility since late 2010 that is located to the north of the airport. Other industry, many with international roots, continues to locate at the industrial park adjacent to the airport. The area has two \"Megasites\" adjacent to the airport that were certified under the Tennessee Valley Authority's Certified Megasite program. In addition, two aerospace companies, Aurora Flight Sciences and Stark Aerospace, built facilities on airport property and primarily manufacture unmanned aerial vehicles. Stark Aerospace is the newly formed subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries.\n\nGolden Triangle Regional Airport covers an area of 1,000 acres (405 ha) at an elevation of 264 feet (80 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 18/36 with an asphalt surface measuring 8,002 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m). This runway is long enough to accommodate Boeing 757s and 767s flown by college football teams visiting Mississippi State University and the Bulldogs to their away games. \n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2011, the airport had 29,864 aircraft operations, an average of 81 per day: 50% general aviation, 41% military, and 9% air taxi. At that time there were 37 aircraft based at this airport: 68% single-engine, 16% multi-engine, 3% jet, and 14% helicopter.\n\nBecause of the projected growth, in the years since 2003 the airport has spent significant resources improving and upgrading the infrastructure. In 2003 a $1.6 million air traffic control tower was opened to maintain the safety of the flying operation and is manned under the FAA's Contract Tower Program. The runway was repaved and strengthened to take commercial aircraft up to a Boeing 757. Two additional parking ramps were constructed and the two existing ramps were rehabilitated. The terminal has had minor renovations but a major expansion was completed in 2010. A runway expansion from 6,497' to 8,000' was completed in June 2011.\n\nAirline offering scheduled passenger service to non-stop destination:\n\nChautauqua Airlines, a Republic Airways Holdings company, also operated flights under the Delta Connection banner early in 2006. Until Delta's withdrawing \"focus city\" operations from Dallas-Fort Worth in February 2005, GTR had one flight per day to DFW. Four ASA flights per day to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport remained until late 2005. In 2006, there were three flights per day to ATL.\n\nMesaba Aviation, d.b.a. Northwest Airlink, also operated flights to Memphis from GTR, but they ceased these operations in 2003 citing a desire to not compete with the new regional jet service being started by ASA as they replaced the Embraer fleet.\n\nWith the acquisition of Northwest Airlines by Delta Air Lines in 2008 Delta took over scheduling the Northwest flights in the Memphis hub. On January 27, 2009 Delta announced the resumption of service between GTR and Memphis on Mesaba Airlines, now operating as a Delta Connection carrier. The new service began on May 4, 2009 and supplements the Atlantic Southeast Airlines service to Atlanta. In 2010, Pinnacle Airlines started flying CRJ-200s as Delta started phasing the Saab-340 aircraft out of their Connection Carrier fleet.\n\nIn June 2019, Delta Connection added a fourth flight to Atlanta, adding an early afternoon flight.\n\n"}

Her parents divorced when she was only two years old. The reasons given for their divorce were that her father was unable to find his \"perfect wife\"; in addition, there was a 33-year age difference. Jennifer had a close relationship with her father for the rest of his life. Partly because her father did not want her to become an actress, she tried other things for several years. As a teenager during high school at Brentwood School in Los Angeles and on break from college, she worked as a babysitter, stock clerk at the Village store in Pacific Palisades, grocery store checkout cashier at the Rainbow Grocery in Malibu, and waitress at the Pioneer Boulangerie restaurant in Santa Monica. After graduating from Stanford University in 1987 with a degree in American Studies, she worked for a law firm, and followed that with a job as a chef at Wolfgang Puck's Spago restaurant in Beverly Hills.

The United Irishmen organisation in Carlow led by a young brogue-maker named Mick Heydon who had taken over the leadership following the arrest of the previous leader, Peter Ivers, who was arrested with several other leading United Irishmen at Oliver Bond's house in March of that year, had assembled on the night of the 24th and set off at dawn to attack the county town. Picking up more volunteers along the way, their numbers swelled to around 1,200 they marched completely unopposed.\n\nAn attack on the town would take place simultaneously from four different directions, through the four main streets.\n\n1. From Bennekerry and Tinryland, an assault would be made into Tullow Street.\n\n2. From Ballybar and Garryhundon, people would march in through Burrin Street.\n\n3. From Laois, the attack would be across Graigue bridge, over the Barrow and past the old Norman Castle crouching in the darkness.\n\n4. From Palatine and Maganey, Dublin Street would be infiltrated.\n\nAll would converge on Potato Market.\n\nAs the various contingents advanced, they did not know that Colonel Mahon of the Ninth Dragoons had the military in the barracks and the town on the highest alert. Their every move was known to him.\nA strong party of military was stationed in the court house which is now known as the Deighton Hall (this is situated immediately to the north of the bridge across the river Burrin).\nAnother party with two small cannon were stationed on the bridge. On Graigue bridge, there was an officer's guard of yeomen.\nIn Dublin Street and to the north, well-armed loyalists filled some large strong houses, but without military support, as the attack was known to be weak from that quarter.\nTullow Street was left open and to all appearances undefended against what was expected would be the strongest attack of all. The trap was laid.\n\nWhen the Rebels entered the town of Carlow they were joined not only by the Catholic inhabitants but also by people who had secretly arrived there during the previous day and night. A crowd of approximately two hundred people broke away and marched through Tullow Street but when they reached Potato Market their fortunes changed.\n\nHowever, the forewarned garrison had prepared a deadly ambush, posting men at every window and rooftop. As the rebels relaxed after their apparently easy victory, the concealed soldiers poured volley after volley of gunfire into the masses of exposed rebels. Taken completely by surprise, the shocked and poorly armed rebels broke and fled only to run into another army ambush. The survivors tried to escape by breaking through adjoining houses and cabins which were set alight by the pursuing soldiers causing the deaths of 200 of the inhabitants. One survivor William Farrell wrote of the carnage;\n\nI know a man as gentle as any who woke to realize his house was on fire [and] threw on some clothes and ran to the street carrying his young daughter. He was instantly shot dead and his child.\n\nWhen they came to Potato Market, the place appointed, they halted and commenced shouting as a signal for all their friends to come to their assistance, but they shouted in vain; the friends they expected were too much terrified with the preparations that were made to stir one inch. When they found this, that they were left alone, they were seized with a sudden panic, and some of them proposed to march forward to bring in the Queen's County men. But just as they made the movement to go on, there were two sentries at the Collector's house, a little below them in Tullow Street, and one of them presented his piece and fired, and killed one of the party, and this single shot stopped the whole body. \n\nIn the meantime the County Laois Rebels on their way to aid the Carlow rebels having heard mixed reports of the battle and hearing the fate of their comrades decided it was too late to help and changed their plans. They were led by men called Redmond and Brennan. They proceeded to Ballickmoyler instead, some miles outside Carlow but in the county Laois and there they set fire to many loyalist houses and attacked the home of John Whitty, a Protestant clergyman. Twenty-one of the Rebels were killed in the fray but despite this they eventually overcame the loyalists inhabitants.\n\nAn estimated 500 rebels and civilians were killed in the streets of the town with no reported losses to the military. Another 150 were executed in the repression over the following ten days. A local man who became known as \"Paddy the Pointer\" is reported to have helped to identify escaped rebels to the military by riding around the town and pointing them out. A memorial, where remains of many of those who perished that day were flung into a \"Croppy Hole\" (mass grave), is located at Carlow-Graigue, or Graigue-Cullen as it is now known.\n\n"}

{"id": "1944455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944455", "title": "Inlays and onlays", "text": "Inlays and onlays\n\nIn dentistry, inlays and onlays are a form of indirect restoration. This means they are made outside of the mouth as a single, solid piece, that fits the specific size and shape of the cavity. The restoration is then cemented in place in the mouth. This is an alternative to a direct restoration, made out of composite, amalgam or glass ionomer, that is built up within the mouth.Inlays and onlays are used in molars or premolars, when the tooth has experienced too much damage to support a basic filling, but not so much damage that a crown is necessary. The key comparison between them is the amount and part of the tooth that they cover. An inlay will incorporate the pits and fissures of a tooth, mainly encompassing the chewing surface between the cusps. An onlay will involve one or more cusps being covered. If all cusps and the entire surface of the tooth is covered this is then known as a crown.\n\nHistorically inlays and onlays will have been made from gold and this material is still commonly used today. Alternative materials such as porcelain were first described being used for inlays back in 1857. Due to its tooth like colour, porcelain provides better aesthetic value for the patient. In more recent years, inlays and onlays have increasingly been made out of ceramic materials. In 1985, the first ceramic inlay created by a chair-side CAD-CAM device was used for a patient. More recently, in 2000, the CEREC 3 was introduced. This allows for inlays and onlays to be created and fitted all within one appointment. Furthermore, no impression taking is needed due to the 3D scanning capabilities of the machine.\n\nSometimes, a tooth is planned to be restored with an intracoronal restoration, but the decay or fracture is so extensive that a direct restoration, such as amalgam or composite, would compromise the structural integrity of the restored tooth or provide substandard opposition to occlusal (i.e., biting) forces. In such situations, an indirect gold or porcelain inlay restoration may be indicated.\n\nWhen an inlay is used, the tooth-to-restoration margin may be finished and polished to a very fine line of contact to minimize recurrent decay. Opposed to this, direct composite filling pastes shrink a few percent in volume during hardening. This can lead to shrinkage stress and rarely to marginal gaps and failure. Although improvements of the composite resins could be achieved in the last years, solid inlays do exclude this problem. Another advantage of inlays over direct fillings is that there is almost no limitations in the choice of material.\nWhile inlays might be ten times the price of direct restorations, it is often expected that inlays are superior in terms of resistance to occlusal forces, protection against recurrent decay, precision of fabrication, marginal integrity, proper contouring for gingival (tissue) health, and ease of cleansing offers. However, this might be only the case for gold. While short term studies come to inconsistent conclusions, a respectable number of long-term studies detect no significantly lower failure rates of ceramic\n\nor composite\n\ninlays compared to composite direct fillings. Another study detected an increased survival time of composite resin inlays but it was rated to not necessarily justify their bigger effort and price.\nInlays and Onlays are similar as they are a type of indirect restoration. However, the difference is that Inlays are indirect restorations which do not have cuspal coverage and are within the body of the tooth.(1) Onlays are indirect restorations that cover both body and cusps of teeth.\n\nInlay Indications:\n\n\nInlays are a type of indirect restoration (filling) that is used to restore extensively damaged or decayed teeth. When compared to conventional (direct) fillings, inlays have several advantages:\n\n\nInlays are a hugely popular restorative technique, used in cases to preserve tooth substance and provide a greater strength than restorations. Inlays are most commonly constructed in composite resin and ceramic materials. Both types have varying properties, however the general downsides to inlays include:\n\n\nWhen decay or fracture incorporate areas of a tooth that make amalgam or composite restorations inadequate, such as cuspal fracture or remaining tooth structure that undermines perimeter walls of a tooth, an onlay might be indicated. Similar to an inlay, an onlay is an indirect restoration which incorporates a cusp or cusps by covering or \"onlaying\" the missing cusps. All of the benefits of an inlay are present in the onlay restoration. The onlay allows for conservation of tooth structure when the only alternative is to totally eliminate cusps and perimeter walls for restoration with a crown. Just as inlays, onlays are fabricated outside of the mouth and are typically made out of gold or porcelain. Gold restorations have been around for many years and have an excellent track record. In recent years, newer types of porcelains have been developed that seem to rival the longevity of gold. If the onlay or inlay is made in a dental laboratory, a temporary is fabricated while the restoration is custom-made for the patient. A return visit is then required to fit the final prosthesis. Inlays and onlays may also be fabricated out of porcelain and delivered the same day utilizing techniques and technologies relating to CAD/CAM dentistry.\n\nA systemic review found that the most common cause of onlay failure is ceramic fracture, followed by ceramic de-bonding from the tooth structure, and the occurrence of secondary caries which is seen as a discolouration at the margins of the restoration. High failure rates were associated with teeth that had previous root canal treatment, and with patients who exhibit para-functional habits such as bruxism , or teeth clenching.\n\nInlays/onlays are indicated when teeth are weakened and extensively restored. There are no obvious contrast between the two.\n\nInlays are usually indicated when there has been repeated breach in the integrity of a direct filling as metal inlays are more superior in strength. It is also indicated when placement of direct restoration may be challenging to achieve satisfactory parameters (shape, margin, occlusion). They are usually reserved for larger cavities as tooth conservation is paramount in current practice and small cavities can be restored with direct composites instead.\n\nOnlays are indicated when there is a need to protect weakened tooth structure without additional removal of tooth tissue unlike a crown, e.g. restoring teeth after root canal treatment to give cuspal coverage. It can also be used if there is minimal contour of remaining coronal tooth tissue with little retention.\n\nContraindications to providing Onlays and Inlays include plaque and active caries. It is important to ensure adequate oral hygiene before providing any indirect restoration as failure to manage the caries risk of an individual may result in recurrent caries. Caries risk is defined as “a prediction as to whether a patient is likely to develop new caries in the future”. The restoration itself does not alter the risk, which allows subsequent caries to develop around the indirect restoration placed. This may be caused by plaque retentive features of the restoration, or if the restoration is poorly bonded to the tooth. However, in the main the subsequent caries around a restoration is because the caries risk has not been reduced. Reducing the patients risk of further disease prior to treatment provides predictable results and helps prevent further restorative procedures.\n\nInlays and Onlays are contraindicated in patients with parafunctional habits and heavy occlusal forces. A Parafunctional habit refers to abnormal functioning of oral structures and associated muscles, for example patients who clench or grind their teeth. Occlusal forces are greater on molars when compared to premolars. Evidence (Fuzzi and Rapelli) has shown greater failure of Onlays and Inlays in molars than premolars over an 11.5 year period. The most common cause for failure was porcelain fracture. To ensure longevity it is beneficial to avoid heavy occlusal forces. If a cuspal coverage onlay is required porcelain should be used as cuspal coverage with composite is contraindicated.\n\nIndirect restorations are contraindicated in patients under 16 as the pulp chamber is still large and wide dentinal tubules increase the stress on the pulp. When preparing a cavity to retain an indirect restoration there is a risk of damage to the nerve supply of a vital tooth. The tooth has not fully erupted and continued active and passive eruption can cause unfavourable margins when the tooth is fully through as the patient is still undergoing skeletal development. Young children may be unable to cope with invasive dental treatment and long procedures, therefore it is advantageous to wait until they are fully cooperative.\n\nPatients need to be able to cope with dental impressions as these are required for the fabrication of the indirect restoration. Development of digital impression systems including Lava Chairside oral scanner by 3M, Sirona's CEREC and Cadent iTero System could help patients receive treatment if the contraindication is being unable to withstand conventional impressions. Digital impressions enable production of highly accurate models whilst eliminating patient discomfort. However, these systems are not widely available in dental practices, as of 2018.\n\nIf a tooth has extensive caries or tooth surface loss which would provide difficulty bonding an inlay or onlay then it might be more appropriate to consider a full coverage extra coronal restoration. This can protect remaining tooth structure. Direct restorations, for example composite may be beneficial when restorations are small. Inlays require elimination of undercuts, therefore direct restorations may preserve tooth structure whilst also avoiding unwanted laboratory costs.\n\n           The preparation of inlays and onlays mainly follows the same basic concepts of indirect restorations. The aim of tooth preparation is to preserve more tooth tissue compared to a crown preparation, while giving an adequate amount of protection to the tooth. The preparation of opposing cavity walls should be cut in a way to avoid undercuts in order to gain optimum retention from the cavity shape for the indirect restoration. For inlay and onlay preparations that are going to be completed with all-ceramic then these cavity shapes can be slightly over-tapered as most of the retention is gained from the cement lute. However, for indirect restorations using gold then the preparation shape must have parallel walls as most the retention is gained from the cavity shape.\n\n           The process of preparation and cementation of an inlay or onlay is usually carried out over two appointments, with the preparation being carried out during the first appointment and cementation at the second. After the tooth has been prepared at the first visit a putty and wash impression should be taken of the prepared tooth to be sent to the laboratory for fabrication of the indirect restoration. Also, a provisional restoration is made using material such as ProTemp, to protect the tooth from sensitivity, loss of vitality, bacterial contamination, to prevent over-eruption of the prepared tooth and also maintains dental aesthetics for the time being.\n\nFor tooth preparation, firstly start with occlusal reduction which depending on the restorative material being used can range from 0.5mm-2mm. The best instrument to use for this is a high-speed diamond fissure bur and the reduction should follow the inclination of the cusps and grooves as this will allow the preservation of more tooth tissue. A functional occlusal bevel should be created on the occlusal loading cusp of molar teeth by holding the bur at a 45 angle to the occlusal surface. This is the buccal cusp for mandibular teeth and the palatal cusp for maxillary teeth. A high-speed tapered diamond bur has the most convenient shape to prepare the buccal, lingual and proximal reduction of the tooth.\n\nIn the majority of clinical situations an inlay preparation is being made from a tooth that already has a Class II restoration and is being prepared to protect the tooth. The restoration is firstly removed and then the cavity can be converted by ensuring any undercuts are eliminated from the preparation. There are two ways this can be done, either by blocking the undercuts out with an adhesive restorative material or by removing tooth tissue to create the divergent cavity needed.\n\nThere are a few methods of fabricating inlays and onlays, depending on the restorative material used.\n\nThe first common step is always to take an impression of the tooth preparation – either by scanning it using an intraoral scanner or by taking a conventional impression using polyvinyl siloxane.\nThe details of the fabrication methods are as follows:\n\nCAD-CAM (aka Computer Aided Design-Computer Aided Manufacture) is a fabrication method which aids the production of dental restorations e.g. crowns, bridges, inlays and onlays. It is possible for these indirect restorations to be provided in one visit. This works by first taking an intra-oral scan to produce a 3D virtual impression. The 3D image is then sent to the chosen software programme, available software programmes include CEREC Acquisition Center system (Sirona Dental Systems, Charlotte, N.C.) or the E4D Dentist system (D4D Technologies, Richard - son, Texas). It is possible for the 3D image to originate from conventional casts which have been poured up in stone/plaster. The model is scanned and the 3D image is uploaded onto the software. Next, the restoration can be designed, by the software programme, on the virtual casts. Once confirmed, the milling process can begin. The milling process uses pre-fabricated blocks of restorative material, e.g. lithium disilicate or composite reinforced ceramic, to produce the end product. Finally, the restoration is sintered/glazed chair side.\n\nThere are two ways in which wax can be used to produce cast metal/ceramic indirect restorations, these are known, firstly, as the indirect wax technique using Type 1 inlay wax and, secondly, the direct wax technique using Type 2 inlay wax. For technique 1, a wax pattern is designed on the die from the cast impressions and for technique 2 the wax is packed into the tooth preparation in the mouth and adapted the shape of the cavity.\n\nInlay wax is chosen due to its brittleness – it breaks upon removal from undercut of a cavity, either on the die or in the mouth. In this case, this is a beneficial character as it helps us to identify the presence of an undercut which then can be removed.\n\nOnce the wax pattern is constructed the fabrication of this into the final restoration can begin, a method known as the Lost Wax Technique is used. The wax is embedded into an investment material with a sprue former – this forms a passage for molten metal to be poured through into the cylinder. The investment material must produce enough expansion to compensate for shrinkage of the metal on solidification and should be slightly porous to allow for dissipation of released gases. The container, or casting cylinder, is then placed in a furnace to burn out the wax and what is left is a hollow shape ready for molten metal to be poured into. The metal can be melted using either gas and compressed air, gas and oxygen or electric arc. Casting methods include the use of steam pressure or a centrifugal system.\n\nGold is an example of a material that can be used to produce inlays/onlays. Once cast a layer of oxides are present on the surface, these can be removed by placing the restoration in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes. This removes the oxides along with any remnants of investment material.\n\nPossible faults at casting:\n\n\nThis method is only applicable to sintered alumina core porcelain. Firstly, a sub-structure made of alumina powder and modelling fluid is built on the special die. w The die is then sintered by firing with the sub-structure, causing the fluid to be absorbed by the die and the alumina powder become more tightly packed.\n\nFollowing sintering, the outer surface of the sub-structure is painted with lanthanum aluminosilicate glass powder. The sub-structure is porous and therefore allows infiltration of the glass powder when fired again.\n\nFurther strengthening of the material can be done by applying zirconium oxide.\n\nBy using this technique, an impression of the tooth preparation is not required. Instead, the tooth preparation is coated with a layer of separating material such as glycerin first. Then, a composite restoration is built up directly on the preparation, allowing it to take the shape of the cavity. The restoration is then light-cured in the tooth before being removed from the tooth to be further light-cured.\n\nPrior to cementation of the restoration onto the prepared the tooth, the layer of separating materials needs to be removed to ensure effective bonding between the tooth and the restoration.\n\nThis technique is only applicable when composite is used as the restorative material. Inlays and onlays made from ceramic or metal alloy require laboratory work and therefore can only be fabricated using indirect restorative techniques as mentioned in the previous section.\n\nA study done by Rippe \"et al.\" has shown that ceramic inlays produced by the different methods, via indirect restorative techniques aforementioned, have similar longevity.\n\nThe use of gold as a restorative material for the production of inlays and onlays is fading due to the increase in usage of more aesthetically pleasing tooth coloured materials. Gold has many advantages as a restorative material, including high strength and ductility, making it ideal to withstand the masticatory forces put upon the teeth. It is strong, ductile, can be cast accurately and not abrasive to opposing dentition. This property allows gold to be used in thinner cross sections, meaning less tooth tissue needs to be removed during tooth preparation compared to other restorative materials, to achieve the same strength. The tooth preparation needs near parallel wall and an absence of undercut, hence less occlusal and axial reduction. When the patient is not concerned with aesthetics, such as in posterior teeth, gold can provide the properties needed.\n\nCeramic materials began being used in restorative dentistry in the 1900s. Ceramic offers a more aesthetically pleasing restoration colour than previous gold and amalgam restorations. It is aesthetic and has high wear resistance. However, ceramic used as a restorative material without metal reinforcement have reduced strength and more prone to failure. This is because conventional ceramics have a higher fracture risk and fractures can propagate easily under cyclical loading causing marginal ridge or bulk fracture. To compensate for this, ceramic is placed in a thicker cross-section of at least 2mm for stress bearing areas. This reduces flexure under loading and prevents crack formation. Ceramic can also be abrasive to opposing tooth surfaces upon mastication. More tapered walls are needed in tooth preparation. Undercuts can be eliminated by further tooth preparation or be blocked out with an adhesive tooth - coloured material.\n\nResin composite is widely used in dentistry as a direct and indirect restorative material. It comes in different compositions, variable in content and size of filler particles. Composite inlays and onlays offer great aesthetics, as a combination of different shades and opacities can be used in a layering technique, equalling or surpassing the aesthetically pleasing all-ceramic restoration. It can be easily repaired or modified as composite can bond to existing material. Using composite as a direct restoration can have a relatively high polymerisation shrinkage, but this can be avoided by using a laboratory indirect composite restoration. Due to the more in-depth curing method, using heat, pressure or strong light, this can have a lower polymerisation shrinkage. Lab made composite has reduction in polymerisation shrinkage as there is higher degree of curing in lab as compared to chair-side curing. However, fewer reactive resin groups are available to bong to the resin luting cement indicating lower accuracy in fitting compared to the other materials. However, using this indirect laboratory method demands more skill and time, and is more destructive as tooth preparation is needed prior to taking an impression. Compared to ceramic and gold inlays and onlays, composite can provide similar advantages, but a comparison of the longevity of composite is unknown.\n\nMetal-ceramic inlays were developed to see if the aesthetic advantages of an all-ceramic inlay restoration could be replicated, whilst improving the strength and stability of the restoration. A study showed that the fracture resistance of all-ceramic inlays was greater than that of these metal-ceramic inlays. It went on further to find that it was the taper of the inlay preparation that affected the fracture resistance more so than the choice of restoration material.\n\nInlays and onlays are cemented in the mouth using adhesive resin luting cements. These materials are placed in the inlay/ onlay and placed onto the prepared tooth. Once the onlay/ inlay is seated, the viscosity of the adhesive resin luting cement decreases. This makes placing the inlay/onlay easier and reduces the chances of breakage.\n\nLuting cements can have a low modulus or a high modulus. Low modulus luting cements are more flexible and withstand more force without failing. If a high modulus cement is used to cement an inlay or onlay, the restoration will not be able to transfer stresses properly into the cavity walls. With a low modulus; the cement will absorb deformations under loading and limit the pressure transmitted to surrounding tooth structures.\n\nComposite inlays are cured by polymerisation shrinkage.  Usually the composite will have been ‘super cured’, which means cured using temperature, pressure or light. This makes the inlay sturdier and improves wear. However, the disadvantage of super curing is that it leaves less reactive resin groups to bond to the cement and therefore the strength of bond will be less.\n\nPreparation of inlays are with close to parallel walls and a key on the occlusal surface- this is sometimes sufficient for retention purposes so adhesive resin luting cements may not be needed.\n\nCeramic inlays can also be cured with chemically cured resin composite or dual cured resin composite. According to a 10-year evaluation of ceramic inlays cemented with both chemically cured resin composite and dual cured resin composite; the inlays cemented with chemically cured survived longer after cementation. After 10 years the survival of the chemically cured inlays were 100% and of the dual cured were 77%.\n\nBonding agents can be applied to dentine before cementation of inlays and onlays. This is something that is very useful as dentine contains a lot of mineral, which makes binding more problematic. A bonding agent that is applied straight after the preparation has been finished will give rise to greater dentine bond strengths. If the bonding agent is applied just before cementing the inlay/onlay or if no bonding agents are applied; the dentine bond strengths will be noticeably lower.\n\nIn conclusion; the type of luting agent and properties have an impact on how long ceramic/inlays will stay cemented in the mouth.\n"}

{"id": "1944460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944460", "title": "Kawasaki OH-1", "text": "Kawasaki OH-1\n\nThe Kawasaki OH-1 (nickname: \"Ninja\") is a military scout/observation helicopter developed and manufactured by the Kawasaki Aerospace Company. The primary operator is the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), who originally procured the OH-1 as a domestically-produced successor to their existing OH-6D \"Loach\" fleet. The OH-1 has the distinction of being the first helicopter to be entirely produced in Japan.\n\nIn addition to its use an observation helicopter, it can also be armed with various munitions to directly participate in combat; such weapons include a limited quantity of anti-tank missiles or air-to-air missiles for self-defense purposes. Several variants of the OH-1 have been proposed, these have included derivatives of the type to serve as an attack helicopter as well as an aborted project to develop utility helicopter based on OH-1. As of March 2014, a total of 38 OH-1s have entered service with the JGSDF, so far these have complemented the existing OH-6Ds rather than replace them.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the JGSDF developed a requirement for a new scout/observation helicopter to replace its Kawasaki license-built OH-6Ds, which became the OH-X programme. In June 1989, the JGSDF announced their intention to pursue the development of the OH-X. Several proposals to meet the OH-X requirement were submitted by Kawasaki, Fuji and Mitsubishi. In 1991, Kawasaki's proposal was selected by the JGSDF's Technical Research and Development Institute as the prime contractor for the OH-X programme. On 18 September 1992, the Kawasaki design formally appointed by the Ministry of Defense as the winner. Kawasaki was made responsible for producing 50 per cent of the airframe, as well as coordinating development of the rotor system; the remaining airframe elements were manufactured by Mitsubishi and Fuji. Development was formally launched in October 1992.\n\nIn early 1996, the first OH-1 prototype was rolled out. On 6 August 1996, the first of four OH-1 prototypes (designated XOH-1) performed the type's maiden flight. All four prototypes were flying by March 1997. The four prototypes were delivered to the Japanese Defence Agency for service testing from June to August 1997. By April 1998, flight testing of the prototypes was reportedly around half way complete, having accumulated a combined 400 flight hours during testing, further tests focused on flight validation, operational evaluation, and mission equipment functionality. These four prototype aircraft were all later remanufactured to conform to production standards and redelivered under new serial numbers to the JGSDF.\n\nIn June 1998, in response to the finalising of a production contract and an initial order for two OH-1s having been placed earlier that year, the manufacture of production OH-1s formally commenced; By the late 1990s, the JGSDF had announced that it had planned to procure between 150 and 250 OH-Xs to meet its requirements. This figure was significantly fewer than the 297 OH-6Ds that were in active service by March 1995, and there were repeated concerns that numbers could be further curtailed as a result of the impact of defense budget cuts. Procurement, and thus production, of the OH-1 was of a slow pace; each year, only a handful of rotorcraft would normally be purchased, such as a pair of OH-1s being the only units procured in 2004. By 2013, production of the OH-1 was reportedly as presumed to have been terminated.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the JGSDF was interested in procuring a new attack helicopter during the following decade, seeking to replace the Fuji-built Bell AH-1 Cobra fleet. Amongst the proposals produced by Japanese industries was a derivative of the OH-1, tentatively designated as the \"AH-2\". In 1999, it was revealed that the JGSDF was actively studying the modification of the OH-1 into an attack helicopter suitable to their requirements. The OH-1 had been intentionally designed with addition margin to accommodate such growth of scope, the main limiting facts being its transmission and engines. The AH-2 proposal would have involved installing uprated engines and the addition of new unspecified armaments for anti-tank combat missions; Boeing in particular was dismissive of the value of the proposed rotorcraft, claiming that it \"cannot fulfill the attack requirement\". Kawasaki's proposal was ultimately rejected in favour of a locally-built variant of the Boeing AH-64 Apache.\n\nIn 2005, Kawasaki proposed the development of a utility-orientated derivative of the OH-1 in response to the fledgling UH-X programme, which intended to replace the JGSDF's outdated fleet of Fuji-built Bell UH-1J Iroquois helicopters. This variant, which would have used the OH-1 as a base, would have featured a new cabin, avionics, transmission and engines, but would have also retained a high level of commonality between the observation and utility models. In 2006, the Japanese government approved a request to fund development of a more powerful variant of the OH-1's Mitsubishi TS1-10 engine. In March 2007, Kawasaki was reportedly close to finalizing its plans for the utility-orientated OH-1 derivative of the OH-1. In 2012, a refreshed proposal for the UH-X requirement was made by Kawasaki, emphasizing its use of OH-1 technology. In July 2015, the Japanese Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced its decision to accept a rival bid made by Fuji/Bell to domestically produce a modified version of the Bell 412 to meet the UH-X requirement instead.\n\nIn early 2007, Kawasaki confirmed that it was studying several capability improvements for the OH-1 in terms of adaptability, maneuverability and stability; industry sources also claimed that improvements to the range of the OH-1 along with significant power output increases from the type's TS-1-10 engines. Alternative powerplants for the OH-1 have also been suggested, such as the LHTEC T800 and the MTR MTR390. In late 2008, Kawasaki was considered implementing a series of improvements aimed at increasing the payload of OH-1; this proposed modification was dependent upon demand from the Japanese defense ministry.\n\nThe OH-1 Light Observation Helicopter is a tandem-seat, twin-engine scout helicopter. It has a narrow fuselage fitted with small stub wings and a non-retractable tail wheel undercarriage. The OH-1 is suited to armed scout, light escort, and observation duties. It is equipped with an automatic pilot system with flight holding functionality, while the cockpit features a multi-display system to lower workloads on its two-man crew.\n\nThe OH-1 is powered by a pair of Mitsubishi TS1 turboshaft engines, equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC), which drives a four-blade composite main rotor with a bearingless rotor hub along with a Fenestron-type anti-torque tail rotor (an enclosed tail-fan unit). The Fenestron uses eight asymmetrically-spaced blades to reduce both noise and vibration.\n\nA roof-mounted electro-optical sensor turret is located forward of the rotor head, containing a forward looking infrared sensor, a laser rangefinder and a colour TV camera. A total of four hardpoints are fitted under the rotorcraft's stub wings to allow the carriage of external stores, these have a total capacity of 132 kg (291 lb). The outer pylons can carry four Type 91 guided surface-to-air missiles, while the inner pylons are capable of carrying external fuel tanks for additional range or endurance. No additional armament is typically fitted.\n\nIn January 2000, the first production standard OH-1 was delivered to the JGSDF. The OH-1 is slated to replace the Hughes OH-6D, which remains in service as the primary aircraft in this role.\n\n\n\n"}

He has become just as popular as some of the franchise's most notable figures, such as players Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, and head coach Phil Jackson. Benny is one of the longest-tenured mascots in the NBA and in all of professional sports.\nBenny was named after Ben Bentley, the Bull's first Public Relations Manager and Stadium Announcer. Benny was one of the promotional tools general manager Pat Williams employed to boost the Bulls' arena entertainment and attendance.\n\nThe current and most popular Benny has had many \"relatives\" or family members over the years. His great-grandfather, in the late 1960s, was the first NBA mascot. Many other variations/family members of the bull where passed on to different ones, including Benny's chubby predecessor (or father) in the 1990s. A slim, dunking bull mascot named \"Da Bull\" was added at the time. According to an article on the Bulls' website: \"Da Bull is Benny the Bull's cousin, and he made his first appearance at a Bulls game during the 1995–96 season. That is why his uniform number is 95.\nAmong Da Bull's many talents are tumbling, gymnastics, playing basketball, break dancing, reading, officiating basketball games, and most importantly, performing his signature slam dunks.\n\nDa Bull does not have a tail like other Bulls. He lost his tail while practicing his amazing dunks at the United Center. By not having a tail, Da Bull has been able to perform even more slam dunks and tumbling because his long, skinny tail no longer gets in the way.\nAn injury to his hoof during the 1999–2000 Bulls season sidelined Da Bull briefly, but he returned to the trampoline after a short recovery period.\" His performer, Chester Brewer, was arrested in 2004 for illegally selling marijuana from his car, therefore retiring the mascot.\n\nIn 2004, the current version of Benny The Bull was introduced. He has been acclaimed as one of the most popular mascots of all time, including being named the most popular mascot in sports by \"Forbes\" in 2013.\n\nThe modern version of Benny is famous for his impressive dancing, aerobic flips and jumps, multiple dunking tricks, giant popcorn spilling, rappelling from the United Center rafters, shooting backwards halfcourt shots, banging on his drum, using multiple cans of silly string, interacting with crowds, instances of taunting opposing players (most notably his act of tearing off the pants of others' pre-game warm up outfits), driving his bike down stairs, throwing cakes, shooting T-shirts out of his \"Bullzooka\", and more. He usually performs trampoline dunks alongside his team \"Benny and the Elevators\" \nHis current \"family\" consists of two inflatable mascots named \"Big Ben\" and \"Benji\".\n(Benji has a similar appearance to \"Lil' Benny\", who used to appear alongside Benny on the court and in videos. Lil' Benny's overall design was based on the 1990s Benny).\n\nBenny's antics have gotten him worldwide attention and recognition. He's also been seen alongside multiple celebrities, from messing with Justin Bieber or performing the \"Single Ladies\" dance in front of Jay-Z \nIn addition to performing stunts and entertaining the crowd at Bulls games, Benny also makes public appearances around the Chicago area on behalf of the team. Benny made approximately 250 appearances per year. As a member of the Bulls' All-Star Reading Team, he appeared at schools to promote literacy and the importance of a good education. He could also be booked for private events. Benny had also worked as a mascot on individual dates for other professional sports franchises, such as the Billings Outlaws. He usually travels around in his van, 'Benny's Bull Ride™' and is almost always with his assistant, Todd Abbott.\n\nBarry Anderson, after 12 years of taking on the role of Benny, announced that he will be retiring on June 30, 2016, to take on other interests, although Benny won't disappear entirely.\n\nThe Bulls redesigned the Benny character in 2004 just for him after his impressive talents were awarded twice in the Capital One Mascot Challenge for his previous role, Monte from the University of Montana.\n\nBenny has bright red fur with large eyes, a tan snout, horns with red tips, orange and pink hair, a long red tail and black gloves with red fur on the back. Benny wears an authentic uniform (road red/black and home whites) and team-appointed athletic shoes. His jersey bears the name \"Benny\" above the number \"1\" on the back. From 2004 to modern times, the pupils of his eyes have gotten larger. Benny sports several different costumes based on the theme of the game as well as his overall \"mood\".

Late in high school, Gohlke's interest in photography waned; he sold his enlarger and, save for family snapshots, stopped taking pictures altogether.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Gohlke first attended Davidson College in North Carolina before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin, where he received a B.A. in English Literature in 1964. He went on to complete an M.A. in English Literature at Yale University in 1966. During a period of writer's block while at Yale, Gohlke returned to photography. He began making near-still films with a Super 8 movie camera before transitioning to 35-mm still photography. He eventually showed his work to documentary photographer and then-Yale professor Walker Evans, whose mode of seeing the American vernacular landscape would exert an enduring influence on Gohlke's work. From 1967-68, after leaving Yale, Gohlke studied with the landscape photographer Paul Caponigro, making weekly visits to Caponigro's Connecticut home.\n\nIn 1971, Gohlke relocated to Minneapolis, and a year later, in 1972, he began his first major body of work, documenting the grain elevators of America's central plains. Over the next five years, from 1972–77, the project took Gohlke from Minnesota to Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. From his early aesthetic interest in grain elevators, Gohlke became fascinated by their design, their connection to the surrounding landscape, and their function within the cities and towns they occupied. His photographic practice grew to include a research component whose relationship to the pictures themselves was one of reciprocal influence. A selection of the photographs was eventually published as \"Measure of Emptiness: Grain Elevators in the American Landscape\" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), Gohlke's first monograph.\n\nGohlke was one of ten photographers to be included in the 1975 exhibition “New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape,” organized by William Jenkins, then the assistant curator at the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House (now the George Eastman Museum). “New Topographics,” which represented a burgeoning movement within landscape photography toward unvarnished consideration of the vernacular landscape, has come to be regarded as a watershed moment in the history of the medium.\n\nOn April 10, 1979, an F4 tornado struck Gohlke's hometown of Wichita Falls, Texas, killing 42 people, injuring 1,700 more, and significantly damaging an 8 mile-square swath of the city. Shortly thereafter, Gohlke returned home to photograph the wreckage left in the tornado's wake. He returned to rephotograph the same sites a year later, crafting precise reconstructions of his previous views in order to document the city's recovery. .\n\nIn 1981, several months after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Skamania County, Washington, Gohlke made his first trip there to photograph the volcano and its environs. In order to convey the enormity of the event, which devastated approximately 250 square miles, Gohlke employed a variety of approaches, including aerial and panoramic views and sequential photography (rephotography) over various periods of time. From 1981 to 1990, Gohlke made five visits to the region, in many cases returning several times to the same location to record its transformation. He authored short didactic texts to accompany the images. In 2004, the Museum of Modern Art in New York mounted “Mt. St. Helens: Photographs by Frank Gohlke,” a solo exhibition (with accompanying catalog), co-organized by Peter Galassi, Chief Curator, Department of Photography, and John Szarkowski, Director Emeritus, Department of Photography.\n\nFrank Gohlke has, in his work, dealt consistently with questions of human usage and perception of land. He has photographed farmland in central France (on a commission from la mission photographique de la DATAR); conducted a personal survey of a portion of the line of latitude 42˚30’ N, which bisects Massachusetts; made two series of photographs tracing the courses of the Red River in North Texas and the Sudbury River in Massachusetts; and documented the urban landscape and residential architecture of Queens, NY (conjointly with photographer Joel Sternfeld, on a commission from Queens College). A selection of Gohlke's and Sternfeld's pictures were published as \"Landscape as Longing\" (Steidl, 2015). In 2013, Gohlke received a Fulbright travel grant to travel to Kazakhstan in order to document the disappearing wild apple forests surrounding the Kazakh city of Almaty.\n\nA mid-career retrospective of Gohlke's work was organized by the Amon Carter Museum (September 22, 2007 – January 6, 2008). The accompanying catalog, entitled \"Accommodating Nature: The Photographs of Frank Gohlke\" (Center for American Places and Amon Carter Museum, 2007), includes essays by Gohlke, Rebecca Solnit and John Rohrbach, Senior Curator of Photographs, Amon Carter Museum.\n\nGohlke has taught photography at Middlebury College; Colorado College; the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Massachusetts College of Art; and at Harvard, Princeton, and Yale Universities. In 2007, Gohlke accepted a teaching position at the University of Arizona College of Fine Arts in Tucson, Arizona, where he now lives and works.\n\nGohlke's work is held in the following public collections:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Large volumes of cheap alcohol such as beer, spirits, Bundaberg Rum and Jim Beam can be consumed. The activities usually start at night and run until morning, but from mid-afternoon people will start to arrive and the partying/drinking will begin. Country music is often featured at these events.\n\nHistorically the event was centered on country people trying to find a partner, but in modern times the focus has shifted to having a good time and meeting up with new and old friends, some of whom can live many hours away. This has changed the atmosphere of the events to such a degree that the dress code is relaxed and many do not wear formal gear, preferring to dress in clothes from opportunity shops. Even when they are wearing formal attire, today most of the men (and some of the women) sport Akubras, boots and R. M. Williams gear. Some people go in fancy dress, for example, school girls, nurses, clowns or lawn bowlers.\n\nIt is not unusual for the modern B&S's to be run by ute enthusiasts following minor Ute Musters. Ute drivers at the B&S Balls sometimes perform stunts, such as driving their utes at dusk and throw flames from the exhausts and do circle work. Circle work, usually banned, is where the utes are driven in tighter and tighter circles. Food dye is a regular sight at a B&S and is normally thrown on people (even when it is banned). A B&S Virgin (a person who is attending for the first time) is often marked with the word \"Virgin\".\n\nAfter the event people usually sleep in their swag on the back of their ute. Usually the committee supplies something for dinner and breakfast the next day. Some committees run a 'recovery' where the ball goers move to a different location to continue drinking, having fun and sometimes participating in competitions.\n\nTickets can cost anything from AU$80 to AU$110 and usually include all you can drink, dinner and sometimes breakfast as well as little gifts such as ear tags, hats, stickers and sometimes condoms and lubricant. People will travel many kilometres to attend the balls, and the profits made from them go to charities and organizations such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, Red Cross and the Australian Cancer Council, as well as local charities of the specific area.\n\nToday the future of B&S balls are in jeopardy as rising insurance costs take their toll and more young people from country areas move to cities. However thousands of people make the effort to drive for many hours to support something that they love and wish to continue for future generations. There are many websites dedicated to the future of balls.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Bachelor and Spinster Balls were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an \"event and festival\".\n"}

Designed by Cheryl Henson, daughter of Jim Henson, Hugo the Hornet was created in 1988, one year before Hurricane Hugo hit the Carolinas. Hugo was the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets from 1988-Now and the New Orleans Hornets from 2002–2013, before taking over as the mascot of the second Hornets franchise in the 2014–15 season.\n\nThe Hugo moniker was selected from a pool of more than 6,000 fan suggestions, and was inaugurated as part of the Charlotte Hornets' first season. In the aftermath of the damage resulting from Hurricane Hugo in September 1989, the Hornets announced that the Hugo moniker would remain, and the mascot's name would not be changed to Hoser or Hank.\n\nDuring the break between the first and second quarters in a game between the New Orleans Hornets and the San Antonio Spurs, Hugo jumped off of a trampoline, through a ring of fire, and dunked a basketball. Afterwards, the New Orleans Arena crew responsible for cleaning up after the stunt used the wrong fire extinguisher and could not put out the fire. Eventually the arena filled with smoke, and the floor became covered with slippery chemicals which proved difficult to remove from the playing surface. It took a 19-minute delay to finally make the arena floor suitable for play again; NBA Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Stu Jackson canceled the halftime show in response. Later, Jackson would fine the Hornets organization for the mishap. During the halftime show, Charles Barkley dared Hugo to do the act after the 3rd quarter, calling him gutless if he did not do it. Barkley continued calling out Hugo throughout the night and in the next game.\n\nAfter the first Hornets franchise became the Pelicans in 2013, Hugo was retired in favor of Pierre the Pelican. Not long after, the Bobcats announced on December 21 that Hugo would be the mascot for the renamed Hornets in the 2014–15 season, replacing Rufus D. Lynx. Hugo officially returned to Charlotte on June 5, 2014.\n\nHugo is a 4-time winner of the NBA Mascot Slam Dunk Championship. Hugo is also a 2-time winner of the NBA Best Mascot Award by \"NBA Inside Stuff\", a magazine that he has been featured in on numerous occasions. In addition, Hugo has also been featured in such foreign magazines as \"New Sports\" and \"5 Majeur\".\n\nHugo, as well as three other NBA mascots (Benny the Bull, Crunch the Wolf and The Suns Gorilla), appears as a hidden player in the video game \"NBA Jam Tournament Edition\".\n\n"}

It is cooked in a variety of ways, including baking it on a hot griddle or pan, or in an oven. It may be leavened or unleavened, and may have a variety of other ingredients baked into it. The ratio of potato to wheat flour varies significantly from recipe to recipe, with some recipes having a majority of potato, and others having a majority of wheat flour. Some recipes call for mashed potatoes, with others calling for dehydrated potato flakes. It is available as a commercial product in many countries, with similar variations in ingredients, cooking method, and other variables.\n\nPotato bread goes by many regional names, including slims, fadge, potato cake, potato farls, and tatie bread in Ireland.\n\nPotato bread, in different forms, is a common element of the cuisine of Chiloé in Southern Chile. The most popular breads are milcao and chapalele, which are part of the traditional curanto.\n\n\"Kartoffelbrot\" is a potato bread that may contain spelt and rye flour.\n\n\"Berches\" is a German-Jewish bread made for Shabbat. Like other Ashkenazi challot, it is typically braided, but unlike the sweet, eggy challah of eastern Ashkenazi cuisine, \"berches\" bread contains boiled, mashed, and cooled potato, and has no egg and very little sugar in the dough. Some recipes contain oil, and some do not. It is often topped with an egg wash (even if there is no egg incorporated into the dough itself), and poppy seeds. While there are few German Jews left living in Germany, the tradition of making \"berches\" has been carried on by non-Jewish bakers, who are aware of the bread's Jewish history.\n\nPotato bread is a part of the cuisine of Hungary.\n\nIn Ireland, potato bread or cakes known as boxty () were popular, and may have been a result of the floury types of potatoes that were common in the country.\n\nPotato farls are one large round divided into four quadrants or square slices (usually around 0.5–1 cm in thickness) of soft potato bread, lightly powdered with flour and are common in Ulster, especially Northern Ireland. They are traditionally used as one of the distinguishing items of food in an Ulster fry, where they are shallow-fried on both sides for a short time and served with soda farls cooked in the same way. They can also be grilled and buttered, or eaten with a variety of toppings.\n\nApple potato cake or \"fadge\" was cooked in Ireland in autumn, when cooking apples were available, and very popular in the north-east of the country. Freshly cooked potatoes is mixed with melted butter, salt, and flour. It is a potato bread wrapped, pastry-like, around a sweet filling of apples.\n\n\"Okrągły chleb kartoflany\" is a light and airy potato bread.\n\nThe Scottish tattie scone, also known as a \"tottie scone\" or \"potato scone\", is similar to the Irish potato farl. They are generally shaped as one large round divided into four quadrants, in a similar fashion to traditional Scottish oatcakes, or as small rounds.\n\nPotato bread is commercially available in the United States as a light and airy bread very similar to normal mass-produced white bread, but with a yellow tint, thicker texture, and a light potato flavor.\n\nCherokee sweet potato bread is a variation on potato bread that uses sweet potatoes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944513", "title": "Openclipart", "text": "Openclipart\n\nOpenclipart is a community and collection of vector clip art that is free content. The project's slogan was, \"Openclipart is the largest community of artists making the best free original clipart for you to use for absolutely any reason.\" All of Openclipart's content was public domain, either due to expired copyright, failing to reach the threshold of originality, or deeded into the public domain to the greatest legal extent possible by its owners.\n\nThe website had been unavailable since April 2019. Access to the library via other means was still possible, including partial copies of the library that have been posted on several mirrors. The search feature was restored in May 2020.\n\nThe Openclipart library, sometimes abbreviated as OCAL (\"Open Clip Art Library\"), was started in early 2004 by Jon Phillips and Bryce Harrington, developers for vector graphics software Sodipodi, and later its fork, Inkscape. Openclipart initially grew out of a project started by Christian Schaller (Uraeus), who on October 26, 2003 issued a challenge on the Gnome Desktop website for users of Sodipodi to create a collection of flags in SVG format. The flag project progressed very well, resulting in a collection of over 90 flags made publicly available in SVG format, which led to a broadening of the project goals to include generic clipart. The project became known as Openclipart by April 2004, with the stated aim of all contributed images being dedicated to the public domain.\n\nIn the early stages of the Openclipart project, a website was created that lacked thumbnails and was hard to browse. To help propagate the images in the library, downloadable Openclipart packages were released. These packages were available directly from the Openclipart website, or as an add-on for various Linux distributions including Fedora, or an NSIS installer for Windows. Each package included most of the clipart to date and were manually sorted into categories, a laborious process. The Openclipart package version 0.20 was released in 2010. The Openclipart packages received only a few more incremental updates during 2010, mostly for seasonal clipart.\n\nAn overhauled Openclipart 2.0 website went live as a beta in February 2010 with a full release in March 2010. The site introduced a change from the old ccHost software to the new AGPL-based Aiki Framework, a content management system made for Openclipart 2.0. The new site allowed anyone to browse and add to the Openclipart collection easily, and image thumbnails and improved search functions made the Openclipart library more accessible. These features contributed to increased use of the site, which was soon receiving over 5,000 unique visitors and 50,000 page views daily, and soon made the old packages redundant. This release culminated the work of Jon Phillips, Andy Fitzsimon, Bassel Safadi, Michi, Ronaldo Barbachano, and Brad Phillips who assisted in the launch of the new system.\n\nThe 3.0 website release incorporated a \"favoriting\" feature, allowing members to make note of their favorite clip art, and an image-editing option that makes the remixing of images significantly easier.\n\nOn April 15, 2013, Openclipart launched a new logo and updated website design using a \"scissors\" logo.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, Openclipart announced that Inkpad, an open source drawing app for Apple iPad, released library integration so that the entire collection is available to artists.\n\nOn April 19, 2019 the site was taken offline by what was initially reported as a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS). Jon Philips, one of the site's founders, appeared to be a victim of identity theft, making it unclear whether the earlier reports of a DDoS attack were true. Since the shutdown, all pages on OpenClipart.org have redirected to a page asking users to donate money \"to support protection.\" The message was updated December 25 with a statement that the site was being \"gifted to the community\" and that new files could once again be uploaded to the library; users of the site still cannot search or access existing files through the site.\n\nWhen it became apparent that the site was not going to come back up some users discovered that the art files themselves were still available and used software to download (scrape) them. Using this technique 156,000 images, constituting the vast majority of the library, were recovered and put up on FreeSVG.org. A second mirror was established at FreeSVGClipArt.com, taking advantage of the clips' lack of licensing restrictions.\n\nSome Linux distributions, including Mandriva and Ubuntu, include many of the Openclipart collection releases, packaged as SVG, PNG or OpenDocument format files. These distributions are based on the 2005 pre-ccHost release, since regular releases stopped after the switch to ccHost software. Openclipart 0.19, the first version released after switch, was released in March 2009. With the recent release of version 2.0 and updated packages, distributions have bugs filed in their respective bug trackers to begin packaging Openclipart once more.\n\nOpenclipart was included on the cover discs in Linux Format issues 123 and 132 as a package of browseable SVG files from the Openclipart collection.\n\n\n"}

The first runners must begin in the same stagger as for the individual 400 m race. A relay baton is carried by each runner. Prior to 2018, the baton had to be passed within a 20 m changeover box, preceded by a 10-metre acceleration zone. With a rule change effective November 1, 2017 that zone was modified to include the acceleration zone as part of the passing zone, making the entire zone 30 metres in length. The outgoing runner cannot touch the baton until it has entered the zone, the incoming runner cannot touch the baton after it has left the zone. The zone is usually marked in yellow, frequently using lines, triangles or chevrons. While the rule book specifies the exact positioning of the marks, the colors and style are only \"recommended\". While most legacy tracks will still have the older markings, the rule change still uses existing marks. Not all governing body jurisdictions have adopted the rule change.\n\nTransfer of the baton in this race is typically blind. The outgoing runner reaches a straight arm backwards when they enter the changeover box, or when the incoming runner makes a verbal signal. The outgoing runner does not look backwards, and it is the responsibility of the incoming runner to thrust the baton into the outstretched hand, and not let go until the outgoing runner takes hold of it without crossing the changeover box and to stop after baton is exchanged. Runners on the first and third legs typically run on the inside of the lane with the baton in their right hand, while runners on the second and fourth legs take the baton in their left. Polished handovers can compensate for a lack of basic speed to some extent, and disqualification for dropping the baton or failing to transfer it within the box is common, even at the highest level.\n\nThe United States men and women historically dominated this event through the 20th century, winning the most Olympic gold medals and the most IAAF world championships. Carl Lewis ran the anchor leg on U.S. relay teams that set six world records from 1983 to 1992, including the first team to break 38 seconds.\n\nThe current men's world record stands at 36.84, set by the Jamaican team at the Final of the 2012 London Olympic Games on 11 August 2012. As the only team to break 37 seconds to date, Jamaica has been the dominant team in the sport, winning two consecutive Olympic Gold Medals as well as four consecutive World Championships. The previous record was 37.04 seconds as set by the Jamaican team at the 2011 World Championships.\n\nThe fastest electronically timed anchor leg run is 8.65 seconds by Usain Bolt at the 2015 IAAF World Relays, while Bob Hayes was hand-timed as running 8.7 seconds on a cinder track in the 1964 Tokyo Games Final.\n\nThe women's world record stands at 40.82 seconds, set by the United States in 2012 at the London Olympics. The fastest anchor leg run by a woman is 9.70 by Carmelita Jeter.\n\nAccording to the IAAF rules, world records in relays can only be set if all team members have the same nationality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His paternal grandfather was Charles Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough, and his paternal grandmother Lady Gainsborough was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria. Noel's parents were both Anglican, though in his youth, Noel repudiated the Calvinism of his mother and attended higher-church services with his father.\n\nHe was educated at Wellington College and at Cheltenham College, then also an all-boys public school. He then entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, but was rusticated (suspended) for a year and chose not to return to complete his degree.\n\nNoel underwent training for ordination at Chichester Theological College, an Anglo-Catholic theological school. At first he was refused ordination into the Church of England because of his theological views: he had been offered a curacy at All Saints Church in Plymouth, but on the day on which he was scheduled to be ordained, the Bishop of Exeter refused to ordain him.\n\nIn 1894, he was ordained deacon in the Diocese of Chester and became a curate in Flowery Field, Cheshire, but left following parishioners' objections to his socialism. He also spent time as a curate at St Philip's in Newcastle, under W. E. Moll. Also in 1894, he married Miriam Greenwood. In late 1904 he became assistant priest to Percy Dearmer at Primrose Hill.\n\nIn 1910, he became the vicar of Thaxted, Essex presented by the patron of the living Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, who was herself a socialist.\n\nWithin the church at Thaxted, Noel hung the red flag and the flag of Sinn Féin alongside the flag of Saint George. This led to the \"Battle of the Flags\" with students from Cambridge leading attacks on the church to remove the flags. Eventually, in 1922 a consistory court ruled against displaying the flags and Noel obeyed the ruling.\n\nHe founded the socialist organization Catholic Crusade in 1918, which had some impact in the origins of Trotskyism in Britain.\n\nOn Noel's perspective on the Middle Ages, which was similar to that of William Morris and John Ruskin, Reginald Groves wrote:\nHaving become a socialist shortly after finishing his university studies, he joined the Social Democratic Federation. He joined the Independent Labour Party, but in 1911 became a member of the British Socialist Party.\n\nNoel also supported the British Provisional Committee for the Defence of Leon Trotsky, and signed a letter defending Trotsky's right to asylum and calling for an international inquiry into the Moscow Trials.\n\nHe was a friend of the composer Gustav Holst who lived for some years in the village.\n\nHe died of cancer on 22 July 1942. A sculpture by Gertrude Hermes is in Thaxted church.\n\n\n"}

The four chests containing the papers were supposedly discovered during the making of a documentary, in the presence of members of the Western press. In fact the agency itself had placed them there, in collaboration with the KGB.\n\nThe papers were possibly genuine, although former Czechoslovak spy Josef Frolík described them in his 1975 memoirs as forgeries. However, their apparent discovery was a disinformation operation, the largest conducted by the agency; in fact the papers found in the sunken chests, which had been carefully doctored to appear as if they had been submerged since World War II, were not the real documents, which were only later brought from the Soviet Union. The agent who led the divers to make the discovery and who had originally placed them in the lake, Ladislav Bittman, (later known as Lawrence Martin-Bittman) defected to the West in 1968 and published a book on the plot. The objectives were to discredit Western politicians by revealing the names of former Nazi informants whom they were still using as spies in Eastern Europe, and to place pressure on West Germany to extend the statute of limitations on prosecution of war criminals. The operation had some temporary success, including extension of the statute of limitations.\n\nThe Czech civilian defence agency posted the files on Operation Neptune to its website.\n"}

He attended Chalvedon Comprehensive School until year 9 when he left to move full-time to the Sylvia Young Theatre School.\n\nHe enjoyed initial acting success with small parts in \"Casualty\", \"Hale and Pace\", \"The Bill\" and \"EastEnders\". Scott also performed on stage in London's West End & the Edinburgh Festival with \"Ron Moody\" in Peter Pan and in the National Youth Music Theatre Production of \"Whistle Down the Wind\" before turning his attention to music with Five.\n\nIn 1997, Robinson auditioned for Five, a new boy band-style group with \"attitude and edge\". Robinson was eventually selected to be part of the band along with Richard \"Abs\" Breen (now Abz Love), Ritchie Neville, Sean Conlon and Jason \"J\" Brown. Five subsequently were signed by Simon Cowell and BMG/RCA for a six-album deal. Five went on to enjoy massive success worldwide, selling over 20 million records in their four years together. The band split up on 27 September 2001, as Conlon had left the band, Neville had hurt himself on stage and Robinson's fiancée Kerry Oaker was having trouble with her pregnancy.\n\nAfter the split of Five, Robinson worked in radio and television, and was one of the leads in the UK regional touring musical, \"Boogie Nights 2\". He also joined his friend Chris Brooks at local Essex radio station, Essex FM, in 2002 for a few months as a radio DJ. He starred in the UK regional theatre musical \"Boogie Nights 2\" from late 2004 through most of 2005. He was a regular on \"Soccer AM\" at the beginning of the 2012-13 season, presenting the \"Scott from Five Awards\".\n\nScott occasionally gigs at JJ's, the UK's classiest club alongside his backing dancer.\n\nIn 2015 Scott with his friend Chris Brooks and Radio producer Alex Williamson launched a podcast called The Three Show.\n\nOn 17 September 2006, an announcement was made via Five's official Myspace page that a press conference was to be held at The Scala in central London on 27 September. After a venue change due to a shooting at The Scala, the conference was moved to the Bar Academy Islington where it was confirmed that four of the five members would be reuniting (Conlon now being committed to his Sony deal). Five recorded new material for what was to be their fourth studio album, working with Guy Chambers, Swedish producer/songwriter Anders Bagge, and French DJs Trak Invaders. They also planned to tour in 2007. By January 2007, Five had completed half of their album and were looking to be signed to a record label with new manager, Richard Beck. The album was expected to be released within the next few months. On 8 March 2007, at midnight, Five premiered one-minute clips of three brand new songs that were to have been on the new album. The songs, titled \"70 Days\", \"Settle Down\" and \"It's All Good\" can be heard on the band's official webpage and also on their Myspace page. Beck also secured an MTV documentary series titled \"Five - The Revive\".\n\nOn 19 May 2007, only eight months after reforming, having failed to secure a lucrative enough record deal, Five announced via their website that the group would no longer be pursuing a comeback. Between 2010 and 2012, Robinson and Love did a small tour performing music from their catalogue. They were the only members of the band who continued to make appearances performing songs from Five's back-catalogue.\n\nAfter Robinson's ex-bandmate Conlon appeared on \"The Voice UK\" on 24 March 2012 and failed to make it past the audition stage, Conlon reunited with his former bandmates to discuss the possibility of a second comeback.\n\nOn 19 April 2012, Brown wrote a post on Five fansite \"Warrington Warrior\", saying that he had decided not to be a part of the reunion, and that he would like the fansite to be shut down, claiming that he no longer wants to be in the public eye, as he felt it was an intrusion to his private life. Conlon, Neville, Love and Robinson confirmed the next day on Twitter that the post was indeed from Brown, and that they had received a letter with similar content from him. They apologised and gave a statement that Brown's personal opinion in no way represents Five as a band. The forum thread containing Brown's message has since been deleted, as per Robinson's and their manager's request. The other members then stated that they would continue as a four-piece, with plans for a new tour and new material.\n\nOn 17 October 2012, Robinson revealed via Twitter that Five had would be taking part in an ITV2 series called \"The Big Reunion\" at some point in 2013. In January 2013, it was reported that Five were looking to find a new member to replace Brown, and they were also having disagreement over the group's name. The band eventually decided to continue as a four-piece, and took part in a gig at the Hammersmith Apollo and later The Big Reunion arena tour.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Five and the boy bands from both series of \"The Big Reunion\" would go on The Big Reunion Boyband Tour later in the year. Abz revealed that he would not be taking part for financial reasons. Five reassured fans that Abz was not quitting the band altogether, but on 29 August he announced his departure via Twitter without letting Robinson, Conlon or Neville know first. Five are now continuing with just three members.\n\nAs of 26 October 2008, Robinson appeared in \"Celebrity Scissorhands\" which coincides with the BBC charity \"Children in Need\". He got into the final on 9 November after the contestants made an anonymous vote. He also appeared on an episode of \"Test the Nation\" in the Robinsons group.\n\nOn 11 July 2001, Robinson's fiancée Kerry Oaker gave birth five weeks early to their first son, Brennan Rhys Robinson. On 28 September 2001, the day after Five split up, Robinson and Oaker got married, with all Robinson's bandmates in attendance.. The family currently live in Pitsea, Essex. On 8 September 2013, it was announced that Robinson and Oaker were expecting twins in January 2014. They welcomed twin girls, Bobbi-Rayne and Kayde-Rose, on 17 January 2014.\n\nRobinson is a fan of Arsenal F.C.\n\n\n"}

As a political advisor he was involved in two political scandals, \"Lobbygate\" in 1998, and again in 2009 while Draper was editor of the LabourList website. He has worked as a psychotherapist.\n\nHe is the author of two books, \"Blair's 100 Days\" and \"Life Support\".\n\nBorn in Chorley, Lancashire, Draper was educated at Southlands High School there, graduating in 1984. He later attended Runshaw College in Leyland and the University of Manchester. While at the university, Draper provided hospitality for Ken Livingstone, who had missed his train after a Labour Club meeting. Livingstone was reportedly astonished to find displayed in Draper's student room an improbably large poster of Labour Party deputy leader, Roy Hattersley. At around this time, he first met Charlotte Raven, with whom he was later involved romantically.\n\nDraper began his political career in 1990, when he became the constituency secretary for Nick Brown. In 1992, he left this job and went to work as a researcher for the MP for Hartlepool, Peter Mandelson. In 1996, he became a director of a lobbying firm called GPC Market Access, and was employed by them until early 1999. While working at GPC Market Access, he set up the New Labour organisation Progress with Liam Byrne. During the late 1990s, Draper worked as the Political Editor of the \"Modern Review\", was briefly a columnist for the \"Daily Express\", and a presenter on Talk Radio UK.\n\nIn 1998, while still working as a director at GPC Market Access, Draper was caught on tape, with Jonathan Mendelsohn, boasting to Greg Palast – an undercover reporter from \"The Observer\" posing as a businessman – about how they could sell access to government ministers and create tax breaks for their clients. When the tabloids got hold of the story, they dubbed it \"Lobbygate\". On the recording, Draper said that \"there are 17 people who count in this government ... [to] say I am intimate with every one of them is the understatement of the century.\" Palast also wrote that Draper said, regarding his motivation: \"I just want to stuff my bank account at 250 pounds an hour\". According to Palast, \"Draper was nothing more than a messenger boy, a factotum, a purveyor, a self-loving, over-scented clerk\". Although he denied the allegations and accused \"The Observer\" of attempting to entrap him, he was widely ridiculed in the aftermath. Palast later stated that the subsequent media coverage got his original story wrong, and that it was not primarily about boastful lobbyists: \"the real story was about Tony Blair and his inner circle\".\n\nFollowing his involvement in the \"Lobbygate\" scandal, Draper was sacked from his job at the \"Daily Express\" and generally shunned by Labour insiders. His friend Peter Mandelson said that Draper \"[h]as a fine intelligence, but sometimes I am afraid he misuses that intelligence. He gets above himself. But now he has been cut down to size and I think probably he will learn a very hard lesson from what has happened.\"\n\nAfter leaving politics, Draper retrained as a psychotherapist, obtaining an MA in clinical psychology after what he described as \"three years in Berkeley, California\". While in Berkeley, he worked as \"the development director of a community counselling centre\"; later, he claimed to have entered \"private practice in Marylebone, London\". He subsequently clarified that he in fact studied at the Wright Institute of California, a graduate school in the town of Berkeley founded by Nevitt Sanford. Draper responded to the controversy surrounding his claimed psychotherapy degree, by denying the allegations completely and saying that this was \"a brazen attempt to smear me by Guido Fawkes and David Hencke\". He stated in 2009 that he was considering taking legal action against them, but never did.\n\nDraper is a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). He writes an occasional column for the \"Mail on Sunday\" newspaper on psychotherapy issues and also wrote monthly columns in the magazines \"Psychologies\" and \"Therapy Today\". He is also the author of a chapter in \"The Future of the NHS\".\n\nIn response to a formal complaint the BACP announced on 24 November 2009 that it had It further clarified Draper's qualifications: \n\nIn the 2005 General Election Draper urged people to vote tactically against Labour, saying, \"I don't want my vote to be used as vindication for Tony Blair, I'd like him to wake up after the election and feel like a hunted man\".\n\nOn 7 June 2009, emails that were highly critical of Gordon Brown that Peter Mandelson sent Draper in January 2008 were leaked to the \"News of the World\" which claimed that Brown was \"insecure\" and a \"self-conscious person, physically and emotionally\".\n\nDuring 2008, Draper made a return to British politics. He was described on the BBC television current affairs programme \"Newsnight\", on 12 September 2008, as a Labour Campaign Advisor. Draper's position at that time was as an unpaid adviser to Ray Collins, the then General Secretary of the Labour Party.\n\nDraper was the founder and editor of LabourList website, which was launched in January 2009. He explained that he started the website in response to the increasing role that the internet was playing in British politics and so that Labourites would have their own place on the blogosphere. Contributors to his website included David Lammy, Peter Mandelson, James Purnell and Piers Morgan. Although LabourList was generally supportive of the Labour Party, it claimed to publish articles and views critical of the Labour government.\n\nOn 11 April 2009, it was reported by \"The Daily Telegraph\" that Gordon Brown's special adviser, Damian McBride, had sent a series of emails to Draper discussing plans to set up a blog which would be used to post false rumours about the private lives of senior or prominent members of the Conservative Party and their spouses. These smears would have included sexual and personal fabrications against MP Nadine Dorries, Conservative leader David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, and Shadow Chancellor George Osborne and his wife Frances.\n\nThe emails, which had been sent from the Downing Street Press Office, found their way to Paul Staines, who brought them to the attention of the media. McBride resigned later the same day, and 10 Downing Street issued an apology for the \"juvenile and inappropriate\" emails. Gordon Brown sent personal letters to those who had been mentioned in the emails, expressing his regret over the incident, but Conservative politicians called for him to make a public apology. Brown apologised a few days later while on a visit to Glasgow, saying that he was sorry about what had happened.\n\nDraper later apologised for his part in the affair. Although in his reply to McBride's email he had described the idea as \"absolutely totally brilliant\", Draper claimed that he only responded to the email to gain favour from Downing Street for LabourList. A closer examination of Draper's emailed reply shows the plot was far more advanced, with Draper knowing that the controversial Red Rag blogsite had already been set up and offering to sort out the technology with trade union official Andrew Dodgshon.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, Labour sought to distance itself from Draper's LabourList blog, saying that his website is not owned by the Labour Party. Draper also came under pressure to resign his post as editor of LabourList, which he did in early May, saying \"I regret ever receiving the infamous email and I regret my stupid, hasty reply. I should have said straight away that the idea was wrong.\"\n\nOn 23 May 2019, Draper announced he had resigned his Labour Party membership of 35 years. In a statement, Draper announced: \n\nDraper married GMTV presenter Kate Garraway in 2005 in Camden, London. Draper was hospitalised in April 2020 suffering with Covid-19 and admitted to the intensive care unit.\n\n"}
{"id": "1944555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944555", "title": "MACRS", "text": "MACRS\n\nThe Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) is the current tax depreciation system in the United States. Under this system, the capitalized cost (basis) of tangible property is recovered over a specified life by annual deductions for depreciation. The lives are specified broadly in the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes detailed tables of lives by classes of assets. The deduction for depreciation is computed under one of two methods (declining balance switching to straight line or straight line) at the election of the taxpayer, with limitations. See IRS Publication 946 for a 120-page guide to MACRS.\n\nTax deductions for depreciation have been allowed in the U.S. since the inception of the income tax. Prior to 1971, these deductions could be computed in a variety of manners over a wide range of lives, under old Bulletin F. In 1971, Congress introduced the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system in an attempt to simplify calculations and provide some uniformity. Under ADR, the IRS prescribed lives for classes of assets based on the nature or use of the asset. Such classes included general classes (such as office equipment) and industry classes (such as assets used in the manufacture of rubber goods). Taxpayers could use their choice of several methods of depreciating assets, including straight line, declining balance, and sum of years digits. Asset costs and accumulated depreciation were tracked by \"vintage accounts\" consisting of all assets within a class acquired in a particular tax year. All vintage accounts for the same year were assumed placed in service in the middle of the year; however, a taxpayer could elect the modified half year convention with potentially favorable results.\n\nIn 1981, Congress again changed the depreciation system, providing generally for shorter lives for recovery of costs. Under the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), broad groups of assets were assigned based on the old ADR lives (which the IRS has updated since). Taxpayers were permitted to calculate depreciation only under the declining balance method switching to straight line or the straight line method. Other changes applied as well.\n\nThe present MACRS system was adopted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n\nCalifornia is the only state which does not fully conform its depreciation schedule to MACRS.\n\nUnder MACRS a taxpayer must compute tax deductions for depreciation of tangible property using specified lives and methods. Assets are divided into classes by type of asset or by business in which the asset is used. (See tables of classes below.) Where a general class based on the nature of the asset applies (00.xx classes below), that class takes precedence over the use class.\n\nFor each class, three lives are specified: one for regular depreciation (GDS in the tables below), one for the alternative depreciation system (ADS), and a class life. Taxpayers may be required to use ADS or otherwise may elect which of the three lives to use. Lives for personal property vary from 3 years to 20 years. Land improvements must be depreciated over 15 or 20 years. Other real property must be depreciated over 27.5 years for residential property, 39 years for business property, and 40 years under ADS.\n\nIn addition, shorter lives are provided for certain property, including computers and peripheral equipment, certain high technology equipment, special purpose agricultural structures, and certain other items. MACRS also excluded certain property in regulated industries, as well as films, video tapes, and sound recordings, and certain other items. Also, leasehold improvements to realty are generally treated as real property under MACRS.\n\nOnly the declining balance method and straight line method of computing depreciation are allowed under MACRS. Taxpayers using the declining balance change to the straight line method at the point at which depreciation deductions are optimized. See the tables below. All tangible personal property acquired during the year is considered placed in service in the middle of the tax year (\"half-year convention\"). Real property is considered placed in service in the middle of the month in which acquired (\"mid-month convention\"). Special rules apply for pro rating deductions for short tax years and for the first year of business, or where more than 40% of tangible personal property additions are in the final quarter of the year.\n\nThe method and life used in depreciating an asset is an accounting method, change of which requires IRS approval.\n\nTaxpayers may track the basis and accumulated depreciation of assets individually or in vintage accounts, as in the old ADR system. Where assets are tracked in vintage accounts, a first-in-first-out convention is usually applied to determine basis of assets retired.\n\nAt various times, additional depreciation deductions have been allowed to encourage investment. These allowances generally have had limitations. For example, an additional deduction of 50% of the cost of qualifying property is allowed for certain property acquired after December 31, 2007 and before January 1, 2011 A nearly identical allowance was available for property acquired after September 10, 2001 and before 2005. The IRS recently issued guidance clarifying when taxpayers are eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation. In addition, the guidance provides procedures for electing 100 percent bonus depreciation and 50 percent bonus depreciation for certain property. In addition to extending the availability of bonus depreciation in general, the Tax Relief Act provided for a new 100 percent depreciation deduction for qualified property that is acquired and placed into service by the taxpayer between September 8, 2010, and January 1, 2014. Special rules have also applied for bio fuel, recycling, and disaster assistance property.\n\n\"Decoupling modification\" is a tax terminology resulting from the federal tax law enacted March 9, 2002, which created a new tax deduction for \"bonus depreciation\" that threatened to cost states very large amounts of revenue. Federal Bonus Depreciation, Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, allows the acceleration of depreciation on federal tax returns, for example, writing off a higher amount of depreciation for the first year an asset goes into service. States that refuse to accept this method of calculating depreciation for state taxes, for example, Iowa and Maryland, publish forms with instructions so stating.\n\nCertain assets must be depreciated under the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS), using specified lives and the straight line method. It may be applied at the election of the taxpayer in lieu of regular depreciation, and it must be used for the following types of property:\n\nIn addition, the ADS must be used for computing depreciation deductions for the Alternative Minimum Tax. ADS lives are the same as regular depreciation lives for a few classes, but are generally somewhat longer than regular lives for most classes.\n\nThe following example is extracted from IRS Publication 946:\n\nYou bought office furniture (7-year property) for $10,000 and placed it in service on October 13, 2013. You use the furniture only for business.\n\nA taxpayer may group assets together into a general asset account. The grouped assets must have the same life, method of depreciation, convention, additional first year depreciation percentage, and year (or quarter or month) placed in service. Listed property or vehicles cannot be grouped with other assets. Depreciation for the account is computed as if the entire account were a single asset.\n\nGain or loss may be deferred or recognized on retirement of assets under MACRS, at the taxpayer's election. Under default rules, proceeds from disposing of a depreciable asset in a multiple asset account are recognized as ordinary income, and depreciation on the account is unaffected by the retirement. An optional method allows the asset to be removed from the account at the start of the year from retirement, in which case gain or loss is on the asset is subject to regular rules.\n\nFrom IRS Publication 946 Excerpt from Table B-1 (many asset classes omitted here)\n\n\nFrom IRS Publication 946 Table A-1. Other tables are available for options different from those shown below.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Trinity then defeated Desire in a singles match on February 5 before later defeating ODB on February 26. On March 19, Trinity became the first woman in TNA history to compete for one of the promotion's male championships, as she wrestled against Kid Kash and Amazing Red in a three-way match for Kash's X Division Championship, but was unable to win the title. In June, Trinity turned heel by choking out Goldylocks backstage, and would solidify her heel turn by aligning with Vince Russo the following week. In April 2004, Finochio formed the New York Connection (NYC) alongside Glenn Gilbertti, Vito LoGrasso, and Johnny Swinger. The NYC had their first match together on April 28, where Trinity, Gilbertti, and Swinger lost to Desire, Pat Kenney, and Sonny Siaki before losing a rematch on June 3 in a dark match before the inaugural episode of \"Impact!\". Trinity then began feuding with Desire, and proceeded to defeat her in a stretcher match on June 23 and then again in a mixed tag team match on July 7 to end the feud. At the inaugural Victory Road pay-per-view on November 7, 2004, the evil Trinity defeated Jacqueline Moore in an open challenge.\n\nAfter the NYC disbanded, Trinity entered into an angle with Tracy Brooks and TNA's Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes over the position of Rhodes' personal assistant. Brooks eventually won the job after her team of The Disciples of Destruction defeated Trinity's team, Phi Delta Slam, at the inaugural Destination X pay-per-view on March 13, 2005. Trinity then became the manager of Michael Shane and resumed her feud with Brooks, who became the manager of Chris Sabin. At the inaugural Hard Justice pay-per-view, Trinity and Shane were defeated by Brooks and Sabin after Brooks turned on Sabin and Shane turned on Trinity.\n\nOn March 17, 2013, Trinity made her return to TNA at one of their One Night Only shows, Knockouts Knockdown, which aired on September 6, 2013. At the PPV, Trinity competed as a villainess and was defeated by ODB.\n\nAfter leaving TNA, Finochio received a try-out match with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where she and Chris Cage lost to Beth Phoenix and Aaron Stevens on November 9, 2005. After appearing on the January 6, 2006 episode of \"Heat\" alongside Talia Madison in a segment with The Heart Throbs, WWE officially signed Finochio to a contract. She was then placed in WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling, where she made her debut on March 22, 2006 as the special guest referee in a match between Shelly Martinez and Beth Phoenix, which Phoenix won. Finochio, as Trinity, made her in-ring debut for OVW on March 29 in a match against Sosay that ended in a no-contest after she was attacked by Phoenix. In response to the attack, Trinity wrestled against Phoenix on April 5, but was defeated.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\", Trinity made her WWE debut as the manager for The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido, Tony Mamaluke and Big Guido). On June 24 at an ECW house show, Finochio injured her knee after executing a moonsault from the top rope to the outside of the ring during a catfight with Kelly Kelly and Francine that stemmed from Francine winning a bikini contest earlier in the night. She underwent surgery a few days later, and was given a recovery time of six to eight weeks.\n\nFinochio made her return on October 7, where she lost to Jazz in a singles match at a house show. She lost to Jazz in a rematch the next night. On the October 31 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\", Trinity won the first ever ECW Diva Halloween Costume Contest after being voted over Kelly Kelly and Ariel. On January 13, 2007, Trinity teamed with fellow ECW Diva Kelly Kelly in a losing effort to Michelle McCool and Jillian Hall at a house show. The following day, Trinity wrestled her final match in WWE as she and Kelly lost to McCool and Hall in a rematch.\n\nFinochio was later released from her WWE contract on June 22, 2007.\n\nAfter being released from WWE, Finochio retired from professional wrestling in order to concentrate on her stunt work. On September 20, 2008, Finochio made a one-night return to wrestling under her old Stephanie Starr ring name, where she lost a three-way match to Peggy Lee Leather, that also involved Fantasy. On April 19, 2012, Finochio began competing in roller derby as a member of the Strong Island Derby Revolution.\n\n\n\nFinochio was born and raised in Long Island, New York, where she graduated from Lindenhurst Senior High School in 1989 before later graduating from Dowling College in 1994 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting and a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. She later returned to Dowling and earned a master's degree in education in 2000.\n\nFinochio has over twenty years of experience as a dancer and is a certified aerobics instructor.\n\n"}
{"id": "1944587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944587", "title": "James Anderson (cricketer)", "text": "James Anderson (cricketer)\n\nJames Michael Anderson, (born 30 July 1982), usually known as Jimmy Anderson, is an English international cricketer who plays for Lancashire County Cricket Club and the England cricket team. Anderson is the all-time leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers surpassing Glenn McGrath (563 wickets) and holds the record of most wickets for England in both Test and One-Day International (ODI) cricket. He is the only English bowler, and the 6th overall, to pass 500 Test wickets.Anderson is also a co-presenter alongside Greg James and Felix White on the Tailenders podcast. \n\nAnderson plays first-class cricket for Lancashire county cricket club and since arriving on the international scene in 2002/03 (before his first full season of County cricket) has represented England in 150 Test matches and nearly 200 One Day Internationals. He is England's all-time highest international wicket-taker when combined across all three formats.\n\nA right-arm pace bowler, Anderson made his international debut at the age of just 20, on England's 2002/03 tour of Australia. When he played his first ODI he had only played five List A matches. Anderson went on to feature in the 2003 ICC World Cup and made his Test match debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's the next summer. Later in 2003, he experienced a dip in form and confidence against South Africa. After this, he was in and out of the team and experienced numerous injuries, including a stress fracture of the back which kept him out of action for most of the 2006 season. He returned to action and is now the opening bowler in England's Test team. He was a regular strike bowler in England's one-day team but has not played in that format since the 2015 World Cup. He is the first English bowler to reach 400 and 500 wickets in Test matches, and on 11 September 2018, he became 4th highest Test wicket-taker of all time. He reached this position when he took his 564th Test wicket, passing Glenn McGrath as the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers. he is ranked No.8 in the ICC Test Bowling Rankings, having previously reached the top position at various times between 2016 and 2018.\n\nOn 25 July 2016, during the second Test of that year's England-Pakistan series at Old Trafford, he became the first fast bowler to take 50 wickets against all other 7 major Test-playing nations, Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies. In December 2019, in the first Test against South Africa, Anderson became the ninth cricketer to play in 150 Test matches. In January 2020, in the second Test of the series against South Africa, Anderson took his 28th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. He surpassed Sir Ian Botham's record of 27, to become the bowler with the most five-wicket hauls for England in Test cricket.\n\nOn the occasion of England's 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country's greatest Test XI by the ECB.\n\nJames Anderson was a pupil at St Mary's and St Theodore's RC High School, Burnley. He played cricket at Burnley Cricket Club from a young age. His childhood dream was to be a cricketer, and at the age of 17, after a growth spurt, Anderson was one of the fastest bowlers in the Lancashire League. He stated that \"I've always bowled seam, but when I was about 17 I don't know what it was but I just started bowling fast all of a sudden\".\n\nJust months after his debut he had become one of the biggest stars in English cricket. Continuous alteration of hair styles, attractive looks, and up-to-the-minute outfits earned him comparisons with some of the most recognisable sports personalities around, including David Beckham. In 2006, at Holy Angels' RC Church, Hale, he married Daniella Lloyd, a model he met in 2004 while on England duty in London; he stated that marriage has made him \"a much happier person\". On 8 January 2009, Daniella Anderson gave birth to a baby girl, Lola Rose. The couple's second daughter, Ruby Luxe, was born on 9 December 2010.\n\nAnderson has ventured into fashion design since 2012, designing for Elvis Jesus with proceeds of the sale going to his sponsored charity, Nordoff-Robbins. In April 2014, he launched his first collection with London-based menswear brand, Chess London. He has stated that he would like to be \"the first cricketer to become a designer\". He launched his own menswear brand in late October 2014, and has been working in conjunction with British watchmaker Harold Pinchbeck to release a watch in 2015.\n\nAnderson became the first cricketer to model naked for \"Attitude\", \"Britain's biggest-selling gay magazine\", in September 2010. He stated \"if there are any gay cricketers they should feel confident enough to come out because I don't think there is any homophobia in cricket.\"\n\nAlongside former cricketer Graeme Swann and BBC Radio 1 radio presenter Greg James, Anderson hosts a cricket-themed radio show on BBC Radio 5 Live, \"Not Just Cricket\". The radio show was nominated for Best Sports Programme at the 2013 Radio Academy Awards.\n\nOn 15 November 2017, Anderson along with Felix White and Greg James, began hosting a cricketing podcast 'Tailenders'. This was initially a weekly podcast covering the 2017–18 Ashes series, since 23 May 2018 it was renewed to continue on a weekly basis.[9] Features include 'General Cricketing Sadness', 'Mattchin's Quiz' and 'Black Wednesday/Xmas Show/App Launch'.\n\nAnderson made his first-class debut for Lancashire in 2002; he played 13 matches and took 50 wickets at an average of 22.28, including three five-wicket hauls. He was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for Lancashire's most promising young County player in the 2002 season. In 2003, Anderson became the youngest player to take a hat-trick for Lancashire, just a week before his Test match debut against Zimbabwe; it was the first hat-trick at Old Trafford in eight years. In a match against Worcestershire in May 2004, Anderson recorded his maiden first-class ten-wicket haul.\n\n2005 was Anderson's first full season for Lancashire. He was propelled into the England side soon after his Lancashire debut and had returned to rediscover his form after winter tours with England where he had spent the majority of his time on the sidelines, and when given a chance for England he often bowled poorly due to a lack of match practice. He finished the season with 60 first-class wickets at an average of 30.21 and 27 one day wickets at an average of 22.00.\n\nAnderson was prevented from playing much for Lancashire in the 2006 season by a stress fracture of the back sustained in early May.\nHe played in only two matches for Lancashire, and at one point it was considered sending Anderson to play for Glamorgan to prove his fitness; however, Lancashire decided they would rather have Anderson play for them if only in a limited capacity. In the only first-class match he played for Lancashire that season, he was limited to three four-over spells by the ECB who were wary of injuring him again.\n\nIn 2008, after the Test and One-Day series against South Africa ended at the beginning of September, Anderson was made unavailable to play for Lancashire for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 20 first-class wickets at 7.75 for Lancashire.\n\nAt the start of the 2009 English cricket season, Anderson took career-best match figures in a first-class match with 11/109 against Sussex as Lancashire won by 8 wickets. It was the only first-class match he played for Lancashire before being called into the England squad for a series against the West Indies. As of 26 April 2009, Anderson had taken 188 wickets at 24.37 from 48 first-class matches with Lancashire, and 66 wickets at 21.78 in 44 list A matches.\n\nWhen Anderson was selected for the England one-day squad, he had played only five List A matches, taking 9 wickets at an average of 26.75. At the age of 20, he made his ODI debut on 15 December 2002 against Australia at Melbourne. He opened the bowling and recorded figures of 1/46 from six overs. His debut came before he was even awarded his County cap, which occurred in 2003. He showed good promise in this series – a three-team tournament also including Sri Lanka – which earned him a place in the 2003 World Cup squad. It was here that he really broke into international cricket with a match-winning spell against Pakistan, where he took four wickets in day/night game to collect the Man of the Match award. In what proved to be England's last match of the tournament he conceded 12 runs off the penultimate over against eventual world champions Australia, and England lost a closely fought contest.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, he made his first Test cricket appearance against Zimbabwe at Lord's, and took five wickets in an innings on debut, becoming the 42nd Englishman to do so. His success continued in the subsequent One-Day tournaments against Pakistan (against whom he took a hat-trick at The Oval), South Africa and Zimbabwe. His hat-trick against Pakistan, the first by an English bowler in an ODI, claimed the wickets of Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami.\n\nThe Test series against South Africa dented Anderson's reputation as England's golden boy; in a series England drew 2–2 after coming from behind, Anderson finished the five-match series with 15 wickets at an average of 39.86. His best figures of 5/102 came at Trent Bridge in the third Test where he used movement of the seam to claim his second five-wicket haul in his fifth Test. Although Anderson was England's lead wicket taker, Graeme Smith – the South African captain – particularly punished Anderson's bowling, taking 157 runs at a strike rate of 90.23 off his bowling in the series and only being dismissed once. In August, despite a mixed series against South Africa, Anderson was named Young Cricketer of the Year; he became the first player to be unanimously voted the award. In September, Anderson was awarded a central contract with the ECB. He suffered from a niggling knee injury and fatigue as the season wore on; the knee injury – to a tendon on the outside of his left knee – meant he was rested for the winter tour of Bangladesh. After the South Africa series and some good performances by other bowlers during the Bangladesh tour, Anderson admitted that he was no longer an automatic choice for England. England and Wales Cricket Board declared James Anderson as the England Cricketer of the year 2011–12.\n\nAnderson has an unusual bowling action. At the moment of delivery he has his head down, eyes closed and does not look where he is bowling; he attempted to bowl with his head up but found that he lost pace in doing so, so reverted to his original action. In 2003, ex-England pace bowler Bob Willis claimed that Anderson would only be able to play for five years with his action. Between 2004 and 2005, the England coaching staff attempted to alter Anderson's bowling action. Anderson was selected in the One-Day and Test squads for the winter tour Sri Lanka, but injuries left him able to play in only one of the three Tests on that tour. He bowled well below his potential to collect figures of 0–85 in his sole appearance.\n\nAlthough fit and included in both the Test and one-day squads for the tour of the West Indies, Anderson did not play in the Test series, having been superseded by players such as James Kirtley. He did feature in the ODI series which England drew 2–2, playing in 4 matches and taking 4 wickets at an average of 37.00; in the final match of the series, Anderson took his 50th ODI wicket, that of Chris Gayle for 41. After the ODI series against the West Indies, Anderson had 50 wickets from 31 ODIs at an average of 23.78.\n\nAnderson retained his place in the Test squad, and his next big break came when an injury to Simon Jones forced the Welshman out of the last three Tests of the 2004 summer series against the West Indies. Despite being in the team, Anderson's bowling was used infrequently. It was clear now that Anderson had now not only lost all his form and rhythm, but consequentially all his confidence as well. A performance by a resurgent Anderson in the final Test of the summer prompted speculation that he had regained his confidence and would return to the top of his game. He was selected for the winter tour to Zimbabwe and South Africa. Much of the post-season talk, however, was dominated by the debate over whether to go on tour to Zimbabwe. England eventually did end up in Harare, after a brief stop over in Namibia. Anderson once again struggled in his three One-Day appearances. The England management, however, continued to show faith in his ability.\n\nTravelling as a barely-used reserve on the winter South Africa tour while seemingly struggling for form, Anderson was given another shot at redemption, after Simon Jones was dropped for the third Test after a poor performance in the second. Anderson, though, did even worse than Jones, collecting figures of 2/117 and 0/32 in his two innings. Anderson spent the following summer with Lancashire; bowling regularly a quota of overs one would associate with a new ball bowler, something he had not done enough in his England stint. He was recalled to the England squad for the last match of the 2005 Ashes series after taking 60 wickets for Lancashire in 2005, once again as a replacement for the injured Jones, but all-rounder Paul Collingwood was selected for the team.\n\nAnderson was selected in the Test squad for the tour of Pakistan, but spinner Shaun Udal was chosen to fill the bowler's spot left empty by the still injured Simon Jones. When Ashley Giles had to miss the third Test due to injury, young Durham debutant seamer Liam Plunkett was chosen ahead of Anderson and Anderson did not play a single Test on the tour. Despite this disappointment he played in all five of England's One-Day games in Pakistan, showing improvements in form to be England's joint-leading wicket-taker in the series with Andrew Flintoff, taking 7 wickets at 25.57.\n\nAnderson was not selected for the senior side's tour to India in January 2006 as Simon Jones returned from injury and was chosen ahead of him. Instead, Anderson was selected for England A's tour of the West Indies. In February, days before the start of the first A-match between England and the West Indies, James Anderson (along with batsmen Alastair Cook and Owais Shah) was called up as an injury reinforcement to the England senior squad in India, after captain Michael Vaughan and fast bowler Simon Jones flew home with knee injuries and vice-captain Marcus Trescothick departed for undisclosed \"personal\" reasons. After an unconvincing display by Liam Plunkett in the second Test in Mohali Anderson was recalled for the final match of the series. He impressed in England's victory, taking figures of 4/40 in the first innings.\n\nAfter his impressive display in the final match in India, Anderson looked likely to feature as one of England's main bowlers in both the ODI series and Test matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka; however an early season stress fracture of the back ruled Anderson out for all of the summer internationals and all but two matches of his county season. Lancashire teammate Sajid Mahmood was called up to the England squad the replacement for Anderson.\n\nAnderson was named in England's Champions Trophy and Ashes squads in September 2006 although at that point he had not played any first-class cricket in six months. He was straight back into England colours for the 0–5 Ashes whitewash against Australia. His performance, like much of the England team, was well below standard. Anderson was sent home midway through the One-Day tournament with Australia and New Zealand as a precaution when he felt a twinge in his back; during the tournament he had begun to regain some of his form and in the four matches he played he took 8 wickets at an average of 20.62.\n\nAlthough Anderson was returned home early from the England's victorious ODI series in Australia, Anderson was selected in England's squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He recovered from his back injury and was expected to play ahead of the likes of Liam Plunkett, Sajid Mahmood and Jon Lewis. However, on 14 March 2007, only days before England's first game, it was reported by the BBC that Anderson had broken his finger during fielding practice and his involvement in the tournament was in question, although he was able to play despite the pain.\n\nWhen Peter Moores replaced Duncan Fletcher as England coach after the World Cup, it was felt that Anderson would benefit under new management; along with the rest of the England team he was allowed to play more for his county. It was felt that it was not beneficial for players who were not representing England to just sit on the sideline and match practice would allow him to rediscover his form. Anderson did not feature in the Test series against the West Indies, but he did play in the ODI series. During the second ODI, he clashed with Runako Morton when he appeared to get in the way of Morton when the batsman was running between the wickets. Anderson was fined half of his match fee for the incident and match referee Mike Procter stated \"James Anderson is not a player with a reputation for bad behaviour...and I am sure he will do everything he can to ensure there is no repeat of this unfortunate incident\". Anderson finished the series with five wickets at 30.40 as England lost the series 2–1.\n\nAnderson played in all three Tests of the series with India, coming into the side for the injured Matthew Hoggard and leading a pace attack comprising himself, Ryan Sidebottom and Chris Tremlett with only 20 caps between them. In the first Test of the series, Anderson claimed his 50th Test wicket when he dismissed Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 0; the feat was achieved in Anderson's 17th Test match and after the match he had 53 wickets at an average of 35.67. He became the first England bowler to dismiss Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, and Sourav Ganguly in the same innings. Although England lost the series, Anderson demonstrated greater consistency than before and managed 14 wickets, at 35.57 and getting the Man of the Series award. He also managed to get his name on the honours board at Lord's for the second time with his best Test figures of 5/42. The ODI series which followed was England's first ODI series win at home in three years. Anderson was the leading wicket-taker of either side with 14 wickets at an average of 22.57. In the first ODI of the series, Anderson claimed his 100th ODI wicket when he dismissed Gautam Gambhir for 3; after the match, he had taken 103 wickets from 70 matches at an average of 27.02. Anderson was also included for the England squad for the World Twenty20, held in September 2007, replacing an injured Ravi Bopara. He played in all four of England's matches, taking three wickets at 34.00, as England failed to progress beyond the second stage of the competition. Following a successful summer, he was one of twelve players awarded a central contract for 2007/08 by the ECB.\n\nAnderson was part of the squad which toured Sri Lanka in the winter. The One-Day side completed their first ever series victory in Sri Lanka; Anderson's contribution was four wickets in five matches at an average of 48.25 and tying down Sri Lanka's top order along with Sidebottom and Stuart Broad, although they finished with more wickets at a lower average. Despite suffering a bruised left ankle, Anderson was selected for the first Test. Although he bowled economically in the first innings, he was expensive in the second; during the course of the second innings he became only the second bowler in Test cricket to have six boundaries taken off a single over. He finished the match with figures of two wickets for 167 runs and was dropped for the final two Tests; his replacement was debutant Stuart Broad.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Anderson toured New Zealand with England. He played in the Twenty20 series, which England won 2–0, and he was then involved in the one-day series which New Zealand won 3–2. Although he played in all five matches of the One-Day series, he struggled and only managed four wickets at an average of 67.50. In an effort to regain some form, Anderson was allowed to join Auckland Cricket Club, who were lacking their strike bowlers due to international call ups, as an overseas player. The move was controversial with critics including Gavin Larsen, Wellington Cricket Club's chief executive, who feared that Anderson would be able to bowl himself into form. Although he was left out for the first Test, Anderson was recalled for the second when he and Stuart Broad replaced the out of form Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard after England were defeated by 189 runs; the decision to axe both bowlers was heralded as the end of an era in English cricket. Anderson's selection was a surprise as it was expected that Broad would replace Harmison, but not that Hoggard would be dropped. In the first innings of the second Test, Anderson took 5/73 and finished with match figures of 7/130 and helped England to a 126-run victory. He sustained an ankle injury while playing football before the third Test but recovered in time to be selected. Anderson's performance in the final Test was less effective, recording match figures of 1/153 as England won the match by 121 runs and the series 2–1. Searching for consistency, Anderson's action reverted to the action he used in 2003, one with which he felt comfortable.\nHe was retained for the home series, when New Zealand toured England later in 2008. He continued to enjoy success against the touring side, taking 19 wickets at 19.31 and finishing as the leading wicket-taker of the series. This was his highest return of wickets in a series. Anderson bowled well in the first Test, recording match figures of 130/5 as the match was drawn. In the second Test, Anderson finished with match figures of 5/139 as England won by six wickets; on the first day he struck New Zealand batsman Daniel Flynn in the face, knocking out a tooth, in a spell of short, aggressive bowling when he also hit Jacob Oram on the helmet. Anderson was disconcerted by injuring Flynn said that striking him \"wasn't pleasant\". In the final match of the series Anderson scored a career Test best of 28 in a partnership of 76 with Stuart Broad. This was followed up by career best bowling of 7/43 in the first innings and Test best match figures of 9/98 overall as he won the Man of the Match award and England secured an innings and nine run victory and a 2–0 series win. Anderson's performance in the series prompted England bowling coach Ottis Gibson to say that Anderson has the potential to become a world-class bowler if he can improve his self-belief. In the One-Day series that followed Anderson managed five wickets from five matches at an average of 41.40 as England lost the series 3–1.\n\nAfter the Test series against New Zealand, Anderson's figures revealed that he struggled to bowl to left-handed batsmen and his contrasting fortunes between the start of his career and his resurgence. By the end of June 2008, Anderson had played 25 Test matches; in the 16 Tests before July 2007 he took 46 wickets at an average of 38.39, but since then in 9 Tests he took 43 wickets at 30.58 at a much lower strike rate. In the five Tests Anderson played against New Zealand in a four-month period, 22 of the 27 wickets he managed were against right-handed batsmen. Against the right-handers he averaged 20.77 compared to 38.60 against left-handers. This was an improvement however on his career statistics, since he averaged 70 wickets at 29.11 against right-handers and 19 at 54.94 against left-handers. This first became clear in the 2003 Test series against South Africa when Graeme Smith and Gary Kirsten milked him for 276 runs while only being dismissed once between them.\n\nAnderson's batting showed a marked improvement in the summer's home Test series against South Africa. In the second innings of the second Test, at Headingley, Anderson scored a Test-career best 34 runs, having come to the crease as a nightwatchman late on Day 3. In the course of his innings he was struck on the wrist and then on the grille of his helmet by Dale Steyn.\n\nIn the final match of the series, Anderson took his 100th Test wicket. The landmark wicket was that of Jacques Kallis Leg Before Wicket for 2; this feat was achieved in Anderson's 29th Test and after the match he had 104 wickets at an average of 34.51.\n\nEngland's One-Day series in India was cut short due to terror attacks in Mumbai. Seven matches were due to be played, but due to the terrorism England flew home after five games. They were 5–0 down in the series and Anderson had not taken one wicket, despite bowling in every one of the five games.\n\nFollowing the sacking of Peter Moores in January 2009, and the replacement of Kevin Pietersen by Andrew Strauss as England captain, England left for a tour to the West Indies.\n\nFollowing two low-key performances in the warm-up matches against a St. Kitts XI and West Indies A, Anderson was dropped for the first Test in Jamaica. Surprisingly, the West Indies inflicted a large defeat on England, following a third innings batting collapse. With the form of Ryan Sidebottom a cause for concern, and some doubts over his fitness, Anderson was recalled for the second Test at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. However, this match was abandoned with fewer than two overs bowled due to an unfit outfield. The Test match was rearranged to take place two days later at the Antigua Recreation Ground. After making 4 as a night-watchman during England's first innings, Anderson bowled 19 wicketless overs as the West Indies were bowled out for 285, although he did take the catch of Chris Gayle off Steve Harmison. After making 20, again as night-watchman, in the second batting innings, England fell one wicket short of bowling the West Indies out and securing a Test victory as the tail-enders of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards survived 10 overs to bat out the draw.\n\nAfter sitting out the tour match against the BCA President's XI in Barbados, England and the West Indies played the fourth Test at the Kensington Oval. Both sides found bowling difficult on a very flat track, and the first two innings produced 1,349 runs for the loss of just 15 wickets. England batted first and made 600/6 declared, and Anderson again opened the bowling in the West Indies reply. After striking early to dismiss Chris Gayle LBW on a referral, he also dismissed Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Sulieman Benn, finishing with 3 for 125 from 37 overs. With England batting out the match, Anderson did not feature again as the Test match was drawn. With England still 1–0 down in a series they were expected by many to win comfortably, victory was needed in the fifth and final Test at Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad. After England made 546/6 declared, Anderson again struggled as the West Indies were bowled out for 544, a deficit of 2 runs, with Anderson picking up the wicket of wicket-keeper Dinesh Ramdin for 70 runs, with an economy of just 2.18, one of his best in Test cricket. With England setting the West Indies a target of 240 runs to win, Anderson had arguably his best innings of the tour. After dismissing opener Lendl Simmons, Anderson bowled 16 overs of reverse swing, picking up two more wickets as again England fell just short of victory, this time by two wickets.\n\nWith the Test series lost, England were keen to regain some honour in the T20 and ODIs which remained. After taking 3 for 48 in 8 overs in a warm-up match against the WIPA President's Select XI, Anderson led the England attack in the T20 international. Despite finishing with decent figures of 1–19 in 3 overs, England were beaten soundly. The first One-Day International, however, saw England inflict their first defeat on the West Indies of the tour. After posting 270 for 7 in their 50 overs, Rain interrupted the West Indies' reply, leading to the result being decided on the Duckworth–Lewis method. With the light fading, Anderson succeeded in having Kieron Pollard caught on the boundary by Steve Harmison. Due to the intricacies of the D/L system, this wicket ensured England won the match by a single run.\n\nIn the next two ODIs, England suffered two more defeats, with Anderson taking 3 for 37 from 9 overs in the second ODI, as well as making 8 with the bat, and went on to take 1 for 39 from 5 overs and 0 not out as England fell 2–1 behind in the five-match series. England therefore needed to win the fourth ODI in Barbados to keep the series alive. Bowling first, England restricted the West Indies to 239/9 in their 50 overs, with Anderson himself taking the wicket of Fidel Edwards to finish with figures of 1 for 41 with 1 maiden in the 10 he bowled. Duckworth-Lewis again helped England as they chased down 136 in 18 overs to win by nine wickets. Thus, the series was tied at 2–2 going into the final match in St. Lucia. The West Indies won the toss and elected to bowl first, with England able to post 172/5 in 29 overs (the innings shortened by rain). With 29 overs to chase 173 for victory, the West Indies lost Gayle to Anderson in the first over with the score at 1/1, Anderson going on to add the wicket of Kieron Pollard as he finished with match figures of 2/34 from 6 overs as England won the match by 26 runs, with Anderson's Lancashire teammate Andrew Flintoff taking a hat-trick.\n\nAnderson finished the tour with 9 wickets at an average of 38.00 from the Test series, with an economy rate of 2.65 runs per over from both innings and best match figures coming in the fifth Test at Trinidad, as well as accumulating 24 runs at an average of 12.00, with a highest-score of 20. In the ODIs, Anderson took 9 wickets at 21.11 and an economy rate of 5.00 runs per over and 8 runs at an equivalent average.\nHe then rejected offers to play in the IPL since he wanted to commit to a bright future for England over the following summer.\n\nThe Wisden Trophy was up for grabs again a few months later when the West Indies replaced Zimbabwe, who were still excluded from participating in Test match cricket by the ICC (although originally the tour had been scheduled to be played by Sri Lanka, who pulled out to allow their players to play in the IPL), in a two-Test and three-ODI tour. Anderson was selected after a bright start to the season with Lancashire, which included figures of 11–109 in a match against Sussex at Hove.\n\nThe first Test was held at Lord's, beginning on 6 May 2020. Anderson was not involved directly until the second day, with England batting first, but made only a single in a 19-ball innings. With the wicket showing a green tinge and some cloud cover, Anderson was expected to excel. However he struggled to find his length bowling in the first innings and finished wicketless from seven overs having conceded 32. An improvement in the second innings saw him take the first two wickets after the follow-on, including that of the West Indies captain Chris Gayle, and finishing with figures of 2–38 from 15 overs and match figures of 2–70 as England won by ten wickets.\n\nFrom Lord's, the teams moved to Chester-le-Street for the second and final Test of the series. England again won the toss and chose to bat, and proceeded to dominate the West Indies bowling attack, amassing 569–6 declared. Anderson was sent in at the end of the first day in his role as night-watchman to protect Pietersen. Batting with Alastair Cook, they made a partnership of 44, Anderson hitting 14 of them to extend his run of innings without a duck in Test cricket. Later on day three, he was given the ball as England set out to take 20 West Indian wickets and secure match victory. Anderson found some significant swing in the cloudy conditions there, and proceeded to skittle through the West Indies top order, taking the first three wickets (including Gayle again) leaving the West Indies on 68/3. Two late strikes secured Anderson a five-wicket haul, his first in 19 innings since his 7-wicket haul against New Zealand at Trent Bridge the previous summer. Anderson went on to take 4 further wickets after the West Indies were asked to follow-on (for the second time in the series) and England went on to win by an innings and 83 runs. With nine wickets in the match for 125 runs, Anderson was named the Man of the Match, only the second time in his career he had achieved this in a Test match.\n\nThe first match of the following ODI series at Headingley was abandoned due to heavy rain, leaving two One-Day matches to be played. Anderson was named in the England squad for the series, and was selected for both matches. In the first match at Bristol, he bowled six overs for nineteen, with one maiden, but finished wicketless as the West Indies were bowled out for 160. England went on to win the match by six wickets, meaning Anderson was not needed to bat. Neither was he required to bat in the last match of the tour as England scored 328/7 from their 50 overs. Although Anderson went at a run a ball in reply, conceding 58 from 9.4 overs, he took three wickets including the last of the match (that of Sulieman Benn) as the West Indies fell 58 runs short, sealing a 2–0 victory for England in both the Test and ODI series.\n\nAnderson went on the tour of South Africa as one of the leaders of the English attack, having established himself in all formats of the game. In the opening T20 International, Anderson failed to pick up a wicket, although he was fairly economical, going at 8 runs an over. Anderson improved in the following match, bowling 4 for 28 runs, picking up a wicket. He was the pick of the English bowlers as South Africa won the match, posting over 200. Anderson bowled well in the ODI series, picking up regular wickets. He claimed 3–60 in the second ODI, and 5–23 in the fourth match. The four-match Test series was drawn 1–1, with Anderson bowling well. He picked up 5 wickets for 63 runs during the 3rd Test, as well as 4–73 in the opening match.\n\nAnderson was selected in the England squad for the 2010 T20 World Cup, despite not being regarded as a specialist in this format of cricket. He did not play in the opening group match against the West Indies. With England playing well in the tournament, and with the three-man seam attack of Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom and Tim Bresnan performing, Anderson could not break into the side. England went on to win the tournament, beating Australia in the final.\n\nEngland faced Bangladesh in a two-match Test series. England were expected to win easily and cruised to victory in the first Test, with Anderson taking figures of 4–78 and 1–84. Anderson also played in the second Test, finishing with figures of 1–45 and 3–16. England won the series 2–0. Anderson played in the first ODI, but was expensive, taking figures of 3–74. He was wicketless in the second game as England suffered a shock defeat. Anderson did not play in the decider, which England won to take the series.\n\nEngland then played Pakistan at home. It was during this series that Anderson established himself as one of the world's best Test bowlers. In the first match he took 5–54 and 6–17 which England won. This left Anderson with match figures of 11–71. He helped England win the second Test, achieving figures of 4–20 in the first innings. Anderson continued to impress in the final two Tests continuing to be economical and providing a wicket-taking threat. Anderson was rested for the first ODI, but returned in the second, taking 1–36 in ten overs. He then took 3–26 in the third match, before playing the remaining matches of the series. Although Anderson struggled to take wickets, his economical bowling frustrated the opposition and kept the run rate down. By the end of the tour, Anderson had established himself as the leader of the England attack, with his swing bowling making him one of the most feared bowlers in the world.\n\nAs expected, Anderson was selected in the England squad to play Australia, where he developed his own wobble-seam delivery to combat the Kookaburra ball that doesn't swing as much for as long. Anderson played well in the opening tour games and took two wickets in the opening Test match, which finished as a draw. In the second Test England thrashed Australia, winning by an innings and 71 runs. Anderson took 4–51 in the first innings and Australia were never able to recover. England lost the third Test, but Anderson still impressed taking 4 wickets. Anderson took 4–44 in the fourth Test, which England won to retain the Ashes. He then took 4–66 and 3–61 as England won the fifth Test and series 3–1. During the series Anderson became the second youngest England bowler to claim 200 Test wickets. Anderson was rested at the start of the ODI series, but with England struggling he was recalled, taking 2–57 in the third match. In the sixth match Anderson took 1–91 of his ten overs as the England team struggled. Anderson took 3–48 in the final match of the series, but it wasn't enough to prevent another defeat as England lost the one-day series 6–1.\n\nAnderson was selected in the squad for the 2011 World Cup and played in the opening game against the Netherlands. He was involved in the dramatic tie against India, where both teams posted 338, and also played as England suffered an embarrassing defeat against Ireland. His best match of the tournament came when he helped England defend 171 against South Africa, where he bowled six overs, collecting figures of 2–16. He was left out of the team against the West Indies, which England won. Anderson did not appear in England's final match against Sri Lanka, in which they lost by ten wickets and so bowed out at the quarter-final stage of the competition. Overall, Anderson had a disappointing tournament, although the pitches did not suit his style of bowling being unable to get the ball to swing.\n\nAnderson was part of the England team when Sri Lanka toured in 2011. Anderson took 3–66 in the first innings, but was unable to bowl in the second due to an injury. England won the first Test after Sri Lanka collapsed for 82 all out in the second innings. Anderson was ruled out of the second Test through injury but returned for the third, taking figures of 2–56 and 2–81 as England drew the match, but won the series 1–0. Anderson took 4–18 in the first ODI but was wicketless in the second match. In the fourth match he returned to his best, taking 3–24. In the final match he took 2–55, helping England to a series win.\n\nEngland's next opponents were India. England needed to win the four match series by two games to overtake India in the world rankings and become the new top-ranked Test team. Anderson shone in the first Test, taking 5–65 as England took a 1–0 lead. Anderson took 5 more wickets in the second Test and a further 6 in the third as England took a 3–0 series lead. Anderson took 3 more wickets in the final Test as England won the series 4–0 and became the new world Number Ones. Following Anderson's performance, he was widely considered the premier fast bowler in the world. Anderson took 3–48 in the third ODI but was left out of the final game of the series as had already won, taking a 2–0 lead into the final match, which they also won by 6 wickets.\n\nEngland toured Pakistan at the back end of 2012. The series was held in the UAE. England struggled in the conditions and slumped to a heavy defeat in the first Test, with Anderson largely ineffectual. England again lost the second Test, with poor performances from the batsmen giving the bowlers little to work with. Anderson took his best figures of the tour, 3–35 in the final match of the series, but it wasn't enough to prevent a whitewash for Pakistan. After the series, England moved on to Sri Lanka for a two-match Test series. Anderson took 5–72 in the first innings but it wasn't enough to prevent a fourth straight defeat for England. Anderson was praised for his performance in conditions which did not favour seam bowlers. England won the final Test to level the series, with Anderson taking figures of 4–98 in the match. As a result of his performances, Anderson was named England Cricketer of the Year.\n\nIn the second Test against West Indies, Anderson took 4–43 at Trent Bridge, a ground where he always performed due to the swing-friendly conditions. With England taking a 2–0 series lead, Anderson was rested for the final match of the series to help him avoid burnout. Anderson played in the ODI series against the West Indies, taking 2–38 in the second match. England then played Australia in 5 ODIs. Anderson took 2–55 in the first match, and 2–34 in the fourth match. There were suggestions that Anderson would play no part in the series, both to rest him and to deprive Australia of facing him ahead of the Ashes series the following year. However, despite this, Anderson played a key part in the series.\n\nEngland faced South Africa at the end of the summer, with their Number One ranking on the line. The series was also anticipated as a chance to see Anderson go head to head with Dale Steyn, regarded as the world's two best seam bowlers. The series was a disappointment for England. They lost the first Test by an innings, with Anderson managing figures of 1–116. The second Test was a tighter affair, with the match ending in a draw, but Anderson could only manage three wickets in the match. England lost the third Test, meaning a 2–0 series defeat, and South Africa earned their place at the top of the Test rankings. Anderson took 4–44 in the third ODI, and 2–41 in the fifth as the series ended as 2–2 draw. This was seen as a positive result for England, with several young players being blooded against an experienced South African team.\n\nFollowing the defeat to South Africa, Andrew Strauss retired and was replaced as captain by Alistair Cook. The first series under the leadership of Cook was against India. England lost the first Test by 9 wickets, with Anderson taking just one wicket in the match. England won the second Test convincingly, but Anderson again struggled in conditions more suited to spinners. Anderson performed much better in the third Test, taking six wickets overall. Anderson took the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar in the 1st innings of the third Test to equal Muttiah Muralitharan as the most successful bowler against Tendulkar with a total of eight dismissals. With England needing just a draw to win the series in the final Test, Anderson took 4–81 to help England draw the match and win the series 2–1.\n\nIn the tour of New Zealand, Anderson returned to the ODI side. In February 2013 during England's loss of the 1st One day international in New Zealand, with the wicket of BJ Watling, his 529th in international cricket, Anderson overtook Ian Botham to become England's all-time highest wicket-taker. He took 5–34 in the second match as England went on to win the series. Anderson took 4–137 in the first Test and went on to take wickets in every innings in the series. The series itself finished 0–0, with the batsmen dominating on good batting wickets.\n\nAnderson played a key role in the 2013 Champions Trophy. He took 3–30 against Australia as England made a winning start to their campaign. During the match ICC Champions Trophy match against Australia he became England's leading ODI wicket-taker when he took his 235th wicket. In the final Group A match he took 3–32 as England reached the semi-finals of the competition. England shocked South Africa and won by 7 wickets, with Anderson taking 2–14 off 8 overs. England played India, the favourites for the competition in the final, in what proved to be a rain interrupted match. Only being able to bowl four overs, Anderson took 1–24, but a poor batting performance meant that England lost the match and India went on to become champions.\n\nIn the opening match of the Test series against New Zealand, Anderson took match figures of 7–70. One the second day of the 1st Test against New Zealand, he became the fourth English bowler to take 300 Test wickets when he dismissed Peter Fulton. England went on to win the series 2–0. Anderson took 3–31 in the first ODI, and also played in the second match. England lost the series 2–1.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, England played Australia in the first of what would be back-to-back Ashes Series. The first Test of the home series was held at Trent Bridge. Despite being favourites, England struggled in the first innings, posting just 215. Anderson led the fightback, taking 5–85 as England bowled Australia out for 280. As Australia closed in on winning the match in the second innings, Anderson took 5–73, including the winning wicket. Anderson was required to bowl a long spell to win England the match, and Kevin Pietersen later posted a picture of Anderson lying exhausted on the floor. England won the second Test, although this time Anderson was less influential, taking only three wickets. Anderson was again quiet in the third Test, in which England managed to hold on to a draw following a long rain delay. Anderson took 2–65 in the fourth Test as England went 3–0 up in the series. Following the game, there was speculation Anderson would be rested for the final Test to ensure he would be fresh for the return series in Australia. However, Anderson played and took 4–95 in the first innings, as the match ended in a draw and England won the series 3–0. Anderson was rested for the ODI series as back up bowlers such as Ben Stokes and Boyd Rankin were given the chance to play.\n\nAnderson again toured Australia as part of the 2013–14 Ashes series. It proved to be a miserable tour for Anderson and the rest of his England teammates. Anderson was ineffectual in the first Test as England lost convincingly. He took 3 wickets in the second Test but it was clear the conditions did not suit his game. In the third Test he bowled 19 wicketless overs and conceded 105 runs as England lost the series. He took 4–67 in the fourth Test but was unable to prevent defeat as the English batsmen continued to struggle. In the fifth Test Australia completed the whitewash, with Anderson taking three wickets in the match. Anderson was rested for the ODI series, which England again struggled in, losing 4–1.\n\nFollowing the Ashes series, England played Sri Lanka at home. In the first match of the series Anderson had figures of 1–22. In the second ODI between England and Sri Lanka, Anderson took two wickets for 38 runs. He finished with figures of 2–10 in the next match as England won by 10 wickets. He took 2–60 in the next match as Sri Lanka levelled the series at 2–2. England lost the final match of the series, with Anderson finishing with figures of 1–33. After picking up figures of 3–93 in the Sri Lankan first innings, he took 4–25 in the second as England fell narrowly short of victory as the first Test ended in a draw. In the second Test, he took 2–49 in the first innings before taking 3–91 in the second. As England battled to save the Test, Anderson faced 55 balls but was dismissed on the penultimate ball of the match as England lost the match. Anderson was named England's man of the series after taking 12 wickets in the series.\n\nOn 12 July 2014, in the First Test of the series against India, Anderson and teammate Joe Root broke numerous records in England's first innings of the first Test against India at Trent Bridge. Anderson hit his maiden first-class fifty as well as posting the highest score (81 runs) by an England No 11 batsman in Test history. His innings was also the longest innings by a No 11 batsman in Test history. Timed at 230 minutes, it surpassed the previous record set by Mushtaq Ahmed in 1997 (183 minutes) by almost an hour. He and Root also set a new world record for a 10th-wicket partnership in Test cricket scoring 198 runs, beating the 163 run-partnership by Australians Phillip Hughes and Ashton Agar at Trent Bridge on 11 July 2013. Anderson and fellow bowler Stuart Broad were criticised for their performance in the second Test after failing to capitalise on a good bowling surface. Anderson finished with match figures of 5–137 as England lost the match, increasing the pressure on the team. He returned to his best in the next Test as England levelled the series as he took figures of 5–53 in the first innings and 2–24 in the second. His first-innings spell was nominated to be one of the best Test bowling performance of the year 2014 by ESPNCricinfo.\nIn the fourth match of the series he took match figures of 5–64 as England won the match by an innings to go 2–1 up in the series. Anderson was again pivotal as England won the final match of the series, taking four wickets in the match. After the conclusion of the 5th Test, Anderson was named Man of the Series for taking 25 wickets. Anderson had a mixed ODI series against India. After the first match was abandoned, Anderson was wicket less in the first three games of the series, taking figures of 0–57, 0–29 and 0–38 as England went 3–0 down in the series. However, he bowled well in the final match of the series, taking figures of 2–39 as England won the match.\n\nFollowing injury, Anderson returned to the England team for the second match of the Tri-Series against India, where he had figures of 4–18 to help England win. In the next match against Australia he was wicket less as England were defeated. In the game against India, Anderson picked up figures of 1–24 to help England qualify for the final. In the final, Anderson picked up two wickets but England lost the match and finished runners-up.\n\nAnderson failed to take a wicket in the first match against Australia, finishing with figures of 0–67. In the next match against New Zealand he finished with figures of 0–37 as England suffered a humiliating eight wicket defeat. He took his first wickets of the tournament against Scotland as he collected figures of 2–30 as England won their first game of the tournament. He was again wicket less in England's defeat to Sri Lanka. In their must win game against Bangladesh, Anderson took figures of 2–45 but was later the last man out as England lost the game to exit the World Cup. In their final group game against Afghanistan, Anderson bowled economically, finishing with figures of 1–18 as England won their final match of the tournament.\n\nIn April 2015, during the drawn first Test of the West Indies tour in Antigua (Anderson's 100th match), he had West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin caught at slip for his 384th Test wicket, thus overtaking another Ian Botham record and becoming England's all-time highest Test match wicket-taker. Despite Anderson's best efforts, the match ended in a draw. In the second Test Anderson took 2–47 West Indies first innings as they were bowled out for 299. His figures of 4–43 in the second innings helped England put themselves in a match winning position. They won the game by nine wickets to go 1–0 up in the series. In the final Test, Anderson took 6–42 in the West Indies first innings as England took a first innings lead. However, England collapsed in their second innings and although Anderson took a wicket in the West Indies second innings, it wasn't enough to prevent a five wicket defeat as the series ended in a 1–1 draw. He was awarded with the player of the series award.\n\nNew Zealand toured England for a 2 test and 5 ODI series. Anderson took 1–88 in New Zealand's first innings in the first Test between the two sides. In the second innings he took 1–31 as England won the match by 124 runs to go 1–0 up in the series. In the second Test he took 2–43 as New Zealand were bowled out for 350. He made an unbeaten ten with the bat to help England reach 350 and level the scores. In New Zealand's second innings he took 2–96 as New Zealand won the Test to level the series at 1–1. During the series Anderson took his 400th Test wicket and scored his 1000th Test run.\n\nIn the first Test Anderson took figures of 3–43 in Australia's first innings to help restrict them to 308, and England went on to win the game by 169 runs. In the second Test he failed to take a wicket in the whole match, finishing with figures of 0–99 in the first innings and 0–48 in the second innings as Australia won the match by 405 runs. In the third Test, Anderson took 6–47 in the Australian first innings to help restrict them to 136. He took 1–15 in the second innings but injured himself in the process. Although England won the game to go 2–1 up in the series, Anderson was ruled out of the remainder of the series through injury. England went on to win the series 3–2.\n\nAnderson recovered from his injury in time for the Test series against Pakistan. In the first innings of the first Test, Anderson took figures of 2–42 and bowled economically as Pakistan were dismissed for 523. In the second innings he took figures of 2–30 as Pakistan were bowled out for 173, but England did not have enough time to force a win and the match finished in a draw. In the second Test Anderson took 1–40 in the first innings, before finishing with figures of 2–22 in Pakistan's second innings as they were dismissed for 354. However, England's batting was unable to chase down the target and the suffered a 127 run defeat. England needed to win the final Test of the series to level it, and Pakistan were dismissed cheaply for 234 in the first innings, with Anderson taking 4–17. However, they recovered in their second innings, scoring 355, despite Anderson taking 2–52. An England second innings collapse saw Pakistan win the series 2–0.\n\nAnderson was injured for the first Test against South Africa. He returned to the side for the second Test but failed to make an impact, taking 1–77 as the match ended in a draw. In the third Test Anderson took 1–60 in South Africa's first innings, before taking 1–26 in their second innings as they collapsed to 83 all out to hand England a historic victory on South Africa soil. Anderson took his best figures of the series in the final Test, finishing with 3–47 in South Africa's second innings, but a poor batting performance from England saw South Africa win the Test by 280 run, although England won the series 2–1.\n\nIn the first Test against Sri Lanka, Anderson was in sublime form, taking figures of 5–16 in the tourist's first innings to restrict them to 91. In their second innings, he took figures of 5–29 as England secured a comprehensive victory by a margin of an innings and 88 runs. In the second Test, Anderson took 3–36 in Sri Lanka's first innings, and followed this up with 5–58 in their second innings as England secured another win, this time by nine wickets. In the final, rain affected match of the series, Anderson took figures of 2–61 in Sri Lanka's first innings, and then took the only wicket to fall in Sri Lanka's second innings as the match ended in a draw. Following his exploits, Anderson ended the series as the World's Number One Test bowler.\n\nAfter missing the first Test through injury, Anderson returned in the second match of the series and took four wickets in the match as England won to level the series at 1–1. In the third match, he took figures of 2–54 in Pakistan's first innings and then took 2–31 in their second innings as England recorded a 141 run victory. England lost the final match of the series, with Anderson taking just one wicket in the match as the series finished 2–2.\n\nAfter missing the series against Bangladesh through injury, Anderson returned to the side for the second Test against India. He took 3–62 in the first innings as India made 455. He then took 1–33 in the second innings. India won the match by 246 runs. In the third Test he did not take a wicket in India's first innings, and with India needing a small target to win the game in the second innings, Anderson again failed to take a wicket as India won by eight wickets. In the fourth Test he took 0–63 as India posted 631 and won the game by an innings and 36 runs. Anderson missed the final Test through injury, with England losing the series 4–0.\n\nAnderson was named as England Test vice-captain after Ben Stokes was suspended indefinitely. Stokes was arrested in the early hours of the morning following the third ODI against West Indies at Bristol in September 2017 from an incident near a night club, at which teammate Alex Hales was also present. \n\nMidway through the Ashes tour England Lions batsman Ben Duckett was suspended after pouring a drink over Anderson in a Perth bar. Although coach Trevor Bayliss described the incident as trivial, coming as it did after the Stokes affair and a head-butting incident between Cameron Bancroft and Jonny Bairstow, it seemed to confirm that England had off-field issues during the 2017–18 Ashes.\n\nAnderson played all five Test matches in the Ashes but couldn't prevent his team losing control of the urn, with England slipping to a 4–0 series defeat. Despite the poor performance of the team as a whole, Anderson emerged with some considerable personal credit having returned figures of 17 wickets at an average of 27.82 over the Test series, including a haul of 5/43 in the 2nd innings of the day-night 2nd Test at Adelaide. He ended the tour as the top England wicket-taker in the Ashes. Over the entire series Anderson bowled 223.3 overs, the most in a series in his career.\n\nDuring the second Test against New Zealand in 2018, Anderson – along with partner Stuart Broad and the two opening bowlers from the opposition (Trent Boult and Tim Southee) – was part of just the third quartet of opening bowlers to take all 20 wickets in the first innings of each team in a single Test match (and the first since 1912). In the same Test series, Anderson set another milestone by becoming the most heavily-used fast bowler ever in Test history, surpassing Courtney Walsh's record of 30,019 deliveries in a Test career. He was the second highest wicket-taker in the 2 match Test series, taking 8 wickets with England eventually losing the series 1–0.\n\nAnderson was selected in the England squad to face Pakistan in May 2018 in a two Test match series. In the first Test match, which Pakistan won, Anderson had team leading match figures of 4–94. In the second Test he took 5 wickets at the expense of 78 runs, to help England win by an innings and 55 runs. Overall Anderson took a team leading 9 wickets during the series, with the series being tied 1–1.\n\nAnderson was in the side as England played their 1,000th Test match, during the first Test against India at Edgbaston in the five-match series. During the second Test, Anderson picked up his 100th wicket at Lord's in Tests, and his 550th Test match wicket as he took 5–20 in the first innings, and finished with match figures of 9–43. The third Test at Trent Bridge was won by India as they recovered from a 2–0 start to the series, Anderson took his 100th wicket against India in Tests. In the fifth Test, Anderson equalled Glenn McGrath's record for the most Test wickets by a pace bowler (563), he then surpassed this later in the game when he took his 564th Test wicket. Anderson took 24 wickets at an average of 18.13 during the series, the most wickets by any bowler during the series as England beat India 4–1.\n\nAnderson played the first two Tests of the three-match series in Sri Lanka. In the first Test, he took match figures of 1/53 from 22 overs, helping England to their first ever Test win in Galle. The second Test saw a record breaking 38 wickets taken by spin bowlers, with Anderson going wicketless for the first time in almost two years. Anderson was rested for the third Test, to allow Stuart Broad match practice. This meant Anderson finished with just 1 wicket in the series, the lowest in a Test series he had participated in since 2003.\n\nAnderson took a five-wicket haul during the first innings of the three-match Test series against the West Indies at Kensington Oval, Barbados. This was his 27th five-wicket haul, tying Ian Botham's record for England in Test matches. Whilst en route to his five-wicket haul, he also became the first English bowler to take 200 Test wickets away from home. Despite this, England lost the match by 381 runs, the West Indies' largest victory in terms of runs at home. Anderson finished the series, which England lost 2–1, with 10 wickets at an average of 24.50.\n\nOn 29 May 2020, Anderson was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nOn 8 December 2011 He was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Burnley.\nIn the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours, Anderson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \"for services to cricket\".

This gave the channel a content boost with several Swedish films. It also made TV1000 more able to compete with FilmNet which was the leading premium channel at the time.\n\nThe merger took place on 1 September 1991. The name of the merged channel was initially announced to be \"TV1000 Succékanalen\", but that never caught on.\n\nAs TV1000 was much larger than SF Succé, Kinnevik would own 75 percent of the new channel, while SF Succé's owners only owned 25 percent. When Kinnevik spun off their media division into the Modern Times Group in 1997, TV1000 wasn't included. Kinnevik were eventually able to buy out the rest of the owners, and TV1000 became a part of MTG in 2000.\n\nIn February 1995 a sister channel called TV1000 Cinema, or just \"Cinema\", launched. Cable distributors were initially hesitant to offer the new channel, which led MTG to close down another channel called FilmMax in November 1995 and trying to replace it with Cinema.\n\nOn 15 April 2000, when Viasat launched its digital platform, TV1000 and Cinema got two time-shift channels, each broadcasting the content with one- and two-hour delays.\nOn 1 September 2004 TV1000 had a major overhaul. Cinema and three of the time-shift channels closed down and were replaced by four themed movie channels. The line-up would then be TV1000, TV1000 Plus One (one hour time-shift of TV1000), TV1000 Family, TV1000 Action, TV1000 Nordic and TV1000 Classic.\n\nIn early 2008 TV1000 launched its first high-definition channel. It was called TV1000 HD and is a simulcast of the main TV1000 channel for the Nordic countries.\n\nOn 16 February 2009 an eighth TV1000 channel, TV1000 Drama, is launched in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. At the same time, the other TV1000 channels had their logos replaced by a new design.\n\nThe one-hour timeshift of the main TV1000 channel TV1000 Plus One was closed down on 1 August 2010.\n\nOn 2 January 2012 it was announced that the TV1000 channels will be rebranded as Viasat Film starting from 3 March 2012 in the Nordic region. TV1000 is still available in Central Europe as TV1000 East.\n\nOn April 23, 2014 changed Viasat in their lineup of movie channels, Viasat Film Nordic closed and was replaced by Viasat Film Comedy. The Nordic film will in future be included in the program on the other channels and Viasat Film Action and Viasat Film Classic was reduced transmission time and put forward only in the evening hours while closed to Viasat Film Drama HD. and Viasat Film Action HD began to simulcast with Nat Geo Wild HD in daytime on the Viasat satellite platform.\n\n10 November 2015 changed Viasat back in their lineup of movie channels, Viasat Film Classic and Viasat Film Drama was closed down and replaced by Viasat Film Hits (Which will send new and classic film favorites) and Viasat Series (a pure serial channel with both new and classic series), also was changed during the program on other channels, it returned to again show series and children's programs as they did in the 90s under the brand TV1000, Viasat Film Family withdrawn children's programs from Disney Jr. daytime and Viasat Film Comedy began broadcasting classic comedy series in the daytime, also changed Viasat Film name to Viasat Film Premiere.\n\nIn 2018 the TV department of MTG was split off into Nordic Entertainment Group.\n\nTV1000 was previously transmitted using D2-MAC and encrypted with the EuroCrypt encryption system. It was available originally via the Astra 1A satellite, and later via the Intelsat 707 satellite (where TV1000 Cinema was also available via the co-located TV-Sat2 satellite). Today, the Scandinavian version of Viasat Film is transmitted digitally and encrypted in the VideoGuard system (after previously using the Viaccess system that was widely hacked) within the Viasat package on the Astra 4A satellite.\n\nIn March 2003, TV1000 East began broadcasting in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. A channel broadcasting only Russian movies called TV1000 Russkoe Kino (\"ТВ1000 Русское Кино\") was launched in October 2005. \nIn April 2008 was launched TV1000 Premium. On 1 September 2008 TV1000 Action East was launched.\n\nTV1000 Balkan was launched on 18 November 2005 in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro.

It is located on the dividing line between Mexico State and the eastern edge of the Federal District and is part of the Greater Mexico City area. The area was part of a region called \"Atlicpac\" which in Náhuatl means 'above or at the edge of water.' The current city's/municipality's glyph symbolizes water.\n\nThis area was the land of the Acolhuas whose capital was in Texcoco. As such they were part of the heart of the Aztec Triple Alliance and the Aztec Empire, on the receiving end of tribute coming in from other parts of the empire. This continued until the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. During the colonial period, more specifically in the 18th century, this area was in constant territorial conflict. This ended up with the consolidation of a number of communities into two entities called \"San Salvador Tecamachalco\" and \"La Magdalena Atlicpac\" around 1770-1773, now the neighborhoods of Atenantitlan and Tejolote. In 1882, the first railroad connecting the area and Mexico City was built, beginning Los Reyes' close economic ties with the metropolis even though the original town itself would not join the municipality until 1889. Los Reyes achieved city status in 1977. There is a tire burning festival held on the last Friday of every month. The tire that emits the most smoke wins. The current champion is Jesus Garcia from the surrounding municipality. Opponents of global warming criticize this traditional festival as destructive to the environment.\n\nThe municipality was founded in 1875 by President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, furthering a process of consolidation of the area that had begun in the prior century. The towns of La Magdalena Atlicpac, San Sebastián Chimalpa and Tecamachalco were unified under the control of La Magdalena Atlicpac. Only later would Los Reyes become the seat.\n\nThe municipality covers a total surface area of and, in the year 2010 census, reported a population of 253,845. It borders with Chicoloapan, Chimalhuacán, Ixtapaluca, Valle de Chalco Solidaridad, Nezahualcoyotl and the Distrito Federal, specifically with the borough of Iztapalapa\n\nThe municipality consists of 18 localities (15 urban and 3 rural), of which its municipal seat, Los Reyes Acaquilpan, also known as Los Reyes La Paz, which had a 2010 census population of 85,359 inhabitants, is the largest. Line A of the Mexico City Metro terminates in Los Reyes at the station called Metro La Paz.\n\nLocalities (cities, towns, and villages) are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1944613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944613", "title": "Chondromalacia patellae", "text": "Chondromalacia patellae\n\nChondromalacia patellae (also known as CMP) is an inflammation of the underside of the patella and softening of the cartilage.\n\nThe cartilage under the kneecap is a natural shock absorber, and overuse, injury, and many other factors can cause increased deterioration and breakdown of the cartilage. The cartilage is no longer smooth and therefore movement and use is very painful. While it often affects young individuals engaged in active sports, it also afflicts older adults who overwork their knees.\n\n\"Chondromalacia patellae\" is sometimes used synonymously with patellofemoral pain syndrome. However, there is general consensus that \"patellofemoral pain syndrome\" applies only to individuals without cartilage damage.\n\nThe condition may result from acute injury to the patella or chronic friction between the patella and a groove in the femur through which it passes during knee flexion. Possible causes include a tight iliotibial band, neuromas, bursitis, overuse, malalignment, core instability, and patellar maltracking.\n\nPain at the front or inner side of the knee is common in adults of all ages especially when engaging in soccer, gymnastics, cycling, rowing, tennis, ballet, basketball, horseback riding, volleyball, running, combat sports, figure skating, snowboarding, skateboarding and even swimming. The pain is typically felt after prolonged sitting. Skateboarders most commonly experience this injury in their non-dominant foot due to the constant kicking and twisting required of it. Swimmers acquire it doing the breaststroke, which demands an unusual motion of the knee. People who are involved in an active life style with high impact on the knees are at greatest risk. Proper management of physical activity may help prevent worsening of the condition. Athletes are advised to talk to a physician for further medical diagnosis as symptoms may be similar to more serious problems within the knee. Tests are not necessarily needed for diagnosis, but in some situations it may confirm diagnosis or rule out other causes for pain. Commonly used tests are blood tests, MRI scans, and arthroscopy.\n\nWhile the term \"chondromalacia\" sometimes refers to abnormal-appearing cartilage anywhere in the body, it most commonly denotes irritation of the underside of the kneecap (or \"patella\"). The patella's posterior surface is covered with a layer of smooth cartilage, which the base of the femur normally glides smoothly against when the knee is bent. However, in some individuals the kneecap tends to rub against one side of the knee joint, irritating the cartilage and causing knee pain.\n\nIn the absence of cartilage damage, pain at the front of the knee due to overuse can be managed with a combination of RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), anti-inflammatory medications, and physiotherapy.\n\nUsually chondromalacia develops without swelling or bruising and most individuals benefit from rest and adherence to an appropriate physical therapy program. Allowing inflammation to subside while avoiding irritating activities for several weeks is followed by a gradual resumption. Cross-training activities such as swimming – using strokes other than the breaststroke – can help to maintain general fitness and body composition. This is beneficial until a physical therapy program emphasizing strengthening and flexibility of the hip and thigh muscles can be undertaken. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is also helpful to minimize the swelling amplifying patellar pain. Treatment with surgery is declining in popularity due to positive non-surgical outcomes and the relative ineffectiveness of surgical intervention.\n\n"}
