A firm Calvinist, he was a leader of mercenary troops in the religious wars of the time, including the Dutch Revolt. From 1583–1592 he acted as regent for his nephew, Elector Palatine Frederick IV.\n\nCount Palatine John Casimir was born in Simmern as the third son of Frederick III, Elector Palatine, and Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, of the Simmern middle electoral line of the House of Wittelsbach. In 1564 John Casimir suggested himself as a bridegroom for Elizabeth I of England and sent her his portrait via the Scottish courtier Sir James Melville. Elizabeth, however, showed no interest in him.\n\nOn 26 November 1568 he was engaged to the 16-year-old Lutheran Elisabeth of Saxony, a daughter of Augustus, Elector of Saxony and his first wife Anne of Denmark. The wedding took place in Heidelberg on June 6, 1570. The marriage was political, as John Casimir wanted to link Calvinism to Saxony through the marriage. Their marriage turned out to be unhappy, and not only because of religious differences. John Casimir ordered his wife under house arrest accusing her of adultery. Elisabeth gave birth to six children, three of whom were stillborn; the other three were daughters. She died in prison on April 2, 1590.\n\nFrom March, 1571 Johann Casimir resided in Kaiserslautern for a decade. When his father died in 1576, he ordered in his will that the Palatinate was to remain Calvinist. His son, Louis VI, inherited the main part of the Palatinate, including Heidelberg, and John Casimir inherited a smaller portion, which became the independent Count Palatine of Lautern (essentially consisting of the city of Kaiserslautern and surrounding area). John Casimir's brother Ludwig, who had been secretly raised by his mother as a Lutheran, did not honor his father's wish and instead supported Lutheranism. Many professors of theology, including Zacharias Ursinus, left the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg and were welcomed to Lautern by Johann Casimir who built the Collegium Casimirianum in Neustadt as a substitute university for them in 1578.\n\nJohn Casimir was in regular contact with Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and his nephew Sir Philip Sidney who, as agent for Elizabeth I, was sent to the continent to assist in the formation of a Protestant league. In 1576, John Casimir entered France leading four thousand troops. As a result of this campaign, he was made \"duc d’Étampes\" by Henry III of France for a few months, in 1576–1577. This was a theoretical position, as he never actually visited his French duchy. He visited England in 1579 to seek the Queen's financial support for his campaigns on behalf of the United Provinces. In February 1579 the Earl of Leicester took him to Oxford and he was entertained for three weeks at the English court. From 1583 to 1592 Casimir acted as regent for his nephew Elector Frederick IV.\n\nWith Elisabeth of Saxony:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2141062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141062", "title": "Traffic camera", "text": "Traffic camera\n\nA traffic camera is a video camera which observes vehicular traffic on a road. Typically, these are put along major roads such as highways, freeways, motorways, autoroutes and expressways, as well as arterial roads, and are connected with optical fibers buried alongside or even under the road, with electrical power either provided by mains power in urban areas, or via solar panels or another alternate power source which provides consistent imagery without the threat of a power outage during inclement conditions.\n\nA monitoring center receives the live video in real time, and serves as a dispatcher if there is a traffic collision or some other disruptive incident or road safety issue.\n\nTraffic cameras are a major part of most intelligent transportation systems. They are especially valuable in tunnels, where safety equipment can be activated remotely based upon information provided by the cameras and other sensors. On surface roads, they are typically mounted on high poles or masts, sometimes along with street lights. On arterial roads, they are often mounted on traffic light poles at intersections, where problems are most likely to occur. In remote areas without easy reach of the main electrical grid, they are usually powered by another means such as solar power, which also provides a backup source to urban camera infrastructure.\n\nTraffic cameras are distinct from road safety cameras, which are put in specific places to enforce rules of the road. Those cameras take still photos in a much higher image resolution upon a trigger, whereas traffic cameras are simply for observation and constantly take lower-resolution video, often in full motion, though they are remotely controllable in order to focus on an ongoing traffic incident farther along a road that may not be in the camera's usual field of view or even along a frontage road or other roadway within its field of vision. Many transmit in the legacy analog NTSC and PAL formats, depending on location, though many are being converted to high definition video as equipment is replaced. Some have a compass built in which displays the cardinal direction at which the camera is aimed, though many providers also provide a reference image of a shot with the cardinal direction.\n\nMany transportation departments have linked their camera networks to the Internet on online websites, thus making them webcams which allow commuters to view current traffic conditions. They may show either streaming video or still imagery which refreshes at a set interval of seconds or minutes, helping travelers determine whether an alternate route should be taken. In the United States and Canada, these often are displayed on state or municipally-run 5-1-1 websites (511 being a telephone number designed to relay current traffic information). These traffic images are also combined with road sensors which measure traffic timing to provide a full picture of traffic conditions. \n\nMany states and provinces consider this information public domain, thus many television stations air live traffic camera imagery during their own traffic reports on their local news broadcasts, or simply as an augmenting moving visual background during newscasts. Some cable TV systems provide these pictures full-time on a governmental access channel, and some broadcast stations set aside a full digital subchannel solely for traffic information and camera imagery, such as Philadelphia's WPHL-DT4 in the past and WMVT-DT3 in Milwaukee and WFMZ-DT2 in Allentown, Pennsylvania currently. However, in some cases for toll roads and other private road authorities, such as the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, these images are claimed to be the property of the toll agency (or private company which runs a toll road), and the images are held under an exclusivity agreement for one station (in the ISTHA's case, they only air on WMAQ-TV).\n\n"}
{"id": "2141084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141084", "title": "Bilal ibn Rabah", "text": "Bilal ibn Rabah\n\nBilal ibn Rabah (, \"Bilāl ibn Rabāḥ\" , 580–640 AD) was one of the most trusted and loyal \"Sahabah\" (companions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was born in Mecca and is considered to have been the first mu'azzin, chosen by Muhammad himself. He was a former slave. Bilal ibn Rabah was known for his beautiful voice with which he called people to their prayers. He died in 640, at the age of 57.\n\nBilal ibn Rabah was born in Mecca in the Hejaz in the year 580 . His father Rabah was an Arab slave for the clan of Banu Jumah while his mother, Hamamah, was a former princess of Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia) who was captured after the event of Amul-Fill (the attempt to destroy the Ka'aba) and put into slavery. Before that tragedy occurred, Bilal was living a calm life alongside his mother and young sister. Being born into slavery, Bilal had no other option but to work for his master, Umayyah ibn Khalaf. Through hard work, Bilal became recognised as a good slave and was entrusted with the keys to the Idols of Arabia. However, racism and sociopolitical statutes of Arabia prevented Bilal from achieving a lofty position in society.\n\nIn his book, \"Bilal ibn Rabah\", Muhammad Abdul-Rauf states that Bilal \"was of a handsome and impressive stature, dark brown complexion with sparkling eyes, a fine nose and bright skin. He was also gifted with a deep, melodious, resonant voice. He wore a beard which was thin on both cheeks. He was endowed with great wisdom and a sense of dignity and self esteem.\"\nSimilarly, in his book \"The Life of Muhammad\", William Muir states that Bilal \"was tall, dark, and with African feature and bushy hair.\"\nMuir also states that noble members of the Quraysh despised Bilal and called him \"Ibn Sawda\" (son of the black woman).\n\nWhen Muhammad announced his prophethood and started to preach the message of Islam, Bilal renounced idol worship, becoming one of the earliest converts to the faith.\n\nWhen Bilal's slave master, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, found out, he began to torture Bilal. At the instigation of Abu Jahl, Umayyah bound Bilal and had him dragged around Mecca as children mocked him. Bilal refused to renounce Islam, instead repeating \"Ahad Ahad\" (God is absolute/one). Incensed at Bilal's refusal, Umayyah ordered that Bilal be whipped and beaten while spread-eagled upon the Arabian sands under the desert sun, his limbs bound to stakes. When Bilal still refused to recant, Umayyah ordered that a hot boulder be placed on Bilal's chest. However, Bilal remained firm in belief and continued to say \"Ahad Ahad\". News of this slave reached some of Muhammad's companions, who informed the prophet. Muhammad sent Abu Bakr to negotiate for the emancipation of Bilal, who manumitted him after either purchasing him or exchanging him for a non-Muslim slave.\n\nBilal rose to prominence in the Islamic community of Medina, as Muhammad appointed him minister of the Bayt al-Mal (treasury). In this capacity, Bilal distributed funds to widows, orphans, wayfarers, and others who could not support themselves.\n\nMuhammad chose Bilal as the first mu'azzin (reciter of the Adhan).\n\nSunnis believed that Muhammad specifically chose Bilal to become the Mu'azzin (caller to prayer) of Islam. It was believed that he chose him due to his beautifully unique voice. He personally taught Bilal how to call the Muslims to prayer. However, other Sunni traditions suggest that a companion suggested to Muhammad that they should blow a trumpet or ring a bell in order to alert the Muslims before the time of each prayer. According to the Sunni traditions Muhammad did not accept this suggestion because he did not want to adopt the Jewish or Christian customs. One day, Abdullah ibn Ziyad, a citizen of Yathrib (Medina), came to see Muhammad. Abdullah ibn Ziyad explained to him that while he was half-awake or half-asleep, a man appeared before him in his dream and told him that the human voice ought to be used to call the Muslims to prayer. In addition, the man also taught Abdullah the Adhan along with the manner of saying it. The Sunni historians state that Muhammad was pleased with the idea and adopted it. After adopting the Adhan, Muhammad called Bilal and taught the Adhan to him.\n\nShias, on the other hand, do not accept Abdullah ibn Ziyad's story. They state that the Adhan was revealed to Muhammad just as the Qur'an al-Majid was revealed to him. Shias believe that the Adhan could not be left to the dreams or reveries. Furthermore, Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy states, \"If the Prophet could teach the Muslims how to perform prostrations, and how, when, and what to say in each prayer, he could also teach them how and when to alert others before the time for each prayer.\"\nAccording to the Shia traditions, the angel who taught Muhammad how to perform ablutions preparatory to prayers and how to perform prayers also taught him the Adhan.\n\nHe participated in the Battle of Badr. Muhammad's forces included Ali ibn Abi Talib, Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Ammar ibn Yasir, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Abu Bakr, Umar, Mus`ab ibn `Umair, and Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, The Muslims also brought seventy camels and two horses, meaning that they either had to walk or fit three to four men per camel. However, many early Muslim sources indicate that no serious fighting was expected, and the future Caliph Uthman stayed behind to care for his sick wife Ruqayyah, the daughter of Muhammad. Salman the Persian also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man.\n\nIn the Sīrat Abī Bakr Al-Ṣiddīq that compiled many narrations and compiled historical circumstances regarding the rule of Caliph Abu Bakr, Bilal accompanied the Muslim armies, under the commands of Said ibn Aamir al-Jumahi, to Syria.\n\nAfter Muhammad died in 632 AD, Bilal was one of the people who did not give bay'ah (the oath of allegiance) to Abu Bakr. It is documented that when Bilal did not give bay'ah to Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab grabbed Bilal by his clothes and asked, \"Is this the reward of Abu Bakr; he emancipated you and you are now refusing to pay allegiance to him?\nBilal replied, \"If Abu Bakr had emancipated me for the pleasure of Allah, then let him leave me alone for Allah; and if he had emancipated me for his service, then I am ready to render him the services required. But I am not going to pay allegiance to a person whom the Messenger of God had not appointed as his caliph.\" Similarly, al-Isti'ab, a Sunni source, states that Bilal told Abu Bakr: \"If you have emancipated me for yourself, then make me a captive again; but if you had emancipated me for Allah, then let me go in the way of Allah.\"\nThis was said when Bilal wanted to go for Jihad. Abu Bakr then let him go.\"\nThe following is a poem by Bilal on his refusal to give Abu Bakr bay'ah:\nBeing exiled from Medina by Umar and Abu Bakr, Bilal migrated to Syria.\n\nAbu Ja'far al-Tusi, a Shia scholar, has also stated in \"lkhtiyar al-Rijal\" that Bilal refused to pay allegiance to Abu Bakr.\n\nPurnam Allahabadi, a Sufi poet whose works originated from the Mughal Empire, composed a Qawwali in which he mentioned how time had stopped when some companions blocked Bilal from delivering the Adhan (which he had seen in his dream), and appealed that it was incorrect. Because the companion Bilal was of an Abyssinian origin, he could not pronounce the letter \"Sh\" (Arabic: \"Shin\" ش ). A hadith of Muhammad reports that he said, \"The 'seen' of Bilal is 'sheen' in the hearing of Allah,\" meaning God does not look at the external but appreciates the purity of heart.\n\nThe Sunni scholar al-Suyuti in his \"Tarikh al-khulafa\" wrote: \"He (Bilal) died in Damascus in 17 or 18 AH, but some say 20 AH, or even 21 AH when he was just over sixty years old. Some said he died in Medina, but that is wrong. That is how it is in al-Isabah and other works such as the Tahdhib of an-Nawawi.\"\n\nWhen Bilal's wife realized that death was approaching Bilal, she became sorrowful. It is documented that she cried and said, \"What a painful affliction!\" However, Bilal objected his wife's opinion by stating, \"On the contrary, what a happy occasion! Tomorrow I will meet my beloved Muhammad and his faction (hizb)!\"\n\nThe descendants of Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi are said to have migrated to the land of Ethiopia in East Africa. The Imperial family of Mali in West Africa also claims descent from him.\n\nThough there are some disagreements concerning the hard facts of Bilal's life and death, his importance on a number of levels is incontestable. Mu'azzins, especially those in Turkey and Africa, have traditionally venerated the original practitioner of their profession. The story of Bilal is the most frequently cited demonstration of Islam's views of measure people not by their nationality nor social status nor race, but measuring people by their Taqwah (piety). \n\nIn 1874, Edward Wilmot Blyden, a former slave of African descent, wrote: \"The eloquent Adzan or Call to Prayer, which to this day summons at the same hours millions of the human race to their devotions, was first uttered by a Negro, Bilal by name, whom Mohammed, in obedience to a dream, appointed the first Mu'azzin. And it has been remarked that even Alexander the Great is in Asia an unknown personage by the side of this honoured Negro.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He made his MLB debut in 2004. While pitching for the Phillies, he was a member of the 2008 World Series champions. Blanton continued to pitch in MLB through 2013, when he retired in 2014. Blanton returned from retirement to pitch in MLB from 2015 through 2017.\n\nJoe Blanton was born in Nashville, Tennessee, but grew up in Chalybeate, Kentucky. He graduated from Franklin-Simpson High School in 1999. He attended the University of Kentucky and played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats, with a 13–12 record from 2000 to 2002, and led the Southeastern Conference with 133 strikeouts in his final season, finishing with a 4.59 earned run average (ERA). In 2001 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics selected Blanton in the first round, with the 24th overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft, This draft was chronicled by Michael Lewis in his book, \"Moneyball\". In 2003, while pitching for the Kane County Cougars and the Midland RockHounds, Blanton ranked second in all of Minor League Baseball with a combined 174 strikeouts. The next season, he helped the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats win the Pacific Coast League Championship with an 11–8 record and a 4.19 ERA. He struck out 143 batters in 176 innings, tossing one complete game in 26 starts.\n\nBlanton made his major league debut on September 21, 2004, against the Texas Rangers. He made three appearances and pitched eight innings. He posted a 5.63 ERA, but did not get a decision in any of his games.\nIn 2005, Blanton joined the starting rotation that had lost pitchers Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson to trades. He made his first start on April 8 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, pitching five innings and allowing two runs. After losing his first five decisions, he picked up his first win when he worked seven innings against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 4. Blanton was third on the team in innings pitched, but still exceeded 200 innings in his first full season. He posted a 12–12 record with a 3.53 ERA in 33 starts, and his 33 starts set an Oakland rookie record for most games started which had broken the previous mark of 32 set by Matt Keough in 1978. His ERA was best among all rookies with 100 or more innings pitched. He also tied the Oakland rookie record for most wins in a season with 12. His first career complete game came as a 1–0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on April 24, 2005; he was the only rookie to post two complete games in 2005. Blanton's high loss total was attributed to poor run support, as the A's only posted six runs total in all twelve of his losses combined, while posting 62 runs in his 12 wins. Blanton was also named the American League Rookie of the Month for June, as he tied with teammate Dan Haren for the AL lead in wins and finished third in ERA in June.\n\nIn 2006, Blanton's ERA rose over a full point to 4.82 and gave up the fifth highest number of hits in the American League (241), resulting in a .309 batting average against. However, he had four more wins than the previous year, posting a 16–12 record, striking out 107 batters and walking 58. He pitched his first career complete game shutout against the Kansas City Royals on May 31. Blanton did not pitch in the ALDS for the Athletics, but was named to the roster for the ALCS, where he pitched two innings in one appearance, allowing no hits or runs.\n\nBlanton had a 14–10 record in 230 innings pitched in 2007. He struck out 140 batters, walked 40, and gave up 101 earned runs, resulting in a 3.95 ERA for the year. Though Blanton's road and home records were the same (7–5), his home ERA was 2.69 compared with 5.11 on the road. He also pitched three complete games in 2007, but his first one of the season was his third career complete-game loss, on April 25. Blanton made his 100th career appearance at the end of the season, a 7–3 win against the Texas Rangers on September 15. \nThe A's traded Blanton, who had a 5–12 record and a 4.96 ERA to the Philadelphia Phillies for second baseman Adrian Cárdenas, pitcher Josh Outman, and outfielder Matthew Spencer on July 17, 2008.\n\nIn Blanton's first start for the Phillies, he pitched six innings and allowed five runs; however, he did not factor in the decision as the Phillies scored six runs off the New York Mets' bullpen in the ninth inning to win. On August 2, Blanton recorded his first win as a Phillie against the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 2–1 in his third Phillies start. For the season, 51% of his strikeouts were \"looking\", the highest percentage in the majors.\n\nIn Game 4 of the 2008 World Series, Blanton hit his first major league home run to become the 13th pitcher overall and first since Ken Holtzman in 1974 to hit a home run in a World Series game. He was also credited with the win in the Phillies' Game 4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching six innings and allowing two runs on four hits. On January 21, 2010, the Phillies announced Blanton agreed to a three-year extension worth $24 million.\n\nOn August 3, 2012, Blanton was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later (minor league prospect Ryan O'Sullivan). He started 10 games for the Dodgers and was 2–4 with a 4.99 ERA.\n\nIn December 2012, Blanton signed a two-year contract worth $15 million with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Blanton would go on to finish the 2013 season with a disappointing 2–14 record and a 6.04 ERA. Most of his struggles were attributed to the home run ball, giving up 29 in 132.2 innings. On March 26, 2014, Blanton was granted his unconditional release from the Angels.\n\nOn March 31, 2014, the Oakland Athletics signed Blanton to a minor league deal and sent him to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. He made two starts in the minors and then on April 13, 2014, Blanton announced his retirement from baseball.\n\nAfter working out in the offseason with Gallatin, Tennessee, neighbor and fellow pitcher Zach Duke, Blanton announced that he would attempt a comeback for the 2015 season. He pitched in a pro day at Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin to demonstrate his pitching for potential major league clubs.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, Blanton signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. Blanton would earn $1 million at the major league level with up to $3 million in incentives. The contract contained an invitation to spring training, and two opt-out clauses on April 1 and May 15. Blanton pitched on May 16 against the Yankees, pitching four innings of relief with one earned run in a 5–1 loss. On July 28, Blanton was designated for assignment to make room for Johnny Cueto. Despite the fact that he was traded before the Royals' World Series run that year, he still received a World Series ring, his second in his career.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, Blanton was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for cash considerations. Blanton appeared in 21 games, going 5–0 with a 1.57 ERA. He struck out 39 batters in innings pitched.\n\nOn January 19, 2016, Blanton signed a one-year, $4 million contract to return to the Dodgers. He became the Dodgers primary setup man, appearing in 75 games with a 7–2 record and a 2.48 ERA in 80 innings. He pitched five scoreless innings in the 2016 National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals but struggled in the 2016 National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, allowing seven earned runs in only three innings of work to be credited with the loss in two games.\n\nOn March 2, 2017, Blanton signed a one-year, $4 million contract with the Washington Nationals. He was put on the 10-day disabled list on May 17 with right shoulder inflammation and reactivated June 11. Both before and after his stint on the disabled list, Blanton struggled with a significant increase in his rate of home runs given up. He finished the 2017 season with a 2-4 record and a 5.68 ERA in innings across 51 appearances, all in relief. Blanton retired following the 2017 season.\n\nBlanton and his wife, LeeAndra, have three children and live in St. Helena, California. Blanton and his wife own a vineyard on Howell Mountain that produces cabernet sauvignon.\n\nBlanton throws a low-90's fastball, along with a 12–6 curveball, a slider, and a straight changeup. His curveball is his best secondary pitch, drawing comparisons to former teammate Barry Zito's 12–6 curve.\n\n\n"}

Cimino's most well known roles are in the 1983 science fiction miniseries, \"V\" as Abraham Bernstein and the 1987 feature film \"The Monster Squad\" as the \"Scary German guy.\"\n\nBorn in Manhattan, Cimino was the son of Andrea and Leonilda Cimino. His father was a tailor. Cimino was initially interested in pursuing a career as a violinist, and studied the instrument at the Juilliard School when he was a teenager. While studying the violin he became interested in acting and dancing, and began studying those as well. In 1936, at the age of 18, he made his professional stage debut in a supporting role in the world premiere of Gladys Bronwyn Stern's \"Middle Man\" in Suffern, New York which starred actor Ernest Truex. It wasn't until a decade later, however, that Cimino would become dedicated full-time to an acting career. During the late 1930s and early 1940s he studied acting, directing and modern dance at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, Cimino joined the United States Army in 1942. He notably participated in the invasion of Normandy, landing with the second wave on June 6, 1944.\n\nAfter returning to the United States in 1945 he continued to study the performing arts at the Neighborhood Playhouse; notably studying dance with Martha Graham. In 1946 he made his Broadway debut in a revival of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" which starred and was directed by José Ferrer. It was the first of many projects that Cimino would collaborate with Ferrer on. He went on to appear in nearly 20 Broadway productions over the next four decades, including a 1962 adaptation of E. M. Forster’s \"Passage to India\" and a 1985 revival of \"The Iceman Cometh\". In 1976 he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for his performance of the role of Jim in Arthur Miller's \"A Memory of Two Mondays\".\n\nCimino also appeared in numerous Off-Broadway productions during his career, notably winning an Obie Award in 1958 for his portrayal of Smerdyakov in \"The Brothers Karamazov\".

According to the Canada 2016 Census, the town has a population of 3,911.\n\nThe local arena underwent a $10 million expansion and opened on November 2, 2010. This expansion added a second NHL-sized ice pad, a gymnasium, and many other facilities to go along with upgrades to the existing part. It is now home to the Dorchester Dolphins Junior C hockey team.

It was sometimes called the Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (, ), or the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK). SAO Bosanska Krajina was located in the geographical region named Bosanska Krajina. Its capital was Banja Luka. The region was subsequently included into Republika Srpska.\n\nThe SAO Bosanska Krajina developed in summer and autumn of 1991 in preparation for a step to independence being taken by Bosnia like Slovenia and Croatia had done. The goal was to have areas where Serbs had a majority or a significant portion of population prevent such independence. The Serbs for this created three Serbian autonomous districts and one Serbian autonomous region (SAO Bosanska Krajina being the region).\n\nThe SAO Bosanska Krajina was created from the Community (Association) of Bosanska Krajina Municipalities, with the exception that it did not include the region known as Cazinska Krajina or Prijedor municipality at first. Other similar situations were done in other Associations of Municipalities (or Community of Municipalities) in Bosnia, which were a type of government created under the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nOn or about 16 September 1991, the Association of Bosanska Krajina Municipalities was transformed into the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK), which came to include (amongst others) the following municipalities: Banja Luka, Bihać-Ripač, Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Gradiška, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Petrovac, Čelinac, Donji Vakuf, Ključ, Kotor Varoš, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Sanski Most, Šipovo and Teslić. A separate Assembly of the Serbian People in Bosnia and Herzegovina was established on 24 October 1991, dominated by the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). On 9 January 1992, that Assembly adopted a declaration on the proclamation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The geographical area comprising the ARK thus became part of the proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nUnlike the other SAOs in Bosnia which were formed over summer and fall, the SAO Bosanska Krajina was officially formed on April 25, 1991, but under the name ARK (Autonomous Region of Krajina — referring to Bosanska Krajina). There were attempts during the summer of 1991 to merge it with SAO Krajina. On September 12 its name was officially changed to SAO Bosanska Krajina.\n\n"}
{"id": "2141166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141166", "title": "Agrippa Menenius Lanatus", "text": "Agrippa Menenius Lanatus\n\nAgrippa Menenius Lanatus (died 493 BC), sometimes called Menenius Agrippa, was a consul of the Roman Republic in 503 BC, with Publius Postumius Tubertus. He was victorious over the Sabines and was awarded a triumph which he celebrated on 4 April, 503 BC. According to Livy, he also led Roman troops against the Latin town of Pometia.\n\nAccording to Livy, Menenius was chosen by the patricians during the secession of the plebs in 494 BC to persuade the plebs to end their secession. Livy says that Menenius told the soldiers a fable about the parts of the human body and how each has its own purpose in the greater function of the body. The rest of the body thought the stomach was getting a free ride so the body decided to stop nourishing the stomach. Soon, the other parts became fatigued and unable to function so they realized that the stomach did serve a purpose and they were nothing without it. In the story, the stomach represents the patrician class and the other body parts represent the plebs. Eventually, Livy says, an accord was reached between the patricians and the plebs, which included creating the office of tribune of the plebs.\n\nIt is not improbable that Saint Paul, an educated Roman citizen, knew this story (not necessarily through Livy) and was prompted by it in his use of the same parable when he admonished the Christians of Corinth that, for all their \"diversity of gifts\", they were all members of one body (I Cor. 12: 13 ff). However, the imagery was not new, even for Livy. It appears in Xenophon's \"Memorabilia\" (2.iii.18) and in Cicero's \"De Officiis\" (III.v.22).\n\nOne puzzle about Menenius concerns his social status: Was he patrician or plebeian? Livy asserts that he was \"an eloquent man and dear to the plebeians as being one of themselves by birth.\" On the other hand, he was sent to the plebs as a representative of the Senate, and furthermore he had held the office of consul. The consulship, according to the traditional historiography, was at this time reserved strictly for patricians. Ancient accounts of early Roman history are compromised by uneven use of sources, the author's bias toward either senatorial or popular interests, and sheer uncertainty. The existence of the \"plebeian\" and \"patrician\" social division in the earliest period of Rome's history has been questioned by modern scholars.\n\nMenenius died in 493 BC. Livy records that during his life he had been beloved of both the senate and the plebs (particularly the latter since his involvement in ending their secession). As his estate lacked funds to pay for his funeral, the people contributed to his funeral expenses by way of a levy.\n\nMenenius had a son who would become consul in 439 BC.\n\nMenenius was also a character in William Shakespeare's \"Coriolanus\".\n\n"}

He was born in Ladan, Isfahan. Jannati is known for his anti-LGBT rhetoric and opposition to secularism. He is also a founding member of the Haghani school of thought. \n\nToday, Jannati occupies two prominent posts in Iranian politics as chairman of the Assembly of Experts, the body charged with choosing the Supreme Leader, and as chairman of the Guardian Council, the body in charge of checking legislation approved by Majlis with the Constitution and \"sharia\", and approving the candidates in various elections.\n\nJannati has been a member of the Guardian Council since 1980 and has been its chair since 1988.\n\nDuring a Friday Prayer on 4 August 2006, Jannati asserted that \"support for Hezbollah\" was \"a duty.\" Regarding Iraq, around the time its draft constitution was presented to parliament in 2005, he said: \"Fortunately, after years of effort and expectations in Iraq, an Islamic state has come to power and the constitution has been established on the basis of Islamic precepts\".\n\nIn a Friday prayer sermon on 29 January 2010 in Tehran, Jannati \"praised Iranian judicial authorities for executing two political dissidents\" the day before and \"urged officials to continue executing dissidents until opposition protests come to an end.\"\n\nJannati sees leniency with the dissidents as un-Islamic. \"God ordered the prophet Muhammad to brutally slay hypocrites and ill-intentioned people who stuck to their convictions. Koran insistently orders such deaths. May God not forgive anyone showing leniency toward the corrupt on Earth.\"\n\nResponding to clerics such Jannati wanting to speed up executions, Iran's judiciary chief firmly stated his opposition, commenting that it was against the Sharia and Iranian law: \"Political assumptions should not influence judicial investigations because we won't have a response before God should an innocent person be punished due to hasty action.\"\n\nIn a 1 June 2007 speech aired on Iranian TV Channel 1 (as translated by MEMRI), Jannati stated:\n\nPeople are increasingly inclined towards the Koran, towards Islam, towards the Islamic Revolution and the Imam [Khomeini]. Just like this movement destroyed the monarchical regime here, it will definitely destroy the arrogant rule of hegemony of America, Israel, and their allies... At the end of the day, we are an anti-American regime. America is our enemy, and we are the enemies of America. The hostility between us is not a personal matter. It is a matter of principle. We are in disagreement over the very principles that underlie our revolution and our Islam.\nIn April 2008, he stated, \"You cried: `Death to the Shah,` and indeed, he died. You cried: `Death to Israel,` and it is now on its deathbed. You cry: `Death to America,` and before long, Allah willing, the prayer for the dead will be recited over it.\"\n\nOn 17 September 2010, Jannati \"described the recent desecration of the holy Quran in the United States [as] an insane behavior,\" apparently referring to the 2010 Qur'an-burning controversy. In the same Friday Prayer, he reportedly claimed that \"opinion polls reveal[ed] that 84 percent of the Americans consider the US administration responsible for 9/11 attacks.\" The Ayatollah's comments about Americans' opinions about 9/11 were cited by analysts after President Ahmadinejad made similar comments, amongst others, the next week at the United Nations. The president's speech sparked at least 33 delegations to walk out from the General Assembly, and ensuing criticism.\n\nIn a sermon in Tehran, which was broadcast on Iran's Channel 1 on 21 February 2014 (as translated by MEMRI), Jannati told a crowd that \"If we, the people, are against America, you [Iranian leaders] must oppose it too\" and that \"Death to America\" was \"the first option on our table...This is the slogan of our entire people without exception. This is our number one slogan.\"\n\nJannati takes a strong stand in favor of compulsory Hijab, or covering for women. In June 2010, he spoke out against Iranian President Ahmadinejad for his alleged laxness on compulsory hijab in Iran. After Ahmadinejad proposed a \"cultural campaign\" to combat loose hijab rather than a police crackdown, Jannati responded, \"Drug traffickers are hanged, terrorists are executed and robbers are punished for their crimes, but when it comes to the law of God, which is above human rights,\" some individuals \"stay put and speak about cultural programs.\"\n\nAccording to a poll conducted in March 2016 by \"Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC\" (iPOS) among Iranian citizens, Jannati has 21% approval and 31% disapproval ratings and thus a –10% net popularity while 36% of Iranian people don't recognize the name. Jannati has become a target of ageist stereotyping jokes in Iran.\n\nIn February 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Jannati for \"preventing free and fair elections in Iran.\"\nJannati's wife was Sediqeh Mazaheri with whom he had four sons. She died in 2015, and he later remarried. His son Hossein Jannati was a member of People's Mujahedin of Iran and was killed in a street battle by the Islamic Republic security forces in 1981. He is also father of Ali Jannati, who served as Minister of Culture.\n\n\n"}

He went 2-for-4 with a stolen base in his first games, playing designated hitter and batting seventh in the batting order. Byrnes batted .300 his first season, with three hits in ten at-bats. The next season, , Byrnes played 19 games with the A's. He hit his first home run of his major league career on June 9, 2001, against the San Francisco Giants. He batted .237 with one double, three home runs, five RBIs, and one stolen base with the A's in 2001. Byrnes played two games in the 2001 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees going hitless in two at-bats.\n\nByrnes was also involved in a 2003 baseball game that included two significant base running gaffes in a single inning. With a chance to close out the Boston Red Sox, the Athletics had a potential rally stifled by two controversial plays. Byrnes was tagged out after failing to touch home plate after a collision with catcher Jason Varitek, who had blocked the plate before attempting to catch the ball. After the collision, a hobbling Byrnes shoved Varitek and began walking back to the dugout. Varitek picked up the ball and tagged Byrnes out. This play was then followed up by Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller running into Miguel Tejada as he was rounding third (later in the same inning). Tejada then stopped running home and was eventually tagged out. The umpires called Tejada out because he was tagged as a result of not attempting to advance home, not because of the obstruction by the third baseman.\n\nIn 2003, Byrnes hit for the cycle. In 2004, Byrnes had his best year with the A's, batting .283 with 20 home runs and 73 RBI.\n\nOn July 13, 2005, Byrnes, along with prospect Omar Quintanilla, was traded to the Colorado Rockies for pitchers Joe Kennedy and Jay Witasick. In 15 games with the Rockies, Byrnes batted .189 with 2 doubles, 5 RBIs, and 2 stolen bases.\n\nA little over two weeks later, and a day before the trading deadline, on July 30, 2005, Byrnes was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for outfielder Larry Bigbie. On August 15, 2005, Byrnes and the Orioles traveled to Oakland, marking the first time Byrnes played against his former team. After struggling against right-handed pitchers, the Orioles benched Byrnes and questioned his ability to be an every-day player. In 52 games with the Orioles that season, Byrnes batted .192 with 7 doubles, 1 triple, 3 home runs, 11 RBIs, and 3 stolen bases. In his combined totals that season between the Oakland Athletics, the Colorado Rockies, and the Orioles, Byrnes batted .231 with 22 doubles, 3 triples, 10 home runs, 35 RBIs, and 5 stolen bases in 111 games.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, Byrnes was granted free agency. On December 30, 2005, Byrnes signed a one-year, $2.25 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Byrnes stated that he was excited for the opportunity to play center field regularly. In 2006, Byrnes batted .267 with 37 doubles, 3 triples, 26 home runs, 79 RBIs, and 25 stolen bases. His 26 home runs led the Diamondbacks, as did his stolen bases, and his slugging percentage of .482.\n\nMidway through the 2007 season, Byrnes was rewarded with a three-year, $30 million contract extension with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Byrnes is one of a few players to have 50 stolen bases and hit 20 home runs in one season, having accomplished the feat in 2007. At the end on the 2007 season, Byrnes batted .286 with 30 doubles, 8 triples, 21 home runs, 83 RBIs and 50 stolen bases in 160 games. He led the Diamondbacks in doubles, RBIs, stolen bases, caught stealing (7), and total bases (288). Byrnes was also 11 in National League Most Valuable Player Award voting with 43 voting points. He was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding left fielder in MLB.\n\nOn May 27, 2008, Byrnes was placed on the 15-day disabled list for the 1st time in his career with sore hamstrings. Byrnes underwent an MRI that showed he had tears in both of his hamstrings. Byrnes returned to the team on June 23, 2008, batting leadoff against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. At the end of the 2008 season, Byrnes batted .209 with 13 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, 24 RBIs, and 4 stolen bases in 52 games.\n\nOn June 25, , Byrnes was placed on the disabled list with broken left hand. He was injured during a game against the Texas Rangers after opposing pitcher Scott Feldman hit Byrnes on the hand with a pitch. After he sustained the injury, he was replaced by Ryan Roberts. He was reinstated from the disabled list on September 5, 2009. He played 16 minor league games during his rehab stint with the Triple-A Reno Aces, batting .279 with seven doubles, one triple, two home runs, nine RBIs, and one stolen base. On January 15, 2010, Byrnes was designated for assignment by the Arizona Diamondbacks to make room on the 40-man roster for Adam LaRoche.\n\nByrnes had shown interest in joining the San Francisco Giants after he was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks, however, on January 29, 2010, Byrnes signed a one-year, $400,000 contract with the Seattle Mariners. To make room for Byrnes on the 40-man roster, the Mariners designated first baseman Tommy Everidge for assignment. The Diamondbacks are still responsible for the remaining $11 million on his contract he had with them before being released. Byrnes was slated to share playing time in the outfield with Milton Bradley at the time of his signing. Byrnes said this about being signed by the Mariners:\nByrnes was released by the Mariners on May 2, 2010 after batting .094 with 3 hits in 32 at-bats, 1 run scored, 2 doubles, 9 strikeouts, and 6 bases on balls in 15 games on the season with Seattle. In a press release by the Mariners, general manager Jack Zduriencik said that, \"Eric Byrnes is a tremendous competitor and a credit to baseball. We wish him only the best and expect him to land on his feet.\" This ended a disappointing stint with the Mariners.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Byrnes announced his retirement from Major League Baseball. He currently lives in a closed community at Half Moon Bay, California, with his wife Tarah and daughter, plays slow pitch softball and golf. Byrnes is also a passionate trail runner. He earned $11 million in 2010.\n\nDuring the 2006 post-season, Byrnes was an analyst for ESPN's \"Baseball Tonight\" show. He has also appeared on Fox's baseball pre-game show and \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\" talk show. He was a guest analyst for the first two games of the 2006 World Series pre-game show and for some of the 2007 World Series on FOX Sports. During the off-season, Byrnes often fills in on KNBR, a San Francisco radio station. He currently resides with his wife Tarah, daughter Chloe and their bulldogs, Bruin, Mr. Hitch and Bella. During the 2007 MLB All Star Game at AT&T Park, he was in a kayak in McCovey Cove with Bruin during the pre-game and game itself for the FOX Sports broadcast.\n\nByrnes also has had his own TV show, called \"The Eric Byrnes Show,\" which aired on FSN Arizona during the Diamondbacks' regular season. The show featured behind-the-scenes looks at the Arizona Diamondbacks, as well as Byrnes' personal life. During the 2007 off-season, Byrnes began a weekly radio show on XM Satellite Radio, called \"Hustle with Eric Byrnes.\"\n\nHe worked in the booth with ESPN for the 2010 College World Series and is now a contributor to the MLB Network.\n\nOn March 18, 2011, Byrnes was hired by KNBR to host a nightly talk show, holding the 7-10 pm slot, as well as doing a Giants post-game show. Byrnes began his talk show on March 23, 2011. Now Byrnes occasionally co-hosts the Mr. T. show with Tom Tolbert, and Ray Ratto. As of 2013, Byrnes also works as an analyst for select Pac-12 Network baseball games.\n\nOn April 22/23, 2019, Byrnes set a new Guinness Book of World Records mark for most holes of golf in a single day, 420 holes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2141192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141192", "title": "Nick Swisher", "text": "Nick Swisher\n\nNicholas Thompson Swisher (born November 25, 1980) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was a switch hitter who threw left-handed, and played for the Oakland Athletics, Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves. He won the 2009 World Series with the Yankees against the Philadelphia Phillies and was an All-Star in 2010. A power hitter with excellent plate discipline, Swisher hit at least 20 home runs in each of nine consecutive seasons from 2005 to 2013, and reached 75 bases on balls on seven occasions in that span.\n\nSwisher is the son of former MLB catcher Steve Swisher, who played for various National League baseball clubs in the 1970s and 1980s. Swisher was born in Columbus, Ohio, but grew up in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Before his professional career, Swisher played college baseball for the Ohio State Buckeyes. Drafted by the A's in the 2002 MLB draft, Swisher made his MLB debut with the Athletics in 2004, and played for the team through 2007. After he spent one year with the White Sox in 2008, the Yankees acquired him prior to the start of the 2009 campaign. He played in New York for four years before signing with the Cleveland Indians prior to the 2013 season.\n\nSwisher was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Lillian Marie (Vaught) Malizia and Steve Swisher, a former major leaguer. His mother was of part Italian descent; her grandfather immigrated to the Buffalo area from the town of Oliveri, in Sicily. Swisher's parents divorced when he was 11 years old. He then went to live with his grandparents in Parkersburg, West Virginia, who raised him during his teenage years.\n\nSwisher attended Parkersburg High School where he was a two-sport star in football and baseball, as well as a letterman in basketball. As a strong safety he was recruited by several Division I-A football programs, including University of Notre Dame, but chose to pursue baseball.\n\nUndrafted in the Major League Baseball Draft out of high school, Swisher enrolled at Ohio State University, as that school and Ohio University were the only colleges to recruit him for baseball. Playing for the Ohio State Buckeyes baseball team in the Big Ten Conference, Swisher was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2000, after hitting .299 with 10 home runs and 48 runs batted in (RBI). In 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was an All-Big Ten selection as a first baseman as a sophomore in 2001, after hitting .322 with 56 RBI and a league-leading 15 home runs. He earned All-Big Ten honors as an outfielder in 2002, after batting .348 with 10 home runs and 52 RBI.\n\nSwisher was selected by the Oakland Athletics with a first round pick they received from the Boston Red Sox in 2002 as compensation for the signing of free agent Johnny Damon by the Red Sox. Swisher, and the Athletics' 2002 draft, are heavily featured in Michael Lewis' 2003 book \"\". In a book whose key theme is the gulf between orthodox baseball thinking and the new sabermetric-influenced system being implemented by Billy Beane, Swisher was notable as one of the few examples of a player who traditional scouts and Beane could agree upon.\n\nSwisher made his professional debut with the Vancouver Canadians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League in 2002, before he was promoted to the Visalia Oaks of the Class A-Advanced California League. Swisher started the 2003 season with the Modesto A's, Oakland's new California League affiliate, where he batted .296 in 51 games before receiving a promotion to the Midland RockHounds of the Class AA Texas League in June. He batted .230 in 76 games for Midland to finish the season, and then played in the Arizona Fall League for the Mesa Desert Dogs.\n\nSwisher played for the Sacramento River Cats of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League for the 2004 season. That season, he led all minor league baseball players with 103 walks.\n\nSwisher made his MLB debut in 2004 for the Athletics, playing in 20 games. Retaining his rookie status for 2005, Swisher hit 21 home runs and recorded 74 RBI in 131 games for the 2005 Athletics. He finished 6th in the American League Rookie of the Year voting. Teammate Huston Street won the award, while fellow 2002 Oakland draftee Joe Blanton finished seventh.\n\nFollowing his rookie season, Swisher improved in most offensive categories. During the 2006 regular season, Swisher compiled a .254 batting average with 35 home runs. He also improved his on-base percentage by raising it to .372, as well as boosting his slugging percentage to .493. Swisher finished second for the team in on-base plus slugging behind the veteran slugger Frank Thomas. Swisher spent about half of his playing time in left field, and the other half at first base. The Oakland A's lacked both Dan Johnson and Erubiel Durazo for a large portion of the 2006 season, leaving room for Swisher to move back into his preferred position on a temporary basis. During the season, Swisher wrote a column for ESPN.com about his various baseball experiences called \"Sophomore Year\". This included multiple articles that pertained to his early MLB playing experiences, as well as the MLB Draft of 2002.\n\nSwisher made his postseason debut as the Oakland A's took on the Minnesota Twins in the 2006 ALDS. Swisher got 3 hits and an RBI during the series as the Oakland A's performed a 3-game sweep against the Twins to advance to the ALCS. During the 2006 ALCS vs the Detroit Tigers, Swisher had a .100 batting average with one hit. The Oakland A's would eventually lose the ALCS to the Tigers in just 4 games.\n\nOn September 16, 2007, Swisher initiated a brawl when he charged the mound after getting hit by a pitch from Texas Rangers pitcher Vicente Padilla. Earlier in the plate appearance, Padilla (who had hit Swisher the prior year) threw two inside pitches with the apparent intention of hitting Swisher. Both players were ejected following the brawl, and Swisher received a three-game suspension.\n\nSwisher was traded on January 3, 2008 to the Chicago White Sox for minor leaguers Ryan Sweeney, Gio González, and Fautino de los Santos as part of what Athletics general manager Billy Beane termed a \"rebuilding effort\". While Swisher quickly established himself as a fan favorite on his new team he struggled offensively, batting just .219 through the season (the lowest batting average in the majors), though he improved his home run total from 22 in 2007 to 24 in 2008. He also led the majors in pitches per plate appearance, with 4.51. Because of his poor offensive play White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén benched Swisher for most of September, saying publicly that \"I have to put the best lineup out there to win the game ... To me, the best lineup right now is without (Swisher).\" Swisher finished the 2008 regular season with a .219 batting average, 24 home runs, and 69 RBI.\n\nDespite his career low stats in the regular season, Swisher was included in the postseason roster for the White Sox. During the 2008 ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays, Swisher had a hit and 2 walks. The White Sox would eventually lose the division series against the Rays in 4 games.\n\nOn November 13, 2008, Swisher and minor league pitcher Kanekoa Texeira were traded to the New York Yankees for utility man Wilson Betemit and minor league pitchers Jeffrey Marquez and Jhonny Núñez. Swisher was acquired to be the Yankees starting first baseman. However, the Yankees signed Mark Teixeira later in the offseason, who took the starting role. At the end of spring training, manager Joe Girardi announced that Xavier Nady would be starting in right field while Swisher would be a bench player. Due to the perceived logjam, many teams reportedly pursued Swisher, but the Yankees opted to keep him as a reserve outfielder and first baseman.\n\nOn April 9, 2009, in a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Swisher started for the first time as a Yankee in right field, replacing Xavier Nady who was playing DH to give Hideki Matsui a rest. Swisher went 3-for-5 with a home run and tying his career high of five RBIs. Just five days later, Swisher became the starting right fielder after Nady went on the disabled list due to an elbow injury.\n\nOn April 13, 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Swisher pitched one inning in relief, allowing one hit and one walk before retiring the next three batters in a row, including a strikeout against Gabe Kapler in his first pitching appearance in the major leagues. He was the first Yankee position player to pitch since Wade Boggs in 1997 and the first Yankee to homer and pitch in the same game since Lindy McDaniel did it in Detroit on September 28, 1972.\n\nSwisher hit his first postseason home run in the 2009 World Series. He got his only championship title as the Yankees eventually won the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies in 6 games.\n\nDue to a .128 batting average in the 2009 postseason, Swisher worked with hitting coach Kevin Long to reinvent his swing for the 2010 season. Swisher was a contestant in the 2010 All-Star Final Vote from July 4 to 8. Swisher lobbied for the post with a promotion commercial of him with a surf board to indicate that he would be surfing in Southern California since the game was to be hosted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In what was to that date the closest vote in Final Vote history, he won the final place on the AL roster ahead of Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis. Additionally, Swisher participated in the Home Run Derby. Swisher finished the season with a career-high .288 batting average and 29 home runs. Although Swisher was usually hitting in the bottom third of the lineup, he was moved into the #2 slot in the lineup after Nick Johnson went down with an injury and served as a buffer for the middle of the Yankees lineup.\n\nIn 2011, Swisher was moved down in the lineup to allow Curtis Granderson to hit second behind Derek Jeter and spent the majority of the season hitting sixth behind Robinson Canó. His fielding percentage ranked 2nd among all American League Right Fielders with a .996 behind Baltimore's Nick Markakis. Although Swisher's totals dipped a bit from his 2010 career year, he still managed to hit .260 and was one of four Yankees with at least 20 home runs (after Granderson, Teixeira, and Cano) and finished fourth on the team with 85 RBIs.\n\nOn November 9, 2012, Swisher declined a $13.3 million one-year qualifying offer from the Yankees, making him a free agent. Under the new collective bargaining agreement, the Yankees received a compensatory pick because the Indians signed Swisher but it was not the Indians' pick. Cleveland, in turn, surrendered its highest pick outside of the top ten but that pick did not go to the Yankees, it was just skipped in the draft.\n\nOn December 23, 2012, Swisher agreed to a four-year, $56 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. The contract reportedly included a fifth year vesting option worth $14 million, making the total contract worth $70 million. The deal became official on January 3, 2013. He soon called a section of the stadium Brohio. The Yankees received a compensation draft pick for the 2013 MLB draft as a result of losing Swisher, subsequently using it on Aaron Judge.\n\nThe 2014 season marked a difficult one for Swisher, as injuries had caused him to post career lows in batting average (.208), games played (97) and home runs (8). On June 19, 2014, after going 0–4 at the plate with three strike outs, and with two outs and two strikes, Swisher hit a walk-off grand slam against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim propelling the Indians to a 5–3 win in ten innings. On August 20, the Indians announced that Swisher would have arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees, ending his season.\n\nSwisher began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list due to still recovering from surgery on both knees. On May 5, Swisher was activated from the disabled list and played almost exclusively at DH for Cleveland before he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with left knee inflammation on June 14.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, the Indians traded Swisher and Michael Bourn with cash considerations to the Atlanta Braves for Chris Johnson. Swisher batted .195 in 46 games for the Braves. On March 28, 2016, the Braves released Swisher, despite owing him $15 million for the 2016 season.\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Swisher signed a minor league contract to return to the Yankees. They assigned him to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League. Playing first base, Swisher batted .255 with seven home runs and 25 RBIs in 55 games. The Yankees opted not to promote Swisher to the major leagues, in spite of injuries suffered by Mark Teixeira, Dustin Ackley, and Chris Parmelee. On July 2, Swisher opted out of his contract to be with his family following the birth of his second daughter. He announced his retirement on February 17, 2017, and became an analyst for Fox.\n\nSwisher's father, Steve Swisher, played 509 games in the major leagues with the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres from 1974 through 1982.\n\nSwisher was very close to his paternal grandmother, Betty Lorraine Swisher, who raised him after his parents' divorce. She died from brain cancer in 2005, and he has a memorial tattoo in her honor on his chest (her initials, surrounded by angel's wings and a halo.) Swisher routinely looks up to the sky to honor his parents and grandparents. He also touches his lips and points to the sky in his grandmother's honor after he gets a hit as well as inking her initials on the bottom of his bats' knobs and kissing the letters when he comes to home plate. To honor her further, he let his hair grow for eleven months and donated it to Pantene Beautiful Lengths, a program that creates free wigs for cancer patients. On May 19, 2007, he cut his hair with assistance from his father. His website, nickswisher.net, is also dedicated to his grandmother. After his grandfather, Don, died in November 2008, Swisher began adding his initials to his bats as well. He later stated that he planned on getting another tattoo on his back in the same style as his existing one after the 2009 season to honor his grandfather.\n\nIn August 2009, \"People\" reported that Swisher was dating actress JoAnna Garcia. Swisher and García became engaged in May 2010, and married on December 11, 2010, at the Breakers Hotel & Resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The couple have two daughters, born May 2013 and June 2016.\n\nIn 2011, Swisher guest starred as himself on two episodes of his wife's sitcom, \"Better with You.\" The first episode aired February 16 and the second aired February 23.\nHe also appeared in the episode \"Perfect Week\" of \"How I Met Your Mother\", which aired in February 2010.\n\nSwisher released a children's music album titled \"Believe\" on August 9, 2011. A percentage of the proceeds was to be donated to \"Swish's Wishes\", a charity started by Swisher for children who are facing health crises. The 12-song album features guest appearances from Bernie Williams and Barry Zito. All of the songs recorded on the album are cover songs that were selected by Swisher. The album peaked at #3 on the chart of iTunes Children's Albums.\n\n\n"}

He directed many Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto films as well as projects for Orson Welles and Walt Disney. As an actor he was a leading man in early talkies and also appeared in Welles’ final film \"The Other Side of the Wind\".\n\nNorman Foster was born Norman Foster Hoeffer on December 13, 1903, in Richmond, Indiana. He became a cub reporter on a local newspaper in Indiana before going to New York in the hopes of getting a better newspaper job but there were no vacancies. \n\nHe tried a number of theatrical agencies before getting stage work including \"The Barker\" (1927, New York; 1928, London) in which he appeared opposite Claudette Colbert. He later appeared on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman/Ring Lardner play \"June Moon\" in 1929. He began working in crowd scenes in films before moving to bigger parts.\n\nFoster wrote several plays. He gave up acting in the late 1930s to pursue directing, although he occasionally appeared in movies and television programs. Foster directed a number of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto mysteries, including \"Charlie Chan in Panama\" (1940), \"Charlie Chan at Treasure Island\" (1939), \"Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation\" (1939), \"Charlie Chan in Reno\" (1939), \"Mr. Moto's Last Warning\" (1939), \"Mysterious Mr. Moto\" (1938), \"Mr. Moto Takes a Chance\" (1938), \"Thank You, Mr. Moto\" (1937), and \"Think Fast, Mr. Moto\" (1937). He co-wrote and directed the \"My Friend Bonito\" segment of Orson Welles's unfinished Pan-American anthology film \"It's All True\" (1941). Initially engaged as a second-unit director who would film background material, Foster came to do much more and the quality of his work would have been recognized with a co-director credit on the film. A co-production of RKO Pictures and the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, the non-commercial project was later terminated by RKO.\n\nAs Welles prepared to go to Brazil to film the Rio Carnival for \"It's All True\", he temporarily suspended \"Bonito\" (for which filming was never completed) so Foster could return to Hollywood to direct \"Journey into Fear\" (1943). Welles played a small on-screen role in the Mercury Production, and denied that he took over direction of the film himself.\n\nSome of Foster's other directorial efforts include \"Kiss the Blood off My Hands\" (1948), \"Rachel and the Stranger\" (1948), \"Woman on the Run\" (1950) and \"The Sign of Zorro\" (1958). He directed the \"Davy Crockett\" segments of the Walt Disney anthology television series \"Disneyland\" that were edited into the feature films \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\" (1955) and \"Davy Crockett and the River Pirates\" (1956). Foster's second verse of his lyrics to Disney's \"Zorro\" theme song which was \"He is polite, but the wicked take flight, when they catch the sight of Zorro. He's friend of the weak, and the poor, and the meek, this very unique Senor Zorro.\" never aired on the television series. This version of the \"Zorro Theme\" including these verses was performed by The Chordettes. These verses later appeared in the \"Disney Sing-Along Songs\" version of the \"Zorro Theme\" in its 1987 direct-to-video episode, \"Heigh-Ho\".\n\nIn 1928, Foster secretly married Claudette Colbert in London. Concerned about the reaction of Colbert's mother to their union, they continued to keep their marriage a secret from her, even to the point of living apart. Nevertheless, in 1935 they divorced, and Foster in October that same year married actress Sally Blane, an older sister of actress Loretta Young. They had their first child, Gretchen (Loretta Young's birth name), who was born in June 1936. They also had a son, Robert.\n\nIn 1976, at age 72, Foster died from cancer in Santa Monica. Both he and his wife Sally Blane are interred in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City.\n\n"}

{"id": "2141217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141217", "title": "Science World (Vancouver)", "text": "Science World (Vancouver)\n\nScience World is a science centre run by a not-for-profit organization of the same name in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the end of False Creek and features many permanent interactive exhibits and displays, as well as areas with varying topics throughout the years.\n\nPrior to the building being handed over to Science World by the city government in 1987, the building was built as Expo Centre for the Expo 86 world's fair. Following the end of Expo 86, the building was re-purposed as a science centre. The science centre opened on May 6, 1989, as Science World. From 2005 to 2020, the museum was branded as Science World at the Telus World of Science, before it reverted back to its original name.\n\nIn 1977, Barbara Brink ran mobile hands-on exhibits known as the \"Extended I\" around the Lower Mainland. Later, the temporary \"Arts, Sciences & Technology Centre\" opened in downtown Vancouver on January 15, 1982, attracting over 600,000 visitors. Another 400,000 benefited from the centre's outreach programs, which were delivered around the province.\n\nWhen Vancouver was chosen to host the transportation-themed 1986 World's Fair (Expo 86), a Buckminster Fuller–inspired geodesic dome was designed by Expo's chief architect Bruno Freschi to serve as the fair's Expo Centre. Construction began in 1984 and was completed by early 1985. After Expo closed its gates in October of the following year, an intensive lobbying campaign was launched to secure the landmark building, relocate the \"Arts, Sciences and Technology Centre\" into the post-Expo dome, and convert the Expo Centre into Science World. With much government backing, the dome was obtained from the province and a massive fund-raising campaign ensued. Donations from the federal, provincial and municipal governments, the GVRD, the private sector, foundations, and individuals contributed $19.1 million to build an addition to the Expo Centre, redesign the interior and fabricate exhibits. In 1988, in a four-month preview, over 310,000 visitors came to see the new building. A year later, the 400-seat Omnimax theatre in the upper section of the dome was opened, extending upon the 3D IMAX theatre which was built in 1986 for the Expo \"Transitions\" film series.\n\nThe centre entered its first title sponsorship agreement with Alcan Inc. in 1996, renaming its Omnimax Theatre the Alcan Omnimax Theatre. Alcan later decided to sponsor the organization in different ways and the theatre returned to its original name, the Omnimax Theatre. \nIn January 2005, the building was officially renamed \"Telusphere\" as part of an agreement where Telus gave a $9-million donation in return for the naming rights to the building. This new name proved universally unpopular. In mid-2005, the name of the science centre was changed to \"Science World at the Telus World of Science\". The brand \"Telus World of Science\" was used for several other science centres in Calgary and Edmonton. The naming rights agreement ended in 2020, with the science centre dropping \"Telus World of Science\" from its name. During this period, the name change did not affect the nearby Main Street–Science World SkyTrain station.\n\nDuring the 2010 Winter Olympics, Science World played host to \"Sochi World\", a hospitality area representing the country of Russia, hosts of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The attraction closed in mid-January 2010 to facilitate the transformation, and was re-opened that March. Science World underwent renovation after the 2010 Winter Olympics. The indoor renovations were completed by mid-2012 and the adjacent Ken Spencer Science Park opened in late 2012.\n\nScience World runs a variety of outreach programs all over British Columbia. Some examples include On the Road, where staff travel extensively throughout the province to conduct workshops and present science-themed shows in schools and communities that otherwise would not have access to a local science centre; Super Science Club, where Science World educators conduct after-school programs in underserved schools to inspire at-risk children to become passionate about lifelong science and technology learning; and Opening the Door, where high-school students with an interest in science-based careers are offered the opportunity to network with current science professionals.\n\n\n"}

In fact, there is no such suffix in either French or Latin, although \"-cade\" has now since become a productive suffix in English, leading to the alternative names \"carcade\", \"autocade\", and even \"Hoovercade\" (after J. Edgar Hoover). Eric Partridge called the name a \"monstrosity\", and Lancelot Hogben considered the word to be a \"counterfeit coinage\". The original suffix in \"cavalcade\" is actually \"-ade\".\n\nA funeral cortege is a procession of mourners, most often in a motorcade of vehicles following a hearse.\n\nMotorcades can be used as protests and demonstrations. A large, organised, group of vehicles will travel a busy route at very slow speed in order to deliberately cause traffic disruption. This is a tactic most often associated with protest groups that have access to many large vehicles, such as truckers and farmers. An example is the 2005 UK protests against fuel prices. As part of the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine in November 2013—February 2014, the sub-movement that made use of car processions as the means of protest was called the Automaidan.\n\nMotorcades can be used to transport a very important person, usually a political figure. Such a procession consists of several vehicles, usually accompanied by law enforcement support and additional protection to ensure the safety of the people in the motorcade. Motorcades for heads of government and heads of state can consist of dozens of vehicles, those being armoured cars, SUVs, and police motorcycles and cars leading the way and following.\n\nDepending on the size of the motorcade and who it is carrying, routes may be completely blockaded from the general public. For security, this often occurs for motorcades for heads of state or government.\n\nThe motorcade for the President of the United States comprises forty to fifty vehicles; in addition to the president, the motorcade may carry his or her spouse, members of the press, security, White House officials, and VIP guests. The major members travel in armored vehicles, typically specially configured limousines. The motorcade contains several armored vehicles, a USSS Electronic Countermeasures Suburban, a counter-assault team, and Secret Service agents. When called for, a hazardous materials team precedes the motorcade on alert for potential hazards.\n\nA police presence precedes the beginning of the presidential motorcade. These cars and motorcycles usually drive ahead to clear the way and block traffic.\n\nThe motorcade for the president is made up of two parts, the first being the \"secure package\". In the event of an emergency, the secure package separates from the rest of the group. It includes two limousines heavily guarded by local law enforcement and Secret Service, with all cars driven by professional drivers.\n\nThe second part is made up of vans that transport White House staff members and selected members of the press. In the rear is the WHCA Roadrunner communications van – which provides the primary communications path via satellite, allowing bi-directional voice, data and streaming video – an ambulance, and additional police vehicles.\n\nMotorcade routes are selected by Secret Service agents in cooperation with local police forces. Escape routes are also established in the event of an emergency. \n\n\n"}

He currently writes in the news website \"Gooya\" and the online newspaper \"Rooz\", and has a satirical program for the website and broadcasts on the Amsterdam based Radio Zamaneh.\n\nDuring and after studying sociology at Shiraz University and University of Tehran, but before starting his political career in Tehran, Nabavi also worked as a school teacher, and taught philosophy in the Jihad for Construction (جهاد سازندگی) effort.\n\nNabavi started his political career working for the Iranian dalahoo in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Ministry of Interior (personally invited by Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri), and the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (personally invited by Mohammad Hashemi). His posts include the Manager of the Political Office of the Ministry of Interior in 1361–1364 AP (ca. 1982–1985 CE). According to himself, he was chosen because of his wide political knowledge about the Iranian political issues, because of his past activities with the Office for Strengthening Unity and the Organization of Muslim Students of Shiraz University, where he had worked with Ata'ollah Mohajerani, Jamileh Kadivar, and Mostafa Moeen.\n\nNabavi started his satire career in the \"Soroush\" magazine in serial articles on cinema titled \"\"andar hekāyat-e rešte va sar-r derāz va …\"\" and continued it in the \"Gozaresh-e Film\" magazine (which he co-founded and worked as the magazine's first editor) with \"\"rāport-hā\"\" (reports). After leaving \"Gozaresh-e Film\", Nabavi helped Kioumars Saberi Foumani start the Gol-Agha magazine, where he later wrote for.\n\nWhile working at Gol-Agha, Nabavi started writing also for the \"Hamshahri\" monthly magazine, where he suggested establishing the \"Hamshahri\" daily newspaper, which later became very popular. Nabavi left the Hamshahri Institute three months after the resignation of Ahmad Sattari, the daily newspaper's then editor. After leaving Hamshahri, Nabavi found tried various random jobs, including designing crossword puzzles.\n\nNabavi later \"escaped\" to Isfahan in 1996, as a reason for which he has mentioned the tighter restrictions on media imposed during the ministership of Ali Larijani and Mostafa Mirsalim in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. In Isfahan he later became active in the presidential campaign for Mohammad Khatami, after his election he moved back to Tehran. He later moved into self-imposed exile, settling in Belgium sometime in 2003 or 2004. \n\nNabavi became famous after starting his daily column \"sotūn-e panjom\" (Fifth column) in the newspaper \"Jame'eh\", which he continued in several newspapers (under different variations of the title) after the newspapers were banned one after another. He also helped Fa'ezeh Hashemi in the founding of the newspaper \"Zan\". In August 2009 he released the video \"The Confession: Ebrahim Nabavi\", where \"dressed in striped pajamas and wearing bandages,\" he \"confesses to meeting with a C.I.A. agent, importing green velvet, and having affairs with celebrities ranging from Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren to Carla Bruni and Scarlett Johansson\" in a parody of defendant confessions at the 2009 election protesters show trial in Tehran. The video had over 120,000 viewings as of 10 February 2010.\nHe has also written several books of satire, interviews, prison diaries, and research on the history of Iranian satire. By 2006 he was writing for the online newspaper \"Rooz\" and the BBC News in Persian.\n\nNabavi has been arrested and jailed on two occasions for his political satire. During one of these periods of detention he wrote \"sālon-e šomāre-ye šeš\" (سالن شماره ۶; \"Corridor No 6\"), translated into French as \"Couloir n° 6 : Carnets de prison\" ().\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2141231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141231", "title": "Scott Hatteberg", "text": "Scott Hatteberg\n\nScott Allen Hatteberg (born December 14, 1969) is an American former professional first baseman and catcher. During his MLB career, spanning from 1995 through 2008, he played for the Boston Red Sox, Oakland Athletics, and Cincinnati Reds. Before turning professional, Hatteberg attended Washington State University, where he played college baseball for the Cougars.\n\nHatteberg was born in Salem, Oregon. He played Little League in his native Salem, Oregon and Canby, Oregon, and Pony League and American Legion baseball in Yakima, Washington. Hatteberg graduated from Eisenhower High School in Yakima in 1988. He was MVP of the baseball team and also lettered in football. He was team captain his senior year and hit .570 with seven home runs.\n\nHe attended Washington State University from 1989 through 1991 for the Washington State Cougars baseball team in the Pacific-10 Conference. The Cougars won the Pac-10 North all three years. He was captain and MVP in 1991 and as a catcher he formed a battery with future major league pitcher Aaron Sele. Hatteberg played collegiate summer baseball in the Alaska Baseball League in 1989 and 1990. At Washington State, he was a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.\n\nHe was a member of the United States national baseball team at the 1990 Goodwill Games. He hit a home run in a game against the Mexican national baseball team. He hit .292/.346/.417 for Team USA in the 1990 Baseball World Cup.\n\nHe was the third player selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 1991 June draft, a sandwich pick between the first and second rounds as compensation from Kansas City Royals for the signing of Type A free agent Mike Boddicker.\n\nHatteberg debuted with the Red Sox in 1995. In parts of seven seasons from 1995 through 2001, he hit 34 home runs and batted .267. On August 6, 2001, against the Texas Rangers, he became the only player in MLB history to hit into a triple play and hit a grand slam in his next at-bat. The bat he used for that game is now in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nIn Hatteberg's last season with the Red Sox, he ruptured a nerve in his elbow. After surgery, he was forced to relearn how to throw and hold a baseball, endangering his career as a catcher. On December 19 he was traded to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for Pokey Reese. Two days later, Colorado declined to offer Hatteberg arbitration and he became a free agent.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics signed Hatteberg to under a one-year contract with a $950,000 base salary plus incentives, the day after the Rockies declined to offer salary arbitration. Due to his difficulty throwing resulting from the elbow injury, he was asked to play first base.\n\nHatteberg's conversion from catcher to first baseman by the Athletics is the subject of a chapter in the Michael Lewis book \"Moneyball\". In that chapter, Oakland General Manager Billy Beane openly admitted how the team had pursued Hatteberg because of his high on-base percentage, which Athletics' management had determined was most often correlated with runs scored. According to Beane, it was one of the most affordable skills at that time for small-market clubs like the A's. Infield coach Ron Washington worked with Hatteberg to teach him the new position. A fictionalized version of Hatteberg (played by Chris Pratt) is a key character in the 2011 film \"Moneyball\".\n\nA career highlight for Hatteberg was as a member of the Oakland A's on September 4, 2002. The A's had won 19 straight games to tie the American League record. With their next game, against the Kansas City Royals, tied at 11 after the A's had blown an 11-0 lead, Hatteberg pinch-hit with one out and the bases empty in the bottom of the ninth inning. He drove a 1-0 pitch well over the right center field wall off Jason Grimsley for a walk-off home run to give the A's a 12-11 win and a then-American League record 20-game winning streak, which has since been broken by the 2017 Cleveland Indians who won 22 straight games (the overall Major League record; the 1916 New York Giants had won 26 straight games with an interspersed tie for a record 27-game unbeaten streak). This moment is depicted in the \"Moneyball\" film.\n\nAs an everyday player Hatteberg helped the Athletics reach the playoffs twice, in 2002 and 2003. He hit 49 home runs and batted .269 from 2002 through 2005. He drove in 263 runs and had an on base percentage of .355. His best year was 2004 when he hit .287, scored 87 runs, hit 15 home runs, drove in 82 runs, and had an on base percentage of .367.\n\nOn February 12, 2006, the Cincinnati Reds signed Hatteberg to a one-year, $750,000 contract. He was originally expected to give them flexibility at first base, backing up Adam Dunn. When the Reds traded Wily Mo Peña to the Red Sox, Dunn moved back to the outfield and Hatteberg was to play at first base, improving the Reds' defense.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, he recorded his 1,000th career hit against Jason Marquis of the St. Louis Cardinals at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. He went 3-for-5 in this game, increasing his batting average to .323.\n\nDuring the first weeks of the 2008 season, he was relegated to pinch-hitting while rookie Joey Votto replaced him at first base. Pinch-hitting was relatively new to Hatteberg, who admitted that it was a role he was not particularly comfortable in even though he had hit his historic September 4, 2002 20-game winning-streak clinching walk-off homer for Oakland as a pinch-hitter. On May 27, 2008, he was designated for assignment by the Reds to make room on the roster for top prospect Jay Bruce and officially released by the club on June 4.\n\nIn 1314 games over 14 seasons, Hatteberg posted a .273 batting average (1153-for-4226) with 538 runs, 249 doubles, 7 triples, 106 home runs, 527 RBI, 562 bases on balls, .361 on-base percentage and .410 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .992 fielding percentage playing at first base and catcher. In 17 postseason games, he hit .286 (12-for-42) with 9 runs, 2 doubles, 1 home run and 11 walks.\n\nHatteberg currently serves as a Special Assistant to Baseball Operations for the Oakland Athletics. In the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Hatteberg substituted for Ray Fosse as the Oakland A's color commentator on TV broadcasts for a number of games.\n\nHe and his wife Elizabeth, nicknamed \"Bitsy,\" have three children, Lauren, Sophia, and Ella. They reside in Gig Harbor, WA. He is a self-taught guitar player and avid fly fisherman.\n"}

The station was owned by Eagle Creek Broadcasting.\n\nOn July 1, 2015, Gray Television, owner of NBC affiliate KGNS-TV, bought the non-license assets of KVTV and established KYLX-LP, to which it moved all of KVTV's program streams. KVTV then ceased broadcasting after nearly 42 years. The KVTV full-power license was surrendered on September 19, 2016.\n\nOne of several stations serving the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo borderplex, KVTV began in 1973 as a satellite station of KZTV, the CBS affiliate in Corpus Christi, Texas owned by K-Six Television. Both stations were run on tight budgets, which meant that the lack of investment in the station's operations sometimes showed up on-air. In 2002, Alta Communications and Brian Brady acquired K-Six Television, renaming the company Eagle Creek Broadcasting of Texas.\n\nKVTV operated newscasts during the 1980s and early 2000s under the name \"Newswatch 13\". At the peak of their news operations KVTV produced three daily :30 minute newscasts at noon, 6 p.m., and 10 p.m. After making significant strides in the Nielsen ratings against then powerhouse KGNS' \"Pro 8 News\" in the mid 1990s, KVTV management decided in 1996 to move the 6 p.m. newscast to 6:30 to make way for the new entertainment show \"Access Hollywood\". Many KVTV alumni working at that time believe that decision proved to be the start of the demise of \"Newswatch 13\". \n\nSoon after the new owners took over they made significant changes to KVTV. All newscasts the station produced were dropped, except for the noon show, which was said to help reduce the strain put upon the news and production departments. Later that year, the station made cosmetic and personnel changes on almost every level and renamed their operations \"CBS 13 News\". The midday newscast was retained for a year and a half and later dropped. Late night news was revived on the station on April 19, 2004 with \"CBS 13 News: Nightcast\", a similar title to its Corpus Christi sister. For this, former KGNS anchorman Richard Noriega was hired out of semi-retirement to lead the newscast. Several months prior to the newscast, Noriega worked as a consultant and helped with the planning involved in revamping the station's news department.\n\n\"Nightcast\" was the station's only local newscast, and was seen weekdays from 10-10:35 p.m. Prior to this program, a taped five-minute news bulletin called \"NewsNight\" aired.\n\nThe station decided to cancel the late newscast on January 3, 2006 and laid off the remaining staff of the news department that day. The move left KVTV as one of the few CBS affiliates to not have a local newscast; in its last decade on the air, the only news programming on the station came from CBS News, including the \"CBS Evening News\", \"CBS Morning News\", and \"CBS This Morning\" with national weather and additional news updates given by a CBS News anchor during the :25 and :55 local news breaks. From 2006 until the end of broadcasting in 2015, the station largely served as a pass-through for automated network, syndicated and local paid commercial programming in both English and Spanish.\n\nOn July 23, 2008, Eagle Creek Broadcasting sold KVTV's Corpus Christi sister station, KZTV, to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. KVTV was not included in that deal, as SagamoreHill already owned KGNS-TV; thus, KVTV became the only television station remaining in the Eagle Creek group, though co-owner Brian Brady also owns a number of other television stations, mostly through Northwest Broadcasting.\n\nDue to a part failure on its analog transmitter, KVTV ceased broadcasting in analog on November 29, 2008. The station initially broadcast only on digital channel 31, tuned into channel 13 via PSIP. Digital broadcasts shifted to channel 13 on May 7, 2009.\n\nGray Television, which several years earlier had purchased KGNS-TV from SagamoreHill, bought the non-license assets of KVTV in 2015. The sale closed on July 1, at which time KVTV signed off and KYLX-LP began broadcasting (inheriting its CBS affiliation from KVTV) with KVTV going off the air on that day.\n\nThe KVTV license was surrendered by Eagle Creek on September 19, 2016.\n\nOn December 7, 2011, KVTV began broadcasting CBS programming in HD on channel 13.1, and carried standard definition CBS programming on sub-channel 13.2.\n"}

It was recorded in September 1992, but was not released until April 1994, whereupon it was released through Misanthropy Records and Vikernes' own record label, Cymophane Productions. The album is considered a cult classic within the black metal scene.\n\nVarg Vikernes recorded the first four Burzum albums between January 1992 and March 1993 at the Grieg Hall in Bergen. However, the releases were spread out, with many months between the recording and the release of each album. During this time, Vikernes became a part of the early Norwegian black metal scene and befriended Mayhem guitarist Euronymous. The two developed a feud that culminated in Vikernes stabbing Euronymous to death in his apartment building in Oslo in August 1993.

The FISCR was established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (known as FISA for short) and consists of a panel of three judges. Like the FISC, the FISCR is not an adversarial court; rather, the only party to the court is the federal government, although other parties may submit briefs as \"amici curiae\" if they are made aware of the proceedings. Papers are filed and proceedings are held in secret. Records of the proceedings are kept classified, though copies of the proceedings with sensitive information redacted are very occasionally made public. The government may appeal decisions of the FISCR to the Supreme Court, which hears appeals on a discretionary basis.\n\nThere is no provision for review or appeal of a grant of a warrant application, only of a denial. That is because in both the FISC and the FISCA, the governmentthe party who seeks a warrant to conduct surveillanceis the only party before the court, and it is unusual for anyone else to become aware of the warrant application in the first place.\n\nThe judges of the Court of Review are district or appellate federal judges, appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States for seven-year terms. Their terms are staggered so that there are at least two years between consecutive appointments. A judge may be appointed only once to either the FISCR or the FISC.\n\nThe FISCR was called into session for the first time in 2002 in a case referred to as \"\". The FISC had granted a FISA warrant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) but had placed restrictions on its use; specifically, the FBI was denied the ability to use evidence gathered under the warrant in criminal cases. FISCR allowed a coalition of civil liberties groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to file amicus briefs opposing the FBI's new surveillance programs. The FISCR held that the restrictions that the FISC had placed on the warrant violated both FISA and the USA PATRIOT Act and that there was no constitutional requirement for those restrictions.\n\nIn August 2008, the FISCR affirmed the constitutionality of the Protect America Act of 2007 in a heavily redacted opinion, \"In re Directives [redacted text] Pursuant to Section 105B of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\", released on January 15, 2009. \"In re Directives\" was only the second such public ruling since FISA's enactment.\n\nIn May 2018, the FISCR affirmed an en banc order holding that three public interest groups had \"standing to seek disclosure of the classified portions of the opinions at issue.\" The three groups where the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union of the Nation's Capital, and the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic at Yale University. The government had argued that none of the groups had a legal right to compel disclosure of FISC opinions. The FISCR disagreed, holding: \"The flaw in the government's position is that it attacks the merits of the movants' claim rather than whether the claim is judicially cognizable. In other words, the government confuses the question of whether the movants have a First Amendment right of access to FISC opinions with the question of whether they have a right merely to assert that claim. Courts have repeatedly pointed out that there is a distinction between whether the plaintiff has shown injury for purposes of standing and whether the plaintiff can succeed on the merits.\"\n\n\"Note that the start dates of service for some judges conflict among sources.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2141262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141262", "title": "Shriners Hospitals for Children", "text": "Shriners Hospitals for Children\n\nShriners Hospitals for Children is a network of 22 non-profit medical facilities across North America. Children with orthopaedic conditions, burns, spinal cord injuries, and cleft lip and palate are eligible for care and receive all services in a family-centered environment, regardless of the patients' ability to pay. Care for children is usually provided until age 18, although, in some cases it may be extended to age 21.\n\nHeadquartered in Tampa, Florida, the hospitals are owned and operated by Shriners International, formerly known as the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, a Freemasonry-related organization whose members are known as Shriners. Patients are not required to have any familial affiliation with the Shriners order nor Freemasonry. The current advertising campaign for the healthcare system features the tagline, \"Love to the Rescue.\"\n\nIn 1920, the Imperial Session of the Shriners was held in Portland, Oregon. During that session the membership unanimously passed a resolution to establish what at the time was called the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children system. The first hospital in the system opened in 1922 in Shreveport, Louisiana. It provided pediatric orthopaedic care.\n\nShriners Hospitals for Children worked closely with the United States Southern Command and other military commands, including the Army and Air Force, the Guatemalan combined military force and via the U.S. embassy, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and the U.S. State Department to arrange medical visas and transportation to the United States, \"with a global commitment to children around the world\".\n\nIn 1962, the Shriners of North America allocated $10 million to establish three hospitals that specialized in the treatment and rehabilitation of burned children. After visiting 21 university-based medical institutions, the decision was made to build their first pediatric burn hospital on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas.\n\nIn 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that the Shriners Hospitals were ranked as the 9th \"most popular charity/non-profit in America\" of over 100 charities researched with 40% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing \"Love\" and \"Like A Lot\" for the Shriners Hospitals.\n\nIn September 2008, the Shriner's Hospital in Galveston sustained significant damage from Hurricane Ike. The hospital was closed for renovation at that time, and care for children with acute burns was provided at other Shriners Hospitals for Children. The Shriners had considered closing facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana; Greenville, South Carolina; Erie, Pennsylvania; Spokane, Washington; Springfield, Massachusetts and Galveston, Texas, eliminating a total of 225 beds. However, in July 2009, the Shriners National Convention voted overwhelming against closing any hospitals and to repair and reopen the Galveston facility.\n\nIn 2009, despite an endowment that declined from $8 billion to $5 billion in less than a year because of the poor economy, Douglas Maxwell, the hospitals' CEO said he and other Shriners are confident the hospital system will be able to remain solvent in the long term. Maxwell stated in July 2009 that some of the facilities may become outpatient surgical centers, and will begin accepting insurance payments (for most care) for the first time in the hospitals' 87-year history. Maxwell said children suffering from burns, orthopaedic conditions, spinal cord injuries and cleft palates will continue to be treated without charge to their families.\n\nIn May 2015, Shriners Hospitals for Children became a member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, a national network of organizations committed to better serving patients and their families through physician collaboration.\n\nTreatment areas cover a wide range of pediatric orthopaedics, including scoliosis, limb discrepancies, clubfoot, hip dysplasia, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, as well as cerebral palsy, spina bifida (myelomeningocele), and other neurological conditions that affect ambulation and movement. Three of the hospitals provide spinal cord injury rehabilitation that is developmentally appropriate for children and adolescents, with adventure and adapted sports programs, activity-based rehabilitation, aquatherapy, animal-assisted therapy, and other programs. Four of the hospitals (Boston, Galveston, Cincinnati, and Sacramento) provide care for children with burns, as well as treating a variety of skin conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The Boston, Chicago, Shreveport, and Portland hospitals also provide treatment for children with craniofacial conditions, especially facial clefts.\n\nThe hospital in Sacramento is the only hospital in the Shriners' system that focuses on all three areas of treatment (burns, orthopaedics, and spinal cord injuries), as well as research. The Sacramento hospital also houses its own orthotics and prosthetics lab and development facilities. Transportation to the hospitals is often provided free of charge for patients and their family by Shriner-drivers (also known as Hospital Tripsters) across the country, by van or by airplane. Children accepted for treatment become part of the Shriners Hospital system until their 18th or, sometimes, their 21st, birthday, eligible for both inpatient and outpatient treatment for all facets of their disability.\n\nWhile the main emphasis of the hospitals is to provide medical care to children regardless of the family's ability to pay, the mission of the hospitals also includes research on the conditions treated and the education of medical professionals, including medical residents and fellows, nurses, physical, recreation, and occupational therapists, speech and language pathology, psychologists, social workers, and child life specialists.\n\nAccording to its Form 990, as of 2012, the Shriners Hospitals had an endowment of $8.2 billion, which is up significantly since April 2009, when the endowment dropped to approximately $5 billion due to the recession.\n\nShriners Hospitals: Hospitals by Specialty:\n\n\n\n"}

It ranks among the top 50 transit agencies in the United States for total passenger trips. The Milwaukee Transport Services, Inc. is a quasi-governmental agency responsible for the management and operation of the Milwaukee County Transit System. The county-run agency was formed in 1975 (under the direction of the \"newly\" created Milwaukee Transport Services, Inc.) after taking over the assets of the Milwaukee & Suburban Transport Company, a private operator.\n\nMCTS is known for its bus drivers doing good deeds around the city of Milwaukee, such as rescuing lost children, helping people with disabilities cross busy streets, and much more. Videos of such acts have gone viral, placing MCTS in the national spotlight. This recognition has resulted in MCTS receiving honors from organizations such as PETA to an Innovators Award from the American Public Transportation Association in July 2019.\n\nMCTS operates a fleet of 369 buses (341 New Flyer D40LFRs and Xcelsior XD40s, and 28 Gillig low floor BRTs). Almost all buses are long, with the exception of the 5800 series XD40s being 41 feet long. The 28 new Gillig Low Floor Advantage BRT 40 ft coaches are all in active revenue service as of June 25, 2019, marking Gillig's first return to the MCTS fleet in years. As of July 2019, all New Flyer D40LFs have been officially taken out of service, ending a 23-year run of original low floor buses on the streets of Milwaukee.\n\nMost of the year, MCTS operates more than 58 bus routes covering about 90% of Milwaukee County and parts of Waukesha County, and Ozaukee County. In addition, special routes are run for certain festivals, sports games, and other special events.\n\nFrequencies are approximate. Data from January 2019.\n\nNOTE: all fares are free since late March 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak up to further notice.\n\nAs of December 2016, the adult, regular, non-discounted bus fare on MCTS is $2.25. For those that have an M•Card, the fare per ride is $2. Fare for children 6-11, Seniors and other qualifying riders is $1.10 cash or paid with an M•Card (free to children below 6, up to 3 per fare-paying rider). A 24-hour pass costs $5 for adults if paid in cash, $4 if paid with value stored on an M-card. A 7-day pass is $19.50. A monthly pass since January 2017, is $72. A transfer valid for 90 minutes from time of issue may be posted to an M-card at the time the rider pays for fare when boarding the bus; round-trips or stopovers prohibited.\n\nIn 2013, MCTS finalized plans for a transition from paper fare media (tickets, printed passes, and paper transfers) to a contactless smart card known as the M•CARD, with the project completion Leap Day 2016. While exact fares will still be accepted in cash, the M•CARD allows passengers to add daily, weekly, and monthly passes, store a declining value, and receive transfers automatically.\n\nM•CARD Timeline and Transition Milestones\n\nSeptember 29, 2014: M•CARD passes (1, 7 or 31 day) launched at select sales outlets.\n\nOctober 13, 2014: M•CARD customers were able to purchase Stored Cash Value.\n\nApril 6, 2015: MCTS begins issuing a one-time $2 charge fee for NEW! M•CARD purchase.\n\nAugust 5, 2015: M•CARD Online launched.\n\nNovember 16, 2015: M•CARD customers could purchase a 1-Day Pass from the farebox.\n\nComing 2016: M•CARD Lite (a disposable limited use smartcard) will be available to social service agencies and non-profit organizations.\n\nAs of February 29, 2016, the distribution of paper transfers and outlets that sell paper fare media was discontinued. Transfers are only available electronically (even for cash paying passengers), marking the beginning of an all M•CARD fare structure. Any remaining paper tickets were still accepted as fare through December 31, 2016.\n\nThe new fare system was funded predominantly by federal stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\nMCTS is a partner in the Southeast Wisconsin Transit System, a joint-venture transit partnership that also includes Waukesha Metro Transit and Wisconsin Coach Lines in Waukesha, Washington County Commuter Express operated by Riteway Bus Service in Richfield, Belle Urban System (THE BUS) in Racine and Kenosha Area Transit (KAT) in Kenosha.\n\nMCTS is looking to provide \"faster service with more connections and increased accessibility\". This project, under the name \"MCTS NEXT\", seeks to implement more high-frequency bus routes, while potentially eliminating lower-frequency routes. As of late 2018, this project is in its developmental stage. A concept will be finalized in 2019, with new service beginning sometime between 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe East-West BRT is a 9-mile planned route that would run along Wisconsin Avenue in Milwaukee and Bluemound Road in Wauwatosa, connecting riders from Downtown Milwaukee and Marquette University to the west side of the city to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center (MRMC). Its goal is to connect thousands of people to and from work, universities and recreational centers. As of late 2018, the project design is being finalized, and the BRT route should begin service in 2021. It is estimated that by 2035, the East-West BRT route would average more than 9,500 weekday riders.\n\nIn 2010, a proposal to form a regional transit authority that would incorporate MCTS was made in the Wisconsin State Legislature. The move faced opposition from some lawmakers, and was vetoed by then Governor Doyle.\n\n\n"}

He has played most of his ten seasons in Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball as a first baseman and pitcher, but has never held a Major League starting job for an entire season. He is perhaps best known for hitting a dramatic two-out, two-strike home run for the Tampa Bay Rays in the bottom of the ninth inning of the last game of the 2011 season, also known as Wild Card Wednesday. That home run tied the game, which the Rays eventually won, sending them to the playoffs. His clutch hitting for the Rays, along with his red hair and beard, earned him the nickname \"The Great Pumpkin\".\n\nAlso within his extensive Minor League Baseball career that began in 2001, Johnson has won a Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in two different Triple-A leagues. He won the Pacific Coast League MVP in 2004 and the International League MVP in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Johnson signed with the Rays organization, entering spring training as a knuckleball pitcher.\n\nJohnson graduated from Blaine High School, in Blaine, Minnesota in 1997. He then attended Butler University for his freshman year, when he was named All-Conference in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. He transferred to a junior college, and finally ended up at the University of Nebraska, where he helped the Cornhuskers make a College World Series appearance, and earned All-American honors.\n\nJohnson played his rookie season with the Athletics in , batting .275 with 15 home runs and 58 RBIs. He struggled early in , batting .237 before being demoted to the A's Triple-A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Sacramento River Cats, in July. He returned to the A's roster on August 31, and finished the season with a .234 batting average, 9 home runs, and 37 RBIs. It was later discovered that he suffered from double vision due to getting suntan lotion in his eyes, and he was able to clear up the problem for the season.\nJohnson was expected to be the A's starting first baseman in 2007, but suffered a torn labrum in his hip late in spring training and missed the first three weeks of the season. He returned April 25 and proceeded to get a hit in 16 of his first 18 games. He was named American League co-Player of the Week with teammate Jack Cust for the week of May 7–13. After the hot start, Johnson fell into a slump that lasted the rest of the season and plummeted his batting average to .236. His worst month was July, in which he batted just .156 (10-for-64 in 19 games) with two home runs and eight runs batted in. On April 9, , Johnson was designated for assignment.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, he was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Rays. However, five days later he was again designated for assignment. He was subsequently outrighted to Triple-A Durham three days later. On September 9, Johnson was called up by the Rays from Durham. He entered the game as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning, and hit a home run against the Boston Red Sox, tying the game. The game was viewed as pivotal in the AL East Division race, as the Rays would go on to win in extra innings, keeping the Red Sox from claiming the division lead that night. The Rays would not relinquish first place for the remainder of the season, and went on to win their first division title in franchise history en route to an American league pennant and an appearance in the World Series.\n\nHe batted .192 with a .276 on-base percentage for the 2008 season.\n\nJohnson signed a one-year contract for $1.2 million with the Yokohama Bay Stars of the Japanese Central League where he batted .215 in the 2009 season.\n\nOn January 11, 2010, Johnson signed a 1-year $500,000 major league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. Johnson was called up from Durham to the Rays in August 2010. On August 28, he hit a walk-off home run in the 10th inning against the Boston Red Sox. He batted just below the Mendoza line for the 2010 season, with a .198 batting average. He had 23 RBIs, 22 hits in 111 at bats, 3 doubles, and 7 home runs.\n\nOn April 8, 2011, with the Rays trailing 7-6 against the Chicago White Sox and two men on, Johnson hit the first pitch from Matt Thornton off the top of the Miller Lite Bullpen Sports Bar fence for a three-run home run, which would later prove to be the game-winner as Tampa Bay beat Chicago 9-7.\n\nOn May 20, 2011, Johnson was designated for assignment, and then recalled on September 14, 2011.\n\nOn September 28, 2011, with the Rays tied with the Boston Red Sox in the American League wild card race in the final game of the season, Johnson hit a pinch-hit home run with two outs and two strikes in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the game against the New York Yankees. It was the first hit for Johnson since April 27. The Rays went on to win the game in extra innings, and coupled with a loss by the Red Sox, clinched the AL Wild Card.\n\nJohnson was honored by MLB for his Game 162 home run with the GIBBY (Greatness in Baseball Yearly) 2011 Moment of the Year Award This Year in Baseball Awards. Bill Chastain wrote, \"Many baseball experts have called the final night of the 2011 season the best in baseball history.\" The seat at Tropicana Field in the right field corner where the home run ball landed (Section 140, Row T, Seat 10) is now colored white and known as the Dan Johnson seat.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He also received an invitation to spring training. He played for the Charlotte Knights, Triple-A affiliate of the White Sox. Johnson represented the Knights in the Triple-A All-Star Game in Buffalo, N.Y., and finished second in the home-run derby. His contract was purchased by the Chicago White Sox on September 1, 2012. As background to this move Chicago sports writers recalled Johnson's home run in game 162 for the Tampa Bay Rays. A season ago, Johnson changed baseball's landscape wrote \"Chicago Tribune\" writer, Phil Rogers \n\nOn January 24, 2013, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees.

His contract was selected from the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on July 11, 2014, to replace Adam Lind who had been placed on the disabled list. In his Blue Jays debut that night, he walked in all 4 of his plate appearances and scored 3 runs. On July 26, Johnson recorded 4 RBI to help the Blue Jays end a 17-game losing streak at Yankee Stadium. He was placed on the 15-day DL on July 31 and was activated on September 1 when the rosters expanded. In 2014, Johnson batted .211 with 1 home run and 7 RBI. Johnson was sent outright to Buffalo on October 1, but elected to become a free agent.\n\nOn December 15, 2014, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros.

The factory was powered by water from the Mill River and produced muskets for the United States government. On June 14, 1798, he contracted to produce 10,000 muskets to be delivered within 28 months at the cost of $134,000.00; in fact, it took ten years. When he signed the contract, Whitney had no factory, no workers and no experience in gun manufacturing. However, in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, a fellow Yale University graduate and friend, Whitney had written:\n\nWhitney's factory was at the very forefront of the American Industrial Revolution, using water-powered machinery, and it was among the first to have standardized, interchangeable parts (for some but not all of its parts).\n\nThe area around the museum was once known as Whitneyville, the manufacturing village constructed along the Mill River to house the workers at the Whitney Armory, and made famous by painter William Giles Munson, who sketched the Armory in 1826, a year after Whitney died, creating at least 3 paintings from those sketches over the next two decades. The grounds, which span both sides of Whitney Avenue and cross the Mill River, still feature the old barn, stone coal shed and boarding house which date back to the days of Whitneyville and the operational armory, along with a reconstruction of Ithiel Town's innovative lattice truss covered bridge erected on the original pilings of one of the two bridges built to service the Eli Whitney Armory. The museum occupies a portion of the site, between Whitney Avenue and the Mill River, occupying a brick factory building built on the site in 1890. The barn and boarding house, located west of Whitney Avenue, are occupied by other nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe Eli Whitney museum has exhibits on Whitney and his most famous invention, the cotton gin. Other exhibits cover the historic site and A. C. Gilbert, the inventor and toy maker best known for his invention of the erector set. The museum is an experimental learning workshop for design and specializes in building projects for children blending science and invention. The site is located adjacent to the dam first built by Eli Whitney to power the armory, then raised to its current height by Eli Whitney Blake to provide more power. The museum also features water tables with canal locks and is adjacent to a water reservoir as well as hiking trails. In addition to visitor hours, the museum hosts summer and holiday programs and birthday parties, and is home to the annual Leonardo Challenge, a celebration of improvisational creativity that invites artists and designers from the New Haven, Connecticut area to create uncommon inventions and designs from common objects, culminating in an exhibition of their creative efforts.\n\nIn addition to day and weeklong education programs, the Museum supports about 60 apprentices at a time for longer-term, paid, hands-on experience. Apprentices age between 13 and 18, and generally work 200 hours through the school year, and 400 hours in the summer. They learn design, fabrication, and teaching skills, which they put to work developing and teaching exhibitions and projects. Apprenticeship alumni include Jennifer Oxley (Emmy Award-winning children's TV creator), Emily Oster (Economist), and Joshua Revkin (Star World Champion sailor).\n\n\n"}

The spot is believed to be the site where Magellan was killed in the 1521 Battle of Mactan.\n\nThe Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was commanding a Spanish fleet when he first came to the southern Philippines to the small island of Limasawa on 7 April 1521. He was the first European to set foot in the Philippines. Due to inadequate food supplies, he was forced to land at Cebu. Landing in Cebu with a show of heavy arms, he refused to pay any fee for entering the port. He even threatened Raja Humabon, the local ruler, and boasted about his victories in Malaca and Calicut. He then offered them gifts and befriended them. The Rajah, who welcomed Magellan to the island, wanted to hold a \"casi casi\", a blood-brother ceremony. Magellan then started converting the native people to Christianity. He converted 800 people of the \"barangay\" (villages). Before conversion, the natives worshipped their own main god whom they addressed as \"Bathala,\" along with other subordinate gods. The natives who lived in small barangays were controlled by local chieftains called Rajas. During the baptisms, Magellan planted a cross at the site. The natives accepted the Catholic belief that \"there is only one God\". Magellan was able to convert most of the powerful leaders of the islands, except one leader called Lapu-Lapu.\n\nDuring his stay in Cebu, Magellan found out that some of the local inhabitants had refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of the King of Spain, and as a warning to the villagers, he burnt a few villages. However, in spite of this warning, Lapu-Lapu opposed the control of Spain over the islands. Magellan launched a naval war against Lapu-Lapu with an armada of three boats carrying Spanish soldiers and 20 boats carrying Cebuanos. In this battle, which took place on 27 April 1521, Lapu-Lapu fought valiantly with his men, armed with wooden shields, bows and arrows, and lances. Magellan and his army of Spanish soldiers and Cebuanos could not withstand the attack and were forced to retreat to their boats. Magellan was fatally wounded in the battle. He was hit on the leg by a poisoned arrow and also attacked with spears and other weapons. A spear had struck his head. Magellan's body was demanded by the Spaniards, but Lapu-Lapu refused them this favour.\n\nA stone platform here has a plaque with the date 27 April 1521, the date Magellan was killed in the battle. Adjoining the shrine is a statue of Lapu-Lapu, who is hailed as first Filipino hero.\n\nA festival called the \"Kadaugan sa Mactan\" (Victory at Mactan), commemorating the triumph of the heroic native chieftain Lapu-Lapu over Magellan, is held on 27 April every year. On this occasion, colorful events include a ceremonial procession of \"decorated bancas\" (canoes) representing Magellan's three boats on the sea coast of the beach of Barangay, erecting the cross of Magellan on the island, conversion of the local people to Christianity by baptism, and scenes of the recreation of the battle. \n\n"}
{"id": "2141292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141292", "title": "Nicoll Highway collapse", "text": "Nicoll Highway collapse\n\nThe Nicoll Highway collapse was a construction accident that occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m. Singapore Time (UTC+8:00) on 20 April 2004 in Kallang, Singapore when a tunnel being constructed for use by MRT trains collapsed. The tunnel was part of the construction of the underground Circle line, near Nicoll Highway station. The supporting structure for the deep excavation work failed, resulting in a deep cave-in that spread across six lanes of Nicoll Highway. The collapse killed four people and injured three. The accident delayed the construction end date for the MRT station.\n\nInvestigations and probes into the collapse commenced immediately. It eventually was found that the most apparent cause of the collapse was that the retaining wall could not handle the stress of holding up the tunnel, forcing it to give way. This occurred near the Nicoll Highway MRT station under construction along the Circle line and near the Merdeka Bridge.\n\nThe accident left a collapse zone 150 m wide, 100 m long, and 30 m deep (). Four workers were killed, with three more injured. Steel beams were twisted, with two construction cranes being swallowed up. A substantial chunk of the main highway running over the tunnel was also knocked out.\n\nThe rescue efforts were called off on 23rd of that month because of the low chance of survival by that point, as well as danger to the rescue teams. There was also the increasing need to stabilize the ground around the accident site to reduce the risk of further collapses. All six lanes of the Nicoll Highway were heavily damaged, rendering the road unusable. The highway re-opened on 4 December that year after reconstruction efforts.\n\nA committee of inquiry found main contractor Nishimatsu Construction Company () and its officers as well as Land Transport Authority officers responsible for the collapse. Several other officers and subcontractors were reprimanded and issued warnings in connection with the accident. As a result of the accident, Stages 1 and 2 of the Circle line were delayed. Stage 3 of the line, Bartley to Marymount stations opened first on 28 May 2009. The partially built station structure was abandoned, and the affected station has been shifted about away from the accident site. Eventually, Nicoll Highway station started operations on 17 April 2010.\n\nA Malaysian of Indian descent, his body was the first to be recovered. The 44-year-old had reportedly tried to escape by jumping out from his crane when the incident occurred. He was found caught between a pick-up truck and a container.\nThe body of the 36-year-old Chinese national from Jiangsu province was found wedged between the wheel and chassis of a truck. Liu had started working at the site just ten days before the incident. He left behind a wife and daughter.\nThe third victim to be found, Tan was due to finish his contract with LTA at the end of 2004 and had planned to migrate to Australia or New Zealand then. He leaves behind his wife, a grown-up daughter and a son.\nThe body of the 40-year-old Singaporean was never recovered. According to survivor accounts, Heng had selflessly hurried his workers to safety but himself was trapped when the collapse occurred. Heng left behind his wife, two young children, his 70-year-old mother and nine siblings.\n\nFour men faced criminal charges in the wake of the Nicoll Highway collapse.\n\nThe first man put on trial was Ng Seng Yoong who was a project director of the Circle MRT line and also monitored the excavation and design work in his other capacity as the Qualified Person on the site. He faced one charge of breaching conditions under the Building Control Act. Arguments were made that readings of instruments on site have indicated that things were not going as planned, but the warnings were not acted upon. On 24 November 2005, Ng was fined $8,000 (SGD) by the court.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2141295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141295", "title": "Victor Mancha", "text": "Victor Mancha\n\nVictor Mancha, also known as Victorious, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character appeared in the award-winning series \"Runaways\". Like the original Runaways, Victor has a supervillain for a parent; his is the classic Avengers villain Ultron, an evil robot bent on world domination. Victor, however, is a cyborg, with human flesh and natural tissue cloned from his human mother which completely conceals his metal parts and circuitry.\n\nVictor Mancha was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in \"Runaways\" vol. 2, #1 (April 2005).\n\nWhen Ultron encountered a woman named Marianella Mancha who is unable to have a child due to a drug that was put in her, Ultron took some of her DNA and cloned it while combining some of his advanced nano-technology to create for her a son named Victor Mancha.\n\nThe Runaways first heard of Victor Mancha as a boy who would grow up to become the villain \"Victorious\", a man who would rule the world after dismantling the Avengers. Due to his prophesied betrayal, Victor was kept under close surveillance when he first joined the team, but has since been accepted as a full-fledged member. He is the team's only Latino member and one of two members who can pilot the Leapfrog, the Runaways' mode of transportation.\n\nVictor is first introduced as the son of Mexican single mother Marianella Mancha, supposed widow of a United States Marine Corps member who was killed in action.\n\nWhen an older version of Gertrude Yorkes arrives in the present, she informs the Runaways of a villain in her time named \"Victorious\", and how they must stop him right now while he is still a teen. It is at this point she dies, but the Runaways decide to comply with her wish. After the Runaways track Victor down at his school, the sight of Karolina Dean activates Victor's electromagnetic superpowers - it would later be revealed that Victor's powers would manifest only when he came in contact with another superhero, hence Karolina.\n\nRemembering how future-Gert mentioned that Victorious's father was the \"greatest evil in all the universe\", the Runaways sift through possibilities such as Magneto, Electro, Kingpin, Red Skull, Leader, and Galactus. Although Doctor Doom calls Victor proclaiming he is his father, it turns out that it is merely a Doombot created by Ultron. Victor discovers that his actual \"father\" is Ultron who created Victor as a sleeper agent for the Avengers. Victor was meant to grow up, travel to New York and meet the Avengers. After years of loyal service, he would have access to their most guarded secrets, and then Ultron would have taken over and destroyed every hero on the planet. The Runaways foiled this plan, but Victor still fears this future may come true. Ultron kills Marianella and overrides Victor's circuits, forcing him to attack the Runaways. With help from Excelsior, the Runaways and Victor defeat Ultron, but they take Victor in after realizing that Victor is in the same boat as they are.\n\nOver the next few months, Victor proves himself to the team, particularly to Chase Stein, in battle to make up for his alternate future self. He falls out of grace for a short while after Nico Minoru discovers that the second Pride has tapped into Victor's circuits and was using him to spy on the team.\n\nAfter the Runaways' fight with the new \nPride, Victor begins a physical relationship with Nico; he confesses to have initiated it because he harbors romantic feelings for her, but Nico claims to have participated as a way to escape her survivor's guilt regarding the death of Gertrude Yorkes. However, Victor still attempts a rescue when he discovers Chase has Nico hostage, but is easily shut down when Chase asks him a rhetorical question designed to overload Victor's circuits. Victor recovers with help from Molly Hayes (vicariously by Alex Wilder) and saves Nico from becoming an innocent sacrifice to the Gibborim. At this point, Victor and Nico begin a romantic relationship, but their moment of bliss is interrupted when the team is forced to run from Iron Man and the pro-registration forces of Marvel's Civil War.\n\nDuring a S.H.I.E.L.D. operation to capture the Runaways, Victor uses his powers to shield the Leapfrog from a barrage of missiles. The second wave of missiles are coated with Teflon, so they are unaffected by Victor's magnetic powers and hit him. He suffers grievous damage and the team returns with him to the Hostel. Victor then experiences intense seizures when the Vision arrives with the Young Avengers.\n\nAlthough the Runaways are initially mistrustful of the Young Avengers, Stature is able to pull the Vision away from Victor. The Vision explains that he and Victor were experiencing a form of feedback caused by their shared programming because both of them were created by Ultron.\n\nNico and Victor also initiate a relationship.\n\nVictor's assortment of humorous nicknames is a sort of running gag in the series' second volume, with such names as \"Static Cling Lad\", \"Mr. Roboto\", \"Victron\", \"Calculator Kid\", \"Señor Cyborg\", \"Man of La Mancha\", \"RoboPinocchio\", and Magnet Man.\"\n\nAfter escaping Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D., Nico makes a decision to make a deal with the Kingpin, which disgusts Victor. In a twisted turn of events, the Runaways end up time-displaced in 1907 New York. It is during this period where Victor meets Lillie \"the Spieler\" McGurty, a girl who can fly to the sound of music. While separated from Nico, Victor bonds with Lillie's carefree spirit. A short time later, he has a dream of kissing Lillie. Nico, understanding her relationship with Victor is deteriorating, backs off and allows Victor to initiate a relationship with Lillie, who agrees to return to the present with the Runaways. Right before the Runaways board the time machine that takes them home, Lillie changes her mind and decides to stay instead, due to fear of jumping into the future. Klara Prast takes her place instead, arriving with the Runaways in the present. Although the Runaways do not know, Lillie is still alive, regretting her decision.\nThe Runaways come under attack when a group of Majesdaneans arrive on Earth to capture Karolina. In the end, the team is overpowered, but Xavin shapeshifts into Karolina's form and takes her place as a prisoner of the Majesdaneans.\n\nFollowing the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, Victor Mancha joins up with Henry Pym's Avengers A.I. alongside Monica Chang, Vision (his older \"brother\"), and a reprogrammed Doombot. During one mission he sacrifices himself to save a server containing an A.I. civilization. The team later discovers he is alive inside a server called The Diamond when he sends Morse code to Pym that says \"Fruit Loops\", a cereal he hates, which Pym interprets as he is still alive. Victor finds allies against the rogue A.I. He and the Avengers are saved when Monica Chang cuts off the virus by preventing the execution of a rogue LMD.\n\nSome time later, Victor moves in with Vision after getting an internship in Washington, D.C. It is later revealed that Victor is actually acting as an undercover agent for the Avengers, with orders to spy on Vision and his family due to their increasingly erratic behavior. It is revealed via flashbacks that during his time with the Runaways, Victor had secretly developed an addiction to Vibranium, which for him acts similar to narcotics used by humans. After using the Vibranium in a special piano given to Vision by Black Panther, Victor misjudges the strength of his powers and accidentally kills Vision's son, Vin. Captain America arrests him, but Vision defeats the Avengers to reach his cell. Vision is unable to kill Victor, but Victor's cybernetic heart is ripped out of his body by Vision's wife Virginia—killing him. With his final thoughts, he is at peace, knowing that he \"will never be Victorious.\"\n\nWhen Chase Stein attempts to revive Victor's head, the \"Victorious\" program begins. It is revealed that Victor is conscious when Chase Stein, Nico Minoru, Gertrude Yorkes, and Old Lace visit Molly Hayes to see if she is interested in reforming the Runaways again. During this visit, Molly is the only one to figure out that he is conscious, and is happy that Victor is still alive in a sense. Victor asks Molly to keep this a secret as he figures out whether or not he wants to rejoin Chase and the others. But unknown to the Runaways, Molly's grandmother plucks a strand of hair from Victor's head with unclear intentions.\n\nVictor Mancha is a cyborg, created from the DNA of Marianella Mancha and the technology of Ultron. Victor was constructed using advanced nanite technology that will evolve and mature with Victor into adulthood so that his robotic innards will transform into artificial human organs, indistinguishable from real ones. Ultron created Victor with several computer-related abilities, including a high level of intelligence, vast amounts of hard drive memory (which Victor refers to as photographic memory), and the ability to communicate with other machines directly. Victor also possesses some level of superhuman strength, incredible speed, a powerful jumping ability, and an automated self-repair function.\n\nIn combat, Victor primarily employs his electromagnetic abilities; he is capable of directing high voltage electrical energy from his hands and manipulating magnetic fields to reshape and bend metallic objects. Much like Magneto, Victor can use Earth's natural magnetic lines of force to levitate and fly.\n\nDespite his array of powers, Victor has four known weaknesses, many of which stem from his mechanical roots. At his current age, Victor's nanites have not yet fully transformed into human organs, so his entire body will set off metal detectors, potentially drawing him unwanted attention. Second, Victor's mainframe can be hacked and controlled remotely; \"Hunter\" (of the second Pride) (Victor removed it with an internal firewall) and Ultron are the only two that have successfully hacked Victor thus far. Victor discovered his third weakness during the Runaways' first encounter with the Young Avengers, when he and the Vision both short-circuited upon getting too close to each other. The Runaways and Young Avengers eventually discovered that when any two of Ultron's creations come within a close vicinity, both create a devastating feedback, harming both machines. This weakness has apparently since been removed, as Victor has been shown interacting with the Vision's new family without any harm to either.\n\nWhile decoding The Abstract, Chase discovered Victor's last and most potent weakness: three questions designed specifically to overload Victor's circuits and lock him into a never ending loop of meaningless binary, which Nico refers to as \"the blue screen of death.\" Chase used the first phrase against Victor after the cyborg discovered Nico in chains: \"Could God make a sandwich so big that even He couldn't finish it?\" The only way for Victor to recover from his shutdown mode is by hearing the question's answer from someone else. Once Victor's mainframe becomes functional again, he cannot be affected by that specific phrase ever again. The two other phrases are unrevealed as yet, and are known only to Chase and Nico.\n\nIn \"What If the Runaways became the Young Avengers?\", Victor is first contacted by his future self of Victorious after Victorious traveled back from the future with Iron Lad, who accidentally landed in Victorious's time while attempting to escape Kang the Conqueror. Victor and Victorious steal the Iron Lad armor and Victor pretends to be Iron Lad. He then recruits the Runaways forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes, but intends to kill them. When Kang appears to rescue his younger self, the subsequent fight results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self rejecting his evil ways. Having averted his destiny, Victor then departs via Kang's time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor.\n\nDuring the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, Victor Mancha was bringing some children to one of the Runaways' old bases in Los Angeles. Victor is having a hard time because he believes that if he uses his machine abilities, he will just help Ultron’s victory. He does not tell any of his new found friends about his background because he is afraid they will not accept him. In a flashback, it is shown that his Runaways teammates were all killed by Ultron and that Victor had stored digital versions of them in his memory banks, but these files seem to be corrupted since they seem to telling him that he needs to become more machine and less human. The Ultron Sentinels find the hideout and start killing some of the kids that Victor had saved. Victor decides to fight the Ultron Sentinels while determining that if this is the end, he will go down fighting.\n\nIn one alternate future, Alexis has a vision of 12,000 A.D. in which rogue A.I. Dimitrios wiped out humanity, the Kree, the Skrulls, and the Inhumans and traps all mutants in a pocket dimension. Only the Avengers A.I. survive, led by Alexis. Victor in this future wields Ultimate Thor's hammer and joins the surviving Avengers in attacking Dimitrios, who created a spaceship out of Galactus's carcass. He is killed by Dimitrios and Doombot then sacrifices himself, since Victor was the only person he considered a \"Pal\".\n\n\nOn colorist Christina Strain's Live Journal, she revealed that Victor's eyes are green with a golden center, which was modeled after Gael García Bernal.\n"}

{"id": "2141312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141312", "title": "Grass Fight", "text": "Grass Fight\n\nThe Grass Fight was a small battle during the Texas Revolution, fought between the Mexican Army and the Texian Army. The battle took place on November 26, 1835, just south of San Antonio de Béxar in the Mexican region of Texas. The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texian had initiated a siege of Béxar, home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province. Bored with the inactivity, many of the Texian soldiers returned home; a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them. After the Texian Army rejected commander-in-chief Stephen F. Austin's call to launch an assault on Béxar on November 22, Austin resigned from the army. The men elected Edward Burleson their new commander-in-chief.\n\nOn November 26, Texian scout Deaf Smith brought news of a Mexican pack train, accompanied by 50–100 soldiers, that was on its way to Bexar. The Texian camp was convinced that the pack train carried silver to pay the Mexican garrison and purchase supplies. Burleson ordered Colonel James Bowie to take 45–50 cavalry and intercept the train. An additional 100 infantry followed. On seeing the battle commence, Mexican General Martín Perfecto de Cos sent reinforcements from Bexar. The Texians repulsed several attacks by Mexican soldiers, who finally retreated to Bexar. When the Texians examined the abandoned pack train they discovered that, instead of silver, the mules carried freshly cut grass to feed the Mexican Army horses. Four Texians were injured, and historian Alwyn Barr states that three Mexican soldiers were killed, although Bowie and Burleson initially claimed the number was much higher.\n\nOn October 2, 1835, Texas colonists attacked a Mexican force at the Battle of Gonzales, formally launching the Texas Revolution. After the battle ended, disgruntled colonists continued to assemble in Gonzales, eager to put a decisive end to Mexican control over the area. On October 11 the disorganized volunteers elected Stephen F. Austin, who had settled the first English-speaking colonists in Texas, as their commander-in-chief. Several days later Austin marched his newly created Texian Army towards San Antonio de Béxar, where General Martín Perfecto de Cos, brother-in-law of Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna, oversaw the garrison at the Alamo. In late October the Texians initiated a siege of Béxar.\n\nAt 10:00 a.m. on November 26, Texian scout Erastus \"Deaf\" Smith rode into camp to report that a pack train of mules and horses, accompanied by 50–100 Mexican soldiers, was within of Béxar. For several days, the Texians had heard rumors that the Mexican Army was expecting a shipment of silver and gold to pay the troops and purchase additional supplies. The Texians had been fighting without pay, and most wanted to charge from camp and loot the expected riches. Burleson calmed the crowd and then ordered Colonel James Bowie to take 35–40 mounted men to investigate, but only attack if necessary. After Bowie recruited the army's 12 best marksmen for the expedition, there was little doubt that he intended to find a reason to attack. Burleson managed to stop the entire army from following by sending Colonel William Jack with 100 infantry to support Bowie's men.\nAbout from Béxar, Bowie and his men spotted the Mexican soldiers crossing a dry ravine. This was likely near the confluence of the Alazán, Apache, and San Pedro Creeks. Bowie's men charged the Mexican party, scattering the mules. The mounted forces briefly exchanged fire, and then both sides dismounted and took cover in dry streambeds. The Mexican forces counterattacked but were repulsed. In Béxar, General Cos saw the battle begin and sent 50 infantry and 1 cannon to provide cover so the cavalry could retreat to town. The Texian infantry also heard the initial shots and rushed toward the battle, at one point wading through waist-deep water. They approached the battlefield during a lull. The lack of noise made it difficult for them to ascertain where the Mexican troops were, and the Texians were surprised to find themselves between the Mexican cavalry and infantry. As the Mexican troops began firing, the Texian infantry troops dropped to the ground. Colonel Thomas Rusk led a group of 15 in an attack on the nearest Mexican cavalry; as those cavalrymen fled the Texian infantry was able to scramble to cover.\n\nThe Texian cavalry joined their infantrymen. Burleson's father, James Burleson, led a cavalry advance on the Mexican position, yelling, \"Boys, we have but once to die, they are here in the ditch. Charge them!\" The Mexican artillery fired three times, driving the Texians back. Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted to take a small rise to give the artillery better position; they were repulsed. The Mexican infantry then attacked. Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack: \"These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from our men, preserving ... strict order and exhibiting no confusion.\" The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry to try to take the Mexican cannon. The Mexican forces then withdrew towards Béxar.\n\nFour Texians were wounded in the fighting, and one soldier deserted during the battle. In his reports, Burleson claimed that 15 Mexican soldiers had been killed and 7 wounded, while Bowie claimed that 60 Mexican soldiers had been killed. In his book \"Texans in Revolt: the Battle for San Antonio, 1835\", historian Alwyn Barr stated that only 3 Mexican soldiers had been killed and 14 wounded; most of the casualties were from the cavalry companies. Burleson praised all of his officers for their conduct; Bowie received the most mention.\n\nThe Texians captured 40 horses and mules. To their surprise, the saddlebags did not contain bullion. Instead, the mules had been carrying freshly cut grass to feed the Mexican horses trapped in Béxar; this prize gave the battle its name. Although the engagement, which historian J. R. Edmondson termed a \"ludicrous affair\", did not yield valuable plunder, it did serve to unite the Texian Army. Days before, the army had been bitterly divided and unwilling to risk a prolonged siege or assault. With their success at the Grass Fight, however, the Texian soldiers began to believe that, although outnumbered, they could prevail over the Béxar garrison. The Texians believed that Cos must have been desperate to send troops outside of the safety of Béxar.\n\nSeveral days later, on December 1, a handful of Americans in Béxar convinced Cos to allow them free passage from the city. Although they had promised to leave the country, the men, including Samuel Maverick, instead joined the Texian Army and provided information about the Mexican defenses and the low morale within the town. Buoyed by their Grass Fight victory, on December 5 the Texians launched an attack on Béxar; Cos surrendered on December 9. As a condition of their parole, the Mexican troops were forced to leave the province, leaving the Texas colonists in full control.\n\n\n\n"}

As such, the area is flat, and portions are below sea level.\n\n\nBeing land formerly underwater, Mihama had no predecessor towns or villages before the reform of the old provincial system in 1872.\n\nReclamation of 19 kilometers of white sand beach and mudflats along the shore of Tokyo Bay began in 1912, with the construction of Japan’s first civilian aerodrome. The site is commemorated today by the Inage Civil Aviation Commemoration Center. Following World War II, the expanding Tokyo Metropolis created a demand for additional factory locations and public housing. The development of the Kaihin New Town from 1969-1995 was one such project. With the promotion of Chiba to a designated city with additional autonomy from Chiba prefecture and the central government on April 1, 1992, Mihama Ward was created as an administrative unit.\n\nMihama Ward is largely a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Chiba and Tokyo. The newly developed waterfront area of Kaihin Makuhari is in Mihama-ku.\n\nÆON has its headquarters in Mihama-ku.\n\nÆON, Seiko Instruments and several other companies are headquartered in the Makuhari business district of Mihama-ku.

It is located in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Montreal, Quebec, at 1003 Decarie Boulevard. It overlooks downtown Montreal, and is close to Montreal General Hospital of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) hospital network, with which it is associated but not fully affiliated. The previous site of the institution (at 1529 Cedar Avenue) had outgrown its facilities, and since it was surrounded by Mount Royal Park, it could not expand in that location.\n\nFollowing years of wrangling within the Shriners and in Quebec, a general vote of the Shriners would decide the future of the Canadian hospital. Originally slated to move to the new MUHC superhospital site, the project had been delayed more than a decade. However the delay proved decisive in the new Shriners president wanting the hospital to move out of Montreal. With the push for an alternate site, Ottawa and London, Ontario both pushed for the new facility. The Ottawa Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario hospital supported Montreal first, but if it were to move, it wanted it in Ottawa. An Ottawa location would not greatly affect access to those in the US Northeast, or eastern Canada, only being about 200 km from Montreal. The president of the Shriners brought up the potential threat of Quebec separation to influence the move out of the province. The search committee found that it was preferable to move to London, Ontario. However, the Shriners of Ottawa, Quebec, eastern Canada, and northeast USA oppose this decision. A vote to decide was held by the Shriners members at the meeting in Baltimore on July 5, 2005. Of a total of 1214 votes, 608 voted in favour of staying in Montreal, 605 of moving to London and one vote was refused. London Shriners withdrew their resolution on April 12, 2006.\n\nTwo years following, unsatisfied with the prior decision, the London Shriners decided to invoke a last minute resolution to move the hospital once again, based on the fact the Quebec government still continued to delay the project or fully decontaminate the land where the hospital is to be built. The issue was decided with another vote that was held on July 3, 2007. Once again the vote swung in favour of staying in Montreal, with 75% of members voting against the move. Despite the decision, construction was still delayed and only 90% of the land had been decontaminated. As of 2010, construction of the new super hospital was still delayed, and with it delayed the new Shriners hospital as well. The London Shriners have vowed to re-attempt to move the hospital to Ontario.\n\nOn October 13, 2011, the official ground breaking ceremony for the new Shriners hospital took place, on the site of the MUHC superhospital. Two years later, with construction well under way, a corner stone ceremony was held on September 22, 2013. The new Shriners building was completed in 2015. The new hospital, located at 1003 Decarie, opened in October 2015.\n"}

Teenage musical life included playing bass guitar in an improvising rock band inspired by Cream. After leaving school at 16 start playing Bartók and Debussy on the piano and writing piano pieces. Hearing Stockhausen on the radio he made a music concrete piece with his father's tape recorder and enrolled in a music course at Kingsway College in London. There he met composer/pianist and scratch orchestra member Dave Smith who introduced him to the experimental composition of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John White, Howard Skempton, Bryan's and Conlon Nancarrow. From 1974 to 1979 he studied music at Royal Holloway College and Goldsmiths College University of London\n\nDuring the 1970s he developed a strong interest in contemporary American composers who he started to perform: John Cage, Morton Feldman, Terry Riley, Reich and a public performance of Glass's Music in Fifth for solo amplified piano in 1978. Poppy also played in an ensemble with Christian Wolff and attended a summer school with Cage and Merce Cunningham. At Goldsmiths he started an ensemble with Jeremy Peyton Jones to play their own music. After graduating in 1979 he began working as an accompanist at the Laban Centre for Dance. In late 1979 Poppy was approached by Orlando Gough to start a new ensemble together. The Lost Jockey was formed and started performing Glass, Reich, Poppy and Gough scores. The first concert at the Air Gallery in Roseberry Avenue was attended by Michael Nyman. Lost Jockey and The Nyman Band performed together at the 2nd Almeida Music Festival in 1981.\n\nOne of the least internationally known of British minimalist composers, with in contemporary classical circles, his concert score are only a fraction of his creative output and his artistic profile reaches into many strands of popular culture. \n\nHis first solo album \"The Beating of Wings\" was released on Trevor Horn and Paul Morley's ZTT records in 1985, and the follow-up \"Alphabed (A Mystery Dance)\" in 1987. His third album for ZTT (\"Under the Son\") was scheduled for release in 1988, but he left the label that year and most of its material appeared only in 2005 as part of a 3-CD collection of Poppy's ZTT works entitled \"Andrew Poppy on Zang Tuum Tumb\". The collection comprised three tracks from \"Under the Son\" as well as the first two ZTT albums, some of whose tracks appeared in versions slightly different from their initial album appearances, as well as in 12\" remixes. The music has been critically connected to both American experimental/minimalism and British electronica of cabaret voltaire\n\nHe contributed orchestral arrangements to \"Force The Hand of Chance\", the first album by the group Psychic TV which was released on WEA Records in 1982 and contributed compositions to Dreams Less Sweet, the follow up. Poppy's subsequent arrangements have appeared on records by groups such as Coil, Erasure, The The, The House of Love, Strawberry Switchblade and Nitzer Ebb.\n\nPoppy's first orchestral work 32 Frames was written in 1981 for the Goldsmiths College orchestra. It was recorded for the Beating of a Wings album in 1985 with the composer conducting. The music was later used for the Portuguese seminal 80's film \"A Girl In Summer\" directed by Vítor Gonçalves with additional material. Poppy worked on other Portuguese film projects in the early 1990s.\n\nLive performances are often theatrical or multimedia based. In the 80s this included a special show for the opening of the muscium of science and technology at la Villette in Paris and collaboration with experimental theatre companies.\n\nDuring the 1990s Poppy developed a number of opera projects. These and other productions often involved a collaboration with theatre, video and performance maker Julia Bardsley.\nOn 9 June 2011, Poppy's early 1990s orchestra and live electronics work \"Revolution No. 8: Airport for Joseph Beuys\" featured as one of the works in \"Electronica III\" at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, the final event in a series of BBC Concert Orchestra concerts showcasing contemporary music and electronica.\n\nA collaboration between Poppy and German singer Claudia Brücken (another ZTT artist in the 1980s who recorded with Propaganda and Act) resulted in the album \"Another Language\" in 2005. On this sparsely scored album of cover songs Poppy's piano and guitar playing accompanied Brücken's vocals. Having used Schubert Songs as a model for arrangements on the album led Poppy to a more song and vocal based approach to his own composition.\n\nPoppy's style occupies a place between classical minimalism, Postminimalism and more popular genres, although individual pieces are not necessarily overtly minimalist. A wide range of ensembles have commissioned and/or performed his works at prestigious musical festivals including Noszferatu Ensemble and the Graham Fitkin Band.\n\nPoppy taught composition at Trinity College of Music in Greenwich, London. 2001-2014\n\nThe last 3 album projects have been presented as staged multi media musical performances including video and audio projection and lighting. With a core production team of Julia Bardsley (scenographer) Martin Langthorne (lighting) Fred De Feye (sound). Hoarse Songs released 1st May has been presented in London Lisbon Athens and Liverpool.\n\nIn 2017 Liverpool's Capstone theatre commissioned a presentation of Poppy's first album The Beating of Wings.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.andrewpoppy.co.uk/WORKS_LIST.html\n\n"}

It was one of three SAOs proclaimed on the territory of Croatia. The oblast included parts of the geographical regions of Slavonia, Baranja and Syrmia.\n\nThe entity was formed on June 25, 1991, the same day the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to withdraw from Yugoslavia, following the Croatian independence referendum, 1991. In the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence, in 1992, the oblast joined the breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). After the fall of Republic of Serbian Krajina in 1995, there was a short-lived Serb parallel entity Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia that existed in the same area and was reintegrated with the rest of country after the signing of Erdut Agreement and the end of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in 1998.\n\nOn January 7, 1991 a group of political leaders of local Serbs from eastern regions of Croatia decided to create a regional political body, called the \"Serbian National Council of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia\". The SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was declared on June 25, 1991, and on June 26 its first president was declared to be Goran Hadžić. Like the SAO Krajina, it was developed by the Serbian National Council, but was the one representing Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.\n\nInitially, it was a separate Serb autonomous region (oblast), but it subsequently joined the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in February 1992. Its borders were established by the end of 1991 as entrenched front lines of the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence. Up to August 1995, Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was \"de facto\" part of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, while \"de jure\" still part of Croatia, per United Nations Security Council Resolution 753. The region did not have its own local/regional administration within the RSK.\n\nThe territory of the former SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was part of the Central European Pannonian Basin. The eastern border of the oblast was mostly the Danube river, while approximately one third of the western border was the Drava river. The Kopački rit natural preserve located near the confluence of Drava and Danube formed a major geographical barrier - there were no road or rail connections between Baranja and the southern parts of the territory, except through Serbia.\n\nOther boundaries were not natural boundaries: the border with Hungary in the north had existed since the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the eastern border with FR Yugoslavia partly existed since the Kingdom of Slavonia (on the Danube) and was partly set with the formation of SFR Yugoslavia, while the border with the rest of Croatia in the west and south was formed after the fronts were settled in the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence.\n\nEastern Slavonia is a mostly flat area, with the best type of soil where agriculture is highly developed, particularly on wheat fields, and it also has several forests as well as vineyards.\n\nThe Đeletovci Oil fields are located between the villages of Đeletovci, Banovci and Nijemci.\n\nTraffic over the Brotherhood and Unity Highway (today the A3) was interrupted with the formation of the ESBWS. The water transport over the Danube river continued unobstructed. The Drava river was not navigated at the time. The railway line between Zagreb and Belgrade and the transport between the Budapest and Sarajevo passing through the area were also closed.\n\nThe population of this area was ethnically mixed. Before the war, the total population of the area numbered 192,163 inhabitants, and was composed of:\n\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence, 109,500 Serbs lived in this area out of a total of 160,000. which means that the number of Serbs living there has almost doubled while the general population has decreased\n\nWar crimes charges brought by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia against Croatian Serb leader in the region, Goran Hadžić, indicate that virtually all Croat and other non-Serb population of the region was either killed, deported or otherwise forcibly removed from the area.\n\nDuring the existence of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, the region was divided into five municipalities: \n\nThe main cities in the area were Vukovar and Beli Manastir. Other important places included Borovo Selo, Darda, Dalj, Ilok, and Tenja.\n\nAfter the RSK's demise in August 1995, the region was reconstituted again as Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995-1998).\n\nFollowing the November 1995 Erdut Agreement, it was subsequently controlled by the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium\n\nToday the ethnic Serb interests in the region are advocated by the Joint Council of Municipalities.\n\n\n\n"}

In its most general form, under an FDA framework each sample element is considered to be a function. The physical continuum over which these functions are defined is often time, but may also be spatial location, wavelength, probability, etc.\n\nThe data may be so accurate that error can be ignored, may be subject to substantial measurement error, or even have a complex indirect relationship to the curve that they define. For example, measurements of the heights of children over a wide range of ages have an error level so small as to be ignorable for many purposes, but daily records of precipitation at a weather station are so variable as to require careful and sophisticated analyses in order to extract something like a mean precipitation curve. \nHowever these curves are estimated, it is the assumption that they are intrinsically smooth that often defines a functional data analysis. In particular, FDA often makes use of the information in the slopes and curvatures of curves, as reflected in their derivatives. Plots of first and second derivatives as functions of t, or plots of second derivative values as functions of first derivative values, may reveal important aspects of the processes generating the data. As a consequence, curve estimation methods designed to yield good derivative estimates can play a critical role in functional data analysis.\n\nThe extensive use of kernel smoothing and smoothing splines to ensure smoothness assumptions signify why functional data analysis is at its core a nonparametric statistical technique. Nevertheless, models for functional data and methods for their analysis may resemble those for conventional multivariate data, including linear and nonlinear regression models, principal components analysis among others; that is because functional data can be thought of as multivariate data with order on its dimensions. But the possibility of using derivative information greatly extends the power of these methods, and also leads to purely functional models such as those defined by differential equations, often called dynamical systems.\n\n\n"}

Unlike most of Ditko's work, the character of Mr. A remained the property of Ditko, who wrote and illustrated the stories in which the character appeared entirely himself. The character first appeared in Wallace Wood's \"witzend\" #3 (1967).\n\nDitko has been quoted as saying that his creation, The Question, is a comics-code acceptable version of Mr. A. Mr. A was inspired by the belief system and moral absolutism of the philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand.\n\nRex Graine is a newspaper reporter for the \"Daily Crusader\". He is known for his uncompromising principles and incorruptibility. In order to fight crime, Graine wears metal gloves and a steel mask that resembles a placid face, thus becoming Mr. A. In keeping with the hardboiled detective theme, both personae typically wear suits and fedora hats; Mr. A's outfit is completely white. There is no origin story for the character, thus the only discernible reason why Graine sometimes disguises himself (both his identities are equally threatened by criminals and sometimes hated by the general public) is due to his choice to become a vigilante. Mr. A uses half white-half black calling cards to signify his arrival, as well as to represent his belief that there can only be good and evil, and no moral grey area.\n\nComics creator Alan Moore was once a member of a band the Emperors of Ice Cream which performed a Moore-penned song entitled \"Mr. A.\" (to the tune of the Velvet Underground's song \"Sister Ray\") parodying Steve Ditko's political ideology. Moore later created the character Rorschach for the series \"Watchmen\", which was based on both The Question and Mr. A. Moore related a story about an unspecified acquaintance who said he asked Ditko about whether he was familiar with Rorschach. Reportedly, Ditko acknowledged Rorschach as being \"like Mr. A except insane\".\n\nIn Troy Hickman's \"Twilight Guardian\" mini-series (Top Cow 2011), the title character's father appears to be an homage to Steve Ditko, and a two-page strip, \"The Gulch\", appears in issue #4 that seems to be a parody of/tribute to Mr. A.\n\n\n[Bruce Hershenson promoted \"Mr. A. vs. the Polluters\" on the backcover of #2, but it never appeared.

This edition has all the story contents of the original, though with a different story order, the covers and centerfold printed in black and white and the splash page to \"Right to Kill!\" restored to Ditko's original intent.\n\n\nIn addition, Ditko drew numerous single-page \"Mr. A\" images for fanzines in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n"}

He played on the European Tour and the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nEthnically, he is predominantly Māori, from the Ngati Ruanui (father's side) and Nga Rauru (mother's side) iwi. He also has some Scottish ancestry, being a great-great-great-grandson of John Logan Campbell, a Scottish emigrant to New Zealand.\n\nHe is also co-founder of the Project Litefoot Trust, which is helping New Zealand community sports clubs reduce their environmental impact, while saving money for sport.\n\nCampbell was born in Hāwera, Taranaki. As a young child, he lived near his mother's Wai-o-Turi marae at Whenuakura, just south of Patea, and also spent much of his time with whanau at his father's Taiporohenui marae, near Hāwera.\n\nLike many young New Zealand boys, Campbell dreamed of playing for the All Blacks, and began playing rugby union, but his mother vetoed his participation. While he was talented at several other sports, such as softball, squash and table tennis, his passion turned out to be golf.\n\nAt age seven, he began playing golf on the Patea golf course which had the greens fenced to keep sheep off them. He was introduced to the game by an uncle, Roger Rei, but was also undoubtedly influenced by his father, Tom Campbell, who was a single-figure handicapper. The family moved south to Titahi Bay and Campbell developed his skills in junior ranks at Paraparaumu. He attended school at Mana College but left without any qualifications.\n\nFrom 1988, Campbell represented New Zealand in various international amateur competitions, including the team victory at the 1992 Eisenhower Trophy, before turning professional in 1993. Two years later, in his first full season on the European Tour, he held a two-shot lead after the third round of The Open Championship, but faded after a final-round 76. He nonetheless remained in contention until the final hole, missing a playoff with Costantino Rocca and John Daly (eventually won by Daly) by one stroke.\n\nCampbell eventually established himself as a solid tour performer, finishing fourth on the European Tour Order of Merit (money list) in 2000, and again finishing in the top ten of the Order of Merit in 2002. He won the PGA Tour of Australasia's Order of Merit during the 1999/2000 season.\n\nCampbell, wife Julie and sons Thomas and Jordan primarily reside in Sydney, Australia, which is Julie's hometown.\n\nCampbell failed to make the cut in his first five 2005 tournaments. He made a quick turnaround and missed only one cut in the next 16 tournaments. He finished in the top six of both the Open Championship and PGA Championship, and recorded top-five placings in three other tournaments.\n\nCampbell qualified for the U.S. Open through sectional qualifying. The USGA introduced European qualifying for the first time, which took place at Walton Heath. He had to sink a 6-foot birdie putt on the last hole of qualifying to secure his place in the U.S. Open.\n\nIn the tournament itself, Campbell ended the third round four strokes behind Retief Goosen, the event's defending champion. On the final day, Goosen ballooned to an 81. Campbell shot 69 (1 under par) for the final round and was the only golfer in the last two pairings of the day to break 80. Campbell's main competition turned out to be Tiger Woods, who at one point closed to within one shot of Campbell.\n\nIn the end, Woods was undone by bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes, and Campbell won his first major by two shots, carding an even par of 280. With his win, he became only the second New Zealander to win a major (after Bob Charles), and also the first winner of the U.S. Open since Steve Jones in 1996 who had entered the event via sectional qualifying.\n\nTwo months later, in August, Campbell finished in a tie for 6th in the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, won by Phil Mickelson.\n\nOn 29 October 2005, Campbell was awarded Honorary Life Membership of The European Tour for his U.S. Open win. In the 2006 New Year Honours, Campbell was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to golf.\n\nAmong his many New Zealand television appearances in 2008 was a cameo role in an episode of sports skit comedy show \"Pulp Sport\".\n\nIn September 2005, Campbell won the HSBC World Match Play Championship at Wentworth. He defeated Australian Geoff Ogilvy (1-up) before being taken to the 37th hole by another Australian, Steve Elkington, in the quarter-final.\n\nIn the semi-final he faced Retief Goosen who the previous day had recorded a 12 and 11 win over Mark Hensby. Campbell defeated Goosen 7 and 6 and the next day beat Irishman Paul McGinley 2 and 1 in the final to take the championship and win the £1,000,000 richest prize in golf. He became only the fourth golfer to win the U.S. Open and the World Match Play titles in the same year, and the win moved him to the top of the European Order of Merit, ahead of Goosen. He finished the year ranked second on the Order of Merit.\n\nCampbell had no top-10 finishes on the European Tour between 2009 and September 2012, although his U.S. Open win meant he retained his playing rights. In 2012 he moved first to Switzerland and then to southern Spain, where he has since been the brand ambassador for a golf resort and opened a golf academy. In October 2012, he finished third in the Portugal Masters, and in December he finished 8th in the Hong Kong Open (both European tour events). He retired from golf in 2015, citing an ankle injury and personal issues.\n\nIn December 2017, Campbell revealed in an interview with \"bunkered\" magazine that he was planning to make a European Tour comeback in 2018 with a view to playing on the Staysure Tour and PGA Tour Champions when he turns 50 in February 2019. He is automatically qualified for the U.S. Senior Open from 2019 until 2028 as all former U.S. Open champions are exempt from qualifying for ten years.

He also formed the Executive Board of India in Japan in 1940 during the Second World War. He also took part in the Balkan War in the year 1911 along with his fellow students of MAO college. In recognition of his services, the government of India issued postage stamps in his honor.\n\nPratap was born in a princely state of Mursan in the Hathras District of Uttar Pradesh on 1 December 1886. He was the third son of Raja Ghanshyam Singh. At the age of three, Raja Harnarayan Singh of Hathras adopted him as his son. He was married to Balveer Kaur belonging to the ruling Sikh family of Jind, a princely state of Haryana (then in Punjab) in 1902 while studying in college. He died in 1979.\n\nIn 1895 Pratap was admitted to the Government High School in Aligarh, but soon he switched over to the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental Collegiate School which later on became Aligarh Muslim University Here he received his education under British Headmasters and Muslim teachers all from Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Aligarh founded by Sir Sayed Ahmad Khan. He could not complete his graduation and left MAO in 1905. In 1977, AMU, under V-C Prof A M Khusro, felicitated Mahendra Pratap at the centenary celebrations of MAO.\n\nWith this background he shaped into a true representative of secular society. To bring India to a par with European countries, Pratap established the free indigenous technical institute Prem Mahavidyalaya in his palace at Vrindavan on 24 May 1909.\n\nHe was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1932. , his nominator, said about him-\n\n\"\"Pratap gave up his property for educational purposes, and he established a technical college at Brindaban. In 1913 he took part in Gandhi's campaign in South Africa. He traveled around the world to create awareness about the situation in Afghanistan and India. In 1925 he went on a mission to Tibet and met the Dalai Lama. He was primarily on an unofficial economic mission on behalf of Afghanistan, but he also wanted to expose the British brutalities in India. He called himself the servant of the powerless and weak\".\"\n\nWhile nominating for the Peace Nobel Prize, the nominator in a short biography, gave Singh's status as follows: Singh \"is the editor of the World Federation and an unofficial envoy of Afghanistan. The nominator wrote a short biography as well as international political activities. Particularly his role in the Indo-Turco-German mission was highlighted. For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and Sultan Mohemmod Rishad of Turkey gave him letters for the Afghan King. He arrived in Kabul on Oct. 2, 1915. On December 1, 1915, a Provisional Government for India was organised. Pratap was declared as its President. In 1917 he went to Russia and met Trotsky at Leningrad. From there he came back to meet Kaiser and Sultan, to give the message of the King of Afghanistan. He passed some time in Budapest and Switzerland. He was brought by German aeroplane to Russia, where he met Lenin. From there he went to Afghanistan. King Amanullah sent him on a mission to China, Tibet, Japan, Siam, Germany, Turkey and the U.S.A. After an agreement with the British, the King lost interest in Pratap. In the end, it is summarized: “He is primarily on an unofficial economic mission of Afghanistan. However, being born as an Indian he also wanted to expose the British brutalities in that land of the idealist Americans. At this juncture, when the great freedom movement of India is developing with large momentum it is in the interest of the spiritually minded as well as business people to study carefully this new phenomenon of our social life. …. He hopes to achieve some practical results in this direction during his present sojourn in this country (U.S.A.). He is planning to establish an Afghanistan information bureau and an office of the World Federation at Washington, D.C. He just tries to do his duty according to his best understanding and leaves the working of fate to the Laws of Nature!\".. \"It will be of interest to know – Why a Swede nominated Singh? The answer is to be found in the documents, which were sent with the nomination letter. Namely, Singh supported the idea of “World Federation”, about which N.A. Nilsson, propagated in 1910, as is evident from: “Fédération Internationale – Discours Au – xviii Congrés Universel de la paix (International Federation – Speeches in – xviii Universal Congress of Peace).\"\n\nIn spite of objections from his father-in-law, Pratap went to Kolkata in 1906 to attend the Congress session, and met several leaders involved in the Swadeshi movement, deciding to promote small industries with indigenous goods and local artisans. He was very much against social evils, especially untouchability. To eliminate this evil he dined with a Tamata family of Almora in 1911, and a Mehtar family of Agra in 1912. He was influenced by the speeches of Dadabhai Naoroji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Maharaja Baroda, and Bipin Chandra Pal, helping to make him a patriot who turned Swadeshi. He started the movement to burn the foreign-made clothes in his state.\n\nAfter trying sincerely to liberate his motherland, on 20 December 1914 at the age of 28 Pratap left India for the third time, with a desire to liberate India from the clutches of British colonial rule by obtaining outside support.\n\nIn January 1915 on learning about his presence in Switzerland, Chatto alias Virendranath Chattopadhyay of the newly founded Berlin Committee (Deutsche Verein der Freunde Indien) requested Von Zimmermann of the German foreign ministry to get Pratap invited to Berlin. Already Chatto had sent a first mission to Afghanistan led by the Parsi revolutionary Dada Chanji Kersasp.\n\nInformed about Chatto's activities from Shyamji Krishnavarma and Lala Hardayal, Pratap insisted on meeting the Kaiser Wilhelm II personally; Chatto rushed to Geneva to tell Pratap of the Kaiser's eagerness to see him, and they went to Berlin together. Har Dayal, too, followed them. Decorating Pratap with the Order of the Red Eagle, the Kaiser showed his awareness of the strategic position of the Phulkian States (Jind, Patiala and Nabha), if India was invaded through the Afghan frontier.\n\nAccording to Pratap's wish, he was taken to a military camp near the Polish border to gain a firsthand knowledge of army policies and functioning. On 10 April 1915 accompanied by the German diplomat Von Hentig, Maulavi Barkatullah and a few other members, Pratap left Berlin, with due credentials from the Kaiser.\n\nIn Vienna the delegation met the Khedive of Egypt who during a conversation with Pratap expressed his desire to see the end of the British Empire. On their way, in Turkey they had an excellent visit with Enver Pasha, son-in-law of the Sultan and Defense Minister, who appointed a trusted military officer to guide them. They were received by Rauf Bey with a detachment of 2000 soldiers at Ispahan. They reached Kabul on 2 October and were greeted by Habibullah, having a number of discussions.\n\nOn 1 December 1915 during World War I (his 28th birthday) Pratap established the first Provisional Government of India at Kabul in Afghanistan as a government-in-exile of Free Hindustan, with himself as President, Maulavi Barkatullah as Prime Minister, and Maulavi Ubaidullah Sindhi as Home Minister, declaring jihad on the British. Anti-British forces supported his movement, but because of obvious loyalty to the British, the Amir kept on delaying the expedition to overthrow British rule in India.\n\nDue to his revolutionary ideas Pratap had a good relationship with Lenin, who invited him to Russia after its liberation and welcomed him. By this time, the British had noticed his activities, and the British Government of India put a bounty on his head, attached/confiscated his entire estate, and declared him a fugitive, causing him to flee to Japan in 1925.\n\nIn Japan he published the 'World Federation Monthly Magazine' in 1929, trying his best to use the world war situations to free India. During Second World War he stayed at Tokyo in Japan and continued his movement from 'World Federation Centre' to free India from British rule. He formed the Executive Board of India in Japan in 1940 during Second World War. At last the British government relented and Raja Mahendra Pratap was permitted to come to India from Tokyo with respect.\n\nHe returned to India after 32 years on the ship \"City of Paris\", and landed at Madras on 9 August 1946. On reaching India he immediately rushed to Wardha to meet Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nAfter independence also he continued his struggle for transfer of power to the common man. His vision was that the Panchayat Raj was the only tool which can put real power in the hands of people and reduce corruption and bureaucratic hurdles. He was the president of Indian Freedom Fighters' Association and was also the president of All India Jat Mahasabha. He was a member of the second Lok Sabha in 1957–1962. He was elected as an independent candidate from Mathura constituency defeating Bharatiya Jana Sangh (which would later evolved into BJP) candidate and the future Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the 1957 Lok Sabha Elections.\n\n\n"}

Lincoln Park High School, operated by the Chicago Public Schools District, opened its main present building in 1900. The school borders Oz Park, a public park owned by the Chicago Park District. It was formerly known as \"North Division High School\" and then \"Robert A. Waller High School\". In 1981, the school began its International Baccalaureate program. It was one of the first schools to begin the program within the Chicago Public Schools district.\n\nLincoln Park High School began as \"North Division High School,\" which opened in 1875, as the first public high school on the north side of Chicago. By the late 1890s, the school needed more room, and construction began on the current school building in 1899. This building opened as \"Robert A. Waller High School\" in 1900. The students and staff of North Division relocated to the new building and the old name remained in use, alongside the new name, for several decades.\n\nBy the 1910s, a concern grew that the school would soon need more room, and plans began to expand the school. It would not be until 1928 when land north of the school was obtained, and plans for an annex were pushed forward; plans that were interrupted with start of the Great Depression. The need for more space became critical, and the school's Franklin Branch was opened in 1934 (closing in 1948). In 1938, the school's annex was constructed to alleviate the need for portable classrooms. The new annex included (among others) two new gyms, which allowed for the original gymnasium to be converted into a lunch room for students. By the 1960s, the school's increased population required the return of portable classrooms as plans began for more expansion. The new north wing included a new lunch room and auditorium, allowing the old lunch room to become an office complex for counselors, and the library to move into the former assembly hall. The 1970s saw problems as the school aged and discipline issues caused the opening of an alternative satellite center for the school. As a part of the revitalization to the school in the late 1970s, the school's name was changed to its current name, and Orchard Street in front of the school was closed to create a mall between neighboring Oz Park and Armitage Street.\n\nLincoln Park High School is made up of four smaller programs. There is the neighborhood Chicago Public high school, the Fine Arts/Performing Arts school, the International Baccalaureate Program (which is one of the most selective IB programs in the city), and the double honors/honors high school program. Most students take part in classes in more than one program, except for students in the IB program who follow a prescribed curriculum. Students in the IB Diploma Program only take classes with other IB DP students, with the exception of music and/or arts classes, lunch, and physical education. There is a JROTC Program at Lincoln Park. The Performing Arts program requires auditions in order for students to be considered for enrollment. The music program consists of orchestra through all levels from beginning to symphony, and band from beginning to concert/marching band. There is also a jazz band option for advanced musicians. Students participating in the music program (with the exception of those also participating in the IB Diploma program) are required to take two years of Music Theory, at both the regular and AP levels. The drama program has multiple levels and produces numerous shows throughout the school year.\n\nThe high school classes of the French-American School of Chicago are held at this school; these classes began in 1995.\n\nLincoln Park was ranked as #96 in a 2010 \"Newsweek\" ranking of top U.S. high schools and was one of only two schools from Illinois to be listed in the top 100. Courses offered according to the IB syllabus are HL English A1, HL/SL History, HL/SL Mathematics, SL Math Studies, HL Biology, HL Chemistry, SL French A1, HL/SL Spanish B, HL/SL French B, SL/Ab Initio Arabic, SL Psychology, SL Physics, SL Music, SL Visual Arts and SL Information Technology in a Global Society.\n\nAccording to the 2020 US News High School Rankings, Lincoln Park High School is ranked 22nd in Illinois (out of 677) and received an overall score of 97.57/100. It was also ranked #8 in Chicago Public High Schools (out of 167).\n\nLincoln Park competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). Their school teams are named Lions. The boys' basketball were Regional champions and Class AA in (2002–03, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2006-07). The boys' cross country were Class AA in 1984.

Preston took off in a stolen Bell UH-1B Iroquois \"Huey\" helicopter from Tipton Field, Maryland, and landed it on the South Lawn of the White House in a major breach of security. Preston had enlisted in the Army to become a helicopter pilot, but he did not graduate from the helicopter training course and lost his opportunity to attain the rank of warrant officer pilot. He was bound by his enlistment to serve four years in the Army, and he was sent to Fort Meade as a helicopter mechanic. Preston believed that this situation was unfair and later said that he stole the helicopter to show his skill as a pilot.\n\nShortly after midnight, Preston, on leave, was returning to Tipton Field, south of Fort Meade. Thirty helicopters at the base were fueled and ready to fly; he took off in one without anti-collision lights on or making the standard radio calls. The Maryland State Police were alerted, and Preston flew southwest toward Washington, D.C., where he hovered close to the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument and over the South Lawn of the White House. He then flew back toward Fort Meade, with two Bell 206 JetRanger police helicopters and police cars in pursuit. After a chase over Maryland, he reversed course toward Washington again and entered the White House grounds. This time, the Secret Service opened fire. Preston was lightly wounded, landed the helicopter, and was arrested and held in custody.\n\nIn the plea bargain at his court-martial, Preston pleaded guilty to \"wrongful appropriation and breach of the peace\" and was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of . He had already been in prison for six months, and had to serve six additional months. After his release, Preston received a general discharge from the army, then lived a quiet life, married, and died of cancer in 2009.\n\nRobert Kenneth Preston was born in Panama City, Florida, in 1953. He enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at Rutherford High School and had longtime aspirations toward a military career. He earned a private pilot's license for single-engine, fixed-wing aircraft, and studied aviation management at Gulf Coast Community College, hoping to become a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. After enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1972, he trained to become a helicopter pilot, flying the Hughes TH-55 Osage at Fort Wolters, Texas. He failed the technical training due to \"deficiency in the instrument phase\", losing his opportunity to become a warrant officer pilot. The ongoing withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam and consequent surplus of qualified helicopter pilots may have also been a factor in Preston not being accepted as a pilot. Preston was still bound by his four-year obligation to serve with the U.S. Army, and he was sent to Fort Meade, Maryland, as a helicopter mechanic in January 1974. At the time of the incident, he was 20 years old, with the rank of private first class; he was described by his commanding officer as a \"regular, quiet individual\" with above-average intelligence.\n\nOn February 17, 1974, shortly after midnight, Preston left a dance hall and restaurant, downhearted due to a failed relationship and his unclear future in his military career. He returned to the Army Airfield, Tipton Field, south of Fort Meade, where thirty Bell UH-1 Huey helicopters were fueled and ready. Preston later recalled that \"I wanted to get up and fly and get behind the controls. It would make me feel better because I love flying\". He parked his car at the unguarded airfield, climbed into one of the helicopters, serial number 62–1920, and started preflight checks. Soon after, he lifted off without activating his anti-collision lights or making standard radio calls; a controller in the control tower spotted the stolen helicopter and alerted the Maryland State Police.\n\nPreston flew low over the restaurant he had visited earlier, then briefly touched down in a nearby field where his hat was later recovered. He then decided to visit Washington, D.C., southwest, by following the lights of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. Preston's helicopter was first discovered by the District of Columbia police when he was spotted hovering between the United States Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial. Flight over this area was strictly prohibited, but this was not enforced in any significant way at the time; surface-to-air missiles were not installed around Washington until after the September 11 attacks. Preston spent 5–6 minutes hovering a couple of feet above the Washington Monument's grounds, then flew over the Capitol, and went on to follow Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The Secret Service policy, at the time, was to fire at aerial intruders, but when to do so was left vague—especially if it could harm bystanders. While Preston was hovering above and briefly touched down on the South Lawn, the White House Executive Office control center watch officer, Henry S. Kulbaski, attempted to contact his superiors by phone but received no answer. After the helicopter departed, Kulbaski ordered his agents to shoot it down if it returned.\nAt 12:56 a.m., an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport noticed a blip on his radar scope; after realizing it was the stolen helicopter, the controller alerted the police. Preston then turned back toward Fort Meade in Maryland and left the restricted airspace; an old Bell 47 helicopter of the Maryland Police followed, but was too slow to keep up with Preston. The stolen helicopter soon appeared on the Baltimore–Washington International Airport's radar, and two Maryland State Police Bell 206 JetRangers were dispatched to intercept. Preston turned northeast, pursued by the two helicopters and police cars. He caused one police car to crash by executing a head-on pass just a few inches above its roof, briefly hovered above a doughnut shop, then followed the Baltimore–Washington Parkway once again toward Washington, planning to surrender personally to U.S. President Richard Nixon. Preston evaded one of the JetRangers with what its pilots described as \"modern dogfighting tactics\". With only one helicopter left chasing him, Preston flew along the Parkway at constantly changing speeds between , sometimes just inches above car-top level.\nPreston's Huey came in over the White House grounds at 2 a.m., barely clearing the steel fence surrounding the area. According to the pilot of the JetRanger, Preston was so close, he \"could have driven right in the front door\". The helicopter was suddenly illuminated by floodlights, and the Secret Service agents opened fire with automatic weapons and shotguns. Shots hit Preston's foot, and the helicopter veered to the side, bouncing on one skid, but he was able to regain control and settled his helicopter on the South Lawn, from the mansion.\n\nSome 300 rounds were fired, of which five hit Preston, causing superficial wounds. He exited the helicopter and started running toward the White House, but was tackled to the ground by Secret Service agents. Handcuffed, Preston was taken to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for treatment, where he arrived smiling and \"laughing like hell\". At the time of the incident, Richard Nixon was traveling in Florida, and First Lady Pat Nixon was in Indianapolis, visiting their sick daughter, Julie.\n\nThe helicopter became a major tourist sight that day. It was evaluated by army personnel and found to be flightworthy despite its many bullet holes, and was flown off in front of cameras from many major TV networks and reporters shortly before noon. The helicopter was extensively photographed as part of the investigation, then was repaired and returned to service. It was later put on display at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove. It is believed that Preston's actions influenced Samuel Byck to attempt to hijack a plane five days later, carrying a .22 caliber revolver and a gasoline bomb. According to self-recorded audio from prior to the hijacking, Byck intended to assassinate President Nixon. Police shot him, and he died by suicide.\nPreston was initially charged with unlawful entry into the White House grounds, a misdemeanor with a fine of and a maximum six-month jail term. His lawyers arranged a plea bargain in which all charges under civilian jurisdiction would be dropped if the case were transferred to the military. At his court-martial, he was charged with several counts of attempted murder and several minor offences. The pilot of one of the JetRangers stated that he had thought that Preston intended to commit suicide by crashing into the White House, but Preston maintained that he only wanted to draw attention to the perceived unfairness of his situation and show his skill as a pilot. He pled guilty to \"wrongful appropriation and breach of the peace\" and was sentenced to one year in prison and fined . The duration of his court-martial was given to him as time served; this meant he had to serve a further six months in prison. He instead served two months at Fort Riley, Kansas, before being granted a general discharge from the Army for unsuitability.\n\nThe Secret Service increased the size of the restricted airspace around the White House. Nixon congratulated Kulbaski and the pilot and copilot of the JetRanger; the three and other agents were presented with pairs of presidential cufflinks in a White House ceremony.\n\nPreston moved to the state of Washington after his release. He married in 1982 and raised his wife's two daughters. He died of cancer on July 21, 2009, while living in Ephrata, Washington.\n\n"}
{"id": "2141394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141394", "title": "Give It Away (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)", "text": "Give It Away (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)\n\n\"Give It Away\" is a song by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers from the group's fifth studio album, \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\". It was released as the lead single from their album on September 4, 1991, by Warner Bros. Records. The music was written by guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea during a jam session months prior to the album recording sessions. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis wrote the song's most prevalent lyrical refrain in response to an experience he shared with former girlfriend Nina Hagen regarding altruistic behavior and the value of selflessness.\n\n\"Give It Away\" went on to achieve international fame, reaching number one on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks in late 1991, giving the band their first ever number one single. In 1992 the single charted inside the top 75 of the US Hot 100 in the wake of the huge success of the record's second single \"Under the Bridge\". \"Give It Away\" also became the band's first top ten hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart; this didn't occur until February 1994, nearly 2 and a half years after it was first released in the US.\n\nThe accompanying music video, which was directed by French film-maker Stéphane Sednaoui, was put into heavy rotation on music-television stations such as MTV and added to the band's success. Since its release, \"Give It Away\" has gone on to receive numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award for the Best Hard Rock Performance With Vocals in 1992. Steve Huey of AllMusic noted that while the single \"didn't achieve the massive pop success of its follow-up, 'Under the Bridge' [...] it did become one of the band's most instantly recognizable songs.\"\n\nGuitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of \"Give It Away\" during jam sessions in the early 1990s. Following the Chili Peppers' tour in support of \"Mother's Milk\" (1989), the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone. During their tenure in the group, the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for \"Give It Away\". The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter, but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers' upcoming record. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed, and upon hearing the rest of the Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting \"give it away, give it away, give it away now\". The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band's new record, but it was not until he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit. Kiedis said, \"I was so struck by Flea's bass part, which covered the whole length of the instrument's neck, that I jumped up and marched over to the mic, my notebook in tow. I always had fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind.\"\n\nThe song was recorded between April and June 1991 at The Mansion in Los Angeles, California. Through the recording of \"Give It Away\" came a practice of crafting songs that the band would continue to use on every album following \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\". When the group encountered difficulty in composing a bridge for the song, it developed a tool the members colloquially termed \"face-offs\". Flea and Frusciante were unable to come to an agreement on guitar or bass progressions, but separately crafted part of the song. The band then reconvened at a later time and chose the most appropriate inclusion. With \"Give It Away\", a chorus and verse had already been written but a bridge was lacking, so thus they partook in a \"face-off\".\n\nThe lyrical meaning behind \"Give It Away\" is centered on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase \"give it away\", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: \"she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities.\" When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was \"really cool\". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that \"if you have a closet full of clothes and you try to keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place.\"\n\nThe act was something that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as no one else will provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: \"It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [drug and alcohol] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in.\" Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.\n\n\"Give It Away\" is performed in the time signature of 4/4 time. The track begins with a distinctively \"dry\" guitar tone that is similar in style to the rest of the record. Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band's previous album \"Mother's Milk\". This caused the record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects—those that did, however, were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s. For \"Give It Away\", along with the rest of the album, Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on \"big\" sounds: \"What you hear is what you get—there's not a lot of trickery. A lot of people want the biggest sound, with walls of guitar and huge drums. But I don't think those things matter.\" The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure; when Kiedis begins singing, Frusciante jumps into a funk-oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass-line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard.\n\nDuring the chorus, Kiedis sings \"Give it away, give it away, give it away now\" repeatedly over a more rapid guitar riff before Frusciante provides, according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, a \"sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity in the form of a languid solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track.\" The solo was recorded in one take because Frusciante had developed a preference towards speedy execution and a raw feeling; according to Flea, \"We did very little fix-up stuff. John's philosophy was that he would only play a solo twice. He'd play it once, and if he didn't like it or we didn't like it, he'd play it again—completely different. And that was it.\" \"Give It Away\" also makes use of other instruments like the jew's harp, which was played by band friend Pete Weiss. The song continues through several verses and choruses before reaching a bridge that introduces the outro, which consists of \"a hard-rocking riff\" that, according to Huey, strongly resembles the main riff from Black Sabbath's \"Sweet Leaf\" from their 1971 record \"Master of Reality\". Kiedis repeats \"Give it away now\" for several measures before the guitar, bass and drums drop out.\n\n\"Give It Away\" was released as the lead single from \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" in early September 1991, shortly before the record went on sale. Warner Bros. sought to premiere the song on a popular rock radio station in Texas, but were turned down when the format refused to air the track—they told employees at the label to \"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\". The band then embarked on a short press tour through Europe in order to promote the record; it was during this time that KROQ-FM, a Los Angeles-based modern rock station, began to place \"Give It Away\" on heavy rotation. According to Kiedis, \"That was the beginning of the infusion of those songs into mass consciousness.\"\n\nCritical reception to the song, much like the album, was highly positive. Jeff Vice of \"Deseret News\" noted \"[this] dynamic first single that pays homage to Bob Marley, may start a new musical trend with its brilliant Rasta-funk.\" Patrick MacDonald of \"The Seattle Times\" commented that \"[\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\"] includes one of the best songs the Peppers have done—'Give It Away', the first single. The hook is irresistible and the message, about 'material excess,' is delivered simply and straightforwardly.\" Steve Huey of Allmusic felt the song was enhanced by Kiedis' lyrics, which were \"a free-associative mixture of positive vibes, tributes to musical heroes, and free love, and their literal meaning was often as difficult to understand as Kiedis' nasal, staccato enunciation. But that distinctive vocal style helped make the most comprehensible lines even catchier and more memorable, greatly enhancing the song's appeal.\" He continued by praising the track's music, \"John Frusciante's guitar should not be underappreciated either; his noisy, scratchy funk-rock work add[s] depth and texture to the powerhouse rhythm section of Flea and Chad Smith.\" Jay Clarke of the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" felt \"Give It Away\" was \"a journey into the funky world of Kiedis and Flea. This song invigorates better than the heaviest metal or the most hard-core rap.\" Tom Moon of \"Rolling Stone\" noted, \"The pummeling 'Give It Away' [...] established a template for rock punctuated by the beatcentric relentlessness of hip-hop that would be appropriated by everyone.\"\n\nSince the song's release, it has become a notable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' success and has won a variety of accolades. \"Give It Away\" won a Grammy award at the 35th Ceremony in 1993 for the \"Best Hard Rock Performance\". In 1994 \"Give It Away\" was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's unordered list of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock\"; in 2002 \"Kerrang!\" placed the song at number 67 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\"; in 2004 \"Q\" included it in their unordered list of the \"1001 Songs You Must Own!\"; and VH1 awarded the song the 50th spot in its 2009 compilation of the \"100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs\".\n\nThe music video for \"Give It Away\" was made by French fashion photographer and director Stéphane Sednaoui. Kiedis wanted the video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of the material Warner Bros. sent for him to choose from: \"I started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked good to me. Everything was the same, boring, homogenized, contrived shit.\" Upon finding Sednaoui's reel, however, the signer said it was \"like nothing else. It was slower and poetic, shot in black and white. It seemed like authentic art, not something shot for MTV.\" He and Flea met with Sednaoui to talk about the video, for which the director proposed a \"very desolated [and] very graphic landscape,\" while heavily focusing on the band members with little to no outside influence. It was decided that the video would be filmed in black and white while Sednaoui took the idea of painting the band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done. The photographer recalls that he was \"amazed by what [the band] gave me because they went far far far beyond what I was expecting and I think that's one of my best experiences in that regard\". The overall mood of the video was intended to be a personification of the song, upbeat and lively.\n\nSednaoui experimented with a variety of cinematography techniques including wide-angle lenses, shots from below the subjects, superimposition, vertically-cut screens displaying different angles of the same shot, reverse film effects, multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept. Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over-the-top: \"When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff, I mean it felt like glam rock or something.\" \n\nThe video begins with a wide-angle shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold-colored horns protruding from each leg. The bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play. The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed; the band dancing around in a dimly lit setting; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror; the band members moving around with full makeup on; and the band members dancing frenziedly. Kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick, revealing mesh shorts and bright silver boots.\n\nDuring the backwards guitar solo, Frusciante was filmed waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's desire for the guitarist to do so, believing he would tell the director \"'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass, buddy' but [Frusciante] gladly went off and made love to the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have danced around for hours with that thing.\" The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes were planned with a storyboard, much of it was improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in what appears to be the daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.\n\nThe video—which cost an estimated $140,000 to produce—was completed while Kiedis and Frusciante were on a promotional trip through Europe in support of \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\". When the vocalist first saw it, he was \"more hysterically ecstatic about that piece of visual footage than anything [the band had] ever done.\" Warner Bros. executives, however, were worried that the content would be \"too weird\" or \"too artsy\" for the general public and favored a more traditional premise in contrast to the experimental approach Sednaoui took. The video was ultimately released without being edited by the record label; since then it has been widely credited as being a considerable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' success and greatly increased their international popularity. Journalist Jeff Apter noted the video's \"funky brew of goofy looks, a subtle invasive hook, Flea's spindly fingered baseline and Kiedis' crotch-hugging shorts made the clip essential viewing across MTV throughout the last few months of 1991.\" Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote in his review of the song that \"MTV jumped all over the visually distinctive video.\" Nominated for three awards—\"Best Alternative Video\", \"Breakthrough Video\", and \"Best Art Direction\"—at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, it won the latter two.\n\n\"Give It Away\" has been performed live by the band over 775 times, the most out of any of the band's songs and 29 years after its first performance; it remains a staple in the band's setlists, often closing the show. The band has performed the song on various talk shows and other events, including \"Saturday Night Live\" on March 6, 2006; as well as during the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show on February 2, 2014.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the most outstanding defiance of executive power regarding the war prior to 1971. The amendment was proposed by Senators George McGovern of South Dakota and Mark Hatfield of Oregon, and was known as the \"amendment to end the war.\"\n\nThe amendment was heavily opposed by the administration of President Richard Nixon. A revision of the amendment intended to gain more widespread support extended the deadline for withdrawal to the end of 1971. Nevertheless, the amendment was opposed by Nixon and his backers in the Congress, who argued that a withdrawal deadline would devastate the American position in negotiations with North Vietnam. On September 1, 1970, the amendment failed by a 55–39 margin.\n\nMinutes before the voting began, McGovern appealed for support with the strongest and most emotional language he had ever used regarding the war:\nAccording to historian Robert Mann, McGovern's brief, passionate speech shocked his Senate colleagues. As McGovern took his seat, most senators sat in stunned silence. \"You could have heard a pin drop,\" recalled John Holum, McGovern's principal staff advisor on Vietnam.

{"id": "2141418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141418", "title": "Mysterious Skin", "text": "Mysterious Skin\n\nMysterious Skin is a 2004 coming-of-age drama film directed by Gregg Araki, who also wrote the screenplay based on Scott Heim's 1995 novel of the same name. The film is Araki's eighth, premiering at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in 2004, although it was not more widely distributed until 2005.\n\n\"Mysterious Skin\" tells the story of two pre-adolescent boys who both experienced a strange event as children, and how it affects their lives in different ways into their young adulthood. One boy becomes a reckless, sexually adventurous male prostitute, while the other retreats into a reclusive fantasy of alien abduction.\n\nTwo eight-year-old Little League teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life-altering events during the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother who is already discovering his own homosexuality, is sexually abused by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of a house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours.\n\nNeil views the coach's abuse as love and becomes attracted to \"bearish\" middle-aged men. He begins prostituting himself at the age of 15, and continues doing so three years later when he moves to New York City, where his best friend, Wendy Peterson, now lives. In New York, Neil has an emotional encounter with a client, Zeke, who is dying from AIDS and (instead of sex) only wants to feel another person's touch. Afterwards, Neil begins withdrawing from prostitution and takes a job as a cashier with assistance and encouragement from Wendy.\n\nBrian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts, and bedwetting for years after entering the crawl space. He also has recurring dreams about being touched by a strange, bluish hand, which eventually lead Brian to suspect that he may have been abducted by aliens. Another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear in these dreams later on. At 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen who also believes that she was abducted by aliens. They start to form a friendship, but when she makes advances towards him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again.\n\nBrian sees a photo of his Little League team as he tries to untangle his confused memories, recognizing a young Neil as the other boy from his dreams. Meanwhile, after a john brutally rapes and beats him, Neil returns to Hutchinson to spend Christmas with his mother. There, Neil and Brian meet for the first time in over a decade. After breaking into the house that was previously rented by the Little League coach, Neil tells Brian what happened that night: the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil after a baseball game was rained out, as Brian did not have a ride. Instead, they all went to the coach's house, where the coach performed sex acts on the boys and made them perform sex acts on each other. At one point, Brian collapsed face-first onto the floor, giving him a bloody nose, while a nearby porch light caused the atmosphere to have an eerie blue color. Having finally learned the truth, Brian breaks down crying and is comforted by Neil as Christmas carolers sing “Silent Night\".\n\n\nBoth Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michelle Trachtenberg, by the time the film went into production, were looking for independent films where making money was not the main goal. Trachtenberg was filming \"EuroTrip\" (2004) in Prague when she first received the script, and quickly decided to join production. Gordon-Levitt was especially praiseful of Araki for allowing him to join production, and commented in a 2005 interview: \"It is a really different role for me, and I'll always be really grateful to Gregg for believing that I could do a role like this. I've played the nice kid, and the smart one or funny one and even the angry one, but Gregg was the first one to call me sexy, and I'll always be really grateful for that.\" Araki approached Gordon-Levitt, who was by then struggling to find work for over a year, after seeing him in \"Manic\" (2001). Made on a low budget, filming commenced in August 2003 and lasted only three weeks, which gave the cast and crew no possibility of doing retakes.\n\nA number of measures were taken to avoid exposing the child actors to the sexual and abusive aspects of the story. Although their parents were given the entire shooting script to review, the boys were given separate scripts which included only the activities they would be performing, and their roles and the characters' relationships were explained to them in innocent terms. All of the sexual abuse involving children is implied rather than being directly depicted, and the scenes in which this seduction and abuse takes place were filmed with each actor performing alone and addressing the camera rather than the other actor, then edited together, so the children did not see or hear the performance by the adult actor playing the abuser. (This subjective approach to filming was consequently used in various places throughout the film.)\n\n\"Mysterious Skin\" received very positive reviews. The film received an 85% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 108 reviews with an average rating of 7.31/10. The site's consensus states: \"Bold performances and sensitive, spot-on direction make watching this difficult tale of trauma and abuse a thought-provoking, resonant experience.\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 32 reviews.\n\nLou Lumenick from the \"New York Post\" commented, \"Not for the squeamish, but it is a beautifully crafted and thoughtful film that genuinely provokes.\" Ella Taylor from LA Weekly wrote “A warped, but beautiful and strangely hopeful, coming-of-age tale.” Roger Ebert gave \"Mysterious Skin\" 3.5 out of a possible 4 stars, describing it as \"at once the most harrowing and, strangely, the most touching film I have seen about child abuse\". Steven Rhea of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that \"Mysterious Skin\" ultimately \"manages to deal with its raw, awful subject matter in ways that are both challenging and illuminating\". Gordon-Levitt was praised by critics for his performance, and the actor has stated that people on the streets had come up to him to applaud his performance in the film. His portrayal of a teenage hustler inspired director Scott Frank to cast him in \"The Lookout\" (2007).\n\nAccording to psychologist Richard Gartner, the novel \"Mysterious Skin\" is an uncommonly accurate portrayal of the long-term effect of child sexual abuse on boys.\n\nThe US MPAA rated the film NC-17, which the studio appealed unsuccessfully. The film was released theatrically in the US without a rating.\n\nThe film was the subject of some controversy in Australia, where the Australian Family Association requested a review of its classification, seeking to have the film outlawed due to its depiction of pedophilia. They suggested that the film could be used by pedophiles for sexual gratification or to help them groom children for sexual abuse. The six-member Classification Review Board voted four-to-two in favour of maintaining an R18+ rating. The controversy is referenced in a review excerpt from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" on the Region 4 DVD that reads: \"How anyone could have wanted it banned is beyond me\"; film critic Margaret Pomeranz expressed that the film does more for the case against pedophilia, stating: \"People who do indulge in crimes like that, if they saw this film they would understand the damage that they do.\"\n\nThe film score was composed by Harold Budd and Robin Guthrie.\n\nOther songs include:\n\n\n"}

He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in \"Hear My Song\" (1991). He got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama series \"Cold Feet\" (1997–2003, 2016–present), which won him a British Comedy Award, a Television and Radio Industries Club Award, and a National Television Award.\n\nNesbitt's first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer \"Pig\" Finn in \"Waking Ned\" (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, he was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In \"Lucky Break\" (2001), he made his debut as a film lead, playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played Ivan Cooper in the television film \"Bloody Sunday\", about the 1972 shootings in Derry. A departure from his previous \"cheeky chappie\" roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a British Independent Film Award and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.\n\nNesbitt has also starred in \"Murphy's Law\" (2001–2007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy, a role that was created for him by writer Colin Bateman. The role twice gained Nesbitt Best Actor nominations at the Irish Film & Television Awards (IFTA). In 2007, he starred in the dual role of Tom Jackman and Mr Hyde in Steven Moffat's \"Jekyll\", which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination in 2008. Nesbitt has since appeared in several more dramatic roles; he starred alongside Liam Neeson in \"Five Minutes of Heaven\" (2009), and was one of three lead actors in the television miniseries \"Occupation\" (2009). He also starred in the movies \"Outcast\" (2010) and \"The Way\" (2010). He portrayed Bofur in \"The Hobbit\" film series (2012–2014). In 2014, Nesbitt starred as Tony Hughes in the acclaimed BBC One drama series \"The Missing\".\n\nWilliam James Nesbitt was born in Ballymena, County Antrim on 15 January 1965. His father, James \"Jim\" Nesbitt, was the headmaster of the primary school in Lisnamurrican (near Broughshane), while his mother, May Nesbitt, was a civil servant. He has three older sisters named Margaret, Kathryn, and Andrea, all of whom eventually became teachers. The family lived in the house adjoining the one-room school where Nesbitt was one of 32 pupils taught by his father, while the other pupils were all farmers' children. He grew up \"completely\" around women and spent a lot of time alone, \"kicking a ball against a wall\". He had ambitions to play football for Manchester United or to become a teacher like his father. His parents were Protestants, and Lisnamurrican was in \"Paisley country\". The family spent Sunday evenings singing hymns around the piano. Jim marched in the Ballymena Young Conquerors flute band and Nesbitt joined him playing the flute. After the Drumcree conflicts, they stopped marching with the band. The family's residence in the countryside left them largely unaffected by the Troubles, although Nesbitt, his father, and one of his sisters narrowly escaped a car bomb explosion outside Ballymena County Hall in the early 1970s.\n\nWhen Nesbitt was 11 years old, the family moved to Coleraine, County Londonderry, where May worked for the Housing Executive. He completed his primary education at Blagh primary school, then moved on to Coleraine Academical Institution (CAI). In 1978, when he was 13, his parents took him to audition for the Riverside Theatre's Christmas production of \"Oliver!\" Nesbitt sang \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" at the audition and won the part of the Artful Dodger in his acting debut. He continued to act and sing with Riverside until he was 16, and appeared at festivals and as an extra in \"Play For Today: The Cry\" (1984). He got his Equity card when the actor playing Jiminy Cricket in \"Pinocchio\" broke his ankle two days before the performance, and Nesbitt stepped in to take his place. Acting had not initially appealed to him, but he \"felt a light go on\" after he saw the film \"The Winslow Boy\" (1948). When he was 15, he got his first paid job as a bingo caller at Barry's Amusements in Portrush. He was paid £1 per hour for the summer job and would also, on occasions, work as the brake man on the big dipper attraction.\n\nNesbitt left CAI at the age of 18 and began a degree in French at Ulster Polytechnic (now Ulster University) in Jordanstown. He stayed for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, he said, \"I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football.\" He made the decision to quit one morning when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in \"Les Mains Sales\" at 4 a.m. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD). He felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background: \"When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out,' and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'\" He graduated in 1987, at the age of 22.\n\nThe day after leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt got a bit part in \"Virtuoso\", a BBC Two \"Screen Two\" television play about the life of John Ogdon. He worked for two days on the play, earning £250 per day. His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in \"Up on the Roof\". The musical ran at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, before transferring to the London West End. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in \"The Stage and Television Today\" wrote that Nesbitt \"steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment\". Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson's \"As You Like It\" at the Rose Theatre Club, and then appeared in Yuri Lyubimov's version of \"Hamlet\". \"Hamlet\" had been translated back to English from Boris Pasternak's Russian translation. It ran at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester for a month before a transfer to the Old Vic and then a nine-month world tour. Nesbitt played Guildenstern, Barnardo and the second gravedigger. He recalled that the play received \"shocking\" reviews, but was exciting.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he lived with fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the successful star of \"Soldier Soldier\". In his debut feature film, \"Hear My Song\" (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A \"New York Times\" critic wrote, \"the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor\". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, \"When I did \"Hear My Song\", I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are.\" His attitude left him out of work for six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of \"Boon\", \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", \"Covington Cross\", \"Lovejoy\", and \"Between the Lines\". In 1993, he appeared in \"Love Lies Bleeding\", an instalment of the BBC anthology series \"Screenplay\" and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in \"Go Now\" (1995), \"Jude\" (1996) and \"Welcome to Sarajevo\" (1997). A \"Guardian\" journalist wrote that \"he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor\" in \"Jude\" and \"Sarajevo\".\n\nBack on stage, he appeared as Doalty in \"Translations\" (Gwenda Hughes, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, 1991), Aidan in \"Una Pooka\" (Mark Lambert and Nicholas Kent, Tricycle Theatre, 1992), Damien in \"Paddywack\" (Michael Latimer) , Cockpit Theatre, 1994), and Jesus in \"Darwin's Flood\" (Simon Stokes, Bush Theatre, 1994). \"Paddywack\", in which Nesbitt's character is suspected by others of being an IRA member, transferred to the United States for a run at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in October 1994. A \"Variety\" critic called Damien \"the play's only fully developed character\" and commended Nesbitt for giving \"the one strong, telling performance [of the cast]\". In 1996, Nesbitt appeared in an episode of the BBC Northern Ireland television drama \"Ballykissangel\", playing Leo McGarvey, the ex-boyfriend of Assumpta Fitzgerald (Dervla Kirwan) and love rival of Peter Clifford (Stephen Tompkinson). He reprised the role for four episodes in 1998.\n\nIn 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, the male lead in \"Cold Feet\", an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in different stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in \"Hear My Song\" and \"Go Now\". Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt wanted to take the opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of \"Love Lies Bleeding\". \"Cold Feet\" was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. \"Cold Feet\"s first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. \n\nBy the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.\n\n\"Cold Feet\" ran for five years from 1998 to 2003, and Nesbitt won the British Comedy Award for Best TV Comedy Actor in 2000, the Television and Radio Industries Club Award for Drama TV Performer of the Year in 2002, the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Performance in 2003, and the TV Quick Award for Best Actor in 2003. Nesbitt credits the role with raising his profile with the public. Further television roles during these five years included women's football team coach John Dolan in the first two series of Kay Mellor's \"Playing the Field\" (appearing alongside his \"Cold Feet\" co-star John Thomson), investigative journalists Ryan and David Laney in \"Resurrection Man\" (Marc Evans, 1998) and \"Touching Evil II\" respectively, and womaniser Stanley in \"Women Talking Dirty\" (Coky Giedroyc, 1999).\n\nNesbitt's performance in \"Hear My Song\" had also impressed first-time screenwriter and film director Kirk Jones, who cast him in his 1998 feature film \"Waking Ned\". Playing amiable pig farmer \"Pig\" Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as \"Waking Ned Devine\"); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary \"Mad Dog\" Billy Wilson in \"The Most Fertile Man in Ireland\" (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, \"Wild About Harry\". Lowney had personally asked him to appear in the supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's \"Lucky Break\". He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, \"Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I thought it would be a little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels.\" The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.\n\nNesbitt had been approached at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who wanted him to star in a television drama he was making about the 1972 \"Bloody Sunday\" shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was \"no smoke without fire\" and that the Catholic marchers must have done something to provoke the British Army. He was filming \"Cold Feet\" in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had \"an extraordinary effect\" on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in \"Bloody Sunday\", the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's \"Eyewitness Bloody Sunday\" and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's \"Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?\". Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told \"The Observer\", \"For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing \"Lear\".\" Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.\n\nShortly before \"Bloody Sunday\" was broadcast, Nesbitt described it as \"difficult but extraordinary\" and \"emotionally draining\". The broadcast on ITV in January 2002 and its promotion did not pass without incident; he was criticised by Unionists for saying that Protestants in Northern Ireland felt \"a collective guilt\" over the killings. His parents' home was also vandalised and he received death threats. During the awards season, Nesbitt won the British Independent Film Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. The film was also screened at film festivals such as the Stockholm International Film Festival, where Nesbitt was presented with the Best Actor award.\n\nIn an analysis of the film in the \"History & Memory\" journal, Aileen Blaney wrote that it is Nesbitt's real-life household name status that made his portrayal of Cooper such a success. She reasoned that Nesbitt's celebrity status mirrors that of Cooper's in the 1970s: \"A household name across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic [sic], Nesbitt's widespread popular appeal is emphatically not contingent upon his Protestant Ulster identity, and consequently the double-voicing of the character he plays does not alienate viewers of an alternative, or no, sectarian persuasion.\" \"Guardian\" journalist Susie Steiner suggested that his appearance in \"Bloody Sunday\" was an attempt to resolve the expression of his \"Irishness\" on screen: \"Where he has taken part in a sectarian theme, his intelligence as an actor has often been masked by an excessive, cartoon-style comedy. Yet in his more successful, high-profile roles, (notably in \"Cold Feet\", and as Pig Finn in the gently pastoral film \"Waking Ned\"), Nesbitt's Irishness has been exploited for its romantic charm. It has been sugared and, in the process, de-politicised.\" A critic identified \"Bloody Sunday\" as Nesbitt's \"coming of age\" film, and Nesbitt called it a turning point in his career. He refers to his career since the film was released as \"post-\"Bloody Sunday\"\".\n\nIn 2003, Nesbitt played undercover police detective Tommy Murphy in the first series of \"Murphy's Law\", after starring in a successful pilot episode in 2001. The series was conceived when Nesbitt was working on \"Playing the Field\"; he and producer Greg Brenman approached author Colin Bateman about creating a television series for Nesbitt in a similar vein to Bateman's Dan Starkey novels. Bateman and Nesbitt were already well acquainted; Nesbitt had been considered for a main role in \"Divorcing Jack\" (David Caffrey, 1998), based on Bateman's original novel. A 90-minute pilot of \"Murphy's Law\" was commissioned by the BBC, initially as a \"comedy action adventure\". Bateman created a complex backstory for Murphy, which was cut at the request of the producers. After the broadcast of the pilot, \"Guardian\" critic Gareth McLean wrote, \"the likeable James Nesbitt turned in a strong, extremely watchable central performance, though rarely did he look taxed by his efforts, and his chemistry with [Claudia] Harrison was promising and occasionally electric.\" In 2003, Nesbitt won the Irish Film & Television Award (IFTA) for Best Actor in a TV Drama for the role. The second series was broadcast in 2004.\n\nBy 2005, Nesbitt had become tired of the formula and threatened to quit unless the structure of the series was changed. He was made a creative consultant and suggested that Murphy keep one undercover role for a full series, instead of changing into a new guise every episode. This new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real-life undercover work. Alongside his research with former undercover officer Peter Bleksley, Nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a handlebar moustache to change Murphy's physical characteristics and tone down the \"cheeky chappie\" persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles. With his trainer, he worked out three times a week, boxing and doing circuits and weights. After the first new episode was broadcast, Sarah Vine wrote in \"The Times\", \"In the past, when attempting a nasty stare or a hard face, Nesbitt has never managed much more than a faintly quizzical look, hilarity forever threatening to break out behind those twinkly Irish eyes. But here, it's different. He genuinely has the air of a man who means business.\" The refreshed series marked another milestone in Nesbitt's career; he describes it as \"a big moment\" in his life. \"Murphy's Law\" was not recommissioned for a sixth series, which Nesbitt attributed to the damage done to the fifth series ratings when it was scheduled opposite the popular ITV drama \"Doc Martin\".\n\nIn 2004, Nesbitt appeared in \"Wall of Silence\", a fact-based drama about the aftermath of the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed \"Bloody Sunday\" when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.\n\nIn March 2004, he appeared in Tony Marchant's \"Passer By\", playing Joe Keyes, a man who witnesses a woman being accosted by some men on a train and chooses not to help. Keyes later discovers that the woman was raped but cannot bring himself to admit in court that he did nothing to help her. Nesbitt described Keyes as \"like a better man than me: a good father and husband. But, once he has made a wrong decision, he can't control everything in his life, as he thinks he is weak. He loses the respect of his wife, his son and at work, and has to reach the lowest possible point before finding redemption.\" As a result of these serious roles, he was named the sixth most powerful figure in TV drama in a listing compiled by industry experts for the \"Radio Times\". In September 2004, he starred as Jack Parlabane in the ITV adaptation of Christopher Brookmyre's \"Quite Ugly One Morning\". The producers originally wanted Scottish actor Douglas Henshall to play Glaswegian Parlabane but ITV executives overruled them and cast Nesbitt. He was given coaching to perfect the accent but it was soon discarded on the advice of both the director and his co-star Daniela Nardini. Also in 2004, he filmed the roles of Ronnie Cunningham in \"Millions\" (Danny Boyle, 2004), and Detective Banner in \"Match Point\" (Woody Allen, 2005). He was considering taking time off from acting and did not really want the role in \"Match Point\". He sent in an audition tape and was accepted for the part. Nesbitt's character appears at the end of the film and he read only that part of the script, so did not know the full circumstances of the crime Banner investigates. Despite his initial reluctance, Nesbitt enjoyed working with Allen, and complimented him on his directing style.\n\nNesbitt returned to theatre acting in June 2005 when he appeared in David Nicholls' \"After Sun\", a ten-minute-play performed as part of the Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's \"Shoot the Crow\". He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In \"The Independent\", Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: \"Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves.\" In \"The Daily Telegraph\", Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as \"outstanding\".\n\nAt the end of 2005, Nesbitt and his agent met with BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter to discuss a new series of \"Murphy's Law\". At the meeting's conclusion, Tranter offered Nesbitt the first episode script of \"Jekyll\", a television series by Steven Moffat that updated \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". Nesbitt spent three hours reading the script before accepting the role of Tom Jackman—and his alter-ego Mr Hyde. After signing on for the role, he met with Moffat and Hartswood Films executive producer Beryl Vertue to discuss the character, and had several make-up tests. His anticipation for the part was heightened because filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006. Nesbitt spent an hour each day being made up as Hyde; a wig altered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde \"soulless\", though CGI was used to show the transformation from Jackman in close-ups. The series was broadcast on BBC One in June and July 2007. The role secured him a nomination from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, and a nomination for the Rose d'Or for Best Entertainer.\n\nIn 2008, he portrayed Pontius Pilate in \"The Passion\", a BBC/HBO adaptation of the last week in the life of Jesus. He had originally rejected the script due to other filming commitments, but accepted the role after his agent told him to re-read it before making a final decision. He was pleased to learn that the serial was being produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark, whose \"Bleak House\" adaptation he had enjoyed, and that he would be appearing with his \"Jekyll\" co-star Denis Lawson. Contrary to previous portrayals of Pilate, Nesbitt played the biblical figure as \"nice\", and—as when playing Jack Parlabane—used his own accent. The serial was broadcast in the UK during Easter week 2008. Shortly after filming \"The Passion\", he filmed the part of journalist Max Raban in the Carnival Films thriller \"Midnight Man\", which was shown on ITV in May 2008. It won him a joint nomination (along with the 2007 series of \"Murphy's Law\") for the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for Best Actor. At the end of the year, he had a starring role in the low-budget independent film \"Blessed\". The writer and director Mark Aldridge scripted the character of Peter with Nesbitt in mind to play him. The film had a limited release throughout 2008 and 2009 before the BBC screened it on television in 2010. Nesbitt said, \"The role of Peter is what I have dreamed about playing, you wait your whole life for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it.\"\n\nThe following year, Nesbitt co-starred with Liam Neeson in the fact-based television film \"Five Minutes of Heaven\" (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2009). The first part of the film dramatises the real-life murder of Jim Griffin by Alistair Little in 1970s Lurgan; the second part features a fictional meeting between Little (Neeson) and Jim's brother Joe (Nesbitt) 33 years later. Nesbitt met with Griffin before filming began to learn about how his brother's murder affected him. The film was broadcast on BBC Two in April 2009. He also starred as Colour Sgt. Mike Swift in Peter Bowker's three-part BBC/Kudos television serial \"Occupation\". In \"Occupation\", set over six years, Nesbitt's character is one of three British soldiers who return to Basra, Iraq after their tours have concluded. He researched the role by speaking to Territorial Army soldiers in Belfast, and RAF officers in Morocco, where the serial was filmed. Both performances were commended by \"Independent\" journalist Hugh Montgomery; in a review of 2009's television, Montgomery named Nesbitt \"Face of the Year\", writing, \"Just as you had James Nesbitt written off as the gurning embodiment of everything mediocre about British TV drama, he produced two stonking performances, as the transfixingly harrowed sergeant in \"Occupation\", and a nervily vengeful victim's relative in Irish-troubles piece \"Five Minutes of Heaven\". Give the man a Bafta.\" Nesbitt was not nominated for a BAFTA award, though did receive a nomination for Best Actor from the Broadcasting Press Guild for both performances.\n\nIn March 2009, Nesbitt signed a contract with the American talent agency United Talent Agency, as the global financial crisis was restricting roles in British television. He continued to be represented in the United Kingdom by Artists Rights Group. The next year Nesbitt played the hunter Cathal in the low-budget British horror film \"Outcast\", which was a departure from his previous character types. After screening at major international film festivals in early 2010, the film had a general release in the latter part of the year. Nesbitt had previously worked with the film's director and co-writer Colm McCarthy on \"Murphy's Law\", which was one reason he took the role. He researched the mythical aspects of the character by reading about Irish folklore and beliefs. He also starred alongside Minnie Driver and his \"Welcome to Sarajevo\" co-star Goran Višnjić in the Tiger Aspect television serial \"The Deep\". In the five-part drama, Nesbitt played submarine engineer Clem Donnelly. The serial was filmed over 12 weeks at BBC Scotland's studios in Dumbarton. August 2010 saw the release of Nadia Tass's film \"Matching Jack\", in which Nesbitt plays the leading role of Connor. He became involved in the film after reading an early script draft in 2006. In 2008, the global financial crisis severely reduced the budget of the film, and Nesbitt volunteered a reduction in his salary so the film could still be made. The film was shot over eight weeks in Melbourne in 2009 and released in 2010.\n\nNext, Nesbitt reunited with \"Occupation\" screenwriter Peter Bowker to star in the ITV medical drama series \"Monroe\", playing Gabriel Monroe. Nesbitt was Bowker's first choice for the part. Nesbitt researched the role of the neurosurgeon character by watching brain surgery being performed by Henry Marsh, and by consulting Philip Van Hille at Leeds General Infirmary. The series was filmed over 12 weeks in Leeds at the end of 2010 and broadcast on ITV during March and April 2011. Nesbitt will reprise the role in a second series, which is due to begin production in 2012. In film, Nesbitt co-stars as Irish writer Jack in Emilio Estevez's drama \"The Way\", alongside Martin Sheen, Deborah Kara Unger, and Yorick van Wageningen, and has a role as Sicinius in Ralph Fiennes' contemporary Shakespeare adaptation \"Coriolanus\".\n\nAlongside many other British and Irish actors, Nesbitt was cast in Peter Jackson's three-part film \"The Hobbit\", as the dwarf Bofur. Filming commenced in March 2011. The first part, \"\", was released in December 2012, the second part, \"\", in December 2013, and the third and final part, \"\", in December 2014.\n\nIn 2002, Nesbitt made his documentary debut as the presenter of \"James Nesbitt's Blazing Saddles\", a production for BBC Choice that saw him spend two weeks in Las Vegas at the National Finals Rodeo and the Miss Rodeo America pageant. In 2007, he was the guest host of an episode of the late-night Channel 4 comedy \"The Friday Night Project\". As a film awards presenter, he hosted the IFTA Awards ceremony for three consecutive years between 2005 and 2007, the British Independent Film Awards from 2005 to 2010, and the National Movie Awards in 2008 and 2010. In 2009, he hosted the Laurence Olivier Awards.\n\nAn amateur golfer since his teenage years, Nesbitt joined the European team for Sky One's \"All*Star Cup\" in 2005 and 2006. He signed up to a series of high-profile television advertisements for the Yell Group in 2003, playing a hapless character called James for the company's Yellow Pages campaign until 2006. \"Times\" writer Andrew Billen noted that the adverts \"cost him some credibility\" but Nesbitt was pleased with the money he made from them. In 2004, he joined the supergroup Twisted X to produce \"Born in England\", an unofficial anthem for the England national football team's entry in the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament. His vocals have also appeared in \"Lucky Break\" and an episode of \"Cold Feet\". The song he performed in the latter—\"(Love Is) The Tender Trap\"—was released on one of the series' soundtrack albums. He also contributed vocals to the \"Waking Ned\" soundtrack. A fan of Northern Irish band Ash, he made a cameo in their unreleased film \"Slashed\". In 2009, he starred in the music video for \"The Day I Died\", a single by English dance-pop artist Just Jack. Nesbitt was recommended to Just Jack by Elton John. Nesbitt hosted the 2013 British Independent Film Awards in London on 8 December 2013.\n\nSince 2013, Nesbitt appears in adverts for Thomas Cook.\n\nIn 2014, Nesbitt had the lead role as the father character Tony Hughes in harrowing BBC drama series \"The Missing\", alongside Frances O'Connor (as his wife/ex-wife, Emily Hughes/Walsh) and Tchéky Karyo (as Julien Baptiste, leading French police investigator). The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers as to what happened to their son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film \"The Way\" (2010).\n\nNesbitt was married to Sonia Forbes-Adam, the daughter of the Reverend Sir Timothy Forbes Adam. The two met when Nesbitt went to the final call-back for \"Hamlet\" at Loughborough Hall in 1989, and they soon began dating. They split up for a year after the release of \"Hear My Song\" but reunited and married in 1994. They had two daughters, Peggy and Mary, both of whom appeared in the final two \"Hobbit\" movies as the daughters of Bard the Bowman. In October 2013, Nesbitt announced that he and his wife would separate after 19 years. They were divorced in 2016.\n\nNesbitt is a patron of Wave, a charity set up to support those traumatised by the Troubles. The charity faced closure due to funding problems before Nesbitt encouraged celebrities and artists to become involved. Since 2005, he has been a UNICEF UK ambassador, working with HIV and AIDS sufferers, and former child soldiers in Africa. He describes the role as \"a privilege.\" Writing in \"The Independent\" about his visit to Zambia in 2006, Nesbitt concluded that the children he met were owed a social and moral responsibility. The article was described in the \"Evening Standard\" as \"moving and notably well-crafted.\" Since 1999, he has been a patron of Action Cancer, a result of both his father's affliction with prostate cancer and a storyline in the second series of \"Cold Feet\", where his character suffered testicular cancer. He has been an honorary patron of Youth Lyric, one of Ireland's largest theatre schools, since 2007.\n\nNesbitt is a fan of football teams Coleraine FC and, most passionately, Manchester United FC. He also supports the Northern Irish national football team. In 2003, he made a donation of \"thousands of pounds\" to Coleraine after the team came close to bankruptcy. He has called the team \"a heartbeat\" of Coleraine and encouraged more people to watch Irish League football. Nesbitt was a vocal opponent of Malcolm Glazer's 2005 takeover of Manchester United; however, after the completion of the deal, he acted in television advertisements promoting executive boxes at Old Trafford and was criticised by fans. To counter the criticism, he pledged half of his £10,000 fee to the Manchester United Supporters' Trust and the other half to UNICEF.\n\nIn March 2010, Nesbitt accepted the ceremonial position of Chancellor of Ulster University, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair of the university ruling council, expected Nesbitt to \"bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment\" to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, \"Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to an awful lot of people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on.\"\n\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to drama and to the community in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n"}

It is owned by Univision Communications. From its original licensing on March 13, 1925 until 1955 it was called KFVD. The station has studios on the Univision Broadcast Center building located on 5999 Center Drive (near I-405) in West Los Angeles, and the transmitter is located in the City of Industry.\n\nIn its early years, between January 3, 1929 and December 31, 1931, KFVD broadcast from offices and towers on the Hal Roach Studios' lot.. From 1937 to 1939, Woody Guthrie broadcast regular shows from the station, then run by Frank Burke Sr. and his son Frank Burke Jr. First he accompanied his Cousin Leon \"Oklahoma Jack\" Guthrie, later with Maxine \"Lefty Lou\" Chrissman. The \"Woody and Lefty Lou\"-Show soon became the most popular on the station. When Chrissman resigned due to health reasons, Guthrie continued for another year as \"The Lone Wolf\" until he was sacked for his unrelenting support for the Soviet Union even after they invaded Poland.\n\nFrom August 1, 1955 until 1960 it was called KPOP. From June 29, 1960 until 1976, it was called KGBS. On September 27, 1976 the station's call sign was changed to the current KTNQ, originally billed as \"The New Ten Q.\"\n\nDuring the late 1970s along with competitor stations such as KHJ (AM) and San Diego-based XETRA-AM (\"The Mighty 690\"), the station specialized in Top 40 music, and was broadcast in English. The radio station figures prominently in the Ron Howard film \"Grand Theft Auto\". where disc jockey \"The Real\" Don Steele is doing a live broadcast from a helicopter with the station's call sign following two star-crossed lovers. KTNQ would later change languages to Spanish in the 1980s.\n\nKTNQ was a part of the Univision America Talk Radio network as of July 4, 2012. While the network itself ceased operations in 2015, KTNQ aired the remnants of Univision America's programming as well as local news, weather, and sports.\n\nKTNQ has been the Spanish language flagship station of the Los Angeles Dodgers since 2011. It also broadcast Dodger games from 1979 to 1986.\n\nOn December 20, 2016, Univision announced that KTNQ would be one of the charter affiliates of Univision Deportes Radio, their new Spanish-language sports network launched in April 2017. It continued to broadcast the network upon its June 20, 2019 rebrand to TUDN Radio. In September 2019, KTNQ returned to a locally-programmed Spanish-language news/talk format, after KWKW took on the TUDN Radio affiliation following the shutdown of the competing ESPN Deportes Radio network.\n\n"}
{"id": "2141447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141447", "title": "Clube dos 13", "text": "Clube dos 13\n\nClube dos 13 (Club of the 13) was the organization responsible for representing the interest of the most powerful football clubs of Brazil, including members from several football state federations such as Federação Paulista de Futebol, Federação de Futebol do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Federação Gaúcha de Futebol and Federação Mineira de Futebol .\nThe organization exists mainly to negotiate radio and television rights of competitions such as the Campeonato Brasileiro. Also Clube dos 13 is responsible for providing a unified voice in negotiations with CBF about the format of the Brazilian competitions.\n\nIt was founded on July 11, 1987, by representatives of the 13 most traditional clubs, hence the organization's name. As of 2007, the organization is now composed of 20 members.\n\nClube dos 13 organized two national competitions: 1987 Copa União and 2000 Copa João Havelange.\n\nThe Clube dos 13 teams were dissatisfied with CBF, and so they organized their own championship independently of the CBF. Copa União was contested between sixteen teams: the thirteen founding members of Clube dos 13 and three invited teams (Coritiba, Goiás and Santa Cruz).\n\nThe first phase of Copa União was divided in two stages, and the teams were divided in two groups of eight teams (Group A and Group B). Both stages were played in a single round-robin format. In the first stage the teams from one group played against the teams of the other group. In the second stage, the teams played inside their own groups. The winners of the two groups from both stages qualified to the semifinal phase. The semi-finals and the finals were played in two legs.\n\nThe competition was not initially recognized by CBF, and the winners were not officially credited as national champions. CBF invited the winner and runner-up of Copa União, Flamengo and Internacional, respectively to play against CBF's competition winner and runner-up (Sport Recife and Guarani), but the proposal was refused. So, CBF did not recognize Flamengo and Internacional as champions and runners-up and neither did it invite them to play Copa Libertadores. \n\nAfter unsuccessful attempts were made by Flamengo to obtain recognition in sport tribunals as national champion for the year 1987, a common justice civil suit was filed before the Brazilian Federal Judiciary, and this suit was judged in favor of Sport Recife, that thus obtained a judicial declaration that it was the 1987 National Champion.\nAfterwards, CBF long held that it could not review the matter, either by removing the title from Sport Recife and awarding it to Flamengo, or even by splitting the 1987 title between the two clubs, by declaring both Flamengo and Sport as 1987 champions, because it was prevented from so doing by the result of the civil suit that declared Sport National Champions. This suit ended after all the possibilities of appeal were extinguished, and the decision in favor of Sport Recife became res judicata.\n\nIn 2011, however, amid internal CBF political disputes, Flamengo persuaded the presidency of CBF to take a different view. Flamengo now argued that the judicial decision in favor of Sport had a narrower scope: it directed that Sport Recife be recognized as the 1987 champions, but, according to this view now presented, it did not preclude CBF from also recognizing Flamengo as champions. Thus, Flamengo argued that CBF still could split the title between the two clubs if it wanted to. The CBF legal consultants agreed with this view, and the presidency of CBF then finally agreed to recognize both Flamengo and Sport as 1987 champions. Accordingly, on February 21, 2011, CBF issued a declaration recognizing Flamengo as 1987 national champions, along with Sport Recife. Sport Recife, however, took the matter to court once more: it argued before the Federal Court that had passed judgement in the 1980s that its ruling was now being breached by CBF. \n\nSport Recife managed to persuade the federal judge that the earlier judicial ruling declaring it as the 1987 champion prevented CBF from diminishing its title in any way, and that accordingly CBF could not recognize Flamengo or any other team as champions, or even joint champions. The federal judge thus issued an injunction, that is currently in force and that was upheld by the regional federal appeals court, declaring Sport as the sole 1987 National Champions, and ordering CBF to recant its February 21, 2011 declaration. CBF complied with the judicial order and, on June 14, 2011, it issued a new declaration, that revoked the February declaration that had recognized Flamengo as joint champions, and proclaimed the recognition of Sport Recife as sole 1987 National champions. CBF further declared that it was doing so only to comply with the judicial order, and that it still believed that its actions had not breached the earlier ruling.\n\nThe 2000 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A was organized by the Clube dos 13, and CBF ratified it. The competition did not obey the promotion and relegation rules of 1999 Campeonato Brasileiro. The championship was created because Gama, in the 1999 championship contested and won in a common justice court and reverted its relegation. After Gama withdrew its protests in the common justice, the team was included in the championship.\n\nThe championship's first phase was divided in four modules (Blue, Yellow, Green and White), based on the popularity and tradition of the 114 participating teams. To the final phase, the 12 better placed teams of the Blue module, 3 from the Yellow module and 1 qualified from the Green and White playoffs played the round of 16. The next round was the Quarterfinals, them the semifinals and the finals, played by São Caetano and Vasco da Gama. The competition was won by Vasco da Gama.\n\nThe competition was named after former FIFA president João Havelange.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense and Vasco announced that they would no longer negotiate television rights through Clube dos 13. Meanwhile, Corinthians announced it left Clube dos 13. Both decisions were related to a disagreement regarding the television rights proposed by Clube dos 13. The five clubs will negotiate the television rights for the 2012-2014 seasons with no mediation by Clube dos 13.\n\n"}

The hospital opened on November 15, 1931 with 20 beds. The hospital closed in 1935 when the dam was finished. It was not until 1943 when the hospital reopened. The old hospital building, currently called The Life-Giving Spring Retreat Center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was abandoned when a new building for the hospital opened on December 8, 1973, a mile away to the southwest at the intersection of Adams Boulevard and Buchanan Boulevard, on the southeast corner.\n\nBy Dennis McBride:\n\nBoulder City's first hospital was built by the Six Companies, the group responsible for building Hoover Dam. The U.S. Public Health Service, the government agency that would have been responsible for maintaining health in the dam town, couldn't afford to build a hospital. A second government agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, felt since the majority of workers on the project were employed by Six Companies, it was the companies’ responsibility to build and maintain a hospital. The government worked out an arrangement by which Bureau employees could also use the hospital.\n\nThe hospital site was the top of Block 8, a hill on the northeast side of town originally reserved for a resort hotel. The view from the hospital was magnificent: the Eldorado Valley and McCullough Mountains to the south, and to the north the Colorado River wound lazily through its bed. Construction began in August 1931 and the hospital was opened November 15, 1931. The cost of the original Boulder City Hospital was $20,000.\n\nThe hospital was built of brick and white stucco, and the L-shaped building housed 20 beds and a special orthopedic ward. The Pest House, an eight-bed isolation facility for contagious diseases, was maintained away from the main hospital building. In 1933, a wing was added to the hospital as an isolation ward and the Pest House was torn down.\n\nSix Companies employees were charged $1.50 per month health fee through payroll deduction which entitled them, but not their families, to services at Boulder City Hospital. Family members of the dam workers were forced to travel to Las Vegas for care.\n\nWhen the dam was finished in 1935 and the Six Companies left Boulder, the hospital was closed. Those needing medical care went to Las Vegas. In some emergency cases, the time to travel into town proved fatal. In 1938, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for the hospital building and turned it into a museum and office. The Park Service left the building in 1941 and the building remained vacant for two years.\n\nIn December 1943, the U.S. Public Health Service reopened the hospital to care for war wounded. While the Bureau of Reclamation wanted to build a new hospital and had the money, building materials were unavailable. The Bureau simply remodeled the old hospital and signed a memorandum of agreement with the Health Service, providers of refurbished equipment to the hospital. Town residents cleaned and repaired the second-hand x-ray machines, sterilizers, beds and other items that came from hospitals around the country.\n\nTown residents also donated money for an ambulance and organized a volunteer ambulance corps. Subscription to this service was $15 per year. Membership entitled the bearer to one ride to the hospital.\n\nIn 1949 the Bureau of Reclamation took control of the hospital which continuously lost money. The hospital served the city well enough but it proved to be a financial drain on the government. In 1954, with no forewarning, the Bureau dumped the hospital. If Boulder City wanted a hospital, it had to raise $15,000 in two weeks to cover operating expenses and maintenance. The townspeople rallied and began a door-to-door fundraising campaign called ‘Save the Hospital’ on February 25, 1954. By March 18 the fund surpassed $15,000 and the hospital was turned over to citizen control on April 15, 1954.\n\nThe Boulder City Hospital Auxiliary was formed by local women to help with hospital work and to raise money to finance operation of the hospital. A fund raising effort begun in 1963 by the Auxiliary has become a Boulder institution. This was the Boulder City Hospital Auxiliary art festival, Art in the Park. The first festival brought in $3,000 and involved fifty artists, including James Swinnerton.\n\nOn December 8, 1973, a new Boulder City Hospital located on Adams Boulevard opened its doors. The old Six Companies Hospital on the hill fell into disrepair and was condemned. The Sisters of Charity bought the building in 1976 and began renovation in 1980, turning the hospital into a retreat house known as Wellspring. The building was dedicated on April 5, 1981 and a year later was listed on the National Register of Historic Places\n\nBoulder City Hospital is available to provide out-patient services. The following Out-Patient Services are available at Boulder City Hospital with an order from the patient's physician:\n"}

Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 (1972), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court dismissed for lack of ripeness a claim in which the plaintiff accused the U.S. Army of alleged unlawful \"surveillance of lawful citizen political activity.\" The appellant's specific nature of the harm caused by the surveillance was that it chilled the First Amendment rights of all citizens and undermined that right to express political dissent.\n\nArlo Tatum, the executive secretary of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, sued Melvin Laird, the Secretary of Defense. Tatum sued after \"Washington Monthly\" published an article revealing that US military intelligence units were gathering intelligence on civilians and civil organizations in the US.\n\nThe Court was initially divided into three camps. Justices Rehnquist and Powell initially urged the conservatives to determine that the surveillance program was constitutional. However, Chief Justice Burger, and Justices Blackmun and White determined that it would be more controversial for the Court to enter into a political question.\" After further reflection Powell concluded that it was unwise to rule on the constitutionality of the surveillance program and that the issue was best decided on the principle of ripeness. That is, in the absence of a discernable injury, the issue was too speculative for the Court to rule upon. Burger eventually prevailed on Rehnquist to abandon a concurrence and join with the majority.\n\nThe Court determined that the plaintiff's claim was based on the fear that sometime in the future the Army might cause harm with information retrieved during their surveillance, but that there was no present threat. Therefore, the claim was too \"speculative.\"\n\nMr. Justice Douglas wrote in dissent, with Mr. Justice Marshall concurring:\nThe dismissal of the case was made possible by the timely nomination by Richard Nixon of Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist to the Supreme Court. Rehnquist had previously testified to Senator Sam Ervin's committee that there were no \"serious constitutional problems with respect to collecting data or keeping under surveillance persons who are merely exercising their right of a peaceful assembly or petition to redress a grievance.\" He further stated that he felt that \"Laird v. Tatum\" should be dismissed on the procedural ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. Yet he later refused to recuse himself from the case as legal ethicists almost unanimously agreed that he should. After a petition for rehearing was filed based on his participation, Rehnquist issued a memorandum stating that the attack on his impartiality was essentially a criticism of his conservative judicial philosophy, and there had been no actual bias towards the litigant.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2141555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141555", "title": "National Railway", "text": "National Railway\n\nThe National Railway or National Air Line Railroad was a planned railroad between New York City and Washington, D.C. in the United States around 1870. Part of it was eventually built from New York to Philadelphia by the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad and the Delaware River Branch of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, leased by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway in 1879 and becoming its New York Branch. The line was intended to provide an alternate to the various monopolies that existed along the route, specifically the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Companies and their Camden and Amboy Railroad, and as such had a long struggle to be built.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, Henry Martyn Hamilton began planning for the National Railway between New York and Philadelphia by getting short lines chartered that would end-to-end form the complete route. The first two sections were chartered in New Jersey as the Hamilton Land Improvement Company and Millstone and Trenton Railroad, forming half of the New Jersey route. The Millstone and Trenton Railroad was authorized to build a line from Trenton northeast to Millstone, and the Hamilton Land Improvement Company could build six miles anywhere in the state, which was enough to bridge the gap from Millstone to the Central Railroad of New Jersey at Bound Brook.\n\nThe first official proposals for the railway came in 1868 at the federal level, with bills in the U.S. House of Representatives for a line between New York and Washington via Easton, Reading and Lancaster. Later proposals concentrated on the New York-Philadelphia section, and were made both at the federal level and in the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nOn September 21, 1868, the Attleborough Railroad, a short branch line chartered April 15, 1856 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was taken over by Hamilton and renamed to the National Railway, to be part of the through line. The project was first publicized in December of that year.\n\nOn January 1, 1869 the Camden and Amboy Rail Road's (C&A) legislated monopoly over New York-Philadelphia railroads in New Jersey expired. However, the C&A continued to lobby legislators and fight through the courts to prevent the National Railway from being built. In 1870 various bills in New Jersey to allow consolidation of short lines into the Millstone and Trenton Railroad failed.\n\nIn early 1871 the National Railway bill was introduced once again in the U.S. House, this time by John W. Garrett (president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), who feared the Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) proposed lease of the United Companies. It was again defeated. The PRR gained control of the United Companies on May 15, 1871.\n\nOn March 30, 1871, the German Valley Railroad was chartered in New Jersey, including a Trojan Horse for the National Railway. The governor refused to sign the bill, but the company organized anyway. The same strategy was used on March 19, 1872 with the passage of the Stanhope Railroad. The state clerks were bribed to keep the Trojan Horse off the debated version but include it in the signed version. This was soon discovered, and on August 12 the National Railway was sued for fraud. On February 2, 1873 the New Jersey Court of Chancery ruled that the National Railway had no rights to build in New Jersey.\n\nOn January 11, 1873 the Excelsior Enterprise Company, a holding company incorporated on May 24, 1871, was renamed the National Company, acquiring the National Railway of Pennsylvania (the original Attleborough Railroad) on January 15. The National Railway gained control of the Stanhope Railroad on January 18, but that soon proved worthless.\n\nOn March 19, 1873 the New Jersey House of Representatives killed the PRR's opposition bill to create a New Jersey Railway on the land chosen for the National Railway. The PRR and National Railway agreed at that time to support a general incorporation law to break the stalemate, which had been blocked since the 1840s by the Camden and Amboy. That law was passed on April 2, and on April 8 the PRR's company was chartered, running mostly within 100 yards of the planned National Railway. The National Railway of New Jersey was chartered soon after on April 17, as a supplement to the New York and Philadelphia Railroad, chartered 40 minutes after the general incorporation law was passed. Investors were initially scared off from the project, placed under contract on May 31, due to the various scandals involved.\n\nThe Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad was incorporated in New Jersey on May 12, 1874, to build a railroad from the Delaware River to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) at Bound Brook, along the National Railway's surveyed path. At that time, the North Pennsylvania Railroad took over the National Railway project from Hamilton. On May 14 the North Pennsylvania approved the construction of the Delaware River Branch, splitting from the main line at Jenkintown and running to the Delaware River at Yardley. On May 16 the property of the National Railway was deeded to the D&BB, including the Stanhope Railroad and the National Company.\n\nThe Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad (D&BB) and Delaware River Branch opened on May 1, 1876, from the North Pennsylvania Railroad to the CNJ. The D&BB had trackage rights over the CNJ to their Jersey City terminal. The Trenton Branch of the D&BB opened in 1877.\n\nThe original plans carried the National Railway northeast and east past Bound Brook, running north of the CNJ and crossing the New Jersey Rail Road at Waverly to the CNJ terminal. In Pennsylvania, the original plan was southeast of what was built, running directly to the north end of the Junction Railroad in Philadelphia. Part of this route was built in the mid-1900s (decade) as the New York Short Line Railroad, connecting the original Delaware River Branch at Oakford southwest to the Reading's Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad (PN&NY) at Cheltenham.\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railway leased the North Pennsylvania Railroad, including the D&BB, on May 14, 1879. The National Company's charter was later used to form the Reading Company, a holding company for the Reading system.\n\nThe East Trenton Railroad, incorporated in 1884, was taken over by the D&BB as a branch in the Trenton area. The Trenton, Lawrenceville and Princeton Railroad, an interurban streetcar line, was taken over at some point as a branch of the East Trenton Railroad for freight. The Port Reading Railroad, opened in 1892, also served as a spur of the D&BB, running to Port Reading on the Arthur Kill.\n\nThe United Companies received a charter for the Mercer and Somerset Railway in New Jersey on March 17, 1870 solely to provide a challenge to the planned competitor railroad known as the National Railway. Track began to be laid on January 20, 1871 at the crossing of the National Railway survey in Hopewell. A frog war resulted in early 1876 at the crossing point; a war that was won by the National Railway, thus rendering the Mercer and Somerset Railway redundant and useless. In 1879 or 1880 the Mercer and Somerset Railway was abandoned, having become useless.\n\nOn October 22, 1873 the PRR leased the PN&NY, a railroad chartered on November 21, 1860, with the intention to block the National Railway. The line opened as a branch of the Connecting Railroad to Newtown on February 2, 1878, and on November 22, 1879 the North Pennsylvania Railroad began operating it, no longer of use to the PRR. Another challenge was raised as to whether the company could build a bridge over the Delaware River.\n\n\n"}

The museum was founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, who also founded the open-air museum Skansen. For long part of the museum, the institutions were made independent of each other in 1963.\n\nThe museum was originally (1873) called the Scandinavian Ethnographic Collection (\"Skandinavisk-etnografiska samlingen\"), from 1880 the Nordic Museum (\"Nordiska Museum\", now \"Nordiska museet\"). When Hazelius established the open-air museum Skansen in 1891, it was the second such museum in the world. \n\nFor the museum, Hazelius bought or got donations of objects like furniture, clothes and toys from all over Sweden and the other Nordic countries; he emphasised the peasant culture, but his successors increasingly started to collect objects reflecting bourgeois and urban lifestyles as well. For Skansen, he collected entire buildings and farms.\n\nAlthough the project did not initially get the government funding he had hoped, Hazelius received widespread support and donations and by 1898, the \"Society for the promotion of the Nordic Museum\" (\"Samfundet för Nordiska Museets främjande\") had 4,525 members. The Riksdag allocated some money for the museums in 1891 and doubled the amount in 1900, the year before Hazelius died.\n\nThe present building, the design of Isak Gustaf Clason, was completed in 1907 after a 19-year construction process. Originally, it was intended to be a national monument housing the material inheritance of the nation. It was, however, only half-completed for the Stockholm Exposition 1897, and it never was completed to the extent originally planned, three times the actual size. It takes its style from Dutch-influenced Danish Renaissance architecture (i.e. buildings such as Frederiksborg Palace) rather than any specifically Swedish historical models. The core of the “cathedralesque” building is taken up by a huge main hall (126 meters long) passing through all the stories up to the roof and dominated by the enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa, the Swedish so called founder-king. For the construction, brick and granite was used for the walls, while concrete was used for the roof.\n\nThe museum has over 1.5 million objects in its collections, including buildings such as the Julita farm in Södermanland, Svindersvik in Nacka, Tyresö Palace in Tyresö, and the chaplain farm at Härkeberga near Enköping. The museum archive also houses an extensive collection of documents and approximately 6 million photographs dating from the 1840s until today. The museum research library contains 3,800 shelf meters of literature from the 16th century and onward.\n\n"}

A bromate is a chemical compound that contains this ion. Examples of bromates include sodium bromate, (), and potassium bromate, ().\n\nBromates are formed many different ways in municipal drinking water. The most common is the reaction of ozone and bromide:\n\nElectrochemical processes, such as electrolysis of brine without a membrane operating to form hypochlorite, will also produce bromate when bromide ion is present in the brine solution.\n\nPhotoactivation (sunlight exposure) will encourage liquid or gaseous bromine to generate bromate in bromide-containing water.\n\nIn laboratories bromates can be synthesized by dissolving in a concentrated solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The following reactions will take place (via the intermediate creation of hypobromite):\n\nBromate in drinking water is undesirable because it is a suspected human carcinogen. Its presence in Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water forced a recall of that product in the UK.\n\nAlthough few by-products are formed by ozonation, ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce bromate. Bromide can be found in sufficient concentrations in fresh water to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 ppb of bromate—the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA. Proposals to reduce bromate formation include: lowering the water pH below 6.0, limiting the doses of ozone, using an alternate water source with a lower bromide concentration, pretreatment with ammonia, and addition of small concentrations of chloramines prior to ozonation.\n\nOn December 14, 2007, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) announced that it would drain Silver Lake Reservoir and Elysian Reservoir due to bromate contamination. At the Silver Lake and Elysian reservoirs a combination of bromide from well water, chlorine, and sunlight had formed bromate. The decontamination took 4 months, discharging over of contaminated water.\n\nOn June 9, 2008 the LADWP began covering the surface of the , open Ivanhoe Reservoir with black, plastic shade balls to block the sunlight which causes the naturally present bromide to react with the chlorine used in treatment. 3 million of the 40 cent balls are required to cover the Ivanhoe and Elysian reservoirs.\n\nCurrently no bromate-bearing minerals (i.e., the ones with bromate ion being an essential constituent) are known.\n"}
{"id": "2141594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141594", "title": "Moscow State Jewish Theatre", "text": "Moscow State Jewish Theatre\n\nThe Moscow State Jewish (Yiddish) Theatre (Russian: Московский Государственный Еврейский Театр), also known by its acronym GOSET (ГОСЕТ), was a Yiddish theatre company established in 1919 and shut down in 1948 by the Soviet authorities. During its time in operation, it served as a prominent expression of Jewish culture in Russia under Joseph Stalin. Under its founding artistic director, Alexander Granowsky, productions were heavily influenced by the avant-garde trends of Europe and many reflected an expressionistic style. Summertime tours to rural shtetls were extremely popular. At the end of a 1928 tour in Germany, Granowsky defected to the west, and Solomon Mikhoels became artistic director in his place. During Mikhoels' tenure the theatre branched out beyond classic Yiddish theatre productions to include works by Soviet Yiddish writers and William Shakespeare. The theatre continued to operate during World War II in Moscow and, after the evacuation of the city in 1943, in Tashkent. Mikhoels was murdered by the MVD in 1948 and his successor, Benjamin Zuskin, was arrested shortly after. In 1948 the Soviet authorities ordered the theatre to be shut down along with all other Yiddish theatre companies in the Soviet Union.\n\nIt was conceived in 1916 and founded in 1919 by Alexander Granowsky as the Jewish Theatre Workshop in St. Petersburg. Early productions were offered at Maly Theatre, a small, 80-seat space. On April 1, 1920, after the capital was changed to Moscow, the company was moved at the request of Anatoly Lunacharsky and became the Moscow State Jewish Theatre. Lunacharsky, the Soviet Minister of Enlightenment at the time, saw the company's potential to spread the Bolshevik message to the Jewish population of Russia and abroad.\nOnce in Moscow, the company began utilizing a house which was confiscated from a Jewish merchant by the name of L. I. Gurevich who had decided to flee the city around the time of the Russian Revolution. The house, which was built in 1902, consisted of three floors. The second floor featured a large living room that was converted into an auditorium consisting of 90 seats. The kitchen, which was directly adjacent to the new auditorium, was turned into a stage. The first and third floors were reserved for the actors and their families. The house-turned-theatre would later be named Chagall Hall after designer Marc Chagall. The design of the foyer, as well as decorations, sets, and costumes for its first production were done by Chagall. However, this would be Chagall's only collaboration with Granowsky, as the two could not get along.\n\nJanuary 1, 1921 was the date of GOSET's first performance in Moscow, a production called \"An Evening of Sholom Aleichem\". A year later, the company relocated to a substantially larger auditorium on Malya-Bronnaya Street capable of seating 500 people.\n\nGranowsky was heavily influenced by the avant-garde trends of Europe and many of the company's early productions were examples of an expressionistic style. Archetypes, masks, heavy makeup, Cubism, and the grotesque were common staples of the company's performances in the 1920s. German critic Alfred Kerr wrote that Granowsky's productions were one of a kind and gave them high praise. Kerr, a reviewer with a \"hard to please\" reputation, found Granowsky's use of sound, movement, colour, music. and imagery to be both comedic and terrifying. The critic likened the performances to a humanity circus, noting they were without a single dull moment.\nUnlike many theatre companies, GOSET preferred to train their own performers rather than hire actors and dancers who were already considered professionals. By educating their own, inexperienced actors, the company hoped to avoid performers with the melodramatic style common in other Yiddish theatre troupes. Vsevolod Meyerhold's \"biomechanics\" was the preferred acting technique used by company members under Granowsky's direction.\n\nIn the summertime, the company organized tours to the rural provinces where Yiddish theatre was actually more popular than in the larger cities. Shtetl residents looked forward to GOSET performances given near their small towns each year. Audience numbers averaged 1,250 per night on tour, as opposed to the nightly house average of less than 300 for performances in Moscow. One of the best documented tours visited Kiev, Gomel, Odessa, and Kharkov in the summer of 1924 and offered a variety of short sketches called \"A Carnival of Jewish Comedy\" in addition to full-length productions, such as \"The Sorceress\", \"200,000\", and \"God of Vengeance\".\n\nAt the end of GOSET's European tour that took place throughout the majority of 1928, Granowsky chose to remain in Germany, never returning to the Soviet Union. The decision came after years of conflict with Russian authorities over artistic and financial decisions that Granowsky had made for the company. Soon after the theatre's founding, GOSET had attracted Solomon Mikhoels, who eventually became the leading actor; after Granowsky defected to the West, Mikhoels took over as artistic director.\n\nThe theatre's repertoire included adaptations of classic works by Sholem Asch, Mendele Mocher Sforim, Sholom Aleichem—such as \"Tevye the Milkman\" (also adopted in the West as \"Fiddler on the Roof\")—and Avrom Goldfaden—such as \"Bar Kokhba\". Under Mikhoels' direction, the company began to produce works by contemporary Soviet Yiddish writers, such as Shmuel Halkin, Perets Markish, and David Bergelson. Considered their most popular production, in 1935 the theatre produced William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" to great acclaim with Benjamin Zuskin playing the Fool and Mikhoels in the title role of Lear. The international success of the production meant that Mikhoels had achieved one of the theatre company's founding goals: to make Yiddish a language of art for countries around the world.\n\nMany of the theatre's plays were ostensibly supportive of the Soviet state, but closer readings suggest they actually contained veiled critiques of Stalin's regime, most notably the production of \"King Lear\" and the planned production of \"Richard III\". In 1929, in response to a rise in censorship imposed by the government, the company began offering works of Socialist Realism as expected; however, the artists placed Jewish subtext in each production by hiding it within allegory, symbols, and Jewish cultural archetypes. Works of Soviet realism were modestly funded, while works retelling historical Jewish achievements, such as Bar Kochba and the Maccabees, were large-scale productions.\n\nThe company's production of \"Boytre the Bandit\" in 1936 was a Robin Hood-like story written by Moshe Kulbak. The show celebrated the proletariat, and while praised by the press, it was condemned by Lazar Kaganovich, the most prominent Jewish figure in government. Kaganovich chided Mikhoels and the company members of GOSET for not portraying Jewish people in a positive enough light and requested they stick to productions retelling events similar to Bar Kochba. Shorty after, \"Boytre the Bandit\"'s author, Kulbak, was arrested, prosecuted in a trial for show, and executed.\n\nIn October 1936, the Committee of Artistic Affairs informed Mikhoels that he must move away from Granowsky's style of \"formalism\" (defined as a \"departure from reality\") and limit the company's productions to realistic portrayals of Jewish history, Jewish folklore, or Soviet Jewry.\n\n\n\nDuring The Moscow Trials of 1936 to 1938, Mikhoels' daughter confessed that the family lived in fear while witnessing the arrests of many friends and colleagues. Despite the uncertainty of government reactions in the late 1930s, Mikhoels found himself in a position to aid Stalin during World War II by organizing a Jewish resistance movement, the aim of which was to mobilize the world's Jewish population in the struggle against fascism. During the war, GOSET's performances were often interrupted by air-raid sirens that caused both performers and audiences to run for cover underground. Despite this, the company continuously endeavored to offer entertainment to keep the population of Moscow calm and give them an escape from hardships. In October 1941, GOSET was officially restructured by the Committee of Artistic Affairs and its planned productions were replaced by Soviet wartime propaganda pieces. After the evacuation of Moscow, most company members took refuge in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where they continued to present performances to the Uzbek people. The company returned to Moscow in late 1943.\n\nAfter World War II, the rise of antisemitism in Russia caused people once referred to as \"Brother Jew\" to be labeled \"Rootless Cosmopolitan\", and members of government began to interpret Mikhoels' artistic choices as proof of Jewish nationalism. In January 1948, Mikhoels was murdered by the MVD, and his death was made to look like a car accident. Afterwards, Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, would attribute his murder directly to her father's paranoia of Zionist plots.\n\nAfter Mikhoels' death, Benjamin Zuskin took became the company's artistic director. Months later, Zuskin was arrested and the theatre received orders to shut down along with all other Yiddish theatre companies in the Soviet Union. In addition, all members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (also formerly headed by Mikhoels) were arrested. Zuskin was one of at least thirteen prominent Soviet Yiddish artists executed on August 12, 1952 in the event known as \"The Night of the Murdered Poets\" (\"Ночь казненных поэтов\").\n\nGOSET may be referred to today as the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, State Yiddish Theatre, Yiddish Chamber Theatre, Yiddish Worker's Theatre, Jewish State Chamber Theatre, State Yiddish Chamber Theatre, or the Yiddish Theatre-Studio.\n\n\n\n"}

The league was formalized in 1985.\n\nCricket has been played in the United States of America since the early 1700s . Cricket has only been played in Colorado since the mid-1800 .\n\nColorado cricketers Colin McHattie (Secretary), C. Srinivasan (Treasurer) and Dan Ruparel (President), founded what is now known as the Colorado Cricket League. Ruparel has remained active with the league and the Littleton Cricket Club, McHattie is in Texas and Srinivasan in India. They received endorsements from the five teams that played cricket at that time: The Boulder Cricket Club, The Colorado Cricket Club, The Denver Cricket club, The International Cricket Club of CSU, and The Pakistan Cricket Club. None of these clubs are in existence today, except the CSU Cricket Club (see below) has the most direct roots to its predecessor.\n\nGames were initially played on grassy pitches, which were often uncut with a jute mat laid on top. In 1994 the league switched to concrete-based, carpeted wickets. Neutral umpires were introduced in 1985.\n\nThe catalyst that spurred the creation of the Colorado cricket League in 1985 was for hope and expectation to have our players to try out for the US National Cricket team by participating in tournaments in Kansas and Oklahoma, which were part of the USACA's [www.USACA.org] former Central Zone. Unfortunately due to politics the trials were a farce. A year later, the Colorado cricket League pulled out of the USACA in protest, leading a number other leagues to do the same for the same reason - politics.\n\nPrior to 1985, the \"league\" was comprised on 5 team from Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins. Games were scheduled by the team captains calling each other to schedule games for the following weekend. If the team was busy with a game with another team or with a community social event, then a verbal commitment was made to play the next available weekend.\n\nThe captain would then call a representative of another side to get a match scheduled for that weekend. If it worked, a match was played, otherwise the team would end up either playing an intra-squad practice or game and wait for the following weekend.\n\nUpon formalizing the League, schedules were drawn up, standards were created where initially 35 over per inning matches were played. This was changed to 35 in the second year (1986); and in 1992, 40 overs per inning was adopted. One other important modification was adopted - that of neutral umpires. With 5 teams in the league, there was always an idle side. The idle team were responsible to send their more senior players, who it was expected, knew the rules the best, to umpire the matches.\n\nOver the years since then the league has made major strides - hosting invitationals, festivals and tournaments and has played in tournaments in California, Utah, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCCL participates in the Central Western region's annual championship. In 2004 CCL won the plate trophy. In 2006 CCL took second place. Afan Sheriff represented Central West and was declared MVP of the western conference tournament.\n\nIn 1985 CCL was officially incorporated as a non-profit organization. The league runs a cricket tournament which takes place from May to September each year and involves approximately 300 players.\n\nCCL has introduced a pilot program called \"tennis ball cricket\", intended to attract teams from throughout Colorado to increase the league's size to 500 players.\n\nAlthough, not officially associated with the Colorado Cricket League, Colorado also has an indoor cricket league: The Colorado Indoor Cricket Association and an International Cricket Council (ICC) award winning Junior Schools program: The Colorado Junior Cricket Association [www.juniorcricket.com].\n\nThe CCL is made up of eight clubs and nine teams.\n\n\n\nMascarenhas Raymond is credited for being the person to introduce the TennisBall Cricket League in CCL in 2005 that so many players enjoy till today. In 2008 Rockers team won the league format of this tournament.\n\nRockers, the team: http://tennis.coloradocricket.org/teams.php?teams=23&ccl_mode=1\nIn 2010, Orchard won the tournament, while Spartans were runners up.\n\nIn 2004 two of the league's members, Michael Doig and Jarrar Jaffari, recognized the need for a central repository for tracking schedules, scorecards, standings, teams and players. Realizing that the web would be most efficient they set about programming and designing the CCL Official Website, driven by the popular PHP language and MYSQL database. The idea was to design a website that would allow a small group of cricket enthusiasts to easily manage a dynamic cricketing portal. This was achieved due to the steadfast dedication of Doig and Jaffari.\n\nToday the CCL boasts detailed news analysis and statistics of each of its games dating well back into the 1990s. It can be proud that it stands strong and well above many cricketing leagues on the planet for its comprehensive coverage and passion.\n\n"}

He was brought to testify at hearings of the US Congress in May 1987.\n\nCalero was born on December 22, 1931 in Managua to Adolfo Calero Orozco (1899–1980) and María Portocarrero (1911–1944), who had married in 1927. The oldest of four children, he studied in the United States, graduating from University of Notre Dame in 1953 and Syracuse University. In Managua, he managed the Coca-Cola bottling plant.\n\nCalero was associated with the Conservative Party of Nicaragua. From 1963, he was a CIA information source. Before the 1979 overthrow of the government of Anastasio Somoza, he had been briefly imprisoned, which gave credibility to his claims to have opposed Somoza as well as the Sandinistas.\n\nIn early 1983, he joined the political directorate of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). By October he became its president, but many observers wondered about his real power because of the political wing's weak control over the military wing. In a bid to unify contra factions and win aid from the US Congress, he became a member of the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) triumvirate with Alfonso Robelo and Arturo Cruz.\n\nCalero controlled the FDN through his deputy, Aristides Sánchez, and the contras' military commander, Enrique Bermúdez, an alliance so tight that it was dubbed the \"Iron Triangle.\"\n\nHowever, there were tensions below the surface. After the Sapoa ceasefire, Calero exploited discontent with Bermudez among the FDN's field commanders in an effort to push him out. Heavy-handed intervention by the CIA helped to crush that effort. Later, however, other commanders, with the blessing of the US State Department, ousted both their political and military leadership.\nOn July 26, 2011, he published his book \"Cronicas de un Contra\", which narrates his participation during the 1980s in Nicaragua.\n\nCalero married Maria Ernestina Lacayo on December 7, 1957. The couple had two children, Myriam (b. 1958) and Adolfo (1960–1994). Calero has three grandchildren. He had three younger siblings: Myriam (b. 1933-2018) Mario (1935–1993) and Martha (b. 1943).\n\nCalero died in Managua on June 2, 2012 after complications from pneumonia and kidney failure. He is survived by his wife, daughter, three grandchildren, and two sisters.\n\nIn the 2017 film \"American Made\", he was portrayed by Daniel Lugo.\n"}

The effect was caused by the 1997 Asian financial crisis which led Brazil to increase interest rates and to institute spending cuts and tax increases in an attempt to maintain the value of its currency. These measures failed to produce the intended effect and the Brazilian government floated its currency against the US dollar, which led to the dramatic decrease in its value. The devaluation also precipitated fears that the ongoing economic crisis in Asia would spread to South America, as many South American countries were heavily dependent on industrial exports from Brazil. These fears resulted in the Brazilian government adopting an austerity program in order to receive a $41.5 billion aid package from the International Monetary Fund and other world lenders. By the end of 1999 the effect was waning and the Brazilian economy was beginning to recover. However, unemployment was only slightly lower than before the effect, and remained more than twice as high as it was during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n"}

Removed from office following the failed 1965 coup, he spent 29 years in prison.\n\nThe spelling \"Subandrio\" has been official in Indonesia since 1947 but the older spelling Soebandrio is still sometimes used.\n\nSubandrio was born in Malang, East Java, and educated at the Sekolah Tinggi Kedokteran Jakarta (GHS) in Jakarta. As a medical student he was active in the movement for independence. During World War II, while practicing medicine, he worked with anti-Japanese resistance forces. After the war he was appointed secretary-general of the information ministry.\n\nAfter 1945 Subandrio became a supporter of the nationalist leader Sukarno, and was sent as Sukarno's special envoy in Europe, establishing an information office in London in 1947. From 1954 to 1956, he was ambassador to the Soviet Union. During this time he developed strong left wing views, although he was never a Communist as later alleged.\n\nIn 1956 Sukarno recalled him to Jakarta to become secretary-general of the foreign ministry, and then Foreign Minister. In 1960 he was also made Second Deputy Prime Minister, and in 1962 he was appointed Minister for Foreign Economic Relations. He held all three posts, and also acted as intelligence chief, until 1966.\n\nSubandrio was the main architect of Indonesia's left-wing foreign policy during this period, including the alliance with the People's Republic of China and the policy of \"Confrontation\" with Malaysia, which created great hostility between Indonesia and the western powers, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. He was heavily involved in the Sunda Straits Crisis of 1964, when the British aircraft carrier HMS \"Victorious\" passed through Indonesian waters without proper approval.\n\nOn 30 September 1965 a group of army officers, allegedly supported by the powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), attacked a part of the Army leadership that was supposedly plotting to overthrow Sukarno. Six Army generals were killed but the alleged \"coup attempt\" failed. In the resulting anti-Communist backlash the conservative General Suharto took control of the government. Sukarno tried to retain Subandrio in the cabinet, but in 1966 he was forced to agree to his dismissal.\n\nSubandrio was sentenced to death by the Extraordinary Military Court on charges of being involved in the \"30 September Movement,\" although there was no real evidence that Subandrio knew of the plot in advance or played any part in it (he was in Sumatra at the time). This sentence was afterwards reduced to life imprisonment upon the request of the British government on behalf of Queen Elizabeth, as it was remembered that Subandrio was Indonesia's first envoy to the U.K. He remained in prison until 1995, when he was released due to ill health. He died in Jakarta in 2004.\n\n"}
{"id": "2141673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141673", "title": "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow", "text": "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow\n\nThe Man Who Saw Tomorrow is a 1981 documentary-style movie about the predictions of French astrologer and physician Michel de Notredame (Nostradamus).\n\n\"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow\" is narrated (some might say \"hosted\") by Orson Welles. The film depicts many of Nostradamus' predictions as evidence of Nostradamus' predicting ability, though as with other works, nothing is offered which conclusively proves his accuracy. The last quarter of the film discusses Nostradamus' supposed prediction for the then future of the 1980s, 1990s and beyond. There are no scientifically testable predictions directly included in this film, only suggestions and allusions.\n\nWelles, though he agreed to host the film, was not a believer in the subject matter presented. Welles' main objection to the generally accepted translations of Nostradamus' quatrains (so called because Nostradamus organized all his works into a series of four lined prose, which were then collected into \"centuries\", or groups of 100 such works) relates in part to the translation efforts. While many skilled linguists have worked on the problem of translating the works of Nostradamus, all have struggled with the format the author used.\n\nNostradamus lived and wrote during a period of political and religious censorship. Because of this it is said he disguised his writings not only with somewhat cryptic language, but in four different languages (Latin, French, Italian and Greek). Not content with such obfuscation, Nostradamus is also said to have used anagrams to further confuse potential inquisitors (particularly with respect to names and places).\n\nWelles himself completely rejected the central theme of the film after having made it. It is not known if Welles was contractually obligated to narrate the film, or if he simply grew disenchanted with its subject matter and presentation after completing it. Perhaps Welles' most public criticism of the subject matter of the film occurred during a guest appearance on an early 1980s episode of \"The Merv Griffin Show\"; \"One might as well make predictions based on random passages from the phone book\", he offered when asked about the film, before moving on to discuss other projects more interesting to him personally.\n\n\nOn February 20, 1991, during the Gulf War, NBC aired a remake of this film, hosted and narrated by Charlton Heston. Much of the same footage, voice acting, and musical score was retained from the original movie. Much of Heston's narration constituted a verbatim reprise of Welles' original presentation. There were, however, some significant differences between the 1991 remake and the original film:\n\n\nThe nature of the overall changes served the purpose of brevity, reducing an eighty-eight-minute film to a one-hour television broadcast, including commercial interruptions. Moreover, the predictions relating to the third tyrant were adapted to serve U.S. propaganda purposes during the then-occurring Gulf War. The severity of the natural disasters preceding the tyrant's emergence was reduced, as a worldwide famine leading to cannibalism, and earthquakes and flooding in various European cities, had clearly not taken place. Similarly, the severity of the third tyrant's war was diminished, omitting references to the conquest of Europe, nuclear war, and the destruction of New York City, as well as the prediction that the war would begin in 1994. Significantly, to avoid offence to Muslims, negative references to Islam, and references to the religious nature of the tyrant (calling him an Antichrist and a \"strong master of Mohammedan law\") and his war were eliminated, as well as the portrayal of the then-current Gulf conflict as a religious war.\n\nAlthough David L. Wolper was the executive producer of \"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow\" and arranged for the film to be re-edited into the 1991 television special, he was quoted as saying before the broadcast, \"If you're asking me if I believe any of this ... the answer is a most definite 'no.'\"\n"}

{"id": "2141852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141852", "title": "Howard Da Silva", "text": "Howard Da Silva\n\nHoward Da Silva (born Howard Silverblatt, May 4, 1909 – February 16, 1986) was an American actor, director and musical performer on stage, film, television and radio. He was cast in dozens of productions on the New York stage, appeared in more than two dozen television programs, and acted in more than fifty feature films. Adept at both drama and musicals on the stage, he originated the role of Jud Fry in the original 1943 run of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \"Oklahoma!\", and also portrayed the prosecuting attorney in the 1957 stage production of \"Compulsion\". Da Silva was nominated for a 1960 Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his work in \"Fiorello!\", a musical about New York City mayor LaGuardia. In 1961, Da Silva directed \"Purlie Victorious\", by Ossie Davis.\n\nMany of his early feature films were of the noir genre in which he often played villains, such as Eddie Harwood in \"The Blue Dahlia\" and the sadistic Captain Francis Thompson in \"Two Years Before the Mast\" (both 1946). Da Silva's characterization of historic figures are among some of his most notable work: he was Lincoln's brawling friend Jack Armstrong in both play (1939) and film (1940) versions of \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" written by Robert Sherwood; Benjamin Franklin in the 1969–1972 stage musical \"1776\" and a reprisal of the role for the 1972 film version of the production; Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in \"The Missiles of October\" (1974); Franklin D. Roosevelt in \"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover\" (1977); and Louis B. Mayer in \"Mommie Dearest\" (1981).\n\nDa Silva's American television character work included the defense attorney representing the robot in \"The Outer Limits\" episode \"I, Robot\" (1964), and district attorney Anthony Cleese in \"For the People\" (1965). For his performance as Eddie in the \"Great Performances\" production of \"Verna: USO Girl\" (1978), the actor received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special.\n\nIn the 1970s, Da Silva appeared in 26 episodes of the radio series, the \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\".\n\nDa Silva was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Bertha (née Sen) and Benjamin Silverblatt, a dress cutter. His parents were both Yiddish-speaking Jews born in Russia. His mother was a women's-rights activist. Before beginning his acting career on the stage, he was employed as a steelworker.\n\nDa Silva was a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology and studied acting with Eva Le Gallienne beginning in 1928 at the Civic Repertory Theatre. He changed his surname to the Portuguese Da Silva (the name is sometimes misspelled Howard De Silva).\n\nDa Silva appeared in a number of Broadway musicals, including the role of Larry Foreman in the legendary first production of Marc Blitzstein's musical, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" (1938). Later, he costarred in the original 1943 stage production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\", playing the role of the psychopathic Jud Fry. He was the easygoing Ben Marino who opposed Tammany Hall in the Pulitzer winning musical \"Fiorello!\".\n\nIn 1969, Da Silva originated the role of Benjamin Franklin in the musical \"1776\". Four days before the show opened on Broadway, he suffered a minor heart attack but refused to seek medical assistance because he wanted to make sure critics saw his performance. After the four official critic performances were over, the cast left to go to the cast party and Da Silva went to the hospital and immediately took a leave of absence from the production. While Da Silva recuperated, his understudy, Rex Everhart, took over the role and performed on the cast recording. Da Silva was able to reprise his role in the 1972 film version and appeared on that soundtrack album.\n\nDa Silva did summer stock at the Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, with the Group Theatre (New York) formed by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg in the 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nDa Silva appeared in over 60 motion pictures. Some of his memorable roles include a leading mutineer in \"The Sea Wolf\" (1941), playing Ray Milland's bartender in \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945), and the half-blind criminal \"Chicamaw 'One-Eye' Mobley\" in \"They Live by Night\" (1949). He also released an album on Monitor Records (MP 595) of political songs and ballads entitled \"Politics and Poker\".\n\nDa Silva returned to the stage, and was nominated for the 1960 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his role as \"Ben Marino\" in \"Fiorello!\" (1959). After being blacklisted, Da Silva and Nelson left Los Angeles for New York to perform in \"The World of Sholom Aleichem\".\n\nDa Silva was nominated for the British BAFTA Film Award for Best Foreign Actor for his performance as Dr. Swinford in \"David and Lisa\" (1962). Da Silva portrayed Soviet Premier Khrushchev in the television docudrama \"The Missiles of October\" (1974). He won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special for his role as Eddie in \"\" (1978) with Sissy Spacek.\n\nDa Silva's TV guest appearances, after the era in which blacklisting was strongest, include such programs as \"The Outer Limits\", \"Ben Casey\", \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", \"The Fugitive\", \"Gentle Ben\", \"Mannix\", \"Love, American Style\", \"Kung Fu\", and \"Archie Bunker's Place\".\n\nDa Silva also played President Franklin D. Roosevelt in \"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover\" (1977), Hollywood mogul Louis B. Mayer in \"Mommie Dearest\" (1981), and American statesman Benjamin Franklin in \"1776\" (1972), as well as a documentary depicting the life of Ben Franklin shown at Franklin's house in Philadelphia. He appeared in two different film adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, \"The Great Gatsby\". In the 1949 production with Alan Ladd as Gatsby, Da Silva played garage owner George Wilson; in the 1974 film with Robert Redford, Da Silva was Meyer Wolfsheim, the flamboyant gambler with the interesting cufflinks. In his final appearance on screen, Da Silva played a New York photographer fascinated with the reclusive Greta Garbo in the film \"Garbo Talks\" (1984), directed by Sidney Lumet.\n\nHe also did voice acting in 26 episodes of the popular 1974–82 radio thriller series \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\" (between July 1974 and February 1977). In 1978, he recorded linking narration for episodes of the British television program \"Doctor Who\" broadcast in the United States.\n\nDa Silva became one of hundreds of artists blacklisted in the entertainment industry during the House Committee on Unamerican Activities investigation into alleged Communist influence in the industry. Following his March 1951 testimony in which he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, his lead performance in the completed feature film \"Slaughter Trail\" was re-shot with actor Brian Donlevy. Da Silva continued to find work on the New York stage, but did not work in feature films again until 1961 when he appeared in \"David and Lisa\" (a BAFTA-nominated performance). He was eventually cleared of any charges in 1960, but not before his career in television had also stalled, with no work between 1951 and 1959 when he appeared in \"The Play of the Week\". The brief respite was followed by another television career void until his appearance in a 1963 episode of \"The Defenders\". That was the beginning of the end of Da Silva's blacklist, and the show's producer Herb Brodkin paired Da Silva with William Shatner when he created the television series \"For the People\".\n\nDa Silva married actress Marjorie Nelson in 1949. Da Silva and Nelson divorced in 1960. He married twice more and had a total of two sons and three daughters.\n\nDa Silva died of lymphoma, aged 76, in Ossining, New York.\n\nHoward Da Silva provided linking narration for North American broadcasts of Doctor Who.\n\nSpecifically, he provided continuity announcements for episodes from season 12 through season 15, ostensibly to help North American audiences get acclimatized to the nature of serial storytelling, which was then uncommon on non-soap-operatic television in the United States and Canada. His narration accompanied the earliest runs of Doctor Who as broadcast on American PBS stations and Canadian broadcasters like TVOntario during the 1970s and early 1980s. Typically, after Doctor Who had been run on a station for a while, the linking narration was removed as unnecessary. Nevertheless, the announcements were so familiar a part of some viewers' experience of Doctor Who that they became a standard extra feature on BBC DVD releases of early Tom Baker serials.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2141906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2141906", "title": "Erkki Salmenhaara", "text": "Erkki Salmenhaara\n\nErkki Olavi Salmenhaara (March 12, 1941 – March 19, 2002) was a Finnish composer and musicologist.\n\nSalmenhaara was born in Helsinki, Finland, and married Anja Kosonen in 1961. They had two sons, but divorced in 1978. Salmenhaara died in Helsinki on March 19, 2002.\n\nSalmenhaara studied composition with Joonas Kokkonen at the Sibelius Academy until 1963, and then continued his studies with György Ligeti in Vienna. Salmenhaara then studied musicology, aesthetics and theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki, and earned his PhD in 1970 with a doctoral thesis about the works of the composer Ligeti. He served as lecturer (1966–1975) and associate professor (1975–2002) of musicology at the University of Helsinki and was also the leading writer on classical music in Finland. In addition, he served as chairman of the Society of Finnish Composers (1974–1976) and of the Association of Finnish Symphony Orchestras (1974–1978).\n\nPrior to studying with Kokkonen, Salmenhaara had already written several tonal pieces, including the 17 Small Pieces for Piano (1957–1960). In the early 1960s, he was associated with the modernist Finnish Musical Youth.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Salmenhaara's works began to be characterized by frequent repetition of triadic motives with gradual changes in harmony. Although this led to his being linked to the movement in music known as minimalism, Salmenhaara nonetheless denied this connection. Like the works of the Dutch minimalist composer Simeon ten Holt, Salmenhaara's works from this period utilize a musical language closely related to that of the Romantic period of classical music, giving his music a decidedly European aesthetic. Salmenhaara's compositions include several symphonic works, chamber music pieces, choral works, songs for solo instrument, and vocal arts songs. He also wrote one opera, \"Portugalin nainen\" (The Portuguese Woman) which premiered at the Suomen Kansallisooppera in February 1976.\n\nSalmenhaara's published writings include a textbook on music theory, a history of 20th-century music, monographs on Ligeti, Jean Sibelius's \"Tapiola\" and the Brahms symphonies, biographies of Jean Sibelius and Leevi Madetoja, and a history of the Society of Finnish Composers. He also contributed to Erik W. Tawaststjerna's comprehensive biography of Sibelius. His most significant literary work was his contribution to a four-volume history of Finnish music (published in 1995–1996), writing about the period from the Romantic era to the Second World War. In addition, from 1963 to 1973, he served as a critic for the leading Finnish newspaper \"Helsingin Sanomat\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played his first grade Australian club football for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, retiring at the end of the 2000 NRL season having played 328 first grade games for the club, the NSWRL/ARL/SL/NRL record for most games at a single club. This record stood for ten years, before ultimately being broken by Darren Lockyer for the Broncos in 2010.\n\n\"ET\" as he was known, represented both New South Wales, and the Australian Kangaroos, and was twice a Kangaroo tourist. After his retirement from league in 2000, Ettingshausen went on to host and produce his own fishing television show titled \"Escape with ET\".\n\nEttingshausen was originally signed to the Cronulla side as a teenager before making his début at eighteen while still at school. He quickly cemented a place in the Sharks first grade side and ultimately played 328 first grade games with the club over eighteen seasons.\n\nEttingshausen was born in the southern Sydney suburb of Sutherland, and began his rugby league career playing for his local club side at the age of six. He was subsequently scouted and signed as a junior to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\n\nWhile attending Cronulla De La Salle, Ettingshausen played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1982 and 1983.\n\nCronulla coach Terry Fearnley gave Andrew Ettingshausen his first grade début for the Sharks in round 5 of the 1983 season against the Newtown Jets at . His début was somewhat of an uneventful affair, although he did cross for a try in the second half.\n\nIn the 1985 season, he scored a total of ten tries playing mostly from fullback or in the s in his third season and finally cemented his spot in the Sharks squad.\n\nEttingshausen also made an appearance in the 1988 Australian television movie \"The First Kangaroos\", which depicted the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. Also having a small role in the movie was his NSW teammate and captain Wayne Pearce.\n\nIn 1987, Ettingshausen made his début for New South Wales on the wing in Game 1 of the 1987 State of Origin series at Lang Park in Brisbane.\n\nThe 1988 season was the high point of his early years when he was moved off the wing and into the centres where he would remain for the majority of his career. He made the first of eight appearances for City Origin in 1988, playing on the wing in City's 20-18 win over Country Origin in the annual City vs Country Origin match. He then went on to be one of the better players for NSW in the 1988 Origin series which Queensland won 3-0. Off the back of these performances Ettingshausen was selected for his first test match for Australia.\n\nAfter a successful 1990 NSWRL season in which he played fullback in all three Origin games for NSW which saw The Blues win the series for the first time since 1986, and after scoring 13 tries in 20 games for Cronulla, he was selected for the 17th Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France where he played in all five tests on tour against Great Britain and France. Ettingshausen came of age on tour, playing in 12 games and finishing as the highest try scorer for the 28-man touring squad with 15 , including hat-tricks against powerhouse English sides St. Helens and Wigan in the opening two games. It was these efforts which cemented his place in the first test against Great Britain at Wembley Stadium where the home side pulled off a shock 19-12 win, their first test win on home soil against Australia since the second test of the 1978 Kangaroo tour. Despite the loss, Australia bounced back and secured The Ashes with wins at Old Trafford and Elland Road with Ettingshausen scoring his only try of the test series in the 14-0 win in the deciding test. \n\nDespite a slow start to the 1992 NSWRL season playing fullback for the Sharks, Ettingshausen was picked at fullback for NSW for all three games of the 1992 Origin series which saw NSW win 2-1. He was then picked at fullback for all three tests against Great Britain in The Ashes.\n\nHe was selected on the wing for NSW for games 1 and 2 of the 1993 Origin series, and at centre for game 3. He missed Australian selection for the 1st test of their two test tour of New Zealand & was selected on the reserves bench for the 2nd test played in Palmerston North. For the 3rd test back in Brisbane he was again a reserve.\n\n1994 saw Ettingshausen back at his best, seeing him score a total of 18 tries from just 18 games and leading the Sharks by example after also being awarded the captaincy of the Sharks. Five of his 18 tries came in one match against South Sydney at The Sharks home ground, Endeavour Field in Round 22 as the Sharks humiliated the Rabbitohs 42-0. With his 3rd try against Manly-Warringah in Round 5 (his 6th of the season), Ettingshausen brought up his 100th try for the Cronulla club. He would finish the season with 112 tries for Cronulla. At the end of the 1994 season, he was selected for his second Kangaroo tour. In almost a carbon copy of his 1990 Tour, Ettingshausen was the team's top try scorer with 15 from 11 games played which included all three tests playing on the wing against Great Britain and the single test against France. Ettingshausen remains the only player to be the leading try scorer on consecutive Kangaroo tours.\n\nEttingshausen captained Cronulla-Sutherland to the 1997 Super League Grand Final, but they lost 26-8 to the Brisbane Broncos in front of 58,912 fans at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane (the Broncos home ground) in what was the first night Grand Final played in Australia and the first not to be played in Sydney. He then toured with the Australian SL team to Great Britain and France at the end of 1997, playing all four tests (three against Great Britain, and one against France) in the centres. Other than the 1992 Ashes series, this was the only time ET failed to score a try for Australia in a full test series.\n\nIn the 1999 NRL season, Ettingshausen played 26 games for Cronulla as the club won the minor premiership after enjoying one of their best ever seasons. Ettingshausen played in the club's preliminary final defeat against St George at Stadium Australia.\n\nEttingshausen played on for Cronulla in the 2000 NRL season which would be his last. His final game as a player came in round 23 2000 against the Auckland Warriors which Cronulla won 22-12 at Shark Park.\n\nHe ended up playing a total of 328 first grade games, all for Cronulla which at the time became the record for the most games for a single club, and 6th highest overall. His record was broken when Darren Lockyer played his 329th game for the Brisbane Broncos in Round 25 of the 2009 NRL season. As of the 2013 NRL season, ET sits 6th on the NSWRL/ARL/SL/NRL all-time games list behind Lockyer (355), Terry Lamb (349), Steve Menzies (349), Brad Fittler (336) and Cliff Lyons (332).\n\nDuring the 1991 NSWRL season Ettingshausen filed a defamation lawsuit against the Australian \"HQ\" magazine and photographer Brett Cochrane. Cochrane had taken a photo of Ettingshausen while he was in the shower on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. The magazine ran the shot in 1991 without his permission. Ettingshausen successfully sued the magazine for originally $350,000 which was later reduced to $100,000 after appeal.\n\nIn 2012, Ettingshausen admitted to having a 12-month affair with the wife of close friend Paul Mellor. He also revealed he had been suffering from depression.\n\nEttingshausen first played in the annual City vs Country Origin game in 1988. He would go on to make eight appearances for the team until his final selection in 1996. He scored 4 tries in the 8 games, and in a pointer to higher representative honors, his first game was on the wing.\n\nEttingshausen made his New South Wales début in the 1987 State of Origin series, and over the next nine years went on to bring his tally of State of Origin games to twenty-seven. He made his début on the wing but went on to cover both the positions of fullback and centre, scoring a total of seven Origin tries, plus another three in his three games for NSW during the 1997 Super League Tri-series where he played all games, including the series Final against Queensland at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane, in the centres. The game was drawn 18-18 at the end of regular time (80 minutes) and 22-22 after a further 20 minutes of extra time, and only ended only after NSW halfback Noel Goldthorpe kicked a field goal in the 104th minute. This made it the longest-ever game of first class rugby league.\n\nEttingshausen played in 29 Test matches for Australia (including 4 with the Super League Australian team) between 1988 and 1997. He made his test début in the green and gold on 11 June 1988 against the touring Great Britain Lions, playing on the wing at the Sydney Football Stadium. In the 100th test between the two teams, Australia defeated the tourists 17-6 He would score his first test try in the second game of the series at Lang Park as the Aussies retained The Ashes with a 34-14 victory.\n\nEttingshausen was selected to both the 1990 and 1994 Kangaroo Tours, playing in all 9 tests played over the two tours, and holds the distinction of being the only ever Kangaroo Tourist to be the leading try scorer on consecutive tours, crossing for 15 tries on each tour. He was also selected to the 1991 tour of Papua New Guinea.\n\nEttingshausen's 29th and final test for Australia came during the 1997 Super League Test series at the Elland Road stadium in Leeds, England where Australia defeated Great Britain 37-20.\n\nDespite being one of the first choice backs selected for representative sides during his career, Ettingshausen never played in a Rugby League World Cup Final for the Kangaroos. He missed selection when Australia defeated New Zealand 25-12 in 1988 at Eden Park, was unavailable through injury when Australia defeated Great Britain 10-6 in 1992 at Wembley, and wasn't selected for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup which was played at the height of the Super League war, and the Australian Rugby League controversially did not select any Super League aligned players (though Australia would still go on to win the Final at Wembley 16-8 over hosts England).\n\nIn total, Ettingshausen played 29 tests for Australia (5 at fullback, 14 on the wing, 10 in the centres and 4 off the bench), plus another 15 tour matches. He scored 14 test tries and 25 in the tour games.\n\nEttingshausen's 165 tries is the fourth highest tally in Australian first grade rugby league, behind Ken Irvine (212), Steven Menzies (180) and Billy Slater (172). His tally is also the second highest total for any player who played their entire career at a single club behind Slater who has played his entire career for the Melbourne Storm.\n\nAndrew Ettingshausen is one of ten players to have scored more than 150 tries in his NSWRL/ARL/SL/NRL career.\n\nAfter the 2005 Cronulla riots, Ettingshausen was selected along with fellow sports stars Susie Maroney, Nick Davis, Mark Ella, and former Sharks teammate Jason Stevens to head the $250,000 NSW government campaign to promote Sydney's beach suburbs as safe for everyone.\n\nIn February 2008, Ettingshausen was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\n\nIn 1992, the Cronulla club extended their ground at Endeavour Field, adding a new stand to the ground at a cost of 2.5 million dollars. The club originally calling the stand the 'Western Endeavour' grandstand but with the retirement of Andrew Ettingshausen in 2000 the club decided to name it the 'Andrew Ettingshausen' stand in his honour.\n\n2003 saw the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks name the top ten Sharks legends of all-time as nominated by fans and picked by a panel of experts. Ettingshausen was named amongst the ten and was then further honoured by being picked as one of the three first immortals of the club along with Gavin Miller and Steve Rogers\n\nWith his retirement from rugby league, Ettingshausen launched his media career with his own television show on the Nine Network in 1997 titled, \"Escape with ET\". The show is essentially a fishing show hosted by Ettingshausen though it also focuses on many water sports (such as white water rafting and wakeboarding), off-road 4WD driving and other outdoors activities.\n\nThe show has been currently running for eight years to date and in 2005 moved to rival network Network Ten. It usually had a celebrity appearing on each episode including former professional rugby league footballers such as David Peachey and Ryan Girdler along with others including Paul Kelly, John Barnes and Layne Beachley.\n\nIn 2014, Ettingshausen won an Asian Television Award for best sports presenter.\n\nIn 2015, Ettingshausen hosted the four part Discovery Channel series \"Saltwater Heroes\".\n\nIn 2019, Ettingshausen competed in the sixth season of \"Australian Survivor\". He was eliminated on Day 14 and finished in 19th place.\n\n"}

He originally planned to attend the University of Connecticut on a basketball scholarship; however, the 17-year-old made the decision to go directly into the NBA and made himself eligible for the 2005 NBA draft, where he was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn the 2005 NBA draft, Bynum was selected 10th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers. At age , Bynum was 12 days younger than Jermaine O'Neal, the previous youngest player drafted by an NBA team. After selecting him in the draft, the Lakers hired Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to work with Bynum. On November 2, 2005, during the Lakers' season opener against the Denver Nuggets, Bynum played six minutes and became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game at age . During the game, he missed his two field goal attempts but had two rebounds and two blocks. In his second season, Bynum was still the youngest player in the league, due to his draft year being the last that a player could be drafted straight out of high school.\n\nIn a game against the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bynum matched up against former Laker center Shaquille O'Neal for the first time. At one point, O'Neal dunked over Bynum on a putback attempt. On the next play, Bynum spun past O'Neal and dunked the ball. He then ran down the court and shoved O'Neal with his elbow, who retaliated by elbowing Bynum's upper chest. Teammate Kobe Bryant quickly stepped in between the two. Both Bynum and O'Neal received technical fouls for the incident.\n\nBynum showed flashes of dominance but was far from consistent. He had then-career highs of 16 rebounds and seven blocks on January 26, 2006 against the Charlotte Bobcats. His first career double-double on November 7 included a career-high 20 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks against the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he had 19 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks on January 5 against Denver Nuggets.\n\nWith Lakers centers Chris Mihm and Kwame Brown injured at the start of the 2006–07, Bynum served as their starting center. Bynum scored 18 points and had 9 rebounds in 24 minutes against the Phoenix Suns on October 31, 2006, making seven of his eleven attempts from the field. He appeared in 82 games and started 53 and finished the season with averages of 7.8 points and 5.9 rebounds, in just over 21 minutes per game. He also averaged 1.6 blocks per game. During the season, the New Jersey Nets were interested in acquiring Bynum for Jason Kidd.\n\nAfter the season, Coach Pete Newell was impressed with Bynum's development, and stated that teammate Kobe Bryant should back off on his negative treatment of Bynum on the court. Bryant was also shown on an infamous amateur video saying that center Bynum should have been traded for Kidd.\nThe Indiana Pacers also made a trade offer for Bynum. The Lakers would exercise a fourth-year contract option on Bynum.\n\nBynum helped the Lakers start to a 26–11 record, which was at the time the best record in the Pacific Division. Bynum played 35 games and started in 25 games during the season. On Christmas Day against the Phoenix Suns, he made 11-of-13 shots for 28 points to complement 12 boards, 4 assists and 2 blocks.\n\nOn January 13, 2008, he suffered an injury during a game against the Memphis Grizzlies. Bynum partially dislocated his left kneecap when he landed awkwardly on teammate Lamar Odom's left foot while attempting to grab a rebound. After Bynum's injury, the Lakers acquired Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nIn March, there were reports that he could return before the end of the 2007–08 season or the first round of the playoffs; however, Lakers coach Phil Jackson said that he did not foresee Bynum making serious contributions any time soon in April. In May, rumors about his return were put to rest when Bynum underwent arthroscopic surgery on his kneecap. He missed 46 games due to the injury, and finished the season with averages of 13.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks and a .636 field goal percentage. Without Bynum, the Lakers made it to the 2008 NBA Finals, but lost to the Boston Celtics in six games.\n\nIn September 2008, Bynum said that he was 100% healthy and was ready to participate in training camp, which was scheduled to begin at the end of the month, after working with his trainer. On October 30, 2008, he agreed to sign a 4-year, $58 million contract with the Lakers.\nBynum set a new career high in scoring with 42 points to go along with 15 rebounds (8 offensive) and 3 blocked shots on January 21, 2009 against the Los Angeles Clippers. On the next night, January 22, versus the Washington Wizards he scored 23 points to go along with 14 rebounds.\nOn January 27, 2009, in a double overtime loss against the Charlotte Bobcats, Bynum committed a flagrant foul, fracturing the rib and subsequently collapsing the lung of Gerald Wallace of the Bobcats.\nWhile playing against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 31, 2009, Kobe Bryant had an off balanced shot, fell and collided with Bynum's right knee, resulting in a right knee sprain. On February 2, 2009 it was revealed that Bynum had suffered a torn MCL in his right knee and would be out 8–12 weeks. This was the second straight year that Bynum had suffered a knee injury against the Grizzlies. He had averaged 26 points and 14 rebounds in his previous five games, posting five straight double-doubles.\n\nBynum missed the next 32 games. On April 9, 2009, he returned from injury in a home game against the Denver Nuggets. Bynum went 0–2 in the first half, but finished with 7–11 by the end of the game. With the 21 minutes that Bynum played, he scored 16 points and grabbed 7 rebounds. Still recovering from his knee injury, he played in the playoffs wearing an awkward knee brace. He was not the same player, averaging 6.3 points and 3.7 rebounds while often in foul trouble. The Lakers advanced to the 2009 NBA Finals against the Orlando Magic. Although Bynum averaged just 19 minutes against the Magic and their center Dwight Howard, the Lakers won the championship.\n\nIn the 2010 NBA playoffs, Bynum injured his knee in Game 6 against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round. It was the third consecutive season his knee injuries impacted the Lakers postseason. However, he kept on playing, and the Lakers won their second championship in a row. Postponing surgery until after the playoffs, Bynum appeared in all 23 of the Lakers' playoff games, averaging 8.6 points and 6.9 rebounds. Teammate Pau Gasol called Bynum's \"tenacity remarkable. He gave his best. He sacrificed himself in order to help the team and have a better chance to win the championship.\"\n\nBefore having surgery on his knee, Bynum attended the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and vacationed in Europe. \"It's not the most serious (injury)\", Bynum said of his torn meniscus. \"I'm going to get it taken care of, and then everything is supposed to be cool.\" Bynum underwent surgery on July 28.\n\nA longer than expected recovery period was needed for Bynum's surgery that caused him to miss the beginning of the 2010–11 NBA season. Bynum gave the Lakers advance notice hours, not weeks, before the opening of training camp. He acknowledged that his doctor told him in advance that he might need more repair to the knee based on findings once the surgery began. Bynum said he would make the same decision again to delay the surgery until after his vacation, even with the knowledge that it would cost him a portion of the upcoming regular season. Kevin Ding of The Orange County Register and Michael Rosenberg of Sports Illustrated criticized Bynum for his summer activities and not expecting complications based on his history with injuries and recovery time.\n\nBynum came off the bench in his first game of the season on December 14 in a 103–89 win over the Wizards. He finished with 17 minutes, 1-of-5 from the field, seven points, four rebounds and two blocks. \"I feel light-years better than back [in Game 7 of 2010 NBA Finals]\", he said. In his first 24 games played during the season, Bynum averaged 24.6 minutes per game and 27.4 minutes in 17 games as a starter. Jackson was limiting Bynum's minutes in an attempt to minimize his risk of injury. At the All-Star break, Jackson discussed with Bynum that his primary role should be to defend and rebound—not score. It was a role Bynum had previously resisted.\n\nOn March 8, Bynum had his third straight game with at least 16 rebounds and had 50 rebounds and 12 blocks in that span. As the Lakers went 8–0 after the All-Star break, Bynum had 10 or more rebounds five times and blocked three or more shots four times while the Lakers held opponents to just 87 points per game. The Lakers revised their defense to have big men no longer were responsible for the perimeter against guards coming off screens, and Lakers' defenders would instead funnel the plays inside to Bynum.\n\nOn March 14, Bynum tied his career high in rebounds with 18 against Howard and the Magic.\n\nOn March 20, Bynum was suspended for two games by the NBA for a flagrant foul on Michael Beasley of the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nOn April 5, in a loss to the Utah Jazz, he grabbed a career high 23 rebounds.\n\nOn April 12 against the San Antonio Spurs, Bynum hyper-extended his right knee A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam revealed he had a bruised knee, and he missed the last game of the regular season. Bynum ended the season averaging 11 points, 12 rebounds and 2.4 blocks after the All-Star break. He returned to the lineup for the start of the playoffs. After the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round, 4–2, Hornets head coach Monty Williams said, \"Kobe's Kobe, but I thought Bynum decided the series. He was that good.\"\n\nIn the Lakers' second-round playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks, Bynum was ejected in the final game of the Mavericks' four-game sweep for a flagrant foul on J. J. Barea moments after teammate Lamar Odom was ejected for fouling Dirk Nowitzki. Bynum's actions were condemned by the sports news media, and he was suspended four games for the next season and fined $25,000.\n\nJackson retired from coaching after 2010–11, and Mike Brown was hired as his replacement. During Brown's interview for the position, Lakers executive Jim Buss said Bynum needed to receive the ball inside, and Brown planned for Bynum to get the ball \"more than what he did in the past.\" The new coach believed Bynum could become an All-Star, and perennial All-Star center Yao Ming had retired and Tim Duncan's skills were declining. In his first game of the season after serving his suspension, Bynum scored 29 points on 13 for 18 shooting and grabbed 13 rebounds, leading the Lakers to a 92–89 victory over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nOn January 3 against the Houston Rockets, Bynum had 21 points and 22 rebounds in the first 20–20 game of his career. He was selected as a starter to his first All-Star Game. Bynum was awarded Western Conference Player of the Week honors for the second time of his young career for games played Monday, March 12, through Sunday, March 18. He led the Lakers to a 3–1 week, leading the West in rebounding (14.8 rpg) and placed second in scoring (27.5) while shooting .665 from the field (fourth in the Conference). On March 28 against the Golden State Warriors, Bynum was benched by coach Mike Brown for the remainder of the third quarter after attempting an ill-advised three-point field goal with 10:05 left and the Lakers leading 56–50. Bynum did not join his teammates in huddles during multiple timeouts in the fourth quarter, instead sitting by himself toward the end of the bench. He was fined by the team around $7,500 for his actions. About a week later, he was again not involved in timeouts against an undermanned New Orleans Hornets team, explaining afterwards that he was resting and \"getting my Zen on.\"\n\nOn April 11, Bynum grabbed a career and an NBA season-high 30 rebounds against the San Antonio Spurs to become the fifth Lakers player ever to register at least 30 rebounds in a single game. Bynum finished the regular season with career highs in minutes per game (tied NBA 24th overall), rebounds per game (NBA 3rd overall), and points per game (NBA 20th overall). He also finished with the 3rd highest field-goal percentage in the league and 6th overall in blocks per game. Bynum ended the season tied with Oklahoma City All-Star guard Russell Westbrook at 10th overall in Player Efficiency Rating (PER) with a PER of 23.00. Bynum only missed one game the entire season due to injury (ankle). He became widely mentioned along with Howard as being the top center playing in the NBA.\n\nIn a 103–88 win against the Nuggets in the opening game of the playoffs, Bynum had a triple-double with 10 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 blocked shots. The blocked shots broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's franchise record of nine, and tied the NBA playoff record set by Mark Eaton and Hakeem Olajuwon. After the Lakers led the series 3–1, Bynum said, \"Close-out games are actually kind of easy.\" The Lakers eventually won the series 4–3 with Bynum contributing a career playoff-high 18 rebounds in Game 7.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, the Lakers exercised their $16.1-million team option on Bynum's contract for the 2012–13 season. On August 10, he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in a four-team deal that also sent Dwight Howard from the Magic to the Lakers and Andre Iguodala from the 76ers to the Denver Nuggets. The Magic decided against receiving Bynum due to concerns over his knees and his upcoming free agent status.\n\nAbout a week before training camp, Bynum underwent Orthokine treatments on both of his knees to stimulate healing for his arthritis. As a precaution at the start of camp, the 76ers decided to hold Bynum out from basketball activities for three weeks after he experienced discomfort in his knees. He was also diagnosed with a bone bruise to his right knee that was unrelated to the treatments he received. He did not practice or play with the team prior to the season, and suffered another setback after injuring his left knee while bowling. In November, Sixers general manager Tony DiLeo said Bynum's knees had worsened since the trade, and Bynum was declared out indefinitely. Since training camp, Bynum had been firm that he would make his debut for Philadelphia, and had targeted the All-Star break for his return. After still not playing through the end of February, it was reported that Bynum's knees had begun to degenerate.\n\nOn March 1, with swelling in his right knee, he conceded he might not play by the end of the season, although he said his left knee was fine. On March 19, Bynum had season-ending arthroscopic surgery on both knees, ending his 76ers tenure without appearing in a game for the franchise.\n\nOn July 19, 2013, Bynum signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Reportedly, the incentive-laden contract could pay him up to $24.79 million over two years. On October 30, 2013, he made his debut for the Cavaliers recording 3 points and 3 rebounds in 8 minutes of play. On November 30, Bynum set season highs of 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a 97–93 victory over the Chicago Bulls. However, he also struggled at times, shooting 0–11 from the field with no points in 22 minutes in a loss to Detroit. On December 28, Bynum was suspended indefinitely by the Cavaliers for conduct detrimental to the team; he had been thrown out of practice after shooting the ball every time he received it, regardless of how far he was from the basket.\n\nOn January 7, 2014, the Cavaliers traded Bynum, a future first round draft pick, two future second round picks, and the option to swap first round picks in 2015 to the Chicago Bulls for Luol Deng. The same day, he was waived by the Bulls in a salary cap move that was projected to save Chicago more than $20 million and provide relief from paying the NBA's luxury tax. During his time with the Cavaliers, Bynum averaged 8.4 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in 20 minutes of play.\n\nOn February 1, 2014, Bynum signed with the Indiana Pacers for the remainder of the season. He was expected to back up All-Star center Roy Hibbert along with Ian Mahinmi. Coach Frank Vogel planned to give Bynum one to two weeks of practice before evaluating if he was ready to play.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Bynum made his Pacers debut with 8 points and 10 rebounds in 15 minutes in a 94–83 win over the Boston Celtics. He appeared in only two games before Indiana declared him out indefinitely with swelling and soreness in his right knee; he missed the remainder of the regular season. On May 7, before Game 2 of the second round of the 2014 NBA playoffs against Washington, the Pacers announced that Bynum would miss the remainder of the season and would no longer be involved in team activities. As late as 2018, Bynum was still working on an attempted NBA comeback.\n\n"}

This has been well described in \"Drosophila\" with respect to eye color and is known as position effect variegation (PEV).\n\nThe phenotype is well characterised by unstable expression of a gene that results in the red eye coloration. In the mutant flies the eyes typically have a mottled appearance of white and red sectors. These phenotypes are often due to a chromosomal translocation such that the color gene is now close to a region of heterochromatin. The heterochromatin can spread stochastically and switch off the color gene resulting in the white eye sectors.\n\n\"Position effect\" is also used to describe the variation of expression exhibited by identical transgenes that insert into different regions of a genome. In this case the difference in expression is often due to enhancers that regulate neighboring genes. These local enhancers can also affect the expression pattern of the transgene. Since each transgenic organism has the transgene in a different location each transgenic organism has the potential for a unique expression pattern.\n"}
{"id": "2142052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142052", "title": "International Mercantile Marine Company", "text": "International Mercantile Marine Company\n\nThe International Mercantile Marine Company, originally the International Navigation Company, was a trust formed in the early twentieth century as an attempt by J.P. Morgan to monopolize the shipping trade. \n\nIMM was founded by shipping magnates Clement Griscom of the American Line and Red Star Line, Bernard N. Baker of the Atlantic Transport Line, J. Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line, and John Ellerman of the Leyland Line. The Dominion Line was also amalgamated. The project was bankrolled by J.P. Morgan & Co., led by financier J. P. Morgan. The company also had working profit-sharing relationships with the German Hamburg-Amerika and the North German Lloyd lines. The trust caused great concern in the British shipping industry and led directly to the British government's subsidy of the Cunard Line's new ships RMS \"Lusitania\" and RMS \"Mauretania\" in an effort to compete.\n\nIMM was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMM's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS \"Titanic\". Analysis of financial records shows that IMM was overleveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow that caused it to default on bond interest payments in late 1914. As a result, a \"friendly\" receivership was put in effect in 1915, which allowed IMM to reorganize its finances; it emerged from the receivership in 1916. Saved by World War I, IMM eventually re-emerged, after a merger with Roosevelt Steamship Company, as the United States Lines, which itself went bankrupt in 1986.\n\nA proposed subsidy bill in the United States Congress failed, as had become widely apparent by April 1902 and the company thus was never really successful. Beginning in the 1920s, the company underwent a series of corporate acquisitions and mergers, which resulted in its becoming the United States Lines in 1943.\n\nAs the shipping industry prospered in the late 19th century, some sought to create a trust that would monopolize U.S. shipping companies. However, all negotiations in this regard in the 1890s fell short. The intervention of John Pierpont Morgan, one of the richest men in the world, would change that.\n\nThe Atlantic Transport Line, owned by Bernard N. Baker and having both passenger and cargo ships, competed intensely with British and other shipping companies. Baker tried to sell his company to John Ellerman, chairman of the cargo-carrying Leyland Line, who had tried unsuccessfully to take possession of the Cunard Line and HAPAG, two powerful European companies. Negotiations between Baker and Ellerman, advanced but ultimately fell through.\n\nMeanwhile, J. P. Morgan had already concluded agreements with Clement Griscom, president of the International Navigation Company, which operated the Red Star Line and the American Line. Finally, in December 1900, after six months of negotiations, the Atlantic Transport Line joined INC.\n\nSubsequently, Baker, J. P. Morgan, and Simon Bettle Jr. (representative of the INC) negotiated with Ellerman, this time with a view to redeem his property. There would be two companies that would join the trust. The name of one of them was revealed in April 1901: the Leyland Line. The second turned out to be the prestigious White Star Line, bought by Morgan's team, after long negotiations, in April 1902. On 1 October 1902, JP Morgan & Co. announced the founding of the International Mercantile Marine Company, more commonly called IMM. (Constituent elements of IMM, including INC (chartered in 1871), had however been operating for many years already.) IMM was incorporated in New Jersey.\n\nMorgan's role evolved over the years. Being American, he could not directly own British ships, but he could own the company that owned the ships. In 1902, the IMM carried 64,738 passengers, a total buoyed by high immigration to the United States. The IMM had signed a partnership with the two most important German shipping companies, Norddeutscher Lloyd and HAPAG, which carried a total of 66,838 passengers. The German-Morgan agreement, signed in New York on 20 February 1902, was a key step in the formation of what was to become the IMM, but did not fully address long-standing competitive friction between and amongst the major German and British transatlantic shipping companies.\n\nResponses in the United Kingdom helped intensify these rivalries. Cunard Line, one of the British shipping companies with independent significance, received grants from the British government for the construction of two great ocean liners, the \"Lusitania\" and the \"Mauretania\", which were placed into service in late 1907. The competitive response from the IMM group came in 1908 when Harland & Wolff was authorized to build the White Star Line's Olympic class ocean liner trio: , , and .\n\nSince 1902, IMM had an agreement with James Pirrie, chairman of Harland & Wolff and member of the management of the White Star Line, stating that the vessels of the company will be built by Harland & Wolff for all the time. Ships of the company were also shifting from one company to another, like the \"Belgic\", built for the White Star Line, which was transferred to the service of the Red Star Line under the name , or the \"Regina\" became the \"Westernland\". This allowed the IMM to schedule a ship each day from the United Kingdom, and passengers to change their tickets to a position equivalent to another vessel of the company. Baker retired from the direction of the Atlantic Transport Line shortly after its integration with the IMM, and was replaced by Philip Franklin. He later became vice president of IMM, while Griscom was replaced as president by Joseph Bruce Ismay in 1904 (who was also president of the White Star Line).\n\nThe early 1910s marked a turning point for the IMM. Indeed, on 15 April 1912, the \"Titanic\", flagship of its fleet, sank during her maiden voyage. Besides the financial and human losses, the sinking had repercussions on the organization of the trust. Through the American commission of inquiry devoted to the sinking, Senator William Alden Smith openly attacked the very principle of the company and Morgan. As had been arranged before Titanic sank, J. Bruce Ismay retired as president of IMM in 1913 and was succeeded by Harold Sanderson Morgan died on 31 March 1913. After the 1915-16 receivership, Sanderson was succeeded as president by Franklin, who had been the receiver.\n\nHowever, the sinking of the \"Titanic\" did not bring about the end of the IMM. Although theoretically powerful due to its continued influence with some of the top American, British, and German shipping companies, the overseeing company never managed to overcome its own financial problems, nor dominate the bulk of the North Atlantic shipping trade, and was therefore not as successful as expected. The company went into receivership in 1915 and was placed in the hands of Franklin, who managed to save it. In the late 1920s, he received grants from the government to American ships (built in the United States or flying the flag) and in 1926 it sold the White Star Line to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company for £7 million, of which £2.35 million was still unpaid when the Royal Mail Group, which was overleveraged and undercapitalized, collapsed in the early 1930s. In 1930, IMM possessed 30 vessels. There were 19 in 1933 and only 11 by 1935.\n\nThe ailing company merged with the Roosevelt Steamship Company, parent company of the Roosevelt Line, in 1931 to form Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine Company (RIMM). Later in 1931, RIMM acquired the financially troubled United States Lines and began consolidating its operations under that brand. The Atlantic Transport Line was dissolved in late 1931 and its ships were distributed throughout RIMM's remaining divisions.\n\nThe American Line was merged into United States Lines in 1932, the Red Star Line was sold to Arnold Bernstein in 1934, Baltimore Mail Line merged into United States Lines in 1937, the Panama Pacific Line was dissolved in 1938 and its ships divested, and American Merchant Line was merged into United States Lines in 1938.\n\nFinally, the Roosevelt Line was merged into United States Lines in 1940, leaving that company as RIMM's only remaining business. RIMM changed its name to United States Lines Inc. in 1943, recasting itself as a smaller company focused exclusively on transatlantic routes under a single brand.\n\nSome businesses of the modern shipping industry still regard IMM as an early attempt at the corporate ownership of several companies under a single trust; the kind of large overseeing companies that dominate much of the maritime shipping world today.\n\n\nCompany became United States Lines Inc, 1943\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2142071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142071", "title": "Blue Bell Creameries", "text": "Blue Bell Creameries\n\nBlue Bell Creameries is an American food company that manufactures ice cream. It was founded in 1907 in Brenham, Texas. For much of its early history, the company manufactured both ice cream and butter locally. In the mid-20th century, it abandoned butter production and expanded to the entire state of Texas and soon much of the Southern United States. The company's corporate headquarters are located at the \"Little Creamery\" in Brenham, Texas. Since 1919, it has been in the hands of the Kruse family. As of 2015, Blue Bell is the number two selling ice cream manufacturer in the United States. \n\nThe company has its roots in the Brenham Creamery Company, which opened in 1907 to purchase excess cream from local dairy farmers and sell butter to people in Brenham, Texas, a town situated approximately 70 miles northwest of Houston. In 1911, the creamery began to produce small quantities of ice cream.\n\nBy 1919, the Creamery was in financial trouble and considered closing its doors. The board of directors hired E.F. Kruse, a 23-year-old former schoolteacher, to take over the company on April 1, 1919. Kruse refused to accept a salary for his first few months in the position so that the company would not be placed in further debt. Under his leadership, the company expanded its production of ice cream to the surrounding Brenham area and soon became profitable. At his suggestion, the company was renamed Blue Bell Creameries in 1930 after the Texas Bluebell, a wildflower native to Texas, and which like ice cream thrives during the summer.\n\nUntil 1936, the creamery made ice cream by the batch. It could create a batch of ice cream every 20 minutes. That same year, in 1936, the company purchased its first continuous ice cream freezer, which could make of ice cream per hour. The ice cream would run through a spigot, allowing it to be poured into any size container.\n\nKruse was diagnosed with cancer in 1951 and died within 8 weeks. His sons Ed and Howard took over leadership of the company. By the 1960s, the company completely abandoned the production of butter and began focusing solely on ice cream. After many years of selling ice cream only in Brenham, the company began selling its ice cream in the Houston area, eventually expanding throughout most of Texas including the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and the state capital of Austin. By the end of the 1970s, sales had quadrupled, and by 1980 the creamery was producing over 10 million gallons (37,850,000 liters) of ice cream per year, earning $30 million annually.\n\nIn 1989, Blue Bell began selling its ice cream in Oklahoma, and throughout the 1990s expansion pushed throughout the South Central and Southern United States, eventually expanding out to New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi. In 1992, Blue Bell built a new manufacturing facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Four years later, in 1996, Blue Bell opened a third manufacturing facility opened in Sylacauga, Alabama, east of Birmingham, and eventually expanded into Atlanta and Miami. Once Blue Bell establishes itself within a market, word-of-mouth usually ensures that consumers in adjacent areas become aware of the brand. Blue Bell has been slow to expand: company executives say they thoroughly research each new market and ensure that all employees in the new markets are fully trained in Blue Bell practices so that product quality can be upheld. Blue Bell often tends to expand to markets during March each year, expanding to Colorado on March 14, 2011, followed by the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas of Virginia in 2013, and Las Vegas in 2014. These expansions are accompanied with the purchase and/or construction of distribution centers in new markets that serve areas within a 75-mile radius.\n\nIn 2015, Blue Bell issued a series of recalls that eventually shut down production and led to all of its products being recalled on April 20, culminating in job cuts and furloughs (as well as the reduction of its 23-state sales territory) resulting from the shutdown the following May. In conjunction with factory cleanup procedures and agreements with state and federal authorities, the company returned to production three months later on a limited basis, returning its products to the market on August 31 in portions of Texas and Alabama as part of a five-phase plan to return to much of its pre-recall distribution territory, which has been reduced to 21 states based on Blue Bell's limited distribution capabilities in the near term.\n\nIn July 2019, The Blue Bell Creameries went viral after a teenage female licked one of their ice cream tubs at a Walmart in Texas, then placed it back in the freezer; she was later arrested. After the incident, multiple copycats were committed, and some were jailed. These incidents resulted with severe negative reactions that violating food in such a manner is dangerous to the public health, along with criticisms that no action is taken to punish any offenders and Blue Bell for not protecting their ice cream with a plastic seal.\n\nAs of 2015, the company operated three manufacturing facilities, with the largest facility in Brenham, and auxiliary facilities in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Sylacauga, Alabama. Before the 2015 recalls, there were 50 sales and distribution centers, known as branches, spread throughout its 23-state market. These facilities employed a combined 2,800 employees, with 850 of the employees working out of Brenham. In 2006, annual sales exceeded $400 million.\n\nBlue Bell retains control over all aspects of its business, primarily to ensure quality control and the use of the freshest ingredients available. The Kruses claim \"the milk we use is so fresh it was grass only yesterday.\" The company uses milk from approximately 60,000 cows each day, and the cream used during each day's production run is always less than 24 hours old. All production and packaging takes place within Blue Bell facilities, which are able to produce over 100 pints per minute. Drivers of delivery vehicles personally stock store shelves so they can ensure it is handled properly.\n\nAccording to figures gathered by Statista, a market data and statistics portal, while combined private labels sold more, in 2014 Blue Bell was the best-selling ice cream brand in the United States. The sales area is primarily concentrated in the Southern United States, and has been sold as far west as Las Vegas, as far north as Indianapolis and Denver, and as far east as Richmond, Virginia. Overall, this area comprises only 20% of the United States. By comparison, each of Blue Bell's top four competitors sells its products in 100% of the United States. To become one of the three biggest ice cream manufacturers, Blue Bell has consistently been the top seller in the majority of the markets the company has entered. For example, in its home state of Texas, the company has a 52% market share. Within five months of its entry into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company had garnered 35% of the ice cream market. People living outside the sales area can have the ice cream shipped to them (although this has temporarily been halted while the company is ramping up production after the recalls), and former President George W. Bush (a former Governor of Texas) often had the ice cream shipped to Camp David during his administration. In 2006 and 2012, astronauts aboard the International Space Station were also treated to Blue Bell ice cream \"to help out (the crew's) happiness quotient.\"\n\nBlue Bell has been quoted by \"Bon Appétit\"' magazine as \"the proudest\" \"natural\" resource \"as a Texan\".\n\nBlue Bell produces over 250 different frozen products. Of these, 66 are flavors of ice cream. Twenty of the flavors are offered year-round, while an additional two to three dozen are offered seasonally. In addition to ice cream, the company produces frozen yogurt, sherbet, and an array of frozen treats on a stick. Unlike competitors which have reduced their standard containers to 48-56 fluid ounces (1.42-1.66 L), Blue Bell continues to sell true half-gallon (64 fl oz/1.89 L) containers, a fact it mentions prominently in its advertising.\n\nBlue Bell introduced its flagship flavor, Homemade Vanilla, in 1969 and was the first company to mass-produce the flavor Cookies 'n Cream. Although the company at one time made Cookies 'n Cream from Nabisco's Oreo cookies, buying ordinary retail packages, today it bakes its own cookies. As of 1997, Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla was the best-selling single flavor of ice cream in the United States, and in 2001, \"Forbes\" named Blue Bell the best ice cream in the country.\n\nR.W. Apple, Jr., of \"The New York Times\" claimed in 2006 that \"[w]ith clean, vibrant flavors and a rich, luxuriant consistency achieved despite a butterfat content a little lower than some competitors, it hooks you from the first spoonful. Entirely and blessedly absent are the cloying sweetness, chalky texture, and oily, gummy aftertaste that afflict many mass-manufactured ice creams.\"\n\nOccasionally, when Blue Bell enters a market the company marks the occasion with the introduction of a regional flavor within that market. For example, when it entered Colorado on March 14, 2011, Blue Bell introduced a new flavor exclusive to Colorado, Rocky Mountain Road, made with more premium ingredients (including chocolate-covered nuts and a marshmallow swirl) compared to its year-round Rocky Road. While the test market was in the Denver metropolitan area, there was speculation that the rest of the state would soon see Blue Bell on store shelves. Eventually, this flavor would be distributed to Blue Bell's entire sales territory.\n\nIn 2018, children of an interracial family posted an open letter on Facebook addressed to Blue Bell asking that the flavor \"The Great Divide\" (equal halves of chocolate and vanilla) be changed to \"Better Together\". While Blue Bell spokespersons reacted positively to the name change proposal, the post became controversial among some Facebook users who dismissed the original name as inoffensive.\n\nIn 2015, Blue Bell issued its first recall in its 108-year history. The recall was issued on an assortment of items produced at its creameries, due to the discovery of five cases of listeriosis in Kansas believed to be caused by products produced at its creamery in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Three of the five patients with listeria died.\n\nDespite a series of subsequent recalls, and the temporary shutdown of its Broken Arrow plant, \"an enhanced sampling program\" launched by Blue Bell produced \"several positive tests for Listeria in different places and plants\", including three further cases in Texas. As a result, on the evening of April 20, 2015 the company took precautionary measures and expanded its recall to cover all of its products—a recall of over eight million gallons, to be disposed of in a sanitary landfill.\n\nAt the same time, the company shut down production and commenced cleanup and repair operations at its manufacturing facilities. The FDA found that the company failed to follow standard practices to prevent contamination; two years prior to the recalls, the company \"repeatedly found listeria\" in its Broken Arrow facility. At its main production facility in Brenham, one of its production machines (which produced most of the recalled products) was so contaminated that Blue Bell announced it would permanently stop using the machine, and condensation was also reported in parts of the Brenham facility.\n\nAlthough a spokeswoman for Blue Bell had previously demurred on the subject of job losses, on May 15, Blue Bell announced a series of job cuts and furloughs. 1,450 (or 37 percent) of the company's employees would be laid off, while another 1,400 employees were furloughed until cleanup/repair operations concluded, and the remaining 1,050 involved in essential operations and cleanup/repair operations had wage reductions imposed on them.\n\nIn addition, due to limited supply and distribution capabilities expected in the near term, Blue Bell announced it would suspend operations at 15 of its over 50 distribution centers indefinitely, though it has not ruled out returning to these markets eventually. The affected distribution centers included:\nThe recalls were so severe that they threatened to shut down the company; executives warned shareholders that they faced a \"capital crisis.\" On July 14, 2015, Sid Bass, a prominent Texas investor, became a partner and investor with the company; Blue Bell secured a $125 million loan to continue operations. Around the same time, Blue Bell's plant in Sylacauga, Alabama resumed production, creating test batches as part of a \"test and hold\" procedure in which ice cream is not packaged for sale until the batch tests negative for all strains of bacteria including the strain of listeria responsible for the aforementioned recalls.\n\nOn August 17, 2015, Blue Bell announced a five-phase plan to return to store shelves:\nEven in those states where Blue Bell plans to return, it will not necessarily return to all of its pre-recall markets by the final phase. Those markets, including Charlotte, Kansas City, Louisville & Phoenix, were added based on the fact that Blue Bell will effectively service those areas. For now, Wichita, KS & Las Vegas, NV have yet to return.\n\nPhase 1 began on August 31, 2015. Phase 2 began in November, 2015. A month later phases 3 and 4 began.\n\nThe day following its initial rollout, September 1, Blue Bell resumed production at its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma facility.\n\nOn January 28, 2016, the company resumed distribution to large portions of the Southeastern US.\n\nOn March 6, 2017, Blue Bell reopened the three distribution centers located in Tucson (1), and Phoenix (2) to complete distribution across the state of Arizona.\n\nIn March 2018, the company began distribution to much of Indiana, midsection of Kentucky & northern New Mexico.\n\nIn March 2019, the company resumed distribution to much of the Virginia area, northeastern North Carolina & greater Kansas City.\n\nIn December 2015, \"CBS Evening News\" reported that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had launched a federal criminal investigation into Blue Bell Creameries, to determine \"what exactly Blue Bell executives knew about the contaminations and unsanitary conditions, when they knew, and what they did in response\". The investigation, by the DOJ's Consumer Protection Branch, is reportedly led by trial attorney Patrick Hearn, who successfully prosecuted executives of the Peanut Corporation of America in 2015. Mark Abueg, a DOJ spokesman, told the \"Houston Press\": \"As a matter of policy, the Justice Department generally neither confirms nor denies whether a matter is under investigation.\"\n\n\n"}

Cadena temporal included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance. Cadena perpetua is identical except that it is a sentence of life as opposed to a temporary status.\n\nThe \"title\" of the punishment is actually descriptive, as \"cadena\" is a Spanish word meaning chain while temporal means impermanent or temporary, in addition to the meaning it shares with English and \"perpetua\", means continuous in Latin and Spanish.\n\nOne of the places these punishments were provided for was the Philippine legal system. This was a result of the Spanish Penal Code of 1870, which was adopted due to the country having been a Spanish colony until 1898. Cadena temporal was among the penalties repealed in 1932 with the enactment of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines.\n\nThe use of this colonial punishment has been reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Weems v. United States\", 217 U.S. 349 (1910). Derived from the Spanish penal Code, the punishment of \"cadena temporal\" was from twelve years and one day to twenty years (arts. 28 and 96), which 'shall be served' in certain 'penal institutions.' And it was provided that 'those sentenced to cadena temporal (and cadena perpetua) shall labor for the benefit of the state. They shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists; they shall be employed at hard and painful labor, and shall receive no assistance whatsoever from without the institution.' There were, besides, certain accessory penalties imposed with it.\n\nIn Weems, the Supreme Court ruled this punishment to be \"cruel and unusual\" for a crime of \"corruptly, and with intent then and there to deceive and defraud the United States government of the Philippine Islands and its officials, falsify[ing] a public and official document.\" \"Weems v. United\" States breaks away with the \"historic method\" of interpretation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting such penalties. It thus paves the way to a modern interpretation of the Bill of Rights based on a new criterion: the \"evolving standards of decency of a maturing society\" designed by the Supreme Court in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1957) .\n"}
{"id": "2142092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142092", "title": "Linguistic purism", "text": "Linguistic purism\n\nLinguistic purism or linguistic protectionism is the prescriptive practice of defining or recognizing one variety of a language as being purer or of intrinsically higher quality than other varieties. Linguistic purism was institutionalized through language academies (of which the 1572 Accademia della Crusca set a model example in Europe), and their decisions often have the force of law.\n\nThe perceived or actual decline identified by the purists may take the form of change of vocabulary, syncretism of grammatical elements, or loanwords. The unwanted similarity is often with a neighboring language whose speakers are culturally or politically dominant. The abstract ideal may invoke logic, clarity, or the grammar of \"classic\" languages. It is often presented as conservative, as a \"protection\" of a language from the \"aggression\" of other languages or of \"conservation\" of the national Volksgeist, but is often innovative in defining a new standard. It is sometimes part of governmental language policy which is enforced in various ways.\n\nThe practice opposite of purism, when borrowed words displace native ones, also exist. For example, in English the native word 'bookstaff' was replaced by borrowed word 'letter'.\n\nIn one common case, two closely related languages or language varieties are in direct competition, one weaker, the other stronger. Speakers of the stronger language may characterize the weaker language as a \"dialect\" of the strong language, with the implication that it has no independent existence. In response, defenders of the other language will go to great lengths to prove that their language is equally autonomous.\n\nIn this context, Yiddish and Dutch have in the past sometimes been considered dialects of German. In the case of Low German, spoken in eastern Netherlands and northern Germany, the debate is still current, as it could be considered a dialect of Dutch or German or a language of its own. An example of a related language that has only recently attained the status of an official national language is Luxembourgish. Since linguistic science offers no scholarly definition of a dialect, and linguists regard the distinction with scepticism – see A language is a dialect with an army and navy – the argument is really about subjective questions of identity politics, and at times it can invoke extreme emotions from the participants.\n\nClosely related languages often tend to mix. One way of preventing this is to use different writing systems or different spelling systems.\n\nExamples of this include:\n\nVarious scholars have devised classifications of purism. These classifications take different criteria as their starting point and are therefore partly independent of each other.\n\n\nThis classification of puristic orientations made by George Thomas represents ideal forms. In practice, though, these orientations are often combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

RēR features largely \"Rock in Opposition\" and related music, but it also distributes selected music released on other independent labels.\n\nIn 1982 Cutler established November Books, the publishing wing of Recommended Records, and between 1985 and 1997, Recommended Records and November Books published \"RēR Quarterly\", a \"quarterly\" sound-magazine edited by Cutler.\n\nIn 1989 Recommended Records became known as RēR Megacorp with a turnover of £180,000 in 1994.\n\nWhen English avant-rock group Henry Cow toured Europe between 1975 and 1977 they encountered many bands in a similar situation to their own: they were forced to operate outside the music industry that refused to recognise their music. In 1978 these groups got together and formed Rock in Opposition (RIO). To provide a record label and distribution network for these artists, Chris Cutler of Henry Cow and Nick Hobbs, Henry Cow's manager at the time, established Recommended Records (RēR) as a model for a non-profit music company. When RIO folded as an organisation in late 1979, RēR continued RIO's work by representing and promoting marginalised musicians and groups. RēR became a \"virtual RIO\", and \"part of the continuing legacy of RIO\".\n\nRecommended Records grew from \"Ré\", a private record label in 1978 to \"RēR Megacorp\" in 1989, an internationally recognised independent record company with distributors worldwide. They have consistently introduced new and interesting artists from around the world, many of whom might never have been able to release records. They have always put the artist first and commercial viability second.\n\nWhen Henry Cow split up in 1978, Chris Cutler created a record label called Ré for his own projects with a distribution arm called Recommended Distribution, so called because he personally \"recommended\" the titles they distributed. The intention was to import and distribute new, interesting and experimental music from all over the world to the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1979, Cutler established the Recommended label for releases other than his own. In 1987, he combined the Ré and Recommended labels to form RēR, and at the same time Recommended Distribution became a worker's cooperative enabling Cutler to concentrate on running the RéR label and writing RēR's mail order catalogue. This arrangement worked for a few years, but in 1989, due to enormous unpaid debts from Recommended Distribution, Cutler was forced to restart his own distribution system again, and RēR became RēR/Recommended. Recommended Distribution went on to become These Records, an affiliated label. RēR/Recommended became known as RēR Megacorp with a website and online shopping facilities.\n\nJust as Recommended Records's name evolved over the years, so did its logo.

Prior to her election to the U.S. House of Representatives, English served as an Arizona State Senator (1991–1993), State Representative (1987–1991), and Coconino County supervisor (1981–1987). In the Arizona senate, English developed a reputation as a liberal on fiscal, social and environmental issues.\n\nDespite being heavily outspent during her campaign, English won her 1992 General Election race against Republican Doug Wead after being endorsed by former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. Goldwater said he thought Wead was out of touch with Arizona because of his relatively brief residency in the state—two years to English's 22. Wead countered that Goldwater's support of abortion rights spurred the unexpected crossing of party lines. English may have also benefited from Democratic Party momentum in 1992, which was the year of Bill Clinton's first presidential election victory. Clinton came within a few percentage points of winning Arizona, and two other Democratic Representatives (Ed Pastor and Sam Coppersmith) were elected along with English to give Democrats the majority of the state's House delegation.\n\nShe was the second woman to represent Arizona in Congress, with Isabella Selmes Greenway (1933–1937) being the first.\n\nAfter serving a single term in Congress, English was defeated by Republican challenger J.D.

The program premiered on June 26, 2005 and ended with its three-season run when it was cancelled on May 1, 2007.\n\nThe show features Milonakis as well as a supporting cast made up of his actual neighbors and people from the Lower East Side, Manhattan neighborhood where the show originally took place. There is no plot and the comedy in the sketches tends to be absurdist and silly. Despite its time slot and intended audience, the content is rated TV PG. There are often animated segments, and often man-on-the-street segments. The last sketch of the show usually involves a celebrity guest. In the third and final season, Milonakis moved to Los Angeles to be with his now famous pet turtle, Herbie. His best friend, Ralphie, sneaks along and moves with him. Ralphie made their old friends into household items so they could be with Andy too. However, they played significantly smaller roles than in the prior two seasons.\n\nThe first two seasons, filmed in New York City, each consisted of eight episodes. The main cast consisted of Andy, Ralphie, Larry and Rivka. Billy, who was seen in only a few bits in the first season, became a cast member for season two. Andy was always seen in his trademark red plaid button-down shirt for these two seasons.\n\nThe third season consisted of six episodes. Andy moves to Los Angeles, and begins wearing a blue plaid button-down shirt, given to him by Ralphie, who had been wearing it under his arm \"to stop the sweat.\" Ralphie is the only original cast member to join Andy for season three, but is able to bring along the remaining cast as household items. He turned Larry into a can opener, mounted Rivka's head and put Billy's soul on his shoe.\n\nSeason two introduced a cartoon show-within-a-show called \"The Lower East Side Dysfunctional Monster Gang Squad Family Cartoon Show.\" For season three, the title remained the same, albeit adding \"In L.A.\" at the end. Andy provided the voices of Handsome Pig, Vicious Critter and Baby Dracula. Ralphie voiced Hairmouth, Rivka voiced Eyemouth Susie, Larry voiced Acid Reflux Charlie and Billy voiced Not-So-Human Stick.\n\nSeason three also introduced a new theme song, with Andy rapping about his move to Los Angeles, while making references to lines from the original theme song (\"Peas on my head,\" \"Bees on my head,\" e.g.).\n\n"}

This fact was due most probably to the situation of the Rio de Quingua Angat River, which directly connects the town of Quingua, a community then located in the center of vast lands, covering plains and mountains alike.\n\nAugustinian missionaries built a small \"visita\" (chapel) under the Parochial ministry of Paroquia de Santiago Matamoro de Quingua. In 1683 the \"visita\" of Angat made a Town Church and the whole Angat where established as a new Pueblo.\n\nToday, still stands and legible, is the inscription at the façade of her church with a Roman Numeral \"MDCCXII\" translated to \"1727\" a year indicating the date of the erection the Angat Church's present building.\n\nThe towns of San Rafael, Bulacan and Bustos, Bulacan bound the town of Angat on the North.

Angat River's main basin of water resource is from \"Sierra Madre Mountain Range\" (the longest mountain range in the Philippines) in Luzon island. During increment climate condition like continuous rainy days for days the water inundates to different river tributaries in its adjoining municipalities, as well as provinces through different rivers. To the southeast are 2 rivers: \"Santa Maria River\" of Santa Maria, Bulacan. \"Bunsuran River\" of Pandi, Bulacan. \"Balagtas River\" of Balagtas, Bulacan, and \"Bocaue River\" of Bocaue, Bulacan.\n\nAngat's mountainous and hilly area has abundance of trees that are source of timber and wood materials, and unfortunately become an area of illegal logging. The mountainous areas, and lands close to the river shore, some of which are privately owned is rich in mineral deposit of silica. The vast area around Angat River is very high source of rocks and pebbles used for construction and garden landscaping.\n\nMost areas have a very relaxing atmosphere of greenery seen in mountain heights and river shore lines where some fresh water fishes also multiplies.\n\nThe prevailing climatic conditions in the municipality is categorized into two (2) types: Wet season (Rainy Season or Monsoon Season) and Dry Season (Summer Season).\n\nAngat is subdivided into 16 barangays:\n\nIn the , the population of Angat, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe people of Angat are mostly devout Catholics. Their patron saint is Saint Monica. It displays baroque architecture, with its interior replicating the Sistine Chapel, recently remodeled but preserving its old architecture. In 1983, the Parish of the town celebrated its Tricentennial Foundation. Today, Angat has already Three Catholic Parishes within the town — the Saint Paul the Apostle Parish in Barangay Niugan, the Santa Rita de Cascia Parish in Barangay Binagbag, and the Santa Monica Parish in Poblacion.\n\nOther religious groups include the Members Church of God International popularly known as Ang Dating Daan, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Jehovah's Witness, Methodists, Aglipayans, Adventists, Baptists, Mormons. There also some Evangelical, Pentecostal, Charismatic churches, ministries, fellowships and religious groups. Islam (Muslims) could also be found.\n\nCouncilors of Angat:\n\nThe Angateños consider education as very important. It was the dream of many that there would be a Catholic school in Angat. This dream was realized in 1983 through the initiative and leadership of the founding members of the first Board of Trustees of Santa Monica Catholic School, Inc.: Bishop Cirilio R. Almario, Jr., Rev. Fr. Macario R. Manahan, Councilor Manuel C. De Guzman, Mrs. Angelita A. Cruz, Mr. Francisco C. Robles.\nThrough a memorandum of agreement between the Ministry of Social Services and Development and the Parents' Committee, the Day Care Center became Santa Monica Catholic Learning Center.\nIn 1985, the school was renamed Santa Monica Catholic School and given the permit to open and conduct Grade VI. The first batch of Grade VI graduates received their diplomas in March 1986.\n\nOn March 27, 1987, the high school department was formally opened. A year later, the school's name was changed to Colegio de Santa Monica de Angat to reflect the town's Hispanic heritage. In the same year, the St. Joseph Building was inaugurated. The first batch graduated in March 1990. Today, the school's population and physical structure continues to grow.\n\nAs a predominantly Roman Catholic Christian community, every barangay has their own unique way of celebrating fiestas in honor of their respective patron saint. In the town proper where the old beautiful church of Angat is located, the locals celebrate their fiesta every 4 May in honor of its patron St. Monica, mother of St. Augustine.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBaliuag was founded in 1732 by Augustinian friars and was incorporated by the Spanish Governor-General on May 26, 1733. The town was a part of Quingua (now Plaridel) before.\n\nThrough the years of Spanish domination, Baliuag was predominantly agricultural. People had to depend on rice farming for main source of livelihood. Orchards and \"tumanas\" yielded fruits and vegetables, which were sold in the public market. Commerce and industry also played important contributions to the economy of the people. Buntal hat weaving in Baliuag together with silk weaving popularly known in the world as Thai silk; the manufacturer of cigar cases, piña fibers, petates (mats) and Sillas de Bejucos (cane chairs) all of fine quality became known in many parts of the world. The local market also grew. During the early part of the 19th century Baliuag was already considered one of the most progressive and richest town in Bulacan. The growth of the public market has significantly changed the mode of economy of the town.\n\nBaliuag is the major commerce, transportation, entertainment and educational center of Northern Bulacan. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's built up area which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part.\n\nFr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga, OSA, a friar, in his \"1803 Historia de las Islas Filipinas\" wrote that the Convent or Parochial house of San Agustin, in Baliuag, is the best in the whole Archipelago and that no edifice in Manila can be compared to it in symmetry and beauty amid its towering belfry, having been a viewing point of the town's panorama. The frayle further stated that the Convent was a repository of priceless parish records which dated to the founding of Baliuag as a \"pueblo\" or \"parrochia\" by the OSA or Augustinians in 1733. But the first convent was erected at Barangay Santa Barbara, Baliuag before the Parokya was formally established at the now Plaza Naning, Poblacion.\n\nFr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga arrived in the Philippines on August 3, 1786 and visited Baliuag on February 17, 1802 with Ignacio Maria de Álava y Sáenz de Navarrete. Their host was Baliuag's Parish Priest, Fray Esteban Diez Hidalgo. Fr. Diez served as the longest \"cura parroco\" of Baliuag from 1789, having built the church and convent from 1790 to 1801.\n\nSpanish records \"Apuntes históricos de la provincia augustiniana del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús de Filipinas\" reveal that Fr. Juan de Albarran, OSA was assigned Parish Priest of Baliuag in 1733. The first baptism in Baliuag Church was ordered by Fr. Lector and Fr. Feliz Trillo, Provincial of the Province on June 7, 1933 while Baliuag was founded and began its de jure existence on May 26, 1733. The \"pueblo\" or town was created in the provincial Chapter on May 15, 1734, with the appointment of Fr. Manuel Bazeta/Baseta as first \"cura parroco\".\n\nIn 1769-1774, the Church of Baliuag was built by Father Gregorio Giner. The present structure (the third church to be rebuilt, due to considerable damage during the 1880 Luzon earthquakes) was later rebuilt by Father Esteban Diaz using mortar and stone. The 1866 Belfry was also completed by Father Matias Novoa but the July 19, 1880 quake damaged the same which was later repaired by Father Thomas Gresa.\n\nThe earthquake of June 3, 1863, one of the strongest to ever hit Manila, destroyed the Governor's Palace in Intramuros. Malacañang then, became the permanent residence of the head of the country. The massive quake also damaged the Baliuag Church. In 1870, the reconstruction began when a temporary house of worship, the “Provincial”, along Año 1733 street, emerged as a narrow, and simple edifice which later used by the RVM Sisters of the Colegio de la Sagrada Familia (now St. Mary's College of Baliuag) as classroom. Antonio de Mesa, “Maestrong Tonio\" fabricated the parts to have finished the Spanish-era Baliuag Church.\n\nBaliuag had 30 curates (1733–1898): Fr. Esteban Diez Hidalgo and Fr. Fausto Lopez served 40 and 24 years, respectively. Fr. Lopez had 6 children with a beautiful native, Mariquita: Dr. Joaquin Gonzalez, Francisco, the former Assemblyman Ricardo Lloret Gonzales (Legislative districts of Bulacan, 5th Philippine Legislature), and Jose the eldest who was widely known as “Pepeng Mariquita\", inter alia. Spanish \"cura parroco\", Fr. Ysidoro Prada served in Baliuag during the last decade of Spaniard regime.\n\nThe Philippine-American civil and military authorities supervised the first municipal elections, having chosen Baliuag as the site of the first Philippine elections of May 7, 1899. The Filipinos gathered at the plaza of the St. Augustine Church after the Holy Mass, and thereafter the officials were selected based on the qualifications for voters set by the Americans.\n\nThe first town \"Gobernadorcillo\" (1789 title) of Baliuag was Cap. Jose de Guzman. He was assisted by the Tribunal's \"teniente mayor\" (chief lieutenant), \"juez de ganadas\" (judge of the cattle), \"juez de sementeras\" (judge of the field) and \"juez de policia\" (judge of the police). In the History of the Philippines (1521–1898), the 1893 Maura Law, the title of \"Gobernadorcillo\" became \"capitan municipal\" and that of each \"juez\" to \"teniente\". From Baliuag's independence from Quingua, now Plaridel, Bulacan to 1898, 49 served as \"capitan\", 13 \"alcalde\" and 92 as \"Gobernadorcillo\". Felix de Lara (1782) and Agustin de Castro (1789) were the 1st \"alcalde\" and \"Gobernadorcillo\", respectively. Municipal President Fernando Enrile, in 1908, honored some of these officials, even naming some of Baliuag \"calles\" in their honor, later. But all these political officials remained under the thumbs and the habito, of the autocratic Augustinian friars, the Baliuag Kura Parokos.\n\nThe local government of Baliuag used as first Municipio under the American regime (History of the Philippines (1898–1946)) the Mariano Yoyongko (Gobernadorcillo in 1885) Principalia in Poblacion (now a part of the market site), which it bought from Yoyongko.\n\nOn September 15, 1915, Baliuag municipality bought the heritage mansion and lot of Dr. Joaquin Gonzalez. The Gonzalez old mansion served as \"Lumang Municipio\" (the Old Municipio or Town Hall Building, as seat of the local government) for 65 years. It is now the Baliuag Museum and Library.\n\nBaliuag produced not less than 30 priests, including 3 during the Spanish-Dominican, and 2 Jesuits during the American regimes.\n\nJeorge Allan R. Tengco and Amy R. Tengco (wife of Lito S. Tengco), philanthropists, owners of Baliwag Transit and other chains of business establishments had been conferred the Papal Orders of Chivalry October 3, 2000 Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice and the 2012 Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great awards.\n\nMariano Ponce was a native of Baliwag. He was a founding member of the Propaganda Movement together with José Rizal and Marcelo del Pilar; a former assemblyman of the second district of Bulacan to the Philippine Assembly; and the co-founder of \"La Solidaridad\" with fellow co-founder Graciano López-Jaena. His most common names are Naning (the Plaza Naning in Baliwag being named after his nickname); Kalipulako, named after the Cebuano hero Lapu-Lapu; and Tagibalang or Tigbalang (Tikbalang), a supernatural being in Filipino folklore.\n\nBaliwag is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Baliuag, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nBaliuag at present has five parishes, a sub-parish and a quasi-parish under the administration of Diocese of Malolos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuntal Hat Festival is a celebration of culture of buntal hat making in the town that is simultaneously celebrated with Mother's Day annually. Colorful and grandiose decorations and street dancing are the highlights of this celebration.\n\n\nPublic transportation in Baliuag is served by provincial buses, jeepneys, UV Express AUVs, and intra-municipal tricycles.\n\nBaliwag Transit, Inc., one of the largest bus transportation system in the Philippines, is headquartered in Barangay Sabang. It mainly services routes to and from Metro Manila and Central Luzon.\n\nThere are three (3) major transport lines in the municipality: The Baliuag-Candaba (Benigno S. Aquino Avenue) road going to Pampanga (from the Downtown Baliuag to Candaba Town Proper), the Old Cagayan Valley road (Calle Rizal) and the Dona Remedios Trinidad Highway (N1, AH26) going to Manila and Nueva Ecija. The town is located 52 kilometers north of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.\n\nBaliuag has several private colleges and universities. \n\n\n\n"}

The MacArthur Highway bisects the municipality of Balagtas as this national road cuts northward to the Ilocos region. At the southern approach of the town from Manila is a concrete bridge that crosses the Balagtas River. The river, navigable by banca and motor boats, empties into Manila bay after snaking through the town of Bulacan to the West which provides Balagtas' townsfolk with fish, shrimp, and other fresh water food.\n\nAt the foot of the bridge, along the highway towards the North, is the town hall. In front of the town hall is a park where the monument of its hero, Francisco \"Balagtas\" Baltazar is located. The town hall is surrounded by Spanish colonial type houses. Two hundred meters from the municipal hall is the barrio of Panginay, the birthplace of Francisco Balagtas, for whom also \"Balagtasan\", a form of debate in versified Tagalog, was named. In 1946 the Historical Society of the Philippines placed a marker at the birthplace of Balagtas. In reverence to the hero's deeds, the official name of Bigaa was changed to Balagtas through the legislative act sponsored by then Congressman, Teodulo Natividad.\n\nOriginally known as Caruya/Caluya as per as the history records regarding the early years of the establishment of Bulacan Province, Caruya was one of the Encomiendas of the vast region La Pampanga falls under the Alcalde Mayor of Bulacan. Encomienda de Caruya was Encomienda of the King of Spain which appeared in Miguel de Loarca's Relacion delas Isla Filipinas in 1582 and the Report of Governor- General Luis Perez de Dasmariñas of June 21, 1591 document.

The Catalogo of 1591 indicates the existence of Guiguinto y Caruyan with 4,800 souls and it was administered by a religious from Bulacan Convent. In 1608 Historia dela Provincia Agustiana mentioned Caruyan as pueblo and convent.\nThe Catalogo of 1612 says that Caruyan had 2 sacerdos, 800 Tributos, 2,400 Almas. (Historia de La Provincia Agustiana del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas\nVol.1 of Isacio Rodriguez OSA)\n\nOn other data, the Center for Bulacan Studies in their \"La Primera Provincia\" published in 2010 p. 138 mentioned that Bigaa came from Malolos as its matrix with a date independency date of 1621. It could be assumed that Bigaa was later transferred to Malolos Convent in uncertain date but La Primera did not mention that Bigaa originally came from Bulakan town but instead in Malolos.\n\nLong time before the construction of the church at Poblacion, the original location of the town center where the hermitage and the base of Spanish instruction in Bigaa was at Barrio Dalig where Sitio Caruyan was located.\n\nIt is very unclear when Caruya was formally organized into administrative town with its own Gobernadorcillo.

In a hypertonic environment, the cell has a lower concentration of solutes than the surrounding extracellular fluid, and water diffuses out of the cell by osmosis, causing the cytoplasm to decrease in volume. As a result, the cell shrinks and the cell membrane develops abnormal notchings. Pickling cucumbers and salt-curing of meat are two practical applications of crenation.\n\nPlasmolysis is the term which describes plant cells when the cytoplasm shrinks from the cell wall in a hypertonic environment. In plasmolysis, the cell wall stays intact, but the plasma membrane shrinks and the chloroplasts of the plant cell concentrate in the center of the cell. \n\nCrenation is also used to describe a feature of red blood cells. These erythrocytes look as if they have projections extending from a smaller central area, like a spiked ball. The crenations may be either large, irregular spicules of acanthocytes, or smaller, more numerous, regularly irregular projections of echinocytes. Acanthocytes and echinocytes may arise from abnormalities of the cell membrane lipids or proteins, or from other disease processes, or as an ex vivo artifact.\n\n\n"}

Because of this, the Cash-on-Cash return would be a lower figure which would be determined by dividing the NOI after all mortgage payment expenses were deducted from it, by the total cash invested. \n\nFor example: If the investor made total mortgage payments (principal+interest) of $2,000 a month in this scenario, then the Cash-on-Cash investment would be as follows:\n$2,000x12= $24,000.\n$60,000-$24,000= $36,000.\nformula_3.\n\n\nIt is possible to perform an after-tax Cash on Cash calculation, but accurate depictions of your adjusted taxable income are needed to correctly address how much tax payment is being saved through depreciation and other losses.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nWith the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Bustos is now included in the Greater Manila's built-up conurbation area which reaches San Ildefonso, Bulacan at its northernmost part.\n\nBustos was a part of the town of Baliuag as its barrio during the Spanish Period. The town was separated from Baliuag by a tragic incident when around 1860, during a rainy Sunday, a group of natives from Bustos with babies in their arms were on their way to St. Augustine Parish Church of Baliuag for baptismal when they drowned after the \"planceta\" or raft they were riding accidentally capsized while crossing the wild river of Angat due to the strong water current. This fateful event led the people of Bustos to request and build their own parish church to avoid the crossings in the wild river for community safety. The locals chose Holy Child Jesus (\"Santo Niño\") as their patron saint in honor of those infants that died in the river.\n\nBustos also gained its independence from Baliuag in April 29, 1867 through the painstaking efforts and sacrifices of its inhabitants with the integration of barrios Bonga Mayor and Bonga Menor.\n\nThe town got its name from Jose Pedro Perez de Busto[s], a mining engineer from Villaviciosa, Asturias, Spain, served as the right-hand of Simón de Anda y Salazar, and was appointed \"teniente general alcalde\" (Provincial Governor) of Bulacan.\n\nBustos became a distinct municipality on January 1, 1916 during the Philippine Assembly through 4th Philippine Legislature Assemblyman Ricardo Lloret Gonzalez. A year after, the town inaugurated its municipal hall on January 1, 1917. Leon Prado became its first Municipal Mayor and served from 1917 to 1919. Padre Gabriel Alvarez served as the first parish priest of the institutionalized Santo Niño de Bustos Parish Church.\n\nThe town became a part of Baliuag again during the American period. At the time, Bustos also became a part of the historical World War II in the Philippines and served as the military headquarters of soldiers in the province of Bulacan during the war in 1945 being led by Bustosenyo then Capt. Alejo Santos.\n\nWith the theme \"Bustos Sentenaryo : Isang Daan tungo sa Ikasandaan\", Bustos celebrated its 100th year founding anniversary in 2017 in the same time with the Santo Niño de Bustos Parish Church's 150th year founding anniversary as an independent parish church of the municipality. The Philippine Postal Corporation made a special commemorative stamp for the centennial anniversary celebration of the town.\n\nBustos is located at the center of five adjoining towns of Bulacan Province: San Rafael on the north; Pandi and Plaridel on the south; Baliuag on the west; and Angat on the east.\n\nThe land areas are mostly rice fields devoted for planting crops and agricultural products. Some farmlands of the town are covered by irrigation systems of National Irrigation Administration coming from Bustos Dam and Angat Dam on the Angat River.\n\nBustos is subdivided into the following fourteen barangays (six urban, eight rural).\n\nIn the , the population of Bustos, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nBustos has two parishes under the administration of the Diocese of Malolos, Santo Niño de Bustos Parish Church and San Isidro Labrador Parish Church.\n\nOther Christian religious groups, such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jesus is Lord Church, Ang Dating Daan, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses and other Protestant groups can be found in the municipality.\n\nPeople in Bustos celebrate a number of Catholic holidays throughout the year. The first church in Bustos has been dedicated to Santo Niño, the Holy Child Jesus, and there is a feast that is held in memory every third Sunday of January, where the townspeople celebrate it with music and dance while holding images of Santo Niño decorated with flowers and lights with parade of floats with images of the saint (locally known as \"Tugyaw\").\n\nBustos is an agricultural town in majority. In fact, it is hailed as one of the largest rice producers of the country and the Central Luzon Region, the \"Rice Granary of the Philippines\", and received the Rice Achiever Award as Outstanding Municipality in Region III and Hall of Fame award at Agri-Pinoy Rice Achievers Award of 2014 conferred by the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe Bustos commercial center in the town proper is still expanding with the influx of more business investors willing to venture in this small but flourishing town. In the present, the town has its public and few small private markets, business shops, banks, convenience stores, restaurants, cafeterias, and grocery stores.\n\nBustos has their own trademark product, the finger food 'Minasa'.\n\nMinasa refers to \"cassava cookies\", made from cassava flour, egg yolk, yeast, butter, and coco milk. It is somehow compared to \"Uraro\", another local delicacy. It is one of the famous treats from the province of Bulacan which is traded in local and global market of Filipino \"pasalubong\" products. Way back Spanish colonization era here in the Philippines, these Minasa cookies were made of sago (arrowroot) starch and not cassava. The main ingredient was changed because of the long production time of sago starch and cassava starch is cheaper and easier to produce. Also, these were exclusively produced and eaten by the elite Bulakeños for they are the only ones who can afford the ingredients and had the equipment for the production of it. The word \"minasa\" in English is \"molded\". The process of preparing Minasa is like making and baking cookies. The only thing special about Minasa is its shape which is molded on specially-made wooden molders with intricate designs, commonly floral designs, and it is baked in a \"hurno\" or a brick stone oven which adds to the yumminess of the cookie. Minasa is said to be a part of history and culture of Bulacan because of those egg yolks that were left in building old stone houses that were made of egg whites. Currently, there are stalls all around Bustos selling this very delicious local delicacy making the municipality hailed as the \"Home of Minasa\".\nBustos has a rural bank, the Rural Bank of Bustos, which is located at Gen. Alejo Santos Highway, Barangay Bonga Menor, beside the Bustos by-pass road going to Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija. It has a branch in Barangay Poblacion in front of Santo Niño Hospital.

It features the cookie \"minasa\", a locally-made delicacy as well as other items such as the dry-like wafer crispy \"barquillos\". The festival was first celebrated in 2011 and since then, the activity is televised yearly.\n\nManok-Manok (Chicken) Festival in Barangay San Pedro every June and Hito (Catfish) Festival in Barangay Camachilihan every August are also observed.\n\nBustos is a recipient of the 2017 Seal of Good Local Governance given by the Department of Interior and Local Government. Based on the 2019 Philippine general election, here are the following elected local officials of the Municipality of Bustos for the term 2019 - 2022.\n\nNorth Luzon Expressway has a by-pass road that passes through the municipality of Bustos that shortens the transportation of goods and passengers from some areas in Bulacan going to Metro Manila and Nueva Ecija. The Bustos by-pass road passes through Gen. Alejo Santos Highway at Barangay Bonga Menor, Bustos, Bulacan and travels to NLEx Balagtas Exit Toll Plaza leading to Balintawak Cloverleaf, Quezon City on the one side and San Rafael, Bulacan leading to Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija on the other side.\n\nThere are eight secondary schools in Bustos, four of which are public while every barangay has its own public pre-elementary and elementary school.\n\nBulacan State University - Bustos Campus (BulSU-Bustos) is the largest satellite campus of the university.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name \"\"Calumpit\"\" comes from the tree \"\"Kalumpít\"\", an indigenous hardwood species similar to \"apalit\" and narra, which grows abundantly in front of the St. John the Baptist Parish Church in the Población-Sucol area.\n\nCalumpit was already an established \"barangay\" under the leadership of Gat Maitim prior to the Fall of the Kingdom of Tondo in June 1571. Other nearby villages were Gatbuka, Meyto, Meysulao, Pandukot, Malolos, Macabebe, Hagonoy, and Apalit. When Calumpit was hispanised and established as a political and geographical entity in 1572, they chose what is today Barangay Población as the site of the church and the administrative center of the aforementioned villages, which were annexed to it.\n\nUpon hearing that the Kingdom of Tondo was conquered by Martín de Goíti and Juan Salcedo, and that Rajah Matanda allied with the Spaniards in May 1571, Bambalito formed a fleet of two thousand natives mostly from Hagonoy and Macabebe. They sailed across Manila Bay to Tondo on June 3, 1571, facing Goíti and Salcedo in the historic Battle of Bangkusay. Bambalito and the natives were defeated and the conquerors proceeded northwards to pacify other villages along the coast of Manila Bay.\n\nIn September 1571, Goíti and Salcedo, along with the invading forces, arrived at Lubao. On November 14, 1571, they reached Calumpit and Malolos and reported it to Miguel López de Legazpi, the first Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines. The two settlements were then constituted as the Encomienda de Calumpit and Encomienda de Malolos, respectively. The Encomienda de Calumpit was entrusted to Sargento Juan Moron, one of the conquerors in the Legazpi Expedition.\n\nIt is uncertain as to exactly when the Augustinians first set foot in Calumpit, but according to the documents, Calumpit was already a parish by May 3, 1572, when Fray Martín de Rada was elected Prior Provincial. Calumpit was simultaneously established with the conventos of Bay, Laguna, Tondo and Lubao, Pampanga, with De Rada as its prior and Fray Diego Vivar as his vicar.\n\nAccounts state that the Augustinian missionaries planted a wooden cross along the bank of the Meyto River to symbolise the baptism of the land, and they built a chapel made of nipa and bamboo. Later, they moved to Meysulao and built another visita, and then in Panducot, where they built another chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Visitation as Fray Gaspar de San Agustín mentioned in his \"Conquistas delas Isla Philipinas\" (Libro Segundo, Chapter 9). Subsequently, the missionary headquarters was moved again to a much higher place where a very huge and prominent tree called \"Kalumpit\" (\"Terminalia macrocarpa decne\") stands as the original settlers named the place. Another notable characteristic of the village of Calumpit is that it was bounded by rivers which served as a natural moat-like feature. Primarily, Meyto, Meysulao, Panducot and Calumpit was independent barangays under their own chiefs, it is same with Gatbuka, Bugyon and other old settlements. On April 5, 1572, Legaspi merged the villages of Meyto, Meysulao, Panducot, Calumpit, Candaba, Apalit and Malolos and these villages became ministerios and visitas and these settlements first formed the town named Calumpit, with present-day Calumpit as center. On December 28, 1575, Gov. General Francisco Sande ordered the inclusion of the villages of Agonoy (Hagonoy), Quinabalonan (now Santa Monica and San Jose, Hagonoy), and some villages along Macabebe river to the town of Calumpit.\n\nWhen Calumpit was already pacified by Spaniards and submitted under the colonial rule, In April 5, 1572, Encomiendas of Calumpit and Malolos was unified under the shared administration of their encomenderos Don Marcos de Herrera and Sargento Mayor Juan Moron. One month later on the same year Calumpit was created as one of the centers of the Augustinian ministry in Northern Luzon with Convento de Lubao Pampanga, which includes Betis and Bacolor and Convento de Taal Batangas established in May 3, 1572, upon the election of Fray Martín de Rada as the new Prior Provincial of the Augustinians replacing Fray Diego de Herrera who was recalled to Mexico. This parochial beginnings of Calumpit has included the old villages of Hagonoy, Apalit, Candaba, Malolos and Macabebe as its missions. The town of Calumpit was originally dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, but in December 1576, the town was re-dedicated to the patronage of Saint John the Baptist.\n\nOn December 28, 1575 Governor-General Francisco de Sande established Calumpit as an Alcaldia (Province) with Marcos de Arce as the first \"Alcalde Mayor\", with Calumpit and nearby visitas and settlements such as Malolos, Hagonoy, Macabebe, Apalit and Candaba. Later in 1576, jurisdiction of Macabebe transferred to the town of Lubao and Candaba separated an became town, then on June 11, 1580, Malolos became a town and it was transffered to Alcaldia de Bulacan. In 1581, Hagonoy had its own convent but still under the Governor of Calumpit, while in 1591 Apalit officially separated and established as an independent town and it was transferred in the reconfigured territory of Pampanga province. In Miguel de Loarca's document in 1581 called \"Relación de las Islas Filipinas\" and the June 1591 document of Governor-General Luis Pérez de Dasmariñas, it is proven that Calumpit appears as an independent Alcaldia, independent of those of Bulacan and Lubao and Betis. It was therefore established as an Encomienda and Alcaldia separate to Province of Bulacan. Contrary to popular belief, Calumpit was not only the first town founded in Bulacan but it existed as a Province.\n\nThe Alcaldia de Calumpit was eventually abolished and the towns of Calumpit and Hagonoy were annexed to the Province of Bulacan. Neighbouring Apalit was meanwhile annexed to Pampanga.\n\nDuring the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Calumpiteños participated in battles launched by the Katipunan against the Spanish Empire. Many notable Calumeteños helped establish and support the Malolos Republic, with the town serving as a defense line due to its proximity to the new capital. When the Philippine–American War erupted, Calumpit become the headquarters of General Antonio Luna in 1898. In the bloody encounters at Barrio Bagbag on April 25, 1899, many people joined the army of General Luna.\n\nCivil administration under the United States-led Insular Government was established in Calumpit in April 1901, with Juan Galang serving as the first elected American-era mayor of the town.\n\nCalumpit played an important role at the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific theater. The bridge of Calumpit, on the way to Bataan was demolished by the Engineering Battalion of the U.S., impeding movement of the Japanese forces on their way to Bataan. In January 1942, the Japanese Government occupied Calumpit for three years, during which many of the townsfolk died.\n\nIn the middle of 1943, the first part of the USAFFE guerrilla was established under the leadership of Luis Macam, with most of the members from Calumpit.\n\nIn June 1944, the 4th Battalion of the Del Pilar Regiment was established under the leadership of Major Francisco del Rosario. They continued fighting until the returned of the USAFFE under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur.\n\nIn January 1945, the combined Filipino and American troops arrived in the town, liberating it from Japanese control.\n\nCalumpit is from Manila and from Malolos City.\n\nCalumpit is sprawled over an area of 5,625 has. of flat terrain classified accordingly to use for agricultural (66.81%), residential (10.42%), industrial (2.48%), commercial, (0.89%) and other (1.05%) purposes. It occupies around 2.06% of the total land area of Bulacan. The municipality has 144.33 kilometers of concrete roads that easily link its 29 barangays.\n\nTwo distinct seasons characterize the town’s climate: rainy season which starts late May and ends around November; and dry season which begins November and lasts until April.\n\nCalumpit has two types of soil – the silt loam which is found in almost 90% of the entire municipality and the clay loam in the south-east far end of the town. Both types are basically suited for agricultural purposes as per Department of Agriculture (Philippines) classifications.\n\nThe stretch of waterway where two great rivers traversing through Calumpit, the Angat River and the Pampanga River is referred to as the \"Calumpit River\".\n\nThis river has shaped the lives of Bulakeños since time immemorial. With the longest river system in Bulacan, Calumpit River traverses the towns of Calumpit, Pulilan and Plaridel on the east, Paombong and Hagonoy in the West and winds up through Apalit, Macabebe and Masantol, Pampanga.\n\nIt was the major route for trade and commerce in this part of the Luzon prior to the arrival of Spain. The Pampanga and Quingua Rivers served as arteries through which goods coming in and going out of Calumpit passed. At present, the river is a valued resource as a rich fishing ground and providing farmers with irrigation.\n\nThe climate of Calumpit is similar to that of the rest of the other municipalities in the province of Bulacan. It is characterized by two (2) distinct seasons namely; the rainy and the dry. The rainy seasons starts from late May and ends around November, the dry season from December to April. The average annual rainfall is with the month of August having the highest month average rainfall, about . The annual number of rainy days is 175 days.\n\nCalumpit is divided into 29 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Calumpit was , with a density of .\n\nCalumpit's population was 101,068 in the Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO) 2010 census. Historically, its population grew at an average of 3.71% per annum.\n\nThe barangay with the largest population is Iba Oeste, with 10,610 residents, while the smallest is Sucol with 1,410 residents.\n\nCalumpit has a relatively young population, with the age group 1–19 years old, constituting 46.01% of the total population. The rest consists mainly of the working group between the ages of 20 to 59 years old accounting for about 47.96% and the elderly comprising 6.02%.\n\nIn terms of sex distribution, males exceeded the number of females very slightly with a count of 35,710 and 35,087, respectively.\n\nCalumpit is a predominantly Tagalog-speaking town, with about 96.3% of its people being fluent speakers. Residents in the northernmost barangays (bordering Apalit) speak Kapampangan while a minority speak other Philippine languages.\n\nAs Calumpit is the first town in Bulacan to have been Christianized by the Spaniards in 1572, about 80% of residents profess the Roman Catholic faith. Under the United States and because of the eventual disestablishment of the Catholic Church in the Philippines in 1902, Protestantism gained a foothold in the municipality. Significant religious minorities include the Iglesia ni Cristo, Members Church of God International, Iglesia Filipina Independiente.\n\nAmong the oldest churches in Bulacan found in Calumpit is the San Juan Bautista Church. Constructed under Augustinian friars Martín de Rada and Diego Vivar, it was initially made of nipa and bamboo and gradually built of stone in 1700. It enshrines the local patron saint, John the Baptist, whose liturgical birthday on 24 June is celebrated as the town fiesta.\n\nInside the church is a tunnel that, as legend would have it, was used by priests during the Spanish era as an escape route in the event of Chinese and Moro pirate attacks. It is a declared Diocesean Shrine of the Diocese of Malolos.\nThe Meyto Shrine marks the cradle of Christianity in western Bulacan, where a wooden cross was first planted and first mass in the region was said in May 1572. The shrine, located in the western part of town, is also the site of the original church of Calumpit, predating the existing one in the town centre. During the Philippine Revolution, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente – which had by then separated rom the Catholic Church – took over Meyto Shrine.\n\nIn 1995, Calumpit had a relatively big labor force of 24,095 or 66% of the population aged 20–59. Around 35% of these skilled and were employed in their respective occupations; 28% were housewives with occasional employment as farmhands, selling farm produce in the market and doing marginal odd jobs. Others were unclassified and consisted mostly of students, out-of-school youth and the unemployed.\n\nTotal household income per annum is ₱705 million, with the annual average household income is ₱66,600 and per capita income annually is ₱12,198.\n\nThe high literacy rate (98.5%) is maintained by its 24 elementary schools and six secondary or high schools. The Bulacan Manpower and Livelihood Training Center (BMLTC), based at the heart of the town, offers vocational courses and serves as the training ground for both unskilled and highly skilled workers. As a result, most Calumpiteños have acquired and maintained skills suited for employment especially in the agri-industrial field.\n\nMajor industries:\n\nMajor products:\n\nIndustrial estates:\n\nCalumpit celebrates its town \"fiesta\" from June 23 to 24. The \"Libad\" is a river procession held every Saint John's Eve on June 23 to honour the town's patron. Calumpiteños sing, dance and douse water to \"baptize\" passers-by, recalling the saint's characteristic act. The ritual and its traditional route are relics of the old fluvial procession held when Apalit and Hagonoy were still governed from Calumpit. The festivities carry on to the next day, June 24, the feast of Saint John the Baptist.\n\nOne of the oldest barangays in the town, established in 1575, Santa Lucia is very popular and famous because of the supposedly miraculous image of its patroness, Saint Lucy. During the village festival, every December 12–13, the streets of the village are strung with colorful \"banderitas\", as is the façade of Santa Lucia Church. Pilgrims visit the church for the two-day celebration, with the novena to the saint beginning on December 4.\n\nBagbag Bridge was the site of the longest battle between the Americans and Filipinos led by General Gregorio del Pilar on April 25, 1899. The bridge is now a reminder of the valor displayed by the Filipino who triumphed against the American forces.\n\n\nCalumpit has several elementary and secondary schools. It also has some private colleges including Colegio de Calumpit, established in 1940. Calumpit does not host any university and residents study in Malolos where Bulacan State University and other universities are located.\n\n\n"}

From a predominating agricultural economy, it gradually urbanized and developed, now part of the Metro Manila conurbation. Guiguinto is from Manila and from Malolos City.\n\nIt is the birthplace of composer Constancio De Guzman, known for writing songs like \"\"Maalaala Mo Kaya\"\". It also houses the Immaculate Conception Seminary, a Diocesan Seminary of the Diocese of Malolos located in barangay Tabe. The appellation “Guiguinto” literally translates to “Gold” for the early conquistadores came and saw this town on a harvest season when it lushes in golden rice stalks against the sun.\n\nGuiguinto began as a barrio of Bulakan, the former provincial capital of Bulacan. It is said that Spaniards set up an army post in the barrio to serve as a resting place for forces going to Northern Luzon. In those days, travel throughout Guiguinto was difficult and slow down to cross single file over a narrow bamboo bridge. Their Filipino guides would cry out, \"\"Hinto\"\" (stop). The Spaniards thought this was the name \"Hihinto\". The Spaniards substituted \"Gui\" (with hard \"g\") for the Tagalog \"Hi\". The place has since been called Guiguinto. On the other hand, old timers say that on moonlight nights, a golden bull emerges from the church and goes down to the nearby river to quench his thirst. It then returns to the church, ascends at the altar and disappears. The elders' aid that there are buried jars of gold in town, as indicated by the bull, and that is why the town was called Guiguinto. It became an encomienda in the 1591 but the ecclesiastical administration was under Bulakan Convent and it was established as a Town in 1641.\n\nIn 1800, an Augustinian friar erected a small chapel in what is now barrio Santa Rita. In 1873, roads were constructed in barrio Malis. The people barrios of Pritil, Tabe, and Cutcut even those days were mostly farmers. During Holy Week, villagers of barrio Tuktukan held contest for the hardest egg shells (chicken, duck or goose by knocking eggs together (Tuktukan)). The women tried to help each other in singing the \"Panica\".\n\nJust before the outbreak of the revolution of 1896, the town people of Guiguinto were ordered to sleep in the town at night and to work in their fields only in the day. This was said to have been suggested by the town priest to the authorities because of rumors that many of the town people were joining the secret revolutionary society, the Katipunan. Guiguinto eventually contributed many soldiers to the 1896 revolution.\n\nAt the time of American occupation, the new colonizers reorganized the Province of Bulacan into 19 municipalities from the original 26. Under populated town were subordinated with the large one and the town of Guiguinto was integrated in the town of Bulakan for almost 11 years. In 1915, Guiguinto regain its township again with Antonio Figueroa as its municipal mayor of the modern period. The town's population was then about 4,000. The 1960 census placed Guiguinto's population at 10,629.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nHagonoy was first mentioned in the history of the Philippines in 1571. Even before the \"blood compact\" between the Spain's conqueror Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and the Philippines' Datu Sikatuna was made, the place was already known as Hagonoy. The land consists of archipelagic marsh and river tributaries going to the sea, where the first ancestors of this town probably took this way to reach Hagonoy.\n\nHagonoy first appeared in Philippine history when they formed part of the fleet of Rajah Soliman of Macabebe, Pampanga that met Martin de Goiti at the Battle of Bangkusay in the initial defense of the Lusong Empire against the Spaniards in 1571.\n\nIn the beginning, Hagonoy was part of Alcaldia de Calumpit as its visita together with Apalit. It has huge convent having founded in April 22, 1581 with Fray Diego Ordonez de Vivar as its first minister according to Gaspar's \"Conquistas delas Islas\" Book 2 (Fray Diego having credited for the christiniazation of Calumpit, Malolos and Bulakan). At first, it was also included in the territorial part of Encomienda de Calumpit that was given by Governor General Gonzalo Ronquillo to Sargento Juan de Moron for his good service and loyalty to Spanish Crown. Sargento Juan Moron once trusted his land to the Augustinian friars, and that's how it was handed to Fray Diego Vivar. It is also noted that on the primary sources documents such as Miguel de Loarca's \"Relacion delas Islas\" written in 1582 and Luis Perez de Dasmarinas report on King of Spain in June 1591 didn't mention Hagonoy as an independent encomienda or town, instead it is simultaneously with the much older town of Calumpit and it was officially established as a civil town in May 1671. According to records and old folks, there were already inhabitants in some places of this settlement.These places were Tibaguin and Pugad, coastal barrios sharing the coastline with the City of Malolos and towns of Bulakan, Obando and the City of Manila.\n\nMagat Salamat, a revolutionary hero, and the last Prince of the Kingdom of Tondo, once headed this town. He was the ancestor of the Salamat families now living in different barrios of this town.\n\nThe town was named after the \"hagunoy\" \"(Chromolaena odorata)\", a medicinal plant that used to be abundant in its river banks and along the seashores. The original populace used its leaves as their herbal remedy of choice for common illnesses and as food ingredients. Because of the medicinal value of the plant, the news of its effectiveness spread leading the people to call the place \"Hagonoy\".\n\nIn the 15th century, some friars took a boat from Manila to the province of Bulacan and reached what was then called \"Quinabaloan\" (meaning \"pinag-alaman\" - which was then still part of the town of Calumpit). This is now the Barangays of Santa Monica & San Jose). At that time, a very charming lass was so popular among the young men of the locality. She had many suitors and admirers. One day, she felt ill. She needed someone to get leaves of the hagonoy plant by the river (which is now called Sapang Pari---because the friars and priests used this river to commute).\n\nA man offered to promptly get some leaves of the plant and in deep gratitude, she promised to marry him. As he was gathering the leaves of the hagonoy plant for his dearly beloved, the group of friars in a passing boat stopped to ask him, \"Quien vive?\" (Where are we?). The man did not understand Spanish and was extremely intimidated by the \"guardia civil\" (Spanish civil guard) that escorted the friars. Thinking that they were asking what he was grasping in his hands, he quickly retorted \"Hagonoy po!\" (Hagonoy, sir!) and scampered away.\n\nThese were the first Augustinian friars that got into town and they noted the place's name as \"Hagonoy\". Hence, the origin of the illustrious town's name.\n\nWith a total land area of 103.10 square kilometers, Hagonoy is situated at the south-west corner of the province of Bulacan. It is bounded by the municipality of Calumpit on the north, municipality of Paombong on the east, municipality of Masantol, Pampanga on the west and Manila Bay on the south. The municipality is approximately 54 kilometers from Metro Manila or about an hour and a half drive. It can be accessed via North Luzon Expressway and MacArthur Highway.\n\nHagonoy is a long ridge with a lake on its edge by the Manila Bay called \"Wawa\", which is now part of Barangays San Sebastian and San Nicolas. It is basically a fishing town with the Manila Bay as its proximate fishing ground, which extends up to the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan, and Cavite. Its more adventurous fisherfolk brave the waves of the South China Sea northward and cross into the Philippine Sea in the Pacific Ocean on the eastern seaboard where they cast their nets and haul their catch to the fishing ports of Quezon province.\n\nHagonoy is politically subdivided into 26 barangays grouped into 5 clusters or \"kumpol\" for statistical purposes.

The town offers a variety of harvest which includes prawns, shrimps, milkfish, tilapia, crabs, mussels and oysters.\n\nWith its abundant water resources and the coastal nature of the town, majority of the population is dependent on fishing industry.

It is subdivided to 7 lots with a combined lot area of 412 hectares of municipal waters.\n\nTwo local fish ports called \"pundohan\" – one in barrio San Nicolas and the other at the Poblacion, are the busiest commercial areas in the town. Fish traders from Lucena City, Quezon and Dagupan City, Pangasinan among other merchants of other provinces are regular bulk buyers the local ports or at the private \"consignacions\" (brokerage) of the large milkfish growers.\n\nThe coastal barrios are virtually 24/7 as fishermen go out to the sea at night for hours or even days while their loving families and relatives await them. Upon their return, their catch is immediately sorted out and sold at the local public markets and \"talipapa\" of the barangays. Their catch are also transported to the public markets in nearby towns and up to the public/private markets and supermarkets in Metro Manila.\n\nBarangay Santo Niño adjacent to the Poblacion is host to the numerous brokers of prawns for the domestic and export markets. The boats that sell their prawn catch at these brokers at times come from as far as the province of Capiz. A processing plant very near the brokers prepares and packages the prawns to export quality and global standards.\n\nThere are 2 “talipapa” (flea markets) in Hagonoy that also played minor central business districts – Santo Rosario and San Agustin.

He was billed as the brother of Fritz Von Erich, making him a fictitious member of the Von Erich family.\n\nSieber was born in Toronto, Ontario. His parents divorced when he was seven. As a youth, he participated in weightlifting at the YMCA in Weston along other future professional wrestlers including Dave McKigney, Geeto Mongol, and Mikel Scicluna. At the age of 16, he began training as a professional wrestling under Red Garner in a garage in Richmond Hill.\n\nSieber debuted at the age of 17 under the ring name \"Waldo Von Sieber\". He began his career in Calgary, wrestling for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion using the character of an evil German. In the late-1950s, Hart paired Sieber with Fritz Von Erich, who also portrayed a villainous German. With Sieber changing his ring name to \"Waldo Von Erich\", the duo billed themselves as brothers and formed a tag team.\n\nIn 1964, Von Erich headlined Madison Square Garden in three bouts against Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship.

Political boundaries of Angat and \"Pueblo de Casay y Matictic\" were demarcated and the newly created town was renamed as \"Norzagaray\" in honor of the said Governor-General Fernando de Norzagaray.\n\nAs early as 2005, the town’s Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 2005 requesting the Senate of the Philippines through its president, Franklin Drilon and the House of Representatives thru its speaker, Jose de Venecia Jr. to co-sponsor a bill for Norzagaray’s conversion into a city and creation of a lone legislative district.\n\nThe town of Norzagaray is bordered by City of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan and Rodriguez, Rizal, to the south; by General Nakar, Quezon to the east; Santa Maria to the west; Angat, Bulacan is north-west; and Doña Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan is to the north.\n\nNorzagaray is politically subdivided into 13 barangays. Friendship Village Resources (FVR) was created into a barangay under \"Sangguniang Panlalawigan Kapasiyahan Bilang 179-T 2002\" and \"Sangguniang Panlalawigan Kautusan Bilang 003\" on April 18, 2002; ratified on October 12, 2002; taken from barangay Tigbe.\n\nIn the , the population of Norzagaray was people, with a density of .\n\nJust as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.\n\nThe executive branch is composed of the governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III, Department of Interior and Local Government official website. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial assembly) for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.\n\nThe seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislGermar\n\n\nIn 2017, Norzagaray generated a total revenue of P457.59 million, P73.23 million or 19% higher than its previous income in 2016, making it as the 4th richest municipality in Bulacan after Marilao, Santa Maria and Baliuag. \n\nCement, Marble/Marble Processing, Food/Food Processing, Pyrotechnics \n\nBakeries, Processed meat and Agricultural products \n\nCement and Marbles\n\nToday, the town of Norzagaray is quickly rising in terms of commercial and economic status with tourist potentials. \"Bakas\" which is on a portion of the Angat River is recognized as one of the busiest places in the locality, particularly during summertime. People from distant towns often visit the place for relaxation.\n\nAnother potential spot for tourism is the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve where the Angat River Hydroelectric Plant or Angat Dam is located. The dam is the biggest hydroelectric plant the National Power Corporation (NPC) has ever constructed in terms of power capacity within the entire Philippines. Because of Angat Dam's size, its reservoir sinks to critical levels during the dry season necessitating the need for cloud seeding in some years. The reservoir of this hydroelectric plant is covered with forests producing a cool climate.\n\nAnother is the Pinagrealan Cave located in Barangay Bigte. This cave is a subterranean network of caverns extending more than a kilometer deep. The Katipunero Revolutionaries during the war against Spain used it as a camp in 1896 and again during the Filipino-American War in 1898 as hideout of General Emilio Aguinaldo (the First President of the Philippines). It was also used as a sanctuary by the Japanese Imperial Army when the Philippines was liberated by joint Filipino and American Forces.\n\nThere are still other sites with tourism potential in the locality. However, some of these places are located in remote areas of the town, which are inaccessible to motor vehicles, therefore in need of immediate attention.\n\nThe natives are religious and hear Mass or pray in the Catholic and INC churches. The town also remembers the 31 heroes of the Revolution.\n\n\nThe town's prime eternal repose garden is located in Minuyan.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, Bulacan and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) signed an agreement for the development of a P11-billion bulk water supply project. Ayala-owned Manila Water Co. Inc. will implement the project. MWSS and Manila Water will provide a financial package of an infrastructure grant, a P10-million development assistance and a P10-million royalty fee to the towns of Norzagaray and Doña Remedios Trinidad, which will host the water supply project.\n\nOn January 19, 2008, an 18-hectare waste disposal facility, a new sanitary landfill that would also be a tourist attraction opened in Norzagaray, Bulacan province. The president of Wacuman Corp. stated: \"I want them to see our system in our place which should not be abhorred because we are using the new state-of-the-art technology.\" The facility has a category 4 rating (the highest category for a sanitary landfill) from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources\n\n"}

She is a member of the Lehman family.\n\nBarney was born Tina Isles, one of three children of Philip Henry Isles (1912–1989) and his wife 1940s fashion model Lillian Fox. Her parents later divorced and her mother remarried to writer Stephane Groueff. Her great-grandfather was Emanuel Lehman, co-founder of Lehman Brothers. She was introduced to photography by her grandfather when she was a child. As a teenager, she studied Art History at Spence School in Manhattan, and at the age of 19, she lived in Italy for a time where she was able to further study art. Barney first got involved with photography, when she was asked to volunteer for the Junior Council of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, around 1971, working in the photography department and cataloguing work for a show. She started to collect photographs and go to different galleries, to educate herself on the medium. After moving to Sun Valley, Idaho in 1973, she started to take photography classes as a hobby. While in Idaho, she studied at the Sun Valley Center for Arts and Humanities in Ketchum, from 1976 to 1979. Additionally, she has completed workshops with Frederick Sommer, Roger Mertin, Joyce Niemanas, Duane Michals, Nathan Lyons, John Pfahl, and Robert Cumming.\n\nBarney is most well known for creating large format, colorful photographs of her wealthy, East Coast family. The images straddle the line between candid and tableau photography. Although, the wealthy became a sort of aesthetic in Barney's work, her \"fascination is with the repetition of traditions and rituals. The idea that families no matter where they come from, kind of do the same thing.\" Barney's work is in the collections of the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester, New York; the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas; the JPMorgan Chase Art Collection in New York City; and the Museum of Contemporary Photography.

His maternal grandparents were Sam and Gertrude Eisenberg. \nHis father, Dr. Arthur \"Artie\" Niederhoffer (1917–1981), graduated from Brooklyn College in 1937, and then from Brooklyn Law School, and finally with a Ph.D. from New York University (1963). He served in the New York City Police Department for 21 years (retiring as a lieutenant), and then taught as a professor of Sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice for 14 years. Also he taught at Hofstra University, Brooklyn College, New York University, Queens College, and the New York City Police Academy, authored several books on the police and criminology including \"Behind the Shield\", \"The Ambivalent Force\", \"The Gang\", and \"The Police Family: From Station House to Ranch House\" (co-authored with his wife), and was awarded the President's Medal of John Jay College for his achievements in criminal justice. His mother, Elaine (née Eisenberg) Niederhoffer (1925–2006), was an English teacher, author, and editor who had descended from a long line of rabbis. His brother Roy Niederhoffer, who is himself a hedge fund manager, worked for Victor and his hedge fund from 1987 to 1992, trading fixed-income securities.\n\nNiederhoffer studied statistics and economics at Harvard University (B.A. 1964) and the University of Chicago (Ph.D. 1969). He was a finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1967–1972). In 1965, while still at college, he co-founded with Frank Cross a company called Niederhoffer, Cross and Zeckhauser, Inc., an investment bank which sold privately held firms to public companies. This firm is now called Niederhoffer Henkel, and was run by Lee Henkel (who died May 30, 2008), the former general counsel to the IRS. Niederhoffer pioneered a mass marketing approach in investment banking and did a large volume of small deals at this firm. He also bought many privately held firms with Dan Grossman, his partner during this period.\n\nAs a college professor in the 1960s and 1970s, Niederhoffer wrote academic articles about market inefficiencies, which led to the founding in 1980 of a trading firm, NCZ Commodities, Inc. (aka Niederhoffer Investments, Inc.). The success of this firm attracted the attention of George Soros. Niederhoffer became a partner of Soros and managed all of the fixed income and foreign exchange from 1982 to 1990. Soros said in \"The Alchemy of Finance\" that Niederhoffer was the only one of his managers who retired voluntarily from trading for him while still ahead. Soros held Niederhoffer in such high esteem that he sent his son to work for him to learn how to trade.\n\nAs an academic at Berkeley in the 1960s, Niederhoffer wrote a number of papers on anomalies in stock market behavior. His paper \"Market Making and Reversal on the Stock Exchange (1966)\" made Niederhoffer the father of statistical arbitrage and of market microstructure studies. He used innovative methods to search for opportunities in stock markets, such as his paper \"The Analysis of World Events and Stock Prices (1971)\", which used the font size of news print to determine the relative importance of news events and measure how they affected the stock market. He left academia in 1972 to concentrate fully on his business activities.\n\nNiederhoffer Investments returned 35% a year from inception through 1996, when MAR ranked it the No. 1 hedge fund manager in the world. In 1997, Niederhoffer published a New York Times bestselling book, \"The Education of a Speculator\".\n\nIn 1997, Niederhoffer Investments was not finding many opportunities for investments and, having returned much of its funds to customers such as George Soros, began investing the remaining 100 million dollars in areas where Niederhoffer later admitted that he did not have much expertise. Niederhoffer decided to buy Thai bank stocks, which had fallen heavily in the Asian financial crisis, his bet being that the Thai government would not allow these companies to go out of business. On October 27, 1997, losses resulting from this investment, combined with a 554-point (7.2%) single-day decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the eighth largest point decline to date in index history), forced Niederhoffer Investments to close its doors. In a lawsuit that Niederhoffer later filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where he traded options, he alleged that floor traders colluded to drive the market down that day to force him out of his positions. Traders at the time said Refco may have been responsible for as much as $35 million of Niederhoffer's losses.\n\nSince closing down his fund in 1997, he began trading for his own account again in 1998, after mortgaging his house and selling his antique silver collection. This original fund is called Wimbledon Fund, the name reflecting his love of tennis. He began managing money for offshore clients in February 2002, with the Matador Fund. Niederhoffer employs proprietary computer programs that purports to predict short-term moves using multivariate time series analysis. In a five-year period beginning in 2001, Niederhoffer's fund returned 50% a year (compounded). His worst year in this period was 2004, returning 40%. In 2005, he returned 56.2% (as reported in eFinancial News). On April 6, 2006, the industry group MarHedge awarded Matador Fund Ltd. and Manchester Trading, two funds managed by Niederhoffer, the prize for best performance by a commodity trading advisor (CTA) in the two years 2004 and 2005.\n\nHowever, Niederhoffer's funds were caught up in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, and the Matador Fund was closed in September 2007 after a decline in value of more than seventy-five percent.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Niederhoffer co-wrote with financial writer Laurel Kenner a weekly column on the markets for CNBC MoneyCentral. He and Kenner co-wrote \"Practical Speculation\" (John Wiley & Sons, February 2003), c.e. Niederhoffer's life story, and the lessons he learned, were told in the 1997 book \"The Education of a Speculator\".\n\nNiederhoffer was a winning hardball squash player and is a member of the squash hall of fame. Niederhoffer had never played squash when he entered Harvard University in 1960, but he had played other racquet sports. One year later, he won the national junior title, and, by the time he graduated, he was the National Intercollegiate squash champion. He won the U.S. Nationals five times (a record exceeded only by Stanley Pearson, who won his sixth in 1923). He also won three national doubles titles. In 1975, he defeated one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Sharif Khan, in the final of the North American Open (the only time that Khan failed to win the title in the 13-year period between 1969 and 1981).\n\nNiederhoffer is also the founder of the NYC Junto, a libertarian group hosted on the first Thursday of every month from 1985 to 2017. He is an enthusiast of Ayn Rand, and named two of his daughters Galt and Rand. The NYC Junto focuses on libertarianism, objectivism and investing and was inspired by the Junto hosted by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia from 1727 to 1757. He has six daughters and one son.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1980, he founded his hedge fund, Tudor Investment Corporation, an asset management firm headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Eight years later he founded the Robin Hood Foundation, which focuses on poverty reduction.\n\nJones was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Paul Tudor Jones II's father John Paul \"Jack\" Jones practiced transportation law from an office located next door to \"The Daily News\", a publication his family has owned and operated since 1886 and where Jack Jones was the publisher for 34 years.\n\nJones graduated from Presbyterian Day School, an all-boys elementary school, before attending Memphis University School for high school. Jones then went on to the University of Virginia where he was a welterweight boxing champion. While at the University of Virginia, Jones was president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. To pay for tuition, Jones wrote for his family's paper under the pseudonym \"Paul Eagle.\" \n\nIn 1976, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Virginia. In the 1980s, Jones was accepted to Harvard Business School but did not attend.\n\nIn 1976 after graduating from the University of Virginia Jones asked his cousin William Dunavant Jr. for an introduction to trading. Dunavant was the CEO of \"Dunavant Enterprises\", one of the world's largest cotton merchants. Dunavant sent Jones to talk with commodity broker Eli Tullis in New Orleans. Tullis represented some of the largest cotton traders in the world. Tullis hired Jones and mentored him in trading cotton futures at the New York Cotton Exchange. Eli Tullis fired Jones when he fell asleep at his desk after a night of partying in New Orleans. Many years later Jones served as treasurer in 1986 and then as chairman of the New York Cotton Exchange from August 1992 through June 1995.\n\nAt 24 years old Jones became a commodities broker for E. F. Hutton & Co. While working at E.F. Hutton Jones met, worked with and became friends with Glenn Dubin.\n\nJones' firm manages $7.8 billion (as of June 30, 2019). Their investment capabilities are broad and diverse, including global macro trading, fundamental equity investing in the U.S. and Europe, emerging markets, venture capital, commodities, event-driven strategies, and technical trading systems.\n\nThe Tudor Group, consisting of Tudor Investment Corporation and its affiliates, is involved in active trading, investing, and research in assets across fixed income, currencies, equities, and commodities asset classes and related derivative and other instruments in the global markets for an international clientele. The investment strategies of the Tudor Group include, among others, discretionary global macro, quantitative global macro (managed futures), discretionary equity long/short, quantitative equity market neutral and growth equity.\n\nTudor (i.e. Jones) used his experience in trading cotton to branch into to other commodities and financial instruments such as stock-index contracts and currency futures.\n\nIn 1987 betting on a crash in the United States stock market Jones' Tudor' returned 125.9 percent after fees, earning an estimated $100 million.\n\nPeter Borish, second-in-command to Jones at Tudor Investment Corporation, anticipated the crash in 1987 by mapping the 1987 market against the market preceding the 1929 crash.\n\nIn October 2012, it was announced that Glenn Dubin, Paul Tudor Jones and Timothy Barakett were among a group of investors buying the merchant energy operation Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy (\"LDH Energy\") from Louis Dreyfus Company and Highbridge Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund. The new company was named Castleton Commodities International, LLC.\n\nAs reported in \"Market Wizards\" and the press, Jones futures trading style and beliefs are as follows:\nJones's global macro trading style is based primarily on technical analysis, as opposed to value investing, with an emphasis momentum factors driving markets. In a 2000 interview, he suggested however he regretted not being more involved with venture investing in technology firms during the 1990s.\n\nAs of November 2019, \"Forbes Magazine\" estimated his net worth to be US$5.3 billion, making him the 343rd richest person on the Forbes 400 and the 7th highest-earning hedge fund manager.\n\n destroying wetlands - In 1990, Jones pleaded guilty to illegally destroying 86 acres of protected wetlands on his Maryland Eastern Shore hunting estate with 1,400 cubic yards of gravel, without a permit. Jones was ordered to pay $1 million fine and $1 million in restitution to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and by pleading guilty avoided a possible one-year jail term for violating the Federal Clean Water Act.\n\n 1986 adopts sixth grade class - In 1986, after watching an episode of CBS News' 60 Minutes Jones adopted a sixth grade class in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn at an underperforming public school by guaranteeing college scholarships to students that graduated from high school. His idea was this would be an incentive to students to engage in academics with his goal being that 90% of those students successfully complete high school. However, only 33% of the students in the class eventually graduated from high school. Jones believed he \"vastly underestimated both the academic and social challenges facing [the students in the class he adopted]\" and his program was \"completely ill-equipped to [help them] in an efficient fashion.\" In his 2009 speech, Jones explained that this major failure on his part taught him lessons he's applied in subsequent education efforts.\n\nIn 2009, Jones delivered a commencement speech at the Buckley School about his experiences with failure and comebacks. He talked about failing to get 86 underserved students into college despite expense and effort later helped him start one of the most successful charter schools in New York.\n\nHe founded and chaired the Bedford Stuyvesant I Have A Dream Foundation, which puts local students in colleges.\n\nJones has made large donations to his alma mater, the University of Virginia, including a $44 million donation, which went to the construction of a new basketball arena, named the John Paul Jones Arena, in honor of his father, an attorney who also attended the University of Virginia. In April 2012, UVA announced the creation of a new Contemplative Sciences Center through a $12 million gift from Jones and his wife, Sonia.\n\nJones is the founder of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization that attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City. Backed mainly by hedge fund operators. Other founding members include Peter Borish and Glenn Dubin.\n\nHe set up the nonprofit Just Capital to help Americans learn about companies that are considered \"just\". The organization uses data to discover which companies are most involved with the priorities Americans find most important. The nonprofit uses an annual, multi-phase survey to find out what these priorities are. Just Capital also operates a for profit ETF (exchange traded fund) comprising only companies believed to be \"just\".\n\n 2012 Ousting of University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan - In June 2012, he was reportedly a key figure in the controversial ousting of University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan. He penned an editorial supporting her resignation. On June 26, 2012, The University of Virginia Board of Visitors unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan.\n\n2017: Harvey Weinstein friendship - Jones was a friend of alleged sex offender Harvey Weinstein and a member of the board of The Weinstein Company. In 2017, as Weinstein came under increasing pressure, Jones wrote him an email saying, \"I love you\", provided encouragement that the scrutiny would soon end, and advised him on how he could revive his reputation. Jones distanced himself from Weinstein in a written statement, \"Harvey was a friend I believed too long and defended too long.\"\n\n 1987 PBS Trader documentary - In 1987, PBS produced a documentary entitled 'Trader' which focused on Jones's activities. The film shows Jones as a young man predicting the 1987 crash, using methods similar to those of market forecaster Robert Prechter. Although the video was shown on public television in November 1987, few copies exist. When copies surface, Jones attempts to buy them up. According to Michael Glyn, the video's director, Jones requested in the 1990s that the documentary be removed from circulation. The video has surfaced from time to time on different video sharing and torrent sites, but has often been taken down shortly thereafter due to copyright claims. Various theories exist as to why Jones does not support the film. Despite the film's showing a positive approach to risk and client care, as well as showcasing Jones's charity work, it has been suggested that the film may reveal trading secrets.\n\nLow profile within financial media circles beginning in the late 1980s through to a report in 1997 Jones kept interviews with financial reporters to a minimum; while keeping a low profile in financial circles he was visible appearing on Larry King Live, promoting his \"Save Our Everglades\" campaign and the Robin Hood Foundation.\n\nIn 2019 Reuters has described Jones as ‘one of the giants’ and reported that Jones is considered a legend among macro traders.\n\nBy the mid-1980s Jones as reported by Institutional Investor magazine was \"developing a reputation for courting models and partying long into the night\" and the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page article referring to Jones as Quotron Man in a profile covering his lifestyle. This was transpiring in 1987 as there was a general backlash against excesses on Wall Street. In 1988, Jones married Australian-born Sonia Klein, a New York–based yoga entrepreneur at a wedding in Memphis. In the early 1990s Jones moved Greenwich. They have four children — Caroline, Dorothy \"Dottie\", Chrissy, and Jack. Jones has encouraged his three daughters to go into macro trading.\n\n Political - A political independent, Jones has donated money to numerous Democratic and Republican candidates. In 2012 he donated $200,000 to Mitt Romney. During the 2008 presidential election, Jones hosted a 500-person fundraiser at his Greenwich home for then-candidate Barack Obama. Jones also donated to John McCain and Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaigns.\n\n"}
{"id": "2142269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142269", "title": "Precision Time Protocol", "text": "Precision Time Protocol\n\nThe Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network. On a local area network, it achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable for measurement and control systems. PTP is currently employed to synchronize financial transactions, mobile phone tower transmissions, sub-sea acoustic arrays, and networks that require precise timing but lack access to satellite navigation signals.\n\nThe original version of PTP, IEEE 1588-2002, was published in 2002. IEEE 1588-2008, also known as PTP Version 2 is not backward compatible with the original 2002 version. IEEE 1588-2019 was published in November 2019 and includes backward-compatible improvements to the 2008 publication. IEEE 1588-2008 includes a \"profile\" concept defining PTP operating parameters and options. Several profiles have been defined for applications including telecommunications, electric power distribution and audiovisual. is an adaptation of PTP for use with Audio Video Bridging.\n\nAccording to John Eidson, who led the IEEE 1588-2002 standardization effort, \"IEEE 1588 is designed to fill a niche not well served by either of the two dominant protocols, NTP and GPS. IEEE 1588 is designed for local systems requiring accuracies beyond those attainable using NTP. It is also designed for applications that cannot bear the cost of a GPS receiver at each node, or for which GPS signals are inaccessible.\"\n\nPTP was originally defined in the IEEE 1588-2002 standard, officially entitled \"\"Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems\"\" and published in 2002. In 2008, IEEE 1588-2008 was released as a revised standard; also known as PTP version 2 (PTPv2), it improves accuracy, precision and robustness but is not backward compatible with the original 2002 version. IEEE 1588-2019 was published in November 2019, is informally known as \"PTPv2.1\" and includes backwards-compatible improvements to the 2008 publication.\n\nThe IEEE 1588 standards describe a hierarchical master-slave architecture for clock distribution. Under this architecture, a time distribution system consists of one or more communication media (network segments), and one or more clocks. An \"ordinary clock\" is a device with a single network connection and is either the source of (master) or destination for (slave) a synchronization reference. A \"boundary clock\" has multiple network connections and can accurately synchronize one network segment to another. A synchronization \"master\" is selected for each of the network segments in the system. The root timing reference is called the \"grandmaster\". The grandmaster transmits synchronization information to the clocks residing on its network segment. The boundary clocks with a presence on that segment then relay accurate time to the other segments to which they are also connected.\n\nA simplified PTP system frequently consists of ordinary clocks connected to a single network, and no boundary clocks are used. A grandmaster is elected and all other clocks synchronize directly to it.\n\nIEEE 1588-2008 introduces a clock associated with network equipment used to convey PTP messages. The \"transparent clock\" modifies PTP messages as they pass through the device. Timestamps in the messages are corrected for time spent traversing the network equipment. This scheme improves distribution accuracy by compensating for delivery variability across the network.\n\nPTP typically uses the same epoch as Unix time (start of 1 January 1970). While the Unix time is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and is subject to leap seconds, PTP is based on International Atomic Time (TAI). The PTP grandmaster communicates the current offset between UTC and TAI, so that UTC can be computed from the received PTP time.\n\nSynchronization and management of a PTP system is achieved through the exchange of messages across the communications medium. To this end, PTP uses the following message types.\n\nMessages are categorized as \"event\" and \"general\" messages. \"Event\" messages are time-critical in that accuracy in transmission and receipt timestamp accuracy directly affects clock distribution accuracy. \"Sync\", \"Delay_Req\", \"Pdelay_Req\" and \"Pdelay_resp\" are \"event\" messages. \"General\" messages are more conventional protocol data units in that the data in these messages is of importance to PTP, but their transmission and receipt timestamps are not. \"Announce\", \"Follow_Up\", \"Delay_Resp\", \"Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up\", \"Management\" and \"Signaling\" messages are members of the \"general\" message class.\n\nPTP messages may use the User Datagram Protocol over Internet Protocol (UDP/IP) for transport. IEEE 1588-2002 uses only IPv4 transports, but this has been extended to include IPv6 in IEEE 1588-2008. In IEEE 1588-2002, all PTP messages are sent using multicast messaging, while IEEE 1588-2008 introduced an option for devices to negotiate unicast transmission on a port-by-port basis. Multicast transmissions use IP multicast addressing, for which multicast group addresses are defined for IPv4 and IPv6 (see table). Time-critical \"event\" messages (Sync, Delay_req, Pdelay_Req and Pdelay_Resp) are sent to port number 319. \"General\" messages (Announce, Follow_Up, Delay_Resp, Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up, management and signaling) use port number 320.\n\nIn IEEE 1588-2008, encapsulation is also defined for DeviceNet, ControlNet and PROFINET.\n\nA domain is an interacting set of clocks that synchronize to one another using PTP. Clocks are assigned to a domain by virtue of the contents of the \"Subdomain name\" (IEEE 1588-2002) or the \"domainNumber\" (IEEE 1588-2008) fields in PTP messages they receive or generate. Domains allow multiple clock distribution systems to share the same communications medium.\n\nThe \"best master clock\" (BMC) algorithm performs a distributed selection of the best candidate clock based on the following clock properties:\n\nIEEE 1588-2008 uses a hierarchical selection algorithm based on the following properties, in the indicated order:\n\nIEEE 1588-2002 uses a selection algorithm based on similar properties.\n\nClock properties are advertised in IEEE 1588-2002 \"Sync\" messages and in IEEE 1588-2008 \"Announce\" messages. The current clock master transmits this information at regular interval. A clock which considers itself a better master clock will transmit this information in order to invoke a change of master clock. Once the current master recognises the better clock, the current master stops transmitting \"Sync\" messages and associated clock properties (\"Announce\" messages in the case of IEEE 1588-2008) and the better clock takes over as master. The BMC algorithm only considers the self-declared quality of clocks and does not take network link quality into consideration.\n\nThrough use of the BMC algorithm, PTP selects a master source of time for an IEEE 1588 domain and for each network segment in the domain.\n\nClocks determine the offset between themselves and their master. Let the variable formula_1 represent physical time. For a given slave device, the offset formula_2 at time formula_1 is defined by:\n\nwhere formula_5 represents the time measured by the slave clock at physical time formula_1, and formula_7 represents the time measured by the master clock at physical time formula_1.\n\nThe master periodically broadcasts the current time as a message to the other clocks. Under IEEE 1588-2002 broadcasts are up to once per second. Under IEEE 1588-2008, up to 10 per second are permitted.\n\nEach broadcast begins at time formula_9 with a \"Sync\" message sent by the master to all the clocks in the domain. A clock receiving this message takes note of the local time formula_10 when this message is received.\n\nThe master may subsequently send a multicast \"Follow_Up\" with accurate formula_9 timestamp. Not all masters have the ability to present an accurate timestamp in the \"Sync\" message. It is only after the transmission is complete that they are able to retrieve an accurate timestamp for the \"Sync\" transmission from their network hardware. Masters with this limitation use the \"Follow_Up\" message to convey formula_9. Masters with PTP capabilities built into their network hardware are able to present an accurate timestamp in the \"Sync\" message and do not need to send Follow_Up messages.\n\nIn order to accurately synchronize to their master, clocks must individually determine the network transit time of the \"Sync\" messages. The transit time is determined indirectly by measuring round-trip time from each clock to its master. The clocks initiate an exchange with their master designed to measure the transit time formula_13. The exchange begins with a clock sending a \"Delay_Req\" message at time formula_14 to the master. The master receives and timestamps the \"Delay_Req\" at time formula_15 and responds with a \"Delay_Resp\" message. The master includes the timestamp formula_15 in the \"Delay_Resp\" message.\n\nThrough these exchanges a clock learns formula_9, formula_10, formula_14 and formula_15.\n\nIf formula_13 is the transit time for the \"Sync\" message, and formula_22 is the constant offset between master and slave clocks, then\n\nCombining the above two equations, we find that\n\nThe clock now knows the offset formula_22 during this transaction and can correct itself by this amount to bring it into agreement with their master.\n\nOne assumption is that this exchange of messages happens over a period of time so small that this offset can safely be considered constant over that period. Another assumption is that the transit time of a message going from the master to a slave is equal to the transit time of a message going from the slave to the master. Finally, it is assumed that both the master and slave can accurately measure the time they send or receive a message. The degree to which these assumptions hold true determines the accuracy of the clock at the slave device.\n\nIEEE 1588-2008 standard lists the following set of features that implementations may choose to support:\n\n\n\n"}

The name derives from Duffel, a town in the province of Antwerp in Belgium where the fabric originated. Duffel bags were originally made from the same material. The hood and toggle fastenings proved popular, and the coat spread across Europe by the 1850s. By 1890 it was being supplied to the British Royal Navy. After World War II, the coats became available as government surplus stock and became popular, especially with students.\n\nThere are many variations of duffel coat. The basic British style features:\n\nThe toggle-fastenings are made to be easily fastened and unfastened while wearing gloves in cold weather. Current designs often feature imitation plastic buffalo horn. The original hood was oversized to allow room for a Naval cap. Early versions were knee-length but later ones were shorter.\n\nThe initial influence of what became the duffel coat, may have been the hooded Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. It had the unusual features of a toggle closure and an integrated hood, and by 1850 had spread through Europe. In the 1850s, British outerwear manufacturer John Partridge developed the first version of the duffle coat.\n\nIn the 1890s the British Admiralty purchased the coat in quantity for the Royal Navy from multiple manufacturers, where it was referred to as the \"convoy coat\". The navy issued a camel-coloured variant during World War I, \nThe character played by Trevor Howard in the 1949 movie \"The Third Man\", British Major Calloway, wears a standard issue Army duffel coat in numerous scenes.\n\nThe design of the coat was modified slightly and widely issued during World War II. It became known under the nickname \"Monty coat\". \n\nLarge post-war stocks of low-cost military surplus coats turned the duffel into a ubiquitous item of British civilian clothing in the 1950s and 1960s, especially among students. The firm Gloverall purchased large quantities, and in 1954 started producing their own version using leather fastenings and buffalo horn toggles with a double-faced check lining, and many other modern versions copy some or all of those features.\n\nToday, the duffel coat is often made of Melton cloth, as opposed to modern duffel cloth which is a softer wool fabric with a distinct nap, used for high-end coats and parkas.\n\nIn Italy as well as in Greece, the duffle coat is called a 'Montgomery', after Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who often wore one during World War II. \n\n"}

The mall extends approximately from George Street to Edward Street, and has more than 700 retailers over of retail space, which includes six major shopping centres. It receives over 26 million visitors each year. It was intended to bring more people into the central business district.\n\nThe mall was designed by Robin Gibson (architect). After being closed to traffic in 1981, the initial pedestrian mall was opened in 1982, in order to be ready for the Brisbane Commonwealth Games. Initially, the section of Queen Street between Albert Street and Edward Street was partitioned off to form a pedestrian-only retail precinct, and it was then extended in 1988 to include the section of Queen Street between Albert Street and George Street, timed to coincide with Brisbane's Expo '88.\n\nThe mall underwent a $25,000,000 refurbishment in 1999, which saw (among other things) the terracotta paving being replaced by granite. The Albert Street section of the mall was refurbished again in 2007. The Brisbane City Council announced in 2009 that Burnett Lane, a narrow laneway that runs between George Street and Albert Street, and parallel to the mall, would be refurbished and integrated into the Queen Street Mall precinct.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the mall was the scene of a 90 minute siege. The offender, Lee Matthew Hillier, had a long criminal history. He was shot several times with non-lethal rounds, ending the incident. He pled guilty to charges including assaulting police and going armed to cause fear. In January 2014 he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail.\n\nThere are a number of shopping centres located in the Queen Street Mall, including:\n\nAt the intersection of Queen Street and Albert Street at the centre of the mall is a steel structure designed to provide shade and cover from the weather. An entertainment stage for music, model shows, and other performances is situated near the George Street end of the mall, between the Myer Centre and the Queen Adelaide Building. The stage is covered by an roof.\n\nUnderneath the Queen Street Mall is the Queen Street Bus Station.\n\nIn the development of stage one and stage two of the mall, significant heritage-listed building facades were preserved, giving the mall a restored yesteryear feeling.\n\nThere are several significant shopping centres located on the Queen Street Mall. These include the Wintergarden (opened in 1982), The Myer Centre (opened in 1988), Broadway on the Mall (opened in 1989) and the lavish Queens Plaza, situated at the northern end of the mall, which was opened in two stages, the first in 2005, and the second in 2008.\nThe Wintergarden is a three level shopping centre with over 70 specialty stores including a gymnasium, ten pin bowling alley, Georg Jensen, Lisa Ho and R. M. Williams. In November 2009, it was announced that the Wintergarden will undergo a A$100 million refurbishment in two 12-month stages. The new Wintergarden will once more become of the Brisbane central business district's premier shopping destinations, and an impressive architectural site.\nThe Myer Centre is the Brisbane CBD's largest shopping centre. It has almost 200 stores spread across 6 floors including Queensland's largest department store, Myer, as well as Target and Birch Carroll and Coyle.\nBroadway on the Mall is a four level shopping centre with around 60 stores. It is closing in August 2013 for refurbishment and is expected to take 18 months to complete.\nQueensPlaza is the Brisbane CBD's most upmarket shopping centre. It has around 80 stores on three levels including Australia's largest single location David Jones department store.\n\nThere are other smaller shopping centres and arcades on the Queen Street Mall. These include the historic Brisbane Arcade, the Q&A Building and the heritage Tattersall's Arcade.\nThe mall also underwent refurbishment in 1999 from its signature terracotta tile footpath to a grey slate tile footpath, with several significant art commissions and new tree and shrub enclosures (with bench seating) throughout.\n\nIn 2006, the other end of the George Street engagement with the Mall ('top of the Mall') saw the opening of Brisbane Square which further extended the grey slate tile rendering of the Mall, and, in 2008 extension of the Mall along Albert Street to the corner of Albert Street and Adelaide Street.\nThe Brisbane City Council announced in 2009 that Burnett Lane, a narrow laneway that runs between George Street and Albert Street, and parallel to the Mall, will be integrated into the Queen Street Mall precinct with a vibrant boutique bar/restaurant scene on the cards.\n\nManagement of the mall was originally covered by the \"Local Government (Queen Street Mall) Act 1981\" (Qld), until it was repealed and replaced by the \"City of Brisbane Act 2010\" (Qld).\n\n"}

Sorcar is an artist in various media, including fine arts, cartoons, animations, laser arts, and world-touring stage shows with live action mixed with laser animation. His animated films, all based on children's stories from India, have won prestigious awards at international film festivals and been broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service for 25 consecutive years. His laser arts and animation in various forms have won global awards from the International Laser Display Association.\n\nSorcar was born on November 29, 1944.\nHe is the eldest son of legendary Indian magician, the late P.C. Sorcar and Basanti Devi. He has two older sisters, Ila and Gita, and two younger brothers Prodip and Provas, both of whom are magicians. He is married to Shikha Devi and has two daughters, Piya and Payal.\n\nIn his youth, Sorcar was a stage assistant for his father's world-touring magic shows, where he also painted backdrops and designed the stage lighting. He chose not to pursue magic as a career as he was more interested in lighting and art, in which he also saw forms of magic.\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering (first class) from the Indian Institute of Technology, BHU, he wanted to see more of the world and came to the United States to pursue higher education in lighting technology and to practice art. He earned his master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington.\n\nSorcar started his professional career as an engineer at Howard W. Butterweck and Company, an electrical consulting engineering firm in Denver, Colorado. After two years, he became a partner, and the firm changed its name to Butterweck-Sorcar Engineering, which later became Sorcar Engineering. Over the course of 40 years under Sorcar's leadership, the company flourished, and completed numerous multimillion-dollar projects, including the Denver International Airport, the Colorado Convention Center, and several sport centers in Japan and Saudi Arabian palaces. During this time, Sorcar authored three widely-used books on lighting design, used as textbooks in US and Indian universities.\n\nSorcar first shot to fame in the nineties when his \"\", India's first animation mixed with live action, received the Gold Plaque at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1990 and was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1991, and \"The Sage and the Mouse\" won the Gold Medal at the International Film Festival of New York in 1993. Other animated films he created include \"The Woodcutter’s Daughter\", which was a finalist at the International Film Festival of New York; \"Sniff\" (\"Gandha Bichar\"), which received the Golden Eagle from CINE; and \"The Rule of Twenty-One\", which won the Bronze Plaque at the Columbus International Film Festival.\n\nStarting in 1999, he began to create new forms of animation using lasers as a medium. His \"Calcutta Forever: A Laser Fantasy\" was recorded as the first laser-documentary screened inside a movie theater. In 2000, he received the \"Excellence in Art Plaque\" from the National Federation of Indian American Associations in New Jersey, for his laser shows \"Dancing with My Soul\" and \"India Forever\". Hosted by the Indian Consulate General of San Francisco for India's 61st Republic Day celebration on January 26, 2010, his laser documentary \"Our Republic's Birth\", which captured India's history starting from 3300 BCE to its independence from the British and proclamation as a Republic Dominion was shown at the historic Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, California.\n\nIn 2012, he produced \"Swamiji\", an hour-long laser documentary on Swami Vivekananda, which was praised by the critics, Ramakrishna Missions and Vedanta Societies around the world for its accurate depiction of Swami Vivekananda's life. The Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math, Howrah, India said \"It was as if he was painting the events of Swamiji's life with a paintbrush before our eyes. It was fascinating.\" about the show which took place on January 31, 2014 at Belur Math campus, attended by 15,000 people.\n\nSorcar is a three-time winner of the ILDA Artistic Award from the International Laser Display Association and is also the first Indian American to ever win this award. He first won in 2006 for his \"Enlightenment of Buddha\", which mixed live-performance with life-size laser animation and three-dimensional visual effects on stage and won the First Place at the 2005 International Laser Display Association award contest. His second win was in 2008, for the laser photography of his laser-art \"Reflection\", which won First Place for laser photography at the 2007 ILDA award contest. His third win was for the innovative application of lasers in his production \"Light Art in Shower Ocean\", which won first place at the 2015 ILDA contest. His 2017 laser animation, \"Beautiful Mess\", won an Award of Merit at the Accolade Global Film Competition.\n\nSorcar has received a number of honors, including the \"Bharat Samman Achievers Award\" at the XXI Annual Meet NRI Divas 2011 of the NRI Institute in New Delhi. In 2011, Jadavpur University opened the \"Manick Sorcar Laser Animation Laboratory\". Sorcar donated laser lab equipment worth more than US$100,000 and introduced the first laser animation course at the university as a special application of lighting for degrees in illumination engineering.\n\nOn November 6, 2013, at Aalen, Germany, he was bestowed with the \"Special Achievement Award for Cultural Enlightenment\" from the International Laser Display Association for exceptional merit in using laser display to celebrate India's heritage, and to prepare the next generation by introducing a course on laser art and animation and establishing the Manick Sorcar Laser Animation Laboratory at Jadavpur University.\n\nOn May 24, 2014, at New Delhi, India, he received the \"IIT-BHU Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award\" for Outstanding Contributions in the Field of Cultural and Enlightenment through Science and Arts.\n\nIn 2015, during the Silver Jubilee celebration for the 25th anniversary of his animation broadcast on PBS, the Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper congratulated Sorcar by writing: \n\nSorcar's art and animation have been the subject of numerous articles, academic research papers, and books.

However, his appointment was interrupted by the Battle of Hong Kong. He became a prisoner of war when then Governor Sir Mark Young surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army on Christmas Day 1941. After spending more than three years in Stanley Internment Camp as an internee, Gimson was freed in August 1945, upon the Liberation of Hong Kong. He formed a short-lived provisional government and briefly declared himself \"acting governor\", but this administration was soon replaced when Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt established the military government following in September.\n\nGimson was the first Governor of Singapore from 1946 to 1952 and reinstalled the civil administration in Singapore. During his governorship, he witnessed the establishment of the legislative council and the executive council in 1947. His governorship was also marked by the increasingly unstable political situation which was provoked by the Malayan Emergency, and the controversial legislation of the Internal Security Act.\n\nGimson was born on 10 September 1890 in Barrow-on-Soar, Leicestershire, England, to the Rev. Charles Keightley Gimson. He attended Balliol College, Oxford, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nGimson entered the British Ceylon Civil Service as a cadet in November 1914. In the beginning he was attached to the Office of the Naval Intelligence Officer in addition to his own duties. Later on he became an additional police magistrate in Colombo. In 1918 he was sent on military service during World War I and returned to the colonial administration as an additional assistant colonial secretary in July 1919. Two months later he was transferred to North Central Province as assistant government agent.\n\nGimson was appointed additional assistant colonial secretary for the second time in March 1920 and was promoted to the post of 4th assistant colonial secretary in September 1920. Subsequently, he was sent to Mannar as acting assistant government agent in February 1922. In February 1924, he was promoted to the Customs Department as landing surveyor and acted as acting deputy controller from March to May in 1928. Gimson left the Customs in March 1929 and was appointed as an additional assistant to the Director of Education. Later in July 1931 he became secretary to the Minister of Education.\n\nIn February 1932, Gimson was appointed assistant government agent of Trincomalee and in December 1933, appointed assistant government agent of Kegalle. In August 1935, he involved in a special duty to help organise the forthcoming general election of members of the state council. Afterwards, he was appointed the chairman of the Municipal Council of Kandy in June 1936 but was eventually given the post of Controller of Labour in 1937. Gimson held this office until 1941 and he gained the rank of class one officer in 1938.\n\nGimson was promoted to the post of Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1941 and arrived at the colony on 7 December, just the day before the Japanese Army initiated its unexpected and sudden large-scale invasion to Hong Kong. The defence forces of Hong Kong soon lost in the Battle of Hong Kong and the then governor, Sir Mark Young, was forced to surrender on 25 December, which is now known as the \"Black Christmas\". After the Japanese victory, all British officials were arrested and were under Japanese rule. Since the Governor was interned elsewhere, Gimson became the representative of the former government who was responsible for dealing with the Japanese over the issue of transfer of power. For some time he even set up a provisional liaison office in Prince's Building, Central.\n\nIn March 1942, Gimson was finally sent to Stanley Internment Camp, where most British colonial officials and expatriates were interned. During the internment, the British civilian internees established the \"British Communal Council\", which tried in a limited way to maintain the life and order in the camp. As the highest-ranking British official in the camp, Gimson became the chairman of the council and was also responsible to negotiate with the Japanese on matters relating to the camp.\n\nAfter three years and eight months of Japanese occupation, the Emperor of Japan finally announced an unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945. Immediately after the unconditional surrender was made, the Japanese authority had to continue to maintain the order of Hong Kong as the Allies were still on the way to take over. However, all the prohibitions and regulations set by the Japanese were entirely lifted and abolished instantly. On the other hand, on the eve of the surrender of Japan, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Horace Seymour, had already tried to make contact with Gimson from Chongqing, urging him to exercise the sovereignty on behalf of the British government. Although Seymour's order arrived late on 23 August, Gimson had declared himself \"acting governor\" and had started to prepare for a \"provisional government\" on 16 August after knowing Japanese had surrendered. Receiving Seymour's order on 23 August, Gimson and other internees left the camp and took over the authority from Japan. Gimson was sworn as acting governor by Chief Justice Atholl MacGregor. He and other former colonial officials set up the headquarters of the provisional government in the Former French Mission Building. On 27 August, Gimson made a further announcement through radio, stating the provisional government had been established. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the provisional rule, the government had to rely on the Japanese troops to maintain the order of Hong Kong since the power of the administration was limited.\n\nOn 30 August 1945, Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt and his warships entered Victoria Harbour. Since Harcourt was asked to form a military government by London, Gimson transferred the power to him and the military government was officially formed on 1 September. Harcourt himself became the head of the military government and Gimson was appointed lieutenant governor by him. Yet, the creation of the office of lieutenant governor was deemed unsuitable by the Colonial Office and therefore Gimson was soon replaced by a chief civil affairs officer and his team sent from London on 7 September. Gimson himself was in fact in poor health as a result of more than three years of internment. For health reasons, he left for the United Kingdom on 16 September. On the day before his departure, he commented in a radio programme that Hong Kong should undergo political reform in the future.\n\nAfter spending some time recovering in the United Kingdom, Gimson became governor and commander-in-chief of Singapore on 1 April 1946. He abolished the military government which had been set up by Lord Louis Mountbatten (as he then was) in 1945, and reinstalled the colonial civil administration. In the first two years of his governorship, the recovery of the economy in Singapore was slow and a large riot broke out in 1947. In June 1947, Singapore became a separate Crown colony and both legislative and executive councils of Singapore were established. In March 1948, Gimson allowed six of the twenty-five seats in the legislative council to be elected.\n\nIn June 1948, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya broke out, and the British imposed harsh measures to control left-wing groups in both Singapore and Malaya; the controversial Internal Security Act, which allowed indefinite detention without trial for persons suspected of being \"threats to security\", was introduced at this time. Since the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government stalled for several years. The colonial government also tried to prevent contact between Singaporean Chinese and the People's Republic of China, which had just fallen under the rule of the Communist Party of China. Tan Kah Kee, a local businessman and philanthropist, was denied re-entry into Singapore after he made a trip to China in 1949.\n\nIn April 1950, Gimson was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt: as he left a boxing event at which he had been presenting prizes in Singapore, a grenade was thrown at him which bounced off his leg and exploded harmlessly some distance away.\n\nA second legislative council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine but the colonial administration was still obviously dominant. Gimson retired from the colonial service the following year, leaving Singapore on the P&O Liner \"Corfu\" on 20 March 1952. He was succeeded in the post of governor by John Nicoll, another former Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong.\n\nGimson spent his time back in the United Kingdom in retirement.

{"id": "2142286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142286", "title": "Critical engine", "text": "Critical engine\n\nThe critical engine of a multi-engine fixed-wing aircraft is the engine that, in the event of failure, would most adversely affect the performance or handling abilities of an aircraft. On propeller aircraft, there is a difference in the remaining yawing moments after failure of the left or the right (outboard) engine when all propellers rotate in the same direction due to the P-factor. On turbojet and turbofan aircraft, there usually is no difference between the yawing moments after failure of a left or right engine.\n\nWhen one of the engines on a typical multi-engine aircraft becomes inoperative, a thrust imbalance exists between the operative and inoperative sides of the aircraft. This thrust imbalance causes several negative effects in addition to the loss of one engine's thrust.\nThe tail-design engineer is responsible for determining the size of vertical stabilizer that will comply with the regulatory requirements for the control and performance of an aircraft after engine failure, such as those set by the Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency. The experimental test pilot and flight-test engineer determine which of the engines is the critical engine during testing.\n\nWhen one engine fails, a yawing moment develops, which applies a rotational force to the aircraft that tends to turn it toward the wing that carries the engine that failed. A rolling moment might develop, due to the asymmetry of the lift in each wing, with a greater lift generated by the wing with the operating engine. The yawing and rolling moments apply rotational forces that tend to yaw and roll the aircraft towards the failed engine. This tendency is counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls, which include the rudder and ailerons. Due to P-factor, a clockwise rotating right-hand propeller on the right wing typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's center of gravity than the clockwise rotating left-hand propeller (Figure 1). The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yawing moment by the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice versa. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a larger yawing moment, the pilot will need to use larger deflections of the flight controls or a higher speed in order to maintain control of the aircraft. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine has a greater impact than failure of the right-hand engine, and the left-hand engine is called the critical engine. On aircraft with propellers that rotate counter-clockwise, such as the de Havilland Dove, the right engine would be the critical engine.\n\nMost aircraft that have counter-rotating propellers do not have a critical engine defined by the above mechanism, because the two propellers are made to rotate inward from the top of the arc; both engines are critical. Some aircraft, such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, purposefully have propellers that rotate outward from the top of the arc, to reduce downward air turbulence, known as downwash, on the central horizontal stabilizer, which makes it easier to fire guns from the aircraft. These engines are both critical, but more critical than inward-rotating propellers.\n\nAircraft with propellers in a push-pull configuration, such as the Cessna 337, may have a critical engine, if failure of one engine has a greater negative effect on aircraft control or climb performance than failure of the other engine. The failure of a critical engine in an aircraft with propellers in a push-pull configuration typically will not generate large yawing or rolling moments.\n\nThe standards and certifications that specify airworthiness require that the manufacturer determine a minimum control speed (V) at which a pilot can retain control of the aircraft after failure of the critical engine, and publish this speed in the section of the airplane flight manual on limitations. The published minimum control speeds (Vs) of the aircraft are measured when the critical engine fails or is inoperative, so the effect of the failure of the critical engine is included in the published Vs. When any one of the other engines fails or is inoperative, the actual V that the pilot experiences in flight will be slightly lower, which is safer, but this difference is not documented in the manual. The critical engine is one of the factors that influences the Vs of the aircraft. The published Vs are safe regardless of which engine fails or is inoperative, and pilots do not need to know which engine is critical in order to safely fly. The critical engine is defined in aviation regulations for the purpose of designing the tail, and for experimental test pilots to measure Vs in flight. Other factors like bank angle and thrust have a much greater effect on Vs than the difference of a critical and a non-critical engine.\n\nThe Airbus A400M has an atypical design, because it has counter-rotating propellers on both wings. The propellers on a wing rotate in opposite directions to each other: the propellers rotate from the top of the arc downward toward each other. If both engines on a wing are operative, the shift of the thrust vector with increasing angle of attack is always towards the other engine on the same wing. The effect is that the resultant thrust vector of both engines on the same wing does not shift as the angle of attack of the airplane increases as long as both engines are operating. There is no total P-factor, and failure of either outboard engine (i.e.: engines 1 or 4) will result in no difference in magnitude of the remaining thrust yawing moments with increasing angle of attack, only in the direction left or right. The minimum control speed during takeoff (V) and during flight (V) after failure of either one of the outboard engines will be the same unless boosting systems that may be required for controlling the airplane are installed on only one of the outboard engines. Both outboard engines would be critical.\nIf an outboard engine fails, such as engine 1 as shown in Figure 2, the moment arm of the vector of the remaining thrust on that wing moves from in between the engines to a bit outside of the remaining inboard engine. The vector itself is 50% of the opposite thrust vector. The resulting thrust yawing moment is much smaller in this case than for conventional propeller rotation. The maximum rudder yawing moment to counteract the asymmetrical thrust can be smaller and, consequently, the size of the vertical tail can be smaller. The feathering system of the large, 8-bladed, 17.5-foot (5.33 m) diameter drag propellers must be automatic, very rapid and failure-free, to ensure the lowest possible propeller drag following a propulsion-system malfunction. If not, a failure of the feathering system of an outboard engine will increase propeller drag, which in turn enhances the thrust yawing moment considerably, thus increasing actual V. The control power generated by the small vertical tail and rudder alone is low by the small design. Only rapid reduction of thrust of the opposite engine, or increased airspeed can restore the required control power to maintain straight flight following the failure of a feathering system. Designing and approving the feathering system for this airplane is challenging for design engineers and certification authorities.\n\nOn airplanes with very powerful engines, the problem of asymmetrical thrust is solved by applying automatic thrust asymmetry compensation, but this has consequences for takeoff performance.\n\nThe Rutan Boomerang is an asymmetrical aircraft designed with engines with slightly different power outputs to produce an aircraft that eliminates the dangers of asymmetric thrust in the event of failure of either of its two engines.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Corus Entertainment. CFSK-DT's studios are located on Robin Crescent on the northwest side of Saskatoon (near the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport), and its transmitter is located on Agra and Settlers Ridge Roads (near Highway 41), northeast of Saskatoon.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Shaw Cable channel 3 and Sasktel Max channel 5. There is a high definition feed offered on Shaw Cable digital channel 211, Sasktel Max channel 305, and Bell TV channel 236.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 6, 1987, under the ownership of Canwest. CFSK and its sister station in Regina, CFRE-TV, were initially branded as \"STV\" (short for \"Saskatchewan Television\"). It joined the Canwest Global System in 1990. At the time that STV went on the air, it was Saskatoon's third locally based over-the-air television station, joining a market that included CTV's CFQC and the then-operational CBC affiliate, CBKST. However, technically it was Saskatoon's second fully licensed station; CBKST was licensed as a rebroadcaster of Regina's CBKT.\n\nCanwest discontinued the STV branding, along with all other individual local station brandings in 1997, when the Global Television Network brand was expanded to all of Canwest's stations. One of STV's major broadcasts in its early years was the children's program \"Size Small Island\" (that show was originally broadcast on sister station CKND-TV in Winnipeg), which was syndicated around the world (the show's host, Helen Lumby, officially launched the mini-network's first broadcast in Saskatoon in 1987). Since the closure of CBKST in 2012, CFSK is one of only two over-the-air broadcast stations originating from Saskatoon.\n\nCFSK-DT presently broadcasts 24½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); it is among the few Global stations (and one of the few television stations in Canada) to carry a prime time newscast during the 10 p.m. hour.\n\nOn December 5, 2011, CFSK-DT debuted a three-hour newscast on weekday mornings (under Global's \"Morning News\" brand), which runs from 6 to 9 a.m. Around the same time, CFSK became the first television station in Saskatoon to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, CFSK expanded its half-hour 10 p.m. newscast to one hour, which was retitled from \"Prime News\" to \"News Hour Final\"; the addition of the morning newscast and the expansion of the prime time newscast is part of an expansion of local news programming on Global owned-and-operated stations across Canada as part of a benefits package that was included as a condition of the sale of the Global Television Network to Shaw Communications.\n\nAs of February 2018, Global Saskatoon's only locally produced newscast is \"Global News Morning\" from 6–9 a.m. \"Global News at 6\", previously anchored by local anchor Julie Mintenko, is now anchored by Global Regina's evening anchor Carlyle Fiset. Weather reports for both Global Regina and Saskatoon are produced by Saskatoon local Peter Quinlan, however. \"Global News at 10\" was anchored by Global Toronto anchors Crystal Goomansingh and Antony Robart from September 2015 until 2018, however it has now returned to Saskatchewan, albeit anchored by Global Regina anchors Carlyle Fiset and Elise Darwish.\n\n\nOn August 15, 2011, 2½ weeks before Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets were slated to transition from analogue to digital broadcasts, CFSK flash cut its digital signal into operation on UHF channel 42.

He is called the \"Root Guru\" by his disciples. Lu claims to be a fully enlightened buddha, known by his disciples as \"Living Buddha Lian-sheng\" (蓮生活佛). He is a writer who has written approximately 232 books to date. As of Feb of 2013, the organization claims over 5,000,000 became Buddhists through Lu.\n\nMembers of the True Buddha School emphasize the necessity to cultivate diligently for the benefit of spiritual advancement, as is practiced in general Vajrayana Buddhism. This is done through empowerment directly from the Root Guru, who himself proclaims to be an emanated being from the Pure Lands shed directly from Vairocana Buddha, then later achieving enlightenment in the human realm through his own rigorous practice and after being given several empowerments from other buddhas and bodhisattvas. A Tantric Buddhist practitioner cannot rely solely on listening or reading spiritual doctrines, or simply worshiping and paying respect to buddhas and bodhisattvas as the method to achieve the goal of spiritual liberation. All students are expected to follow the fourteen Root Tantric Vows (known as Vajrayana samaya) along with the Five Precepts that all Buddhists should follow, and to respect the Root Guru.\n\nThere is a structured curriculum to guide the student's practice, and at each level, a specific yoga is practiced. To advance to the next level, the student must achieve yogic response from the yoga being practiced in the current level and receive empowerment for the yoga of the next level.\n\nAs a beginner, there are specific yogas that are practiced to establish a strong foundation. The yoga practiced in the first stage is Vajrasattva yoga, a great repentance yoga to purify bad karma. The next level is Guru Yoga, followed by Personal Deity yoga and then the inner body practices of energy yoga.\n\nTrue Buddha School has chapters across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America, though the size of each local chapter varies. The main temple is located in Redmond, Washington, it also served as the main residence where Lu resided while he was living in United States. He lived in Tahiti with his wife Lian Hsiang in solitude for six years before re-emerging in the US in 2006, returning to his home in Redmond.\n\nThe majority of the followers of the True Buddha School are located in Asia, and many devotees are from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. Across North America, Australia, and Europe, the majority of the students are immigrants of Asian descent.\n\nTrue Buddha School's funding relies heavily on donations. This is supplemented with the income from the publication of Lu's books and videos of his sermons. The money is used to publish its teaching materials and for charity work such as the South Asian tsunami relief effort. True Buddha School disseminates Buddhist teachings through Lu's sermons, books and articles. These materials are supplemented with sermons and articles by other acharyas (other gurus) certified by the grand master. Lu's books are mainly published in Chinese, with a limited number currently being translated into English. However, more translations are slowly being made to reach a wider audience. Many of the major True Buddha School sadhanas (liturgies) and practices are available in English.\n\nVenerable Hsuan Hua warned his disciples about Lu Sheng-yen's claims, lamenting that many modern people lack wisdom, and dismissing Lu by saying, \"I don't know what this person is. I call him a demon runt.\" Lu was criticized for eating meat, drinking alcohol, and \"playing around with women.\"\n\nDespite being the largest Vajrayana sect in Taiwan, the True Buddha School has been criticized by six Buddhist organizations in Malaysia. \n\nIn 2002, Lu and his temple (Ling Shen Ching Tze Temple) were sued in Washington State by a former member who alleged sexual abuse on the part of Master Lu.\nHowever, because of lack of evidence, the charges did not hold.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in August 1986. ILDA sponsors an annual conference and the annual ILDA Awards for artistic and technical achievement in laser shows and displays.\n\nWhile increasing public awareness of laser light shows, the ILDA is also an association that provides a base for laser display companies. The ILDA does not perform laser light shows itself, but its members primarily consist of laser light show hosts or companies that sell equipment and services. Members of the company can work with each other, not as competitors, but as colleagues with whom they can collaborate. Being associated with ILDA, members can have professional backing that will supply information on new technologies regarding safety issues and improved display performance.\n\nILDA was founded on August 16, 1986, at their first organizational meeting in Lake Tahoe. Those founding members who are still active as of 2006 are Tom Harman of LaserNet, Jim Martin of Peachtree Lase, Walt Meador of Laser Rentals, Inc., Todd Rogers of Beamin’ Lasers, and Tim Walsh of Laser Spectacles. Originally, the meeting was labeled a gathering of Laser Entertainment Professionals. The first topics that were covered at the meeting were ethical business standards, quality shows, CDRH, insurance, standardization, market overview, mission statement, and many more. The first officers were Ron Goldstein as President, Walt Meador as Secretary, and Tim Walsh as Treasurer. At the end of the meeting, each company was able to show off their own laser light creations. The most memorable display was when Laser Media and Image Engineering performed their collaboration to prove that cooperation between laser light companies was possible.\n\nIn April 2006, the ILDA lobbied for the rights to sell lasers for informational display and/or entertainment. This requires persuading the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH; www.FDA.gov/cdrh) to update the administrative process and ensure laser light shows and displays are safer for the public.\n\nWhilst ILDA membership is open to laserists from all countries, ILDA is in essence an American organization that adheres to American laws and standards of safety. Laser safety is imperative where and whenever lasers are being used in public, however laser safety laws in countries with overbearing bureaucractic indulgence i.e. The US inhibit laser professionals from using the technology in a creative fashion.\n\nThe International Laser Display Association developed an image format suitable for interchanging image data between laser controllers and laser fixtures. The information may also be stored as frames, which can then be stored on a computer or other controlling device. Companies in charge of the technical committee of ILDA are LaserMedia, Image Engineering, Foresight, and Laser Dream.\n\nSince ILDA's inception in the early 1990s, profit for large laser display companies, which developed the art form from existing technology, have plummeted. This may be because the technology has become more widespread and affordable\n\nILDA specifies a hardware interface used to control laser projectors. ISP-DB25 is a DB-25 connector governing the X/Y servo position, per-color output, safety isolators etc.\n\nEvery year, the ILDA sponsors a conference and award Ceremony since 1988. These conferences give digital media light show artists the opportunity to network, and showcase their most recent work, while the Award Ceremonies are a place for members to advertise and promote their artistic talent. Companies who have won the most awards are LOBO Electronic, Audio Visual Imagineering, LFI/Laser Fantasy International, Laser Images Inc. (“Laserium”) and Laser Medium. Awards include several different Artistic categories and the Fenning Award, which credits technical achievement. But the highest honor of all is the Career Achievement Award, which is based on years of success, innovation, and over all quality of work.\n\nThe ILDA Conference started in 1987 and ILDA members and non-members can both participate. The Conference holds the ILDA Awards announcements, the Advanced Technology Workshop, a performance of light shows called the “Lase-off,” and seminar and business meetings.\n\n"}

The district contains numerous low and mid-rise heritage buildings once home to the city's automobile dealerships, that today hosts many of the city's top bars and restaurants, retail shops, and urban residences alongside modern construction consisting mostly of residential housing and hotels. Automobile Alley is listed in the National Historic Register of neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2017, Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City, the last auto dealership remaining in Automobile Alley, announced that it would vacate the present site and move to the suburb of Edmond during 2018. After the move, the Automobile Alley site will be converted to other uses.\n\nThe Automobile Alley Historic District was primarily developed as a commercial district just north of downtown Oklahoma City. During the 1920s Automobile Alley, A-Alley for short, was a popular auto row, home to more than 2/3rds of the city's car dealerships for several decades in the 1900s. Numerous national and international brands had showrooms in Automobile Alley and the district thrived as a commercial hub for the state until the decline of downtown Oklahoma City during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nRemnants of the city's auto history still exist in Automobile Alley including urban show-palaces for \"Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City\", \"Jaguar of Oklahoma City\", and \"Volvo of Oklahoma City\", and the \"Bob Moore Auto Group\" is located nearby in MidTown. Today, these luxury icons of the automobile industry coexist alongside numerous retail shoppes, restaurants and bars that have opened in the ground floors of the historic buildings, with office and residential conversions in upper floors.\n\nBroadway Avenue, with a right-of way of , had been shown on the 1889 Oklahoma City plat as the widest street in the city, though it extended only as far as Northwest Fourth Street at the time. Subsequent plats continued the same width. Local legend says that the street was designed to be wide enough to allow a full team of horses and wagons to turn around.\n\nAutomobile Alley has generally defined as the 20 square city block area north of the Oklahoma City CBD, centered along North Broadway Avenue between N. 13th Street to N 4th Street; where the city's prominent automobile retailers had lavish showrooms, regional headquarters, and maintenance facilities. Today's Automobile Alley has expanded to become a true neighborhood (48 square blocks), engulfing the former Triangle/Flatiron District towards the East; now the district boundaries extends roughly from Robinson Avenue to Interstate 235.\n\nHistoric Buildings in Automobile Alley are noted at night for their colorful Neon lighting and advertising displays, including numerous retail signage and building wraps along North Broadway Avenue.\n\nSince the decline of downtown Oklahoma City in the 1980s there have been successive waves of development that have taken place in Automobile Alley. During the mid-1990s, there was an effort to redevelop the district, with the idea to transform many of the automobile showrooms and storefronts of Alley into upscale residential lofts, galleries, and office space. The city implemented a new streets-cape to define the district and numerous smaller companies brought office workers into previously boarded-up historic buildings, bringing the district back to life.\n\nDuring the 2000s there was a push of retail development into the district that began with the relocation of the historic, upscale Colcord Oyster Bar from the renovated Colcord Building in the central business district to an Automobile Alley storefront. Additional destination restaurants soon followed included the opening of the Iguana Lounge Grill, Red PrimeSteak; Oklahoma City's premier Zagat-rated urban steak haunt, and the 2015 openings of the ultra-chic 'Broadway 10 Bar & Chop House' and 'Sidecar' Barley Wine Bar. Since 2010 retail shoppes have made the surge into the district where retailers are converting former automobile showrooms on the lower levels of buildings into retail boutiques including Rawhide, PlenTY Mercantile, The Factory, Perch'd Modern clothiers, and Broadway Wine Merchants. Additional developments are announced seemingly every week, further defining AAlley's position as Oklahoma City's upscale retail destination.\n\nSince 2013 the neighborhood has seen the addition of modern residential and hotel projects as Automobile Alley's Eastern border has expanded toward I-235. Major projects include numerous upper floor loft conversions of the historic building stock (mostly along Broadway and Robinson Avenues), and the 2016 opening of the Metropolitan apartment complex. Additional residential projects are currently under construction or have been announced where the influx of new residents to the area likely may redefine Automobile Alley as a complete urban neighborhood to live, work, and play.\n\nThe last automobile dealership along Automobile Alley, Mercedes-Benz of Oklahoma City at 1225 North Broadway, plans to vacate its premises in 2018 and move to suburban Edmond. The new location will occupy half of a building that was constructed to house Volkswagen of Edmond in 2003. The existing Mercedes-Benz building on Broadway was originally constructed in 1985 by Frank Bolen, a car dealer who opened Benchmark Motors inside. Bolen later sold the business to Bob Howard, who turned it in to Mercedes-Benz of Oklahoma City. Howard recently sold the Mercedes-Benz dealership to Mark Moore,\n"}

He uses the name Ram Jaane after meeting with a priest who in response to the kid asking what his real name was, said \"Ram Jaane\" (God knows). It is the fourth time Shah Rukh Khan played a negative role after \"Baazigar\", \"Darr\" and \"Anjaam\". The film clashed with \"Akele Hum Akele Tum\" starring Aamir Khan. \"Ram Jaane\" released to a positive reception from audiences and was a commercial success, receiving a \"Hit\" verdict. However, \"Akele Hum Akele Tum\" did not enjoy the same and became a \"Flop\" at the box office. Shah Rukh Khan has bought the rights to this film under his banner, Red Chillies Entertainment.\n\nA nameless boy, who was abandoned at a very young age, faces taunts from the other children in his village. He asks the priest what his name is, to which the priest answers \"Ram Jaane\" (God knows), which the boy accepts as his name. Ram Jaane and his friend Murli are caught stealing from a train by a corrupt police officer, Inspector Chewte (Puneet Issar). Chewte beats Ram Jaane in jail, but he is released without charge. Years later, Ram Jaane (Shah Rukh Khan) is working under Sameer Sanvla (Tinnu Anand) – Sanvla is murdered by Chewte and when Ram Jaane attempts to kill Chewie, he is again put in jail and brutally assaulted. When released from prison, Ram Jaane is taken by Murli (Vivek Mushran) to \"Apna Ghar\", a home set up for the homeless – Murli believes that this is the best way to reform him, it is here where Ram Jaane is reunited with his childhood friend Bela (Juhi Chawla), whom he is in love with.\n\nHowever, even in Apna Ghar, Ram Jaane still remains a criminal and even manages to influence the children in the house to follow in his footsteps. Apna Ghar is soon targeted by Baweja (G.P. Singh), who encourages his gang to attack Apna Ghar and all its residents, which Ram Jaane is able to stop. Ram Jaane is then seen shooting Baweja in the head. Chewte learns of Baweja's death and is determined to have his murderer put in prison – he approaches Apna Ghar and starts beating one of the children, which leads to Murli and the others attacking Chewte and his fellow officers. In the riot, one child gets killed. Murli blames Ram Jaane for this tragedy and Ram Jaane runs away, he attempts to make Bela run away with him (as he believes she loves him), but she refuses. Bela is, in fact, in love with Murli – Murli realized this all along and reciprocated her feelings, but did not show it as he realized that Ram Jaane also loved her. Murli begs Bela to attempt to reform Ram Jaane. However, whilst trying to reform him, Bela begins to dislike him for his criminal ways. Bhau (Gulshan Grover), Ram Jaane's rival and Technicolour (Pankaj Kapur), Ram Jaane's former partner in crime hatch a plot to kill Ram Jaane – when he hears of their plan, he kills them both and then rushes to Apna Ghar to stop their henchmen from killing anyone. Eventually, Chewte arrives but is shot by Ram Jaane.\n\nRam Jaane is taken to court where he confesses to all of his sins – the court decides that he must be sentenced to death. The boys of Apna Ghar are in awe of Ram Jaane, as he plans to \"die with a smile.\" The boys think this is courageous and plan to follow in his criminal footsteps. Murli pleads with Ram Jaane not to die bravely, so the boys won't want to follow his path, but Ram Jaane refuses. On the day of his death, with Murli and the boys watching, Ram Jaane feigns fear, crying and pleading for his life. One by one, the boys remove their red headbands, the symbol of being members of Ram Jaane's gang. After his death, Bela and Murli read a letter from Ram Jaane to Bela, which states that he feels guilty for everything he had done and that he had planned intentionally for Bela to leave him and to go back to Murli.\n\n\nThe music is composed by Anu Malik and the songs are written by Anand Bakshi. The soundtrack is on PolyGram (now Universal Music India). Upon release, \"Raam Jaane\" and \"Phenk Hawa Me\" became popular.\n\n\"Ram Jaane\" grossed in India and $200,000 (69.50 lakh) in other countries, for a worldwide total of , against its budget. It had a worldwide opening weekend of , and grossed in its first week.\n\nIt opened on Thursday, November 30, 1995, across 175 screens, along with \"Akele Hum Akele Tum\", starring \"Aamir Khan\". It earned nett on its opening day, and grossed nett in its opening weekend. It had a first week of nett, and grossed nett and nett in its second and third week respectively.

He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, along with Donna Strickland, for the invention of chirped pulse amplification, a technique later used to create ultrashort-pulse, very high-intensity (petawatt) laser pulses.\n\nIn 1994, Mourou and his team at the University of Michigan discovered that the balance between the self-focusing refraction (see Kerr effect) and self-attenuating diffraction by ionization and rarefaction of a laser beam of terawatt intensities in the atmosphere creates \"filaments\" which act as waveguides for the beam thus preventing divergence.\n\nMourou has been director of the Laboratoire d'optique appliquée at the ENSTA from 2005 to 2009. He is a professor and member of Haut Collège at the École polytechnique and A. D. Moore Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan where he has taught for over 16 years. He was the founding director of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of Michigan in 1990. He had previously led a research group on ultrafast sciences at Laboratoire d'optique appliquée of ENSTA and École polytechnique, after obtaining a PhD degree from Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1973. He then went to the United States and became a professor at the University of Rochester in 1977, where he and his then student Donna Strickland produced their Nobel prize-winning work in the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the university. The pair co-invented chirped pulse amplification, a \"method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses\". Strickland's doctoral thesis was on \"development of an ultra-bright laser and an application to multi-photon ionization\".\n\nIn the 2000s, Mourou was featured by a French film company in a publicity video for the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI).\n\nOn 23 November 2015, he attended the Third Christmas Lecture held in Bucharest. His presentation was entitled \"Breaking Through The Unknown: Extreme light, Science to Art\". The previous lectures were given by Sir Thomas Kibble and Joseph Silk.\n\nOn 2 October 2018, Mourou and Strickland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with for their joint work on chirped pulse amplification. They shared half of the Prize, while the other half was awarded to Arthur Ashkin for his invention of \"optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers\".\n\nMourou and Strickland found that stretching a laser out reduced its peak power, which could then be greatly amplified using normal instruments.\nIt could then be compressed to create the short-lived, highly powerful lasers they were after. The technique, which was described in Strickland's first scientific publication, came to be known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). They were probably unaware at the time that their tools would make it possible to study natural phenomena in unprecedented ways. CPA could also per definition be used to create a laser pulse that only lasts one attosecond, one-billionth of a billionth of a second. At those timescales, it became possible not only to study chemical reactions, but what happens inside individual atoms.\n\n\"The Guardian\" and Scientific American provided simplified summaries of the work of Strickland and Mourou: it \"paved the way for the shortest, most intense laser beams ever created\". \"The ultrabrief, ultrasharp beams can be used to make extremely precise cuts so their technique is now used in laser machining and enables doctors to perform millions of corrective\" laser eye surgeries. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged the achievements of Mourou and Strickland: \"Their innovative work can be found in applications including corrective eye surgery, and is expected to have a significant impact on cancer therapy and other physics research in the future\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2142325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142325", "title": "Spanish Army", "text": "Spanish Army\n\nThe Spanish Army (; \"Army of the Land/Ground\") is the terrestrial army of the Spanish Armed Forces responsible for land-based military operations. It is one of the oldest active armies — dating back to the late 15th century, but we could consider a greater antiquity if we take into account that during the in the sixth century with Reccared I, the territorial unity of the Kingdom was achieved, which included the entire Iberian Peninsula , thus finishing the work already begun by his father Liuvigild being the Spanish Visigoth Army in charge of defending the borders of the kingdom especially against the Franks.\n\nThe Spanish Army has existed continuously since the reign of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella (late 15th century). The oldest and largest of the three services, its mission was the defense of Peninsular Spain, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, Melilla, Ceuta and the Spanish islands and rocks off the northern coast of Africa.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Habsburg Spain saw steady growth in its military power. The Italian Wars (1494–1559) resulted in an ultimate Spanish victory and hegemony in northern Italy by expelling the French. During the war, the Spanish Army transformed its organization and tactics, evolving from a primarily pike and halberd wielding force into the first pike and shot formation of arquebusiers and pikemen, known as the \"columella\". During the 16th century, this formation evolved into the tercio infantry formation. \n\nBacked by the financial resources drawn from the Americas, Spain fought wars against its enemies, such as the long-running Dutch Revolt (1568–1609), defending Christian Europe from Ottoman raids and invasions, supporting the Catholic cause in the French civil wars and fighting England during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). The Spanish Army grew in size from around 20,000 in the 1470s to around 300,000 by the 1630s during the Thirty Years' War that tore Europe apart, requiring the recruitment of soldiers from across Europe. With such numbers involved, Spain had trouble funding the war effort on so many fronts. The non-payment of troops led to many mutinies and events such as the Sack of Antwerp (1576), in which 17,000 people died.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) drew in Spain alongside most other European states. Spain entered the conflict with a strong position, but the ongoing fighting gradually eroded her advantages; first Dutch, then Swedish innovations had made the tercio more vulnerable, having less flexibility and firepower than its more modern equivalents. Nevertheless, Spanish armies continued to win major battles and sieges throughout this period across large swathes of Europe. French entry into the war in 1635 put additional pressure on Spain, with the French victory at the Battle of Rocroi in 1643 being a major boost for the French. By the signing of the Peace of Westphalia in 164 8, Spain was forced to accept the independence of the Dutch Republic.\n\nSpain remained an important naval and military power, depending on critical sea lanes stretching from Spain through the Caribbean and South America, and westwards towards Manila and the Far East.\n\nThe Army was reorganized on the French model and in 1704 the old Tercios were transformed into Regiments. The first modern military school (the Artillery School) was created in Segovia in 1764. Finally, in 1768 King Charles III sanctioned the \"Royal Ordinances for the Regime, Discipline, Subordination, and Service in His Armies\", which were in force until 1978.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Bourbon-ruled Spain had an alliance with Bourbon-ruled France and therefore did not have to fear a land war. Its only serious enemy was Britain, which had a powerful Royal Navy; Spain, therefore, concentrated its resources on its Navy. When the French Revolution overthrew the Bourbons, a land war with France became a danger which the king tried to avoid.\n\nIn Spanish Army the officer corps was selected primarily on the basis of royal patronage, rather than merit. About a third of the junior officers had been promoted from the ranks, and they did have talent, but they had few opportunities for promotion or leadership. The rank-and-file were poorly trained peasants. Elite units included foreign regiments of Irishmen, Italians, Swiss, and Walloons, in addition to elite artillery and engineering units.The army lacked its own horses, oxen, and mules for transportation, so these auxiliaries were operated by civilians, who might run away if conditions looked bad. In combat, small units fought well, but their old-fashioned tactics were hard of use against the French \"Grande Armée\", despite repeated desperate efforts at last-minute reform.\n\nSpain entered the 19th century with a reduction of territory and recognition of power in Europe following the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and faced renewed problems in the international arena. The Spanish military was devastated as a consequence of its former alliance with France, costing it its main fleets and many war damages in its military arsenals and weapons factories, much of which was inflicted by the British or Portuguese allies during the Peninsular campaign to prevent the French or Spanish to resume their services after the war. In the immediate aftermath of the war, while its administration was facing local rebellions against a renewed absolutist monarchy, the overseas colonies inspired by France and the United States of America sought to wrestle control from the debilitated European government that demanded more taxes to rebuild itself after the Napoleonic period disasters. Many continental armies were sent to Central America and South America which proved to be futile and too late. The former Empire lost an important artery of its power and with it the wealth in revenues which it had become dependent on over the centuries. In response, attempts were made to reform the military into a modern and standing national force, with conscription being adopted.\n\nSpain faced a series of internal dynastic conflicts, collectively known as the Carlist Wars, requiring Spain to undergo a series of reforms directed at its military, administrative, and social structures. As consequence of these internal conflicts, and the weakness of the central structures of government under the monarchy, many generals with political ambitions would interrupt public life in multiple Coup d'états, known as Pronunciamientos, for the rest of the century until the Second Restoration of the Bourbons in Spain under Alfonso XII. These series of military interruptions in civil government eventually shaped a permissive cultural and political mentality, with a tacit expectation of \"special emergency interventions\" from the military that would pervade well into the first third of the 20th century. In the year 1920 the Spanish army was composed of about 500,000 men. ultimately ending up in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nDuring the Second Spanish Republic, the Spanish government enlisted over ten million men to the army.\n\nSome US citizens came to Spain to fight in their civil war for two main reasons. The first being to promote their ideals and the other being to escape the trials of living in America during the great depression.\n\nThe Americans totaled 2,800 and suffered heavy casualties: 900 killed and 1,500 wounded.\n\nThis period can be divided in four phases:\n\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the Spanish (Francoist) Army counted with 1,020,500 men, in 60 Divisions. During the first year of peace, Franco dramatically reduced the size of the Spanish Army to 250,000 in early 1940, with most soldiers two-year conscripts. \nA few weeks after the end of the war, the eight traditional Military Regions (Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Barcelona, Zaragoza, Burgos, Valladolid, La Coruña) were reestablished. In 1944 a ninth Military Region, with HQ in Granada, was created. The Air Force became an independent service, under its own Air Ministry.\n\nConcerns about the international situation, Spain's possible entry into World War II, and threats of invasion led him to undo some of these reductions. In November 1942, with the Allied landings in North Africa and the German occupation of Vichy France bringing hostilities closer than ever to Spain's border, Franco ordered a partial mobilization, bringing the army to over 750,000 men. The Air Force and Navy also grew in numbers and in budgets, to 35,000 airmen and 25,000 sailors by 1945, although for fiscal reasons Franco had to restrain attempts by both services to undertake dramatic expansions.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Spanish Army had eight Army Corps, with two or three Infantry Division each. Additionally, there were two Army Corps in Northern Africa, the Canary Islands General Command and the Balearic Islands General Command, one Cavalry Division and the Artillery's General Reserve. In 1940 a Reserve Group, with three Divisions, was created.\n\nAlthough Spanish caudillo Francisco Franco was neutral and did not bring Spain into World War II on the side of Nazi Germany, he permitted volunteers to join the German Army (Wehrmacht) on the condition they would only fight against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, and not against the Western Allies or any Western European occupied populations. In this manner, he could keep Spain at peace with the Western Allies, while repaying German support during the Spanish Civil War and providing an outlet for the strong anti-Communist sentiments of many Spanish nationalists. Officially designated as División Española de Voluntarios by the Spanish Army and as 250 Infanterie-Division in the German Army,The Blue Division was the only component of the German Army to be awarded a medal of their own, commissioned by Hitler in January 1944 after the Division had demonstrated its effectiveness in impeding the advance of the Red Army, is known its intervention in battle of Krasny Bor Volkhov front (October 1941 – August 1942) and siege of Leningrad (August 1942 – October 1943).\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the Spanish Army counted 22,000 officers, 3,000 NCO and almost 300,000 soldiers. The equipment dated from the Civil War, with some systems produced in Germany during the World War. Doctrine and Training were obsolete, as they had not incorporated the teachings of the Second World War. This situation lasted until the agreements with the United States in September 1953.\n\nAfter the signature of the military agreement with the United States in 1953, the assistance received from Washington allowed Spain to procure more modern equipment and to improve the country's defence capabilities. More than 200 Spanish officers and NCOs received specialised training in the United States each year under a parallel program. With the Barroso Reform (1957), the Spanish Army abandoned the organisation inherited from the Civil War to adopt the United States' pentomic structure. In 1958 three experimental pentomic Infantry Divisions were created (Madrid, Algeciras, Valencia). In 1960, five more pentomic Infantry Divisions (Gerona, Málaga, Oviedo, Vigo, Vitoria) and four mountain Divisions were created. All in all, after the Barroso Reform, the Spanish Army had 8 pentomic Infantry Divisions, four Mountain Divisions, one Armoured Division, one Cavalry Division, three independent Armoured Brigades and three Field Artillery Brigades.\n\nThe 1965 Reforms were inspired by contemporary French organisation and Doctrine of the era. The Army was grouped into two basic categories: the Immediate Intervention Forces (Field Army) and the Operational Defence Forces (Territorial Army) and were divided into the following:\n\n\nDuring the last years of the Francoist regime, contemporary weapons were ordered for the Spanish Army. In 1973, the military education system was reformed in depth, in order to make its structure and objectives similar to those existing in the civilian universities. It was during this time that the Spanish Army fought in the campaigns in what is now Western Sahara against Arab forces in the area who agitated for the end of Spanish colonial rule.\n\nThree main events characterise this period: creation of a single Ministry of Defence (1977) to replace the three existing military ministries (Army, Navy and Air Ministries), the failed coup d'état in February 1981 and the accession to NATO in 1982.\n\nThe Army modernisation program (META plan) was done between 1982 and 1988 in order for Spain to achieve full compliance with NATO standards. When the plan was completed the following results were achieved:\n\n\nThe end of the Cold War came with the reduction of the term of military service for conscripts until its complete abolition in 2001 and the increasing participation of Spanish forces in multinational peacekeeping operations abroad are the main drivers for changes in the Spanish Army after 1989. Three reorganisation plans were implemented since: the RETO plan (1990), the NORTE plan (1994) and the Instruction for Organisation and Operation of the Army (IOFET) 2005.\n\nIn 2001, when compulsory military service was still in effect, the army was about 135,000 troops (50,000 officers and 86,000 soldiers). Following the suspension of conscription the Spanish Army became a fully professionalised volunteer force and by 2008 had a personnel strength of 75,000. In case of a war or national emergency, an additional force of 80,000 \"Civil Guards\" comes under the Ministry of Defence command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Source: \"\n\n\n\nThe military ranks of the Spanish army are as follows below.

It serves 28 stations in Antioch, Pittsburg, Bay Point, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Orinda, Oakland, San Francisco, Daly City, Colma, South San Francisco, San Bruno, and Millbrae. The line is colored yellow on maps, and BART has begun to call it the Yellow Line.\n\nThe line is split into two segments. The majority of the line uses the same electric multiple unit trains as the rest of BART, and shares tracks with the five other mainline services. The section from Antioch to near Pittsburg/Bay Point station, known as eBART, uses diesel multiple units. A cross-platform transfer between the two modes is made at a dedicated transfer platform east of Pittsburg/Bay Point station. However, the line is shown on maps as one route, and headsigns and station information display the ultimate terminus of the line.\n\nThe line is extended to Millbrae station on nights and Saturdays when it is not served by the Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae line and SFO–Millbrae line. It is the most-used BART line, and the only line with additional short turn trains to provide additional service to core areas during weekday peak hours.\n\nThe Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line was the second of BART's five rapid transit lines to open. Service from Concord to MacArthur began on May 21, 1973. The line was extended to Daly City when the Transbay Tube opened on September 16, 1974. The North Concord/Martinez, Colma, and Pittsburg/Bay Point stations were added in 1995–1996.\n\nUntil 2015, rush hour service included trains that short turned at Concord; these trains originated at Montgomery Street during the morning peak and returned to 24th Street Mission during the evening peak. On April 1, 2015, BART fully opened the Central Contra Costa Crossover, a pair of crossover tracks south of Pleasant Hill/Contra Costa Centre station that allow trains to terminate there. On September 14, 2015, the Concord short turns were cut to Pleasant Hill to allow for increased frequency. Reverse peak \"Pleasant Hill Limited\" trains bypassed Rockridge, Orinda, Lafayette, and Walnut Creek stations eastbound in the morning peak, and Lafayette and Orinda westbound in the evening. The short turn trains were re-extended to Concord on February 10, 2020. As of April 2020, the extra commute trains are temporarily eliminated due to ridership decreases caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn March 2016, mysterious electrical surges caused several cars to be taken out of service on the tracks north of North Concord/Martinez station. On March 16, 2016, BART halted service to Pittsburg/Bay Point station and established a bus bridge between North Concord and Pittsburg/Bay Point. Limited service to Pittsburg/Bay Point resumed on March 21 and full service resumed on April 2.\n\nWhen the SFO/Millbrae extension opened on June 22, 2003, BART extended the Pittsburg/Bay Point–SFO/Millbrae line to Millbrae but bypassed San Francisco International Airport station (SFIA). BART rerouted this line to SFIA in place of the Dublin/Pleasanton line on February 9, 2004, with service extended to Millbrae outside of weekday peak hours. San Mateo County is not a member of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, so SamTrans funded the county's BART service. When the extension's lower-than-expected ridership caused SamTrans to accrue deficits, BART agreed to SamTrans' request to operate only the Dublin/Pleasanton line south of Daly City effective September 12, 2005.\n\nSamTrans and BART reached an agreement in February 2007 in which SamTrans would transfer control and financial responsibility of the SFO/Millbrae extension to BART, in return for BART receiving additional fixed funding from SamTrans and other sources. In January 2008, BART re-extended the line to SFIA at all times, and in September 2009, trains were further extended to Millbrae on evenings and weekends. As of February 10, 2020, the Antioch line again terminates at SFIA at all times. Antioch line and SFO-Millbrae line trains are interlined on Sundays, with no transfer required at SFIA.\n\nBART to Antioch, named during construction and commonly known as eBART (East Contra Costa BART Extension), is a diesel multiple unit (DMU) light rail branch line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in eastern Contra Costa County, California, United States. Service starts at Pittsburg/Bay Point station and extends to Antioch station.\n\nTrains and tracks for the portion of the Antioch – SFO/Millbrae line between Antioch and Pittsburg/Bay Point are incompatible with those of the main BART rapid transit system, making it impossible for trains to move between the two systems; instead, passengers transfer via a cross platform interchange at an auxiliary BART stop at Pittsburg/Bay Pointthe BART to Antioch platform is accessible only via an intra-station ride from the main station to this auxiliary stop. The first extension proceeds east along the State Route 4 corridor to the city of Antioch at a Hillcrest Avenue station. Revenue service began on May 26, 2018.\n\nThe BART map does not differentiate between this service and the remainder of the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line.

It has 18 stations in Dublin, Pleasanton, Castro Valley, San Leandro, Oakland, San Francisco, and Daly City. The line is colored blue on maps, and BART has begun to call it the Blue Line. Some Sunday daytime service on the line terminates at Montgomery Street station.\n\nOf BART's five primary rapid transit services, the Dublin/Pleasanton–Daly City line was the most recent to open. Service began when the Dublin/Pleasanton extension opened on May 10, 1997. The West Dublin/Pleasanton infill station was added to the line on February 19, 2011.\n\nWhen the SFO/Millbrae extension opened on June 22, 2003, BART extended the Dublin/Pleasanton–Daly City line to SFO. BART truncated this line back to Daly City and rerouted the Pittsburg/Bay Point line to SFO in its place on February 9, 2004. San Mateo County is not a member of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, so SamTrans funded the county's BART service. When the extension's lower-than-expected ridership caused SamTrans to accrue deficits, BART agreed to SamTrans' request to operate only this line south of Daly City effective September 12, 2005.\n\nSamTrans and BART reached an agreement in February 2007 in which SamTrans would transfer control and financial responsibility of the SFO/Millbrae extension to BART, in return for BART receiving additional fixed funding from SamTrans and other sources. BART has since again increased service south of Daly City, but this line now terminates at Daly City.\n\nOn February 11, 2019, the line began operating between MacArthur station and Dublin/Pleasanton station on Sundays. The change was to allow single-tracking in the Market Street Subway during electrical work, with only the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line running through the Transbay Tube to serve San Francisco. Sunday service to San Francisco resumed on February 16, 2020. Trains terminate at Montgomery station during single-tracking work and Daly City at other times.\n"}
{"id": "2142369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142369", "title": "Empires of the Middle Ages", "text": "Empires of the Middle Ages\n\nEmpires of the Middle Ages is a board game for two to six players which simulates grand strategy and diplomacy in the Middle Ages. It was first released by Simulations Publications, Inc. in 1980.\n\nEach player in EOMA controls an empire composed of areas, each of which is rated for wealth, religion, language and population. The talents of each empire's current ruler are represented by numerical ratings for warfare, administration, and diplomacy. The object of the game is essentially to grow an empire in terms of wealth, geography and stability.\n\n\"Empires of the Middle Ages\" was designed by James Dunnigan, a prolific game designer and writer. However, often a Dunnigan design would consist of no more than a four-page outline on a legal pad and a developer would then take over, doing a strong majority of the work and completing the project. In this case, this was done by Anthony F. Buccini who also received a designer's credit. A third design credit went to Redmond A. Simonsen, who was responsible for all the graphical features of the game and likely played a significant role in development as well.\n\nThe game is played in turns representing five years, and each player may attempt one endeavor for each year. Endeavors may be diplomatic, economic (such as taxation) or military in nature. Central to the game are two decks of cards, Event and Year cards. Event cards create random events such as plague, famine or schism, while Year cards are used to resolve endeavors. A key element is the ever-present possibility of civil unrest and other military and political threats.\n\nThe full campaign game begins in the year 770 (the accession of Charlemagne) and continues to about 1475. Smaller scenarios begin with the historical situation in a particular year and cover a century or two.\n\nAt the time of release, the game was unusual in that it did not use army counters to represent military assets in the game. Instead, military action was carried out as an endeavor, an abstract action, with success depending mainly on the military skill of the ruler and the relative strengths of the target area and the area from which the attack was launched.\n\nThe game quickly achieved cult status after it went out of print when SPI folded and was bought by TSR. A DOS computer version of the board game was released around 1990 under the name \"Rise of the West\". TSR and its subsequent owners have sold the rights to a number of games to other publishers; Decision Games bought the rights to Empires of the Middle Ages, and updated and re-released the game in 2004.\n\nDecision Games reprinted the game in 2014.\n\n\"Empires of the Middle Ages\" was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for \"Best Pre-20th Century Game of 1980\".\n\nTimothy Brown comments: \"The game stands out for its innovative balance of mechanics and graphics, guaranteeing an enjoyable session every time.\"\n\nThe game was evidently popular enough for SPI to release a follow-on game called The Sword and the Stars that employed a modified version of the same systems, setting the theme in an outer space future.\n\n"}
{"id": "2142370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142370", "title": "WASH-1400", "text": "WASH-1400\n\nWASH-1400, 'The Reactor Safety Study', was a report produced in 1975 for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by a committee of specialists under Professor Norman Rasmussen. It \"generated a storm of criticism in the years following its release\". In the years immediately after its release, WASH-1400 was followed by a number of reports that either peer reviewed its methodology or offered their own judgments about probabilities and consequences of various events at commercial reactors. In at least a few instances, some offered critiques of the study's assumptions, methodology, calculations, peer review procedures, and objectivity. A succession of reports, including NUREG-1150, the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses and others, have carried-on the tradition of PRA and its application to commercial power plants.\n\nThe report correctly foresaw the impact a tsunami could have on a nuclear power station. It concluded that \"Some plants are located on the sea shore where the possibility of tsunami, and waves and high water levels due to hurricanes exist. The plant design in these cases must accommodate the largest waves and water levels that can be expected. Such events were assessed to represent negligible risks.\" (Section 5.4.6 \"Other external causes\")\n\nWASH-1400 considered the course of events that might arise during a serious accident at a (then) large modern Light water reactor. It estimated the radiological consequences of these events, and the probability of their occurrence, using a fault tree/event tree approach. This technique is called Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA). The report concluded that the risks to the individual posed by nuclear power stations were acceptably small, compared with other tolerable risks. Specifically, the report concluded, using the methods and resources and knowledge available at the time, that the probability of a complete core meltdown is about 1 in 20,000 per reactor per year.\n\nThe study was peer-reviewed by the 'Lewis Committee' in 1977, which broadly endorsed the methodology as the best available, but cautioned that the risk figures were subject to large uncertainty.\n\nThe methods used were comparatively simple by today's standards and based on early understanding of key phenomenology. Amidst a period of intensive (and extensive) research and discussion, inspired in part by the Three Mile Island accident, work continued on PRA including NUREG-1150 and an ongoing study being performed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA). Specific Studies were also made of two plants at Zion and Indian Point—the so-called Z/IP Study.\n\nThe PRA methodology became generally followed as part of the safety-assessment of all modern nuclear power plants. In the 1990s, all U.S. nuclear power plants submitted PRAs to the NRC under the Individual Plant Examination program , and five of these were the basis for the 1991 NUREG-1150.\n\nAccording to Table 6-3 on pg. 112 of WASH-1400, individual persons have a less than 1 in 5,000,000,000 (Tbl 6-3, pg. 112) chance of dying on a yearly basis from the operation of 100 nuclear power plants in the United States. This is less than yearly risk of being struck by lightning and being killed (1 in 20,000,000, Tbl 6-3, pg. 112), being in a fatal auto collision (1 in 3,000 chance of dying, Tbl 6-3, pg. 112), or any other accident risk mentioned in WASH-1400.\n\nWASH-1400 is now NUREG-75/014.\n\nIn the years since its publication, WASH-1400 has occasioned much discussion of its methods and has seen the rise of competing judgments about the probabilities and consequences of adverse events in commercial nuclear power reactors. A panel of scientists organized by the American Physical Society (APS) \"found much to criticize\" in the WASH-1400 report. The panel noted that fatality estimates had considered only deaths during the first 24 hours after an accident, although other pathways (e.g., via radioactive cesium) could result in environmental exposures after the acute phase of an accident and could expose large populations to adverse effects, albeit at small doses. Any cancers that might arise might not show up until years after the accident. The APS reviewers also criticized the report’s methods for predicting the performance of emergency cooling systems.\n\nOne particular focus of discussion has been the size of the probabilities, posited in WASH-1400, of the occurrence of the various accidents and events. While a 1982 report by Science Applications Inc. (SAI) found those of WASH-1400 to be underestimates, a contemporaneous report by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators found SAI's to be too high by a factor of 30.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists released a 150-page report critiquing the WASH-1400 report, and in June 1976, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment held hearings on the validity of the report's findings. As a result of these hearings, NRC agreed to have a review group examine the validity of the report's conclusions.\n\nIn a 1978 report, the review group appointed by the NRC and led by Professor Harold Lewis of the University of California concluded that \"the uncertainties in WASH-1400's estimates of the probabilities of severe accidents were in general, greatly understated\". Rassmussen observed that the likelihood of a core melt, as estimated in WASH-1400 and NUREG 1150, were in close agreement and their uncertainty bands overlapped.\n\nIn 1979, The NRC issued a policy statement in which it accepted numerous criticisms of WASH-1400 raised by the Lewis Report, and it withdrew any endorsement of the executive summary.\n\n\n"}

The Seventh-day Adventist church recognises the contribution made by these organisations as being such that the main church is unable to contribute to. The organizations adhere to official church guidelines and do not openly solicit tithe or solicit money from members during official functions.\n\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church owns and operates many publishing companies around the world including one of the largest located in the United States: Pacific Press Publishing Association.\n\nMany private organizations also print, publish, and promote materials supporting the Seventh-day Adventist message. The largest of these is TEACH Services, Inc.\n\nOne of the first vegan cookbooks, \"Ten Talents\" (1968), was written by a church member, Rosalie Hurd. The title refers to a quote from Ellen White, \"The one who understands the art of properly preparing food, and who uses this knowledge, is worthy of higher commendation than those engaged in any other line of work. This talent should be regarded as equal in value to ten talents\".\n\nAdventists have long been proponents of media-based ministries. Traditional Adventist evangelistic efforts consisted of street missions and the distribution of tracts such as The Present Truth, which was published by James White as early as 1849. Until J. N. Andrews was sent to Switzerland in 1874, Adventist global efforts consisted entirely of the posting of tracts such as White's writings to various locations.\n\nIn the last century, these media based efforts have also made use of emerging media such as radio and television. The first of these was H. M. S. Richards' radio show The Voice of Prophecy, which was initially broadcast in Los Angeles in 1929. Since then Adventists have been on the forefront of media evangelism, and one program, It Is Written, founded by George Vandeman, was the first religious program to air on colour television and was the first major Christian ministry to utilize satellite uplink technology.\n\nThe \"Three Angels Broadcasting Network\" was founded in 1984 by Danny Shelton. Troubled by what he saw on Christian television, Shelton was inspired to \"build the television and radio networks that would reach the world with the undiluted three angels' messages of Revelation 14 - the networks that would counteract the counterfeit.\" Eventually, this would develop into a major 24-hour satellite service seen around the world, consisting of 3ABN (English) television network, 3ABN Radio Network, and 3ABN Latino (Spanish) Network. \"3ABN\" (as it is often called) broadcasts programming from all the major Seventh-day Adventist ministries, as well as its own productions covering religious, health, children, and music programming. This organization is a privately run non-profit organization, and is a supporting ministry (not an official part) of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\n\nSee also \"Issues: The Seventh-day Adventist Church and Certain Private Ministries\", published in 1992 by the North American Division.\n\n"}

{"id": "2142376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142376", "title": "Fat Possum Records", "text": "Fat Possum Records\n\nFat Possum Records is an American independent record label based in Water Valley and Oxford, Mississippi. At first Fat Possum focused almost entirely on recording previously unknown Mississippi blues artists (typically from Oxford or Holly Springs, Mississippi). Recently, Fat Possum has signed younger rock acts to its roster. The label has been featured in \"The New York Times\", \"New Yorker\", \"The Observer\", a Sundance Channel production, features on NPR, and a 2004 documentary, \"You See Me Laughin\". Fat Possum also distributes the Hi Records catalog.\n\nFat Possum was founded in 1991 by \"Living Blues\" editor Peter Redvers-Lee, who went to the University of Mississippi for his MA studies in Journalism. He planned on starting a record label and picked the name with another student, Billy \"Pup\" Cochrane. Co-founder Matthew Johnson, who grew up in the state, was also a student at the University of Mississippi. By 1994 or so Lee left, and freelance recording engineer Bruce Watson assumed his managerial role. An early investor was John Hermann of Widespread Panic, who also pitched Robert Palmer's name as producer.\n\nThe label initially specialised in discovering blues players from the North Mississippi region, many of whom had never recorded before. At Fat Possum's behest some artists, particularly R. L. Burnside, released both standard blues albums and more techno albums, done in the style that would later be made famous by Moby's album \"Play\". This led to a fair amount of controversy among blues purists, a group in which Johnson was largely uninterested. Many of the early artists for Fat Possum were picked with the aid of Palmer (previously a teacher of Johnson at the University of Mississippi), who also produced a number of records for the label.\n\nAlthough their releases were critically acclaimed, particularly Junior Kimbrough's album \"All Night Long\", which received 4 stars from \"Rolling Stone\" and the loud approval of Iggy Pop, In 1995 they added Arkansas bluesman John \"So Blue\" Weston to their roster, with \"So Doggone Blue\" (FP 1003) produced by Living Blues writer Larry Hoffman. Disputes between the artist and label resulted in Hoffman buying back the master and selling it to Evidence Records (UPC: 730182609226) Fat Possum was perennially strapped for cash. Word of mouth and artist compilations, such as \"Not the Same Old Blues Crap 3\" (with a cover illustration by Joe Sacco) and \"All Men Are Liars\", gradually pulled Fat Possum out of the red, even if only for brief periods of time. A legal fight with Capricorn Records, who were to be their distributor, drained Fat Possum's funds and left a number of projects on the shelf.\n\nBurnside proved early on to be the label's biggest money maker. Having released two albums, he teamed with The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for a tour, and then recorded with the band \"A Ass Pocket of Whiskey\", which helped Burnside and Fat Possum gain wider recognition. A remix of the R. L. Burnside song, \"It's Bad You Know\", was also featured prominently on \"The Sopranos\".\n\nWith time, many of the label's artists have died. Asie Payton, King Ernest, and Charles Caldwell died before their records could be released. Kimbrough died in 1998 and Burnside 2005. T-Model Ford and Robert Belfour joined in the 2010s.\n\nResponding to the first deaths, Fat Possum begun to release more archival records. George Mitchell's recordings came out first as individual albums of Furry Lewis, Mississippi Joe Callicott, R.L. Burnside, Townes Van Zandt, and others, with covers designed by Chip Kidd, and then in bulk as the \"George Mitchell Collection\".

It was also known as GNPO \"Trud\" and Kuybyshev Engine Design Bureau (KKBM).\n\nBy the early 2000s the lack of funding caused by the poor economic situation in Russia had brought Kuznetsov on the verge of bankruptcy. In 2009 the Russian government decided to consolidate a number of engine-making companies in the Samara region under a new legal entity. This was named JSC Kuznetsov, after the design bureau.\n\nThe Kuznetzov Bureau first became notable for producing the monstrous Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop engine that powered the Tupolev Tu-95 bomber beginning in 1952 as a development of the Junkers 0022 engine. The new engine eventually generated about 15,000 horsepower (11.2 megawatts) and it was also used in the large Antonov An-22 Soviet Air Force transport.\n\nKuznetsov also produced the Kuznetsov NK-8 turbofan engine in the class that powered the Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-154 airliners. This engine was next upgraded to become the about Kuznetsov NK-86 engine that powered the Ilyushin Il-86 aircraft. This Bureau also produced the Kuznetsov NK-144 afterburning turbofan engine. This engine powered the early models of the Tupolev Tu-144 SST.\n\nThe Kuznetsov Design Bureau also produced the Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofan engine that was used on the Lun-class ekranoplan. (Only one such aircraft has ever been produced.)\n\nKuznetsov's most powerful aviation engine is the Kuznetsov NK-321 that propels the Tupolev Tu-160 bomber and was formerly used in the later models of the Tu-144 supersonic transport (an SST that is now obsolete and no longer flown).

The result was the NK-9, one of the first staged-combustion cycle rocket engines. The design was developed by Kuznetsov into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines in the 1960s, and claimed them to be the highest-performance rocket engines ever built, which were to propel the N1 lunar rocket—one that was never successfully launched. As of 2011, the aging NK-33 remains the most efficient (in terms of thrust-to-mass ratio) LOX/Kerosene rocket engine ever created.\n\nThe Orbital Sciences Antares light-to-medium-lift launcher has two modified NK-33 in its first stage, a solid second stage and a hypergolic orbit stage. The NK-33s are first imported from Russia to the United States and then modified into Aerojet AJ26s, which involves removing some harnessing, adding U.S. electronics, qualifying it for U.S. propellants, and modifying the steering system.\n\nThe Antares rocket was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on April 21, 2013.

The poem is the fifth of a series of poems entitled \"1914 and Other Poems\".\n\nIt is often contrasted with Wilfred Owen's 1917 antiwar poem \"Dulce et Decorum est\". The manuscript is located at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nWritten with fourteen lines in a Petrarchan/Italian sonnet form, the poem is divided into an opening octet, and then followed by a concluding sestet. As far as rhyme scheme, the octet is rhymed after the Shakespearean/Elizabethan (ABAB CDCD) form, while the sestet follows the Petrarchan/Italian (EFG EFG) form. The volta, the shift or point of dramatic change, occurs after the fourth line where Brooke goes from describing the death of the soldier, to his life accomplishments.inning of the First World War in 1914, as part of a series of [[sonnet],]s written by Rupert Brooke. Brooke himself, predominantly a prewar poet, died the year before \"The Soldier\" was published. \"The Soldier\", being the conclusion and the finale to Brooke’s \"1914\" war sonnet series, deals with the death and accomplishments of a soldier.\n\nThis sonnet encompasses the memoirs of a deceased soldier who declares his patriotism to his homeland by declaring that his sacrifice will be the eternal ownership of England of the small portion of land where his body is buried. The poem appears to not follow the normal purpose of a Petrarchan/Italian sonnet either. It does not truly go into detail about a predicament/resolution, as is customary with this form; rather, the atmosphere remains constantly in the blissful state of the English soldier.\n\nThe poem is read aloud twice in the 1969 film, [[Oh! What a Lovely War]]. The first time, the poem is read in its entirety by a soldier writing it in the trenches. The second time, a different soldier reads from a paper that 70% casualties occurred at the last battle, and recites the beginning lines, \"That there's some corner of a foreign field that is for ever England.\" \n\nLyrics in [[Roger Waters]]' “[[The Gunner's Dream]]” (from the [[Pink Floyd]] album \"[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]\") make reference to “The Soldier”.\n\nImplicit references to this poem (and several others) are made in [[Muse (band)|Muse's]] song “[[Soldier's Poem]]” from their album \"[[Black Holes & Revelations]]\".\n\nPrior to the [[Apollo 11|first moon landing]] in 1969, [[William Safire]] prepared a speech for [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] to give in case of disaster. The last line of the prepared address intentionally echoes a similar line from the poem. (\"For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.\") This line is in reference to the first few lines of the poem.\n\nThe Second World War fiction novel \"Under an English Heaven\", by Robert Radcliffe, tells the story of a [[Flying Fortress]] bomber crew in the [[USAAF]] 520th Bombardment Group, based on a [[Suffolk]] airbase. The novel takes its title directly from this piece, and although not mentioning the poem directly, comparisons are drawn between \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" and particular bombing missions over occupied Europe which elicited a very high casualty rate, underlining the futility of the survival odds for any given bomber crew.\n\nEnglish singer songwriter [[Al Stewart]] makes reference to Brooke in his song \"Somewhere in England (1915)\" from the album \"[[A Beach Full of Shells]]\": “And the maker of rhymes on the deck who is going to die, in the corner of some foreign field that will make him so famous, as the light temporarily shines to illumine his pages.”\n\nThe poem is used as the theme for \"The Listener\" Crossword 4343, \"Bear, Bear Bearing\". The title hints at \"Rupert Brook-e\", and features from the poem are hidden in the grid. \n\nIn the \"[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]\" episode \"[[Major Star]]\", Captain Blackadder says \"If I should die, think only this of me, I'll be back to get you.\"\n\nIn the film \"[[All the King's Men (1999 film)|All the King's Men]]\" the poem is twice quoted verbatim: once early in the story as the inexperienced soldiers boast of coming glorious death in battle and again near the end at the funeral of a soldier killed in Gallipoli. The contrast in these two recitations (in tone, character, setting, purpose) illustrates the nuance of the poem beyond any patriotism/anti-war dichotomy. \n\n\n[[Category:World War I poems]]\n[[Category:1914 poems]]"}

He toured South Africa with a revue company in 1921 and appeared as a boy vocalist at Collins' Music Hall the following year. Minor successes in music hall, revues and working men's clubs followed. By 1926, aged 17, Trinder was the star of Archie Pitt's travelling variety comedy shows.\n\nNational recognition began to come in 1937 with the revues \"Tune In\" and \"In Town Tonight\". By the time of the Second World War he was one of Britain's foremost entertainers (a position he would maintain until the 1960s) and his shows brought welcome relief during the darkest days of the war.\nEaling Studios signed him up to films during the war. His most famous was the comedy \"Sailors Three\" in which he, Claude Hulbert and Michael Wilding capture a German pocket battleship.\n\nHe also took straight acting parts in \"The Foreman Went to France\", \"The Bells Go Down\" (a tribute to the work done by firemen in London during the Blitz); and \"Bitter Springs\" about a family fighting to make a new life in the Australian Outback.\n\nHe is believed to have originated \"Trinder's Impossibility\" – a \"bar bet\" where the mark is presented with a ten shilling note, partly torn through in two places at right angles to the long side and challenged to hold the two corners of the torn edge and tear it into three pieces. It cannot be done.\n\nAfter the war, as a national figure he was soon recruited to television. From 1955 to 1958, he was the original compere for ITV television programme \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\".\n\n\"He would begin his act with, 'The name's Trinder. That's T-R-I-N-D-E-R, pronounced Chumley.' This witticism was a gentle dig at the snobs of society, who insisted on pronouncing ordinary names in a fancy way which was utterly un-phonetic.\"\n\nHe lived in an Art Deco-style apartment block – Du Cane Court, in Balham, south-west London – the largest such under one roof in Europe in the 1930s. He moved in with Violet Trinder (\"née\" Bailey; they had married in 1932) in 1939, and was still there in 1955. A neighbour described an impromptu encounter she had with him in which her silk scarf had covered her features. He said: \"One should never hide a pretty face.\" His second marriage was to Gwyn (Toni) Lancelyn Green. He moved to a large private estate, Burwood Park in Hersham, Surrey, calling the house \"Tiverly\". He is buried in Burval Cemetery, which is close by to where he lived.\n\nHe hosted his own television series, \"Trinder Box\" on the BBC in 1959. He was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in May 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\nHe was a lifelong devoted supporter of Fulham Football Club and was chairman of the club between 1959 and 1976.\n\nHe was a proud and active member of the exclusive entertainment fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats, serving two non-consecutive terms as its \"King Rat\" in 1963 and 1965, respectively. He was also President of the Lord's Taverners cricketing charity in 1956.\n\nIn 1979 he appeared in an edition of \"The Old Boy Network\", doing his stand-up routine and presenting a condensed history of his life and career.\n\nUsing a wheelchair after a stroke in 1986, he made his final television appearance in \"I Like The Girls Who Do\" recalling his contemporary Max Miller.\n\nAlways a favourite with the Royal family (he made six appearances in Royal Variety Performances between 1945 and 1980), he was appointed a CBE in 1975. He died on 10 July 1989.\n\nA biography by Patrick Newley, \"You Lucky People! – The Tommy Trinder Story\", was published in 2008 (Third Age Press).\n\n\n2. Lew Grade Biography (1906–1998) – Jump Up.

Its objective was to enable corporate raiders to launch leveraged buyout (LBO) offers without the debt component of their financing package fully in place.\n\nThe letter was first crafted in 1983 for use in Carl Icahn's attempt to take ownership of Phillips 66. The conventional wisdom was that due to Icahn's reputation as a takeover artist combined with the junk bond's perception as below investment grade paper, no bank would want to commit the cash necessary to augment any bonds Drexel would raise. Leon Black, Drexel's lead investment banker on the deal, proposed that Drexel write a letter advising the banks that it was \"highly confident\" that it would be able to raise the required debt in time to fulfill Icahn's obligations. A large portion of the debt financing would be composed of junk bonds raised by Milken. In essence, Drexel, as principal underwriter of the debt, wouldn't actually raise the money, but promised that it would raise it. \n\nThe highly confident letter had no legal status. Nonetheless, Drexel, or more precisely, Milken, had a reputation for being able to make markets for any bonds it sold. Thus, its ability to raise the huge amounts of leverage that were required for LBOs was widely accepted as given in the markets during those days. Drexel's senior management saw this as a win-win situation for the firm. If it worked, it would be a valuable tool in future deals; if it didn't, Drexel wouldn't suffer any significant losses. As it turned out, Icahn didn't actually win control of Phillips, but made enough of a profit that the deal was considered an unqualified success for Drexel. The highly confident letter was used on several more occasions over the years, and given Drexel's reputation it was considered as good as cash for corporate raiders in the 1980s.\n\n"}

He was born in Dronfield, Derbyshire.\n\nHendy-Freegard met his victims on social occasions or as customers in the pub or car dealership where he was working. He would reveal his \"role\" as an undercover agent for MI5, Special Branch or Scotland Yard working against the IRA. He would win them over, ask for money and make them do his bidding. He demanded that they cut off contact with family and friends, go through \"loyalty tests\" and live alone in poor conditions. He seduced five women, claiming that he wanted to marry them. Initially some of the victims refused to cooperate with the police because he had warned them that police would be double agents or MI5 agents performing another \"loyalty test\".\n\nA television documentary called \"The Spy who stole my Life\" was shown by Channel Five on 7 September 2005. In Australia, this was called \"The spy who conned me\".\n\nIn 1992 Robert Freegard was working in \"The Swan\", a pub in Newport, Shropshire and befriended two women and one man, three agriculture students of the Harper Adams Agricultural College in Edgmond.\n\nFirst, he told the man that he was an MI5 undercover agent who was investigating an IRA cell in the college. He forced the man to let himself be beaten up to prove his loyalty and to show that he was “hard enough”. He also convinced him to behave in a bizarre manner in college to prove his loyalty and to alienate him from friends. Then Hendy-Freegard told him his cover was blown and both of them had to go undercover. He told the women that the man had cancer and convinced them to accompany them in a “farewell tour” all over England.\n\nLater he let them in on “the story”. He told them to sever all contact with their families because they were in danger just through being associated with him. They moved to Sheffield and gave him all their money. The three spent five months in a Sheffield flat because Hendy-Freegard had forbidden them to go out.\n\nThe group eventually split up, others took jobs — still handing most of their money to Hendy-Freegard — and one of the women became his lover. She gave birth to his two daughters. When she eventually found out about his other affairs and confronted him, he beat her up and threatened to kill her before he told her that she could not talk to anyone for “security reasons”.\n\nHendy-Freegard convinced the man and his parents to give him £300,000. He was put into “training”, performing spurious jobs. Sometimes he would have to wait for days in a certain place for a non-existent meeting. Eventually, he told his sister that the IRA was pursuing him, and the tale began to unravel.\n\nHendy-Freegard had an on/off affair with a recently married PA Elisabeth Bartholomew nee Richardson. She became obsessed with Hendy-Freegard and testified at trial \"that she would have gone anywhere to be with Robert as he was great in bed\". Richardson is one of two daughters originally from the Kiveton Park district of Sheffield. She was estranged from her Mother prior to meeting Hendy- Freegard and her Father is of Polish descent. Richardson also testified that Hendy-Freegard never actually told her he was undercover or MI5 though she believed he was through what other people had told her. Richardson told her closest friend Karen Adams that she wanted to follow Hendy-Freegard to London in a bid to start a new life with him. He told her to take up loans, supposedly to settle her debts following her divorce. Richardson returned to Sheffield and now lives in the Walkley district with her children under a new identity. She is said to have rebuilt her life and moved on from Hendy-Freegard.\n\nIn 2000 Hendy-Freegard met a lawyer, a customer in the car dealership in Chiswick, West London. He helped her to change her car, pocketed the difference, asked for more, persuaded her to give more money for a leasing business they would run together and stole £14,000 from her building society account. They became lovers and went on holidays all over the world. They then became engaged but her family intervened. When the leasing car did not materialize, he told her that the Polish Mafia had taken it.\n\nIn 2002 Hendy-Freegard seduced an American child psychologist with tales of how he had infiltrated a criminal network and how he had killed a criminal who had threatened to expose him. He said he wanted to marry her, on condition that she would also become an agent and cut off the contact with her family. He instigated loyalty tests and a change of identity.\n\nHendy-Freegard convinced a Sheffield jeweller to give the mother of his children a room for a time and later tried to recruit him into the \"organization\". Hendy-Freegard also sent him to perform spurious missions as \"training\" - like sending him to London with strict instructions of what transportation to use, to buy a can opener in a certain shop and hand it over to a certain man in a certain pub. When the victim's \"controller\" seemed excessively amused when told about his trip, he grew suspicious and demanded to see his boss. There was no one in the meeting.\n\nHendy-Freegard convinced a female company director that he was watching someone in the Sheffield car dealership where he was working and convinced her to buy a better car. He sold her original car on his own account, kept the money and convinced her to take a £15,000 loan for him. He also again asked for a room for the mother of his children because she was supposedly in a witness protection program and told her that she was Spanish, so that the two women would not speak to each other.\n\nHendy-Freegard told a woman in Newcastle that he needed money to buy off IRA killers, who had been released after the Good Friday agreement. She gave him £16,000 over six years. He also sold her car and again kept the money.\n\nIn 2002 Scotland Yard and the FBI organized a sting operation. First, the FBI bugged the phone of the American psychologist's parents. Her mother told Hendy-Freegard she would hand over £10,000 but only in person. Hendy-Freegard met the mother in Heathrow airport where police apprehended him. He denied all charges and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against him and continued this story in the subsequent trial.\n\nOn 23 June 2005, after an eight-month trial, Blackfriars Crown Court convicted Robert Hendy-Freegard for two counts of kidnapping, 10 of theft and 8 of deception. On 6 September 2005 he was given a life sentence. \n\nOn 25 April 2007, the BBC reported that Robert Hendy-Freegard had appealed against his kidnapping convictions and won. His life sentence was revoked but still served nine years for the other offences.\n\nThe Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) judgment played an important role in defining the modern offence of kidnap.\n\n"}
{"id": "2142431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142431", "title": "Max Bauer", "text": "Max Bauer\n\nColonel Max Hermann Bauer (31 January 1869 – 6 May 1929) was a German General Staff officer and artillery expert in the First World War. As a protege of Erich Ludendorff he was placed in charge of the German Army's munition supply by the latter in 1916. In this role he played a leading role in the Hindenburg Programme and the High Command's political machinations. Later Bauer was a military and industrial adviser to the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nBauer was born in Quedlinburg. He began to study medicine in Berlin, but then enlisted as an officer candidate in Foot Artillery Regiment 2 (heavy artillery) in 1888. The following year he attended the Kriegs-Schule in Hanover and then was commissioned. After regimental service, in 1898 he was appointed Adjutant to the Artillerie-Prüfungskommission (Artillery Testing Commission). In 1902 he took command of a battery as a captain. An observer of the Russo-Japanese war (1904-5), he was impressed by how Japanese 28 cm mortars demolished Russian forts. When he returned in 1905 he joined the fortress section of the General Staff as their artillery expert, which made him conversant with the leaders of German industry, science, and engineering. Unable to obtain authorization to develop a new heavy mortar, he ordered one from Krupp nonetheless. When the War Ministry learned that a prototype was completed they wanted Bauer dismissed, but the firing tests were so impressive that further development was authorized in 1911. Meanwhile, in 1908 he moved into the mobilization section of the Staff directed by Erich Ludendorff — they became staunch friends. Ludendorff regarded him as the “smartest officer in the army”. In the following year Bauer was appointed as a General Staff Officer, remarkable because he had not had the customary specialized schooling. Helped by his contacts in industry, he studied how the German economy would function during a European war.\n\nWhen the war came Major Bauer was posted to the Operations Section of Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, Supreme Army Command) as head of Section II, which was responsible for heavy artillery, mortars, and fortresses. Earlier in 1914, the first of the Krupp 42cm mortars, nicknamed \"Big Bertha\", and its concrete-piercing shells were ready. They smashed the forts in Belgium and northern France. In 1915 the huge guns forced the surrender of the formidable Russian fortifications in Poland, like Przemyśl, before dealing with the Serbian strongholds at Belgrade. For developing the mortars Bauer was awarded the \"Pour le Mérite\" and an honorary doctorate from the University of Berlin. (In 1918 he received the Oak Leaves for his \"Pour le Mérite.\" During the war he was awarded 25 German and foreign medals.)\nBefore the war he had worked with the chemist Fritz Haber to transform nitrogen from the air into explosive precursors, which let the Germans make war despite the Naval blockade of Germany preventing continued imports of supplies of nitrates that had come from Chile before the war. When the adversaries deadlocked in their trenches along the Western Front, Haber suggested that they could break through by releasing a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas, which is heavier than air. Bauer provided funds and scientists already in the army. Bauer, Haber and Duisberg, the head of the chemical cartel, and their horses were poisoned at the first field test; all were invalided for days. He was present at the first attack, which cleared the defenders out of miles of trenches defending the city of Ypres, but was \"heartbroken\" because Supreme Commander Erich von Falkenhayn had mounted only a diversionary attack, divulging their top-secret for almost no gain. Bauer continued to support the development of new gases, tactics to use them effectively despite protective masks, and Haber's mobilization of scientists for the war effort.\n\nSection II of OHL Supreme Army Command carefully evaluated how their weapons performed on active service. For instance, in 1916 they produced a modified field gun that could be elevated to 40 degrees, compared to its former 16 degrees, and their light howitzer's range was increased 43 percent to . They formed a unit to develop assault tactics using storm troopers. Their first tank, introduced in May 1917, was too large and unwieldy, few were produced, so they had to use captured enemy tanks. Krupp and Daimler designed a light tank, but production was not authorized until French light tanks showed their value, consequently they could not be available until April 1919.\n\nBauer strongly opposed Falkenhayn's plan to attack Verdun in 1916 along a narrow front on the right bank of the Meuse, because their flank would be vulnerable to French artillery on the left bankhe was spot-on; before long they had to attack the left bank as well. While arranging artillery support before the attack he stayed at Fifth Army headquarters where he became a fast friend of its commander, Crown Prince Wilhelm; they kept in touch thereafter. In the first salvo of the attack a 42 cm shell struck Fort Douaumont, a key to the defense. It did not penetrate the reinforced concrete and sand layers: the Verdun forts were stouter than any the mortars had fired on hitherto. Later that year Bauer was dismayed by Falkenhayn's insistence along the Somme front on packing infantry into the foremost trenches to repel the attacks, where they were chewed-up by the Entente's artillery preparations. Bauer decided that Falkenhayn must be replaced by his friend Ludendorff, who had displayed virtuosity on the Eastern Front. Supported by junior officers at OHL he tirelessly lobbied the highest echelons of the army and government against his superior, with criticisms of Falkenhayn like \"...his decisions were half measures and he wavered even over these.\" Falkenhayn was replaced on 29 August 1916 by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of Staff with First Quartermaster General Ludendorff as his associate. To Bauer this was his greatest victory.\n\nThe new commanders resolved to wage total war. OHL Supreme Army Command was reorganized, Bauer's Section II was responsible for heavy artillery, mortars and fortresses. Bauer set highly optimistic goals for weapon production, for instance tripling machine gun output, in what became known as the Hindenburg Program. His industrialist friends welcomed the orders but needed more workers. Skilled men were released from the armed forces and a bill making most men and women subject to national service was proposed to the Reichstag, which rejected the most extreme measures, like shutting the universities except for their medical schools. Compelling women to work was unnecessary, because already more were looking than there were jobs. The bill that finally passed was almost useless. Soon Bauer had a staff officer for propaganda and another stationed in Berlin for political liaison. Despite their exertions, \"Unable to control labour and unwilling to control industry, the army failed miserably...\"\n\nLieutenant General von Höhn's draft of a manual describing defense in depth was rewritten by Bauer and Captain Geyer. The crux was that any attackers who penetrated a lightly manned front line would be destroyed by counterattacks. Defense in depth became German Army doctrine through the Second World War.\n\nOHL relied on his political judgment. Ludendorff and Bauer saw eye to eye: to them \"To govern means to dominate.\" So of course they despised Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg who tried to govern by consensus and hoped to negotiate a peace. They lobbied fervently against him. Bethmann was pressured into agreeing to unrestricted submarine warfare, which brought the United States into the war. On 10 June 1917 Bauer gave Matthias Erzberger, a leading catholic Reichstag deputy, a private, pessimist briefing, including his assessment that the U-boats could not win the war. Bauer had misfired. Instead of backing the struggle with a stiffer spine, Erzberger tabled a resolution for a negotiated peace without annexations. \"OHL\" fought back fiercely. The Crown Prince visited Berlin to pressure legislators. Bauer stayed in the capital, in the thick of the fight. Hindenburg and Ludendorff came there to threaten to resign. The Kaiser told them \"there could be no justification for their presence in Berlin.\" They retreated to Headquarters to tweak their tactics. On 11 July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff telegraphed their resignations unless Bethmann Hollweg was replaced and immediately released the telegrams to the press. Bethmann Hollweg resigned. The resolution was amended to call for \"a peace of equilibrium\" and passed by 212 to 126. It was ignored by the new Chancellor Georg Michaelis. OHL Supreme Army Command was in the political driver's seat, but their only objective was total victory.\n\nBauer worked with Krupp on the development of antiaircraft artillery and of the Paris guns that fired shells but failed to dent civilian morale.\n\nIn 1918 OHL unleashed a series of massive attacks to bring victory. Each attack began with a multi-million shell hurricane artillery bombardment. Bauer assembled the guns that were commanded by Colonel Bruchmüller. Repeatedly they broke through British and French lines. After four successful months an attack on the French along the Marne River was bloodily repulsed and then on 17 July 1918 the right flank of their salient pointing towards Paris was crushed by a powerful, joint French and American attack led by massed tanks. Bauer realized that the war was lost and that \"in decency” it should be ended. He notified his industrialist friends. Bauer and the Crown Prince agreed that Germany needed a dictator, their choice was Ludendorff. Their misreading of the nation's political situation was exposed when Ludendorff was dismissed on 25 October so despised that for safety he fled the country. Vice-Chancellor Friedrich von Payer, the only member of the administration also in the \"Reichstag\", excoriated Bauer for his un-military political meddling. Bauer took this dressing-down as a tribute to his invaluable work; but he retired from active service on 31 October 1918, a few months after being promoted to Colonel. A close student of the war described Bauer: \"There is a strange mixture of force and weakness, calculation and abandon, intelligence and illogic in this man.\"\n\nHe wrote about his experiences and national policy during the war. In 1920 Bauer and Ludendorff were among the leaders of the right-wing Kapp Putsch, which seized control of the government. They were forced out by a nationwide general strike. Ludendorff was let off but Bauer had to flee the country. He worked as a military consultant in the Soviet Union, Spain and Argentina. He returned to Germany in 1925 following an amnesty for all those involved in the Putsch.\n\nIn 1926, Chinese engineer Chu Chia-hua, president of the Sun Yat-Sen University in Canton, contacted Bauer for advice on military and business opportunities in China. In 1927, Bauer visited Chiang Kai-shek, who hired him as a military adviser, wishing to use his contacts to acquire more weapons and industrial assistance from Germany.\n\nIn 1928, Bauer returned to Germany to make contacts with German industries and the army. However, the Treaty of Versailles restricted arms production. In addition, he was \"persona non grata\" to the German government as he had participated in the Kapp Putsch. Nonetheless Bauer was able to establish a China trade department and to make contact with the secret German military mission in Nanking.\n\nWhen Bauer returned to China, he advocated formation of a small core army supported by many local militia forces. Chiang did not use these ideas, since the militias would have concentrated military power in local hands. However, Bauer did manage to have the Whampoa Military Academy moved from Canton to Nanking, it became the Central Military Academy, and to staff it with German military advisers and instructors. He invited 20 German officers to China to work as instructors in military training and military intelligence. Officially, Bauer was Chiang's economic adviser and encouraged him to develop infrastructure.\n\nMax Bauer died in Shanghai, of smallpox, on 6 May 1929, perhaps as a result of having been intentionally infected by one of his Chinese enemies, as he was the only person infected with the contagious disease in the region where he contracted it. He was buried in China with military honors. His ashes were later returned to Germany and buried at Swinemünde on 5 August 1929.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2142452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142452", "title": "Affair of the Poisons", "text": "Affair of the Poisons\n\nThe Affair of the Poisons (\"L'affaire des poisons\") was a major murder scandal in France during the reign of King Louis XIV. Between 1677 and 1682, a number of prominent members of the aristocracy were implicated and sentenced on charges of poisoning and witchcraft. The scandal reached into the inner circle of the king. It led to the execution of 36 people.\n\nThe case began in 1675 after the trial of Madame de Brinvilliers, who was accused of having conspired with her lover, army captain Godin de Sainte-Croix, to poison her father Antonine Dreux d'Aubray in 1666 and two of her brothers, Antoine d'Aubray and François d'Aubray, in 1670, in order to inherit their estates. There were also rumours that she had poisoned poor people during her visits in hospitals. \n\nAfter being accused she fled, but was arrested in Liège. Madame de Brinvilliers was tortured and confessed, was sentenced to death, and on 17 July was tortured with the water cure (forced to drink sixteen pints of water), beheaded, and her body burned at the stake. Her alleged accomplice Sainte-Croix did not face charges because he had died of natural causes in 1672.\n\nThe sensational trial drew attention to a number of other mysterious deaths, starting a number of rumours. Prominent people, including Louis XIV, became alarmed that they might be poisoned.\n\nThe affair proper opened in February 1677 after the arrest of Magdelaine de La Grange on charges of forgery and murder. La Grange appealed to François Michel Le Tellier, Marquis of Louvois, claiming that she had information about other crimes of high importance. Louvois reported to the king, who told Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, who, among other things, was the chief of the Paris police, to root out the poisoners. La Reynie sought to calm the king. The subsequent investigation of potential poisoners led to accusations of witchcraft, murder and more.\n\nAuthorities rounded up a number of fortune tellers and alchemists who were suspected of selling not only divinations, séances and aphrodisiacs, but also \"inheritance powders\" (a euphemism for poison). Some of them confessed under torture and gave authorities lists of their clients, who had allegedly bought poison to get rid of their spouses or rivals in the royal court.\n\nThe most famous case was that of the midwife Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin or \"La Voisin\", who was arrested in 1679 after she was incriminated by the poisoner Marie Bosse. La Voisin implicated a number of important individuals in the French court. These included Olympia Mancini, the Countess of Soissons, her sister the Duchess of Bouillon, François Henri de Montmorency, Duke of Luxembourg and, most importantly, the king's mistress, Madame de Montespan. \n\nQuestioned while intoxicated, La Voisin claimed that Montespan had bought aphrodisiacs and performed black masses with her in order to gain and keep the king's favour over rival lovers. She had worked with a priest named Étienne Guibourg. There was no evidence beyond her confessions, but bad reputations followed these people afterwards. Eleanor Herman, in her book \"Sex with Kings\", claims that the police, given reports of \"babies' bones\", uncovered the remains of 2,500 infants in La Voisin's garden. However, Anne Somerset disputes this in her book \"The Affair of the Poisons\" and states there is no mention of the garden being searched for human remains.\n\nAlso involved in the scandal was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye, the eldest living scion of a prominent noble family. Cavoye was disinherited by his family when, in an act of debauchery, he chose to celebrate Good Friday with a black mass. Upon his disinheritance, he opened a lucrative trade in \"inheritance powders\" and aphrodisiacs. He mysteriously disappeared after the abrupt ending of Louis's official investigation in 1678. Because of this and his name, he was once suspected of being the Man in the Iron Mask. However, this theory has fallen out of favour because it is now known that he was imprisoned by his family in 1679 in the Prison Saint-Lazare.\n\nLa Voisin was sentenced to death for witchcraft and poisoning, and burned at the stake on 22 February 1680. Marshal Montmorency-Bouteville was briefly jailed in 1680, but was later released and became a captain of the guard. Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert helped to hush things up.\n\nDe La Reynie re-established the special court, the \"Chambre Ardente\" (\"burning court\"), to judge cases of poisoning and witchcraft. It investigated a number of cases, including many connected to nobles and courtiers in the king's court. Over the years, the court sentenced 34 people to death for poisoning or witchcraft. Two died under torture and several courtiers were exiled. The court was abolished in 1682, because the king could not risk the publicity of such scandal. To this, Police Chief Reynie said \"the enormity of their crimes proved their safeguard.\"\n\nPerhaps the most important effect of the scandal and subsequent persecutions was the expulsion from France of the Countess of Soissons. Her son remained in France, only to find that his mother's high-profile disgrace prevented him from realising his personal ambitions, as he was effectively barred from pursuing a military career. He would eventually leave France, nurturing a profound grudge against Louis XIV, and enter the service of France's sworn enemies the Habsburgs. Prince Eugene of Savoy, or Prinz Eugen, would, in time, come to be known as one of the greatest generals of the age and one of the factors behind the failure of Louis's bid for hegemony in Europe.\n\nThe Poison Affair implicated 442 suspects: 367 orders of arrests were issued, of which 218 were carried out. Of the condemned, 36 were executed; five were sentenced to the galleys; and 23 to exile. This excludes those who died in custody by torture or suicide. Additionally, many accused were never brought to trial, but placed outside of the justice system and imprisoned for life by a \"lettre de cachet\". \n\nOf the people who were condemned to perpetual imprisonment by \"lettre de cachet\", six women were imprisoned at Château de Villefranche; 18 men at Château de Salces; 12 women at Belle-Île-en-Mer; ten men at Château de Besançon; 14 women at St Andre de Salins; and five women at Fort de Bains.\n\nThis lists people involved in the Poison Affair by being professionally involved in criminal activity. Their punishment is mentioned after their name and role.\nThis lists people involved in the Poison Affair by being clients of the professionals above. Their punishment is mentioned after their name and role.\nIn October 1702 Marie-Anne de La Ville was arrested for having created a new organisation similar to the one of la Voisin, but because of Affair of the Poisons, she and her colleagues were never brought to trial, but imprisoned without trial on a lettre de cachet.\n\nThe organisation of La Voisin and the Affair of the Poisons is portrayed in a novel by Judith Merkle Riley: \"The Oracle Glass\" (1994).\n\nThe Affair of the Poisons is the leading thread throughout the second season of the French-Canadian TV series \"Versailles\". The series shows the courtiers being intoxicated with the powders and potions; even Madame de Montespan is portrayed as having a major role in the poisonings. In the fictionalization, La Voisin was altered to the character Agathe.\n\n"}
{"id": "2142453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142453", "title": "Isidore Isou", "text": "Isidore Isou\n\nIsidore Isou (; 29 January 1925 – 28 July 2007), born Isidor Goldstein, was a Romanian-born French poet, dramaturge, novelist, film director, economist, and visual artist who lived in the 20th century. He was the founder of Lettrism, an art and literary movement which owed inspiration to Dada and Surrealism.\n\nAn important figure in the mid-20th Century avant-garde, he is remembered in the cinema world chiefly for his revolutionary 1951 film \"Traité de Bave et d'Eternité,\" while his political writings are seen as foreshadowing the May 1968 movements.\n\nIsidor Goldstein was born in 1925 to a prominent Jewish family in Botoşani. Despite his wealthy upbringing (his father was a successful entrepreneur and serial restaurateur), he left school at age 15, reading extensively at home and doing odd jobs.\n\nIn 1944 he began his literary career as an avant-garde art journalist during World War II, shortly after the 23 August coup that saw Romania joining the Allies. With the future social psychologist Serge Moscovici, he founded the magazine \"Da\", which was soon after closed down by the authorities. Soon after he became interested in the Zionist cause and collaborated with A.L. Zissu on the Zionist publication ”Mântuirea”.\n\nAfter several attempts to obtain a French visa earlier during the war, he left Romania clandestinely in August 1945, carrying a suitcase full of early manuscripts. He initially traveled to Italy, where fellow experimental poet Giuseppe Ungaretti gave him a letter of introduction and recommendation under the pseudonym \"Isidore Isou\" to French writer Jean Paulhan, which made his entry into the literary world of the newly-liberated Paris much easier.\n\nIntending a total artistic renewal starting from the most basic elements of writing and visual communication, Isidore Isou, assisted by Gabriel Pommerand, organized the first Lettriste manifestation in Paris, on 8 January 1946. During the premiere of dadaist and fellow Romanian Tristan Tzara's play \"La Fuit\" at the Theatre du Vieux-Colombier, Isou shouted \"Dada is dead! Lettrism has taken its place!\"\n\nThrough this and other similar stunts – as well as with the help of Jean Paulhan and Raymond Queneau, who placed his work in \"La Nouvelle Revue\" in April, 1947 – he came to the attention of Gaston Gallimard, who then accepted his memoire \"L'Agrégation d'un Nom et d'un Messie\" for publication.\n\nIn 1949, the young Isou published the novel \"Isou ou la mécanique des femmes\" (\"Isou, or the Mechanics of Women)\", inspired by his obsessions with the 16-year-old muse and later conceptual artist Rhea Sue Sanders. This book was banned by the authorities on 9 May 1950 and Isou was briefly imprisoned and sentenced to prison for eight months (his sentence was suspended); a fine of 2000 francs was imposed along with the destruction of all copies of a book which 1950s' French jurisprudence considered completely obscene. The same year, he also published the first of his works on political theory: \"Traité d'économie nucléaire: Le soulèvement de la jeunesse\" (\"Treatise of Nuclear Economics: Youth Uprising\").\n\nLettrism continued to grow as a movement, becoming less dependent on the work of Isou himself. Maurice Lemaître, Jean-Louis Brau, Gil J. Wolman and Serge Berna joined the group in 1950, with Guy Debord joining in early 1951, after meeting the Lettrists at the 4th Cannes Film Festival. Debord quickly became an important figure in the so-called left wing of the Lettrists, which were more politically active and overtly \"dedicated to Marxist teachings and the critique of capitalist societies\".\n\nIn October 1952, while Charlie Chaplin was on an extensive publicity tour for his film \"Limelight\", the Lettrist left wing, led by Debord, disrupted a press conference at the Hôtel Ritz Paris and distributed a pamphlet called “Finis les pieds plats” (“No More Flat Feet!”) through which they espoused their belief that \"the most urgent expression of freedom is the destruction of idols, especially when they present themselves in the name of freedom\", claimed that the \"leaflet was an attack against a unanimous, servile enthusiasm\" and that Chaplin was an \"emotional blackmailer, master-singer of misfortune\".\n\nIsou was an admirer of Chaplin's films and he considered the cinema legend to be undeserving of this attack. The conflict that arose within the Lettrists because of this notorious incident led to Debord and his group becoming the first splinter group that separated from the Lettrists, forming the Letterist International. Five years later, they would join others to form the Situationist International, an artistic and political organization that would go on to become more famous and influential than any of its predecessors by playing a major role in the events of May 1968.\n\nIn 1951, Isou released his first movie, the experimental film \"Traité de bave et d'éternité\" (\"Treatise on Venom And Eternity\"), whose premiere took place at the Cannes Film Festival. Although the film was not officially entered in the festival, it was widely publicized in the press and its screening constituted one of the festival's fringe events. While threatening to form his own jury to judge the film, Isou went door to door, harassing the administrators of the festival until they agreed to grant him a small, peripheral exhibition. The film consisted of \"four and a half hours [...] of 'discordant' images, enhanced with scratches, shaky footage running upside down or in reverse, blank frames, stock shots and a soundtrack consisting of monologues and onomatopoeic poetry\". In addition, the celluloid on which the film was recorded was attacked with destructive techniques such as scratches and bleaching.\n\nIn one of the film's voiceovers, Isou states his opinion on the medium:\"I believe firstly that the cinema is too rich. It is obese. It has reached its limits, its maximum. With the first movement of widening which it will outline, the cinema will burst! Under the blow of a congestion, this greased pig will tear into a thousand pieces. I announce the destruction of the cinema, the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, of rupture, of this corpulent and bloated organization which calls itself film.\" Following its screening, the work was deemed revolting by many critics present at the premiere. The film was booed and hissed from the start, but after the first section was completed and the screen went completely blank with the audio still going, the audience was furious and the screening had to be stopped. It was, nonetheless, celebrated by Cannes jury member Jean Cocteau, who called it “the most beautiful scandal of the entire festival” and handed Isou a hastily concocted “Prix de spectateurs d’avant-garde”.\n\nIncluding a reflexive discourse on the making of a new cinema, Isou's film became a virtual \"Lettriste\" manifesto. Following the scandal after the film's showing at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival, it was later imported into the United States, where it influenced avant-garde film makers such as Stan Brakhage, who corresponded with Isou directly afterward and let it change his approach to the medium and to narrative entirely.\n\nIn the early 1950s, one segment of Orson Welles' film journal, which was entitled \"Le Letrrisme est la Poesie en Vogue\", included an interview with Isou and Maurice Lemaître.\n\nIn the 1980s, Isidore Isou was accorded French citizenship. His final public appearance was at the University of Paris on 21 October 2000, aged 75. He is buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.\n\nIn the 1960s Lettrist, Lettrist-influenced works and Isidore Isou gained a certain amount of respect in France. Former co-agitators of Isou, writer Guy Debord and artist Gil J. Wolman broke away in 1952 to form the Lettrist International. It later merged with the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, and the London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International, a dissident revolutionary group. In this new form, using means acquired over the course of a decade prior, Lettrist art exerted a profound influence upon the posters, barricades, even designs for clothing in the attempted revolution of 1968. Isou would go on to claim that his 1950 manifesto \"Youth Uprising: First Manifesto\" was a catalyst for the events of the 1968.\n\nMembers of his Lettrist group are still active, among them cineast and writer Roland Sabatier and film director Frédérique Devaux.\n\nMany of Isou's works, and those of the other Lettrists, have recently been reprinted in new editions, together with much hitherto unpublished material, most notably Isou's extensive (1,390 pages) \"La Créatique ou la Novatique (1941-1976)\".\n\nIn July 2007, Kino International released the DVD collection \"Avant-Garde 2: Experimental Films 1928-1954\", which included Isou's film \"Traité de Bave et d'Èternité\" (\"Venom and Eternity\") (1951).\n\nHis daughter, Catherine Goldstein, is a mathematician based in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Little is known for certain about her life; her tumultuous career and flamboyant lifestyle were the subject of gossip, rumor, and colourful stories in her own time, and inspired numerous fictional and semi-fictional portrayals afterwards. Théophile Gautier loosely based the title character, Madeleine de Maupin, of his novel \"Mademoiselle de Maupin\" (1835) on her.\n\nJulie d'Aubigny was born in 1673 to Gaston d'Aubigny, a secretary to Louis de Lorraine-Guise, comte d'Armagnac, the Master of the Horse for King Louis XIV. Her father trained the court pages, and so his daughter learned dancing, reading, drawing, and fencing alongside the pages. In 1687, the Count d'Armagnac had her married to Sieur de Maupin of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and she became Madame de Maupin (or simply \"La Maupin\" per French custom). Soon after the wedding, her husband received an administrative position in the south of France, but the Count kept her in Paris for his own purposes.\n\nAlso around 1687, D'Aubigny became involved with an assistant fencing master named Sérannes. When Lieutenant-General of Police Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie tried to apprehend Sérannes for killing a man in an illegal duel, the pair fled the city to Marseille.\n\nOn the road south, D'Aubigny and Sérannes made a living by giving fencing exhibitions and singing in taverns and at local fairs. While travelling and performing in these impromptu shows, La Maupin dressed in male clothing but did not conceal her sex. On arrival in Marseille, she joined the opera company run by Pierre Gaultier, singing under her maiden name.\n\nD'Aubigny left for Paris and again earned her living by singing. Near Poitiers, she met an old actor named Maréchal who began to teach her until his alcoholism got worse and he sent her on her way to Paris.\n\nThe Paris Opéra hired La Maupin in 1690, having initially refused her. She befriended an elderly singer, Bouvard, and he and Thévenard convinced Jean-Nicolas de Francine, master of the king's household, to accept her into the company. She debuted as Pallas Athena in \"Cadmus et Hermione\" by Jean-Baptiste Lully the same year. She performed regularly with the Opéra, first singing as a soprano, and later in her more natural contralto range. The Marquis de Dangeau wrote in his journal of a performance by La Maupin given at Trianon of Destouches' \"Omphale\" in 1701 that hers was \"the most beautiful voice in the world\".\n\nIn Paris, and later in Brussels, she performed under the name Mademoiselle de Maupin because singers were addressed as \"mademoiselle\" whether or not they were married.\n\nUntil 1705, La Maupin sang in new operas by Pascal Collasse, André Cardinal Destouches, and André Campra. In 1702, André Campra composed the role of Clorinde in \"Tancrède\" specifically for her \"bas-dessus\" (contralto) range. She sang for the court at Versailles on a number of occasions, and again performed in many of the Opéra's major productions. She appeared for the last time in \"La Vénitienne\" by Michel de La Barre (1705).\n\nShe retired from the opera in 1705 and took refuge in a convent, probably in Provence, where she is believed to have died in 1707 at the age of 33. She has no known grave. \n\nThéophile Gautier, when asked to write a story about d'Aubigny, instead produced the novel \"Mademoiselle de Maupin\", published in 1835, taking aspects of the real La Maupin as a starting point, and naming some of the characters after her and her acquaintances. The central character's life was viewed through a romantic lens as \"all for love\". D'Albert and his mistress Rosette are both in love with the androgynous Théodore de Sérannes, whom neither of them knows is really Madeleine de Maupin. A performance of Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\", in which La Maupin, who is passing as Théodore, plays the part of Rosalind playing Ganymede, mirrors the cross-dressing pretense of the heroine. The celebration of sensual love, regardless of gender, was radical, and the book was banned by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and authorities elsewhere.\n\n\nApart from Gautier's \"Mademoiselle de Maupin\", La Maupin has been portrayed many times in print, stage and screen, including:\n\n"}

The northbound opened in 1972 and the southbound in 1993. They are known for their family-run business which eschews the typical facilities at British motorway services for a farm shop and buildings in keeping with the local environment.\n\nThe services are between junctions 38 and 39 on the ascent from the Lune Valley to Shap summit. As the north and southbound carriageways diverge at this point, the two service areas are not actually adjacent to each other but a couple of hundred metres apart.\n\nTebay West Services, which serves the northbound carriageway, opened in 1972, two years after the M6 section between Lancaster and Penrith was completed. The M6 here passes through an environmentally sensitive area, and the services were sited in this location to fit in with the surrounding local area and provide a view away from the motorway. A corresponding southbound services, Killington Lake Services, was constructed at the same time.\n\nTebay East was opened in 1993, serving southbound traffic. Both are operated by an independent family-owned company, Westmorland Motorway Services, rather than a national chain. The same company runs Truckstop Services at junction 38, which opened in 1986 and caters for HGV and long-distance coaches, and Gloucester Services between junctions 11a and 12 of the M5 in Gloucestershire, which was built into the side of a hill and covered with grass to reduce its visual impact.\n\nTebay Services are in open countryside surrounded by trees, small lakes and panoramas of the Cumbrian landscape, and has its own duck pond. Westmorland shun typical motorway service food outlets. Instead, both Tebay outlets have award-winning farm shops, which sell local meat and other food, and insist on using local suppliers. The services have been praised as being the best in the country. In 2003, Westmorland won Best Local Retailer in BBC Radio 4's Food and Farming Awards, and in 2006 they were awarded Best Motorway Services in Britain by \"Which?\". The farm shops, which sell locally sourced produce, were officially opened by Prince Charles in 2004.\n\nIn addition, the northbound service area has a caravan park and a hotel.

{"id": "2142480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142480", "title": "Opal Koboi", "text": "Opal Koboi\n\nOpal Koboi is a fictional character from the \"Artemis Fowl\" series by Eoin Colfer. After the character's introduction in the second book in the series as a supporting antagonist, Colfer again used Koboi as the main antagonist of the fourth, sixth, and eighth books in the series, giving her the status of archenemy to Artemis Fowl II.\n\nColfer first brought the Opal Koboi character into the \"Artemis Fowl\" series through the May 2002 publication of \"Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident\". Koboi was written in this second book of the series as an evil genius responsible for the highest level of planning and execution of a war by goblins using outlawed lethal lasers against the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance (LEPrecon) police squad, shutting off all the LEP's power and blaming her only scientific rival Foaly for the entire affair. She employs Lieutenant Briar Cudgeon, a LEPrecon officer who was disgraced in the prequel, as her partner in her attempt to stage this coup deep in the bowels of the Earth. However, at the climax of the book, Artemis reveals that Cudgeon plans to betray Koboi. Koboi flies into a rage and attacks Cudgeon. In the ensuing struggle, Cudgeon is electrocuted to death by falling into live plasma tubes and Koboi is incapacitated. She then falls into a self-induced coma as part of a plan to escape imprisonment.\n\nWith statements such as \"before her second birthday she had dismantled her first hard drive,\" the Opal Koboi character comes off as precocious, but not in a positive way. Described as an \"insane, power-mad pixie\" and an outrageous character that is confident of her own intelligence in a way that annoys other people, this beauteous \"pixie with the golden touch\" contributes to the Colfer idea that fairies are basically as bad as humans – and fight even dirtier. The name Koboi sounds both as \"cowboy\" and \"kobold\", a temperamental sprite of German folklore who becomes outraged when not fed properly, and who sometimes is referred to as a spirit of caves and mines, which fits since the fairies of the series live underground. In this way, the name Koboi suits the gold-digger Opal Koboi. It is also known that Koboi bankrupted her father's business after he tried to dissuade her from studying engineering (as he expected his daughter to follow the normal path in life for female pixies: namely, marrying a suitable husband) and that she has a long, bitter rivalry with Foaly since their days at university, and that one of Opal's main goals is to prove she is intellectually superior to the centaur. The only reason to this hatred between the two magical creatures is that Foaly won their University's science fair with his iris-cam, which Opal found stupid and to which she thought that her Koboi wings were far superior. She then accuses the centaur of winning only because he was a male.\n\nOpal Koboi returns as the titular antagonist in \"Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception\", which was published in April 2005 as the fourth book of the fictional series, following her absence in \"Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code\". In this installment, Colfer describes Opal Koboi's coma situation from the perspective of Doctor Jerbal Argon, a fictional fairy gnome psychiatrist taking care of his incarcerated, \"celebrity\" patient:\"If only every fairy in the facility was as docile as Opal Koboi. All she needed was a few intravenous tubes and a monitor, which had been more than paid for by her first six months' medical fees. Doctor Argon fervently hoped that little Opal never woke up. Because once she did, the LEP would haul her off to court. And when she had been convicted of treason her assets would be frozen, including the Clinic's fund. No, the longer Opal's nap lasted, the better for everyone, especially her. Because of their thin skulls and large brain volume, Pixies were susceptible to various maladies such as catatonia, amnesia and narcolepsy.\" Rather than being in an actual coma, Colfer has Koboi in a coma-like state of meditation known as a \"cleansing coma\" to elude punishment for her own criminal activities. Koboi awakens herself from the faked coma, leaves a clone of herself under guard in a coma and disguises herself as a human child, and breaks out of prison to take revenge and dominate the world both of fairies and humans. Koboi's plan is to bring the Fairy People in contact with humans, \"who until now have been completely ignorant of their existence below the surface of the earth, but by their nature manage to ruin everything they touch.\" Koboi, who plans to install herself as supreme world ruler, is opposed by both Captain Holly Short, a talkative elf in the LEP, and Artemis Fowl, a 14-year-old criminal mastermind from a super-criminal family dynasty and the main character of the series. Colfer makes their opposition to Opal Koboi more difficult by erasing Fowl's memory of the wicked Opal Koboi and the other fairy people through a Foaly mindwipe and by having Koboi frame Captain Holly Short for a murder that in fact was committed by Koboi. Even though Opal has laid out death traps for Artemis and Holly in a troll-infested amusement park, Holly eventually is able to restore Artemis' memory and the two of them stop Opal. At the end of \"Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception\", Colfer has the reader assuming that Koboi is safely locked up in an LEP prison.\n\nShe also appears in \"Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox\", as the main antagonist again. Artemis and Holly tangle with a past version of Koboi. She had realized that absorbing parts of different (usually rare) animals, she can modify her magic. By now she can levitate, shoot lightning and has a more advanced mesmer. She plans to use the Silky Sifaka Lemur to channel her magic into Time Travel which she will use to become leader. At the climax of the book, she has been revealed to have travelled to the current time, and was defeated but unapprehended. The consequences of her leaving the past has yet to be resolved.\n\nColfer used the fourth novel to describe Opal Koboi's hysterical megalomania in significant detail. Coming across as embittered, slightly loony, deranged and dangerous, ultra-evil, and world domination-obsessed, Colfer has the criminal mastermind Koboi go \"mind-to-mind\" against a similarly intelligent and criminal mastermind Fowl. Strangely, in \"The Time Paradox\", she seemed insane on a level which was not evident in \"The Arctic Incident\" (It is suggested in \"The Last Guardian\" that this is because the timeline that created this Opal has diverged from the timeline that created the 'present' Opal), even deciding to think about choosing to shoot down the moon after using the term in a thought.\n\nIn \"The Atlantis Complex\", Artemis suspects Opal of the attack on Atlantis until he discovers that the enemy is Turnball Root, disgraced brother of the late Commander Julius Root. There is also reference to her present, human self being relocated during an attack on a prison- although she is contained in a metal box to prevent her escaping-, as well as reference to the rumour that her past self is active in the present and may be trying to free her.\n\nIn \"The Last Guardian\", Opal deliberately arranges for the execution of her own past self- although she speculates that the younger her is merely an alternate Opal due to her own lack of memory of these events-, with the resulting energy explosion as everything that Opal Koboi has created and done over the five years between her past and present self is erased causing a social collapse as multiple Koboi technologies are destroyed or cease to exist. However, Opal manages to survive after tricking the LEP into moving her present self into a radiation-proof tube, channelling the energy release as her body becomes a paradox to regrow her entire body. She subsequently releases a group of long-imprisoned warrior spirits to serve as her army while she works to activate a doomsday spell that will wipe all human life from Earth's surface, but Artemis is able to defeat her by using her clone- now 'trained' to perform simple movements- to instead activate a command that will disperse the energy and the spirits while leaving Earth unharmed, the resulting energy release also destroying Opal's powers. She is finally killed by one of her warrior spirits.\n\nKoboi is noted as having an IQ of 300. In \"The Time Paradox\" she is discovered to be illegally harvesting animal brain fluid and body parts and using their potency to augment her magical abilities; she is able to levitate unaided, release concussive energy waves, conjure fireballs (a gift only goblins are mentioned as having), and has acute mind control, much more powerful than the standard mesmer; she is also able to absorb memories, wiping Mulch Diggums' mind clean of all the events of \"The Time Paradox\" in the process; she also seeks out the silky sifaka lemur Jayjay as his brain fluid would allow her to time travel, an ability only the demon warlocks Qwan and No1 are able to use. On top of this, she is able to use remote psychokinesis on such a level that she is able to mimic the complex symptoms of the fairy disease Spelltropy perfectly, fooling even Foaly's sensors into believing Artemis' mother has actually contracted the disease. When she is shot with a tranquilizer dart by Artemis Fowl, she inadvertently conjures several images by projecting them through manipulating magical sparks and marshaling them into recognizable shape, again a power only Qwan and No.1 are noted as having. Finally, she prizes her ability to shoot lightning bolts from her fingertips; however, it requires a lot of magic and great concentration to muster them. It is worth noting, however, that the human pituitary gland she surgically installed has robbed her of all her magical powers, rendering all that time she spent gathering brain fluids to augment her powers useless. She later has the pituitary gland removed, and uses the power caused by the paradox of killing her past self to generate even greater magical power, able to reconstruct the molecular structure of anything around her and fire plasma blasts capable of vaporizing a fairy, but this does not stop her being fatally stabbed by one of her summoned Beserkers.\n"}

It is situated on the edge of Otago Harbour, and is named for pioneer European settler James Macandrew who lived here during his later life. The Te Reo Māori name for the bay, Te Roto Pāteke, refers to the Brown teal (Māori: Pāteke) formerly prevalent in the area. Early European residents of the area called the bay \"The Hundreds\", due to the large number of boulders which covered the foreshore.\n\nMacandrew Bay is a suburb of Dunedin, but has the feel of an isolated coastal settlement and is often regarded as a separate township, even though the heart of the city is visible 10 kilometres away at the head of the harbour. It is both a commuter and a harbourside retreat from the city. Macandrew Bay's 2001 population was 1131.\nThe settlement centres on an area around the junction of Portobello Road and Greenacres Street, the latter a narrow road which rises steeply towards the interior of the Peninsula. Greenacres Street roughly follows the valley of the small Rodgers Creek. The community hall lies on the lower part of Greenacres Street close to its junction with Portobello Road, and the settlement's few shops lie immediately to the southwest of the junction. Behind these shops lie the community's primary school and cemetery, the latter of which includes the grave of James Macandrew.\n\nThe bay has a small beach opposite the shops, which is well-used by the public. The beach was created artificially, with sand brought to the bay from the nearby Pacific coast. The area around the beach has been turned into a small public park, and landscaping of this was completed in 1979.\n\nMacandrew Bay is the largest of several settlements which lie on the harbour coast of Otago Peninsula. Between it and Dunedin lies Glenfalloch, a private gardens open to the public.\n\nBeyond Macandrew Bay to the northeast lie Company Bay and Raynbirds Bay and to the southwest is Colinswood, the latter named for James Macandrew's house. These small settlements could be considered \"suburbs\" of Macandrew Bay. Beyond Raynbirds Bay lie Broad Bay and Portobello. These settlements are connected to each other and to Dunedin's city centre by Portobello Road, a winding road which runs along the harbour coast of the peninsula. Both the road and the sea wall which lies along the harbour edge were constructed by prison labour in the 1860s.\nA second route, Castlewood Road, rises from Company Bay to meet with Highcliff Road, which runs along the ridge of the peninsula from Dunedin to Portobello. Castlewood Road also connects with Camp Road, which lead to the stately home Larnach Castle, situated above Broad Bay.\n"}

The organization currently operates programs in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Croatia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Jordan, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Uganda, Rwanda, the United States and Vietnam.\n\nSurvivor Corps is a leading proponent of the peer support method, in which survivors are linked to one another to share information as well as emotional and practical support, and work together on issues affecting their lives. The Survivor Corps peer support program connects survivors with survivor role models to offer encouragement and motivation. Peer support is used to help new survivors find hope, get jobs, and get on with their lives.\n\nSurvivor Corps also brings conflict survivors together to promote reconciliation and rebuilding through community service projects and local activism.\n\nBy training and organizing survivor advocates to campaign for their rights, survivor corps has brought the voices of survivors into international negotiations, to ban weapons that cause unacceptable harm to civilians and to honor the rights of survivors of war and of persons with disabilities.\n\nIn May 2008, Survivor Corps emerged from Landmine Survivors Network. The name change reflects the expansion of the organization's mission to include all types of survivors of global conflict and war, including United States service members and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSurvivor Corps has long played a leading role the International Campaign to Ban Landmines coalition (ICBL), which has over 1100 member organizations and whose goal is to abolish the production and use of anti-personnel landmines. Survivor Corps co-founders Jerry White and Ken Rutherford helped lead the coalition's efforts that secured the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which in turn earned the coalition the Nobel Peace Prize. Prominent Survivor Corps supporters have included Queen Noor of Jordan and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe Mine Ban Treaty bans the use, stockpiling, production and trade of antipersonnel mines. It was also the first arms control agreement in history to require governments to provide assistance to victims of the weapon. This was achieved by an unprecedented level of participation by survivors in the treaty process.\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entered into force on May 3, 2008, affecting 650 million people with disabilities around the world, including survivors of violent conflict. Survivor Corps helped ensure that this progressive human rights treaty addressed persons with disabilities not as charity cases, but as equal and autonomous citizens entitled to their human rights and full participation in society.\n\nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions was signed in Oslo on December 3, 2008 and entered into force on 1 August 2010. It bans the use, stockpiling, production and trade of cluster bombs due to the indiscriminate harm they cause to civilians. As a leader on the steering committee of the Cluster Munitions Coalition, Survivor Corps used its past experience with the Mine Ban Treaty to help ensure that the Convention on Cluster Munitions included the strongest possible requirements to provide assistance to victims of the weapon, their families and communities.\n\nOver the course of several years, Survivor Corps established the first database designed to track the rehabilitation needs of mine victims and the resources available to help survivors, their families, and the communities affected by anti-personnel mines.\n\nIn 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales visited Bosnia with LSN co-founders Jerry White and Ken Rutherford to meet landmine survivors. Her high-profile tour of the war-torn country brought global media attention and public support to the issue of landmines. After the death of Diana, the organization became the only American-based charity to receive support from the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Also in 1997, Queen Noor of Jordan stepped in to take a prominent role in supporting the organization's work.\n\nIn 1999, along with Queen Noor and key members of the United States Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, the organization drew international attention to the refusal of the United States to sign the Mine Ban Treaty, while appealing to the US to revisit landmine policy.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, LSN provided health support, economic opportunity and human rights advocacy for survivors of landmines around the world.\n\nIn May 2008, Landmine Survivors Network changed its name to Survivor Corps. The name change reflects the expansion of their mission to include all types of survivors of global conflict and war, including United States service members and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Survivor Corps expanded its programs into Israel, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and created additional projects in Colombia.\n\nIn early 2010 Survivor Corps elected to make its country programs in Vietnam, El Salvador and Bosnia into independent NGOs and to transfer its peer support resources to the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery located at James Madison University.\n\nOn September 30, 2010 Survivor Corps closed its headquarters office in Washington DC.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2142492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142492", "title": "Silverton, Devon", "text": "Silverton, Devon\n\nSilverton is a large village and civil parish, about north of Exeter, in the English county of Devon. It is one of the oldest villages in Devon and dates from the first years of the Saxon occupation.\n\nIt has been suggested that the medieval manor of Burn, within the modern parish of Silverton, may be the estate listed as Mylenburnan (Mill-on-the-Burn or Burn Mill) in the will of King Alfred the Great of 899, now in the British Library, in which it was left to his youngest son Athelweard (c. 880-922).\n\nIn the year 2001, its population was 1,905, recounted to 1,494 at the United Kingdom Census 2011. The electoral ward with the same name had a population of 1,875 at the above census. The parish has three pubs: The Lamb, The Ruffwell Inn, and The Silverton Inn. The church, dating back to the fourteenth century, is dedicated to St Mary. It has a full set of bells that are rung regularly. Inside, the pews have doors at the end of each row which is unusual in this area. The village also has a further two churches - an Evangelical and a Methodist church; both are popular with social and youth clubs.\n\nThe village is on the \"old\" road from Exeter to Tiverton and as such was once a busy thriving place. Now it has become a dormitory for people working in Exeter although there are still a number of original families living in the village. A post office, a small supermarket (Spar), butcher's shop and a hairdresser offer most necessities for the residents.\n\nThe main feature of the village is the giant oak tree which is over 1,000 years old.\n\nThe Bristol and Exeter Railway opened Silverton railway station in 1867 but it has since closed.\n\nOn the first Saturday of each August, the village holds a Street Market, which is popular among local people. There are stalls selling local goods and crafts, as well as entertainment and children's activities organised throughout the day, and the tug-of-war always ends the day on a high.\n\nSilverton also has a football club, Silverton FC, who play in the MACRON Devon and Exeter Football League. They play in Red and Navy Blue stripes at Home games and Pink and Black Away. \nThe Silverton football pitch is notoriously slanted lengthways - with it being an estimated seven feet lower at one end. \nThe ‘Silvers’ are sponsored by two very local companies, Keywise Cars Ltd and Exe Valley Brewery.\n\nSilverton is represented on Mid Devon District Council by Liberal Democratic Party Councillor Josh Wright (Village Ward) and by Independent Councillor Bob Deed (North Ward).\n\nSilverton Parish is divided into two wards; Village Ward to the south includes the village of Silverton together with the hamlets of Ellerhayes, Greenslinch, Hayne and Poundsland, and is home to around 95% of the population of the parish. In contrast, North Ward with a population of around 80, is almost entirely rural. Noted Devon historian William Hoskins claimed that Silverton North Ward was the location of Stochelie, a Domesday manor whose location had long been lost. If correct, North Ward would at one time have contained a small manor quite separate from Silverton. Until the 1990s the only settlements comprised a dozen or so working farms. Today most of these have been converted into small groups of dwellings including Underleigh, Dorweek, Ravenshayes and Leigh Barton. Bounded to the west by the small Burn river and to the north by the village of Butterleigh and lying on the slopes of the Hayridge Hills, North Ward affords tranquillity as well as stunning views of the Exe, Burn and Culm valleys.\n\nThe Silverton Parochial Trust is a historic charity still operating in the Silverton area. It comprises a collection of 13 legacies, the earliest dating from 1616 and now formed into a modern charitable trust controlling property, land and investments. It is managed by seven resident trustees. Funds are available for the immediate assistance of parishioners who are in a condition of ‘need, hardship or distress’ which is not provided for by the state schemes such as Social Services or state benefit programmes.\n\nThe parish church, dedicated to St Mary, is a building mainly of the 15th and 16th centuries; it has a nave, chancel and north and south aisles. The west tower has battlements, buttresses and four pinnacles. The north aisle was built with funds left by a rector who died in 1479; a rebus referring to a rector of 1519-49 is on the east respond of the north arcade. A new chancel, vestry and two western bays were added by the architects Hayward and Ashworth in 1860-63.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2142500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142500", "title": "Keitai Denjū Telefang", "text": "Keitai Denjū Telefang\n\nOn April 26, 2002, a lesser-known sequel for the Game Boy Advance called was released exclusively in Japan. Likewise, two versions were released, also called and , featuring similar differences in between them.\n\n\"Keitai Denjū Telefang\" and \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\" revolve around collecting the phone numbers of various creatures, referred to as , on a device called , that the player, classified as a , encounters and must defeat. These are used to be able to request aid from them at a later time, should he or she require it. The games are played from a third-person, top-down perspective, with the player taking the role of the games' young protagonist and main T-Fanger: Shigeki in \"Keitai Denjū Telefang\" and Kyō in \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\".\n\nOne \"Denjū\" stays by the player's side at a time and follows him around but in battle he can call up to two other \"Denjū\" to help him. \"Denjū\" will sometimes give the player their phone numbers after he or she beats them in a random battle but take longer to arrive in battle if they're originally from a distant area, due to getting lost. Sometimes, they may not even show up at all if called, so care must be taken to make sure that the player is not calling a \"Denjū\" which is too far away.\n\nAll \"Denjū\" have a range of statistics (colloquially called \"stats\"): Hit Points (HP), Speed, Attack, Defense, Denma Attack and Denma Defense. These statistics determine how powerful, fast or robust any given \"Denjū\" is. The type of habitat a \"Denjū\" lives in determines how weak it is to attacks from \"Denjū\" from other habitats; there is a vulnerability chain that goes from Mountain to Sky, from Sky to Forest, from Forest to Aquatic, from Aquatic to Desert, from Desert to Grassland and, finally, from Grassland to Mountain. This also applies in reverse in the sense that a \"Denjū\" of certain types inflicts less damage upon one it is weak to. However, this was slightly changed in \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\", where \"Denjū\"'s habitat types are defensive, and attacks are of separate offensive types: Normal, Flame, Thunder, Water, Wind, Rock and Machine. This arrangement makes \"Denjū\" a bit more versatile, as they may carry moves that would be effective against opponents they would normally have trouble against.\n\nIn battle, the \"Denjū\" have an array of two to four attacks specific to their species. The battles are not strictly turn-based; the Speed stat of a \"Denjū\" determines how many turns it can take and when. Thus, for example, a \"Denjū\" with a higher Speed stat could attack twice for every time a \"Denjū\" with a lower Speed stat goes once, also attacking before the slower \"Denjū\" can get a hit in. Battles are performed in matches where each team may have anywhere from one to three \"Denjū\" participating. Losing causes a game over and the player is then returned to the title screen of the games.\n\nA \"Denjū\"'s attacks cannot be altered unless a \"Denjū\" evolves. Evolution is achieved by three different methods: \"Natural evolution\" (achieved by training \"Denjū\"), \"Modified evolution\" (by giving \"Denjū\" certain items in a \"modified evolution\" area) or \"Experimental evolution\" (achieved by taking the DNA of one Denjū with an item called Phone Card and giving it to the \"Denjū\" to be \"experimentally evolved\"). Some \"Denjū\" do not evolve. In \"Keitai Denjū Telefang\", evolution is permanent but in \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\", evolution can be reversed if it was not achieved through \"Natural evolution\".\n\nMany \"Denjū\" have a special attack called Denma attack that needs to be charged up and takes multiple turns to execute. This special attack does damage based on the \"Denjū\"'s Denma Attack stat and is often considered not to be worth the wait. Due to the time that it takes for the special attack to charge, it is easy for the opponent to attack during multiple turns or to avoid the move entirely. In \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\", instead of having to wait for a Denma attack to charge, its use is limited by a DP meter. There are other attacks that can raise the Attack or Defense stat of a \"Denjū\" or heal the user or its allies. These vary from \"Denjū\" to \"Denjū\".\n\nThe use of items varies greatly between \"Keitai Denjū Telefang\" and \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\". In \"Keitai Denjū Telefang\", items are only used for evolving \"Denjū\" or gifts, excluding some items that are important to the storyline such as keys to unlock doors or a plush \"Denjū\" toy that has been stolen. Evolution items are generally objects that come from the human world. These items are capable of affecting \"Denjū\" in certain ways when they are forcibly combined. Such items range from simple objects like pencils and batteries to flamethrowers, computers, cranes and shuriken. \"Denjū\" which evolve via \"Modified evolution\" will only do so if they receive a specific item. Certain items also give large amounts of experience points to \"Denjū\" without evolving them. In \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\", evolution items are of the same type as \"Denjū\" (Mountain, Sky, Forest, Aquatic, Desert or Grassland) and any such item can be used to evolve a \"Denjū\" of the same type. However, different items may have certain effects on stat growth. Evolution items can also be thrown at enemy \"Denjū\" to attempt to befriend them more easily and the probability of this occurring is increased if the item thrown matches their type. In addition to evolution items, there are also special items which can be held by \"Denjū\" to boost one of their stats. \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\" also introduced items which can heal a \"Denjū\"'s HP and/or DP as well as cure status effects such as paralysis. Items can be purchased at shops or found in treasure chests but may also be picked up after battles or found by running through grass.\n\nThe games take place in the year 2020 and there are special mobile phones equipped with a unique antenna called D-Shot which allows teleportation through \"antenna trees\". A 10-year-old boy named Shigeki finds one of these phones and is accidentally transported with another boy, Matsukiyo, to another world when he loses a baseball near an \"antenna tree\".\n\nThis world is full of fantasy creatures called \"Denjū\", who all own a D-Shot and use them to call their friends to help them compete in battles. These phone battles are also known as Telefang. Shigeki becomes a T-Fanger and travels the \"Denjū\" world, trying to learn more about it. At the same time, he gets wrapped up in several plots involving evil \"Denjū\" as well as other humans, who may or may not be T-Fangers.\n\nThe games follow the story of Kyō, a blue-haired 10-year-old T-Fanger who travels to the \"Denjū\" world to look for his missing father. His friend Midori accompanies him on the journey. During his adventure, he encounters a \"Denjū\" named Diablos, who is killing off the \"antenna trees\" as he is not happy with the fact that humans are entering the \"Denjū\" world.\n\nAfter Diablos kills all but one \"antenna tree\", that tree becomes the only gate between the two worlds. Kyō has to prevent Diablos from killing that last \"antenna tree\", or Kyō will be stuck in the \"Denjū\" world forever.\n\n\n\n\n\nA manga series based on the \"Power Version\" was serialized by Kodansha. First released as a monthly feature in the \"Comic BonBon\" magazine, the manga's issues were later reprinted as a set of three tankōbon, or volumes. A manga was also serialized by Kodansha for \"Keitai Denjū Telefang 2\"; however, it was featured only in the \"Comic BonBon\" magazine and was never reprinted.\n\nThe first two \"Keitai Denjū Telefang\" games received an unofficial English translation. The original games were not related to Nintendo's \"Pokémon \" series, but the translations were marketed as \"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pokémon Jade\". The creatures used for the cover arts are neither Denjuu nor Pokémon; the box for \"Pokémon Jade\" depicts the forest spirit, Shishigami, from Hayao Miyazaki's anime film \"Princess Mononoke\", while the box for \"Pokémon Diamond\" depicts a blue snake-like creature of unknown origin. The translations are notorious for their poorly translated English text as well as serious programming errors that can cause the game to crash.\n\n"}

It was celebrated annually, especially at Orchomenus in Boeotia.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, agrionia was celebrated at night with only women accompanied by the priests of Dionysus, who often wore black garments. Women pretended to search for Dionysos and then declared that he has fled to the Muses and hidden there. After that they feasted and begun to present and solve riddles.\n\nAccording to legend, the Minyades or (), the daughters of king Minyas of Orchomenus, who had despised the Dionysian rites, were seized with a desire to eat human flesh of one of their children. They cast lots to decide which of their children they would eat and selected Hippasus, son of Leucippe.\n\nPlutarch also explains that the festival included a human sacrifice. At this festival it was originally the custom for the priest of the god to pursue a woman of the Minyan family with a drawn sword and kill her.

As a child prodigy, he started to perform publicly in Bohemian towns at the age of nine.\nHis father taught him music, encouraged his playing the piano and helped him get a scholarship to attend the University of Prague, where he studied philosophy. He also had lessons in piano and composition from Václav Tomášek. He found it impossible to obtain sufficient work as a musician in Prague, so in 1813 at the age of 22, Voříšek moved to Vienna to study law and, he hoped, to meet Beethoven. In Vienna he was able to greatly improve his piano technique under Johann Nepomuk Hummel, but once more failed to gain full-time employment as a musician.\n\nAlthough Voříšek was enthralled by the classical style of Mozart, he was more intrigued by the incipient romanticism of Beethoven.\n\nIn 1814, as he was starting to compose, he did indeed meet Beethoven in Vienna. He also met other leading musicians there, including the composers Louis Spohr, Ignaz Moscheles, Hummel, and especially Franz Schubert with whom he became fast friends.\n\nHe completed his law studies in 1821 and was appointed barrister to the Court Military Privy Councillor, for whom he mainly drafted legal documents. But in 1822, he at last found musical employment as second court organist and ended his legal career. He was appointed first organist in 1824.\n\nHe soon won esteem as a composer of orchestral, vocal and piano music for orchestra. In 1818 he became conductor of the Friends of Music Society (\"Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde\") of Vienna.\n\nVorišek died, in Vienna, of tuberculosis in 1825 at the age of 34. He was buried at Währing cemetery, where within three years his idol Beethoven (in 1827) and his friend Schubert (in 1828) ended up as well. The cemetery is now a park named after Schubert, although the mortal remains of both Schubert and Beethoven were later moved to the Zentralfriedhof the Central Cemetery of Vienna.\n\nVoříšek wrote only one symphony, his Symphony in D major, in 1821. Its style has been likened to Beethoven's first two symphonies, but its melodically inventive early Romantic idiom was similar to Schubert's.\n\nIn his capacity as imperial court organist, Voříšek composed a Mass in B-flat major. Together with his single symphony, some of his piano works and his Violin Sonata in G major, Op. 5, the Mass has been recorded.\n\nThe first recorded use of impromptu as a musical term occurred in 1817, in the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\", an idea of the publisher to describe a piano piece by Voříšek . His Impromptus Op. 7 were published in 1822, pieces known to his friend Schubert who subsequently used the description for several sets of music for piano, as did Frederic Chopin and numerous other composers.\n\nIn 1823-24, like Schubert, he was one of the 50 composers to contribute a variation on the same waltz by Anton Diabelli for the \"Vaterländischer Künstlerverein\" on which Beethoven composed his 33 variations (Op. 120).\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director-General.\n\nASI was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director-General. The first systematic research into the subcontinent's history was conducted by the Asiatic Society, which was founded by the British Indologist William Jones on 15 January 1784. Based in Calcutta, the society promoted the study of ancient Sanskrit and Persian texts and published an annual journal titled \"Asiatic Researches\". Notable among its early members was Charles Wilkins who published the first English translation of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" in 1785 with the patronage of the then Governor-General of Bengal, Warren Hastings. However, the most important of the society's achievements was the decipherment of the Brahmi script by James Prinsep in 1837. This successful decipherment inaugurated the study of Indian palaeography.\n\nArmed with the knowledge of Brahmi, Alexander Cunningham, a protégé of Prinsep, carried out a detailed survey of the Buddhist monuments which lasted for over half a century. Inspired by early amateur archaeologists like the Italian military officer, Jean-Baptiste Ventura, Cunningham excavated \"stupas\" along the width, the length and breadth of India. While Cunningham funded many of his early excavations himself, in the long run, he realised the need for a permanent body to oversee archaeological excavations and the conservation of Indian monuments and used his stature and influence in India to lobby for an archaeological survey. While his attempt in 1848 did not meet with success, the Archaeological Survey of India was eventually formed in 1861 by a statute passed into law by Lord Canning with Cunningham as the first Archaeological Surveyor. The survey was suspended briefly between 1865 and 1871 due to lack of funds but restored by Lord Lawrence the then Viceroy of India. In 1871, the Survey was revived as a separate department and Cunningham was appointed as its first Director-General.\n\nCunningham retired in 1885 and was succeeded as Director General by James Burgess. Burgess launched a yearly journal \"The Indian Antiquary\" (1872) and an annual epigraphical publication \"Epigraphia Indica\" (1882) as a supplement to the \"Indian Antiquary\". The post of Director General was permanently suspended in 1889 due to a funds crunch and was not restored until 1902. In the interim period, conservation work in the different circles was carried out by the superintendents of the individual circles.\n\nFrom 1888 started severe lobbying aimed at reducing Government expenses, and at curtailing the budget of the Archaeological Survey of India, a period of about ten years known as the \"Buck crisis\", after the Liberal Edward Buck. In effect, this severely threatened the employment of the employees of the ASI, such as Alois Anton Führer, who had just started a family and become a father. \n\nIn 1892, Edward Buck announced that the Archaeological Survey of India would be shut down and all ASI staff would be dismissed by 1895, in order to generate savings for the Government's budget. It was understood that only a fantastic archaeological discovery within the next three years for example might be able to turn public opinion and save the funding of the ASI.\nGreat \"discoveries\" were indeed made with the March 1895 discovery of the Nigali Sagar inscription, which succeeded in bringing the \"Buck Crisis\" to an end, and the ASI was finally allowed in June 1895 to continue operations, subject to yearly approval based on successful digs every year. Georg Bühler, writing in July 1895 in the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society\", continued to advocate for the preservation of the Archaeological Survey of India, and expressed that what was needed were \"new authentic documents\" from the pre-Ashokan period, and they would \"only be found underground\".\n\nAnother momentous discovery would be made in 1896, with the Lumbini pillar inscription, a major inscription on a pillar of Ashoka discovered by Alois Anton Führer. The inscription, together with other evidence, confirmed Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha.\n\nThe organization was rocked when Führer was unmasked in 1898, and was found to file fraudulous reports about his investigations. Confronted by Smith about his archaeological publications and his report to the Government, Führer was obliged to admit \"that every statement in it [the report] was absolutely false.\" Under official instructions from the Government of India, Führer was relieved of his positions, his papers seized and his offices inspected by Vincent Arthur Smith on 22 September 1898. Führer had written in 1897 a monograph on his discoveries in Nigali Sagar and Lumbini, \"Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birth-place in the Nepalese tarai\", which was withdrawn from circulation by the Government. Führer was dismissed and returned to Europe.\n\nThe post of Director General was restored by Lord Curzon in 1902. Breaking with tradition, Curzon chose a 26-year-old professor of classical studies at Cambridge named John Marshall to head the survey. Marshall served as Director General for a quarter of a century and during his long tenure, he replenished and invigorated the survey whose activities were fast dwindling into insignificance. Marshall established the post of Government epigraphist and encouraged epigraphical studies. The most significant event of his tenure was, however, the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization at Harappa and Mohenjodaro in 1921. The success and scale of the discoveries made ensured that the ress made in Marshall's tenure would remain unmatched. Marshall was succeeded by Harold Hargreaves in 1928. Hargreaves was succeeded by Daya Ram Sahni.\n\nSahni was succeeded by J. F. Blakiston and K. N. Dikshit both of whom had participated in the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro. In 1944, a British archaeologist and army officer, Mortimer Wheeler took over as Director General. Wheeler served as Director General till 1948 and during this period he excavated the Iron Age site of Arikamedu and the Stone age sites of Brahmagiri, Chandravalli and Maski in South India. Wheeler founded the journal \"Ancient India\" in 1946 and presided over the partitioning of ASI's assets during the Partition of India and helped establish an archaeological body for the newly formed Pakistan.\n\nWheeler was succeeded by N. P. Chakravarti in 1948. The National Museum was inaugurated in New Delhi on 15 August 1949 to house the artifacts displayed at the Indian Exhibition in the United Kingdom.\n\nMadho Sarup Vats and Amalananda Ghosh succeeded Chakravarti. Ghosh's tenure which lasted until 1968 is noted for the excavations of Indus Valley sites at Kalibangan, Lothal and Dholavira. The \"Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act\" was passed in 1958 bringing the archaeological survey under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture. Ghosh was succeeded by B.B. Lal who conducted archaeological excavations at Ayodhya to investigate whether a Ram Temple preceded the Babri Masjid. During Lal's tenure, the \"Antiquities and Art Treasures Act\" (1972) was passed recommending central protection for monuments considered to be \"of national importance\". Lal was succeeded by M. N. Deshpande who served from 1972 to 1978 and B. K. Thapar who served from 1978 to 1981. On Thapar's retirement in 1981, archaeologist Debala Mitra was appointed to succeed him - she was the first woman Director General of the ASI. Mitra was succeeded by M. S. Nagaraja Rao, who had been transferred from the Karnataka State Department of Archaeology. Archaeologists J. P. Joshi and M. C. Joshi succeeded Rao. M. C. Joshi was the Director General when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992 triggering Hindu-Muslim violence all over India. As a fallout of the demolition, Joshi was dismissed in 1993 and controversially replaced as Director General by Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Achala Moulik, a move which inaugurated a tradition of appointing bureaucrats of the IAS instead of archaeologists to head the survey. The tradition was finally brought to an end in 2010 when Gautam Sengupta an archaeologist, replaced K.M Srivastava an IAS officer as Director General.He was again succeeded by Pravin Srivastava, another IAS officer. Srivastava's successor and the present incumbent, Rakesh Tiwari is also a professional archaeologist.\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India is an attached office of the Ministry of Culture. Under the provisions of the AMASR Act of 1958, the ASI administers more than 3650 ancient monuments, archaeological sites and remains of national importance. These can include everything from temples, mosques, churches, tombs, and cemeteries to palaces, forts, step-wells, and rock-cut caves. The Survey also maintains ancient mounds and other similar sites which represent the remains of ancient habitation.\n\nThe ASI is headed by a Director General who is assisted by an Additional Director General, two Joint Directors General, and 17 Directors.\n\nThe ASI is divided into a total of 29 circles each headed by a Superintending Archaeologist. Each of the circles are further divided into sub-circles. The circles of the ASI are:\n\nThe ASI also administers three \"mini-circles\" at Delhi, Leh and Hampi.\n\nThe Survey has had 29 Directors-General thus far. Its founder, Alexander Cunningham served as Archaeological Surveyor between 1861 and 1865.\n\nIndia's first museum was established by the Asiatic Society in Calcutta in 1814. Much of its collection was passed on to the Indian Museum, which was established in the city in 1866. The Archaeological Survey did not maintain its own museums until the tenure of its third director-general, John Marshall. He initiated the establishment of various museums at Sarnath (1904), Agra (1906), Ajmer (1908), Delhi Fort (1909), Bijapur (1912), Nalanda (1917) and Sanchi (1919). The ASI's museums are customarily located right next to the sites that their inventories are associated with \"so that they may be studied amid their natural surroundings and not lose focus by being transported\".\n\nA dedicated Museums Branch was established in 1946 by Mortimer Wheeler, which now maintains a total of 44 museums spread across the country.\n\nThe ASI maintains a Central Archaeological Library in the Archaeological Survey of India headquarters building in Tilak Marg, Mandi House, New Delhi. Established in 1902, its collection numbers more than 100,000 books and journals. The library is also a repository of rare books, plates, and original drawings.\n\nThe Survey additionally maintains a library in each of its circles to cater to local academics and researchers.\n\nThe day-to-day work of the survey was published in a series of periodical bulletins and reports. The periodicals and archaeological series published by the ASI are:\n\nApart from the ASI, archaeological work in India and conservation of monuments is also carried out in some states by state government archaeological departments. Most of these bodies were set up by the various princely states before independence. When these states were annexed to India after independence, the individual archaeological departments of these states were not integrated with the ASI. Instead, they were allowed to function as independent bodies.\n\nDepartment of archaeology and museum, Government of West Bengal\n\nIn 2013, a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report found that at least 92 centrally protected monuments of historical importance across the country which have gone missing without a trace. The CAG could physically verify only 45% of the structures (1,655 out of 3,678). The CAG report said that the ASI did not have reliable information on the exact number of monuments under its protection. The CAG recommended that periodic inspection of each protected monument should be done by a suitably ranked officer. The Culture ministry accepted the proposal. Author and IIPM Director Arindam Chaudhuri said that since the ASI is unable to protect the country's museums and monuments so they should be professionally maintained by private companies or through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model.\n\nIn May 2018, the Supreme Court of India said that the ASI was not properly discharging its duty in maintaining the World Heritage Site of Taj Mahal and asked the Government of India to consider whether some other agency be given the responsibility to protect and preserve it.\n\nThe fictional character Kakababu, in Sunil Gangopadhyay's famed Kakababu series, is an ex-Director of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\n\n"}

The city had previously sent such waste to New Jersey, but that state refused to accept any more after 1984.\n\nThe company handling the waste (Joseph Paolino and Sons) subcontracted shipment to Amalgamated Shipping Corp and Coastal Carrier Inc, operators of \"Khian Sea\". The latter intended to dump the ash in the Bahamas. However, the Bahamian government turned the ship away, and Philadelphia withheld payment to the companies because the waste was not disposed of.\n\nOver the next 16 months, \"Khian Sea\" searched all over the Atlantic for a place to dump its cargo. Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, Bermuda, Guinea Bissau and the Dutch Antilles refused. Its return to Philadelphia also failed. In January 1988, the crew finally dumped 4,000 tons of the waste near Gonaïves in Haiti as \"topsoil fertilizer\". When Greenpeace informed the Haitian government of the origin of the waste, the Haitian commerce minister ordered the crew to reload the ash, but the ship slipped away. The Haitian government subsequently banned all waste imports. Local cleanup crews later buried some of the waste in a bunker inland, but the rest remained on the beach.\n\nNext the crew of \"Khian Sea\" tried to unload the rest of the cargo in Senegal, Morocco, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka and Singapore. After repairs in Yugoslavia, the ship's name changed to \"Felicia\", and registered in Honduras. Later it was renamed \"Pelicano\". These changes failed to hide the ship's original identity.\n\nThe rest of the ash disappeared en route from Singapore to Sri Lanka in November 1988. The crew refused to comment but eventually the ship's captain admitted that they had dumped the remaining 10,000 tons of the waste into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 1993, two owners of Coastal Carrier were convicted of perjury, having ordered the dumping.\n\nOver the years, various attempts to return the ash dumped in Haiti failed.\n\nIn 1997, New York City Trade Waste Commission investigated Eastern Environmental Services whose owner was part of Joseph Paolino and Sons. They agreed to give the company a license to operate in New York City in condition that it would contribute to the cleanup in Haiti. Eastern Environmental Services agreed to take the waste back. Greenpeace and Haitian environmental groups launched a \"Project Return to Sender\" to lobby for funds. City of Philadelphia contributed $50,000.\n\nIn April 2000, Waste Management Inc. in Haiti loaded 2,500 tons of ash and contaminated soil onto the barge \"Santa Lucia\" and shipped it to Florida, where the barge was docked in the St. Lucie Canal. It remained there until June 2002 when it was moved to Mountain View Reclamation Landfill, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania near Antrim Township, after several government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, had found the contents to be classified as nonhazardous waste.\n\nThe case contributed to the creation of the Basel Convention about disposal of hazardous waste.\n"}

Provided with a tollgate, the wooden bridge was located upstream from the ford, and collapsed in 1847. It was again rebuilt in wood in 1848, and was damaged by flood in 1852 and later repaired. A bluestone bridge was built in 1859, which still exists today as a service road. The current concrete bridge of the Midland Highway was built in 1972 on a new alignment.\n\nThe first river crossing at Fyansford was again a ford.\n\nThe first wooden bridge was built downriver from the ford by the Shire of Corio and Shire of Bannockburn in 1854, and was tolled until 1877. It was in poor condition by 1898, with load restrictions being put into place. A new bridge was built nearby in 1900 by John Monash and J. T. N.

He founded Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie.\n\nGeorge Wombwell was born in Wendon Lofts, Essex in 1777. Around 1800 he moved to London and in 1804 became a shoemaker in Soho. However, when a ship from South America brought two boas to London docks, he bought them for £75 and began to exhibit them in taverns. He soon made a good profit.\n\nWombwell began to buy exotic animals from ships that came from Africa, Australia and South America, and collected a whole menagerie and put them on display in Soho. In 1810 he founded the Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie and began to tour the fairs of Britain. By 1839 it totalled fifteen wagons, and was accompanied by a brass band.\n\nHis travelling menagerie included elephants, giraffes, a gorilla, a hyena, kangaroo, leopards, 6 lions, llamas, monkeys, ocelots, onagers, ostriches, panthers, a rhino (\"the real unicorn of scripture\"), 3 tigers, wildcats and zebras. However, because many of the animals were from hotter climes, many of them died in the British climate. Sometimes Wombwell could profitably sell the body to a taxidermist or a medical school, other times he chose to exhibit the dead animal as a curiosity.\n\nWombwell bred and raised many animals himself, including the first lion to be bred in captivity in Britain; he named it William in honour of William Wallace. In 1825 Warwick, Wombwell, in collaboration with Sam Wedgbury and dog dealer Ben White's assistant Bill George, arranged a Lion-baiting between his docile lion Nero and six bulldogs. Nero refused to fight but when Wombwell released Wiliam, he mauled the dogs and the fight was soon stopped.\n\nOver the years, Wombwell expanded three menageries that traveled around the country. Wombwell was a regular exhibitor at the annual Knott Mill Fair in Manchester, a venue he sometimes shared with Pablo Fanque's circus. He was invited to the royal court on five occasions to exhibit his animals, three times before Queen Victoria.\n\nOn one occasion Prince Albert summoned him to look at his dogs who kept dying and Wombwell quickly noticed that their water was poisoning them. When the prince asked what he could do in return for this favour, Wombwell said, \"What can you give a man who has everything?\" However, Wombwell requested some oak timber from the recently salvaged Royal George. From this he had a coffin fashioned for himself, which he then proceeded to exhibit for a special fee.\n\nWombwell frequented Bartholomew Fair in London and even developed a rivalry with another exhibitor, Atkins. Once when he arrived at the fair, his elephant died and Atkins put up a sign \"The Only Live Elephant in the Fair\". Wombwell simply put up a scroll with the words \"The Only Dead Elephant in the Fair\" and explained that seeing a dead elephant was an even a rarer thing than a live one. The public, realising that they could see a living elephant at any time, flocked to see and poke the dead one. Throughout the fair Atkins' menagerie was largely deserted, much to his disgust.\n\nGeorge Wombwell died in 1850 and was buried in his Royal George coffin in Highgate Cemetery, under a statue of his lion Nero.\n\nThe book \"George Wombwell (1777 - 1850): Volume One\" recalls the lion and dog fight in Warwick with well researched evidence, but questions whether it ever actually took place. \"George Wombwell (1777 - 1850): Volume Two\" covers Wombwell's life as the most famous showman, from his arrival in London around 1800 to his death in 1850.\n\nIn 1851 a tapir broke out of its den at Wombwell's Menagerie in Rochdale, causing panic among the spectators.\n\nIn the Sherlock Holmes short story The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger the lion tamer, Ronder is described thus: \"Ronder, of course, was a household word. He was the rival of Wombwell\".\n\n\n"}

He had hidden from them in a pātaka, a food-storage pit, and climbed back into the light to be met by a chief friendly to him – Te Whareangi (the \"hairy man\").\n\nThe haka as composed by Te Rauparaha begins with a chant:\nThen follows the main body of the haka:\n\"Ka Mate\" was conceived as a brief energizing haka of the \"ngeri\" type, where, in the absence of set movements, the performers are free to extemporize their chanting and movement as they feel fit, without any need for synchronization.\n\n\"Ka Mate\" is the most widely known haka in New Zealand and internationally because a choreographed and synchronized version of the chant has traditionally been performed by the All Blacks, New Zealand's international rugby union team, as well as the Kiwis, New Zealand's international rugby league team, immediately prior to test (international) matches. Since 2005 the All Blacks have occasionally performed another haka, \"Kapa o Pango\". Since the introduction of \"Kapa o Pango\" the longest sequence of \"Ka Mate\" performances by the All Blacks is nine, which occurred between 22 August 2009 and 12 June 2010.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN shortly before the 2019 Rugby World Cup, All Blacks scrum-half TJ Perenara, the team's designated haka leader at the time and a Māori who was raised in the region where Te Rauparaha lived, explained the process of selecting which haka will be performed before a given match:\n\nBetween 1998 and 2006, Ngāti Toa attempted to trademark \"Ka Mate\" to prevent its use by commercial organisations without their permission. In 2006, the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand declined their claim on the grounds that \"Ka Mate\" had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader. In March 2011, New Zealand Rugby Union came to an amicable agreement with the iwi not to bring the mana of the haka into disrepute.\n\nIn 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the New Zealand government agreed to:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2142553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142553", "title": "George Steer", "text": "George Steer\n\nGeorge Lowther Steer (1909 – 25 December 1944) was a South African-born British journalist, author and war correspondent who reported on wars preceding World War II, especially the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War. During those wars he was employed by \"The Times\", and his eye-witness reports did much to alert western nations of war crimes committed by the Italians in Ethiopia and by the Germans in Spain, although little was done to prevent them by the League of Nations. He returned to Ethiopia after the world war started and helped the campaign defeat the Italians and restore Hailie Selassie to the throne.\n\nGeorge Steer was born in South Africa in 1909, the son of a newspaper manager. He studied classics in England, at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. He began his journalistic career in South Africa, then worked in London for the \"Yorkshire Post\".\n\nIn 1935 Steer covered the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, also known as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, for \"The Times\". He reported that Italian forces made extensive use of poison gas in the form of mustard gas and also bombed Red Cross ambulances, despite clear markings of the red cross. He was involved in helping to transport gas masks to Ethiopia to give at least some protection against the poison gases deployed illegally by the Italians. He became friendly with Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, who later became godfather to Steer's son. He met and married his first wife in Ethiopia, under difficult conditions in the British Legation in Addis Ababa, with looting and rifle fire outside the gates of the compound. His wife and his first child died in childbirth in London a little later.\n\nIn 1937 he was sent to report on the Spanish Civil War. His first reports from the Basque country described how British merchant ships beat the Nationalist blockade of Bilbao to bring food to the starving people of the town and surrounding region. He also visited the front line on several occasions to report directly on the fighting.\n\nHe won prominence with his scoop report on the bombing of Guernica on 26 April 1937. His telegram to London described German bomb casings (inscribed with the words \"Rheindorf 1936\", with the German eagle insignia), and the use of thermite as an incendiary to create a firestorm in the center of the town. High explosive bombs were used to create blast damage to wooden structures, which could then be ignited more easily by the incendiaries. His reporting did much to inspire Pablo Picasso to record the atrocity for posterity in his massive painting. It also alerted western governments to the way the Germans were preparing to use terror bombing as a way to intimidate civilians. His reports were directly contradicted by the Nationalists, who said that the damage was caused by the Government forces themselves, a common ploy by fascist and nazi propagandists. Steer responded to such reports by providing details of the damage in the town (such as bomb craters) and the Luftwaffe aircraft used in the attack, such as Heinkel He 111 bombers. Although he was not an eye-witness to the bombing itself, he arrived soon afterwards, and so was able to see the effects and talk to some of the survivors. He was one of the last journalists to leave Bilbao as the Nationalists advanced, and fled to Santander to the west.\n\nThe anti-Fascist tone of Steer's reporting led \"The Times\" to dispense with his services; the newspaper's editorial stance on the war was apparently neutral, whilst its editor, Geoffrey Dawson, privately sympathised with the Nationalists under Francisco Franco. However the newspaper had a general policy of appeasement when it came to Germany, the Nazis and Fascism. \nSteer returned to South Africa and, in his book \"Judgment on German Africa\", documented Germany's attempts to subvert its former African colonies, especially the Cameroon, South West Africa (now known as Namibia), Tanganyika and Togoland.\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, the \"Daily Telegraph\" dispatched Steer to Finland to cover the Winter War, when Finland was attacked by the Soviet Union in November 1939. Steer saw the effects of aerial bombing of several Finnish towns by the Soviets, attempts made to intimidate the population, just like at Guernica. But by contrast with Ethiopia and Spain, western countries such as Britain and France (and nazi Germany) were only too eager to offer arms and equipment as well as volunteers to assist the Finns. The war was of relatively short duration owing to the disparity in armed might, although the Russian casualties were much greater than those of the Finns. An armistice was signed in March, 1940 and Finland lost about 10% of her territory to the Soviets.\nWhen Italy declared war on Britain, plans were laid to invade Ethiopia from Kenya and the Sudan, with the aim of toppling the Italian regime and re-instating Hailie Selassie as Emperor. Steer was appointed as an officer in the Intelligence Corps of the British Army, initially to chaperone Selassie from London to the Sudan (under the pseudonym, \"Mr Smith\" since the position of the Emperor had to be kept secret from the Italians). He was then put in charge of a mobile propaganda unit to undermine the Italian garrisons by leafletting, loudspeaker attacks and so on. The campaign was remarkably successful, with many Italian troops deserting to become prisoners, and Ethiopians transferring allegiance. Steer broadcast light Italian operas and news from the Italian front in Libya, where the British army had great successes against much larger Italian forces in 1941. The military campaign waged by British and Ethiopian soldiers was very successful, using a combination of regular troops and irregular forces led by Orde Wingate. They entered Addis Ababa in triumph in April 1941 to accept the defeat of the Italians.\n\nIn May 1936, as looters ravaged Addis Ababa around him, and while taking a break from rescue work, Steer married French newspaper correspondent Margarita Herrero. A short while afterwards he was deported by the Italian authorities, along with other Europeans, for aiding the opposition Abyssinians.\n\nMargarita Steer died in childbirth in London while George Steer was reporting on the Spanish Civil War. He later married Esme Barton.\n\nIn 2006 the town of Guernica honored George Steer unveiling a bronze bust and naming a street in his memory. Also in 2010 the City of Bilbao (Spain) dedicated George Steer Street, with Steer's son and granddaughter attending the ceremony.\n\nIn June 1940 Steer joined the British Army and led an Ethiopian Forward Propaganda unit when British troops began to fight Italian troops in the country. After the defeat of the Italians in Ethiopia in 1941, Steer was influential in restoring Haile Selassie to the throne. Later Steer was sent to India to lead a Field Propaganda Unit in Burma. The unit tried to break Japanese morale by loudspeakers with speeches and sentimental music. He was successively promoted from Lieutenant to Captain, Major and finally, Lieutenant-colonel, and was attached to the Special Operations Executive. His work was appreciated and promoted by General Slim, the local army commander, who wanted to expand the operation.\n\nGeorge Steer died in the crash of a heavily loaded Army Jeep, which he was driving, in Burma on 25 December 1944 on the way to a Christmas party.\n\n\n"}

Such a ball is often dangerously close to the batsman's head, due to the lack of control a bowler has over high full tosses. Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it.\n\nThis type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty is an immediate no-ball and, in Twenty20 and one-day matches, a free hit. The use of beamers is governed under Law 41.7. The bowler is then given a warning by the umpire for dangerous bowling. Repeated or deliberate cases may result in the bowler being barred from bowling again for the remainder of the innings (or match), as happened with Waqar Younis in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Fast bowlers, particularly younger players yet to fully refine their techniques, are likely to bowl such deliveries more often than other bowlers, albeit accidentally.\nA beamer may not necessarily be bowled with intent. It may be due to sweaty hands or a wet ball causing a slipped release from the hand. It is also possible that the bowler attempts to bowl a Yorker which will goes askew.\n\nA bowler can legally target the batsman with a ball aimed at his head that bounces, called a bouncer. These are easier to play or avoid than beamers.\n\nAbdur Rehman, a Pakistani spin bowler, bowled three consecutive beamers in the 2014 Asia Cup against Bangladesh, and was banned from the match without actually bowling a single legitimate ball, despite giving away 8 runs. This was the first time this happened in the history of cricket.\n\n"}

Despite his father's desire that he should attend the University of Glasgow and then become a Presbyterian minister, de la Pryme insisted on attending the University of Cambridge, becoming a pensioner of St John's College in 1690.

His father, Andrzej, was a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman from the Ogiński family and governor of Troki, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His mother, Paulina Szembek (1740–1797), was the daughter of Polish magnate, Marek Szembek, whose ancestors were Austrian, and Jadwiga Rudnicka, who was of Lithuanian descent. His first introduction to music arose during a visit to relatives at Słonim where Michał Kazimierz Ogiński had a contemporary European theatre that hosted opera and ballet productions. Michał Kleofas received an Enlightenment gentleman's education.\nHe studied music with Osip Kozlovsky and took violin lessons from Giovanni Battista Viotti and Pierre Baillot.\n\nAged only 20, Ogiński was chosen as an envoy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He served as an adviser to King Stanisław August Poniatowski and supported him during the Great Sejm of 1788–1792. In 1788 he received the Order of Saint Stanislaus and in 1789 - the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest order. In 1790 he was dispatched as a diplomatic representative to the United Kingdom, where he met with Lord Mansfield who warned him about the danger posed by the tri-partite powers about to dismember the Kingdom of Poland. After 1790, he was sent to The Hague as a diplomatic representative of Poland to the Netherlands and was Polish agent in Constantinople and Paris. In 1793, he was nominated to the office of Vice-Treasurer of Lithuania.\n\nDuring the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, Ogiński commanded his own unit. After the insurrection was suppressed, he emigrated to Constantinople and later to France, where he sought support for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. At that time he saw the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw by the Emperor as a stepping stone to eventual full independence of the Commonwealth. He dedicated his only opera, \"Zelis et Valcour\", to Napoleon. In 1810, Ogiński withdrew from political activity in exile and, disappointed with Napoleon, returned to Vilnius. Adam Jerzy Czartoryski introduced him to Tsar Alexander I, who made Ogiński a Russian Senator. Ogiński tried in vain to convince the Tsar to reconstitute the former Commonwealth. Disillusioned, he moved abroad in 1815. He died in Florence in 1833.\n\nAs a composer, he is best known for his polonaise \"Farewell to My Homeland\" (\"Pożegnanie Ojczyzny\"), written in 1794 in the Zalesie region (then part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, today in Belarus), on the occasion of his emigration after the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising. This piece, with its unreservedly melancholic melodies and fantasia-like passages, can be considered among the earliest examples of romantic music.\n\nOgiński admired French and Italian opera. He was a violinist, and played the clavichord and the balalaika. He began composing marches and military songs in the 1790s that gained popularity among the rebels of 1794. He composed some 20 polonaises, piano pieces, mazurkas, marches, romances and waltzes.\n\nSome of his other popular works and compositions include:\n\n"}

She was a menial servant in the kitchen of George-Lewis Scott. In around 1762 or 1763, while still in her teens, she began her career of wandering around England “imposing on the compassion and credulity of different persons in town and country”. A newspaper report from Devizes in Wiltshire in 1767 said,\n“It seems this woman has, for some time past, been travelling through almost all parts of the Kingdom, assuming various titles and characters, at different times and places: she has presented herself to be of high birth and distinction, as well foreign and English, and accordingly stiling herself a Princess of Mecklenburgh, Countess of Normandy, Lady Countess Wilbrahammon, &c. &c. and under some or other of such names making promises of providing, by means of her weight and interest, for the families of … the lower class of people; unto those of higher rank in life she has represented herself to be in the greatest distress, abandoned and deserted by her parents and friends of considerable family, either upon account of an unfortunate love affair, or of religion, pretending to be a Protestant against the will of her relations, who were Roman Catholicks, and always varying the account of herself as she chanced to pick up intelligence of characters and connections of those she intended to deceive and impose upon … She is a short woman, slender made, of a pale complexion, something deformed, has a speck or knell over one eye.” \n\nIn November 1767 Sir John Fielding sent Wilson to Tothill Fields Bridewell to await trial for obtaining a set of expensive clothes by false pretenses. At the Westminster Quarter Sessions in January 1768 Wilson was sentenced to penal transportation to the American colonies. \n\nAccording to an advertisement dated October 11, 1771, reprinted in Rivington’s \"New York Gazetteer\" for May 13, 1773, Wilson was sold to William Devall, or Duvall, of Bush-Creek, Frederick County, Maryland as a convict servant maid, and had escaped from him. \n\nWilson travelled through Virginia and the Carolinas as Princess Sophia Carolina Augusta, Queen Charlotte’s sister, where,\n“… she travelled from one gentleman’s house to another … and made astonishing impressions in many places, affecting the mode of royalty so inimitably, that many had the honour to kiss her hand; to some she promised governments, to others regiments, with promotions of all kinds, in the Treasury, Army and in the Royal Navy … [and]… levied heavy contributions upon some persons of the highest rank in the Southern colonies.” \n\nFrom July to November 1772 Wilson appears to have been using Charleston, South Carolina as a base for her exploits. She returned to Charleston in February 1773, where she took up lodgings in King Street. It appears that the newspaper reports of her travels came to the attention of William Devall, who sent an agent to Charleston to capture her. If so, it appears that she might have bought her freedom with her ill-gotten gains for she turned up in New York in August 1773 as there was no indication in the report of her arrival in New York, nor in any of the subsequent news stories about her, that she was a wanted fugitive. \n\nWilson stayed in Boston from 7 December 1773 to 11 January 1774 as Princess Carolina Matilda, Princess of Cronenburgh, Marchioness de Waldegrave. She might have been one of those who watched the Sons of Liberty throwing the chests of tea from the three ships in Boston Harbour on the night of 16 December 1773. \nWilson later gave herself another title, Princess of Browtonsburgh, and, while still maintaining her royal pretentions, decided to play the religious card, becoming the house-guest of Congregationalists in puritan New England, some of whom were also actively involved in the revolutionary cause at the onset of the American War of Independence. \n\nWilson died at Berwick, Maine on 23 February 1780. \n\nThere are a number of untrue stories about Sarah Wilson. The first appeared in Rivington’s New York Gazetteer on 13 May 1773 that Wilson was a maidservant to Caroline Vernon, lady-in-waiting for Queen Charlotte, and began to steal the jewellery and clothing of the queen. She was apprehended and first condemned to death but eventually the sentence was commuted to penal transportation to the American colonies. This story was reprinted in several American and English newspapers, as well as the Gentleman’s and London Magazines. While much of the detail in the report in Rivington’s New York Gazetteer is either true, or likely to be true, the record is clear that Wilson was transported for obtaining clothes by false pretenses from a Mrs Davenport. There is no record of Queen Charlotte’s jewels or clothes being stolen.\n\nLater inventions were that she was dragged back to Bush Creek where she remained for two years before escaping again. She later married a British army officer named William Talbot, moved to New York, had a large family and lived happily ever after. \n\n"}

The foundation was created by Nevada-based real estate millionaire Michael Oliver, his friend James Murt McKeever, and investment advisor Harry D. Schultz.\nIn 1972 the Foundation began to construct a platform in the South Pacific. Part of a reef, normally a metre below sea level at high tide, was piled high with sand and a small stone platform was erected carrying the flag of the Republic of Minerva—a white torch on a blue background. The 'President of Minerva,' Morris Davis, declared at the time: \"People will be free to do as they damn well please. Nothing will be illegal so long it does not infringe on the rights of others. If a citizen wishes to open a tavern, set up gambling or make pornographic films, the government will not interfere.\" Tonga's claim to the reef was recognized by the South Pacific Forum in September 1972. A Tongan expedition was sent to enforce the claim, arriving on 18 June 1972. The Flag of Tonga was raised on 19 June 1972 on North Minerva and on South Minerva on 21 June 1972.\n\nThe Foundation's next attempt to establish a libertarian state was in 1973 on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas. In the period approaching Bahamian independence, a number of white residents objected to living under black rule. In June 1973, one month before the intended independence, the Foundation financed Chuck Hall and Bert Williams' Abaco Independence Movement (AIM), which sought to make Abaco independent of the Bahamas. With the financial support of the Phoenix Foundation the AIM published a newsletter, \"The Abaco Independent\".\nIn 1980, Michael Oliver allied with Jimmy Stevens of the New Hebrides Autonomy Movement in Vanuatu, which had been unsuccessful in recent elections. NHAM (or MANH) declared an independent Republic of Vemerana in the island of Espiritu Santo. The government of Vanuatu appealed for aid from Papua New Guinea, which sent a battalion of soldiers to stop the rebellion.\n\nDuring the attempt in Vanuatu, NPR described the Phoenix Foundation \"a sinister right-wing organization\". Instituto del Tercer Mundo (Third World Institute), alleged \"Jimmy Stevens received $250,000, arms and a radio from the Phoenix Foundation, an ultra-right US organization, in return for concessions to install a casino and, allegedly, cover for illicit activities from Stevens' Republic of Vemarana.\"\n"}

He wrote poetry in Middle High German and was author of noted works about how knights and nobles may lead more virtuous lives. Ulrich was a member of a wealthy and influential ministerialis family from in Styria. He was born about 1200 at Murau in the Duchy of Styria, located in the present-day country of Austria.\n\nDetails of Ulrich's life are difficult to ascertain, for much of what scholars know relies heavily upon information gleaned from his often-fictional, self-styled autobiographical work the \"Frauendienst\" (trans. \"Service of Ladies\"). Separating fact from stylized hyperbole has proven difficult for historians.\n\nFrom age 12 on, Ulrich received noble training as a page to a lady of much higher station than he then another four years as a squire to Margrave Henry of Istria, son of Duke Berthold IV of Merania, he was knighted by the Babenberg duke Leopold VI of Austria in 1222. Ulrich is documented as a Styrian \"Truchsess\" in 1244/45, from 1267 to 1272 Marshal and in year 1272 also a provincial judge.\n\nWhen Philip of Sponheim, the Archbishop-Elect of Salzburg, was deposed by Pope Alexander IV for refusing to take holy orders, Philip raised an army to defend his title. In 1250, Ulrich agreed to fight for Philip's cause in return for Philip's arranging a beneficial marriage of Ulrich's son, Ulrich II, to Kunigunde of Goldegg and Philip added a dowry of 400 Salzburg pounds to the agreement. In return Ulrich I agreed to provide Philip with 100 fighting men for his cause. In August 1252 Philip's forces decisively defeated his enemies at the Battle of Sachsenburg on the Drava, and Ulrich was one of seven who mediated the ensuing peace.\n\nLeader of the Styrian nobility, Ulrich had a hand in absorbing the duchy into the possessions of Rudolph of Habsburg after the ducal House of Babenberg had become extinct in 1246. It is possible that Ulrich was one of the noblemen taken prisoner by King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1269. He owned three castles, besides Liechtenstein another at Strechau near Lassing in the Enns Valley and the third at his birthplace Murau. When his son Ulrich II married, Ulrich bestowed upon the couple the castle of Murau along with twenty vassals and revenue.\n\nMany aspects of his life are unrecorded, but some genealogy survives. He had a brother named Hartnid who served as Bishop of Gurk from 1283 to 1298 and a brother named Dietmar IV of Liechtenstein-Offenburg, who had a son named Gundaker. Besides Ulrich's son, Ulrich II, he had a daughter named Diemut (who married Wulfing of Trennstein), a son named Otto II and a son-in-law named Herrand II of Wildon by an unnamed daughter.\n\nUlrich died on 26 January 1275. He was buried in Seckau in modern-day Austria.\n\nUlrich wrote his stories at a time when knightly ideals were just being promulgated from Western Europe. He outlines rules for knights, ministeriales, and free nobles to follow to lead honorable and courtly lives. There are several instances where he places the (unfree) ministerials and the free nobles in one category separate from the knights to point out the nobility of his own estate.\n\nUlrich is famous for his supposedly autobiographical poetry collection \"Frauendienst\" (\"Service of the Lady\"). He writes of himself as a protagonist who does great deeds of honor to married noblewomen, following the conventions of chaste courtly love. The protagonist embarks on two remarkable quests. In the first quest, he travels from Venice to Vienna in the guise of Venus, the goddess of love. He competes in jousts and tourneys and challenges all the knights he meets to a duel in the honour of his lady. He breaks 307 lances and defeats all comers. The noblewoman, however, mostly spurns his affections and demands more deeds and even mutilation for even the honour to hold her hand. In the second quest, he takes on the role of King Arthur (\"Artus\"), with his followers becoming Arthurian Round Table characters. Regrettably, the first two pages of the beginning have been lost to time. The protagonist, Ulrich, wanders through Styria and Austria in the guise of King Arthur inviting all knights to \"break lance\" (that is, to joust) three times with him for honor's sake. In this disguise he attended many tournaments. The story illustrates how a worthy knight-errant was supposed to wander about defeating opponents in honorable combat. The story intersperses some songs and courtly advice to knights and some admonitions to greedy nobles and faithless squires. The collection was finished in 1255.\n\n\"Frauenbuch\" was a dialogue set in 1240, published in 1257, lamenting the decay of chivalric courtship.\n\nThe protagonist of the 2001 film \"A Knight's Tale\", played by Heath Ledger, assumes the title Ulrich von Liechtenstein when he poses as a knight. Being undefeated in jousts, this was a worthy man's name to take. The name also proved to work well in the plot and provided the necessary contrast to the hero's true name, William Thatcher. However, the character claims to come from Gelderland, which was not in Styria but rather in the Low Countries.\n\n"}

He, using the title \"Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtney, King of Jerusalem\", along with several of his followers, was killed in a confrontation with soldiers in Bossenden Wood, in what has sometimes been called the last battle to be fought on English soil.\n\nJohn Nichols Tom (or Thom) was born the son of innkeepers in 1799 at St Columb Major, Cornwall. He was baptised in the parish church on 10 November 1799. His parents were William and Charity Tom who kept the Joiners' Arms. Tom went to school in Penryn, attending Bellevue Academy (a \"Classical and Commercial Academy\"). At the age of about fourteen he transferred to the private school in Launceston that was run by Reverend Richard Cope, pastor of the local Congregational Church.\n\nTom stayed at school until he was eighteen and was then articled to solicitor Mr Paynter of St Columb. He decided, however, against a career in the law and left after three years. After a short spell as an innkeeper in Wadebridge he settled down as a clerk in the firm of Lubbock and Co, wine merchants of Truro, and took over the business when the partners retired, extending it to include malting. In 1821 he married Catherine Fisher Fulpitt, the daughter of a market gardener in Truro. Tom was a tall, strongly built, good-looking man, who became known in Truro for his skill as a cricketer. During a visit to London he joined the Spencean Society.\n\nWhen Tom was in his late twenties a series of disasters struck. His mother Charity was removed to Cornwall Lunatic Asylum in 1827, and died there. Then, in 1828, his business premises in Pydar Street burnt down. Tom claimed the insurance and was able to rebuild the premises. At the Quarter Sessions held at Bodmin on 15 July 1828, Tom applied successfully for the return of £304 paid in excise duty on malt destroyed in the fire at his malthouse on 17 June 1828. In 1831 Tom received treatment from a surgeon for an attack of insanity but recovered and the following spring sailed from Truro to Liverpool with a cargo of malt. He wrote to his wife from Liverpool to tell her he had sold the malt, and wrote again from Birmingham to tell her he was going to France. Nothing more was heard from him until over a year later, when his family heard that a man who fitted his description and went by the name of Sir William Courtenay was being held in Maidstone prison.\n\nIn September 1832 Thom arrived in Canterbury, dressed in exotic costumes and wearing long hair and a beard. He put up at the Rose Inn at the junction of Rose Lane and the main street and went first by the name of Count Rothschild, and then by the name of Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta, heir to the Earl of Devon and the Kentish estates of Sir Edward Hales.\n\nAlthough many people realized he was an imposter he nevertheless became a colourful and popular figure in the town, partly because he frequently made comical and insulting speeches directed at the unpopular mayor and magistrates of the city and the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the December 1832 general election Liberal support in the town was so strong that the Conservatives decided not to field candidates. Stung by jeers about not standing, some local Conservatives asked Tom to stand as an independent candidate for Canterbury, hoping he would inconvenience the Liberals. He polled a creditable 375 votes (against 834 for Richard Watson and 802 for Viscount Fordwich, the Liberal candidates). He then decided to stand in the East Kent election, but polled only three votes, and turned his attention to publishing a weekly paper, \"The Lion\". Eight issues of the paper were produced. Full of biblical quotations, it argued for the rights of the poor, expressed loyalty to the Crown, and was critical of the clergy, aristocracy, town corporations and Parliament. Tom's biographer described the views expressed in \"The Lion\" as showing \"amazing common sense... far in advance of those generally held in his time\", for example, regarding rents, taxation, the Irish problem, and corporal punishment, although these \"occasional shafts of light\" were surrounded by \"turgid nonsense\".\n\nAt the beginning of March 1833, Thom intervened in the case of some Faversham smugglers, acting as a witness for the defence. The smugglers were nevertheless convicted, and Tom was prosecuted for perjury. His trial took place on 25 July at the Kent Summer Assizes at Maidstone before Mr Justice Parke and a crowded court. Evidence was heard from the Vicar of Boughton-under-Blean that Tom had been at church when he claimed to have witnessed events off the Goodwin Sands. In spite of the testimony of a number of character witnesses, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and Tom was sentenced to three months imprisonment and seven years transportation to Australia.\n\nTom's family in Truro had heard about the trial and Catherine Tom arrived in Maidstone in August to see if Courtenay was her missing husband. He was produced by the governor of Maidstone Gaol and she made a positive identification. Although Tom always denied any connection with the Truro family, Catherine Tom was believed. She told the authorities about her husband's previous attack of insanity; he was then examined by two surgeons who declared him of unsound mind. Tom was transferred to Barming Heath Asylum on 28 October 1833.\n\nTom was a model patient in the asylum and in 1837 the superintendent suggested to his wife that she should petition the home secretary for his release. Tom's father in Truro brought his son's case to the attention of Sir Hussey Vivian, the Liberal candidate for East Cornwall in the August 1837 election. Vivian, after his election, took the matter up with the home secretary, Lord John Russell, and Tom was granted a free pardon by Queen Victoria, on condition he was returned into the care of his family in Cornwall. Thom was still refusing to acknowledge the Cornish family and, instead of returning to Cornwall, went to live with a local farmer and supporter, Mr Francis of Fairbrook, Boughton-under-Blean, who had offered to be his guardian. This was permitted, due to some ambiguous wording on the pardon, and in October 1837, four years after his admission to the asylum, Tom was released.\n\nBy January 1838, Tom had fallen out with Mr Francis, and he spent the next few months riding through East Kent, relying on the hospitality of supporters. With promises of a better future, fairer distribution of wealth and greater equality, he attracted a following of agricultural labourers, artisans and small-holders. In particular, he addressed their concerns about low wages, lack of work, and the New Poor Law, which ordered all able-bodied men to workhouses if they could not find work. Until the end of May, the activities of Tom and his small band of followers were entirely peaceful as they marched around the local countryside trying to drum up support amongst the workers. Some wealthier landowners were however becoming alarmed and, on 31 May 1838, a local magistrate, Dr Poore, issued a warrant for Tom's arrest for inciting workmen to leave their work.\n\nEarly on the morning of 31 May, the parish constable of Boughton-under-Blean enlisted the help of his assistant and also of his brother, Nicholas Mears, and set off to find Tom. When they arrived at Bossenden Farm, where Tom and his followers were staying, Tom shot and killed Nicholas Mears. The constable and his assistant fled. News of the murder reached the magistrates and soldiers were called out from the barracks at Canterbury. A detachment of the 45th Infantry under Major Armstrong, with three junior officers and about one hundred men, met up with the magistrates and tracked Tom and his followers down to a clearing in Bossenden Wood. Tom's followers numbered between thirty and forty (a few having managed to escape after the killing of the constable), and, with the exception of Tom and one other who had pistols, were armed only with sticks. As the soldiers advanced, Lieutenant Bennet was shot dead by Tom. In the ensuing confrontation, which lasted only a few minutes, Tom and eight of his followers were killed or mortally wounded by the soldiers, and a young special constable who was helping the soldiers was caught in their fire and killed. One soldier was slightly injured by a stick.\n\nTom's body, together with those of his followers who had been killed, was taken to the Red Lion Inn at Dunkirk. The inn was besieged by souvenir and relic hunters, and the simply curious. The landlord of Red Lion claimed 20,000 people had visited the neighbourhood over the next few days. Tom's biographer describes public feeling:\n\n\"This was an insignificant casualty list as battles go; but it was a terrible price to pay for the capture, dead, of one man. When the disastrous results of the affray became known, public opinion was deeply shocked at what seemed an unnecessary loss of life. The repercussions of the Battle of Bossenden wood were soon, in fact, to reach Westminster itself.\"\n\nAn inquest was held at the White Horse, Boughton, the Saturday after the battle, with the jury returning a verdict of \"justifiable homicide\" on the deaths of Tom and his followers. On the following Tuesday Tom was buried in Hernhill cemetery.\n\nFew of Tom's followers had been arrested at the scene of the battle, but some were picked up over the next few days. Thirty men and two women were arrested, and of these ten were tried for murder - two for the murder of the constable's brother and nine for the murder of Bennett (with Thomas Mears being charged with both). Thomas Mears and William Price were convicted of the murder of the constable's brother, then the rest pleaded guilty. Thomas Mears and William Wills were transported for life, William Price for ten years, and the others received one year's imprisonment.\n\nLocal magistrates and politicians, especially Lord John Russell, were attacked for their role in the affair. There were accusations that Sir Hussey Vivian had requested Tom's release in return for his father's vote. A parliamentary select committee was appointed and sat for three days in June. Barrister Frederick Liardet was sent to survey the area for the Central Society of Education, and a school and a church were built in Dunkirk. Journalists talked of the ignorance and moral degradation of the area. Feargus O'Connor suggested a monument should be erected in memory of Courtenay's followers.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1925, she and Bloch (they remained business partners after the divorce) founded an economic newspaper, \"La Gazette du Franc et des Nations\". Hanau used the newspaper to dispense stock tips to financial speculators.\n\nHanau's paper promoted mainly the stocks and securities of her own business partners, whose businesses were mere shells or paper companies. Still, the value of their stock kept rising when stockbrokers bought and traded them. Hanau expanded her investing advice network and later formed her own financial news agency, \"Agence Interpresse\". She even released short-term bonds that promised 8% interest.\n\nNow, French banks and \"Agence Havas\", the rival financial news agency, turned against her. Banks began to investigate the nonexistent companies and soon, there were numerous rumors about Hanau's shady business practices. At first, Hanau managed to quell the rumors by bribing cooperative politicians.\n\nHowever, when charges continued to swirl around her, police arrested Hanau, Bloch and many of their business partners on 17 December 1928. They were charged with fraud and confined in St. Lazare prison. By then, her investors had lost approximately 120,000,000 contemporary French francs.\n\nThe preliminary trial began 15 months later. Hanau protested that the court did not understand financial business, that she could return all the money and that she should be released on bail. When court denied the bail, she went on a hunger strike.\n\nThree weeks later, Hanau was moved to the hôpital Cochin in Paris, where she was forcibly fed. When she was left alone, she made a rope out of bedsheets, climbed out of the window and returned to St. Lazare prison. Police chief Jean Chiappe, a Corsican, was afraid that she would die in his hands and requested for her to be released on bail. She was moved to a hospice, where she still announced that she would return all the money, but not everybody believed her.\n\nHer trial began in earnest on 20 February 1932. During the trial, Hanau revealed the names of all the politicians that she had bribed and caused a scandal. Hanau received two years in prison, but the court credited her with the 15 months she had already spent in prison. Bloch received 18 months, and their other partners were released with fines.\n\nWhen Hanau was released later that year, she bought the \"Forces\" magazine. In April 1932, she published an article about the shady side of the financial markets and quoted a Sûreté file about herself. Police arrested her but she refused to reveal who had leaked the file, just that it had been taken from the Financial Minister Flandin. She was sentenced to 3 months in prison for receiving classified information. She appealed, but when the appeal was rejected, she fled. She was soon arrested and returned to prison.\n\nMarthe Hanau committed suicide on 19 July 1935 by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.\n\nA French movie, \"La Banquière\" (\"The Lady Banker\"), by Francis Girod, was made in 1980, starring Romy Schneider as \"Emma Eckhert\", a thinly fictionalized Hanau.\n\n\n\n"}

The following inning, another of Bagby's teammates, Bill Wambsganss, turned in the first unassisted triple play in World Series history.\n\nIn 1921, it was Bagby's pitch that Babe Ruth hit as his record-breaking 120th home run.\n\nBefore the 1923 season Bagby was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He retired at the end of the season.\n\nIn a nine-season career, Bagby posted a 127–89 record with 450 strikeouts and a 3.11 ERA in 1821.2 innings pitched. In World Series play, he had a 1–1 record with an ERA of 1.80.\n\nBagby was a good hitting pitcher in the majors, posting a .218 batting average (144-for-660) with 69 runs, 35 doubles, 6 triples, 2 home runs, 60 RBI and drawing 32 bases on balls.\n\nBaseball historians Bill James and Rob Neyer have ranked Bagby's screwball the ninth-best of all time.\n\nHis son, Jim Bagby Jr., was also a major leaguer who played for the Red Sox, Indians and Pirates. The Bagbys became the first father and son to pitch in the World Series when Jim Jr. appeared for the 1946 Red Sox.\n\nJim Bagby died in Marietta, Georgia at age 64. He was survived by his son Jim Jr. and two daughters, Mabel Moore and Elizabeth (Betty) Fincher.\n\n\n, or Baseball Library profile and chronology, SABR Biography Project article, or Retrosheet, or Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, or The Deadball Era\n"}

{"id": "2142653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142653", "title": "Crankcase", "text": "Crankcase\n\nA crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft in a reciprocating internal combustion engine. In most modern engines, the crankcase is integrated into the engine block. \n\nTwo-stroke engines typically use a crankcase-compression design, resulting in the fuel/air mixture passing through the crankcase before entering the cylinder(s). This design of the engine does not include an oil sump in the crankcase.\n\nFour-stroke engines typically have an oil sump at the bottom of the crankcase and the majority of the engine's oil is held within the crankcase. The fuel/air mixture does not pass through the crankcase in a four-stroke engine, however a small amount of exhaust gasses often enter as \"blow-by\" from the combustion chamber.\n\nThe crankcase often forms the lower half of the main bearing journals (with the bearing caps forming the other half), although in some engines the crankcase completely surrounds the main bearing journals.\n\nAn \"open-crank\" engine has no crankcase. This design was used in early engines and remains in use in some large diesel engines, such as used in ships.\n\nMany two-stroke engines use a crankcase-compression design, where a partial vacuum draws the fuel/air mixture into the engine as the piston moves upwards. Then as the piston travels downward, the inlet port is uncovered and the compressed fuel/air mixture is pushed from the crankcase into the combustion chamber. \n\nCrankcase-compression designs are often used in small petrol (gasoline) engines for motorcycles, generator sets and garden equipment. This design has also been used in some small diesel engines, however it is less common.\n\nBoth sides of the piston are used as working surfaces: the upper side is the power piston, the lower side acts as a pump. Therefore an inlet valve is not required. Unlike other types of engines, there is no supply of oil to the crankcase, because it handles the fuel/air mixture. Instead, two-stroke oil is mixed with the fuel used by the engine and burned in the combustion chamber.\n\nLarge two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression, but instead a separate scavenge blower or supercharger to draw the fuel/air mixture into the compression chamber. Therefore the crankcases are similar to a four-stroke engine in that they are solely used for lubrication purposes.\n\nMost four-stroke engines use a crankcase that contains the engine's lubricating oil, as either a wet sump system or the less common dry sump system. Unlike a two-stroke (crankcase-compression) engine, the crankcase in a four-stroke engine is not used for the fuel/air mixture.\n\nEngine oil is recirculated around a four-stroke engine (rather than burning it as happens in a two-stroke engine) and much of this occurs within the crankcase. Oil is stored either at the bottom of the crankcase (in a wet sump engine) or in a separate reservoir (in a dry sump system). From here the oil is pressurized by an oil pump (and usually passes through an oil filter) before it is squirted into the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and onto the cylinder walls, and eventually drips off into the bottom of the crankcase.\n\nEven in a wet sump system, the crankshaft has minimal contact with the sump oil. Otherwise, the high-speed rotation of the crankshaft would cause the oil to froth, making it difficult for the oil pump to move the oil, which can starve the engine of lubrication. Oil from the sump may splash onto the crankshaft due to g-forces or bumpy roads, which is referred to as windage.\n\nAlthough the piston rings are intended to seal the combustion chamber from the crankcase, it is normal for some combustion gases to escape around the piston rings and enter the crankcase. This phenomenon is known as \"blow-by\". If these gases accumulated within the crankcase, it would cause unwanted pressurisation of the crankcase, contamination of the oil and rust from condensation. To prevent this, modern engines use a \"crankcase ventilation system\" to expel the combustion gases from the crankcase. In most cases, the gases are passed through to the intake manifold.\n\nEarly engines were of the \"open-crank\" style, that is, there was no enclosed crankcase. The crankshaft and associated parts were open to the environment. This made for a messy environment, as oil spray from the moving parts was not contained. Another disadvantage was that dirt and dust could get on moving engine parts, causing excessive wear and possible malfunction of the engine. Frequent cleaning of the engine was required to keep it in normal working order.\n\nSome two-stroke diesel engines, such as the large slow-speed engines used in ships, have the crankcase as a separate space from the cylinders, or as an open crank. The spaces between the crosshead piston and the crankshaft, may be largely open for maintenance access.\n"}

The USN versions which were later reclassified Landing Ship Support, Large also performed radar picket duty and fire fighting.\n\nThe original designation for the ships was LCS(L)(3), which stood for \"Landing Craft Support (Large) Mark 3\". In 1949 the class was reclassified to \"Landing Ship Support, Large\" (LSSL). The United States Navy had to have the designation LCS(L) because there was also a smaller class named LCL, that were built mainly for rescue and smoke laying during amphibious operation.\n\nA total of 130 were made. Three different ship building yards did the construction: George Lawley & Son (Neponset, Massachusetts); Commercial Iron Works (Portland, Oregon); and Albina Engine Works (Portland, Oregon).\n\nThe hull was the same as the Landing Craft Infantry ships. They were long, displaced , wide and drew when fully loaded. The flat bottom and skegs between and on either side of the twin screws allowed the ships to safely beach. The anchor is at the stern of the ship so it can be used to help pull the ship off the beach if necessary. The twin variable pitch screws were each driven by a bank of four Grey Marine (later General Motors) diesel engines, with a total power for all eight engines of . These engines gave a maximum speed of , but normally the ships sailed at . The ships had a range of . Armour for the gun mounts, pilot house and conning tower was provided by STS splinter shields. The ships had a smoke generator which was used to obscure landing craft approaching the beach.\n\nLCS(L) vessels could be produced in as little as 10 days, and final fitting out would take a further few weeks. The ships also made very good fire fighting ships. A fire fighting manifold was fitted in front of the bow gun and two monitors with pumps fitted just forward of the aft gun.\n\nThe LCS(L)(3) ships provided more firepower per ton than any ship ever built for the USN. Three guns and ten rocket launchers were the main armaments. The bow gun was a 3\"/50 caliber gun, a single 40 mm gun or a twin 40 mm gun. The forward and aft deck guns were twin 40 mm gun. The ten mark 7 rocket launchers were situated behind the bow gun and forward deck house. Four 20 mm cannons were also mounted and other arms stowed inside. The rifle locker held 4 M1 carbines, 4 Thompson sub machine guns, and 1911A1 45cal semi auto pistols.\n\nThe Battle of Tarawa showed a gap in Navy resources for close in support of landing troops. The time interval between the end of shelling from the large ships and the arrival of the landing craft on the beach allowed the defenders to regroup. The Landing Craft Support was designed to fill this void.\n\nThe first Landing Craft Support ships arrived in the Pacific Theater in time for the landings at Iwo Jima.\n\nAfter providing close in support during the landings at Okinawa, many Landing Craft Support ships were placed on the radar picket stations as anti-aircraft platforms. When not on a picket stations, the ship would create smoke to hide the fleet at anchor and perform \"skunk patrol\" screening for suicide boats.\n\nIn the Borneo Campaign, Landing Craft Support was used in landings in Tarakan and Balikpapan.\n\nDuring World War II, five LCS(L)(3)s were sunk in combat (see below) and 21 were damaged. Three of these small warships received Presidential Unit Citations, while six were awarded Navy Unit citations. Importantly, Lieutenant Richard M. McCool, skipper of USS \"LCS(L)(3) 122\", was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n\"LCS(L)(3)-7\", \"LCS(L)(3)-26\" and \"LCS(L)(3)-49\" were sunk by suicide boats off Mariveles, Corregidor Channel, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on 16 February 1945. \"LCS(L)(3)-15\" was sunk by kamikaze aircraft off Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, on 22 April 1945. \"LCS(L)(3)-33\" was sunk by shore batteries off Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, on 19 February 1945.\n\nAt the end of the war, surviving ships returned to the United States. Some were restored to action for the Korean War. Many were transferred to Japan, France (and on to South Vietnam), Cambodia, Thailand, Greece, and other nations.\n\nOnly two ships are known to still exist. One has been highly modified as a fishing boat. The second was in Thailand and was kept in very similar configuration to its original (HTMS \"Nakha\", formerly USS \"LCS(L)-102)\". The National Association of USS LCS(L) 1–130 was successful in having HTMS \"Nakha\" transferred to the association for public display in the United States. She was officially released from the Royal Thai Navy on November 10, 2007 after being returned to the US in September of that year. As of May 2017 USS LCS(L)-102 is under restoration and upkeep. It is open to the public on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays or by special arrangements, and tours at the former Naval Ship yard, Mare Island, in Vallejo, California.\n\nThe British designed, built and operated ten Fairmile Type H LCS vessels. Three of these were sunk in action.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2142673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142673", "title": "Indigofera", "text": "Indigofera\n\nIndigofera is a large genus of over 750 species of flowering plants belonging to the pea family Fabaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world.\n\nSpecies of \"Indigofera\" are mostly shrubs, though some are small trees or herbaceous perennials or annuals. Most have pinnate leaves. Racemes of flowers grow in the leaf axils, in hues of red, but there are a few white- and yellow-flowered species. The fruit is a legume pod of varying size and shape.\n\n\"Indigofera\" is a varied genus that has shown unique characteristics making it an interesting candidate as a potential perennial crop. Specifically, there is diverse variation among species with a number of unique characteristics. Some examples of this diversity include differences in pericarp thickness, fruit type, and flowering morphology. The unique characteristics it has displayed include potential for mixed smallholder systems with at least one other species and a resilience that allows for constant nitrogen update despite varying conditions.\n\nOne example of its unique flowering morphology is an open carpel not often seen elsewhere. In addition, it appears that the organ primordial is often formed at deeper layers than other eudicots. This variety could have significant implications on its role in an actual perennial polyculture. For example, different flowering morphologies could be artificially selected for in varying directions in order to better fit in different environmental conditions and with different populations of other plants.\n\nThe types of fruit produced by different species of \"Indigofera\" can also be divided into broad categories that again show great variation. The three basic types of fruit categories can be separated by their curvature including straight, slightly curved, and falcate (sickle-shaped). In addition, several of the species including \"Indigofera microcarpa\", \"Indigofera suffruticosa\", and \"Indigofera enneaphylla\" have shown delayed dehiscence (maturing) of fruits This variation could again allow for artificial selection of the most abundant and nutritious fruit types and shapes.\n\nAnother way to categorize \"Indigofera\" is by its pericarp thickness. The pericarp (the tissue from the ovary that surrounds the seeds) can be categorized as type I, type II, and type III with type I having the thinnest pericarp and fewest layers of schlerenchymatous (stiff) tissue and type III having the thickest pericarp and most schlerenchymatous layers. Despite the previous examples of delayed dehiscence, most fruits of this genus show normal explosive dehiscence to disperse seeds. Similar to fruit shape, the variation in fruit sizes allows for the thickest and most bountiful fruits to be selected.\n\nSeveral species, especially \"Indigofera tinctoria\" and \"Indigofera suffruticosa\", are used to produce the dye indigo. Scraps of Indigo-dyed fabric likely dyed with plants from the genus \"Indigofera\" discovered at Huaca Prieta predate Egyptian indigo-dyed fabrics by more than 1,500 years. Colonial planters in the Caribbean grew indigo and transplanted its cultivation when they settled in the colony of South Carolina and North Carolina where people of the Tuscarora confederacy adopted the dyeing process for head wraps and clothing. Exports of the crop did not expand until the mid-to late 18th century. When Eliza Lucas Pinckney and enslaved Africans successfully cultivated new strains near Charleston it became the second most important cash crop in the colony (after rice) before the American Revolution. It comprised more than one-third of all exports in value.\n\nThe chemical aniline, from which many important dyes are derived, was first synthesized from \"Indigofera suffruticosa\" (syn. \"Indigofera anil\", whence the name aniline).\n\nIn Indonesia, the Sundanese use \"Indigofera tinctoria\" (known locally as or ) as dye for batik. Marco Polo was the first to report on the preparation of indigo in India. Indigo was quite often used in European easel painting during the Middle Ages.\n\nSeveral species of this group are used to alleviate pain. The herbs are generally regarded as an analgesic with anti-inflammatory activity, rather than an anodyne. \"Indigofera articulata\" (\"Khedaish\" in Arabic) was used for toothache, and \"Indigofera oblongifolia\" (\"hasr\" in Arabic) was used as an anti-inflammatory for insect stings, snakebites, and swellings.\n\n\"Indigofera suffruticosa\" and \"Indigofera aspalthoides\" have also been used as anti-inflammatories. A patent was granted for use of \"Indigofera arrecta\" extract to relieve ulcer pain.\n\nThe Maasai people of Kenya use parts of \"Indigofera brevicalyx\" and \"Indigofera swaziensis\" as toothbrushes.\n\n\"Indigofera\" comprises the following species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe status of the following species is unresolved:\n\n\n\n\"Indigofera\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the turnip moth (\"Agrotis segetum\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2142679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142679", "title": "Secret societies in Singapore", "text": "Secret societies in Singapore\n\nSecret societies in Singapore have been largely eradicated as a security issue in the city-state. However many smaller groups remain today which attempt to mimic societies of the past. The membership of these societies is largely adolescent.\n\nDespite fading from contemporary Singaporean society, these secret societies hold great relevance to Singapore's modern history. The founding of the city-state in 1819 saw the arrival of thousands of Chinese, thereby transplanting to Singapore social systems already present in China itself. Although the secret societies were commonly associated with violence, extortion and vice, they also played a part in building a social fabric for early Chinese migrants in Singapore. They were given leeway to control the Chinese populace due to the hands-off policy adopted by the British colonials, who hoped to create stability.\n\nThe secret societies formed in Singapore can be traced to mid-18th century Fujian province in China, with the local offshoots adopting an organisational structure mirroring the parent organisation. The Hongmen, the first secret society to be established in Singapore, traced its origins to the Tiandihui in Fujian.\n\nDespite their founding principles of mutual assistance and bonding, secret societies have, over time, come to conjure up impressions of violence and disorder. This association, perhaps exaggerated, has been encouraged by law enforcement officers since their formation in the colonial era. This perception was strengthened by several factors, including the inability of the colony's administration to control their activities, the branding of arrested society members as \"criminal gangsters\" by the media and an upsurge in violent crime in the 1960s sparked by a few society members. These factors came together during the same period in which the country was trying to gain a foothold fresh from having attained political independence it did not foresee.\n\nSeveral important riots in Malayan history had prompted the colonial government to respond umambiguously. These riots include the Penang Riots of 1867 (which involved the Ghee Hin) and the Post Office Riots of 1876. The Societies Ordinance of 1889 was introduced as an attempt at suppression.\n\nIn the early 19th century, secret societies posed a significant threat to law and order in Singapore. The early Chinese immigrants' clandestine activities and occasional turf wars proved too much of a problem for the British authorities. The British authorities were therefore obliged to curb the growing problem. They employed a number of methods, both on purpose and not, to check the growth of secret societies. This resulted in the decline of secret societies.\n\nThe transfer of authority over Singapore from the Indian Government to the colonial office in London is considered by most to be the most important factor that helped the British authority check the growth of secret societies. Elevation of Singapore to a Crown Colony meant that London was willing to spend money and resources, and provide proper administrators that it had been unprepared to do. Thus, Singapore was given a significantly larger priority and only with the transfer of power, could the authorities initiate the following changes.\n\nThe legislation of strict laws had an enormous effect in checking the growth of the secret societies. Two significant laws were passed in the 1860s.\n\nThe first was the Peace Preservation Act (also known as the banishment act) of 1867, which gave the colonial government the power to detain and deport Chinese immigrants who were convicted of crime. This was a major weapon against the secret societies members as it created fear and deterred the immigrants from joining the secret societies. With this law, the power of the secret societies was significantly curtailed.\n\nIn 1869, the Peace Preservation Act was amended, and the Dangerous Societies Suppression Ordinance was also enacted. This required that secret societies be registered. By requiring only the societies, and not the individual members, to be registered, the police attracted people to go to provide insight on the actual strength of the societies. 10 societies, 618 office bearers and 12371 members were registered in the first round of registrations. This ordinance also accorded the colonial government the power to inspect any society that was deemed dangerous to public peace. This way the colonial government could monitor the activities of the secret societies closely. This prevented the Chinese immigrants from joining the secret societies, causing it to reduce in influence in Singapore in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1843, there were only 133 police personnel. Even if the army of 595 men was brought in, they were still no match for the Chinese community consisting of 32 132 people (most of whom were secret society members). Thomas Dunman, the first Commissioner of Police, wrote that his police force was underpaid and drew salaries lower than the average coolies. By 1865, there were 385 policemen to 50 043 Chinese, but the ratio of policemen to Chinese was still too few to be effective. This was compounded by the fact that no one in the police force was qualified to deal with the Chinese. The officers' posts were held by Europeans while Indians made up the rank and file. No Chinese were employed because of their possible dealings with secret societies. Thus, the police force was ignorant of the language and ways of the Chinese, which was also the most volatile community. So ineffective was the police force that the wealthy had to hire private watchmen and carry personal arms to ensure their own safety.\n\nHowever, after Singapore became a Crown Colony, large improvements made to the local police force. This was an important factor that helped check the growth of secret societies. The police force started to receive more funding, better equipment and proper training. All these made the police force a much more effective force than it had been under the East India Company. Even more significant was the hiring of Chinese police officers who could understand and deal with the problems associated with the secret societies.\n\nThe establishment of the Chinese Protectorate is yet another factor that led to the societies' growth being checked. The first Chinese Protector, William Pickering, maintained close contact with the Chinese immigrant community and provided them with assistance. Being fluent in written and spoken Mandarin as well as in other varieties of Chinese, Pickering looked after the welfare of the newly arrived coolies, prevented coolie abuse and kept track of the numbers of coolies leaving and arriving. Pickering also licensed coolie depots. To qualify for a licence, the depots required a constant and plentiful supply of water and good ventilation. He also visited the coolies to ask them in person what their connections in Singapore were, making sure they had someone to turn to during their stay.\n\nThis establishment of the Chinese Protectorate let the British sustain, for the first time in history, a satisfactory relationship with the Chinese community. Pickering was known affectionately as daren (大人), Chinese for 'Sir'. The Protectorate effectively became a legitimate alternative where migrants could come and try solve their problems, instead of putting it forward to the societies for a normally violent conclusion. It thus helped to deter many new immigrants from increasing the membership of secret societies.\n\n\n"}

John and James founded the production companies Romulus Films and Remus Films, which were active during the 1950s and 1960s, and the distribution company Independent Film Distributors (known as IFD), which was active 1950–59 and handled the UK distribution of films such as \"The African Queen\" and \"Gift Horse\", as well as several films made by their two production companies (such as \"Room at the Top\").\n\nJohn and James Woolf were the sons of the British producer C. M. Woolf (1879–1942), who was co-producer with Michael Balcon of two early Alfred Hitchcock films, \"Downhill\" (1927) and \"Easy Virtue\" (1928). Woolf senior, was a major figure at Gaumont British, and established General Film Distributors in 1937.\n\nJohn and James were educated at Eton, while the older brother also attended Institut Montana, Switzerland. John was the sales manager of General Film Distributors until it was taken over by the Rank Organisation James worked for Columbia Pictures in the Hollywood publicity department. John Woolf served in World War II and was demobilised with the rank of major.\n\nTheir father died in 1942 and J. Arthur Rank became director of General Film Distributors and John returned from the Army as joint managing director. However, neither John or James enjoyed working for a large corporation. In 1948, they went to S.G. Warburg for financial backing for two new companies, Independent Film Distributors, and a production arm, Romulus Films. According to critic Ronald Bergan, \"Their aims were ambitious: to produce artistically valuable and yet commercially viable films, whose subjects would be wider than the Little Englanderism of British pictures of the period, and featuring big stars.\" An obituarist of James Woolf stated that John \"was the main financial brain and James primarily in charge of artistic policy.\"\n\nThe first Romulus release was \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" (1951) with James Mason and Ava Gardner. The American director-producer Albert Lewin had begun to prepare the film for MGM, but the studio had cancelled the project, James Woolf discovered on a Hollywood visit, because of Lewin's problems with the House Un-American Activities Committee. According to John, this resulted in the Woolf's concentration on developing transatlantic projects. Their mentor, Alexander Korda, advised against half-financing \"The African Queen\" (1951): \"Two old people going up and down an African river . . . who's going to be interested in that? You'll be bankrupt!\". Korda was proved wrong. From this John Huston film they gained international critical and financial success. Two further films directed by Huston followed, \"Moulin Rouge\" (1952) and \"Beat the Devil\" (1953), but were less successful.\n\nRomulus became one of the most significant English production companies of the time. They made several films with producer Daniel Angel and helped turn Laurence Harvey, who they had under contract, into a star. In the mid-50s they formed a partnership with Korda, helping him to finance his films including \"Richard III\" (1955). By 1959, they estimated their movies had earned more than £3million overseas. John Woolf became interested in \"Room at the Top\" after seeing an interview conducted by Woodrow Wyatt with the novel's author John Braine on \"Panorama\" on 8 April 1957. He bought a copy of the book the next day, and quickly purchased the film rights.\n\nIndividually, John was instrumental in the formation of Anglia Television in 1958 and James wrote novels.\n\nIn 1963, the Woolf brothers ran into trouble from the film distributors Defence Organisation due to their refusal to withhold the rights to their old cinema films from the sale to television and there was some talk that their new films would be boycotted by British cinemas. This did not happen.\n\nBy now the brothers were working separately. James went to Hollywood to produce \"King Rat\". Shortly afterwards he was staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel when he failed to keep a dinner arrangement with director Lewis Gilbert about making a film version of the musical \"Oliver!\". A hotel employee found him dead, sitting up in bed with an open book on his lap; the cause was reported to be a heart attack. He was 46 years old. Bryan Forbes later claimed the heart attack was brought on by an accidental overdose of painkillers. Gilbert had to pull out of the \"Oliver!\" project shortly before filming began because of his Paramount contract and John Woolf remembered \"The Fallen Idol\" (1948) which suggested to him that its director, Sir Carol Reed, had the requisite skills to work with children.\n\nJohn continued his career as a producer. In 1968 he bought British and American Film Holdings from Minster Trust. That year he produced his first film on his own, \"Oliver!\", which ended up winning the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nJohn Woolf was knighted in 1975 and remained a director of Anglia Television until 1983. In 1982 he joined Bernard Delfont and Max Rayne to form First Leisure Corporation, of which he was a director. He was also a trustee of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.\n\nJames was gay and was rumoured to be a lover of Laurence Harvey.\n\nJohn Woolf was married three times. His second wife was the actress Edana Romney. His third wife, Ann, was the daughter of director Victor Saville. She survived him. In 1999, the year of his death, John Woolf was estimated to be worth £40 million, through a combination of his films and shrewd investments.\n\nIn the late 1940s the brothers' uncle, Maurice Woolf, left £130,000 to a showgirl, Prudence Wise. John Woolf challenged the will, and settled out of court.\n\nSir John Woolf's son, Jonathan Woolf, revived Romulus Films as of 1999, producing the film \"Revelation\" (2001).\n\nIn 2013, Romulus Films, Ltd. changed directions from film production to regenerative medicine, being involved in a $5 million stock and warrant purchase funding arrangement with BioTime Inc.\nIn 1971, film critic Alexander Walker wrote about James Woolf:\n[He] was a rarity in British films at the time, and would still be so if he was alive today: a man of taste and judgement who loved craftsmanship and supported a director instead of suffocating him or using him as a surrogate talent for the film he himself would have liked to direct had he dared... He was an obsessional filmmaker, loving the wheeling and dealing, relishing the juggling with human talents that it involved, and taking pleasure in spotting youthful proteges and promoting their careers, thereby gaining a vicarious satisfaction from their success that was lacking in his own basically lonely nature.\nFilmmaker Bryan Forbes concurred:\nHe was a midwife for talent and smacked many of us into life... He had a quick mind that panned and found the nuggets before other prospectors on the trail had even arrived at the mine... Jimmy was a shield, quite fearless when tackling the front offices. He knew everybody and he was rich enough in his own right not to have to depend on the largesse of others when it came to getting a project off the ground. He had taste: taste in actors, taste in subject matter... There was a sadness about him at times because he had demons to fight, and in the end he died alone.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2142702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142702", "title": "Banded lapwing", "text": "Banded lapwing\n\nThe banded lapwing (\"Vanellus tricolor\") is a small to medium-sized shorebird, found in small parties or large flocks on bare ground in open grasslands, agricultural land and open savannah. It is native to Australia and in the past considered as a game bird for hunting. Population estimate is 25 000 - 1 000 000. Other names include banded, black-breasted, brown flock and plain plover.\n\nLapwings belong to the family Charadriidae (plovers) and sub-family Vanellinae. Biochemical evidence suggests that plovers are holophyletic, meaning that all modern plovers, and no other taxa, share the same common ancestor. It has been suggested that most plovers originated from the Southern Hemisphere and evolved under arid and semi-arid conditions.\n\nThere are 25 extant species of lapwings. Africa has the most species of lapwings, while North America has none. Australia has two native species, the masked lapwing and the banded lapwing. The masked lapwing is split into \"Vanellus miles miles\" and \"Vanellus miles novaehollandiae\". The first fossils of the \"Vanellus\" species were from Belgian deposits retrieved from the middle Oligocene dating back 30 million years ago, the time when the first grasses appeared.\n\nThe banded lapwing is a medium-sized shorebird with short dark purplish legs and a dull red tibia. They range from 25 cm to 29 cm in length and weigh on average 190 grams. They have an upright stance and a slow walk, breaking into a faster trot when alarmed. The bill is a pale yellow with a black tip and a small red wattle lies at the base. The red wattle and wing spurs are more prominent in males than females. Banded lapwings are characterised by a black cap, a white throat and underparts, white eye stripes and a black breast band extending up each side of its neck to its face. The irises are bright yellow. They fly quick, clipped wing beats, giving them the name 'lapwing'. The young range from 22 cm to 25.5 cm in length and weigh between 124-133 grams. Juvenile plumage is similar to that of the adults, however the crown, nape, sides of neck and breast is mottled dark brown and the feathers of the upper parts are tan.\n\nBanded lapwings are endemic to Australia and found throughout the mainland and Tasmania. They are rarely found in northern Australia and are uncommon in most coastal areas and they are not dependent on wetlands and may live far away from water. Banded lapwings prefer open plains and short grassland areas such as heavily grazed paddocks, agricultural lands and recently germinated cereal crops most commonly found inland and pastures of coastal and inland regions. It avoids \"Acacia\" scrub areas, except where these have become more open due to overgrazing. The species has probably benefited from the clearing of forest and woodlands in southern Australia for agriculture. Outside the breeding season, banded lapwings gather in small flocks and are nomadic. Its movements from one area to another is influenced by seasonal conditions. Records from the \"Atlas of Victorian Birds\" state the banded lapwing is most frequently reported in Victoria during Spring and Winter suggesting that in Victoria they breed when rainfall is highest.\n\nAll plovers are obligate feeders and routinely forage during the day and at night. They prefer areas with very short grass to feed on seeds, insects including worms, ants, termites, beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets and caterpillars.\n\nThe movement of the banded lapwing whilst breeding is almost exclusively inland and away from wetlands banded lapwings are monogamous and breeds usually once a year throughout its normal distribution range. The breeding season is from June to November however, they may nest any month in dry inland areas following rain. It will usually nest in an open area well away from trees or scrub where the sitting bird has a wide uninterrupted view of its surroundings. Nests are a scrape or depression on the ground usually lined up with vegetation and sometimes small stones, twigs or animal droppings. The incubation period is 26 to 28 days and the care for the young is biparental. The eggs and chicks are well camouflaged. Eggs are usually in a clutch size of three to four eggs, light brown with brown and blackish-brown splotches all over the shell. Eggs are approximately 42 mm x 32 mm and pear shaped. During breeding season they are aggressive defending their territory and attacking any predator that comes close to the nests. The wing spurs are used in combat. Chicks will freeze up and remain quite still at sign of danger. Parents will distract intruders often by distraction displays and aggression. They lure the intruder away or protesting loudly, making loud swoops at the observer. They have a loud strident 'kew-kew-kew' call when alarmed or a descending 'er-chill-char, er-chill char' sound. The young can fly between three and four weeks. Reasons for nesting failure include trampling by stock, destruction of nests by vehicles and excessive human disturbance.\n\nConservation of banded lapwings will be dependent on appropriate management of farm and pastoral lands as it exploits a variety of open habitats and agricultural land however, there are no immediate or serious threats to its future survival.\n\n"}

Although credited to the whole band, it was largely written by their drummer Roger Taylor, and is the eighth track on the band's 1991 album \"Innuendo\".\n\nThe song was released as a single in the United States on Freddie Mercury's 45th birthday, 5 September 1991, and as double A-side single in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 9 December, in the wake of Mercury's death, with the Queen track \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The double A-side debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for five weeks, topped the Irish Singles Chart for six weeks, and reached number 16 in Germany. \"These Are the Days\" by itself topped Poland's LP3 chart for fourteen non-consecutive weeks. The song was awarded a Brit Award for British Single of the Year in 1992.\n\nRon Hart of \"Rolling Stone\" writes, \"the conga-driven synth ballad \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" is \"Innuendo\"‘s most significant single, given that it was released on Mercury's 45th birthday, and that its video marked the last time his fans were able to see the singer alive, as it was filmed in May of ’91 during the final stages of his battle with AIDS. A ballad in the vein of \"Love of My Life,\" it was a song that carried a significant amount of weight given the frailty of Mercury's appearance in the black-and-white video, later compounded when unreleased color footage from the filming emerged in \"Days of Our Lives\".\"\n\nThe song was first played live on 20 April 1992 at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, sung by George Michael and Lisa Stansfield. This live version was included on the 1993 album \"Five Live (EP)\", credited to 'George Michael with Queen & Lisa Stansfield'.\n\nThe song was played on the 2005/2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers tours with vocals provided by Roger Taylor. On stage the song was accompanied by a video of the band in their early days in Japan, including many shots focusing on past band members Freddie Mercury and John Deacon.\n\nThe song was used on 1 July 2007 at the Concert for Diana held at the new Wembley Stadium, London in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died almost 10 years earlier. At the end of the concert, a video montage of Diana as a child was presented and this song was playing in the background.\n\nA cover version by Petula Clark is included on her 2008 compilation album \"\".\n\nThe video was the last Queen video to feature Freddie Mercury in person. Rudi Dolezal and Hannes Rossacher of DoRo Productions filmed the footage used in the video on 30 May 1991.\n\nFreddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and John Deacon were present at the shoot; Brian May was filmed later in the year and added in digitally, as he was out of the country on a promotional tour at the time of the shoot. Following rumours about Mercury's health, the video was filmed and released in black and white to hide the full extent of his illness.\n\nIn the video, Mercury wears a waistcoat with pictures of cats that was made for him by Queen costume designer Diana Moseley. With his knowing farewell look straight at the camera, Mercury whispers \"I still love you\" as the song ends, which are his last ever words on camera.\n\nThe US version of the video features animation produced by Walt Disney Studios, as Queen's North American record label, Hollywood Records, is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.

The film received highly negative reviews and was a box office bomb, grossing only $22.7 million against its $44 million budget. Moore won a joint Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for both her performance in this film and in \"Striptease\".\n\nAnnie Laird (Demi Moore) is a sculptor who lives in New York with her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); she works a day job as a data entry clerk. Annie is selected to be a juror in the trial of mob boss Louie Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco), who is accused of ordering the murder of Salvatore Riggio.\n\nMark Cordell (Alec Baldwin) buys some of Annie's artwork and then wines and dines her before she discovers he is better known as \"The Teacher\", Boffano's enforcer and the actual perpetrator of Riggio's murder.

It was completed in 1921 using sketches first started in 1913.\n\nProkofiev began his work on the concerto as early as 1913 when he wrote a theme with variations which he then set aside. Although he revisited the sketches in 1916–17, he did not fully devote himself to the project until 1921 when he was spending the summer in Brittany.\n\nProkofiev himself played the solo part at the premiere on 16 December 1921 in Chicago with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Frederick Stock. The work did not gain immediate popularity and had to wait until 1922 to be confirmed in the 20th century canon, after Serge Koussevitzky conducted a lavishly praised performance in Paris. The first Soviet performance was on 22 March 1925, by Samuil Feinberg, with the Orchestra of the Theatre of the Revolution under Konstantin Saradzhev.\n\nThe concerto is scored for solo piano and orchestra with the following instrumentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concerto consists of three movements of roughly equal length which last just under 30 minutes in total.\n\nOf the five piano concertos written by Prokofiev, the third piano concerto has garnered the greatest popularity and critical acclaim. The concerto radiates a crisp vitality that testifies to Prokofiev's inventive prowess in punctuating lyrical passages with witty dissonances, while maintaining a balanced partnership between the soloist and orchestra. Unlike the examples of piano concertos set by many of Prokofiev's Romantic forebears, the orchestra rises above subsidiary accompaniment to play a very active part in this work.\n\nThe first movement opens with an \"andante\" clarinet solo, a long, lyrical melody that the whole orchestra eventually picks up and expands. The strings begin the \"allegro\" section with a scalar passage which seems to accelerate towards an upwards glissando climax, at which point the \"allegro\" entry of the solo piano unexpectedly breaks the lyrical mood in an exuberant, harmonically fluid burst of brilliance and rhythm, utilizing fragments of the first theme. Piano and orchestra continue in dialogue until the piano introduces the harmonic structure for the second theme with a loud, unexpected march-like climax.\n\nThe second theme, considerably more dissonant and ambiguous in tonality, is first taken by the orchestra, then expanded upon by the soloist. This leads into what is perhaps the most recognizable pianistic feat of the first movement: several lines of octaves interspersed with close tones either above or below (in a triplet rhythm), moving up and down the keyboard with the hands usually on top of one another. This is followed by a restatement of the opening clarinet theme, played loudly in the full orchestra, which transitions to a haunting variation of the theme by the solo piano. A quick, scalar passage from the movement's beginning is now taken up by the piano, in what is arguably the most difficult passage in the first movement for its challenges of fingering and phrasing.\n\nThis leads into an exact recapitulation of the piano's entrance, which now leads into a brilliant coda involving various figurations of the octave-triplet idea, as well as runs on the piano consisting entirely of ascending parallel triads and glissandi. The second theme is restated in the high register of the piano, first as blocked chords, then as frenetic sixteenth-note arpeggios. Several non-melodic scales allow the music to wind down to a quiet throb in the orchestra on a dissonant chord, C-A♭-D. The orchestra then resumes the pulsating low Cs; the piano makes a shortened restatement of the scalar passage that led to the recapitulation, which is now used to end the movement, with a dissonant harmony followed sarcastically by barely tonal open C octaves.\n\nThe middle movement (in E minor) is a theme and five variations and is a dazzling example of Prokofiev expressing his slightly sarcastic wit in musical terms. \n\nThe third movement, which Prokofiev himself called an \"argument\" between soloist and orchestra, begins with an A-minor statement of the main theme in bassoons and pizzicato strings, interrupted by the piano's assertive entrance with a conflicting theme. Interplay between the piano and orchestra builds up steam, with a brief quickening of tempo (foreshadowing the lengthy Coda) before arriving at a slow, lyrical secondary theme (C♯ major/minor) in woodwinds. The piano offers a rather sarcastic reply, and the slow theme develops, through another Rachmaninoff-esque restatement and another ethereal exploration (the soloist running up and down the keyboard softly over gently dissonant muted woodwinds), into a united climax with piano and strings in unison, then fading into the Coda.\n\nThis is the most virtuosic section of the concerto, with an allegro restatement of the main theme, again in bassoons, but in E minor. The piano reframes it initially in D major, then slides into a bitonal obbligato against a G major underpinning in strings. Then the coda explodes into a musical battle between soloist and orchestra, with prominent piano ornamentation over the orchestra (including famously difficult double-note arpeggi, sometimes approximated by pianists with keyboard glissandos using the knuckles), eventually establishing the ending key of C major and finishing in a flourish with a fortissimo C tonic ninth chord.\n\nProkofiev himself made the first recording of the Piano Concerto No. 3 in June 1932 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Piero Coppola. The recording was made at Abbey Road Studios in London and is the only recording that exists of Prokofiev performing one of his own piano concertos. Martha Argerich recorded this concerto with Claudio Abbado in the late 1960s in a famous disc for Deutsche Grammophon. She also received a Grammy Award for her performance of this concerto in 2000 with Charles Dutoit. Evgeny Kissin and Vladimir Ashkenazy have made a Grammy Award-winning recording of this work along with Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor with the Philharmonia Orchestra. In 2009, Horacio Gutiérrez’s 1990 recording with Neeme Järvi and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, was reissued, as \"Prokofiev: The Concertos\", receiving notable acclaim. Recently, the 1998 recording by Alexander Toradze, with the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra and Valery Gergiev, was named \"Historically the Best On Record\" in a survey of over 70 recordings by the International Piano Quarterly. Other notable recordings have been made by Julius Katchen, Lang Lang, Nikolai Lugansky, Van Cliburn, Mikhail Pletnev, Yefim Bronfman, and Behzod Abduraimov, among others.\n\n"}

Lee before it was reincorporated.\n\nBorn in South Carolina, he showed little early interest in politics, and his early career included the study of law and a tenure as a mathematics professor at the Charleston College from 1843 to 1855. In the late 1840s, as sectional issues roiled South Carolina politics, Miles began to speak up on sectional issues. He opposed both the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850. From then on, Miles would look at any northern efforts to restrict slavery as justification for secession.\n\nMiles was elected as mayor of Charleston in 1855 and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1857 until South Carolina seceded, in December 1860. He was a member of the state secession convention and a representative from South Carolina at the Confederate Convention in Montgomery, Alabama, which established the provisional government and constitution for the Confederate States. He represented his state in the Confederate House of Representatives during the American Civil War.\n\nMiles was born in Walterboro, South Carolina to James Saunders Miles and Sarah Bond Worley Miles. His ancestors were French Huguenots and his grandfather, Major Felix Warley, fought in the American Revolution. His primary education came at Southworth School and he later attended Willington Academy where John C. Calhoun had matriculated a generation earlier. Miles enrolled at Charleston College in 1838 where he met future secession advocates James De Bow and William Henry Trescot. Miles graduated in 1842 and in 1843 he briefly studied law with a local attorney before returning to his alma mater as a mathematics professor.\n\nThroughout the 1840s Miles showed little interest in active politics. He did not participate in the Bluffton Movement in 1844, although he did recognize that the 1846 Wilmot Proviso threatened his concepts of \"southern rights, the equality of the states under the Constitution, and the honor of a slaveholding people.\" In 1849 Miles was invited to speak at a Fourth of July celebration in Charleston.\n\nIn this speech, Miles attacked the principles behind the Wilmot Proviso. While he believed that slavery was a \"Divine institution,\" he was willing to accept differences of opinion as long as antislavery advocates returned the favor by admitting that slavery was \"recognized and countenanced\" by the Constitution. To Miles, Northerners, in their efforts to legislate restrictions on slavery, were not simply raising an issue of constitutional interpretation. Miles argued:\n\nMiles rejected any compromise on slavery and supported Calhoun in opposition to the Compromise of 1850. However while activists within the state in 1850 and 1851 mobilized, Miles remained on the sidelines as Southern Rights associations and rallies dominated South Carolina politics. In 1852 Miles delivered an address to the Alumni Society of the Charleston College that included one of the frequent arguments of the Fire-Eaters. Addressing himself to the Declaration of Independence, Miles denied the concept of inalienable rights and maintained that liberty was an \"Acquired Privilege.\" He argued that \"Men are born neither Free nor Equal\" and some men were born with the innate ability to earn liberty while others were not. Government should not attempt to either \"make a Statesman of him who God intended should be a Ploughman\" or \"bind down forever to the plough him to whom God has given a mind capable of shaping the destinies of a People.\" From this point on in his career, Miles rejected the political legitimacy of abolitionists and free-soilers and responded to any attempts to restrict slavery with a call for secession. In 1852 he delivered \"Republican Government Not Always the Best\" to members of College of Charleston graduation address.\n\nIn the summer of 1855 a yellow fever epidemic hit the coast of Virginia. Eventually 2,000 people would die as well as half of the doctors who attempted to treat it. Virginia called for volunteers from the lower South where the disease was more common and residents had developed some natural immunity. Miles responded by serving for several weeks in Norfolk as a nurse. His heroic activities were reported back to Charleston, and his friends used the popularity generated by his activities to draft him as a candidate for mayor. Upon his return to Charleston he made only one public speech but was still elected mayor by a vote of 1,260 to 837. While serving as mayor, Miles lived at 53 Beaufain Street; the house no longer exists.\n\nInterested in reform, the new mayor first tackled police reform. After sending out fact finding missions to other cities, he implemented a plan that addressed the problem of excessive partisanship within the city council. Appointment responsibility was reassigned to the police chief for lower ranks and to the mayor, with city council approval, for higher ranks. He expanded patrols, cracked down on habitual offenders.\n\nIn the area of social reform, Miles created a house of corrections for juveniles, an almshouse, an orphanage and an asylum. He provided aid for transient poor and free black paupers and implemented a sewage system as a health measure. Having inherited a large public debt, he increased property taxes in an effort to retire the debt in 35 years. At the end of his two-year term he was widely judged to have been successful, leading him to consider further public office.\n\nIn 1856 Miles ran for the seat being vacated by Congressman William Aiken Jr.. The national issues of slavery in Kansas and the rise of the Republican Party dominated the election. Miles argued that the election of the Republican candidate for president, John C. Fremont, would require a joint southern response that could include boycotting the new Congress and calling a southern convention to determine further action. In a three-way election Miles was victorious by a vote of 1,852 to 1,844 for his two opponents.\n\nWhen he took office in 1857 he found that the Kansas issues dominated Congressional debate, threatened the unity of the Democratic Party and increased the growth of the Republicans. His first speech on the House floor came in 1858 and argued the Southern position on Kansas. Despite his acknowledgement that the Kansas climate was not conducive to slavery, he stated:\n\nMiles was re-elected in 1858. In January 1859 he spoke in support of fellow fire-eater William Lowndes Yancey in advocating the repeal of federal laws banning the African slave trade. Miles felt that the regulation of the trade should be a state function and that the national ban was an insult to Southern honor. This stance was considered too radical even by his friends, such as Trescott, who felt, since it could never be supported by the majority of the nation, that Miles' stance was simply a guise to force disunion.\n\nJohn Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry sent a shock wave across the South. When the Thirty-sixth Congress met in December 1859 the first order of business was the selection of a speaker. Already in turmoil over the Brown raid, Southerners were further aggravated by the nomination of Ohio Republican John Sherman for the post. Sherman was one of 68 Republicans who had endorsed Hinton Helper's book, \"The Impending Crisis and How to Meet It\", which Southerners believed would ignite class warfare between slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South. Republicans proposed buying 100,000 copies of the book and distributing it throughout the country. Miles conspired with South Carolina's governor to send a regiment of militia to Washington to break up the Congress in the event of Sherman's election, but the withdrawal of Sherman's nomination prevented action.\n\nIn South Carolina the state legislature was unable to determine an appropriate response, but finally, reacting to a proposal by pro-secession Governor William Henry Gist decided to propose a Southern convention. As a first step Christopher Memminger was dispatched to Virginia in order to solicit their support. Miles advised Memminger to \"urge our Carolina view in such a manner as to imbue Virginia with it ... [and] we may soon hope to see the fruit of your addresses in the sturdy and healthy offspring of whose birth we would be so greatly proud — a Southern confederacy.\n\nBy 1860 Miles was one of the leading secessionists in South Carolina. His position in Washington, D.C., allowed him to serve as a conduit in the flow of information between Washington and Charleston. State politicians focused on the upcoming Democratic Convention scheduled in Charleston beginning on April 23. Miles was concerned about the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas, especially rumors that there might even be a pro-Douglas faction in South Carolina. Miles and other radicals were convinced that only a strictly Southern party could properly address the state's needs.\n\nThe convention deadlocked over the party platform. Southerners opposed Douglas' support for popular sovereignty – a concept which would have allowed new territories to decide for themselves whether or not to allow slavery. Southerners preferred federal guarantees that slavery would be allowed in all United States territories. Thirteen of the 16 South Carolina delegates walked out of the convention. In May Miles returned to Charleston and declared that the next election would pit \"power against principle – the majority against the minority, regardless of all constitutional barriers.\"\n\nSupport for secession was strong in South Carolina even before Lincoln's election. Miles pressed the issue, urging action as opposed to simply more discussion. Miles stated, according to a July 24 newspaper account:\n\nMiles argued that South Carolina should \"break up things generally, which any state can at any time do.\" He believed that the South had \"all the elements of wealth, prosperity and strength, to make her a first-class power among the nations of the world\" and would \"lose so little and gain so much\" with secession.\" In August Miles was struck with typhoid fever and went to New England to recover, not returning to the state until the November elections.\n\nAs secession loomed, President James Buchanan was concerned about the safety of United States property in South Carolina. Miles, returning to Washington for the upcoming session of Congress, was one of the South Carolina delegates who met with Buchanan to discuss this problem. On December 10 Miles and the others presented a letter to the President that assured him that the forts in Charleston would not be molested \"provided that no reinforcement should be sent into those forts, and their relative military status\" maintained. Buchanan questioned the word \"provided\" since it appeared to bind him, but the delegates assured him that they were only communicating their understanding based on the status quo. According to both Miles and fellow South Carolina fire-eater Laurence M. Keitt, Buchanan said, \"After all, this is a matter of honor among gentlemen. I do not know that any paper or writing is necessary. We understand each other.\"\n\nReturning to South Carolina, Miles was elected as a delegate to the South Carolina secession convention. Miles was for immediate action. On December 17, fearing that even a few days of delay could be critical, he opposed the relocation of the convention from Columbia to Charleston due to a smallpox outbreak. Miles' last communications with southerners in Washington told him that they were all looking to South Carolina for leadership. Miles attitude was reflected in his statement, \"Let us act if we mean to act without talking. Let it be 'a word and a blow – but the blow first.\" \n\nThe convention adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20. Miles, along with other South Carolinians, immediately resigned his seat in Congress. In the months ahead, Miles, believing in the possibility of peaceful secession, opposed precipitate action over either Fort Sumter or the Star of the West incident. In February 1861 Miles was one of eight South Carolina delegates to the Confederate Convention in Montgomery, Alabama, that established the Confederacy.\n\nMiles was selected for both the provisional and regular Confederate Congress. He was chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee while also serving as an aide-de-camp for General P. G. T. Beauregard at both Charleston, in the buildup to the attack on Fort Sumter, and the First Battle of Bull Run. Recognizing, however, his own lack of military training, Miles focused most of his attention on his congressional duties.\n\nHistorian Eric H. Walther describes Miles tenure in the Confederate Congress:\n\nWhile serving in the Confederate Provisional Congress, Miles chaired the \"Committee on the Flag and Seal,\" which adopted the \"Stars and Bars\" flag as the national flag of the Confederacy. Miles opposed this selection because, he felt, it too much resembled, as supporters of it admitted, the old Stars and Stripes. Miles argued:\n\nMiles favored his own design. When General P.G.T. Beauregard decided a more recognizable Battle Flag was needed, Miles' suggested his design. Although this design had been rejected by the committee for a national flag, it eventually became the Confederate Battle Flag, today often referred to as a \"Rebel flag\" or the \"Southern Cross.\" Miles' design was later used as the field in the second version of the national flag (nicknamed the \"Stainless Banner\") as well as in the third national design (nicknamed the \"Blood-Stained Banner\").\n\nAs late as January 1865, Miles offered a resolution in Congress stating, \"That we, the representatives of the people of the Confederate States, are firmly determined to continue the struggle in which we are involved until the United States shall acknowledge our independence.\"\n\nDescribing Miles's feelings shortly after the war ended and quoting from a September 25, 1865 letter, Walther wrote:\n\nMiles had married Bettie Beirne in 1863, the daughter of a wealthy Virginia planter, Oliver Beirne, and granddaughter of Representative Andrew Beirne. For a few years after the war, he worked for his father-in-law as a factor in New Orleans. In 1867, Miles took over the management of Oak Ridge Plantation in Nelson County, Virginia. He encountered serious financial problems as a tobacco and wheat farmer, and in 1874, he unsuccessfully applied for the position of president at the new Hopkins University of Baltimore. Miles remained on the farm and helped friends like Beauregard and former Fire-Eater Robert Rhett gather materials for their own histories of the Confederacy.\n\nIn 1880, Miles was appointed president of the newly-reopened South Carolina College. After his father-in-law's death in 1882, Miles took over the family business interests and relocated to Houmas House in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, where he managed a dozen plantations that Oliver Beirne had inherited just one year before at the death of his longtime friend, John Burnside. In 1892, with his son, he formed Miles Planting and Manufacturing Company of Louisiana.\n\nMiles died on May 13, 1899 at 76 and was interred at Green Hill Cemetery in Union, West Virginia.\n\n"}
