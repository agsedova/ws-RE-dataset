{"id": "1973422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973422", "title": "Emily Gilmore", "text": "Emily Gilmore\n\nEmily Gilmore is a fictional character who appears in the American comedy-drama television series \"Gilmore Girls\" (2000 – 2007) and its revival \"\" (2016) as the matriarch of the eponymous family. Portrayed by actress Kelly Bishop, the character was created by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino in order to add a tragic element to the show's light-hearted nature. Emily has had a complicated relationship with her daughter Lorelai ever since the character ran away at age 16 to raise her newborn daughter Rory on her own. They remain estranged for several years until Lorelai asks her parents to help pay for Rory's schooling, to which Emily agrees on the condition that her daughter and granddaughter visit them for dinner every Friday evening.\n\nOne of the show's central storylines, Emily's relationship with Lorelai remains strained for the majority of the series, improving incrementally over time. Bishop, who prefers portraying acerbic over nice women, based her performance on her own grandmother. In \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\", Emily, recently widowed after the passing away of Richard, continues to mourn his death from which she struggles to move on. The death of her co-star and close friend Edward Herrmann, who portrayed Richard, was written into the revival; Bishop used her character's storyline about adjusting to life without her husband to cope with her own grief over Herrmann's passing, as well as drawing upon inspiration from the death of her own mother. The actress nearly did not reprise her role in the revival due to her own husband's health at the time.\n\nBishop's performances in both the original series and its sequel have been positively received by television critics. Critics and audiences were initially divided over the character's personality, debating her unlikeability and whether or not she is a bad mother. However, their opinions towards Emily have softened in retrospect, growing to sympathize with the character and defend her as one of the show's most complex characters who truly cares for the well-being of her family members. Despite being accused of racism in regards to the way in which she treats her maids, Emily's arc in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\", in which she takes on a more central role, has been widely acclaimed by critics and fans alike, becoming a fan favorite and experiencing renewed popularity. Critics and fans have since dubbed her the \"third Gilmore girl\", after Lorelai and Rory.\n\nThe wealthy matriarch of the Gilmore family, Emily lives with her husband Richard (Edward Herrmann), a successful insurance consultant, in a mansion in Hartford, Connecticut. Her only daughter Lorelai (Lauren Graham) had run away from home as a teenager to raise her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) on her own, forcing Emily to remain estranged from both her daughter and granddaughter for several years until Lorelai desperately asks her parents to help pay for Rory's admission into Chilton Preparatory School. Emily agrees to loan Lorelai the money required on the condition that both she and Rory visit her and Richard at their home for dinner every Friday evening. Having had a strained relationship with Lorelai ever since she decided she would be raising Rory without her parents or then-boyfriend Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe), Emily wants to spend as much time with Rory as possible, partially to ensure that her granddaughter receives the opportunities her mother never did. She uses Chilton as an opportunity to forge somewhat of a \"normal\" relationship between herself, Lorelai and Rory. Their arrangement continues when Rory graduates from Chilton and enrolls at Yale University, her grandfather's alma mater. Emily and Richard separate at one point during the series over a series of heated disagreements, but eventually reconcile in favor of renewing their vows.\n\nEmily struggles to adjust to her husband's recent death, to whom she had been married for 50 years. She is furious with Lorelai after she gives an unflattering speech during Richard's funeral, thus increasing the rift in their relationship. Emily tricks Lorelai into attending therapy with her in attempt to mend their relationship (where Emily reveals she is also upset over a malicious letter she insists Lorelai sent her several years ago, although she denies it), with mostly unfruitful results. Emily is only able to forgive Lorelai after she calls her mother to share with her the time Richard comforted her by taking her to a see a movie after she was humiliated in school. At the end of the revival, Emily sells their mansion because it constantly reminds her of Richard's death, moving to Nantucket, Massachusetts. She also quits the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), and starts working at a whaling museum as a docent. The identity of who sent Emily the letter remains undisclosed.\n\nCreator Amy Sherman-Palladino originally pitched \"Gilmore Girls\" to The WB as a series about Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a young mother and daughter duo whose close relationship is more similar to that of a pair of best friends as opposed to family members, but the show's concept was not fully realized until Sherman-Palladino introduced the idea of a third, older generation of Gilmores to the storyline: Emily and Richard Gilmore, Lorelai's wealthy, conservative parents. The creator explained that \"Lorelai is made because of her experience with her family, and Emily is Emily because Lorelai left\", believing Emily's relationship with Lorelai \"added a layer of conflict that allows you to do the comedy, but at the base of it, it’s almost a tragedy.” One of the show's central conflicts is drawn from the fact that Emily is a \"confused\" character in several ways, particularly in regards to her complicated relationship with Lorelai. \"Gilmore Girls\"' original main source conflict revolves around \"the generational battle between\" the domineering Emily and Lorelai, her free-spirited daughter. Secretly, the character is proud of her daughter's accomplishments but has continued to harbor resentment towards her ever since she gets pregnant at age 16, for which Emily has never quite forgiven her.The pilot episode begins with some form of dramatic change altering the lives of Emily, Lorelai and Rory. While Lorelai, for the good of her daughter, must reluctantly allow her parents back into the life she deliberately built for herself without them, Emily's life suddenly changes from barely having a relationship with either her daughter or granddaughter for several years to manipulating their financial situation so that she can be involved in both of their lives for the first time. Sherman-Palladino strongly felt that \"Gilmore Girls\" would be successful after watching the pilot for the first time, in which Emily, Lorelai and Rory experience their first of several Friday-night dinners. Subsequently, Emily's relationship with Lorelai would be explored in virtually all of the show's episodes, establishing itself as one of the dramedy's \"major plot points\". The \"New York Post\"'s David K. Li summarized Emily's role in the series as \"a cold-water reminder of what some mothers are really like.\" \"The Washington Post\" contributor Jenny Rogers believes Emily's was written in a way that \"was supposed to drive [audiences] crazy\", similar to the way in which Lorelai reacts.\n\nThe character spends many early episodes behaving as though not much time has passed since Lorelai ran away. Although initially created to resemble a \"complex\" villain, fans believe that Emily appears to grow \"softer\" towards the second and third seasons, when in fact the writers only \"explained [her] a little better\" by evolving the character into a \"more complex\" version of herself. As \"emotionally guarded\" individuals, both mother and daughter channel their feelings towards each other in different ways. While Emily typically avoids the topic of Lorelai's upbringing, Lorelai refuses to acknowledge how abandoned she felt by her mother, \"hid[ing] her feelings behind a rapidfire series of jokes.\" The character continues to evolve into a more complicated character as the series progresses. The first season episode \"Emily in Wonderland\", in which Emily visits Stars Hollow for the first time and wears a pair of sneakers at Rory's behest, offers an early example of the character's willingness to change in order to spend more time with and please Rory. However, her relationship with Lorelai remains strained well into the fifth season; the creator explained that she retained this dynamic because \"In life, you never solve your family issues ... You take a few steps forward and feel like 'We're communicating better!' Then something happens and you're like, 'Why didn't I see that coming?\" Thus, they remain \"firmly ... in their estranged battleground.\" At one point Sherman-Palladino had deliberated introducing a woman slightly older than Lorelai – a widow who approaches Emily for help on being \"more than just beautiful\" in the wake of her wealthy husband's death – who becomes something of a surrogate daughter to Emily. This character and related storyline about Emily \"finally ha[ving] a daughter figure who wants to be like her\" would have augmented the conflict in Emily's relationship with Lorelai. Sherman-Palladino identified Emily as one of her favorite characters to write for.\n\nThe tense relationship between Emily, \"a wealthy mother of a certain generation and class,\" and Lorelai is one of the series' primary components. Although much of Emily's storyline is directly related to her relationship with Lorelai, the character has endured complex situations on her own during the show's run, particularly in regards to the fact that she is \"a woman of a certain generation who had long tethered her future to little other than her husband.\" The character sometimes struggles to determine \"How a woman of her age and position should fill her days\", sometimes \"play[ing] Emily’s devotion to her husband for ridicule,\" according to Rogers. As one of the show's higher class characters, Emily and Paris Gellar, Rory's schoolmate and friend, share \"similarly ridiculous lines of dialogue.\" Much like Lorelai and Rory, Emily speaks \"in machine-gun like bursts of dialogue\".\n\nEmily is portrayed by American actress Kelly Bishop. Before being cast as both a mother and grandmother in \"Gilmore Girls\", Bishop had played mothers in several successful films, namely \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987), \"Private Parts\" (1997) and \"Wonder Boys\" (2000). Prior to receiving the \"Gilmore Girls\" script, Bishop had turned down several sitcom pilots, few of which she found promising; the majority of them were Italian roles due to the popularity of \"The Sopranos\" at the time. Upon reading the \"Gilmore Girls\" script for the first time, Bishop immediately found its dialogue \"deeply funny\" and interesting, in addition to appreciating the way in which the show depicts different mother-daughter relationships. She then expressed particular interest in the role of Emily to her agent before preparing to audition, recalling that \"I ... really did my homework on that audition because I wanted to deliver what I thought Amy wanted and what I heard in my head.\" Casting directors Jill Anthony and Julie Mossberg selected Bishop, whose performance immediately impressed Sherman-Palladino and producer Gavin Polone, from an assortment of actresses who had auditioned for the role during a casting session in New York.\n\nThroughout her filmography, Bishop tends to play \"acerbic\" characters more than \"nice\" ones the latter of which she finds rather \"dull.\" Bishop enjoys portraying \"nasty, rich women\" such as Emily because she \"can’t stand them\", and thus attempts to make the character seem \"as awful as possible.” Although she enjoys playing the role, Bishop admitted that Emily is not the kind of person she would enjoy being friends with in real life because of how difficult she can be, her stubbornness and self-consciousness; she based her performance on women she has met in New York, Florida and Hollywood, in addition to several wealthy women. However, Bishop described her character as \"funny ... if you don’t have to live with her\". Despite not liking Emily as a character, Bishop \"understand[s] where she’s coming form (sic)\" as a mother. The actress also identified Emily's honesty among her more positive attributes, saying, \"I don't recall ever doing an episode where she was really lying to anyone or sneaking around. She wasn't ever doing anything deceptive, she was just straight-on.\" Emily's personality also reminds Bishop of her own grandmother, from whom she drew inspiration. Bishop also believes Emily was based on former United States First Ladies Nancy Reagan and Jackie Kennedy. Overall, the actress identified her character's unpleasant nature as \"the fun [part] of playing her\", and refuses to apologize for her behavior.\n\nBishop has always been confident in the material Sherman-Palladino writes for Emily, explaining, \"I’ve never had one moment ... that I’ve looked down [at a script] and gone, ‘No, she wouldn’t say that,'”. Throughout her entire time working on \"Gilmore Girls\", Bishop refused to probe Sherman-Palladino for information or secrets regarding her character's upcoming storylines, preferring to \"open the scripts as if it was a present\". Although Bishop sometimes found Emily's behavior surprising and difficult to defend, she usually agreed with the way in which her character is written, believing her and Sherman-Palladino \"see eye to eye completely on this characterfrie.\" Bishop wanted to analyze and learn exactly why Emily is the way she is. The actress found it helpful to \"flesh out\" her character by providing her with her own backstory, which was often coincidentally similar to what Sherman-Palladino and the writers had envisioned. Sherman-Palladino would often write an expository piece for the character that Bishop had thought of herself years before, remarking, \"well, we are so on the same page.\" Bishop often asked Graham to explain certain pop culture references she had difficulty understanding. The actress credits her work on \"Gilmore Girls\" with teaching her about camera work, explaining, \"I’d done all that stuff before. But having it day after day, year after year, being able to work the set and work the camera, it developed my technique and it’s an exercise that you just have to keep repeating\". Bishop considers the fourth season episode \"The Reigning Lorelai\", in which Emily learns that her late mother-in-law Trix tried to dissuade Richard from marrying her as her favorite episode because of how \"bizarrely out there\" and unlike Emily it was, claiming that she was \"drunk in every scene\". The actress also identified episodes in which Emily goes on outrageous shopping sprees with Lorelai and Rory among some of her other favorites. Although Bishop usually enjoyed the meals they were served during Friday-night dinners, she identified the confection marzipan as the worst dish she ever had to eat during a scene. Bishop practiced taking small bites of her food because she could not envision her character talking with her mouth full as her co-stars tended to do. Because the actors were prohibited to consume alcohol on set, Emily's wine was often substituted with colored water for Bishop to drink. She would sometimes be allowed to take home some of her character's floral centerpieces, which she had always found \"amazing\". Bishop adds that she has been \"madly in love with\" on-screen daughter Graham \"from practically the first day we said hi\", to the point of which she constantly gave her advice about her love life. Bishop said Graham \"really is like my daughter\".\n\nMashable contributor Proma Khosla believes \"Bishop embodies the Emily we knew during \"Gilmore Girls\"’ seven seasons: classily dressed and put-together, with the aura of someone who’s better than you, even if Bishop doesn’t gloat about it like her character.\" Bishop appreciates Sherman-Palladino for employing her as an \"older\" actress. Although \"Gilmore Girls\" was Bishop and Herrmann's first time working together, they had met once before at the 30th Tony Awards in 1976 after both winning awards for featured actress and actor in a musical and play, respectively. They would not meet again until nearly 25 years later when they posed for a family portrait that would hang in their characters' mansion for the series. Bishop developed a strong, platonic comradery with Herrmann that mirrored the fictional relationship between their characters. Bishop bonded with Herrmann over the fact that they were the show's two oldest cast members, and would often do crossword puzzles in the hair and make up room together. In addition to sharing the same trailer, Bishop would accompany Herrmann to the \"Gilmore Girls\" set early, before the other cast members. After the series finale, Bishop maintained her friendship with Herrmann via e-mail. Herrmann's real life wife Star dubbed Bishop Herrmann's \"second wife\". Having maintained a real-life mother-daughter relationship, Graham and Bishop affectionately refer to each other as their TVM (TV mom) and TVD (TV daughter), respectively.\n\nRichard suffers several medical emergencies during the original series, which usually result in Emily worrying about having to potentially live without her husband. On one occasion, Emily convinces Richard to promise that he not die before her, saying, \"I demand to go first.\" Herrmann passed away in 2014. \"\" revolves around Emily, Lorelai and Rory as the characters encounter new life challenges. Sherman-Palladino felt that the revival should mirror each main characters' role in the original \"Gilmore Girls\" pilot, in which \"all three women were at a change in their lives.\" Herrmann's death was written into \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" by having his character also die shortly prior to the events of the series. Despite admitting that doing another \"Gilmore Girls\" project without Herrmann would be \"really complicated\", she expressed confidence Sherman-Palladino's ability to \"handle that level of emotions, but still keep it funny\". The creator decided that Emily's change would revolve around the character coming to terms with the fact that she can no longer be with her husband. His death is discussed most prominently in the first episode \"Winter\", during which Emily's fears about living without Richard are realized. \"The Washington Post\"'s Jenny Rogers observed that the character \"now has a few decades of life left without the person for whom she seemed to live\", forced to make decisions about dating. Feeling purposeless in the aftermath of her husband's death, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" follows Emily \"as she tries to find a way forward through her grief and confusion\" during her first year as a widow. Bishop originally believed that her character would resume Friday-night dinners in the wake of her husband's death \"because it's one of those schedule structures that she has in place\". Sherman-Palladino decided to write the eldest Gilmore \"in an unexpected direction.\" In \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\", Emily experiences more dramatic changes than she had experience during her seven-year arc on \"Gilmore Girls\", embarking \" on the biggest journey\" of the three main characters. Leah Thomas of \"Bustle\" summarized Emily's storyline as \"one of re-discovery and reflection.\" With a progression that is of equal importance to that of her daughter and granddaughter, Emily takes on a more central role than she ever did in the original series, particularly during the \"Winter\" and \"Fall\" segments, \"tak[ing] the spotlight as a character in her own right\" according to \"Vanity Fair\"'s Laura Bradley. According to Sherman-Palladino, Emily's storyline as a new widow explores what \"the death of a husband mean[s] to a woman who had a life very specific to her all of these years\", encountering widowhood and loneliness for the first time in her life. Bishop described her character as \"a raw nerve\" as a result of losing her husband, alternating between being \"right on the edge of losing it\" and \"a little manic\", as well as having both \"dreadful\" and \"touching\" moments during her mourning process.\n\nEmily struggles to cope with Richard's death. In addition to accidentally commissioning a wall-sized portrait of her late husband, she attempts such exercises as dividing her belongings into items that \"bring her joy\" and ones that do no, inspired by Japanese organizing consultant Marie Kondo's self-help book \"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing\", discarding a fancy dress while movers remove her dining room chairs. Emily also dresses differently than how she does throughout the original seven seasons of \"Gilmore Girls\", particularly wearing a T-shirt and jeans for the first time. She even attempts dating another man, only to end their relationship when she finds him disappointing. The death of her husband ultimately causes Emily to undergo the most change and development out of all the show's main characters, a gradual progression with which Bishop was \"delighted\", elaborating, \"I liked her seeing her really evolve and grow and try to find herself and all of the different stages of grief between the pain and the loss and the rage and the confusion and trying to find what the next step is for her.\" Overall, Bishop believes her character channels her grief \"pretty well.\"\n\nEmily's relationship with Lorelai is also directly affected by Richard's passing, both positively and negatively. Richard once served as \"the middle ground between\" Emily and Lorelai, who was often \"the most diplomatic of\" Lorelai's parents. After Lorelai speaks poorly of her father at his funeral, Emily tricks Lorelai into finally attending therapy with her in an attempt to mend their relationship. Although the sessions do not appear to be very fruitful, it is the first time they mutually acknowledge that there is a problem in their relationship. Just recognizing that there is a problem is a great first step. Bishop believes \"there’s a little bit more of a womanly connection between the two of them than a mother-daughter thing, but certainly the conflicts and the problems between mother and daughter arise, and very dramatically in one scene.\" The characters are marginally closer friends than they ever were on \"Gilmore Girls\" by the end of the revival.\n\nSince \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" was to be released on the streaming service Netflix, the writers debated whether or not the characters should be allowed to swear for the first time, particularly Emily. Sherman-Palladino ultimately decided that Emily would be the only character who swears in the series, using profanity against the fellow members of the DAR; she describes organization as \"bullshit\" three times after growing restless as they interview a potential new member, before she quits the group. Uttering \"This whole thing died with Richard anyway\", Bishop explained that Emily \"doesn't see any point in it [anymore]. Obviously, these women were not her friends, they were her social circle ... so she didn't really have any reason to hang around with them anymore and she was seeing through the whole thing. She had, actually, the whole time. She saw the hypocrisy in their behavior. I don't know that she disagreed with it back in her other days – that was just the way it is. Now she's just looking at all of life and calling it out in a way.\" Emily ultimately relinquishes control of the organization to Toni, portrayed by actress Carolyn Hennesy, with whom Bishop had enjoyed arguing \"back and forth as to who's running the show.\"\n\nAlthough Emily's life keeps changing, Sherman-Palladino felt it important that she end the revival \"calm and settled\", at least for the time being. Bishop agreed that Emily finds \"serenity\" by the end of the series, resolving that \"After sharing her life for half a century, it's finally her own, to do with as she pleases.\" She believes that the character sells her mansion because she felt \"it was closing in on her\", and there was little left for her there beyond her fond memories of Richard. The actress defends her decision to relocate to her vacation home in Nantucket because \"she had fond memories of being relaxed and comfortable\" there. Just like the pilot, the series ends with Emily blackmailing Lorelai, offering to loan her the money to expand the Dragonfly Inn – only this time Lorelai agrees to her terms willingly.\n\nHaving been expressing interest in a \"Gilmore Girls\" film for several years, Bishop was \"delighted\" to learn that a revival was being developed. Bishop was initially hesitant to commit to \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" because her husband had been unwell at the time, and reprising the role would limit her ability to care for him. However, her family encouraged Bishop to return, agreeing \"it’s something that I just have to do ... I’d be heartbroken if the show went on without me.\" The week before filming began, Bishop attended the first few table reads remotely via Skype in order to continue tending to her husband before joining the rest of the cast on location. Bishop was thoroughly \"delighted\" with the new material that had been written for Emily, enjoying \"seeing her really evolve and grow and try to find herself and all of the different stages of grief\". The way in which Emily initially deals with Richard's passing reminded Bishop of how she first responded to the death of her own mother, incorporating elements of the grief she had experienced into her performance: \"I was manic and aggressive and pushing, pushing, pushing — because, if you stop, you’re going to cry. So you don’t stop. And I see that in Emily.\" She also based her performance on widows she had met in real life. Bishop learned approximately 5,295 lines for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\". Although she found resuming the role as easy as \"putting on a favorite coat that still fits and feels amazing\", she found filming all four episodes at once to be challenging at times because they were rarely shot in order.\n\nBecause of how close Bishop was to Herrmann in real life, Star invited Bishop to bid farewell to the ailing actor when his family decided to take the actor off life support – the only non-family member to have been invited. Bishop herself found it very difficult to do the revival without Herrmann because \"he and I were buds on the show. We, obviously, were older [than the rest of the cast]. But we were also New York actors, and we connected very well ... There was a comfort level.\" Using Emily's storyline as a means of channeling her own grief at the loss of her co-star, Bishop found herself waiting for Herrmann to arrive on set during the first day of filming, and claims that the lights once flickered when she mentioned his name. She would sometimes speak to the large portrait of Herrmann's character. Bishop found Herrmann's absence particularly jarring during scenes filmed in the family dining room because \"There was [an empty] space where he was supposed to be\". Despite her comradery with her female co-stars, Bishop admitted that she felt lonely on set without Herrmann. The actress found it difficult to speak to Graham and Bledel because the former was busy writing a book during her spare time, while the latter seldom speaks, \"so I was just kind of standing around swinging my arms, not knowing what to do.\" The actress' entire performance \"is defined by the loss of the dear friend she had in Herrmann\", whose loss she incorporated into her performance. At the same time, however, Herrmann – and Richard's – deaths allow Emily to develop in ways that might not have been possible otherwise, finally allowing Bishop to explore her character's true motivations while seeing Emily \"grow a bit.\" Bishop believes Emily \"would have probably been on the same plane that we always were\" had Herrmann not died, elaborating, \"I sure miss Ed and he would have loved to have done it ... but it made for a really interesting journey for Emily.\" Bishop joked that returning to the show in 2016 taught her that \"I’m a really good actress\". Bishop enjoyed Sherman-Palladino's decision to have her character swear in the series, explaining \"That's the quirk of Amy.\"\n\nBishop maintains that she did not portray her character any differently than she had during \"Gilmore Girls\" due to having played her for so many years and knowing her very well. Despite being a complicated sequence that took particularly long to film, Emily enjoyed filming \"the Marie Kondo scene\" because \"You see the first signs of Emily \"going in a direction you couldn't have imagined before.\" In terms of clothing, Emily's clothes changes the most during the revival, beginning with her baseball T-shirt as \"a slight hint\" of her wardrobe progression. Wardrobe designer, Brenda Maben, enjoyed costuming Emily during the revival, particularly during \"Fall\", \"because of the things that happen with her character.” Maben explained that the character's change in attire mirrors people who \"start to find themselves\" after becoming widowed, elaborating that before they can move on from their deaths they \"have to look inside yourself and make decisions and quite possibly make some changes and continue on without the person you are terribly in love with. And it could be going back to something you had earlier in your life before you had your spouse that maybe you might have wanted to do but you didn't do because of having children and living that particular life.\" Bishop said she \"had great fun\" wearing jeans as her character for the first time, which are Steve Madden. Maben echoed that creating Emily's new wardrobe was fun because it \"was something we had never seen before so that was quite fun for me\", despite admitting that she found the jeans \"ugly\". Kelly and Maben agreed that Emily should still wear her signature gold necklace and earrings atop her more casual attire, explaining, \"when you’re DAR ... on top of old money, you don't change up your jewelry a lot ... She's still that same person—there are just a lot of changes that are coming along.” The T-shirt bears a faded Candie's logo. After finding one proved difficult, Maben sought permission from the company to have the logo specially printed on the shirt. Maben explained that the logo \"It needed to be not in your face Candie’s, but it needed to be faded where you had to really look and say, Oh, what does that say?” Although Bishop appreciated her character's sudden interest in marine life for continuing to show her growth, she disliked her speech vivaciously recounting the deaths of these animals due to being an \"animal lover\" herself, and the amount of takes the scene required for her to get it right.\n\n\"Vogue\"'s Edward Barsamian described Emily as a \"deluded, vain, and grandiose\" character who is \"a caricature of East Coast blue bloods.\" Known for being judgmental and sarcastic in nature, BuddyTV described Emily as \"snooty and very difficult to please\", while Sarah Rodman of \"The Boston Globe\" called her \"imperious and controlling\". \"The Washington Post\"'s Jenny Rogers described Emily as \"A classist meddler with a mean streak\"; her flawed personality includes her tendency to be controlling and manipulative at times. \"Bustle\"'s Mallory Carra observed that Emily \"was always a very prim and proper woman\" who \"expected everyone and everything to be in its proper place\" until her personality gradually changes in the wake of Richard's passing. However, Emily rarely loses her temper, with Erica Palan of \"Mental Floss\" describing her as a character who \"could throw down when she wanted to get her way and melt down when she didn’t.\" Emily has a reputation of being \"a resilient woman\" due to her \"tough exterior and tender heart\". Michael Moran, writing for \"The Jewish Chronicle\", dubbed Emily \"master of the passive-aggressive aside\".\n\nCinemaBlend's Corey Chichizola identified Emily as one of \"Gilmore Girls\"' \"most layered and complex characters\", writing, \"While she appears to be superficial, privileged, and conniving ... Beneath it all is a woman who is desperately seeking love and attention from her family, but is unable to compromise her beliefs.\" Justifying Emily's behavior, Bishop elaborated that her character \"is not bad just for the sake of being naughty, but she is accustomed to what people are in a certain way and she is uncomfortable when it is not as she would like. In fact, I think she's not quite sure of herself.\" As such, upper class upbringing causes her to often suppress her quirky, \"fun, creative, youthful side\" despite her occasional urges to explore it. News.com.au journalist Gavin Fernando agreed that \"Everything she says and does comes from this incredibly complex, emotional and passionate place\". \"Bustle\"'s Emily Lackey observed that the character \"is built on contradictions, always doing and saying the opposite of what she means\". Writing for the same publication, S. Atkinson agreed with Emily's complexity, describing her as \"one of the show's prickliest, but also unusually sympathetic, characters\". Erik Mink of the \"New York Daily News\" believes that Emily is just \"as smart and assertive as\" Lorelai and Rory, \"and more clever than either of them\"; she shares her daughter's sarcastic wit, which has been described as a \"deadpan\" sense of humor. She is also involved in a variety of charity organizations and clubs, particularly the DAR, but whether or not her interest t in these programs is genuine is undetermined.\n\nEmily has always been concerned about appearances and sometimes criticizing Lorelai for her own choices in clothing, such as scolding her for wearing a pair of sweatpants that read \"Juicy\". Septembre Anderson of Brit + Co remarked that the character has \"always dressed to the nine\" in contrast to Lorelai's \"lazygirl attitude when it came to style.\" \"Paste\"'s Kit Hamlen described Emily's wardrobe as \"upper echelon, high class personified\", seldom seen \"without a blazer or matching pantsuit\". Kerry Pieri, writing for \"Harper's Bazaar\", described Emily's style as \"expensive yet understated\". Julia Musto of \"Bustle\" felt that the character's \"meticulously designed and paired outfits and jewelry\" represent her \"class, wealth, status, beauty, and grace\", maintaining her \"put together\" image even at times when she is not feeling her best. Maben believes the character's original \"buttoned up\" style \"really summed her up. It was all about how she looked from the outside and she had a certain image to relay to the world because of her status in society and I truly think that look served her very well.\" One of Emily's signature pieces is a gold necklace she wears consistently throughout the series, even on rare occasions when she decides to dress down, particularly the \"funky, torn, not good-fitting jeans\" she wears in the revival. Following Richard's passing, Emily adopts are more \"relaxed fashion\", which \"Vanity Fair\"'s Hilary Weaver identified as \"grunge fashion\".\n\nAccording to Konbini's Benjamin Holt, Emily adheres to the \"bad mom\" literary trope, describing her as an example of \"a domineering matriarch with a sharp tongue and ruthless wit.\" The \"New York Post\" journalist David K. Li credits Emily's \"bickering\" relationship with Lorelai with reminding viewers what a typical mother-daughter relationship looks like, in stark contrast to Lorelai's best friend relationship with Rory. Although the characters occasionally share \"tender moments\", their relationship \"has never been ideal\" in comparison to the strong bond between Lorelai and Rory. Emily often bestows \"condescending lines and disapproving glares\" upon Lorelai, who has at times compared her mother to politicians Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. Emily strongly believes that Lorelai's life would be better if she would only listened to her, but the two characters view Lorelai's life \"in completely different terms.\" \"The Week\"'s Lili Loofbourow observed that the character can be \"callous and even cruel\" at times, even when she insists she is acting out of Lorelai's best interest. Despite disagreeing with most of Lorelai's decisions, the character is secretly proud of her daughter's accomplishments and remains \"there [for Lorelai] when it mattered\", such as caring for her when she injures her back and growing emotional upon watching Lorelai graduate from college. Diana Bruk, writing for \"Country Living\", agreed that, despite being \"suffocating and over-involved\" at times, Emily \"ferociously loves her daughter\", for whom she would do anything. Bruk insists \"everything Emily does in the show is because ... she wants the best possible\" for Lorelai. She is visibly heartbroken upon seeing the shed Lorelai chose to raise Rory in over her own home for the first time, exclaiming \"You hated us that much!\" The character often uses guilt as a means of convincing Lorelai to do her bidding. Emily's relationship with Lorelai mirrors her relationship with her mother-in-law Trix, who \"driv[es] Emily crazy.\" However, Emily is very protective of her family, as shown when she defends Lorelai from Francine Hayden, the mother of Lorelai's childhood boyfriend Christopher, and Rory from Shira Huntzberger, the mother of her boyfriend Logan upon learning that her granddaughter had been disrespected by his family, proving how much she cares for her. Emily also defends Lorelai every occasion that Christopher's father Strobe speaks poorly of her. Her decisions to leave the DAR and move to Nantucket are reminiscent of Lorelai's rebellious nature. When Emily finally moves to Nantucket, she accepts the fact that Lorelai will not be as prominent a feature in her new life. However, because she still wants to spend time with Lorelai, she offers her money to expand her inn in exchange that she visit her for two weeks during summer and one week over Christmas.\n\nEmily's biggest struggle is trying to maintain a relationship with both her daughter and granddaughter \"while doing what she thought was best\", secretly wanting little more than to finally have a good relationship with Lorelai. Li believes that the character is mostly jealous of Lorelai \"and would give anything to have the open relationship Lorelai and Rory share.\" Bishop explained that her character truly envies Lorelai's relationship with Rory because she \"doesn’t know how to do it\", struggling to understand their dynamic due to having been raised to believe that parents are not to be friends with their own children. Emily feels underappreciated by her family, often resulting in the character feeling insecure. Bishop agreed that her character is \"weirdly insecure\", a trait that makes her long for the status quo. She is heartbroken upon reading Lorelai's letter announcing she has decided to run away, when Lorelai neglects to inform her that she is engaged to Max Medina, and when Rory to leaves their home, into which she had moved after dropping out of Yale, without saying goodbye to her; Lorelai's strained relationship with Rory during this time offers viewers \"a glimpse of how Lorelai and Emily’s relationship disintegrated\" when she was a child. Flynn observed that the character is \"often on the receiving end [of mistreatment] when Lorelai and Rory's decisions were less than admirable\", but is usually willing to forgive them for the sake of maintaining their relationship. She also struggles to express how much Lorelai's actions, beginning with leaving home as a teenager to limiting contact with her granddaughter, hurt her. Emily views Rory as her \"new Lorelai\", an opportunity to \"do over\" her relationship with Lorelai and serving as something of a \"replacement\" for her daughter. However, despite being remarkably different, it has been noted that both Lorelai and Rory appear to have \"inherited their biting wit\" from Emily.\n\nUsually depicted as \"steely\" and stuck up, Emily typically hides her more intimate emotions, preferring to prioritize business over pleasure and \"cry when nobody’s looking\" in order to maintain her pride. However, Emily's more vulnerable side is revealed when she learns of Richard's continuing friendship with an ex-girlfriend of his, Pennilyn Lott. Emily is particularly aggravated by Richard when he is dishonest with her, particularly when he neglects to inform her that he has retired or his relationship with Pennilyn. Subsequently, most of Richard's decisions could potentially upturn Emily's life. Although usually quiet and composed, the temporary deterioration of her marriage to Richard reveals \"a sassier side\" in contrast to being merely a wife, becoming \"a woman who had things to say\", while becoming increasingly resentful towards his dismissiveness of her. At the same time, Richard relies on Emily for most matters that do not directly pertain to his insurance company. Despite having been married to the same person for most of her life, \"Bitch\"'s Diane Shipley observed that there have been times when Emily had to raise Lorelai as though she were a single mother herself due to Richard constantly having to travel for business. Despite being involved in several organizations and clubs, Emily does not have many close friends outside of her relationship with Richard. Emily has a tendency to interfere in Lorelai's love life, often preferring Christopher over her other love interests. In season five's \"Wedding Bell Blues\", Emily deliberately invites Christopher to her and Richard's wedding vow renewal in order to upset her current relationship with Luke Danes. Emily using Christopher to form a wedge in their relationship results in Lorelai temporarily severing contact with her mother. However, Emily orders him to leave her alone on one occasion when Lorelai refuses to speak with him, and voices resentment towards him over the fact that he let Lorelai raise Rory alone. Emily initially refuses to accept Lorelai's relationship with Luke, a diner owner, because she believes he is not good enough for her.\n\nThe way in which Emily mistreats her maids is used as a running gag throughout the series. Constantly struggling to understand what language her often foreign maids are speaking, Emily seldom bothers to get to know her domestic employees before firing them for trivial reasons such as \"clomping around the house\", and rarely keeps the same maid for more than one episode. A notable exception is Berta, a maid Emily hires after Richard's demise and uncharacteristically retains throughout all four installments of the revival, even when she moves to Nantucket and taking her entire family with her, despite the fact that she does not know what language she speaks, is unable to identify the meals she cooks and is annoyed that her large family \"keep[s] appearing.\" Anne Cohen, writing for \"Refinery 29\", believes Emily is so tolerant of Berta and her family because she finally experiences \"what it means to be alone.\" As a grandmother, Kristen Sturt of Grandparents.com observed that Emily resembles \"rich and imperious glam-mas\" who are \"as likely to bake a pie as they are to shop at Payless\", as opposed to traditional \" kindly, white-haired and wise ladies.\" Judy Berman of \"Flavorwire\" dubbed her \"the quintessential WASP grandmother\".\n\nCritical reception towards Bishop's performance has been positive since \"Gilmore Girls\" premiered in 2000. Graeme McMillan of \"Wired\" wrote that the actress \"plays Emily to perfection\", while \"The Hollywood Reporter\" commended Bishop for portraying her character \"with great moxie\". \"Us Weekly\" agreed that Bishop played the character \"perfectly\". Lauren Fries of \"Variety\" praised Bishop as a \"talented\" actress who \"make[s] Graham’s work easier and lend[s] a good deal of authority and legitimacy to the show.\" CinemaBlend contributor Adrienne Jones wrote that the actress \"helped her character display just the right amount of heart and saucy venom to engage in emotional verbal battles\". \"Bustle\"'s Alanna Bennett commended Bishop for making her character \"entirely human\" as opposed to solely \"pompous and one-dimensional\". Writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", Maureen Ryan similarly appreciated Bishop's \"lively yet precise\" performance for preventing Emily from being \"just another WASP witch\", referring to the character as \"often the best thing about the show\" while ranking her among seven things she will miss about \"Gilmore Girls\" in the wake of its finale. \"Vox\"'s Constance Grady believes that Bishop is \"entitled\" to an Emmy Award nomination for her performance, calling both her and Graham \"extraordinarily gifted actresses who play beautifully against each other\" and highlighting moments when Bishop \"gets something to sink her teeth into\". The critic also identified the season five episode \"Emily Says Hello\" during which her character sobs after returning home from a pleasant date as Bishop at her most \"fantastic\" and \"extraordinary\". \"The Telegraph\"'s Rachel Ward opined that the series had always been \"at its best\" when the \"steely...judgmental\" Emily \"showed [her] vulnerability\". Bishop's performance earned her two Golden Satellite Awards nominations for Best Actress in a Supporting Role – Musical or Comedy Series at the 7th and 8th Golden Satellite Awards in 2002 and 2004, respectively. Fans of the series of long lamented the fact that the Emmy Awards did not acknowledge Bishop's performance is the series during its seven-year run.\n\nReception towards Emily's characterization has varied greatly, with opinions ranging from positive to negative. In 2002, Zap2it contributor Amy Amatangelo named Emily one of television's \"10 Best Characters\", calling her relationship with Lorelai the show's \"most gripping\". \"Vanity Fair\"'s Joanna Robinson felt that Emily was the only character whose personality was not harmed by the series' much-maligned seventh season. News.com.au's Gavin Fernando hailed Emily as \"The Greatest Character Ever\", describing her as \"perfection\" and criticizing the \"painful\" way in which she is depicted as a villain. Advising fans to forget about Lorelai and Rory, Fernando concluded that Emily \"is the real star of\" \"Gilmore Girls\". \"The Christian Post\" contributor Jilianne Arbonida called Emily a \"better\" version of Lorelai. Shari Nementzik of \"Cosmopolitan\" described the character's one-liners as \"memorable\", whose neurotic personality she eventually \"learnt to love\". As one of the show's most vilified characters who some critics initially perceived as \"one-dimensional\", Emily has constantly been criticized for being a manipulative character who uses wealth to achieve her goals. Some fans of the series dismiss the character as \"elitist and judgmental.\" David K. Li, writing for the \"New York Post\", dubbed Emily quite possibly \"the most unlikable mother on TV\" but admitted she is the reason \"the show feel[s] real.\" Beamly compiled a list of \"5 times We Really, Truly Hated Emily Gilmore\", calling her \"not quite a villain but she’s not exactly a heroine either.\" IndieWire ranked the character one of the least important \"Gilmore Girls\" characters at number 67, admitting \"There are things about Emily that are nice. That are entertaining. That are admirable\", but criticizing her for causing Lorelai and Luke to break up, among other reasons \"why we have no patience with her behavior.\" Author Shannon Liz Miller also enjoyed watching Trix \"dr[ive] Emily insane\".\n\nIn retrospect, several critics have grown to appreciate and defend Emily. Diana Bruk of \"Country Living\" admitted that although she often sided with Lorelai while watching \"Gilmore Girls\" as a child, labeling Emily \"a bad mother\", her opinion has since changed to regard the character as \"just like any other mother\" with whom the character shares several positive traits, among them wanting the best for her daughter. Similarly, Kayleigh Roberts of \"Marie Claire\" identified with Rory as a teenager but ultimately grew see Emily as her \"favorite Gilmore Girl\" as an adult, dubbing her \"the Gilmore lady I aspire to emulate\". Defending the character from some fans who \"might not be so happy to see Emily make a return\" in an article entitled \"Why Emily Gilmore Is Better Than You Give Her Credit For\", \"Bustle\"'s Caitlin Flynn described her as \"wonderful in a different way\" from Lorelai and Rory, despite her flaws, commending her complexity and praising her one-liners. Emily Lackey, also writing for \"Bustle\", hailed the character as \"The Best Part Of \"Gilmore Girls\"\", calling her the main reason fans \"were obsessed with\" the series. The author admitted that she did not appreciate Emily's character role until the show's fifth season, when she started watching to see what the character \"would do next\", crediting her complex nature with making her \"such an amazing character\" and her criticism of Shira Huntzberger with establishing her as \"your favorite Gilmore girl of all time\" before concluding \"there really was no better reason to watch \"Gilmore Girls\" than Emily Gilmore herself.\" Kaitlyn Laurie of Celebuzz admitted she \"can’t help but have only love for Emily\". Emily's exchange with Shira is often identified as one of the character's finest moments.\n\nOnce considered to be one of the show's most underrated, overlooked characters, Emily has experienced newfound popularity and appreciation as a result of her role in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\", since becoming a fan favorite. \"Bustle\" contributor Caitlin Flynn believes that Emily was originally ignored by audiences because she belongs to an older generation than most \"Gilmore Girls\" fans. Wetpaint's Gaby Corsalini observed that the revival reminded audiences \"just how underappreciated and underrated Emily Gilmore’s character always was.\" When the revival was announced, BuzzFeed's Krystie Lee Yandoli heralded the return of Emily \"into our lives.\" Jenny Rogers, writing for \"The Washington Post\", expected Emily to be \"the only reason to watch the ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival\", reevaluating her as a \"great\" character upon re-watching the original series while preferring her \"biting\" sense of humor over Lorelai and Rory’s. Rogers also believed that Emily would be the only main character who could evolve reasonably enough to satisfy fans. PopSugar's Erin Hurley wrote that Emily \"never disappoints when it comes to snark,\" insisting that it and her \"burns\" be featured prominently in the revival.\n\nMost critics and fans agree that the character provides the majority of the revival's highlights. Comparing the character's storyline to that of a phoenix rising from the ashes, Laura Bradley of \"Vanity Fair\" appreciated Emily for \"sav[ing] us from her progeny’s typical, tedious flailing\", writing, \"she’s no Rory or Lorelai, but isn’t that exactly what we love about Emily Gilmore?\" In a separate review, Bradley crowned Emily the \"Real Star\" of the revival and wrote that she \"is back and better than ever\", praising her development as \"the only [character] who shows any semblance of personal growth\". \"Refinery29\"'s Anne Cohen echoed Bradley's sentiment, dubbing Emily \"The Best Character In \"A Year In The Life\"\" while highlighting her as \"the only one who truly comes into her own.\" Cohen also Believes that Emily has always been \"the most stable, caring character\" on \"Gilmore Girls\", despite her flaws. Margaret Lyons of \"The New York Times\" agreed that Emily's storyline \"had the most emotional weight and credibility\", describing herself as \"elated to see her claw her way back to a life she wanted.\" \"Bustle\" contributor Lea Thomas dubbed Emily's conclusion \"one of the most touching and memorable in the revival\". \"The Vine\"'s Tara Watson described Emily as \"a joy to watch\" due to Bishop's \"phenomenal\" performance and the \"unexpected direction\" in which the character was written. \"Bustle\"'s Mallory Carra identified the scene in which Emily confronts the DAR as \"poignant\" and \"one of the show's best scenes ever\". Critics agreed that Bishop's performance was worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. TVLine felt that Bishop's performance deserved a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. Writing for the same publication, Dave Nemetz agreed that Bishop \"is long overdue for a Supporting Actress nomination\", calling her performance \"masterful\" Praising her for excelling in both her characters \"explosive\" and quieter moments, the website joked, \"If there’s an Emmy voter out there who doesn’t deem Bishop worthy of a long overdue nomination, we’d like to point you in the direction of Emily’s new favorite word: 'Bullshit.'\" In a slightly less positive review, Lydia Snapper of \"Cliché Magazine\" wrote that although she \"loved Emily’s transformation through the grieving process\", she found her moving to Nantucket to work as a whaling docent implausible.\n\nTVLine's Michael Ausiello dubbed Bishop \"a national treasure\" for providing \"the revival’s most crowd-pleasing moment.\" Shannon Vestal Robinson, writing for PopSugar, cited Emily among seven reasons \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" should be renewed for a second season, calling the character's role her \"favorite character development for Emily ever\". The jeans and T-shirt combination Emily wears in the revival has garnered significant attention from fans and the media since it was first seen in the trailer, with Mashable's Proma Khosla calling the outfit \"legendary\". E! reported that critics and fans were unable to stop talking about the outfit. Bishop admitted that the jeans were intended to shock audiences, Maben was surprised that the producers decided to include the scene in which Emily debuts the outfit in the trailer, at first assuming that they would have preferred to keep it as a surprise until the revival was released. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the jeans among \"the most shocking moments of the revival\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Mandi Bierly wrote that fans remember Bishop \"fondly\" as Emily. Fans and the media have dubbed Emily \"the third Gilmore girl\". Bishop admitted that she is confused by how popular her character is among fans, despite her personality. Bishop recalls being surprised when fans approach her to tell her how much the character reminds them of their own female relatives: \"my mother, my aunt, my sister ... The only thing that makes me a little uncomfortable is when someone says you’re just like my wife.\"\n\nEdward Barsamian of \"Vogue\" published an article entitled \"13 Life Lessons I Learned from Emily Gilmore\", writing, \"whether you love or loathe her, [Emily] provided countless life lessons many of which some of us still use today.\" \"Bustle\" contributor Caitlin Flynn dubbed the character \"one of the most underrated moms on TV\". BuddyTV placed Emily at number 13 on their \"Worst TV Moms Ever\" ranking. \"Flavorwire\" placed Emily at number seven on the website's ranking of \"The Top 10 TV Grandmas of All Time\". TV.com ranked Emily the 15th greatest television grandmother. Grandparents.com included Emily among \"The 22 Greatest TV Grandparents\". \"Bustle\" published an article recognizing \"13 Emily Gilmore Fashion Lessons That We Can All Learn From\", calling it \"widely underrated\" while praising her use of \"accessories, shapes, and colors to make each outfit pop.\" According to author Julia Musto, the character also teaches \"lessons about how to be an actual Queen, awesome grandmother, expert shopper, and brutally destroy your enemies with their deepest and darkest fears and insecurities.\" \"The Daily Beast\"'s Kevin Fallon dubbed the character \"the beacon of taste and class\". Hollywood.com published a list of the character's \"10 Best Burns\", crowning her \"the queen of burns.\" \"Mental Floss\" compiled a list of the character's \"Best Freak-Outs\". Emily remains the role for which Bishop is best known. In 2012, Sherman-Palladino cast Bishop as Fanny Flowers in her comedy-drama television series \"Bunheads\".\n\nThe way Emily treats her maids has been widely criticized, a common complaint made against an otherwise well-received character. Several critics have accused the running gag of being racist due to the fact that the majority of Emily's maids are non-English-speaking women of color, who she often fires. Christopher Rosa of \"Glamour\" felt that \"there isn't anything funny about a spoiled white person disposing of women working in her home like they aren't human beings.\" \"The Frisky\"'s Divya Amladi dismissed the running gag as \"Gilmore Girls\"' \"most condescending storyline\". Amladi admitted that she struggles to determine if the writers intended for the running joke to be taken humorously or seriously. Critics have been slightly more tolerant of Emily's relationship with Berta, a maid she retains throughout the entire duration of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\", some of whom have reviewed their dynamic as \"generous\" and \"sweet\" due to the fact that Berta appears to be a \"more humanized\" character than Emily's previous maids.\n\nDespite agreeing that Emily's relationship with her maids has always seemed racist, calling it \"Gilmore Girls\"' \"weirdest vice\", VH1's Anna Cincera appreciated the fact that Emily acquired Berta as a friend, receiving it as a method of \"apologiz[ing] for all that aforementioned casual racism\" but would have preferred if \"Emily learns Spanish to talk to her friend like humans do\". Ali of VH1 welcomed their relationship, believing that Berta \"bring[s Emily] joy\" after Richard's death. Writing for the same publication, Damian Bellino praised Emily's growth overall but dismissed the Berta subplot seemed \"false\", while Kelly Anderson lamented the loss of \"Emily firing people in every episode.\"\n\nStronger criticisms have endured; Amladi dismissed Emily's relationship with Berta and her family as \"a weaksauce commentary on immigrants moving in and taking over\", additionally criticizing the fact that she sells her large home in which they could have all lived comfortably in favor of moving them to a smaller beach house, accusing the character of treating them like objects. Despite having mostly praise for the character, \"Vanity Fair\"'s Laura Bradley dubbed Emily's treatment of Berta and her family \"racist\", referring to it as one of the character's \"more frustrating habits\" that were retained for the revival. However, Bradley acknowledged that some of Emily's \"coldness melts away\" as the character agrees to care for Berta. Anne Cohen of \"Refinery29\", who also had very positive opinions to share about Emily otherwise, called the subplot \"tired — and a bit racist\", but admitted that it allows Emily to exhibit compassion that she's rarely shown before. \"The Washington Post\"'s Emily Yahr wrote that the subplot \"seems out of place for a TV show in 2016.\"\n"}

{"id": "1973427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973427", "title": "Coat of arms of Norway", "text": "Coat of arms of Norway\n\nThe coat of arms of Norway is the arms of dominion of king Harald V of Norway, and as such represents both the monarch and the kingdom (nation and the state). It depicts a standing golden lion on a red background, bearing a golden crown and axe with silver blade (blazoned \"Gules, a lion rampant Or, crowned Or, holding an axe Or with a blade argent\").\n\nThe coat of arms is used by the King (including the King's Council), the Parliament, and the Supreme Court, which are the three powers according to the Constitution. It is also used by several national, regional, and local authorities that are subordinate to the aforementioned, for example the County Governors and both the district courts and the courts of appeal. Since 1905, two parallel versions exist: the more elaborate version used by the King and the simpler one used by the State. The arms in banner form serve as basis for the monarch's flag, known as the Royal Standard.\n\nIn addition, there are former and existing lands (e.g. the Earldom of Iceland and the Orkney Islands), cities (e.g. Kristiansand), organisations (e.g. the Museum of Cultural History), companies (e.g. Adresseavisen), and families (e.g. the Counts of Gyldenløve and Gudbrand Gregersen) who have been granted the right to bear the coat of arms or derivations of this. Unless officially granted, it is illegal to use the coat of arms.\n\nThe arms has its origin in the 13th century, at first just as a golden lion on a red shield, with the silver axe added late in the century, symbolising Olaf II as the Eternal King of Norway. In origin the arms of the Sverre dynasty, the coat of arms became quartered with that of the Bjälbo dynasty when the Sverre lineage was extinct in 1319, and the Sverre coat of arms figured as part of the further divisions of the coats of arms of Norwegian kings during the early modern period. \n\nThe Sverre coat of arms was regarded as representing the Norwegian monarchy in the late 15th century, and it came to be used to represent Norway on coins and in seals during the union with Denmark (1523−1814) and the 19th-century personal union with Sweden, its 13th-century origins placing it among the oldest state coats of arms which remain in contemporary use. The axe tended to be depicted as a curved pollaxe or halberd from 1500 until 1844. The 1844 design approved by king Oscar I reverted to the depiction of a battle-axe as shown in medieval designs. \n\nAfter the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905 a medieval-type escutcheon and charge was designed by Eilif Peterssen. Peterssen's design would be used until 1937 when it was re-designed by state archivist Hallvard Trætteberg, resulting in a markedly different, more simplified design style. Peterssen's design has, however, been retained in the Royal Standard and coat of arms.\n\nRoyal decree of 20 May 1927 states: The coat of arms of the Realm may be used only by the state's authorities in the exercise of their official activity. The coat of arms may be used by the Royal Court, by the government and its ministries, by the parliament, by the law courts, and by some others. Matters of the coat of arms are treated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The state coat of arms has no achievement save the surmounting crown.\n\nThe royal coat of arms is defined in the resolution of 30 December 1905. In the coat of arms of the realm, a heraldic royal crown is placed directly on top of the shield. In the royal coat of arms, the shield of the arms of the realm is on a mantle purple lined ermine with a royal crown on top. Three sides of the shield are surrounded by the collar of the Royal Order of St. Olaf.\n\nThe following coats of arms are displayed with the collar of the Order of St. Olaf. However, not all Princes and Princesses are Grand Cross holders or, for that sake, members of this order at all, wherefore their respective coats of arms do not include this achievement.\n\nThe Royal Standard of Norway is the Norwegian arms in banner form.\n\nAchievements including the royal arms:\nThe design of the coat of arms is derived from that of the Sverre dynasty. Hallvard Trætteberg in 1814 suggested that Sverre, who was king between 1184 and 1202, had a lion in his coat of arms, although there is no direct attestation. Snorre Sturlason claims that a golden lion on a red background was used already in 1103 by King Magnus III, the son of King Olav III. Gustav Storm in 1894 concluded that this is ahistorical. Storm explained that the claimed lion in King Magnus's coat of arms is unknown both in the older Saga literature and in other contemporary sources. It is possible that Snorre, who wrote under the instruction of the King, attributed King Sverre's coat of arms to earlier Kings of Norway.\n\nA lion is shown on the coat of arms in the seal of Earl Skule Bårdsson, dated 1225, who had relations to the royal family. \n\nHaakon Haakonson the Old had a lion in his seal, shown as lying between the feet of the seated king.\nA royal coat of arms with a lion is finally seen on the seal of Haakon Haakonson the Young, dated 1250.\n\nThe first instance of the lion bearing an axe is found in a seal of Eric II (1285).\n\nApproximately in 1280, either King Magnus VI (dead in 1280) or the guardianship of his son Eric Magnuson let the lion be equipped with a crown of gold and in the foremost paws an axe of silver. The axe was a symbol of Saint Olaf, i.e. King Olaf II, and by inserting it into the coat of arms it symbolised that the King was the rightful heir and descendant of the 'Eternal King of Norway' (Latin: \"Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae\").\n\nWith the death of King Haakon V in 1319, the reign of the Sverre dynasty came to an end. The Throne and thus the Royal Coat of Arms was inherited by Magnus VII, who was a maternal grandson of Haakon V and who himself belonged patrilineally to the family known as the Bjälbo dynasty.\n\nSubsequently, Norway remained in personal union with neighbouring countries. When acting as the ruler of one particular country, the sovereign would normally use the arms of that kingdom. When acting as sovereign of the united kingdoms, he would marshal the escutcheon by quartering. This was a tendency in Europe in general.\n\nThe first union kings placed the Royal Coat of Arms in the first quarter of the quartered coat of arms. At the beginning of the Kalmar Union, Norway as a hereditary kingdom was considered more important than Sweden and Denmark, which were still electoral kingdoms. Consequently, King Eric III of Pomerania placed his Norwegian Coat of Arms in an inescutcheon, superimposed on the coats of arms of his other realms. However, the Norwegian Coat of Arms would later be degraded, so that the Coat of arms of Denmark would occupy the first field, whilst Norway's was placed in the second.\n\nIn 1450, Count Christian of Oldenburg and of Delmenhorst became King of Norway. He was already King of Denmark since 1448, and in 1457, he became King of Sweden as well. Norway's coat of arms was placed in the lower dexter field and, when Sweden left the Kalmar Union in 1523, in the upper sinister field. The latter lasted until 1814.\n\nVarying from time to time, the Kings between 1450 and 1814 bore the coats of arms of the following kingdoms, peoples, and lands:\n\n\nOn 4 November 1814, the Norwegian Storting elected King Charles XIII of Sweden as King of Norway. This personal union with Sweden lasted until the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.\n\nWithout legitimate heirs of the body, King Charles adopted the French marshall Bernadotte, Prince of Pontecorvo, who took the name Carl Johan. \n\nThe union arms introduced by King Charles XIII and Crown Prince Carl Johan were never used officially in Norway. Only the lion coat of arms of Norway appeared on coins and on seals of official documents signed by the King in his capacity as Norwegian king.\n\nThe union arms introduced by King Oscar I in 1844 was used by members of the royal family, by the common diplomatic service of both kingdoms, and on official documents concerning both countries. In Norway, the union arms was never used on coins or official documents.\n\nIn Sweden, Crown Princes and Princes bore the coat of arms belonging to his duchy. See Duchies in Sweden (but these titles and arms were never used in Norway).\n\nThe halberd was officially discarded and the shorter axe reintroduced by Royal Order in Council 10 July 1844, when an authorised design was instituted for the first time. On 14 December 1905 the official design for royal and government arms was again changed, this time reverting to the medieval pattern, with a triangular escutcheon and a more upright heraldic lion. The painter Eilif Peterssen was responsible for the design.\n\nThrough centuries and following changing fashions in heraldry and arts, the coat of arms has appeared in several ways in the matter of design, shape, and so on. In the late Middle Ages, the axe handle gradually grew longer and came to resemble a halberd. The handle was usually curved in order to fit the shape of the escutcheon (or the changing union quarterings) preferred at the time, and also to match the shape of coins.\n\nThe coat of arms has also been used by subordinate state authorities and in semi-official contexts, such as on bank-notes.\n\n\n\n"}

While Kyle was initially excited about seeing his cousin for the first time, he is baffled to see that his cousin is none other than an overly stereotyped version of a Jew, wearing his hair in a style similar to Woody Allen, and has a lot of irritating characteristics. Kyle is told by his mother to take care of his cousin. Kyle, fearing that Cartman, a staunch anti-Semite, will \"tear this kid apart\", attempts to bribe Cartman with $40 to not make fun of him. Cartman, in an attempt to earn the bribe, struggles to avoid mocking Kyle's cousin, but eventually fails. The boys decide that Kyle's cousin is just way too irritating to live in South Park with them. Much of the episode proceeds to have the boys make constant attempts to get rid of Kyle Schwartz. In one attempt to trick him into boarding a plane to Antarctica, Kenny is mistaken for a terrorist and shot through the head. However, Kyle's cousin always finds a way to come back to South Park.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Garrison, annoyed and fed up with the inefficient and incompetent airline check-ins since 9/11, decides to invent his own vehicle. Inspired by watching Enrique Iglesias' sexualized singing on TV and by a gyroscope sitting next to him on his deck, he invents the gyroscope-powered monowheel \"IT\". According to Mr. Garrison, \"IT\" can \"go up to two hundred miles per hour, and gets three hundred miles to the gallon\". The only problem is that \"IT\" is controlled through a quite painful and unappealing method: using four \"flexi-grip handles\" that somewhat resemble erect penises; two held in the hands, one in the mouth, and a fourth handle which is inserted into the anus. Garrison invites many important investors to see his demonstration of \"IT\". Despite this unorthodox control mechanism, \"IT\" is still considered better than dealing with the airlines and Garrison's creation is a smashing success. This results in a lack of passengers and business in airports.\n\nUnfortunately, things go downhill when the government decides to bail out the airlines from going under because of \"IT\". To ensure the airlines' dominance as a mode of transport and the job security of everyone working for it, the government ends up outlawing \"IT\", deems using it a criminal act and confiscates all of the \"IT\" stock. As a result, Kyle's cousin, who turns out to have invested in \"IT\", gets a $5 million bailout payment and decides to return home to Connecticut to take care of his sick mother. After hearing of this great fortune, the boys suddenly change their plan and try to convince him to stay with them, but he rejects them.\n\nAccording to the creator commentary, the depiction of Kyle's cousin was partially based on their experience working with radio host Dennis Prager. The \"IT\" vehicle was based on the pre-release hype surrounding the Segway, which prior to its public reveal was known only by the code-name \"It\" and was the subject of much speculation. \n\n\"The Entity\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n"}

{"id": "1973460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973460", "title": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in Essex", "text": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in Essex\n\nThe county of Essex (which includes the unitary authorities of Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock)\nis divided into 18 Parliamentary constituencies (sub-classified into six of borough type and twelve of county status affecting the level of expenses permitted and status of returning officer). The county saw the majority of its population and seats removed on the creation of the county of Greater London in 1965. Since then, the Conservatives have won a majority of the seats in the revised county, with all of Essex's seats being won by Conservative MPs at the 2019 United Kingdom general election.\n\nFollowing the 2017 General Election, the Conservative Party made a net gain of one seat in Essex by gaining the seat of Clacton from UKIP. This also saw Thurrock become the most marginal seat in the county. 2017 was the first time since 1987 that Essex had returned a full slate of Conservative MPs.\n\nUntil 1965, with the creation of the county of Greater London, the county of Essex included the areas now represented by the Outer London Boroughs of Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Redbridge and Waltham Forest.\n\nSince 1295, the Parliamentary County of Essex, along with all other English Counties regardless of size or population, had elected 2 MPs to the House of Commons in accordance with the freehold property franchise. The county also included three Parliamentary Boroughs, namely Colchester, Harwich and Maldon all returning 2 MPs each.\n\nThe Great Reform Act of 1832 radically changed the representation of the House of Commons, with the County being divided into the Northern and Southern Divisions, both returning 2 MPs. The Parliamentary Boroughs each retained their 2 MPs.\n\nUnder the Reform Act of 1867, the county was further divided; the Northern Division was abolished and redistributed to the East and West Divisions, which both also included areas transferred from the Southern Division. The representation of the Boroughs of Harwich and Maldon was each reduced to 1 MP, maintaining the overall representation of the county at 10 MPs.\n\nUnder the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the three 2-member county divisions were replaced by eight single-member constituencies, namely the North Eastern or Harwich Division (which absorbed the abolished Parliamentary Borough of Harwich), the Eastern or Maldon Division (which absorbed the abolished Parliamentary Borough of Maldon), the South Eastern Division, the Mid or Chelmsford Division, the Northern or Saffron Walden Division, the Western or Epping Division, the South Western or Walthamstow Division and the Southern or Romford Division. The representation of the Borough of Colchester was reduced to 1 MP and West Ham was created as a new Parliamentary Borough, divided into North and South Divisions.\n\nThe two tables below show an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Essex since 1885. The text gives a more detailed description.\n\nNotes:\n\n\nUnder the Representation of the People Act 1918, the number of constituencies in Essex was increased substantially in the Outer London area to reflect the growth of the population since 1885. Walthamstow was split into four boroughs of Walthamstow East and West, and Leyton East and West, with Woodford being transferred to Epping; the Borough of West Ham was further divided into the four divisions of Stratford, Upton, Plaistow and Silvertown; and Romford was split into four with the creation of East Ham North and South, and Ilford, with Wanstead being transferred to Epping and the parish of Cann Hall being included in Leyton East. The much reduced constituency of Romford gained the then small villages of Upminster and Rainham from Chelmsford and South East Essex respectively.\n\nOutside Greater London, the number of constituencies was only increased by one with the creation of the Parliamentary Borough of Southend-on-Sea which was carved out of South East Essex. The Parliamentary Borough of Colchester was converted into a County Division, gaining western parts of Harwich. Other boundary changes included: Chipping Ongar from Epping to Chelmsford; Billericay from Chelmsford to South East Essex; Burnham-on-Crouch and the Dengie peninsular from South East Essex to Maldon; Halstead from Maldon to Saffron Walden; and Great Dunmow and Hatfield Broad Oak from Epping to Saffron Walden.\n\nThe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944 set up Boundaries Commissions to carry out periodic reviews of the distribution of parliamentary constituencies. It also authorised an initial review to subdivide abnormally large constituencies (those exceeding an electorate of 100,000) in time for the 1945 election. This was implemented by the Redistribution of Seats Order 1945 under which Essex was allocated six additional seats: Thurrock was carved out of South East Essex; Woodford (incorporating Woodford, Wanstead and Chigwell) was created from Epping; Ilford was split into North and South Divisions; and Romford (which had an electorate exceeding 200,000) was once again split into four constituencies with the creation of Barking, Dagenham and Hornchurch. The boundary between South East Essex and Chelmsford was redrawn to reflect the reorganisation of local authorities since 1918.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1948 reflected the reduction of population in the innermost parts of Outer London: West Ham's representation was reduced back down from four to two through the re-establishment of the North and South constituencies; and the two Leyton seats were combined to form the Leyton constituency. Outside London, the expanded Borough of Southend was split between East and West constituencies, with the former including Shoeburyness and Rochford, both previously in South East Essex, which was now renamed Billericay. The only other significant change was the transfer of the Urban District of Brentwood from Chelmsford to Romford.\n\nThe First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies resulted in the creation of Chigwell, primarily created from hiving off the Urban District of Chigwell from Woodford, but also including Chipping Ongar and surrounding rural areas, transferred from Chelmsford. In addition, South East Essex was re-established, comprising the Urban Districts of Benfleet, Canvey Island and Rayleigh, which were previously included in the Billericay constituency, along with Rochford, transferred back from Southend East. Billericay now comprised the Urban District of Billericay (renamed Basildon Urban District shortly afterwards), along with that of Brentwood, transferred from Romford.\n\nFollowing an interim review of boundaries in 1960, Woodford was renamed Wanstead and Woodford with effect from the 1964 general election.\n\nOn 1 April 1965, the south-western corner of the county of Essex was incorporated into the new county of Greater London, resulting in the majority of the electorate and parliamentary constituencies being removed. The constituency of Epping was split, with the area comprising the former Urban District of Chingford being included in the new London Borough of Waltham Forest.\nThe next national boundary change, following the recommendations of the Second Periodic Review, reflected the change in county boundaries arising from the creation of Greater London in 1965, but did not come into effect for a further nine years at the February 1974 election. The impact on the constituencies within the re-constituted county of Essex were as follows:\n\n\nHarwich, Colchester, Southend East, Southend West and Thurrock were unchanged.\n\nThe Third Review reflected the 1974 local government reorganisation arising from the Local Government Act 1972 and resulted in another significant redistribution, including the addition of two more seats:\n\n\nIn addition to losing parts to Rochford, Chelmsford lost a small rural area to Brentwood and Ongar but gained a small area from Braintree. Other minor adjustments to take account of changes to local authority ward boundaries.\n\nThe Fourth Review saw another increase in the number of constituencies, with the creation the constituency of North Essex, which had significant knock-on effects as described below.\n\nNorth Essex was created from mainly rural areas of the abolished constituencies of North Colchester, and South Colchester and Maldon, but excluding the urban area comprising the town of Colchester, which was formed as the re-established seat of Colchester, now constituted as a Borough Constituency. it also included a further small slice of the western part of Harwich. Maldon was now combined with eastern parts of the Borough of Chelmsford, transferred primarily from the abolished constituency of Chelmsford, creating the new constituency of Maldon and East Chelmsford. The remainder of the Chelmsford constituency, including the bulk of the city, formed the new constituency of West Chelmsford, which also included remaining rural areas in the north of the Chelmsford Borough which were previously included in the Braintree constituency.\n\nElsewhere, the town of Rochford was transferred from the constituency of Rochford to Southend East, which required them to be renamed Raleigh and Rochford and Southend East respectively; there was a major realignment of the boundaries between Basildon and Billericay with the former gaining the northern part of the Borough of Thurrock from the latter, in exchange for the town of Pitsea; and there were minor transfers from Harlow to Epping Forest (North Weald Bassett), and from Saffron Walden to Braintree.\n\nUnder the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the Boundary Commission for England increased Essex's representation again, with the creation of the constituency of Witham.\n\nApproximately half of the new constituency came from the Braintree constituency, including the town of Witham itself, with parts also transferred from Colchester, North Essex and Maldon and East Chelmsford. North Essex now included the town of Harwich from the Harwich constituency, resulting in revised names of Harwich and North Essex and Clacton.\n\nTo compensate for the loss of Witham, Braintree was expanded northwards, taking the District of Braintree wards (including the town of Halstead) which had been in Saffron Waldon, which in turn took northern, rural parts of the Borough of Chelmsford from the abolished constituency of West Chelmsford. The built-up area of the city of Chelmsford now formed the re-established seat of Chelmsford, reconstituted as a borough constituency. This seat included the eastern suburbs previously in Maldon and East Chelmsford which was abolished; the re-established constituency of Maldon took remaining parts, adding southern areas of the Borough of Chelmsford (including South Woodham Ferrers), primarily from the Rayleigh constituency.\n\nRayleigh gained the town of Wickford from Billericay and was renamed Rayleigh and Wickford. The Billericay and Basildon constituencies were completely re-organised yet again, into the renamed constituencies of Basildon and Billericay and South Basildon and East Thurrock. The former included the town of Billericay, combined with central parts of Basildon, and the latter included southern suburbs of Basildon, Pitsea and northern and eastern areas of the Borough of Thurrock, including East Tilbury, which was transferred from the constituency of Thurrock.\n\nFinally, North Weald Bassett was now transferred from Epping Forest to Brentwood and Ongar.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Essex in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\n1974 & 1979 - Liberal Party; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\n1974 & 1979 - Liberal Party; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nA cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\nKey: bulk or all of areas marked † form part of present-day Greater London.\n\n"}

{"id": "1973470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973470", "title": "Fuzzy concept", "text": "Fuzzy concept\n\nA fuzzy concept is a concept of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all. This means the concept is vague in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether. It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called \"fuzzy semantics\". The inverse of a \"fuzzy concept\" is a \"crisp concept\" (i.e. a precise concept).\n\nA fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is \"to an extent applicable\" in a situation. That means the concept has \"gradations\" of significance or \"unsharp\" (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true \"to some extent\", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber traffic light, and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems. The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is \"rather vague\" for any kind of reason.\n\nIn the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about \"variations on a theme\" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.\n\nThe new neuro-fuzzy computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision. It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.\n\nProblems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience. The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.\n\nThe ancient Sorites paradox first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference. With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100 °C or 212 °F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes).\n\nWith many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be \"unsharp\": we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly.\n\nAccording to the modern idea of the continuum fallacy, the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.\n\nThe Nordic myth of Loki's wager suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all. However, the 20th-century idea of \"fuzzy concepts\" proposes that \"somewhat vague terms\" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.\n\nThe intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers, including (among many others) Eubulides, Plato, Cicero, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hugh MacColl, Charles S. Peirce, Max Black, Jan Łukasiewicz, Emil Leon Post, Alfred Tarski, Georg Cantor, Nicolai A. Vasiliev, Kurt Gödel, Stanisław Jaśkowski and Donald Knuth.\n\nAcross at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with \"fuzzy\" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to \"analyze\" the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of many-valued logic or substructural logic.\n\nAn early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset. However, at the time, their idea \"fell on stony ground\". J. Barkley Rosser Sr. published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating \"many-valued sets\". Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others\n\nIn 1964, the American philosopher William Alston introduced the term \"degree vagueness\" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to \"combinatory vagueness\" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).\n\nThe German mathematician Dieter Klaua published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965, but he used a different terminology (he referred to \"many-valued sets\", not \"fuzzy sets\").\n\nTwo popular introductions to many-valued logic in the late 1960s were by Robert J. Ackermann and Nicholas Rescher respectively. Rescher's book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf for 1966-1974. Haack provides references to significant works after 1974. Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning.\n\nUsually the Iranian-born American computer scientist Lotfi A. Zadeh (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a \"fuzzy concept\" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.<ref>Lotfi A. Zadeh, \"Fuzzy sets\". In: \"Information and Control\", Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.\n\n"}

It became a diocese of the Episcopal Church in 1836, one year before the State of Michigan entered the Union. Initially encompassing the entire Michigan Territory, it split several times to reflect a growing population, and now comprises only the densely populated southeastern portion of the state.\n\nSt. Paul's, Detroit was formally designated the cathedral of the diocese in 1912.\n\nAt its foundation, one year before Michigan achieved statehood, the Diocese encompassed all of Michigan. As the church grew the bishops found it difficult to administer such a large area, and the parishes farther from Detroit desired a bishop closer to their own areas and more attuned to their local needs. To address these concerns, the diocese has divided three times. In 1875, the western half of the Lower Peninsula became the Diocese of Western Michigan. In 1895, the Upper Peninsula became the Diocese of Marquette (later renamed Diocese of Northern Michigan). Finally in 1995, the northeastern Lower Peninsula, Saginaw Valley, and Thumb areas (the northern two-thirds of its then remaining territory) became the Diocese of Eastern Michigan. As a result of these divisions, the current Diocese of Michigan includes only the Detroit Metropolitan Area and adjacent regions as far west as Lansing, Jackson, and Hillsdale.\n\nOfficially, the diocesan boundaries are as follows:\n\nThe Counties of Hillsdale, Lenawee, Monroe, Jackson, Washtenaw, Wayne, Ingham, Livingston, Oakland (except for Holly Township), Macomb and that portion of Clinton County south of Price Road\n\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Michigan was organized In the fall of 1832 by parishes in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Troy, Monroe, Ypsilanti and Tecumseh. It became the 21st diocese of the Episcopal Church of the United States. From its beginning, St. Paul’s Church in Detroit (the current Cathedral) served, initially informally until the formal designation in 1912, as the see of the diocese, and the early bishops served as rector of St. Paul’s.\n\nIn the 1800s, the diocese focused on rapidly spreading the gospel to the region. As early as the 1840s, the church began to develop urban missions in Detroit to African Americans (St. Matthew’s) and laborers (Mariners’ Church). The 1850s saw the development of missions in the Saginaw Valley and Upper Peninsula. Supporting churches in poor farming areas was a focus during this period.\n\nThe major emphasis of the diocese changed in the 1900s as the automobile industry began to prosper in Michigan. Throughout the century the financial stability of the diocese were closely tied to the development and decline of the industry in the Detroit area. The rapid rise in Detroit’s wealth and power in the 1910s and 1920s were reflected in a diocese that became one of the largest and most influential in The Episcopal Church. The suburbanization of the 1940s and 1950s led to a focus on the physical expansion in the diocese with the addition of new church buildings. The decline of Detroit in the 1970s and 1980s saw the diocese cutting back and closing parishes.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Bishop Charles D. Williams led the diocese to discuss the church’s responsibility to the labor movement. Later Bishops Richard S. M. Emrich and Harry Coleman McGehee, Jr. began community activism around the issues of civil rights, peace, and justice. Beginning in the 1950s, the diocese debated the role of women, and later gays and lesbians, in the church.\n\nSince 1920 the executive council (since 1995 called diocesan council) has met between conventions to continue its policy-making role. The standing committee provides advice and counsel for the bishop. Since 1875 the trustees of the diocese have managed the diocesan assets. The chancellor has since 1904 provided the bishop with legal counsel. The parishes in the diocese have been divided into regional groupings called at various times convocations, archdeaconries, area councils, and currently deaneries, that have varied over the years in number, names, and responsibilities.\n\nThe current bishop is the Right Reverend Wendell Gibbs, one of only a few African-American bishops in the Episcopal Church. Succeeding his retirement in 2020 will be the Right Reverend Bonnie Perry . Its first bishop was Samuel Allen McCoskry, who served 1836-1878.\n\n"}

Grado is the birthplace of Biagio Marin, a poet who sang about the island in the local Venetian dialect.\n\nIn Roman times the city, known as \"ad Aquae Gradatae\", was first port for ships entering the Natissa (Natisone), headed upstream to Aquileia.\n\nDuring the late years of the Western Roman Empire many people fled from Aquileia to Grado in order to find a safer place, more protected from the invasions coming from the east. In 452, Nicetas, Bishop of Aquileia, took refuge briefly at Grado; of the same period is the earliest construction of Grado's first cathedral, the first church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and the baptistery. Grado was the home base of the patriarchate's fleet.\n\nIn 568, after the invasion of the Lombards, the seat of the Patriarchate of Aquileia was transferred to Grado by the Patriarch Paulinus. After the Schism of the Three Chapters, two different patriarchs were elected: the patriarch of Grado exerted his jurisdiction over the Latin-origin people living on the coast and in the Venetian Lagoon, while that of Old-Aquileia, later moved to Cividale, had its jurisdiction over the interior. A long-lasting dispute over the authority of the two patriarchs ensued. In 993, the patriarch of Aquileia, Popo, conquered Grado, but was unable to keep possession of it. The matter was settled only in 1027 when the pope declared the supremacy of the See of Aquileia over Grado and the Venetian province.\n\nThe seat of the patriarchate was transferred to Venice in 1451 by Pope Nicholas V. Reduced to a minor hamlet, Grado was sacked by the English, who burned the city archives in 1810 and by the French in 1812. Grado was acquired by Austria in 1815, to which it belonged until 1918, when it was ceded to Italy after its victory in World War I.\n\nToday there are frequent finds of inscriptions, sarcophagi, marble sculpture and small bronzes that once furnished its villas. The remains of one of these villas have been excavated on the islet of Gorgo in the lagoon.\n\nModern landmarks include:\n\nOf the ancient fortress only a tower, turned into a private residence, and parts of the walls can still be seen. Under the Town Hall are remains of the Palaeo-Christian basilica of Piazza Vittoria.\n\nThe Valle Cavanata Nature Reserve is a protected area situated in the easternmost part of the Grado Lagoon.\n\nToday, Grado attracts scores of tourists each year to its hotels and campgrounds. A large water park run by a municipal corporation is the main attraction, complete with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a health center offering spa treatments.\n\nThe town also boasts a well-preserved pedestrian-only center, in which many shops, bars, and restaurants are located.\n\nGrado also offers facilities for many sporting activities, including tennis, wind-surfing, and golf. From Grado can be done excursions by boat to the Grado Lagoon, and visit the many dozen islands inside it (like Barbana).\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

W. Greg, was one of the leading bibliographers and Shakespeare scholars of the 20th century.\n\nGreg was born at Wimbledon Common in 1875. His father, William Rathbone Greg, was an essayist; his mother was the daughter of James Wilson. As a child, Greg was expected one day to assume editorship of \"The Economist\", which his grandfather had founded in 1843; Greg was educated at Wixenford, Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he met Ronald McKerrow, whose friendship helped shape Greg's decision to pursue a career in literature. While still in school he compiled a list of Renaissance plays printed before 1700, and he joined the Bibliographical Society the same year. He was President of the Society from 1930 to 1932 and received its Gold Medal in 1935.\n\nAfter school, Greg settled into a life of steady productivity, while living on the proceeds of his shares of \"The Economist\". Working in close association with A. H. Bullen, he produced \"Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama\" (1906), the first edited version of the account books of Philip Henslowe (1906–8) and the papers of Edward Alleyn. The latter two works provided him with a knowledge of Renaissance theatrical conditions perhaps rivaled only by E. K. Chambers, and this knowledge he applied to the publications of the Malone Society, which he served as general editor between 1906 and 1939. He served as Librarian of Trinity College, 1907–13, resigning after his marriage to his cousin Elizabeth Gaskell. \n\nAs an independent scholar, Greg produced editions of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (1910), Robert Greene's \"Orlando Furioso\" and George Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\" (published together, 1923), and \"Sir Thomas More\" (1911). He returned to specific editing with work on \"Doctor Faustus\" (1950). Greg also wrote on the material conditions of Renaissance theater and publishing; his work in this regard includes \"Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses\" (1931) and \"English Literary Autographs, 1550–1650\" (1932). \"The Variants in the First Quarto of King Lear\" (1940) offered a careful examination of this printing. He also wrote hundreds of reviews, including a notably caustic rejection of J. Churton Collins's 1905 Oxford edition of Robert Greene.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, Greg moved to Sussex, where he spent the war working on his edition of \"Faustus.\" In addition, he began to prepare his great works of the 1950s: \"The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare\" (1951), \"The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History\" (1955), \"Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing, 1550–1650\" (1954), and the essay \"The rationale of copy-text\" (1950), which had a significant influence on textual criticism. He was Lyell Reader in Bibliography at Oxford University, 1954–5. Greg was knighted in the 1950 King's Birthday Honours List.\n\nGreg was strongly associated with Alfred W. Pollard in developing a modern understanding of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts. His greatest achievement is \"A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration,\" published in four volumes between 1939 and 1959.\n\n\n"}

Fisher Unwin in 1908. It is the first novel of the \"Blue Lagoon\" trilogy, which also includes \"The Garden of God\" (1923) and \"The Gates of Morning\" (1925). The novel has inspired several film adaptations, most notably \"The Blue Lagoon\" starring Brooke Shields as Emmeline and Christopher Atkins as Richard (\"Dicky\" in the book), in which they are two fictional English children.\n\nThe story centers on two cousins, Dicky and Emmeline Lestrange, who are marooned with a galley cook on an island in the South Pacific following a shipwreck. The galley cook, Paddy Button, assumes responsibility for the children and teaches them how to survive, cautioning them to avoid the \"arita\" berries, which he calls \"the never-wake-up berries\".\n\nTwo-and-a-half years after the shipwreck, Paddy dies following a drinking binge. The children survive on their resourcefulness and the bounty of their remote paradise. They live in a hut and spend their days fishing, swimming, diving for pearls and exploring the island.\n\nAs the years pass, Dicky and Emmeline grow into physically mature young adults and begin to fall in love. Ignorant of their human sexuality, they do not understand or know how to express their physical attraction to one another. Eventually, they consummate their relationship. The author, Henry De Vere Stacpoole, describes their sexual encounter as having been \"conducted just as the birds conduct their love affairs. An affair absolutely natural, absolutely blameless and without sin. It was a marriage according to nature, without feast or guests.\"\nDicky becomes very attentive toward Emmeline, listening to her stories and bringing her gifts. Over several months they make love often and eventually Emmeline becomes pregnant. The couple does not understand the physical changes happening to Emmeline's body and have no knowledge of childbirth. When the day comes for delivery, Emmeline disappears into the forest and returns with a child. They discover over time that the baby requires a name and they call him \"Hannah\" because they have only ever known an infant called by that name.\n\nDicky and Emmeline teach Hannah how to swim, fish, throw spears and play in the mud. They survive a violent tropical cyclone and other natural hazards of island life.\n\nBack in San Francisco, Arthur, Dicky's father and Emmeline's uncle, believes the two are still alive and is determined to find them, after recognizing a child's tea set belonging to Emmeline which was retrieved by a whaler on an island. Arthur finds a captain willing to take him to the island and they set out.\n\nMeanwhile, Dicky, Emmeline and Hannah row their lifeboat to the place where they had once lived with Paddy as children. Emmeline breaks a branch off the deadly arita plant as Dicky cuts bananas on the shore. While in the boat with her son, Emmeline fails to notice that Hannah has tossed one of the oars into the sea. The tide comes in and sweeps the boat into the lagoon, leaving Emmeline and Hannah stranded. As Dicky swims to them, he is pursued by a shark. Emmeline strikes the shark with the remaining oar, earning Dicky time to climb into the boat safely.\n\nAlthough they are not far from shore, the trio cannot get back without the oars and they are unable to retrieve them from the water because of the shark. The boat is then caught in the current and drifts out to sea; all the while Emmeline still grasps the arita branch.\n\nSometime later, Arthur's ship comes across the lifeboat and finds the three unconscious but still breathing. The arita branch is now bare save for one berry. Arthur asks, \"Are they dead?\" and the captain replies, \"No, sir. They are asleep\". The ambiguous ending leaves it uncertain whether or not they can be revived.\n\n\nFour films have been based on this novel:\n\n\n"}

Stadials are periods of colder climate while interstadials are periods of warmer climate. \n\nEach Quaternary climate phase is associated with a Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) number, which describe alternation between warmer and cooler temperatures as measured by oxygen isotope data. Stadials have even MIS numbers and interstadials odd MIS numbers. The current Holocene interstadial is MIS 1 and the Last glacial maximum stadial is MIS 2. \n\nMarine Isotope Stages are sometimes further subdivided into stadials and interstadials by minor climate fluctuations within the overall stadial or interstadial regime, which are indicated by letters. The odd-numbered interstadial MIS 5, also known as the Sangamonian interglacial, contains two periods of relative cooling, and so is subdivided into three interstadials (5a, 5c, 5e) and two stadials (5b, 5d). A stadial isotope stage like MIS 6 would be subdivided by periods of relative warming, and so in that case the first and last subdivisions would be stadials; MIS 6a, 6c and 6e are stadials while 6b and 6d are interstadials.\n\nGenerally, stadials endure for a thousand years or less, and interstadials for less than ten thousand years, while interglacials last for more than ten thousand and glacials for about one hundred thousand. \n\nWhile the MIS 1 interstadial encompasses the entirety of the present Holocene interglacial, the Wisconsin glaciation encompasses MIS 2, 3, and 4.\n\nGlacials and Interglacials refer to the 100kyr cycles associated with Milankovitch cycles, while stadials and interstadials are defined by the actual oxygen-isotope temperature record.\n\nThe Bølling Oscillation and the Allerød Oscillation, where they are not clearly distinguished in the stratigraphy, are taken together to form the Bølling/Allerød interstadial, and dated from about 14,700 to 12,700 years before the present.\n\nThe Oldest, Older, and Younger Dryas are three stadials that occurred during the warming since the Last Glacial Maximum. The Older Dryas occurred between the Bølling and Allerød interstadials. All three periods are named for the arctic plant species, Dryas octopetala, which proliferated during these cold periods.\n\nGreenland ice cores show 24 interstadials during the one hundred thousand years of the Wisconsin glaciation. Referred to as the Dansgaard-Oeschger events, they have been extensively studied, and in their northern European contexts are sometimes named after towns, such as the Brorup, the Odderade, the Oerel, the Glinde, the Hengelo, or the Denekamp.\n\n"}

{"id": "1973575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973575", "title": "Renovation", "text": "Renovation\n\nRenovations (also called remodeling) is the process of improving a broken, damaged, or outdated structure. Renovations are typically either commercial or residential. Additionally, renovation can refer to making something new, or bringing something back to life and can apply in social contexts. For example, a community can be renovated if it is strengthened and revived.\n\nThe renovation process can usually be broken down into several processes:\nTechnology has had a meaningful impact on the renovation process, increasing the significance and strength of the planning stage. The availability of free online design tools has improved visualization of the changes, at a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional interior designer. The decision regarding changes is also influenced by the purpose of renovation. In case of a fix and flip objective, an ROI (return on investment) can result from changes to fix a structural issue or design flow yield or to use light and color to make rooms appear more spacious.\n\nMany people renovate homes to create a new appearance for their home, or so another person can live in the residence. Builders often renovate homes because it is a stable source of income.\n\nWood is versatile and flexible, making it the easiest construction material for renovations, and wood buildings can be redesigned to suit changing needs. Few homeowners or professional remodellers possess the skill and equipment that is required to alter steel-frame or concrete structures.\n\nForest certification verifies that wood products have been sourced from well-managed forests. Most certification programs provide online search options so that consumers can find certified products—the Certification Canada program includes a search option for all of the certification programs that are in use in Canada.\n\nIn North America, most structures are demolished because of external forces such as zoning changes and rising land values. Additionally, buildings that cannot be modified to serve the functional needs of the occupants are subject to demolition. Very few buildings on the continent are demolished due to structural degradation.\nThe Athena Institute surveyed 227 commercial and residential buildings that were demolished in St. Paul, Minnesota, between 2000 and mid-2003. Thirty percent of the buildings were less than 50 years old, and 6% were less than 25 years old. The four top reasons for demolition were “area redevelopment” (35%), “building’s physical condition” (31%), “not suitable for anticipated use” (22%), and “fire damage” (7%). Lack of maintenance was cited as the specific problem for 54 of the 70 buildings where physical condition was given as the reason for demolition.\n\nMost builders focus on building new homes, so renovating is typically a part-time activity for such tradespeople. The processes and services required for renovations are quite specific and, once plans are signed off, building a new home is relatively predictable. Renovations usually require all of the sub-trades that are needed for the construction of a new building. During renovation projects, flexibility is often required from renovation companies to respond to unexpected issues that arise. Projects involving renovation require not just flexibility, but a plan that had been agreed upon by multiple parties. The planning process will involve feedback from financial investors of the project, and from the designer. Part of planning will also entail the collection of data for the completion of the project and then the project plan will be revised and given consent before continuing with renovations.\n\nRenovation has several impacts, including:\n\n"}

It was released on 9 October 2000 by record label Hut.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: \"Taste in Men\", \"Slave to the Wage\", \"Special K\" and \"Black-Eyed\". The album reached number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, and received a generally favourable reaction from music critics.\n\nSpeaking to \"Kerrang!\" in June 2009, Brian Molko remembered: We had a real swagger and bravado when we went into the studio for this one. We had just come off a really successful tour and felt we'd really exploded. We felt like cowboys of rock! We were also really heavily medicated and beginning to get quite deep into drugs. That's probably why it took nine months to make an album. The drugs also contributed to a certain amount of arrogance. At least that's what I remember from the time. I think we had a desire to write about the world we saw around us. We thought it was cool that, though other people were a little afraid to get deep down and dirty, we could take it on ourselves to write about those things. I think that album was the start of us trying to mix genres. We had so much hatred for rap-rock bands like Limp Bizkit and all they represented – misogyny, homophobia and commercialism – that we wanted to do our own version of it.\n\nThe album is dedicated to music publicist Scott Piering, who died of cancer in early 2000. The song \"Commercial for Levi\" is a reference to the sound technician Levi Tecofski, who on one occasion saved frontman Brian Molko's life: Molko, drunk and about to cross the road, was quickly pulled back by Tecofski from the path of an approaching vehicle.\n\n\"Black Market Music\" was released on 9 October 2000. It reached number 6 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"Black Market Music\" received a generally favourable critical response, though a less enthusiastic reception than previous records. Dean Carlson of AllMusic wrote that \"\"Black Market Music\" finds Molko in such moody lust that his strangled, androgynous wailing rivals anything the band has previously flashed to the world [...] Placebo seem to have finally found that sweet wet spot between beauty and perversion.\" Dale Price of Drowned in Sound called it \"a heavily revised upgrade of their back catalogue. And then some.\" Nicholas Taylor of PopMatters called it \"highly listenable dark guitar rock\".\n\nAmong its detractors were \"NME\", who called it \"a case of ambition eclipsing talent, of hubris, of a band losing the plot. Placebo's frame of reference has always been narrow, but they've now been reduced to empty gestures without any visionary tunes to tip the balance.\"\n\nBrian Molko ranked this as his least favourite Placebo album.\n\nPlacebo\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nTechnical\n"}

Technically the fact that Lenham is \"allowed\" a market, makes it a town but the community have always desired to maintain its village status.\n\nThe High Street has a number of listed buildings.\n\nMary Honywood was born in Lenham. When she died in Essex at the age of 93, she had 367 living descendants.\n\nThe Pilgrims' Way/North Downs Way passes along the downland ridge to the north of Lenham. Between this ridge and the village lies a chalk cross carved into the scarp slope. First constructed in 1922, to remember those who fell in the Great War, and fully restored in 1994, the cross now commemorates the dead of both world wars. To avoid its use as a navigation aid by the Luftwaffe, the cross was filled in between 1939 and May 1945.\n\nOn 27 August 1950, Lenham, along with the village of Harvel, was one of the signal receiving points (between Calais and London) of the first-ever live television pictures from the continent.\n\nThe parish church of St Mary was rebuilt in the 14th century after fire had destroyed its predecessor. It and the nearby Tithe Barn are Grade I listed buildings. From 1876 to his death in 1903, the vicar of the church was Charles Nepean, who played for Oxford University A.F.C. in the 1874 FA Cup Final. Nepean also played cricket for Middlesex.\n\nThere is a primary school, Lenham Primary and a secondary school, The Lenham School, at Lenham. A pair of cottages in Lenham had to be demolished to make way for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Maidstone Line). They were dismantled and re-erected at the Museum of Kent Life, Sandling.\n\nA local kit car firm GKD Sports Cars has its workshop based in Lenham and its main base in Boughton Monchelsea. \n\nAlso in Lenham is a pharmacy, famous as the discovery site of a sixth century Saxon warrior body and weapons.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973585", "title": "STS-118", "text": "STS-118\n\nSTS-118 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by the orbiter \"Endeavour\". STS-118 lifted off on 8 August 2007 from launch pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida and landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC on 21 August 2007.\n\nThis was the first flight of \"Endeavour\" since STS-113 in November 2002, which was also the last successful shuttle flight before STS-107 which culminated in the loss of \"Columbia\" when it disintegrated during reentry. STS-118 pilot Charles Hobaugh had been the entry team CAPCOM for STS-107. \"Columbia\" had originally been selected for this flight, for what would have been its 29th mission, and its first and likely only visit to the ISS, mainly due to its heavier weight.\n\nThe mission is also referred to as ISS-13A.1 by the ISS program. The mission added two more components to the ISS and brought supplies for its crew.\n\nDuring and after the mission, the media focused heavily on a small puncture in the heat shield, created by a piece of insulation foam that came off the external tank during liftoff, though the foam impact that ultimately destroyed \"Columbia\" caused more damage and was in a critical area. KSC Launch Director Michael D. Leinbach mentioned in the post-flight news conference that upon initial inspection on the ground, \"\"Endeavour\" appears to be the 'cleanest' post-flight orbiter since Return to Flight\". On 31 August 2007, NASA reported that the damaged tiles had been removed in the Orbiter Processing Facility, and engineers had found no evidence of heat-related damage to the orbiter itself.\n\nAstronaut Clayton Anderson originally was slated to be launched to the ISS on this mission, but was moved to STS-117. His replacement was Alvin Drew.\n\nNASA press releases and media briefing documents stated that STS-118 was the first flight of a Mission Specialist Educator due to the presence of Barbara Morgan. The Educator Astronaut Project is the successor to NASA's Teacher in Space Project, which ended with the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster in 1986. Also, the official STS-118 mission patch included a flame of knowledge that represented the importance of education, and honored teachers and students everywhere. The tip of the flames touched Morgan's name on the patch. However, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin clarified at a post-mission press conference that Morgan was not considered a Mission Specialist Educator, but rather a standard Mission Specialist, who had once been a teacher.\n\nPrior to the \"Columbia\" disaster, the crew manifest for STS-118 was:\nThe STS-118 mission delivered and assembled the starboard S5 truss segment of the International Space Station, as well as External Stowage Platform 3, (ESP-3) and a replacement Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG). The mission was also the final flight to include the Spacehab Logistics Single Module.\n\nThe Spacehab Logistics Single Module, a pressurized aluminum habitat that is carried inside the payload bay, has a capacity of , and carried a variety of cargo and research projects, including supply materials for the ISS. It returned cargo, including the MISSE PEC 3 & 4, a Department of Defense payload that had been installed on the ISS. Launched in July 2006, the MISSE PEC-3 and 4 contained over 850 materials specimens that will be studied to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the environment of space.\n\nThe mission was originally scheduled to be flown by \"Columbia\"; STS-118 would have marked that orbiter's 29th flight and its first visit to the International Space Station. However, the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" disaster altered the planned flight schedules, and the mission was rescheduled for \"Endeavour\". STS-118 served as \"Endeavour\"'s return to flight after a planned orbiter re-fit and maintenance period that resulted in over 200 modifications to the orbiter.\n\nOne of the most important modifications that debuted during STS-118 is an upgraded power-distribution module, the Station-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS). SSPTS allows \"Endeavour\" to tap into the ISS power supply, converting up to eight kilowatts of electrical power from 120-volts direct-current (120VDC) ISS main voltage to the 28VDC system used by the orbiter. SSPTS was outfitted to the ISS Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA2) during STS-116. These upgrades will allow orbiters to remain docked at the station for an additional three to four mission days by saving cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to run the fuel cells which generate electricity aboard the orbiter; oxygen and hydrogen tank capacity is a major factor limiting the duration of orbiter free flights. Other systems debuting on this flight were a three-string GPS system, which replaces the three Tactical Air Navigation-units, used to guide the shuttle and calculate its position during reentry and landing and the new Advanced Health Management System which keeps an eye on the three main engines (SSMEs) during liftoff and will shut them down before any catastrophic damage might develop. (All SSMEs had their own computers to regulate, monitor, and shut them down in case of trouble; the new system extends and improves the monitoring capability for increased safety.) \"Endeavour\" also received several systems that the other orbiters had already been equipped with, such as a glass cockpit, improved wing leading-edge sensors and the OBSS.\n\nSTS-118 included mission specialist Barbara Morgan, the first Mission Specialist Educator. Morgan trained as the backup to Christa McAuliffe, NASA's Teacher in Space candidate from 1985 to 1986. McAuliffe was killed in the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster on 28 January 1986. While McAuliffe and Morgan were classified as spaceflight participants and not as mission specialists in 1986, after the Teacher in Space Project was canceled, Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee and continued to work with NASA's Education Division until her selection as NASA's first Mission Specialist Educator in 1998. Morgan completed two years of training and evaluation and began official duties in 2000. An Educator Astronaut is a fully trained astronaut who performs all the same duties that a regular astronaut does. Morgan became the first Mission Specialist Educator in space on STS-118, and will share what she learned from the experience with students during and after her flight.\n\nThe mission marked:\n\n\"Endeavour\" (OV-105) was moved from the Orbiter Processing Facility, bay OPF-2 to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 2 July 2007. On 10 July 2007, \"Endeavour\" moved from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39A. Moving at less than one mile per hour (/h) atop the crawler-transporter, the move began at 20:10 EDT, and was \"hard down\" (secured in place at the pad) at 03:02 EDT, 11 July 2007.\n\nThe crew completed the terminal countdown demonstration test on 19 July 2007, and the Flight Readiness Review meetings were held on 25–26 July 2007, after which NASA managers declared STS-118 a \"GO\" for launch. The launch was delayed one day to repair a valve in the shuttle's crew cabin pressurization system.\n\nCommander Kelly and the crew arrived at Kennedy Space Center on 3 August 2007, for final launch preparations. The countdown clock began at 20:00 EDT 5 August 2007, for the launch at 18:36 EDT on 8 August 2007.\n\nFueling of the external tank began at 08:11 EDT (12:11 UTC) and finished around 11:00 EDT. The Ice Team began their inspection of the orbiter to ensure no ice was on the orbiter or the fuel tank, something unlikely due to the unusually warm conditions as launch time approached. Their inspection concluded about 40 minutes quicker than the usual two hour duration. The crew departed for the Operations & Checkout (O&C) building, for the launch pad at 14:46 EDT (18:46 UTC), and arrived at the pad at 15:02 EDT (19:02 UTC). Launch occurred at 18:36:42 EDT (22:36:42 UTC).\n\nCountdown and launch notes:\n\nThe primary TAL site was Zaragoza Airport in Spain.\n\nFollowing the procedures for post-ascent, the crew opened the payload bay doors, activated the Spacehab, powered up the Remote Manipulator System, and performed a variety of other payload activation procedures, before entering their scheduled sleep shift at 04:36 UTC (12:36 am EDT) 9 August 2007.\n\nThe shuttle crew spent most of the day inspecting the outer hull and the heat shield. During the mission status briefing, Deputy Shuttle Program Manager (and Mission Management Team chairman) John Shannon reported that during launch, approximately nine pieces of foam were observed breaking off the external fuel tanks. Three of these struck the shuttle. All three strikes are considered to be minor in nature.\n\n\"Endeavour\" successfully docked with the International Space Station at 18:02 UTC (14:02 EDT). Approximately an hour before docking, \"Endeavour\" performed the one-degree-per-second backflip, called the Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver (RPM), so the ISS crew members could take digital pictures of the heat shield of the orbiter. The images were then analyzed by NASA's Image Analysis Team, as well as the Mission Management Team to inspect the integrity of the orbiter's heat shield. Following a series of leak checks, the hatches were opened at 20:04 UTC (16:04 EDT), and the Expedition 15 crew welcomed the STS-118 crew aboard the station.\n\nAfter preliminary review of the photos taken by the Expedition 15 crew during the RPM, an area of interest was discovered on the underside of the Shuttle; an area behind the right landing gear door covered with black silica tiles. The tile directly aft of the door had a by gouge in it. While the tile was penetrated, the underlying felt backing was not. NASA noted in the press conference that launch-time video confirmed a foam strike. This area is less critical than the leading-edge reinforced carbon-carbon tiles that were damaged in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, but did cause concern for the Mission Management Team. A focused inspection was scheduled for 12 August 2007 to determine whether a patch attempt would be undertaken by the astronauts during an EVA. NASA once reported that pieces of foam are bound to, and have fallen off of the external tank during the eight and a-half minute ride to orbit. An unprecedented three-hundred pieces of foam once struck the underside of an orbiter during launch.\n\nThe crew activated the Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) after docking. The SSPTS transfers electrical power from the station to the shuttle, allowing the shuttle to conserve its own power generating resources. An extension of the mission from 11 to 14 days was dependent on proper operation of the SSPTS.\n\nAt 21:45 (UTC), Rick Mastracchio and Dave Williams started the first EVA of the mission, installing the S5 truss to the station, increasing the total mass of the ISS to . The EVA duration was 6 hours and 17 minutes, and all objectives were successfully completed.\n\nDuring the Mission Status press conference, Lead ISS Flight Director Joel Montalbano reported that the SSPTS was working well, and the recommendation to the Mission Management Team will be to extend the mission to the planned 14-day mission.\n\nMission Management Team chair John Shannon reported after additional analysis, it appeared that a piece of foam came off the external tank in the area of the tank's feed line, and bounced off a nearby strut, resulting in a hit to the orbiter's underside. An almost identical section of foam was lost on STS-115, but did not strike the orbiter. John reported after further review of photos taken on flight day three, they do not feel the damage went all the way through the tile, but focused inspection is still planned for flight day five, and decisions would not be made until more information is obtained. Five specific areas will be inspected during focused inspection, and with the data gathered, thermal testing can be done to determine what actions, if any, need to be taken.\n\nOverall, John Shannon classified the foam loss as a \"concern\", but only with regards to the history that the specific area has with regards to foam loss in past missions. Shannon reported that analysis would be complete by flight day 7 at the latest.\n\nJohn Shannon also reported that the possible protruding gap filler noticed on flight day 3, was reviewed further, and was determined to be \"shim stock\", which will burn off in the upper atmosphere, and poses no issues for re-entry.\n\nThe crew carried out the focused inspection without any problems, and at 20:56 (UTC), the crews of \"Endeavour\" and Expedition 15 were notified that the SSPTS was working as expected, and the mission was officially extended to the planned 14 day mission. Commander Scott Kelly replied, \"That's great news, thanks\".\n\nIn the daily mission status briefing, Lead Flight Director Matt Abbott announced the official extension of the mission, that the SSPTS was working as planned, and they were pleased with the data gathered during the focused inspection on Sunday. Mission Management Team Chairman John Shannon confirmed the decision of the Mission Management Team to extend the mission to 14 days, and to add a fourth EVA, was unanimous. He noted that the addition of SSPTS will be a valuable new tool, providing not only extended missions, but also the ability to provide the space station with additional supplies of oxygen, water, and other resources.\n\nShannon reported on the focused inspection, confirming that good laser data and imagery was obtained, and they resolved several areas of interest, classifying them as of no concern. One area of interest was two adjacent thermal plates on the shuttle's underside that had a gouge that appeared to be deeper than would allow them to rule it out. NASA would use data from the focused inspection to model the area, and do thermal analysis of the area. They will use the data to mimic the damage with sample tiles at Johnson Space Center, and using a variety of testing methods, possible courses of action would then be evaluated. No decision would be made until all data had been received and reviewed.\n\nShannon did report that following STS-118, NASA will do a thorough review of the history of foam loss from the area of the external tank since STS-114, analysis and testing would be done, and any speculation as to a future course of action would not be made until all the information was available.\n\nRick Mastracchio and Dave Williams completed the mission's second spacewalk, successfully achieving all of the scheduled activities. During the EVA, they removed a new CMG from \"Endeavour\"'s payload bay, and moved it to the Z1 truss, where they removed the failed CMG. After installing the new CMG, they placed the failed CMG on an external stowage platform, where it will remain until it is returned to Earth with mission STS-122. After initial testing on the ground, NASA reported the new CMG was functioning normally.\n\nDuring the EVA, Mastracchio reported an EVA suit alarm, indicating high levels of , but after reviewing all indicators and sensors, NASA confirmed it was an instrumentation issue, and the suit itself was fine. At the mission status briefing, NASA reported the suit would be used on future spacewalks, and the issue was not of any concern.\n\nDuring the Mission Management briefing, John Shannon discussed \"Endeavour\"s heat shield and re-entry issues. He reported that after initial modeling they believe the majority of heating will be on the backside of the gouge, and not into the filler bar side, which was the preferable situation. He reiterated that it was a complicated aerodynamic shape, and they wanted to be sure the flow would concentrate in the back \"well\" of the hole. The engineers and analysts would continue to do additional flow modeling, after which they would take the data into the arc jet testing facility for additional analysis. The first preliminary arc jet tests would be performed Monday night.\n\nShannon reported a \"team four\" had been assembled, along with the operations and engineering teams, to assist in data analysis. The teams will look at options for repair if required, and make recommendations to the Mission Management Team after the analysis of tests and data. Shannon stated he had no doubt that if a repair was required, the crew could execute it without significant impact to the mission timeline. He reiterated that this was \"not\" a catastrophic damage situation, but simply a situation that they would prefer to fix if possible, similar to the OMS blanket issue during STS-117 in June 2007.\n\nThere are three different on-orbit repair techniques available to the crew. Both post-\"Columbia\" Return to Flight missions experimented with various repair materials and techniques, and the STS-118 crew has trained for those procedures.\n\nThe \"Endeavour\" crew awoke on Tuesday to the voices of Tracy Caldwell's family singing happy birthday to her. The two crews successfully removed the ESP-3 from \"Endeavour\"'s payload bay, and installed it onto the P3 truss. They also continued with transfer activities, and several crew members took time out to have two Public Affairs events, one of them answering children's questions from the Discovery Center in Boise, Idaho. During an interview with CBS, Commander Kelly stated that he was not concerned about the tile damage, and would be comfortable with any decision NASA made, \"My understanding is this tile damage is not an issue of the safety of the crew... I'm not concerned with our safety.\" The main reason for fixing it, he noted, would be to assist with processing once the orbiter was back at the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, Kirk Shireman, Deputy International Space Station Program Manager, reported that the External Stowage Platform installation went well; the new CMG was working well, and handover of attitude control directly from the shuttle to the station was completed without problems. In addition, a new Russian computer was installed on the station, and testing of the system would be performed in late August. He also mentioned several of the experiments that were launched with STS-118, and reported all experiments were proceeding well. Shireman also noted that as of 15:17 UTC, the Zarya module of the station had orbited the Earth 50,000 times.\n\nJohn Shannon reported that the orbiter systems were in excellent shape, and had no issues. With regards to the remaining area of tile damage on the underside of the orbiter, Shannon reported that initial thermal analysis had been completed. Computational fluid dynamics testing at Ames Research Center had been done, and the preliminary results were \"cautiously optimistic\". Testing at the arc jet facility would continue Tuesday night. Shannon stated they would go through complete EVA scenario testing at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, to help develop the EVA procedures if needed.\n\nRick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson began the third EVA of the mission at 14:37 UTC. During the EVA, they successfully relocated a CETA Cart, retrieved the P6 Transponder, relocated the S-band antenna from P6 to P1, and installed a new S-Band Baseband Signal Processor and Transponder on the P1 truss. During a routine glove inspection, Mastracchio noticed a possible tear on the thumb of his left glove. To be safe, NASA managers decided to end the spacewalk at 20:05, and examination and photography of the glove was performed during suit removal. The spacewalk accomplished all but one of the tasks (MISSE retrieval). On the station, the crewmembers continued with transfer activities.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, Joel Montalbano reported that the issue with Mastracchio's suit was never a danger to the suit integrity, and the decision to cut the EVA short was one of precaution. Extended photography was performed, and additional analysis will be completed prior to the fourth EVA. Montalbano reported that the fourth EVA would be no earlier than 18 August 2007.\n\nLead spacewalk officer Paul Boehm agreed that the EVA went well, the major objectives were completed, and he reiterated that at no time was Mastracchio's suit in any danger of leaking.\n\nEVA Office Manager Steve Doering reported on the details regarding the issue with Mastracchio's glove. The EVA inspection procedure was implemented following STS-116, when a cut was found on Robert Curbeam's glove following an EVA. The EVA suit comprises five layers of material, and the second layer, called vectran, is a high strength material resistant to tearing. Mastracchio's tear was into the vectran layer. Prior to the next EVA, video analysis will be done of the path Mastracchio took during the spacewalk in an attempt to discover where the tear may have occurred. An analysis of Mastracchio's glove during the previous two EVAs will also be performed.\n\nJohn Shannon reported that no decision had been made regarding the tile damage on the underside of the orbiter, but the fourth EVA was postponed to at least 18 August 2007. The management team would continue to analyze the potential risks of repair to the underside of the orbiter, as well as any other areas of risk. Shannon reported the results of the arc jet testing showed some erosion into the backside of the adjacent tile upon re-entry, but the erosion did not go through the entire layer of the tile. Preliminary results were encouraging, but additional testing would be performed on Wednesday night. Shannon reported that the final decision would most likely be made on Thursday. Shannon said \"I am cautiously optimistic that repairs will not be needed\".\nThe station and shuttle crews continued transfer activities on flight day 9, as well as EVA preparations, which included TPS repair procedure review, in case NASA decided a repair was necessary.\n\nMission Specialists Barbara Morgan and Alvin Drew participated in an education event in the morning with students at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia. The event was hosted by Dr. June Scobee Rogers, wife of \"Challenger\"'s commander, Dick Scobee, and Founding Chairman of the Challenger Center. Morgan and Drew also spoke to reporters from the Associated Press, Reuters and Idaho Public Television.\n\nDuring the interview with Reuters, Drew stated \"We've been talking to the engineers who have been analyzing this far more than we have in space, and they seem to feel that the biggest danger is more to just being able to re-use \"Endeavour\" once it gets back on the ground. They seem to be confident, and I trust their confidence that we can get home safely even with the divot that we have in the belly,\" Morgan added \"We have a lot of faith in the program, and we'll do what the engineers decide is the best thing for us to do. We have all confidence we're going to be able to do the right thing.\"\n\nAt 01:00 UTC, 17 August 2007, CAPCOM Shane Kimbrough notified commander Kelly that the Mission Management Team decided that no repair to the damaged tile on the underside of the orbiter would be required.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, John Shannon announced the team's unanimous decision that an EVA to repair the damaged tile was not required, and the tile damage on the underside of the orbiter was not a threat to crew safety. However, the spacewalk to repair the damage could pose a variety of risks, and those risks weighed heavily into the final decision. He noted the arc jet tests actually showed a higher degree of damage than the orbiter would sustain during re-entry, so the tests were helpful in showing the worst \"possible\" damage, and still did not damage the tile during testing enough to warrant repair.\n\nShannon did note that the JSC Engineering Independent Group advised NASA managers that repairing the damage on-orbit could assist with mission turn-around time once the orbiter was on the ground. Shannon noted that the risks associated with in-flight repair outweighed the possible delay in processing the orbiter following the mission. He stated that normal turn-around time would not be compromised, as most orbiters have at least 60 tiles replaced after each mission, so the situation would not be any different than past missions.\n\nWhen pressed during the briefing by a reporter as to the chance of shuttle or crew loss, Shannon reported \"I am 100 percent comfortable that the work that has been done, has accurately characterized the damage, and that we will have a very successful re-entry\". He stated that over 200 people were involved in the decision, representing over 30 organizations, including NASA Ames Research Center, NASA's Langley Research Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, KSC, JSC, and that all the groups combined came to the same decision.\n\nShannon reported that the glove issue encountered during EVA three had been discussed, and stated that analysis would be continued, in advance of EVA four on Saturday. The crew does have a spare set of gloves, if needed.\n\nShannon reported on a micro-meteoroid debris strike discovered on the commander's window of the orbiter, which was 1 millimeter in depth. Shannon noted that it was consistent with previous damage sustained on past missions. Analysis would be conducted regarding this issue, using photographs sent down by the crew early Thursday morning.\n\nThe final item discussed was Hurricane Dean, which was heading towards the Caribbean Sea, and projected to move into the Gulf of Mexico. Contingency procedures and plans were in place, but Shannon did not anticipate it would affect the mission's timeline at all.\n\nThe station and shuttle crews had a relatively quiet day on flight day 10, continuing transfer operations, and doing some troubleshooting on a communication system between the shuttle and station. The two crews took some time out to have a joint news conference with US and Canadian news agencies, and took the official combined crew portrait. When asked by reporters on the ground whether the crew agreed with NASA's decision to return without repairing the damage to \"Endeavour\"'s underside, Commander Kelly replied, \"We agree absolutely 100 percent with the decision to not repair the damage.\"\n\nDuring the mission status briefing, Lead Flight Director Matt Abbott discussed the ongoing preparations and plans with regards to Hurricane Dean, and reported NASA was watching the storm's track closely. If required, contingency plans are available. While the mission's timeline could be changed if required, no decision was made, and the mission was proceeding as planned.\n\nDeputy ISS Program Manager Kirk Shireman reported the S-Band system relocated during the third EVA was working well, and the SSPTS provided enough oxygen to be able to completely fill all reserves on the station. Shireman commented that transfer operations were approximately 75% complete.\n\nEVA Office Manager Steve Doering reported on the decision to proceed with Saturday's EVA. The team analyzed the video downlinked from the third EVA, and the review showed no evidence of any specific event that would indicate a sharp edge, or excessive wear. A review of the manufacturing of the gloves was done, and no concerns were identified. The paths taken by astronauts during spacewalks were reviewed, identifying common paths between the third EVA, and Saturday's planned EVA, and the crew was notified of the common locations, to identify areas where additional glove inspections would be performed on Saturday. Overall, the final EVA would be less \"hand-intensive\" than the previous spacewalks, and the conclusion following the analysis was that Saturday's EVA would go ahead as planned.\n\nNASA Managers decided overnight to shorten the fourth EVA by two hours as a precaution due to Hurricane Dean's continued path into the Gulf of Mexico. The EVA duration was five hours and 2 minutes, with a total EVA time of 23 hours and 15 minutes for the mission. The EVA accomplished three primary objectives, and one get-ahead task. Two tasks were deferred: plans to tie down debris shields on the Destiny lab, and relocation of a tool box. During the spacewalk, Williams and Anderson got a good look at Hurricane Dean, and were both awed at the sight. \"Holy smoke\" was Anderon's initial comment. \"Man, that's impressive\", Williams replied. Anderson added \"They're only impressive when they're not coming towards you.\" Transfer activities were completed ahead of schedule, and both crews worked hard to get everything transferred back to \"Endeavour\" after the spacewalk.\n\nDave Williams set two records during his third EVA; He is the Canadian with the most spacewalks (3); and he passed Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield in total EVA time. Williams ended Saturday's EVA with a total of 17 hours, 47 minutes of extravehicular time.\nDuring the mission status briefing, Launch Integration Manager LeRoy Cain reported that the Mission Management Team decided to take extra precautions in preparation for the storm, and STS-118 would be cut short a day. In the event of a hurricane evacuation in Houston, an emergency command center would need to be set up. While it was a contingency set in place for years, NASA would prefer to avoid that situation. To that end, Cain reported the EVA was shortened, and the hatch closure would be done Saturday evening, rather than Sunday as planned. Undocking would be at 11:57 UTC Sunday, with the first KSC Landing opportunity on 21 August 2007.\n\nAt 19:46, a short farewell ceremony was performed, followed by hatch closure at 20:10 UTC. Tuesday's tentative KSC landing time would be 12:32 pm EST. (16:30 UTC)\n\n\"Endeavour\" successfully undocked from the International Space Station at 11:56 UTC. Saturday, NASA managers decided the station fly-around that is normally performed following each mission would not be conducted in order to give the Shuttle crew more free time during flight day 12. After several long work days, the Mission Control team felt the crew needed some downtime before the landing process began.\n\nAfter undocking, two 4-second firings of the Reaction Control System were performed, in order to distance \"Endeavour\" from the station and move to a position above it. There, the crew deployed the robotic arm, beginning Late Inspection of the reinforced carbon-carbon tiles on the nose cap and wing leading edges.\n\nAt the mission status briefing, Matt Abbott reported the undocking was \"flawless\", and the late inspection was completed successfully. Monday would be a standard pre-landing day, with checkout of the various systems on \"Endeavour\", as well as an educational media event. Entry Flight Director Steve Stich and the entry team will take over mission duties tonight, in preparation for Tuesday's landing.\n\nJohn Shannon reported the mission management team meeting went well. The landing plan was reviewed, and all teams reported \"go\" for landing on Tuesday. The latest track for Hurricane Dean was favorable for the Houston area; the storm seemed to be swinging farther south than originally expected. NASA managers were optimistic that contingency plans would not be needed. Final decisions regarding alternate plans would not be made until Monday, but Shannon noted that White Sands Space Harbor landing facility would be removed as an alternate site. Edwards Air Force Base, and Kennedy Shuttle Landing Facility would be the two sites evaluated on Monday.\n\nOn Monday, with the shuttle approximately behind the International Space Station, the crew of \"Endeavour\" performed a variety of check-out tests in preparation for entry, configured the Spacehab module for entry, and did some last minute stowage. Kelly and Hobaugh worked with the shuttle landing simulator on board, practicing the anticipated landing tracks. Kelly, Williams and Morgan took some time out to talk to students at the Canadian school, La Ronge, in Saskatchewan.\n\nDuring the mission status briefing, Entry Flight Director Steve Stich reported the track of Hurricane Dean would not require the activation of contingency plans, and the forecast looked favorable for a Tuesday landing at Kennedy Shuttle Landing Facility. There were also two opportunities for a Florida landing, with the first opportunity beginning with a deorbit burn at 15:25 UTC, and landing at 16:32 UTC. The second opportunity would call for a deorbit burn at 17:00 UTC, with landing at 18:16 UTC. Weather was not expected to interfere with landing, with a forecast of high clouds, but no inclement weather. If the second landing opportunity was taken, the shuttle would fly directly over Hurricane Dean, although it would be well above any effects of the storm. NASA did plan to call up Edwards Air Force Base as the backup site, which had two opportunities on Tuesday, but the plan was to attempt a KSC landing, and if both opportunities were waved off, NASA would decide whether to wait a day, and try for a Wednesday landing at KSC. If Wednesday opportunities at Florida were waved off due to weather, a landing at Edwards Air Force Base would be attempted.\n\nThe crew of \"Endeavour\" went right to work after waking up on Tuesday, completing the close-out of the Spacehab module, and getting into the deorbit preparations timeline. They closed payload bay doors, transitioned the vehicle computers to landing software mode and donned their reentry suits. At 14:30 UTC, the crew was given the \"go\" to begin fluid loading. This was done to assist with the crew's ability to adjust to gravity, and to prevent hypotension after landing. At 12:30 UTC, the Space Flight Meteorology Group reported to Entry Team Flight Director Steve Stich that the weather forecast was a \"go\". The weather at Kennedy Space Center showed only scattered showers moving away from the landing facility, and cross winds were not expected to be a problem. At 15:08 UTC, the crew was given a \"go\" for the deorbit burn, and the auxiliary power units were started at 15:20 UTC. The 4 minute engine burn was successfully completed at 15:28 UTC, slowing \"Endeavour\" by approximately 252 miles per hour, (/h) and adjusting the orbiter's trajectory correctly for landing.\n\nRadar acquisition of \"Endeavour\" through MILA happened at 16:19 UTC. At 16:20 UTC, the shuttle had passed the area of peak heating, with no issues reported on board. Main landing gear touchdown occurred at 16:32:16 UTC with nose gear touchdown at 16:32:29 UTC. The orbiter came to a complete stop at 16:33:20 UTC. Upon wheel stop, CAPCOM Christopher Ferguson told the crew, \"Congratulations, you've given a new meaning to the term 'higher education.'\"\nInitial post-landing inspection of the orbiter showed very little additional damage to the thermal tiles affected by the foam strike during launch. Barbara Morgan did not exit the crew transport vehicle with the rest of the crew; she remained on board the vehicle to receive additional medical tests, and would return to the Astronaut Crew Quarters in that vehicle. The remaining six crew members briefly examined the orbiter, doing the traditional post-flight \"walkaround\", posed for photos, and then returned to the crew quarters in the Astrovan.\n\nDuring the post-landing briefing, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin reported that the International Space Station was approximately 60% completed following STS-118. Griffin also stressed the importance of space exploration, and added that the damaged tile on the underside of the orbiter did very well during re-entry.\n\nAssociate Administrator for Spaceflight Operations William H. Gerstenmaier reported the damage was actually less than what the arc jet testing produced, a situation that NASA anticipated, and managers had earlier stressed that arc jets show \"worst possible\" damage. Launch and Entry Flight Director Mike Leinbach stressed how pleased he was with the mission, and with the condition of the vehicle following re-entry. He stated it was \"one of the cleanest vehicles the managers have seen since the Return to Flight policies were implemented, if not the cleanest.\"\n\nAt the end of the briefing, Griffin commented to the media who focused on Barbara Morgan being the first \"teacher in space\", that Morgan was not technically a \"teacher in space\", nor was she an \"Educator Astronaut\". He stated she was accepted as a Mission Specialist, before the new class of Mission Specialist Educators were selected in 2004, and NASA considers her to be a mission specialist, who was once a teacher. However, NASA does refer to Morgan as a Mission Specialist Educator in a number of interviews, so the terms seem to be interchangeable to most, if not to Griffin.\n\nDuring the post-landing crew press conference, Kelly was asked \"Did the tile damage enter your mind at all during re-entry, and what did you think about it once you got a look during the walkaround?\" Kelly's reply was, \"I thought about it, but only because I knew I'd be asked about it. I didn't worry about it at all. I was underwhelmed by it.\"\n\nNASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by their family, and usually has special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.\n\nSTS-322 was the designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support mission which would have been launched in the event \"Endeavour\" had become disabled during STS-118. It would have been a modified version of the STS-120 mission, which would have involved the launch date being brought forward. If it had been needed, it would have been launched no earlier than 22 September 2007. The crew for this mission would have been a four-person subset of the full STS-120 crew.\n\n\n"}

A student of the Swiss metaphysician Frithjof Schuon and an authority on the work of William Shakespeare, he is best known as the author of \"\", first published in 1983 and still in print.\n\nLings was born in Burnage, Manchester, in 1909 to a Protestant family. The young Lings gained an introduction to travelling at a young age, spending significant time in the United States because of his father's employment. Lings attended Clifton College and went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a BA in English Language and Literature. At Magdalen, he was a student and then a close friend of C. S. Lewis. After graduating from Oxford Lings went to Vytautas Magnus University, in Lithuania, where he taught Anglo-Saxon and Middle English.\n\nFor Lings himself, however, the most important event whilst at Oxford was his discovery of the writings of the René Guénon, a French metaphysician and Muslim convert, and those of Frithjof Schuon, a German spiritual authority, metaphysician and Perennialist. In 1938, Lings went to Basle to make Schuon's acquaintance. This prompted his embracing Islam to embrace the branch of the Alawiyya tariqa led by Schuon. Thereafter, Lings remained Schuon's disciple and expositor for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1939, Lings went to Cairo, Egypt, to visit a friend who was an assistant of René Guénon. Soon after arriving in Cairo, his friend died and Lings began studying Arabic. Cairo became his home for over a decade; he became an English language teacher at the University of Cairo and produced Shakespeare plays annually. Lings married Lesley Smalley in 1944 and lived with her in a village near the pyramids. Despite having settled comfortably in Egypt, Lings was forced to leave in 1952 after anti-British disturbances.\n\nOn returning to the United Kingdom he continued his education, earning a BA in Arabic and a PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London). His doctoral thesis became a book on Algerian Sufi Ahmad al-Alawi. After completing his doctorate in 1959, Lings worked at the British Museum and later the British Library, overseeing eastern manuscripts and other textual works, rising to the position of Keeper of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts 1970–73. He was also a frequent contributor to the journal \"Studies in Comparative Religion\".\n\nA writer throughout this period, Lings' output increased in the last quarter of his life. While his thesis work on Ahmad al-Alawi had been well regarded, his most famous work was a , written in 1983, which earned him acclaim in the Muslim world and prizes from the governments of Pakistan and Egypt. His work was hailed as the \"best biography of the prophet in English\" at the National Seerat Conference in Islamabad. He also continued travelling extensively, although he made his home in Kent. He died on 12 May 2005.\n\nLings and a salafist scholar named Abu Bilal Mustafa al-Kanadi had a public debate about some accounts of Lings' \"Biography of Muhammad.\" The exchange was published \"by\" Saudi Gazette.\n\nIn addition to his writings on Sufism, Lings was a Shakespeare scholar. His contribution to Shakespeare scholarship was to point out the deeper esoteric meanings found in Shakespeare's plays, and the spirituality of Shakespeare himself. More recent editions of Lings's books on Shakespeare include a foreword by Charles, Prince of Wales. Just before his death he gave an interview on this topic, which was posthumously made into the film \"Shakespeare's Spirituality: A Perspective. An Interview With Dr. Martin Lings\".\n\n\n\n"}

Chodorow (born March 2, 1950) is an American restaurateur, lawyer and financier.\n\nJeffrey Chodorow was born in the Bronx, but his father died the year he was born, so he and his mother moved to Miami, Florida in 1950 to live with Chodorow's mother's sister. His mother and aunt were both manicurists in a Cuban barbershop. He grew up in Miami Beach. Chodorow grew up very poor in a very wealthy Miami area.\n\nChodorow graduated magna cum laude from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 with a degree in economics. \nHe graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1975 as a juris doctor. He was a lawyer in Pennsylvania and Florida.\n\nIn the 1970s, Chodorow developed shopping centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1987, he opened a Bojangles' restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nIn June, 1988, BIA-COR Holdings, headed by Chodorow, purchased Braniff Inc., the 1984 successor to Braniff International Airways and Braniff International Corporation, that was owned by Hyatt Corporation. Braniff Inc., filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in September, 1989, and ceased scheduled operations in November. The carrier operated a limited Boeing 727 charter operation during December and ceased all operations at the end of the month. Chodorow's group purchased the assets of Braniff Inc., at auction and used the assets to form another Braniff named airline.\n\nIn 1991, Chodorow resurrected the defunct Braniff Inc. and named it Braniff International Airlines, Inc. after the original Braniff International Airways. However, the reborn airline was scrutinized intensely by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which did not believe that Braniff's management team, headed by Scot Spencer, was capable of conducting airline operations, based on Spencer's conduct while employed with Braniff Inc. and his criminal history. Spencer had previously been a consultant for the parent company of Braniff Inc. but had resigned, reportedly over concerns about his repeated arrests for writing bad checks and an arrest warrant for having failed to return a rental car in 1988. Seeking another way to begin flights, Braniff initiated the acquisition of the assets of bankrupt Austin, Texas air charter company Emerald Air, including its air operator's certificate, but the USDOT still refused to certify Braniff unless the principals submitted sworn affidavits stating that Spencer would not be involved in any capacity. Chodorow and others did so, which satisfied the USDOT, and the airline was granted permission to operate.\n\nBraniff International began flights on July 1, 1991, but filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a mere 37 days later. CEO Gregory Dix resigned in early September and was replaced by Chodorow. The bankrupt airline was able to secure sufficient financing to continue flying, only to shut down permanently on July 2, 1992.\n\nBy this time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and USDOT were investigating Chodorow and Spencer over an alleged money laundering scheme designed to conceal Spencer's continued management of the airline. Investigators determined that Spencer had been \"heavily involved\" in airline operations and had been paid $351,411 in secret kickbacks from commissions paid to an advertising agency. On July 19, 1994, Chodorow and Spencer were indicted for bankruptcy fraud, fraudulently concealing the bankrupt airline's property from creditors, defrauding the USDOT during the airline's certification, and obstructing a pending proceeding of the agency. In a plea bargain, the U.S. government dropped the bankruptcy fraud charges against Chodorow, in return for his guilty plea to the USDOT charges. On May 23, 1996, Chodorow was sentenced to four months in prison and four years' supervised release and was ordered to pay a $40,000 fine; he had earlier agreed to pay the airline's bankruptcy trustees $1.25 million in restitution over five years. During Chodorow's prison term, Jack Polsenberg and Neil Faggen kept the restaurants open and ran them until Chodorow was released from jail.\n\nChodorow was involved with the program \"The Restaurant\", a reality TV show that aired on NBC in 2003, with a second season broadcasting in 2004. The show was produced by Mark Burnett and starred celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito. The show portrayed the opening and running of a Manhattan restaurant as well as ongoing conflicts between DiSpirito and Chodorow, usually revolving around the lack of the restaurant's profitability. The show was canceled and DiSpirito was successfully sued by Chodorow, the restaurant's financier, to have the restaurant shut down and DiSpirito banned from entering the premises.\n\nChodorow opened the Asia de Cuba restaurant at the Schrager Morgans Hotel, He also owns China Grill Management, a collection of restaurants, a number of which are also in Schrager hotels.\n\nIn a full page ad taken out in the February 21, 2007 dining section of the \"New York Times\", Chodorow declared figurative war on critic Frank Bruni for giving him a poor review. The ad said the review was a personal attack and that he would follow up Bruni's reviews with visits to the restaurant himself, with his own review to follow on his blog.\n\nOn February 15, 2011, Sam Sifton of \"The New York Times\" reviewed Chodorow's newest restaurant Bar Basque, giving high marks to the food and trashing the decor and ambiance.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973617", "title": "Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz", "text": "Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz\n\nHyacinth Graf Strachwitz von Groß-Zauche und Camminetz (30 July 1893 – 25 April 1968) was a German Army officer. Strachwitz saw action in World War I, but rose to fame for his command of armoured forces in World War II. For these services he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds.\n\nStrachwitz was born in 1893 on his family estate in Silesia. He was educated at various Prussian military academies and served with distinction as a cavalry officer in the opening weeks of World War I. He was captured by the French in October 1914. He was nearly shot as a spy after he was caught wearing civilian clothes, but was later sentenced to forced labour. He attempted to escape several times, but was unsuccessful, and returned to Germany after the war ended in late 1918. In the aftermath of World War I, Strachwitz fought with the Freikorps in the Spartacist uprising of the German Revolution in Berlin, and in the Silesian Uprisings against the Poles and Polish Silesians of Upper Silesia. In the mid-1920s he took over the family estate, Groß Stein, from his father and became a member of the Nazi Party and the \"Allgemeine SS\". He remained an officer in the reserves, and participated in various military exercises during the 1930s.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Strachwitz was appointed as an ordnance officer. He participated in the Invasion of Poland and later in the Battle of France. Transferred to the 16th Panzer Division he fought in the Invasion of Yugoslavia and Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He fought with distinction on the Eastern Front and received awards such as the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, for his actions during the tank battle of Kalach. He was given command of \"Panzer-Regiment\" \"Großdeutschland\" and received the Swords to his Knight's Cross, for his contribution to the counterattack at Kharkov. He then fought in the Battle of Kursk and the German retreat to the Dnieper. While commanding a battle group on the Narva front in early 1944 he was awarded the Diamonds to his Knight's Cross on 15 April. He was wounded 12 times during the war, and was also injured in an automobile accident.\n\nIn 1945, he surrendered to US forces and was taken into custody. By the time of his release in June 1947, his youngest son had been killed in action, his wife had been killed in a road accident, and his Silesian estate had been confiscated by Poland. He remained in West Germany, married again and briefly worked for the Syrian Armed Forces as a military consultant. He lived on an estate in Bavaria from 1951 until his death from lung cancer on 25 April 1968. He was buried with military honours in Grabenstätt, Bavaria.\n\nStrachwitz was born on 30 July 1893 in Groß Stein, in the district of Groß Strehlitz in Silesia, a province in the Kingdom of Prussia. Today it is Kamień Śląski, in Gogolin, Opole Voivodeship, Poland. Strachwitz was the second child of Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz (1864–1942) and his wife Aloysia (1872–1940), née Gräfin von Matuschka Freiin von Toppolczan und Spaetgen. He had an older sister, Aloysia (1892–1972), followed by his younger brother Johannes (1896–1917) nicknamed \"Ceslaus\", his sister Elisabeth (1897–1992), his brother Manfred (1899–1972), his brother Mariano (1902–1922), and his youngest sister Margarethe (1905–1989). His family were members of the old Silesian nobility (\"Uradel\"), and held large estates in Upper Silesia, including the family \"Schloss\" (Palace) at Groß Stein. As the first-born son he was the heir to the title Graf (Count) Strachwitz, and following family tradition he was christened Hyacinth, after the 12th century saint. Some clothing belonging to the saint were in the family's possession until 1945.\n\nStrachwitz attended the \"Volksschule\" (primary school) and the \"Gymnasium\" (advanced secondary school) in Oppeln—present-day Opole. He received further schooling and paramilitary training at the \"Königlich Preußischen Kadettenkorps\" (Royal Prussian cadet corps) in Wahlstatt—present-day Legnickie Pole—before he transferred to the \"Hauptkadettenanstalt\" (Main Military Academy) in Berlin-Lichterfelde. Among his closest friends at the cadet academy were Manfred von Richthofen, the World War I flying ace and a fellow Silesian, and Hans von Aulock, brother of the World War II colonel Andreas von Aulock. In August 1912, Cadet Strachwitz was admitted to the élite \"Gardes du Corps\" (Life Guards) cavalry regiment in Potsdam as a \"Fähnrich\" (Ensign). The Life Guards had been established by Prussian King Frederick the Great in 1740, and were considered the most prestigious posting in the Prussian Army. Their patron was Emperor Wilhelm II, who nominally commanded them. Strachwitz was sent to an officer training course at the \"Kriegsschule\" (War School) in Hanover in late 1912, where he excelled at various sports. Strachwitz was commissioned as \"Leutnant\" (Second Lieutenant) on 17 February 1914. At this early stage of his career in Potsdam, Strachwitz began insisting on being addressed as \"\"Herr Graf\"\" rather than \"\"Herr Leutnant\"\", even from higher-ranking officers, which he maintained throughout his career. According to Röll, he always felt prouder of his aristocratic descent than of his military rank. His close friends called him \"Conté\" (Count).\n\nUpon his return to the Prussian Main Military Academy from Hanover, Strachwitz was appointed as the sports officer for the Life Guards. He introduced daily gymnastics and weekly endurance running. The Life Guards sports team was selected to participate in the planned 1916 Olympic Games, and this further encouraged his ambition. He participated equestrian, fencing and track and field athletics, which became his prime focus. Strachwitz continued to excel as a sportsman, and with his friend Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, according to Röll Strachwitz was among the best athletes to train for the Olympic Games.\n\nThe outbreak of World War I ended Strachwitz's Olympic ambitions. The Russian Empire ordered a partial mobilization one day later and the German Empire mobilized on 30 July 1914. Strachwitz received his mobilization order while on vacation in Silesia, and returned to his unit in Berlin immediately. His regiment was subordinated to the Guards Cavalry Division and scheduled for deployment in the west.\n\nShortly after the mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their assigned position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, as well as report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly on the verge of being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.\n\nStrachwitz and his men were questioned by a French captain and accused of being spies and saboteurs. They were taken to the prison at Châlons the next day where they were separated. Strachwitz, as an officer, was placed in solitary confinement. Early in the morning they were all lined up for the firing squad, but a French captain arrived just in time to stop the execution. Strachwitz and his men were then tried before a French military court on 14 October 1914. The court sentenced them all to five years of forced labour on the prison island of Cayenne. At the same time they were deprived of rank, thus losing the status of prisoners of war. Strachwitz was then taken to the prisons at Lyon and Montpellier, and then to the Île de Ré, from where the prison ship would depart for Cayenne. It is unclear what circumstances prevented his departure, but he was imprisoned at Riom and Avignon instead. At Avignon prison he was physically and mentally tortured by both the guards and the other prisoners. This included being chained naked to a wall, deprivation of food and severe beatings. After one year at Avignon he was given a German uniform and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Fort Barraux.\n\nAt Barraux he learned that the fighting in the west had turned into a war of attrition and that only on the Eastern Front were German troops still reporting successes. His health improved rapidly and Strachwitz started making escape plans. With other German soldiers he started digging an escape tunnel, which was detected. Strachwitz was again put in solitary confinement. As a deterrence against German U-boat attacks, German prisoners of war were sometimes carried in the cargo holds of French merchant ships. Now classified as \"determined to escape\", Strachwitz was put in the cargo hold of a ship which commuted between Marseilles or Toulon and Thessaloniki, Greece. Malnourished after four trips without food, he was returned to Barraux. During further solitary confinement he recovered again, and made further escape plans. With a fellow soldier, he climbed over the prison walls, planning to head for neutral Switzerland. However, Strachwitz injured his foot when he fell into barbed wire, and the injury caused blood poisoning. While searching for help, they were picked up by the French police and turned over to a military court. He was then sent to a war prison for officers at Carcassonne where his request for medical attention was ignored. The injury was severe and he became delirious. An inspection by the Swiss medical commission from the International Red Cross resulted in him being transferred to a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, where he awoke after days of unconsciousness.\n\nStrachwitz recovered quickly in Geneva. During his convalescence he was visited by members of various European royal houses and clergymen who stopped by to pay their respects. The doctors told Strachwitz that the French government had requested his extradition back to France once he had fully recovered, to serve his full term of five years of forced labour. Strachwitz then moved into a villa in Luzern where he was visited by his mother and sister. He had a great fear of being returned to France, and together they came up with a plan to avoid his extradition. He would \"sit out the war\" in a mental asylum in Switzerland. The plan worked, although Strachwitz's mental health genuinely deteriorated in the process. The war ended and Strachwitz was released to return to Germany. For his service during the war while imprisoned by the French he was awarded the Iron Cross () Second and First Class.\n\nAfter the Armistice in November 1918, Strachwitz was repatriated and returned to a Germany in civil turmoil. He travelled to Berlin via Konstanz, at the Swiss–German border, and Munich. On his journey he saw many former German soldiers whose military discipline had broken down. Unable to tolerate this situation and fearing a Communist revolution, he travelled on to Berlin, arriving at the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof where he was met by a friend. Strachwitz had called ahead asking his friend to bring him his Gardes du Corps uniform, which he put on immediately. Berlin was in a state of revolution. The newly established provisional government under the leadership of Chancellor Friedrich Ebert was threatened by the Spartacist uprising of the German Revolution, whose ambition was a Soviet-style proletarian dictatorship. Ebert ordered the former soldiers, organized in \"Freikorps\" (paramilitary organizations) among them Strachwitz, to attack the workers and put down the uprising.\n\nIn early 1919, following the events in Berlin, Strachwitz returned to his home estate, where he found his family palace had been taken over by French officers. Upper Silesia was occupied by British, French and Italian forces, and being governed by an Inter-Allied Committee headed by a French general, Henri Le Rond. The Versailles Treaty at the end of World War I had shifted formerly German territory into neighbouring countries, some of which had not existed at the beginning of the war. In the case of the new Second Polish Republic, the Treaty detached some of territory, which had formerly been part of the German Empire, to recreate the country of Poland, which had disappeared as a result of the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. His father urged him to prepare and educate himself in order to take over the family estate and business. He was put under the guidance of his father's \"Oberinspektor\" (Chief Inspector). At the same time, Strachwitz, fearing that Silesia was being \"handed over to the Poles\", as he viewed the actions of the Inter-Allied Committee, joined the \"Oberschlesischer Selbstschutz\" (Upper Silesian Self Defence). Strachwitz collected weapons and recruited volunteers, which was prohibited. He was caught four times and put in prison in Oppeln by the French. His father was also imprisoned for his opposition to the Inter-Allied Committee. Roll states that Strachwitz's distrust for the French, rooted in his experiences as a prisoner of war during World War I, was immense. He believed that only the Italians had played an honest and neutral role in the occupation of Upper Silesia. On 25 July 1919, he married Alexandrine Freiin Saurma-Jeltsch, nicknamed \"Alda\", and their first child, a son, was born on 4 May 1920.\n\nIn 1921, during the Silesian Uprisings, when Poland tried to separate Upper Silesia from the Weimar Republic, Strachwitz served under the Generals Bernhard von Hülsen and Karl Höfer. At the peak of the conflict when the Poles dug in on the Annaberg, a hill near the village of Annaberg—present-day Góra Świętej Anny. The German \"Freikorps\" launched the assault in what would become the Battle of Annaberg, which was fought between 21 May and 26 May 1921. Strachwitz and his two battalions outflanked the Polish positions and overran part of them in hand-to-hand combat around midnight on 21 May. Strachwitz was the first German to reach the summit. They captured six field guns, numerous machine guns, rifles and ammunition. On 4 June, the \"Freikorps\" attacked Polish positions at Kandrzin—present-day Kędzierzyn—and Slawentzitz—present-day Sławięcice. In this battle Strachwitz and his men captured a Polish artillery battery which they turned against the Poles. For these services he received the \"Schlesischer Adler\" (Silesian Eagle) medal, Second and First Class with Oak Leaves and Swords. His younger brother Manfred also fought for Silesia, and was severely wounded leading his men at Krizova. Two months later his wife gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Alexandrine Aloysia Maria Elisabeth Therese born on 30 July 1921, nicknamed \"Lisalex\". The Ministry of the Reichswehr informed him in 1921 that he had been promoted to \"Oberleutnant\" (First Lieutenant), the promotion backdated to 1916. The Strachwitz family grew further when on 22 March 1925 a third child, a son named Hubertus Arthur, nicknamed \"Harti\", was born on their manor at Schedlitz, later renamed Alt Siedel—present-day Siedlec.\n\nIn 1925, Strachwitz and his family moved from their palace in Groß Stein to their manor in Alt Siedel, because of personal differences with his father, who remained in Groß Stein. Between 1924 and 1933 Strachwitz founded two dairy cooperatives which many local farmers joined. In parallel he studied a few semesters of forestry. He used his knowledge to influence the Silesian forest owners to sell their wood to the paper mills. He continued to use his influence in Upper Silesia to modernize forestry and farming. His ambitions were aided by his presidency of the \"Forstausschuss\" (Forestry Committee) of Upper Silesia and his membership in the \"Landwirtschaftskammer\" (Chamber of Agriculture). Strachwitz completely took over his father's estate in 1929, first as the General Manager and then as owner, with full responsibility. This made Strachwitz one of the most wealthy land and forest owners in Silesia. Along with the palace in Groß Stein he owned a lime kiln and quarry in Klein Stein—present-day Kamionek—and Groß Stein, a distillery in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel.\n\nStrachwitz applied for membership in the Nazi Party (NSDAP—National Socialist German Workers' Party) with the \"Reichsleitung\" (Reich Leadership) of the NSDAP in Munich in 1931. He was accepted and in 1932 joined the \"Ortsgruppe\" (Local Group) of the NSDAP in Breslau with a membership number 1,405,562. On 17 April 1933 he became a member of the Allgemeine SS with the SS membership number 82,857. A series of quick promotions within the SS followed. He progressed to SS-\"Obersturmführer\" by the end of 1934 and SS-\"Sturmbannführer\" in 1936. In parallel to his SS-career, his military rank in the military reserve force also advanced. He attained the rank of \"Hauptmann\" (Captain) of the Reserves in 1934 and a year later became a \"Rittmeister\" (Cavalry Captain) of the Reserves.\n\nOn 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, came to power and began to rearm Germany. The \"Heer\" (Germany Army) was increased and modernized with a strong focus on the Panzer (tank) force. Personnel were recruited from the cavalry. In October 1935 \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was created and was subordinated to the 1st Panzer Division, at the time under command of General Maximilian von Weichs. The soldiers of the I. \"Abteilung\" (1st Battalion) came from Saxony and Thuringia, the II. \"Abteilung\" (2nd Battalion) was made up from soldiers from Silesia. Strachwitz, who had served as an officer of the reserves in \"Reiter-Regiment\" 7 (7th Cavalry Regiment) in Breslau, had asked to be transferred to the Panzer force and, in May 1936, participated in his first manoeuvre on the training ground at Ohrdruf, followed by an exercise of live firing on the gunnery training ground at Putlos—today in the administrative district of Oldenburg-Land—near the Baltic Sea. A year later, from July to August 1937, he participated in a second reserve training exercise on the Silesian training grounds at Neuhammer—present-day Świętoszów.\n\nFollowing a brief vacation in Silesia, Strachwitz returned to the 1st Panzer Division at the training grounds at Königsbrück, near Dresden. During the preparations for the fall manoeuvres the \"General der Kavallerie\" (General of the Cavalry) von Weichs was dismissed. On 18 September \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was relocated from Königsbrück to Fürstenberg and then to Neustrelitz. Here, under the watchful eyes of Hitler and Benito Mussolini from the Schmooksberg near Laage, the 1st and 3rd Panzer-Brigade, supported by \"Kampfgeschwader\" (Bomber Wings), practiced a large scale tank attack. The regiment returned to Eisenach on 30 September. Strachwitz returned to his estate but was called back shortly before the \"Anschluß\", the annexation of Austria by Germany, in March 1938.\n\nStrachwitz and \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 were placed on standby from 21 September to 2 October 1938 at the training grounds in Grafenwöhr during the Sudeten Crisis, the German annexation of Czechoslovakia's northern and western border regions, known collectively as the Sudetenland. On 3 October, the regiment headed for Karlsbad, via Gossengrün and Chodau, where they arrived on 5 October. The regiment was stationed at Saatz and Kaaden in the Sudetenland until 15 October before it returned to Eisenach on 16 October 1938. He was again put on standby in March 1939, when the remaining Czech territories became the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, a German satellite. Following this, \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was sent to Berlin to participate in the Wehrmacht parade held to celebrate Hitler's 50th birthday on 20 April 1939. In July and August 1939, \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 participated in the summer manoeuvres in Jüterbog and Putlos, followed by exercises at Altengrabow. In preparation for the opening stages of World War II, the 1st Panzer Division left their training grounds in Thuringia and Hesse on 21 August 1939 and were transported by train to Silesia between Rosenberg—present day Olesno—and Oppeln, where they arrived on the night of 24/25 August 1939. Strachwitz arrived at his regiment on 26 August where he, as the oldest Reserve officer, was assigned the task of organizing the regiment's battlefield resupply.\n\n\"Panzer-Regiment\" 2, under the command of \"Oberst\" (Colonel) Karl Keltsch, as part of the 1st Panzer Division, consisted of four light companies and two medium companies totalling 54 Panzer Is, 62 Panzer IIs, 6 Panzer IIIs, 28 Panzer IVs and 6 command Panzers. The regiment located further east in a forest near Klein-Lassowitz on the eve of 28 August 1939. \"Fall Weiß\" (Case White), Hitler's directive for the invasion of Poland, became effective and forces of the \"Wehrmacht\" invaded Poland without a formal declaration of war on 1 September 1939 which marked the beginning of World War II in Europe. His regiment also crossed the border that day at Grunsruh and reached the river Lisswarthe at noon. They took Klobutzko that evening without much resistance. On 2 September they proceeded on towards Biała Górna, where they suffered their first casualties of the war. They then crossed the Warthe at Gidle and Plauno heading for Radomsko. Suffering further losses, they captured Petrikau on 5 September. The regiment reached Góra Kalwaria at the Vistula via Wolbórz and Zawada on 8 September. Here the regiment was allowed to rest until 10 September. On this day, Keltsch informed him that Strachwitz had been nominated for the Clasp to the Iron Cross () 2nd Class for his organizational achievements, which he received on 5 October 1939. Keltsch also announced that the \"Panzer-Brigade\" 1 (1st Panzer Brigade) had requested his transfer. \"Generalmajor\" (Major General) Ferdinand Schaal, commander of \"Panzer-Brigade\" 1 at the time, welcomed him and made him responsible for organizing the replenishment of the entire brigade. On 3 October 1939, three days before the victory over Poland the 1st Panzer Division was ordered back to their home bases in Germany. They arrived on 12 October 1939. The equipment underwent intensive maintenance and Strachwitz went home to the manor at Alt Siedel for a lengthy vacation. The palace in Groß Stein had been made available to the Wehrmacht and was being used as a field hospital. When Strachwitz returned to his division in late 1939, the 1st Panzer Division had been relocated to the greater Dortmund area with the \"Stab\" (staff) located in Düsseldorf.\n\nAt the end of February 1940 the commanding general of the 1st Panzer Division, \"Generalleutnant\" (Lieutenant General) Rudolf Schmidt, was replaced by \"Generalmajor\" Friedrich Kirchner. At the time, Strachwitz was sick with meningitis and was hospitalised in early March. While he was on sick leave, the division was relocated to the South Eifel on 3 March. The \"Stab\" established the headquarters in the hotel \"Union\" in Cochem. The division, along with 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, were subordinated to XIX \"Armeekorps\" under the command of \"General der Panzertruppe\" (General of the Armoured Corps) Heinz Guderian. The soldiers were awaiting the order for \"Fall Gelb\" (Case Yellow), Hitler's directive for the Battle of France. The 1st Panzer Division had orders to cross the border at Wallendorf heading towards Luxemburg, taking the Belgian first line of defence at Martelange and then Neufchâteau. The first main objective was the Meuse River (Maas River) northwest of Sedan. Strachwitz was hospitalised again from 28 April to 9 May 1940, receiving treatment for an injured foot.\n\nKirchner received the order for \"Fall Gelb\" at 13:15, during lunch, on 9 May 1940. The German attack began at 5:35 on the morning of 10 May 1940. The XIX \"Armeekorps\" advanced without resistance through Luxemburg and reached the Belgian border at 10:00. The 1st and 2nd Panzer Division reached the line Menufontaine (south of Bastogne) – Fauvillers, the 10th Panzer Division the line Rulles (west of Habay) – St. Marie (west of Étalle), that evening. The advance breached the second Belgian line of defence at Bouillon and Neufchâteau on 11 May. The German forces, consisting of the 1st and 10th Panzer Division reached the area north of Sedan on the night of 12/13 May. The following day at 8:00 German Ju 87 Stukas and bombers from Luftflotte 3 (3rd Air Fleet) targeted the French and Belgian forces in what would become the Battle of Sedan. At 15:30 the German artillery began a 30-minute bombardment followed by an aerial attack. German troops began crossing the Meuse at 16:00 in rubber assault boats. The assault company of \"Kradschützen-Bataillon I\" (1st Motorcycle Infantry Battalion) under the command of Wend von Wietersheim established the first bridgehead north of Igles and west of Saint-Menges.\n\nBy 01:00 on 14 May, a pontoon bridge had been erected over which elements of the 1st Panzer Division began crossing the Meuse into the bridgeheads. General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces ordered an air strike against the pontoon bridge. Between 15:00 and 16:00 Allied bombers and fighters attacked the bridge. During this attack, Strachwitz organized the traffic across the bridge and ensured delivery of the anti-aircraft ammunition to help fend off the aerial attack, which inflicted only minor damage and did not stop the German advance. \"Panzer-Pionierbataillon\" 37 and \"Sturm-Pionierbataillon\" 43 ran into enemy tanks at Chéhéry and \"Panzer-Brigade\" I into French tanks at Bulson. More than 70 French tanks were left destroyed on the battlefield. While Kirchner ordered the bulk of 1st Panzer Division to keep heading west, French General Charles Huntziger ordered elements of his \"IIe Armée\" to protect the heights of Stonne, south of Sedan. This dissipated his forces and the French resistance was broken near Vendresse.\n\nAccording to Roll, during the advance in France Strachwitz adopted the thinking that \"Tanks must be led from the front!\" Even in his role as supply officer he led \"from the front\", often carrying out \"solo runs\". During one of these, Strachwitz and his driver stumbled into a French-occupied barracks. Unable to withdraw, he requested to speak to the French commanding officer and convinced him to surrender his unit. Leading the way, Strachwitz drove 600 French soldiers and their vehicles into captivity. The element of surprise was enough to overcome a numerically superior enemy force.\nFollowing these events the 1st Panzer Division continued to push forward, reaching the Channel coast near Calais on 23 May 1940, where they encountered heavy British resistance. The 10th Panzer Division was tasked with taking Calais, while Guderian ordered the 1st Panzer Division to head for Gravelines. Elements of the \"Panzer-Brigade\" I, the subordinated \"Infanterie-Regiment\" (motorized) \"Großdeutschland\" and the \"Panzeraufklärungsabteilung\" 4 (Tank Reconnaissance Detachment 4) reached the Aa river south of Gravelines that night, southwest of Dunkirk. Strachwitz again went on one of his solo runs, penetrated the French and British lines and almost reached Dunkirk, where he observed the evacuation of British and allied forces by sea. He quickly reported his observations to his divisional command. The Ia (operations officer) \"Major im Generalstab\" (in the General Staff) Walther Wenck informed him that aerial reconnaissance had made the same observations but the \"Führerhauptquartier\" had ordered the Panzers to halt. Three days later Hitler ordered the attack to continue but the opportunity to capture the majority of the Allied forces had been lost. The remaining defenders of Dunkirk continued to hold out until 4 June.\n\nParts of the 1st Panzer Division were relocated via Arras, Cambrai and Hirson to Rethel on 2 June. The second phase of the Battle of France, \"Fall Rot\" (Case Red), was about to begin and Strachwitz returned to his \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 where he again organized the replenishment of the troops. The 1st Panzer Division flanked on the right by the 2nd Panzer Division and the XXXXI. Armeekorps (motorized) on the left, was ordered to cross the Aisne River breaching the French defences and head south. The first main objective was the Canal du Rhine au Marne which was roughly away. The French defenders of the Weygand Line, named after Maxime Weygand, had built strong defences, running parallel to the Aisne and Aisne Canal. The German attack began on 5 June with \"Heeresgruppe B\" (Army Group B), under the command of \"Generaloberst\" (Colonel General) Fedor von Bock, attacking between the Channel coast and the Aisne. \"Heeresgruppe A\" (Army Group A), under \"Generaloberst\" Gerd von Rundstedt, to which the 1st Panzer Division was subordinated, was held back until 9 June. Strachwitz in the meantime had been awarded the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class on 6 June for his daring \"solo runs\". The two regiments of the 1st Panzer Division cross the Aisne on the night of 9/10 June 1940. The two regiments advanced quickly to Neuflize and Juniville, where they were engaged in combat with French tanks. The advance proceeded along La Neuveville to Bétheniville and Saint-Hilaire-le-Petit. The military training grounds at Mourmelon-le-Grand was captured on 12 June. The fortress Langres surrendered to \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 on 15 June and Besançon the following day. The final objective was Belfort, which capitulated after a short resistance. This ended the Battle of France for Strachwitz's regiment. \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was then stationed at Doubs until 3 July 1940, it was then relocated to Saint Denis, north of Paris, from 3–8 July.\n\nOn 21 July the regiment was relocated again, this time in the vicinity of Orléans where it was based for four weeks. The regiment was ordered to detach two Panzer companies and the headquarters unit of the I. \"Abteilung\" (1st Battalion). These units, augmented by other Panzer companies, formed four \"Schwimm-Panzerabteilungen\" (amphibious tank battalion) for Operation Sea Lion, the planned and aborted invasion of the United Kingdom. The remnants of \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 were then transferred to East Prussia, where they were based at Heiligenbeil, present-day Mamonovo.\n\nOn 2 October 1940, following the Battle of France, \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was subordinated to the 16th Panzer Division. Strachwitz asked the divisional commander \"Generalmajor\" Hans Hube for the command of a Panzer company, and Hube gave Strachwitz the I. Bataillon, a position he held until October 1942. Strachwitz and his men trained on the new Panzer III with 5 cm KwK 38 cannon. He paid special attention to the training and integration of the replacements crews which joined his unit. In December 1940, 16th Panzer Division was declared a \"Lehrtruppe\" (demonstration troop), a unit to be involved in experimentation with new weapons and tactics. Via Bavaria, Austria and Hungary they were transferred to Romania, with Strachwitz's I. Battalion stationed at Mediaș.\n\nThe division was tasked with the protection of the oil fields at Ploiești, which were vital to the German war effort. They trained some Romanian officers in German Panzer tactics. Apart from training and maintaining their equipment, the soldiers had nothing to do and became bored. In March 1941 Strachwitz was sent back to Cosel in Germany where a new replacement unit was to be founded. He returned via his home town and 24 hours later a telegram from Hube called him back. This was preceded by a series of events in Belgrade. On 25 March 1941, the government of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia had signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the war. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović. As a result, Hitler chose not only to support Mussolini's ambitions in Albania and in the Greco-Italian War but also to attack Yugoslavia. For this purpose the mobilized forces of \"Panzergruppe\" I (1st Panzer Group) under the command of \"Generaloberst\" Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist were ordered to attack Belgrade in what would become the Invasion of Yugoslavia.\nStrachwitz's I. Battalion received the order to prepare for the attack on 6 April 1941 at 09:00. His orders were to break through with the \"Infanterie-Regiment\" (motorized) \"Großdeutschland\" to Belgrade via Werschetz—present-day Vršac. His right flank was protected by the SS-Division \"Das Reich\" and his left flank by the 11th Panzer Division. The attack was preceded by a heavy artillery barrage and the Germans crossed the border at 10:30. The defences were quickly taken and the German troops reached the Werschetz where they were greeted by cheering inhabitants and a band. Their next objective was the River Danube. They reached the Danube at Pančevo only to find the bridge there destroyed. At Pančevo Strachwitz's unit linked up with the 11th Panzer Division, and he encountered his oldest son, Hyacinth, who was serving with that formation. Strachwitz started confiscating boats and barges in an attempt to cross the Danube. This work had begun when Strachwitz received the order to halt all activities. His unit was ordered to retreat to Timișoara. On 16 April, Hube announced that the 16th Panzer Division would no longer be needed in the campaign and were ordered to regroup at Plovdiv. In early May 1941 \"Oberstleutnant\" Rudolf Sieckenius was given command of \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2, succeeding \"Oberst\" Hero Breusing. The entire 16th Panzer Division was ordered back to their home bases in Germany, with \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 ordered to Ratibor—present-day Racibórz—where their equipment was overhauled. Strachwitz was awarded the Coroana României on 9 June 1941.\n\nIn mid-June 1941, the division received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially believed that they were just going to transit through Russia, on their way to the Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But \"Generalfeldmarschall\" (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a \"Leutnant\" in the 4th company of \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German offensive against the Soviet Union began early on 22 June 1941 with an artillery barrage. The 16th Panzer Division was subordinated to \"Heeresgruppe Süd\" (Army Group South) under the command of \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Von Rundstedt. The goal, together with the 6. Armee and 17. Armee as well as \"Panzergruppe\" I, was to follow the pincers of both armies, heading for Kiev and rolling up the Soviet flanks in the process, and finally encircling them at the Dnieper River. The main objective was to conquer the economically important Donets Basin as well as the oil field in the Caucasus.\n\nGerman army reconnaissance aircraft spotted the first Soviet formations in the vicinity of the 16th Panzer Division on the morning of 26 June. By this date the division had already progressed beyond the German-Soviet demarcation line and had suffered numerous losses due to mechanical failures caused by the dusty roads. \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was ordered to engage the Soviet T-26 tanks which were supported by strong infantry units. In the resulting battle Strachwitz was wounded in his left arm, but he remained with his unit. The heavy counter-attack was repulsed and the bridgehead over the Bug River, held by the division's motorcycle battalion (\"Kradschützen-Bataillon\" 16), was secured. The logistics system could not keep up and his regiment was not resupplied until 28 June. His unit first encountered the T-34 and a few KV-1 and KV-2 tanks the following day. These tanks had stronger armour and outgunned his Panzer III tanks. Only with the support of the 8.8 cm Flak artillery, deployed in an anti tank role, were they able to repulse the Soviet forces.\n\nDuring the Battle of Uman (15 July – 8 August 1941) Strachwitz received a head injury on 29 July and was hit again by shrapnel in the arm the next day. He received first aid in the field and stayed with his men. The injured arm became infected and he had to receive medical attention in a field hospital on 10 August. He released himself again on 12 August returning to the regiment which had been led by \"Oberleutnant\" von Kleist during his absence.\nStrachwitz, advancing his Panzer III ahead of his troops, engaged a Soviet supply convoy, destroying a large number of soft-skinned vehicles and several artillery batteries. Strachwitz was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his part in this action on 25 August 1941. The presentation was made by Hube in the field on 5 September.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Uman \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was given a rest. On 8 September the attack resumed and the regiment crossed the Dnjepr on the night of 11/12 September. Together with the I. battalion of \"Schützen-Regiment\" 79 they started their attacked on Lubny and ambushed and destroyed a Soviet supply convoy. The attack on Lubny ended on 14 September. The Kiev pocket was sealed when panzers of the 3. \"Panzer-Division\" linked up with \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 on 15 September 1941. The spearhead of \"Panzergruppe\" 2, under Guderian and \"Panzergruppe\" 1, under Von Kleist had captured 50 Soviet Divisions. \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 was then dispatched to prevent Soviet troops from escaping the pocket. For \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 the battle of Kiev continued until 4 October 1941.\n\nStrachwitz was promoted to \"Oberstleutnant\" (lieutenant colonel) of the Reserves on 1 January 1942. He had left the Eastern Front at the end of November 1941, returning home to receive treatment for the numerous injuries he had sustained over the year. From 1 December 1941 – 9 January 1942 he stayed at hospitals in Oppeln and Breslau. He then went on an extended leave, staying in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel, before returning to the Eastern Front in mid-March 1942. He received the 1939 version of the Wound Badge in Silver on 17 March 1942.\n\nThroughout the summer of 1942 Strachwitz led his tanks in the advance to the Don River and across it to Stalingrad. At Kalach on the Don his regiment claimed the destruction of more than 270 Soviet tanks within 48 hours. His unit was the first to reach the Volga River north of Stalingrad on 23 August 1942. According to Williamson, it was during this campaign that Strachwitz gained the nickname \"der Panzergraf\" (the Armoured Count). By late August, the 16th Panzer Division was assigned to \"General der Panzertruppe\" Friedrich Paulus' 6. Armee, and Strachwitz had been promoted to command the entire \"Panzer-Regiment\" 2. During one engagement on the northern flank of the \"Kessel\", his unit claimed to have destroyed 105 T-34s.\n\nStrachwitz and his driver, \"Feldwebel\" Haase, were severely wounded on 13 October 1942, requiring immediate treatment in a field hospital. A direct hit on their command Panzer caused severe burns. Strachwitz had to hand over command of his I./\"Panzer-Regiment\" 2 to \"Hauptmann\" Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven. He then had to be flown out and was treated at a hospital at Breslau until 10 November 1942. He received further treatment at the Charité in Berlin from 11–18 November 1942. During this stay he received news that he had been awarded the 144th Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He was ordered to the \"Führerhauptquartier\" in December 1942 for the presentation of the Oak Leaves by Hitler himself. He then went to Bad Gastein for a period of convalescence before spending his vacation at home in Alt Siedel. Strachwitz was promoted to \"Oberst\" (colonel) of the Reserves on 1 January 1943. He then learned that Hube had been ordered to the \"Führerhauptquartier\" for the presentation of the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Strachwitz took the opportunity and reported to Hube, volunteering for service in the Stalingrad pocket. Hube rejected this request, stating that Strachwitz would be better deployed somewhere else.\n\nAt the end of January 1943 Strachwitz was ordered to the \"Führerhauptquartier\". Talking to General Rudolf Schmundt and Kurt Zeitzler, the Chief of Staff of the \"Oberkommando des Heeres\", he was tasked with the creation of the Panzerregiment \"Großdeutschland\". The regiment was subordinated to the Infantrie-Division (motorized) \"Großdeutschland\" then under the command of \"Generalmajor\" Walter Hörnlein. He led the regiment when it took part in the Third Battle of Kharkov, fighting alongside SS-\"Gruppenführer\" Paul Hausser's II SS Panzer Corps. Strachwitz was awarded the Wound Badge in Gold on 16 February 1943 and on 28 March 1943 the Swords to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. He received the latter for his leadership at Kharkov and Belgorod. He received the award together with Georg-Wilhelm Postel who had been awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.\n\nOn 5 July 1943, the first day of Operation Citadel (5–16 July 1943), the German code name for the Battle of Kursk, in the \"Großdeutschland\" area of operations, the Panther battalion got bogged down in the mud near Beresowyj and failed to support the \"Füsilier\"s attack. Nipe indicates that often \"Oberst\" Karl Decker and \"Oberstleutnant\" Meinrad von Lauchert have been made responsible for this failure. However, Nipe argues \"that it can safely be assumed that Strachwitz was present; thus, any responsibility regarding actions of \"Großdeutschland\"s Panzers belongs to the Panzer Count.\" Following the battle, Decker wrote a letter to Guderian complaining about the unnecessary losses incurred by the \"Großdeutschland\" division. In this letter Decker stated that how Strachwitz led his tanks on the first day of Kursk was \"idiotic\". Strachwitz was wounded again on 10 July. His battle group had been ordered into combat by Hörnlein. The objective was to capture Hill 258.4, about west of Werchopenje. The battle group encountered roughly 30 Soviet tanks on evening of 9 July. An attack proved unfeasible due to the settling darkness. During these events he received news that his son, Hyacinth, had been severely wounded. At dusk on 10 July he ordered the attack on the Soviet tanks. The first T-34s had been destroyed and Strachwitz was directing the attack from his command Panzer and had ordered his gunner to hold fire. Strachwitz was carelessly resting his left arm on the gun-breech. The gunner, without orders, fired the gun, causing the recoiling gun to smash his left arm. Strachwitz was immediately evacuated to a field hospital. Strachwitz's arm was put in a cast and against medical advice he returned to his regiment. When Hörnlein learned of this he gave Strachwitz a direct order to return to the field hospital.\n\nIn November 1943, Strachwitz left the \"Großdeutschland\" on grounds of ill-health, ostensibly due to his injuries. Röll speculates, however, that tension between him and the division's commander, Hörnlein, may have been the true reason for Strachwitz's departure. Otto Carius stated that:\n\"Gossip mongers maintained that the Großdeutschland Panzer-Regiment was taken away from Strachwitz because he had too many losses. I had justifiable doubts concerning this claim. Graf Strachwitz and his staff were always employed at hot spots on the front, where they had to carry out extremely pressing operations, for which every form of support was provided to them. Painful losses couldn't always be avoided during those types of operations. But it was through these losses that the lives of many soldiers from other units were saved.\"\n\nThe severe injury to Strachwitz's left arm forced him to retire from the front line. After a stay in the hospital at Breslau and a period of convalescence at home he received a teleprinter message commanding him as \"\"Höheren Panzerführer\"\" (higher tank commander) to the Army Group North. Strachwitz reported to the commander-in-chief of the 18th Army, \"Generaloberst\" Georg Lindemann, who was tasked with the leadership of Army Group North.\n\nOn 26 March 1944, the Strachwitz Battle Group consisting of the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions and tanks, attacked the flanks of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps south of the Tallinn railway, supported by an air strike. The tanks led the attack and the East Prussian grenadiers followed, penetrating the fortified positions of the Soviet rifle corps. By the end of the day, the Soviet 72nd and parts of the 109th Rifle Corps in the \"Westsack\" (west sack) of the bridgehead were encircled. The rest of the Soviet rifle corps retreated, shooting the local civilians who had been used for carrying ammunition and supplies from the rear.\n\nAs Strachwitz had predicted, the rifle corps counterattacked on the following day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through the lines of the rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.\n\nThe \"Ostsack\" (east sack) of the Krivasoo bridgehead, defended by the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were confused by the Strachwitz Battle Group's diversionary attack on 6 April. The attack deceived the Soviet forces into thinking that the German attack intended to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army and started with a heavy bombardment. The positions of the 59th Army were attacked by dive bombers and the forest there was set afire. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army's defences, splitting the two rifle corps apart and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov was outraged by the news, sending in the freshly re-deployed 8th Army. Their attempt to cut off the Tiger I tanks was repelled by Lieutenant Günther Famula, who received a posthumous Knight's Cross for these actions, keeping their supply lines open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered his troops to switch on to the defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops from all causes, was withdrawn from the bridgehead. For these successes Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds on 15 April 1944. News of the award had reached his headquarters on the early morning of 15 April via teleprinter message. The official presentation was made a few weeks later by Hitler.\n\nThe advance brought the Strachwitz Battle Group hope of destroying the entire bridgehead. However, the spring thaw meant that the tanks were impossible to use. The 8th Army repelled the German attack, which lasted from 19–24 April 1944. The Germans lost 2,235 troops, dead and captured, in the offensive, while the total of German casualties in April, from all causes, was 13,274. Soviet casualties in April are unknown, but are estimated by Mart Laar to be at least 30,000 men from all causes. The losses exhausted the strengths of both sides. The front subsequently stagnated with the exception of artillery, air, and sniper activity and clashes between reconnaissance platoons for the next several months.\n\nStrachwitz led an ad-hoc formation in Operation \"Doppelkopf\" (double-head) as part of Dietrich von Saucken's XXXIX Panzer Corps counter-offensive following the major Soviet final stages of advance in Operation Bagration. Von Saucken's goal was to relieve the encircled forces in the Courland Pocket. Strachwitz's attack on 18 August 1944 was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment from the heavy cruiser \"Prinz Eugen\"; forces inside the pocket attacked to link up with Strachwitz's force. His troops reached the 16. Armee at Tukums by midday.\n\nThis previous paragraph is inconsistent with the factual events, although the fog of war surrounds the circumstances of Graf von Strachwitz's formation which was known as Panzer verbande Strachwitz the following facts are clear. The formation consisted of PZ Brigade 101, Waffen-SS Kampfgruppe Martin Gross and was led by Graf Strachwitz and his Panther and Grenadier force between 15 August and 23 August. Their mission as the far northern arm of operation Doppelkopf was to clear a land line between German Army forces located in the Kurland Peninsula and isolated by two Soviet Divisions. The salient was some thirty miles wide existing from west of Tuckum east to the western side of Riga. Soviet forces had seized Tuckum and up to the Baltic coastline after clearing German forces from Mitau and Schaulen 26 July through 31 July. Although vastly smaller than the other Panzer forces of Doppelkopf, which were division sized the Strachwitz force was limited to some 80 armored vehicles. It would be the only successful force of the offensive however through the bold and daring field leadership Strachwitz displayed. This attack is launched on 19 August and is supported by the formations own attached artillery west of Biksti, the multi-stage operation takes Tuckum 20 August where that attack has naval artillery fir support from 2nd Baltic Task Force. (Prinz Eugen, three Destroyers and attached torpedo boats. The successful link up of Graf Strachwitz's Panther tanks takes place between 11-12 pm just before 21 August in Riga. The isolated Army Group North is no longer cut off.\n\nDuring a visit to a division command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.\n\nThe Red Army started the Vistula–Oder Offensive on 12 January 1945. The attack began with an intense bombardment by the guns of the 1st Ukrainian Front against elements of Army Group A, initially under the command of \"Generaloberst\" Josef Harpe. Within a matter of days the Soviet forces involved had advanced hundreds of kilometres, taking much of Poland and striking deep within the borders of the Reich. The offensive broke Army Group A, and much of Germany's remaining capacity for military resistance. The Soviet forces crossed the Silesian border on 19 January and Harpe was relieved of his command and replaced by \"Generaloberst\" Ferdinand Schörner on 20 January. Schörner established his headquarters at Oppeln. Here Strachwitz, on crutches, went to see Schörner, requesting a front command to defend his homeland. Schörner declined the offer and Strachwitz insisted on another assignment. Bending to the request, Schörner initially kept him in his staff where Strachwitz conceived the plan of creating a specialized \"Panzerjagdbrigade\" (tank-hunting brigade). The 3rd Guards Tank Army conquered Groß Strehlitz on 23 January 1945. The following day Groß Stein fell into the hands of the advancing Red Army and Strachwitz's palace and entire estate were confiscated. Schörner yielded to the demands of Strachwitz, and authorized the creation of the \"Panzerjägerbrigade\". These brigades were not mechanized units but rather infantry soldiers deploying hand-held weapons such as the Panzerfaust. On 30 January 1945, he was promoted to \"Generalleutnant\" of the Reserves and organized his staff of the Panzerjäger-Brigade \"Oberschlesien\" at Bad Kudova—present-day Kudowa-Zdrój in Kłodzko Land.\n\nHis staff searched for volunteers in the \"Unteroffiziersschulen\" (non-commissioned officers schools) and supplementary units. They were able to bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.\n\nFollowing a visit of the commander of the \"Panzerjagdverbände\" (tank-hunting detachment) of Army Group Vistula, \"Oberst\" Ernst-Wilhelm Freiherr Gedult von Jungenfeld, all of the \"Panzerjagdverbände\" were to be centralized under Strachwitz' command. In April the \"Panzerjagdeinheiten\" (tank-hunting units) of Army Group Centre were all put under his command, this included \"Panzerjagdverbände\" A, B and C (Wehrkreis VIII), the \"Heeres-Panzerjagdbrigaden\" 1 and 3, two \"Volkssturm-Panzerjagdbrigaden\" and the Panzerjäger-Brigade \"Niederschlesien\" (Lower Silesia) and Free Ukrainians. Strachwitz deployed his men in small combat groups, sometimes operating behind Allied lines, which lured Soviet tanks into traps and attacked them with Panzerfausts. Combat reached its peak in April 1945, and some of his men were credited with more than ten enemy tanks destroyed each. The German front line of Army Group Centre at the time was in mid-Silesia along the Zobten, and via Schweidnitz and Jauer to Lauban. The main Soviet thrust was towards Berlin and Dresden, threatening the German troops in Silesia with encirclement. Strachwitz and his men fought under the command of Schörner until the German capitulation on 8 May 1945.\n\nIn the aftermath, Strachwitz led his men in a successful breakout from their encirclement in Czechoslovakia to the U.S.-held region of Bavaria, where they surrendered to U.S. Army forces near Felgen. Strachwitz was taken to the prisoner of war camp at Allendorf near Marburg, where he was interned together with Franz Halder, Guderian and Adolf Galland.\n\nIn 1969, Peter Hoffmann, a Canadian historian of German descent, published a book with the title \"Widerstand, Staatsstreich, Attentat — Der Kampf der Opposition gegen Hitler\" \"[Resistance, Coup d'etat, Assassination — The Battle of the Opposition against Hitler]\". This work lists Strachwitz as being part of the German military resistance to Nazism. With Generals Hubert Lanz, Hans Speidel, and he is shown as being associated with \"Plan Lanz\", as testified by \"General der Gebirgstruppe\" Hubert Lanz. According to Lanz, the plan was to arrest or kill Hitler in early February 1943 during Hitler's scheduled visit to \"Armeeabteilung Lanz\". In his account, Strachwitz's role was to surround Hitler and his escorts shortly after Hitler's arrival with his tanks. Lanz stated that he would have then arrested Hitler, and in the event of resistance, Strachwitz's tanks would have shot and killed the entire delegation. Hitler cancelled the visit and the plan was dropped. Author Röll casts doubt on this account citing that Strachwitz's cousin, Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1943, had recounted that Strachwitz had expressed the belief to him several times that killing Hitler would have constituted murder. Röll concludes that Strachwitz was too much a Prussian officer to consider assassinating Hitler.\n\nStrachwitz was released by the Allies in June 1947. He had lost his wife, his youngest son and his estate during the war. Alda had been killed on 6 January 1946 in a traffic accident with a US military truck in Velden an der Vils. Strachwitz, still a US prisoner of war in camp Allendorf near Marburg, was denied permission to attend the funeral. Harti, who had lost a leg, was killed in action shortly before the end of the war on 25 March 1945 near Holstein. Strachwitz married again on 30 July 1947 in Holzhausen. With his new wife Nora, née von Stumm (1916–2000), he had four children, two daughters and two sons, born between 1951 and 1960.\n\nHe and his wife accepted the invitation of Husni al-Za'im to move to Syria to work as an agricultural and military advisor to the Syrian Armed Forces. This he did from January to June 1949, a period during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (15 May 1948 – 10 March 1949), in which Syria fought. Strachwitz, bragging about his military successes in the Soviet Union, had a very difficult time with the Syrian officers, and his agricultural suggestions were ignored as well. When Adib Shishakli seized power, Strachwitz and his wife left Syria. In the meantime, they had received a visa for Argentina, where they hoped to find another advisory position. Via Lebanon, they arrived in Livorno, Italy, where they changed their plans and ran a winery. They returned to Germany in 1951 with a Red Cross passport. Strachwitz settled on an estate in Winkl near Grabenstätt in Bavaria and founded the \"\"Oberschlesisches Hilfswerk\"\" (Upper Silesian Fund) supporting fellow Silesians in need.\n\nStrachwitz lived out his final years quietly and died on 25 April 1968 of lung cancer in hospital in Trostberg. \"Der Panzergraf\" was laid to rest in the village cemetery of Grabenstätt, beside his first wife. The Bundeswehr provided an honour guard as a mark of respect. Heinz-Georg Lemm delivered the eulogy.\n\n\nStrachwitz is often credited with the German Cross in Gold awarded on 29 May 1943, this however was awarded to his son, also named Hyacinth, who received this award as \"Oberleutnant\" in the 4./Panzer-Regiment 15.\n\n\n\n"}

Together with British Columbia Highway 3 which begins in Hope, it forms an interprovincial route that serves as an alternate to the Trans-Canada from the Lower Mainland to the Canadian Prairies.\n\nHighway 3 begins as a two-lane continuation of BC Highway 3 in the Canadian Rockies at Crowsnest Pass, winding through the foothills to a junction with Highway 2 west of Fort Macleod. Briefly concurrent with Highway 2, it becomes a divided highway and part of Alberta's \"Export Highway\", a segment of the CANAMEX Corridor that stretches from Alaska to Mexico. In Lethbridge it is an expressway named Crowsnest Trail that crosses the Oldman River and meets the northern termini of Highways 4 and 5; the former is a major route that assumes the designation of the Export Highway, connecting to Interstate 15 in Montana, while the latter branches southwest to Magrath and Cardston. Leaving Lethbridge, Highway 3 passes through Coaldale and Taber before reverting to a two-lane highway that ends at Highway 1 in Medicine Hat.\n\nFor its entire length, Highway 3 follows the alignment of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was first a rough dirt road known as the Red Trail plotted in the early 1900s. Later numbered as Highway No. 3, it was designated as a southern branch of the former Trans-Canada Highway by the 1920s and improved to gravel then eventually paved, widened with shoulders, and upgraded to an expressway in sections. The Trans-Canada was officially routed through Calgary in the 1960s, but Highway 3 remained an important alternate route to the west coast and was incorporated into the National Highway System in 1988. Twinning of the first segment between Lethbridge and Coaldale had been completed by the mid-1960s, and it was officially named the Crowsnest Highway in the late 1970s. A major expressway realignment along Crowsnest Trail in central Lethbridge was completed in the 1980s, and twinning of the Fort Macleod–Lethbridge segment was completed in the mid-1990s.\n\nAlberta Transportation has long-term plans to upgrade the entire route to a freeway; the work will include twinning west of Fort Macleod and east of Taber, and an eventual elimination of at-grade intersections. Plans have been drafted for a free-flowing bypass of Lethbridge that will realign Highways 3 and 4 to the north and east of the city respectively, and a future Fort Macleod bypass will realign Highway 3 to the south of the town connecting to a newly extended Highway 2. Funding has not yet been allocated for any of the future upgrades, nor any potential timeline for the projects.\n\nHighway 3 was designated as one of the original core routes of the National Highway System in 1988, an interprovincial route connecting large population centres. Most of the road is an undivided two-lane highway with a speed limit of outside of rural areas. From Fort Macleod to West Lethbridge and from Coaldale to Taber it is a divided highway with a speed limit of . Highway 3 is a divided expressway between Fort Macleod and Lethbridge that forms a portion of Alberta's Export Highway, a segment of the CANAMEX Corridor that facilitates the movement of goods between Alaska and Mexico. The Fort Macleod–Lethbridge segment also comprises the westernmost portion of the Red Coat Trail, a historic route advertised as that which was travelled by the North-West Mounted Police in the late 19th century in their quest to bring order and peace to the region.\n\nBritish Columbia Highway 3 is a two-lane undivided highway that becomes Alberta Highway 3 at the border in mountainous terrain, paralleling a branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It first crosses over to the south side of the railway and passes through the centre of Island Lake on a causeway, part of which is natural terrain. It curves through communities of the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass on the south side of Crowsnest Lake, crossing the Crowsnest River and reaching Highway 40 at Coleman. It continues alongside the railway through Blairmore, again crossing the Crowsnest River and bisecting the community of Frank and the rubble of the Frank Slide, a major landslide that killed more than 70 people in 1903. The highway, the Crowsnest River, and the railway meander east into the Municipal District of Pincher Creek No. 9 and Burmis from which Highway 507 splits south to Beaver Mines and forms an alternate route from the west into Pincher Creek. Highway 3 curves northeast to the hamlet of Lundbreck which it bypasses, and from which Highway 22 begins and runs north. The first of four former alignments of Highway 3 (all of which are now designated as Highway 3A) passes through Lundbreck, splitting from Highway 3 prior to the hamlet and rejoining it later.\n\nEast of Lundbreck and Cowley, the highway crosses Castle River to Highways 6 and 785 north of Pincher Creek. It briefly parallels the creek for which the town was named before crossing it and reaching Brocket, and Highway 786 which meets Highway 507 southeast of Pincher Creek. Highway 3 follows the Oldman River to Fort Macleod, approximately east of Brocket. Just prior to Fort Macleod, the highway enters the Municipal District of Willow Creek No. 26 and Highway 810 splits south to the communities of Ardenville and Glenwood after which Highway 3 widens to a divided highway. It meets Highway 2 at a trumpet interchange, and diverges into a one-way road pair through Fort Macleod at a reduced speed limit of , concurrent with Highway 2. Highway 811 turns north from Highway 3 in central Fort Macleod to cross the Oldman River on a historic alignment of Highway 2. At the Fort Macleod Health Centre, Highways 2 and 3 curve southeast to leave the town as the one-way roads rejoin into a divided highway. The concurrency ends as Highway 2 splits south as a two-lane highway to Cardston and the United States border at Carway. Highway 3 bends back to the northeast, now designated as the Red Coat Trail and carrying CANAMEX traffic destined for the primary border crossing on Highway 4 at Coutts.\n\nThe divided highway continues northeast from Fort Macleod with a speed limit of , paralleling the Oldman River. It curves east to bypass Monarch to the south and crosses the river, entering Lethbridge County. Highway 3 formerly passed through Monarch until the 1990s construction of the bypass; that route is now designated as Highway 3A and meets Highway 23 east of the town which then joins Highway 3 north of the confluence of the Oldman and Belly Rivers. After curving southeast, Highway 509 splits southwest to Stand Off. Highway 3 intersects 51 Avenue, the main access for the town of Coalhurst. Westview Drive splits into West Lethbridge at a partial interchange and for less than one kilometre it forms the third route designated as Highway 3A. Highway 3 continues east, entering the city of Lethbridge as a freeway and meeting Highway 25/University Drive at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Highway 25 runs north to Picture Butte, while University Drive connects to the University of Lethbridge and is the main thoroughfare of West Lethbridge.\n\nHighway 3 is named Crowsnest Trail in Lethbridge. Immediately east of Highway 25 it descends into the Oldman River valley, entering city limits near a trumpet interchange at Bridge Drive. It then crosses the river as the speed limit reduces to . The highway interchanges with 5 Avenue N and Scenic Drive in north Lethbridge. It passes north of Park Place Mall to a diamond interchange at Stafford Drive. The freeway passes over 13 Street, to which access is provided only from the westbound direction. The freeway section ends at an interchange with Mayor Magrath Drive, the northern terminus of Highway 5. Crowsnest Trail continues east as an expressway past several at-grade intersections to 43 Street, a busy thoroughfare on the eastern city limit of Lethbridge and the northern end of Highway 4. The Red Coat Trail and CANAMEX Corridor follow Highway 4 south out of Lethbridge, while a divided Highway 3 continues east to Coaldale with a speed limit of , unlike the section west of Lethbridge which has a posted limit of 110 km/h.\n\nThe Crowsnest Highway bisects Coaldale, intersecting Highway 845 in the centre of town. The speed limit returns to 110 km/h as the divided highway continues northeast, then due east into the Municipal District of Taber. It bypasses Barnwell to the south, while the final former alignment designated as Highway 3A bisects the town. At the west end of the town of Taber, Highway 864 splits north to Vauxhall. Highway 36 then splits south to its southern end at Warner, while Highway 3 continues through the centre of Taber concurrent with Highway 36 until a signalized intersection at the east end of town where the latter splits north to Brooks.\n\nEast of Taber, the divided highway ends and the two-lane road continues east across the prairies of southern Alberta past the hamlets of Purple Springs and Grassy Lake into County of Forty Mile No. 8. After Burdett it crosses Highway 879 to the town of Bow Island. Before Seven Persons, the highway enters Cypress County and intersects Highway 887 as it veers northeast to enter the city of Medicine Hat from the southwest. It becomes a divided expressway called Gershaw Drive SW that passes north of the Medicine Hat Airport before ending at the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). Gershaw Drive continues into downtown Medicine Hat as Highway 41A.\n\nMany major highways in Alberta are predated by historic railway lines for significant portions of their length, including Highways 1, 2, 4, and 12 through 16. The inception of the trail that would become Highway 3 was similar, with the 1898 completion of a main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway spurring development in the Crowsnest Pass region. The railway connected Kootenay Landing near Creston, British Columbia to Lethbridge and was the primary method of transport until a rapid increase of private automobile use in the early 20th century. In 1926, major highways in Alberta began receiving numbers; previously all routes had been identified by coloured bands tied to telephone poles. The Red Trail officially became Highway 3 in 1932.\n\nHighway 3 has existed in Alberta on generally the same alignment since the 1910s, with only relatively minor changes made to a rough road called the Red Trail that had been carved from Medicine Hat to Crowsnest Pass. Difficult terrain on the south shore of Crowsnest Lake was a major obstacle in connecting the road to the British Columbia border. On April 29, 1903, a major rockslide buried the town of Frank and killed dozens, blocking the existing Red Trail. Work immediately began to clear the railway of debris, but a new trail north of the slide was created, connecting Frank and Bellevue. By 1906, a road had been carved through the rock to the south of the railway, replacing the temporary trail. A formal opening of the highway was held on October 8, 1917 in Blairmore. Officials had aimed for the ceremony to be held in September, but final work on the road had been delayed by the Canadian Pacific Railway who were unhappy with the location at which the highway crossed the railroad, causing the originally surveyed route to be altered. Minister of Public Works Charles Stewart had travelled from Edmonton for the event and stated that the highway was \"the only natural route\" for a trans-Canada highway, and would be in better condition if not for the difficult economic times. Canada was embroiled in World War I which ended in 1918, and gravelling of the highway began in the following years.\n\nTraffic in Alberta had always driven on the right, but British Columbia (BC) had driven on the left until 1921. The switch eliminated confusion that had been occurring on the road in the vicinity of the provincial border when traffic had to switch from one side of the road to the other. The desire for a trans-Canada route that incorporated the Red Trail continued into the 1920s with the formation of the Trans-Canada Red Trail Association. Its president, Dr. O.F. Fansett, advocated for the road to be signed as \"The Trans-Canada Red Trail\" in addition to the existing red markings, and for the route be improved to an all-weather highway. By the late 1920s, the Red Trail remained a dirt road between Medicine Hat and Taber, but work began on gravelling the Lethbridge to Macleod section in late 1928 and was completed in January 1929. Crews then moved west and began gravelling between Pincher Station and Macleod. The mountain pass into BC was not open during the winter, nor was the dirt section between Taber and Medicine Hat that had not yet been gravelled. By 1928, the highway was envisioned to be part of a trans-Canada trail that stretched from Vancouver to Halifax. A 1929 map of major highways published by the Alberta Development Board listed Highway 3 as part of a southern branch of the Trans-Canada Highway that ran from Medicine Hat to Vancouver via Princeton and Spences Bridge in BC. This route included portions of present-day Highways 5A and 8, as construction of a road connecting Princeton and Hope did not begin until 1930. The northern branch connected Medicine Hat to Banff via Calgary.\n\nWork was also on-going to upgrade the road east of Lethbridge. In 1927, the Red Trail between Coaldale and Chin was gravelled, and the upgrading continued further east to Taber in 1928. In 1929, delegates from various communities along the route met in Taber to advocate to the provincial government for gravelling of the Red Trail from Taber to Medicine Hat. The Taber to Bow Island section was completed between 1929 and 1931, and a similar meeting was held in Lethbridge in 1931 lobbying for the remainder. The group included local officials, farmers and residents who argued that the Red Trail connected key population centres and irrigation districts in southern Alberta, and was a component of an interprovincial route from Vancouver to Winnipeg. The route was better known by tourists, they claimed, and was the only highway to the west that could economically be kept open year-round. At this time, British Columbia had done work to their portion of the highway allowing it to remain open year-round so it was desirable for Alberta to follow suit. The general sentiment among southern Alberta officials was that the Red Trail was a shorter and preferable route compared to the northern branch of the Trans-Canada through Calgary. Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson in 1934 announced that the section between Bow Island and Medicine Hat would be gravelled, permitting all-weather travel for the entire length of Highway 3. Along with similar work in southern Saskatchewan and the aforementioned British Columbia work, the project created an all-weather connection across the southern prairies. Through the rubble of the Frank Slide, a new route for the highway was carved north of the railway in 1932, and paving of Highway 3 began in August 1939. The first stretch to be completed ran west from the top of the Oldman River valley hill in West Lethbridge near University Drive to Monarch.\n\nThe local road now designated as Township Road 7-0 is the historic alignment of Highway 3 across the Castle River west of Pincher Creek and immediately north of the Pincher Creek Airport. From the east, the highway paralleled the railway until Pincher Station at the junction with Highway 6, but then continued due west to cross the river approximately south of the present-day crossing. Highway 3 turned northwest, then west to pass through the south side of Lundbreck on a local road now named Township Road 7-4. West of Lundbreck, the highway briefly paralleled the Crowsnest River before crossing it near Lundbreck Falls. East of Lethbridge, Highway 3 was composed of sections of road that followed a grid system for long stretches, using only roads that ran due east or due north. Exiting Lethbridge, it followed a road now designated as Highway 512 to Coaldale, then turned north into Coaldale where it turned east. South of Tempest, it turned back north, then east near the hamlet of Chin. After following the vast majority of the present-day alignment alongside the railway to Seven Persons, it diverged from the railway and curved northeast into Medicine Hat.\n\nIn 1957, Lethbridge council met to discuss the expansion of Highway 3 between Lethbridge and Coaldale to a divided highway. Highway Minister Gordon Taylor in 1958 confirmed that Alberta would complete the project in the \"near future\" but did not have a definite timeline. Coaldale voiced opposition to an upgraded highway bypassing the town, fearing economic losses as traffic would be diverted away from the town. Citing safety and efficiency for motorists, Taylor stated that the province would prefer for major highways to not travel through towns, but extra mileage would not be created to accomplish this. Twinning work had been completed by the mid-1960s, and the divided highway bisected Coaldale. Work began in 1963 to upgrade the highway between Coaldale and Barnwell so it could carry loads up to . E.C. Lonsdale, the chairman of the Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce, stated that the region was at an economic disadvantage until the upgrade was completed. The final alignment for the upgraded highway through Barnwell had been confirmed by March 1966 with construction beginning shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1965, the Chamber pressed Taylor for further upgrades to the highway, including safety improvements to intersections and the construction of adequate shoulders. Taylor stated that the province was doing its best to improve the road, but funds were being spread among other important highway projects in the province. \"Meanwhile, you must not forget you have a completely black topped road here, one that is equal to the best roads in some of the other provinces and the United States,\" Taylor said. Nevertheless, the Chamber was still concerned about the condition of the road, particularly in the Crowsnest Pass region where mountainous terrain and steep grades were making upgrades difficult. There was also concern about the diversion of traffic from Highway 3 to the Trans-Canada Highway, which would have a negative effect on the economies of southern Alberta municipalities.\n\nHighway 3 underwent major realignment in the Lethbridge area beginning in 1966. The existing route along Westside Drive and Bridge Drive was to be replaced by a new four-lane expressway to the north, requiring new bridges over the CPR tracks and an interchange at Highway 25. Most of the interchange was built in 1966, but construction of the bridge carrying Highway 25 over the new Highway 3 lagged behind and opened the following year. The twin bridges carrying the new Highway 3 over the CPR tracks west of Lethbridge also opened in 1967, as did a trumpet interchange further east at Bridge Drive on the west bank of the Oldman River. The existing two-lane bridge over the Oldman River that had been constructed in 1946 was widened to four lanes, and a partial interchange at 5 Avenue N built by 1968 completed the realignment. Highway 3 was now twinned from Monarch to Coaldale.\nIn Medicine Hat, plans were presented to city council for an expressway upgrade to the Trans-Canada Highway in September 1968. The upgrade would include the construction of a diamond interchange at the existing intersection with Gershaw Drive (Highway 3) and the widening of Gershaw to a four-lane road. The interchange had been constructed by summer 1976, delayed several weeks by unstable terrain necessitating steel beams to supplement the concrete piles for the bridge.\n\nPlanning began in 1970 to establish a 4-lane corridor for Highway 3 near Crowsnest Pass. A route north of Coleman was first selected, later changed to the south in 1973 to avoid developed residential areas on the north side of Coleman. By the end of the decade, both the province and local municipality had endorsed the route. In the mid-1980s, the municipality asked the province to reconsider a route further to the north of Coleman, but it was deemed to be at an unacceptable grade. The alignment to the south of Coleman and Sentinel planned in the 1970s remains the preferred option for future upgrading.\n\nReconstruction of Highway 3 to a modern standard with shoulders continued in the 1970s.\nA segment from Medicine Hat to west of Severn Persons was completed in 1973, with grading for another 21.7 km west of Seven Persons done in 1974. Several local Social Credit Party Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) expressed dissatisfaction with the rate at which the work was progressing and the reasoning given by Highways Minister Clarence Copithorne. He cited a labour shortage and the fact that provincial funds were being spread across multiple projects, and also the fact that drivers should not be subjected to overly lengthy construction zones. The MLAs disagreed, saying that Alberta's oil and gas revenue should be enough to expedite Highway 3 work, and that their constituents preferred for the work to be done sooner even if it meant longer stretches of the road would be under construction at a given time.\nA group of southern Albertans called the Crowsnest Highway 3 Association met annually in the 1970s with the intent of promoting the highway and advocating to the provincial government for improvements. The group included local officials and residents who advertised Highway 3 as a rival to the Trans-Canada Highway and a more scenic route between the prairies and the west coast. Their efforts proved worthwhile; to attract travellers who might better identify with a route that has only one name, Alberta officially renamed Highway 3 as \"Crowsnest Highway 3\" in 1977 with British Columbia following suit for their portion through to Hope. Members of the Association collaborated with the government on new highway shields, a sign that denotes the designated number of the highway. They began to appear in both provinces by the end of the decade. British Columbia had its own shield and in Alberta two versions of the shield were initially erected; a white number 3 on a crow background within the shield, and a more standard Alberta highway shield with the usual black number on a white background, but with a crow perched on top peering down at the number. The first variant prevailed and remains unchanged through the 2010s. Long-term planning for a Highway 3 expressway was on-going near the end of the decade, with minor changes to the two-lane route near the BC border in the late 1970s.\n\nAt their 1979 meeting in Lethbridge, the Association pushed for wider recognition and advertisement of the Crowsnest route in tourism offices across Canada, and also hoped for the Crowsnest moniker to be expanded to include the Trans-Canada Highway from Medicine Hat to the Saskatchewan border. They would later create a 16-page brochure that highlighted points of interest along the Crowsnest Highway en route to Expo 86, a world's fair held in Vancouver in October 1986, again presenting it as a better alternative to the Trans-Canada Highway. In 1979, a group similarly lobbied for a named highway across the southern prairies including Alberta Highway 501 and Saskatchewan Highway 13. The Crowsnest efforts were used as an example of the traffic that could be brought to a route when it has a cohesive name.\n\nPrior to construction of the Crowsnest Trail expressway in Lethbridge, the highway crossed the Oldman River then curved south underneath the High Level Bridge, following portions of 1 Avenue and 3 Avenue downtown. After several years of planning, a $50 million realignment of Highway 3 through the centre of the city was presented to city council by Calgary engineers in September 1981, receiving favourable comments. The new corridor was designated as one of several \"Major Continuous Corridors\" in the province. It involved the construction of a new four-lane expressway from 43 Street to the existing Highway 3 on the east bank of the Oldman River between North and West Lethbridge, and new interchanges at 5 Avenue N and Scenic Drive. The relocation of a Canadian Pacific Railway yard from downtown Lethbridge was required; it was moved to Kipp, west of Coalhurst. Construction was estimated to be completed by 1985, with the province paying for 90% of the project and the city covering the remaining 10%. Land acquisition was to cost between $2 and $12 million. Work began in 1983 and was completed in 1986. Interchanges were constructed on Crowsnest Trail at Stafford Drive, 13 Street and Mayor Magrath Drive at a cost of more than $50 million.\n\nBefore the four-lane bypass south of Monarch across the Oldman River was constructed, Highway 3 passed through Monarch and crossed the river southwest of the town on a bridge built in 1957. This stretch is now designated as Highway 3A. The interchange at Highway 3A (then Highway 3) and Highway 23 near Monarch was completed in 1984. Highway 23 had been shifted slightly west to eliminate two 90° bends in the route near Nobleford. The new interchange was initially criticized for being confusing, causing many drivers to make wrong turns. Counter-intuitively, traffic continuing westbound through the interchange on Highway 3 exited to the right, passing underneath Highway 23. Southbound traffic on Highway 23 turning west onto Highway 3 had to turn left across the westbound lanes to access the aforementioned single lane ramp. Macleod MLA LeRoy Fjordbotten promised improved signage and lighting for the interchange in early 1984. Fort Macleod Mayor Wes Olmstead was concerned that the interchange, along with upgrades of Highways 519 and 520, encouraged northbound traffic to use Highway 23 instead of continuing west to his community and using Highway 2. The towns of Pincher Creek and Nanton had similar concerns about the diversion of traffic caused by the new interchange. Transport Minister Henry Kroeger disagreed and thought the concerns were unwarranted; of Fort Macleod, he stated, \"the town won't disappear as a result of the interchange.\" Alberta had long-term plans for Highway 23 to be twinned, and for the Monarch interchange to be expanded to a partial cloverleaf. The possibility of a southern Monarch bypass had already been identified by the mid-1980s.\n\nAn announcement for the construction of passing lanes on the two-lane Highway 3 between Monarch and Fort Macleod came in 1985, though Fort Macleod Mayor Olmstead stated the project was simply delaying the inevitable twinning that would be required for the route. He remained concerned about the loss of traffic to his community caused by the Monarch interchange, and was confident that twinning of Highways 2 and 3 would offset the loss. Twinning of both routes continued in the late 1980s.\n\nA bypass of Blairmore was completed in October 1983 after more than a year of construction. The highway was formerly routed down Main Street of the community (20 Avenue) at a reduced speed limit. At the east end of Blairmore, a new bridge over the Crowsnest River was constructed, and the highway curves north around the community before rejoining the existing alignment west of the town. The $3.9 million project was estimated to save almost 15 minutes of driving time through Blairmore. Alberta Transportation estimated that work on a Coleman bypass would likely proceed within five years, but this did not come to fruition.\n\nIn 1989, Alberta announced plans to twin the entire length of the Export Highway, a name given to the southern portion of Alberta's north-south trade corridor that includes Highway 2 from Calgary to Fort Macleod, Highway 3 between Fort Macleod and Lethbridge, and the entire length of Highway 4 from Lethbridge to the United States border. The plan was for Highway 2 to be twinned first, followed by Highway 3 then 4. Highway 3 required twinning only from Fort Macleod to Monarch, as the remainder to Lethbridge had already been completed. Work included the construction of two new steel bridges over the Oldman River in 1996 which formed a bypass to the south of Monarch. The former alignment of the highway through Monarch was re-designated as Highway 3A, relegating the previously controversial interchange at Highway 23 to service of local Monarch traffic. Travellers continuing west on Highway 3 toward Fort Macleod from Lethbridge no longer had to exit the highway and reduce their speed to navigate a single lane ramp, and were not at risk of missing the exit and accidentally proceeding north on Highway 23 toward Vulcan. Twinning on Highway 3 west of Monarch continued into 1997 and was completed at a cost of $31 million.\n\nThough Alberta had prioritized the Export Highway, twinning work was also progressing east of Coaldale in the mid-1990s. Alberta Transportation minister Steve West announced in 1995 that Barnwell would not be bypassed, and the twinned highway would instead continue on its existing alignment through the centre of the village at a reduced speed limit. Some members of the community opposed the decision, citing increased vehicular safety of the recommended bypass alignment south of the village, and a safer environment for pedestrians who would not have to cross highway traffic. Representatives from Barnwell acknowledged that bypassing the town might be detrimental to growth of the community. Local MLA Ron Hierath stated that residents who lived north of the old highway were in favour of the bypass being constructed to the south of the town, while residents on the south side preferred the alignment through the centre of the town. Amidst the controversy, the decision was later reversed by West, and the twinned Highway 3 was constructed south of Barnwell with the former alignment designated as Highway 3A. After a slight delay in 1995, twinning continued in 1996 and had been completed to Cranford by the end of 1997, and to Taber by the end of the decade. In 1999, Infrastructure minister Ed Stelmach stated that twinning the remainder of the highway from Taber to Medicine Hat was not a priority, despite pleas from local officials.\n\nAlberta Transportation has long-term plans to upgrade the entire length of Highway 3 to a freeway, requiring major bypasses of Fort Macleod and Lethbridge. The proposed route for the Lethbridge bypass would split from Highway 3 west of Coalhurst, running north past the town to a new interchange at Highway 25. It would continue east across the Oldman River on new bridges, bypassing Lethbridge to reach a newly extended Highway 4 (temporarily designated as Highway 4X) northeast of Lethbridge. It would rejoin the existing highway east of Chin. A freeway upgrade of Crowsnest Trail was considered, but would require extensive reconstruction and demolition within the corridor through Lethbridge, and twinning of the existing bridge across the Oldman River. The city of Lethbridge expressed their disapproval of this alignment, eliminating it early in the study process.\n\nA functional planning study was completed in 2008 to identify the optimal alignment for the Fort Macleod bypass. The preferred alignment has the new Highway 3, temporarily designated as Highway 3X, splitting southeast from the existing Highway 3, west of the intersection with Highway 810. It would meet a newly extended Highway 2 at an interchange southwest of Fort Macleod before continuing to a second interchange with the existing two-lane section of Highway 2 between Fort Macleod and Cardston. Stage 1 of the project would include only the Highway 2 bypass, with the extension to Highway 3 west of Highway 810 completed in Stage 2. A Medicine Hat bypass of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) is also proposed, which would involve the construction of a large interchange with directional flyovers at Highway 3 and the newly realigned Highway 1 southwest of Medicine Hat.\n\nA 2004 study assessed the reduction of accesses to Highways 3 and 36 in Taber as a stopgap measure until a bypass of the town is constructed. Highway 3 currently has a speed limit of and seven at-grade intersections in Taber. In April 2008, Alberta Transportation published a study analyzing twinning and potential changes to the alignments of Highways 3 and 6 in the vicinity of Pincher Creek, including the construction of a diamond interchange at Highway 6. Residents who could be affected by the changed routes were consulted as part of the study.\n\nIn 2010, a study plotted the routing of a bypass to the north of Seven Persons with plans for a diamond interchange at Highway 887. A 2013 study identified the preferred alignment for a freeway bypass of Burdett and Bow Island, likely to be operated as a divided expressway until the freeway is completed long-term. Both towns would be bypassed to the south, with an interchange constructed at Highway 879.\n\n\n"}

The venue is currently home of HŠK Zrinjski Mostar. Today it has a capacity of 9,000 seats, and before the stadiums's conversion to an all-seater venue, its capacity exceeded 25,000.\n\nThe stadium is situated in the city's center, in the neighborhood of Bijeli Brijeg, on the west bank of the Neretva river.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1958 with the public subsidies, and volunteering construction works by all denizens of Mostar, particularly students, and it served as the home ground of Velež Mostar during SFR Yugoslavia era. During the Bosnian War, between 1992 and 1995, and in particular subsequent incitement of Croat-Bosniak hostilities, the city of Mostar was effectively split to two parts, western (Croat) and eastern (Bosniak), divided around the river Neretva. The stadium sustained heavy damage during the war, while conflicting ideologies and interests were conveyed from the war times into the post-war era, evidenced in continuous and steady political divisiveness in the city of Mostar, among other, in issues of territorial and ownership disputes. Such political ambiance showed in the forced eviction of FK Velež Mostar from its traditional home-ground of stadium \"Pod Bijelim Brijegom\", and subsequent political and public disputes over stadium usurpation by another club, emerging in the city at the beginning of the war in 1992, namely HŠK Zrinjski Mostar, one of three city's ethno-national football organizations banned by the former Yugoslav government immediately after the World War II. From that moment onward stadium serves solely as the home ground of Zrinjski Mostar. \n\nFK Velež Mostar used stadium \"Pod Bijelim Brijegom\" from the time it was built until 1992, through the club's glory days, when they emerged triumphant from their campaigns in the 1981 and 1986 Yugoslav Cups competition, and before that when the club also reached the quarter-final stage of the 1974–75 UEFA Cup. People around Velež Mostar club, supporters, as well as aficionados of this cult club around former Yugoslavia, public figures, including number of Croatian intellectuals, continuously advocate for Velež's return to its original stadium, however, so far these calls fall on deaf ears with the city's administration, who often citing political and security issues to continue blocking of Velež's return. The club currently plays at the Rođeni Stadium which was built in 1995.\n\nBijeli Brijeg is the second largest stadium in Bosnia and Herzegovina, after Koševo stadium in Sarajevo. The club HŠK Zrinjski administration changed the stadium name into \"Stadion HŠK Zrinjski\" () and registered it with the Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the club's games under the association's auspices.\n"}

Sigsbee (1845–1923).\n\n\"Sigsbee\" was laid down on 22 July 1942 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; launched on 7 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. A. O. Fischer; and commissioned on 23 January 1943, Commander Benjamin V. Russell in command.\n\n\"Sigsbee\" completed outfitting three weeks later and sailed to Casco Bay, Maine, for 10 days of gunnery and torpedo practice before sailing to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to complete her shakedown. She returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York City, for post-shakedown overhaul. Upon completion, the destroyer escorted \"Birmingham\" (CL-62) to Norfolk. On 4 April, she escorted two tankers to Casco Bay and returned. Next was an escort trip with \"Independence\" (CV-22) and \"Guest\" (DD-472) to Trinidad, B.W.I., where the aircraft carrier trained her air group. Upon her return to Norfolk, \"Sigsbee\" refueled and with \"Guest\" and \"Earle\" (DD-635) escorted \"Lexington\" (CV-16) to Trinidad arriving on 16 May.\n\nOn 8 June, the destroyer was detached from the group and proceeded independently to New York. \"Sigsbee\" operated between New York, Casco Bay, and Norfolk until 22 July. On that date, the destroyer, with \"Harrison\" (DD-573), \"Daly\" (DD-519), and \"Lexington\", stood out of Norfolk en route to Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal. The canal was transited on 27 July, and \"Sigsbee\" arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 August.\n\nIn mid-August, \"Sigsbee\" joined the task group built around carriers \"Yorktown\" (CV-10), \"Essex\" (CV-9), and \"Independence\" (CVL-22) commanded by Rear Admiral Charles Alan Pownall for raids against Marcus Island in which considerable damage was done to enemy installations. \"Sigsbee\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 September 1943.\n\n\"Sigsbee\" was off Wake Island three weeks later and participated in the bombardment of that island on 5 October.\n\nOn 21 October, the destroyer stood out of Pearl Harbor en route to Efate, New Hebrides. She arrived on 5 November and spent the next two weeks in training with transports. On 13 November, \"Sigsbee\" sortied with Task Unit 53.1.4 (TU 53.1.4) for the Gilbert Islands. On 22 and 23 November, she bombarded Betio, at Tarawa Atoll. She then returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 December for a yard availability period.\n\nOn 22 January 1944, \"Sigsbee\" sailed out of Pearl Harbor with Task Force 52 (TF 52) to participate in the assault and capture of Kwajalein, Marshall Islands. The destroyer bombarded Ennylabegan Island on the morning of 31 January and, that evening, \"Sigsbee\" and \"Ringgold\" (DD-500) entered the lagoon to protect American shipping and provide call-fire for troops ashore. The destroyer remained in the Marshall Islands until 1 March when she departed for Efate. \"Sigsbee\" sortied from there, on 20 March, with TF 37 to participate in the bombardment of Kavieng, New Ireland.\n\nIn April, \"Sigsbee\" patrolled the entrance to Humboldt Bay until the 26th when she screened a convoy to Cape Cretin. After patrolling in the Guadalcanal area for several weeks, \"Sigsbee\" joined TU 53.1.14 to take part in the Marianas campaign. The destroyer bombarded the Guam beaches during the period 16 to 18 July as well as covering the underwater demolition teams (UDTs) on the beaches. She then joined the picket screen and remained off Guam until 3 August. \"Sigsbee\" returned to Humboldt Bay for a month and then joined TF 77, proceeded to Morotai Island, North Moluccas, and provided fire support for the landings on Cape Podangi in mid-September.\n\n\"Sigsbee\" returned to Humboldt Bay and was assigned to TF 78. The force sortied on 3 October for the assault and landings on Leyte, P.I., on the 20th. After the invasion of Leyte, the destroyer sailed for San Francisco and an overhaul, arriving there on 15 November 1944. \"Sigsbee\" was back in Pearl Harbor on 19 January 1945 and then sailed for Ulithi where she joined TF 58, the Fast Carrier Task Force.\n\nOn 16 February, the task force launched air strikes against Japan and Okinawa in support of the landings on Iwo Jima. On 14 March, the fast carriers and \"Sigsbee\" again steamed out of Ulithi for air strikes against the Japanese home islands to neutralize the airfields in preparation for the forthcoming assault on Okinawa. The destroyer then joined the radar picket ships off that island and remained there until 14 April. On that date, the destroyer was struck aft of her number five gun by a kamikaze suicide plane. The port engine was knocked out of commission, the starboard engine could only be run at five knots, steering control was lost, and the ship began to take on water. Commander Gordon Pai'ea Chung-Hoon in command of \"Sigsbee\" continued to fight his ship and direct anti-aircraft fire, while at the same time directing damage control parties that saved his ship. Twenty-three sailors were killed in the attack.\n\n\"Sigsbee\" was towed south to Guam (out of the battle area) where she was sufficiently repaired for the long tow back to Pearl Harbor (via Eniwetok). The destroyer arrived there on 7 June 1945 and had a complete new 60-foot stern installed. Ready for sea again, the ship sailed out of port on 28 September en route to the east coast of the United States. On 22 October, she arrived at Philadelphia. The following week, the ship moved to Charleston to prepare for inactivation.\n\nOn 1 May 1946, the destroyer was placed in commission, in reserve. On 31 March 1947, \"Sigsbee\" was placed in reserve, out of commission, with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 1 December 1974, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and on 31 July 1975 the ship was sold and broken up for scrap.\n\n\"Sigsbee\" was awarded 11 battle stars for World War II service.\n\n"}

Sharp Associates (IPSA) was a major Canadian computer time-sharing, consulting and services firm of the 1970s and 1980s. IPSA is well known for its work on the programming language APL, an early packet switching computer network named IPSANET, and a powerful mainframe computer-based email system named 666 Box, stylized as 666 BOX. It was purchased in 1987 by Reuters Group, which used them until 2005 as a data warehousing center for business data.\n\nThe company's founders worked as a team at the Toronto division of Ferranti, Ferranti-Packard, which sold many products to the Canadian military and large businesses. The team worked on operating system and compiler design for the company's range of mainframe computers, the Ferranti-Packard 6000. In 1964 Ferranti sold off its computing division to International Computers and Tabulators, which almost immediately closed the Toronto office. Ian Sharp, the chief programmer, founded I. P. Sharp Associates in December 1964 with the other members of the team (Roger Moore, Ted McDorman, Don Smith, David Oldacre, Brian Daly, and James McSherry) and David Butler shortly after.\n\nThe firm began with contract programming on IBM System/360 series mainframes, and to some degree took over Ferranti's former military work. It became particularly well used by the Canadian Navy, setting up an office in Ottawa near DND headquarters. Ted McDorman and Jim McSherry were lead players in this. At one point IPSA could claim to have played a part in every computer system onboard Canadian Navy ships.\n\nIn the early years, IPSA collaborated with its sister company Scientific Time Sharing Corporation (STSC) of Bethesda, Maryland, USA, each retailing the same services in their respective countries. IPSA and STSC jointly developed their software. Eventually they devised separate product names. They separated as Sharp APL and APL*Plus. Initially, IPSA served STSC's customers from its Toronto datacenter. In 1972, STSC built its own datacenter. Afterward, both firms provided disaster recovery for each other: if one of the datacenters could not function, the other datacenter would accommodate both vendors' users.\n\nIPSA sold time on its mainframes by the minute to customers across Canada, and rapidly developed into a major time sharing service in the 1970s. Long before the Internet, IPSA developed IPSANET to provide cheap telecommunications between the Toronto data center and IPSA clients across North America and Europe. Packet-switching also made their transatlantic links much more usable, since on previous equipment, frequent \"line hits\" would produce user-visible errors. As the network grew, and as Sharp APL was available on in-house computers, Sharp clients with their own mainframes could join the network, access their own or the Toronto mainframe from anywhere on IPSANET, and transfer data accordingly. The network eventually provided \"Network Shared Variables\" that allowed programs running on one mainframe to communicate in realtime with programs on another mainframe. This was used for file transfer and email services.\n\nI. P. Sharp Associates offered timesharing users access to a variety of databases, plus sophisticated packages for statistical analysis, forecasting, reporting, and graphing data. Databases included historical stock market time series data, econometric data, and airline data. All of these were available from the \"39 MAGIC\" workspace, an easy-to-use time series, query, and reporting language, which among other things featured integrated high-quality business graphics from \"Superplot\". In 1982, IPSA produced its first printed catalog of all online databases and proceeded to document for its customers the content and use of single databases or sets of databases.\n\nIPSA was heavily involved in the development of the APL language, eventually employing APL's inventor, Ken Iverson, in the early 1980s. Roger Moore, a company co-founder and vice-president, won the 1973 Grace Murray Hopper Award for the development of APL\\360 (along with Larry Breed and Dick Lathwell). APL\\360 was later greatly enhanced and extended to become Sharp APL, stylized as SHARP APL.\n\nIPSA employed a team of expert APL implementors and contributors at its head office in Toronto: including Ian Sharp, in his role as enabler, Roger Moore, Dick Lathwell, Brian Daly in his role as marketing guy in Ottawa, Bob Bernecky, Leigh O. Clayton, Doug Forkes, Dave Markwick, and Peter Wooster. This group was headed by Eric B. Iverson, Ken Iverson's son. It was affectionately termed the \"Zoo\" and was well-respected inside and outside the firm. The term \"Zoo\" is attributed to a visitor from The Establishment who witnessed the long hair, beards, and unconventional dress of some in the team. Sharp APL and APL Plus, and variants, were all based on the XM6 IBM program. Further extensive APL development was done in Toronto and elsewhere.\n\nLater, in the 1980s, a branch office in Palo Alto, California, managed by Paul L. Jackson, made significant contributions to APL and later J. This office included Joey Tuttle, Roland Pesch, and Eugene McDonnell.\n\n666 Box, written in APL, was one of the first commercial email services, known colloquially by its users as the \"Sharp Mailbox\". The original 666 Box was written by Larry Breed of STSC. It was later rewritten for higher security by a student hacker from Lower Canada College, Leslie H. Goldsmith. Eventually it was extended to support transferring email among multiple domains (mainframes) over the IPSANET.\n\nThe profitable timesharing business started to deteriorate in mid-1982, as some key timesharing clients moved their operations from timesharing to in-house Sharp APL. Around that time, IBM started offering smaller mainframes, such as the IBM 4300 series, which could be leased for less than the cost of using external services. Clients who did not depend on the network were the first to migrate to small mainframes. Initially, the presence of the IBM PC posed little threat to the timesharing industry as the computing power and storage capacity offered by these small machines was insufficient. A major part of Sharp's business was buttressed by database business, which had the beneficial effect of delaying the eventual downslide. STSC started to feel the effects of the deteriorating timesharing market one or two years earlier.\n\nSharp was active in the field of developing APL interpreters for the IBM PC and other computers. Their IBM PC implementation was based on a software IBM System/370 emulator, written by Roger Moore, which ran the mainframe Sharp APL executable on the PC. This product was only used by users exposed to mainframe Sharp APL, never enjoying the commercial success of STSC's APL*Plus/PC product. Sharp also offered their APL interpreter for PC-XT/370 hardware, essentially an IBM PC/XT with IBM 370 hardware emulation cards, but the PC/370 hardware never caught on. Later, Sharp released the SAX (Sharp APL for Unix) interpreter, based on STSC's APL*Plus UNX interpreter, which was a much more complete implementation of Iverson's APL extensions. As of 2016, SAX is available from Soliton Incorporated. \n\nReuters purchased I. P. Sharp Associates in 1987, partly for the historic financial data. Ian Sharp continued as president until 1989, when he retired. In 1993, IPSA's \"APL Software Division\" was purchased by its employees from Reuters and renamed Soliton. Reuters closed the Toronto facility in 2005.\n\nIPSA served an important role as an incubator for entrepreneurs and technologists, including:\n\n\n\n"}

MACW, also known as Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), was purchased by Turner Broadcasting System in 1988, and subsequently renamed WCW. In March 2001, certain assets of WCW were sold by AOL Time Warner to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). As such these assets, including the rights to the WCW World Television Championship, inactive since April 10, 2000, were now WWF property. Before it was known as the WCW World Television Championship (starting in 1991 and continuing until the title's deactivation), it was known as the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship (1974 to 1977), the NWA Television Championship (1977 to 1985), and the NWA World Television Championship (1985 to 1991).\n\nBeing a professional wrestling championship, it was won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. All title changes occurred at JCP or WCW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Danny Miller, who defeated Ole Anderson on February 27, 1974, in the finals of a tournament. Booker T holds the record for most reigns, with six. Rick Steamboat's second reign ended due to vacancy for unknown reasons. The day on which the reign ended is also unknown, although it is known that the reign began on June 10, 1978, and came to a close sometime in 1980. As such, if the reign ended on January 1, 1980, or any later time during 1980, then Steamboat's second reign is the longest in the title's history, at over 570 days. Five different reigns are tied for the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at one day.\n\nJim Duggan was the last champion in his only reign. At the time, then-champion Scott Hall did not want to be champion, and after unsuccessfully trying to give the title to Kevin Nash, he abandoned the title by throwing the championship belt into a trashcan on the November 29, 1999, episode of one of WCW's television programs, \"Nitro\". Duggan later found the championship belt in a dumpster on the February 16, 2000, episode of another of WCW's television programs, \"WCW Saturday Night\" and named himself champion. The championship was later retired on the April 10, 2000, episode of \"Nitro\", after a storyline reboot by WCW authority figures Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo. Overall, there were 107 reigns shared among 55 wrestlers, with 11 vacancies.\n\n\n"}

Adult males are fully winged, while females have conspicuous wing pads (actually short wings like that of the female oriental cockroach), which are functionless. Wings of the male are longer than its body, while wing pads of the female cover only one-third to two-thirds of the abdomen. The males fly swiftly but do not have the ability to sustain themselves in the air for long periods.\n\nThe species occurs in open, timbered areas with little ground cover. According to entomologist Fred A. Lawson, it is \"often seen on tree trunks and lower branches of oaks and elms after dark.\" Nymphs and adults are also found outdoors beneath loose bark in woodpiles, stumps, and hollow trees. Brought indoors on infested firewood, they wander about the house without congregating in any particular room. They can be especially troublesome during the mating season, which is during May and June. Male wood cockroaches frequently travel in large numbers and fly considerable distances. They are attracted to lights at night and may gain entry indoors. Large numbers may also be found in rain gutters of homes.\n\nPennsylvania wood cockroaches feed primarily on decaying organic matter. Both female and male Pennsylvania wood cockroaches have been found under shingles and on the inside of garages. They rarely breed indoors. However, with the growing use of firewood, the popularity of cedar shake shingles, and the continual building of homes in wooded areas, problems with Pennsylvania wood cockroaches will probably escalate.\n\nThe Pennsylvania wood cockroach has three developmental stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Eggs are laid in egg capsules, produced during the warm months and deposited behind the loose bark of dead trees, fallen logs, or stumps. Egg capsules are yellowish brown and characteristically curved on both sides like a half moon. Capsules are twice as long as wide, each containing up to 32 eggs. The egg stage lasts about 34 days at 80 °F, while the nymphal stage typically lasts 10 to 12 months but can last up to 2 years. The normal life span of the female adult is several months.\n\nThe distribution of the species includes southeastern Canada, in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and the eastern and central United States, in Alabama, the District of Columbia, probably Florida, Georgia,Virginia,Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\nA 1966 article said that it is the only species of cockroach that is definitely native to Ontario, while a 1987 update also included \"Parcoblatta virginica\" and \"Parcoblatta uhleriana\" as indigenous to the province.\n\nPennsylvania wood cockroaches are most often carried into homes under the bark of firewood. It is best to not store firewood inside the house. Move woodpiles away from the house to further reduce the likelihood of cockroaches wandering in.\n\nHouses located within woods will sometimes have wood cockroaches crawl under siding; especially homes with cedar shake shingles. To cockroaches, the house may represent a fallen tree and a new location for nesting. A wide lawn will inhibit cockroaches crawling from the surrounding woods to the house. The use of window screening and caulking to prevent entry is a good structural tactic.\n\nThe species frequently invades summer cottages, and while it is considered a nuisance, it is rarely in enough numbers to be considered a pest.\n\nAs breeding populations rarely become established indoors, house interiors should not be treated. Treat exteriors only when wood cockroaches enter homes from the surrounding environment.\n\nExterior treatments to foundations, around doors and windows, porches, patios and other areas where outside lights are located will help control both the adult males (which will fly to the lights) and the females (which crawl to the house in search of harborage).\n\n\n"}

It was released in 2005. An enhanced port of the game for PlayStation Portable titled \"Phantom Kingdom Portable\" was released in Japan on October 6, 2011. It included a new scenario called \"\"Papa is the Strongest Overlord in the Universe\"\" and added battles with Valvatorez and Fenrich from \"\".\n\nThe main characters of Makai Kingdom are Overlords, beings of godlike power who rule over pocket universes called Netherworlds that also appear in the \"Disgaea\" series.\n\nThe protagonist is Zetta, a self-proclaimed \"Bad-ass Freakin' Overlord\". Other main characters include Pram the Oracle, a young overlord who can see the future, Alexander, God of Destruction, who wields thunder-based powers and considers Zetta his rival, Demon Overlord Seedle, a former samurai, Salome the Traitor, Zetta's former pupil, and Trenia, a mysterious girl with an unknown identity.\n\nAfter the destruction of his Netherworld is prophesied by Pram the Oracle, Overlord Zetta travels to the Forbidden Library to prevent it. Finding the Sacred Tome, a book that controls reality, Zetta finds a passage claiming that his own stupidity would be the downfall of his Netherworld. Infuriated, he burns the book, only to remember immediately afterwards that destroying the book would destroy his world. He quickly responds by confining his soul to the Sacred Tome and ventures to rewrite his world into existence by having the other Overlords of Netherworlds write wishes within his pages.\n\nAfter fighting through a number of different Netherworlds, Zetta is supposedly fatally cursed by a godlike being known as The One. Soon after, his lost former pupil, Salome, asks him to marry her. Traveling to her Netherworld, Zetta fatally wounds Salome in battle. However, she reveals that she was already dying beforehand. The true strongest Overlord, Salome was giving all of her Mana to Zetta in secret due to her unrequited love for him. Realizing this, Zetta asks Pram to revive Salome, but she is thwarted by the vengeful Overlord Seedle. Alexander defeats Seedle, but Zetta is left without hope of reviving Salome or returning to his body.\n\nHowever, Trenia reveals herself to be the spirit of the Sacred Tome that was exiled from the book when Zetta put himself into it. Believing that Zetta has learned his lesson and become a more humble person, she confines herself back into the Sacred Tome, giving him back his body and full power. Zetta then proceeds to revive Salome using his immense power. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the curse of The One is fake, and that the true The One is actually Ophelia. \n\nThe gameplay is somewhat similar to the gameplay found in \"Phantom Brave\" and \"\", other games created by Nippon Ichi. The characters summoned in battle have freedom to move within a circle set by the characters' movement points. Victory is achieved by scoring a set number of points, which are given by interacting with items on the map, discovering extension maps, and eliminating enemies. Several of the classes from \"Disgaea: Hour of Darkness\" exist in this game as well, such as Warrior and Mage, but some of the equivalents of previous classes are different. Some classes also have distinctions between sexes.\n\nThere are a variety of weapon types, each with their own expansive sets. Characters can equip armor and various other accessories to aid in combat. Each class has four weapon types in which they are proficient, and can learn new moves to use in combat as characters master the weapons.\n\nVehicles are a new addition from previous Nippon Ichi games. They are similar to moving, battle-capable buildings. They vary in size, shape, and purpose, but are generally faster than travelling on foot. Vehicles can damage opponents and can level-up. However, levelling a vehicle is different from levelling a character. Leveling up high ranked vehicles is difficult, and in actuality, impossible to raise them to 9999, as the cost will effectively be more than the player can ever make.\n\nMany of maps are randomly generated. While, in many cases, the first map in a storyline mission is pre-set, the \"extensions\" to the map are often randomly generated. The randomly generated maps creates the potential to have vastly different situations even when replaying the same map. Within the game, there are two separate types of extensions: \"Locked\" and \"Secret\". While both extensions can be revealed by throwing something out of bounds into the extension, \"Locked\" extensions can also be unlocked by destroying a specific unit on the field, which is marked with an icon saying \"Key\".\n\nOnce an extension is revealed, there may occasionally be \"special events\" which occur as soon as the extension is unlocked. While many special events simply affect the enemies that appear in the extension, others will paralyze everyone on the battlefield, put everyone to sleep, or other effects.\n\nhttps://nisamerica.com/games/MK/index.html\n\nhttps://nisamerica.com/\n\n"}

It serves as the municipal seat of Camargo municipality and also serves as an important agricultural and livestock center for the area. Ciudad Camargo was originally founded in 1740 and refounded in 1792.\n\nIn the upper part of the city's Coat of Arms, the following terms appear: \"TRABAJO 1792 NOBLEZA\" (\"Work-1792-Nobility\"), which represents the original motto of the city and its refounding date. It appears above a profile of the mountains along the Conchos River. In the center is the figure of a Spaniard on horseback; below that, the historic Municipal Presidency building and the head of a Tarahumara Indian wearing a collar appear facing each other, seen in profile. These figures are flanked by smoking chimneys that symbolize the industry of the city. The lower part displays a walnut tree planted at the confluence of two rivers, which flow downward to a cross rising from a sun in which Apache arrows appear, symbolizing the depopulation of the old settlement of the region by the attack of these indigenous groups. Under the left river branch, agriculture is represented with a pheasant; under the right river branch, livestock is represented with a cow skull.\n\nA sheath of maize appears along each side of the shield. On the lower apex of the shield appears the city's name: SANTA ROSALÍA DE CAMARGO.\n\nThe lands located between the existing town of San Francisco de Conchos and the confluence of the Río Concho and Río Florido rivers were explored by Francisco Escárcega on June 12, 1687, at the direction of the Governor of Nueva Vizcaya, Don José de Neyra y Quiroga. In 1740, the site at the confluence of the Río Concho and Río Parral rivers was established as a town with the name of Santa Rosalía for the Catholic missionaries who were assigned to administer in the area.\n\nIn 1745, Apache raiders from further north began looting and terrorizing Spanish settlements through the entire Allende Valley. They attacked the town of San Francisco de Conchos on March 25, when they killed the Franciscan missionary friars Tomás de Zigarán and Francisco de Labado who served the mission. They also burned the church and the friars' house. The Apaches then immediately attacked the town of San Pedro de Conchos; there, the missionary left before befalling any harm and took refuge with the Jesuits in Satevó. From Valle de Allende, the friars and Spanish residents were evacuated to Villa López before the raiders arrived; but they were unable to prevent the Apache from burning the convent and the sanctuary.\n\nGeneral Francisco Montaño de la Cueva led the campaign against the insurgents, rounding them up and immediately imposing the peace. But he hanged thirteen of the native leaders determined to be responsible for the uprising and the death of the missionaries in the Allende Valley.\n\nThe attacks of the Apache raiders caused an abandonment of the town, but it was re-established and repopulated on November 25, 1792 with the same name of Santa Rosalía by the Captain Jose Manuel Ochoa, taking orders from General Pedro de Nava, General Commander of the Internal Provinces. The town was re-established with 28 neighbors brought from the Presidio of Conchos, which continued to impose oversight and control over the town until 1820, when the town was given the category of Municipality under the restored Spanish Constitution of Cádiz. In 1826, the community was made part of the political district of Rosales; in 1837, it was included in the sub-prefecture of Jiménez; in 1847, included in the Cantón Jiménez; in 1859, separated to create the Canton Camargo; and from 1887 to 1911, it was included in the Camargo District. In 1897, after 100 years of life, at the request of the Camargan deputy Pedro Carbajal, the local Congress granted the community the title of City with the name of Camargo in honor of the Caudillo insurgent Ignacio Camargo who was shot in Chihuahua during the War of Independence on May 10, 1811.\n\nOn August 31, 1860 in Santa Rosalía, Captain Jesus Duarte, with a section of Liberal troops, defeated the Conservative leader Jose Macias, who was left lying on the field with 32 dead and several wounded.\n\nOn September 1, 1876, Mayor José Perfecto Lomelín, declared the local government to be in favor of the Tuxtepec Plan and occupied the Plaza de Camargo, which had previously been under the control of Governor Manuel de Herrera and the Chihuahua National Guard.\n\nOn April 23, 1913, Constitutionalist Generals Manuel Chao, Rosalío Hernández and Maclovio Herrera attacked the Plaza de Camargo that had become occupied by Huerta troops under the command of General Manuel García Pueblita. The Constitutionalist troops were defeated, leaving the Plaza and the City in the hands of the assailants.\n\nOn December 12, 1916, General Francisco Villa attacked and captured the Plaza de Camargo, defended by General Rosalío Hernández with government troops from where they were evicted. All the captured prisoners were shot on Villa's orders.\n\nOn January 5, 2017 at the Camargo toll booth on State Highway 45, about a thousand citizens demonstrated against the \"gasolinazo\" (gasoline tax rise). The State Police were dispatched to end the demonstration; when they arrived, rather than confronting the officers, the demonstrators raised their hands in mass to show that they did not carry weapons, then sat down and sang the National Anthem with one voice. The act was unprecedented in national history.\n\nCarmargo has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSh\") with mild winters and hot summers. The average high in hottest month is while the average low is . Winters are mild with an average high of and an average low of in January. Precipitation is sparse though it is higher from July to September.\n\nThe Camargo's Municipality has 248 \"Colonias\" (neighborhoods) and \"Zonas Conurbadas\" which make the entire city.\n\nCamargo is ethnically diverse, but mostly of European origin, composed primarily of Spanish mestizos, Basque, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Mennonites, South African Boers, and Conchos Indians.\nAs of 2010, the city had a total population of 40,221, up from 39,149 as of 2005.\n\nTourism is a popular activity and a generating potential of currencies, because Camargo City and vicinity possesses a great number of natural attractions, the most popular being:\n\n\nBesides tourism, The region is known for agriculture, cattle, corn, pecan trees and its surrounding mountains. Wheat, sorghum, cotton, soy bean, maize (corn), beans, chilis, alfalfa, and onions are all grown in the area. Nuts, grapes, apricots, watermelon, melons, pears, plums, and peaches are also grown there.\n\nThe Tarahumara Indians living up in the mountains outside of the city regularly come into Ciudad Camargo to sell produce and other goods to the local populace.\n\n\n"}

It is a mostly uniform pale brownish-yellow, with sometimes darker pronotum (the plate behind the head) and legs, and usually dark brown cerci (the pair of appendages on its rear-most segment). Its pronotum is subelliptical (nearly elliptical), is widest just behind its middle, and has weakly defined disc-like impressions.\n\nThe female head and pronotum are usually a pale reddish-brown, its short tegmina are reddish brown with paler sides, its abdominal segments are a darker brown, and its legs and underside are a brownish yellow.\n\nThe species' ootheca (egg case) is bean-shaped, very dark brown, and measures about long by wide. The edge with a seam is curved and has about 40 small crimps or folds. It is similar to the ootheca of \"P. virginica\", but is larger and has slightly narrower spacing of vertical divisions.\n\nTwo differently colored forms of the species were regularly collected in Kansas: a dark, olive gray to brown variety from Riley County, Kansas, and a light, golden brown to tan variety from the slopes of the Flint Hills pastures near Manhattan, Kansas.\n\nThe species was treated by one source in 1910 as a southern variety of \"Parcoblatta uhleriana\", termed \"P. uhleriana fulvescens\", as the males of the two species look very similar. Among their differences are that \"P. fulvescens\" has a pale face, longer pronotum with less distinct disc-like impressions, narrower tegmina, and different characteristics in its cerci and its anal styles (two threadlike processes on the terminal segment of the abdomen). In addition, pre-1917 Arizona records of \"uhleriana\" and \"uhleriana fuvescens\" refer to \"Parcoblatta notha\".\n\nFemale specimens of \"P. fulvescens\" can be confused with \"P. virginica\" and \"P. lata\". Females of \"P. virginica\" are on average smaller and less robust, less often have wide coloration differences, normally have a supra-anal plate with straight lateral edges that converge in a more acute apex, have a less convex caudal (rear) edge of the sixth dorsal abdominal segment, and have fewer proximal spines of the cephalic femora. Females of \"P. lata\" are much larger and more robust, with a more transverse pronotum.\n\nThe distribution of the species includes Ontario, Canada, and the eastern United States, including Alabama, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Texas. It is not clear if the species is native or adventive in Canada.\n\nThe species has been found in heavy, barrier-beach forest, in pine-barrens undergrowth (both typical or heavy and grassy), on the borders of pine barrens, on swamp edges, in heavy deciduous forest, and in heavy oak woods. In Florida it has been found in mesic hammock, xeric hammock, scrub, and sand hill habitats.\n\nIndividuals may be found under dead leaves, pine needles (particularly beneath shortleaf pine), logs, beneath loose bark, or wandering at night.\n\n"}

Brown Act, located at California Government Code 54950 \"et seq.\", is an act of the California State Legislature, authored by Assemblymember Ralph M. Brown and passed in 1953, that guarantees the public's right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.\n\nThe Brown Act, originally a 686 word statute that has grown substantially over the years, was enacted in response to mounting public concerns over informal, undisclosed meetings held by local elected officials. City councils, county boards, and other local government bodies were avoiding public scrutiny by holding secret \"workshops\" and \"study sessions.\" The Brown Act solely applies to California city and county government agencies, boards, and councils. The Act has been interpreted to apply to email communication as well, leading to restrictions on the number of parties that can be copied on electronic messages. The comparable Bagley-Keene Act mandates open meetings for State government agencies.\n\nIn late 1951, San Francisco Chronicle reporter Mike Harris spent six weeks looking into the way local agencies conducted meetings. State law had long required that business be done in public, but Harris discovered secret meetings or caucuses were common. He wrote a 10-part series on “Your Secret Government” that ran in May and June 1952.Out of the series came a decision to push for a new state open meeting law. Harris and Richard (Bud) Carpenter, legal counsel for the League of California Cities, drafted such a bill and Assembly Member Ralph M. Brown agreed to carry it. The Legislature passed the bill and Governor Earl Warren signed it into law in 1953.It should be noted, increased public notice requirements also increased local agency classified advertising spending. Public meeting notice spending was preferential for morning newspapers such as the Chronicle, which was in a bitter rivalry with William Randolph Hearst's San Francisco Examiner, an evening newspaper.\n\nThe introduction to the Brown Act describes its purpose and intent:\n\nIn enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly. The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\n\nThe \"Sacramento Bee\" said of the act:\n\nA law to prohibit secret meetings of official bodies, save under the most exceptional circumstances, should not be necessary. Public officers above all other persons should be imbued with the truth that their business is the public's business and they should be the last to tolerate any attempt to keep the people from being fully informed as to what is going on in official agencies. Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case. Instances are many in which officials have contrived, deliberately and shamefully, to operate in a vacuum of secrecy.\n\nSupporters of the Brown Act say it still lacks enforcement (and has never had a successful prosecution) contending the law has been eroded by court decisions and government officials' efforts to block access to records. \"The unfulfilled promise, I'm afraid, that 50 years has revealed, is enforcement,\" commented Terry Francke, of the California First Amendment Coalition, on the 50th anniversary of the bill's passage in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

Before long, he was involved in the local bulletin board systems and learning various other programming languages by reading books and examples.\n\nCase attended William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs, dropping out of high school at the age of 17 to focus on a career in the information technology field.\n\nIn 1999, Case gained notoriety, media coverage, and a restitution bill for defacing the web site of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center with a modified frontend for a commonly used msadc.pl exploit. Other United States government websites that were hacked include the Bureau of Land Management's national training center and the Defense Contract Audit Agency. At least 40 other websites were tampered with by Case, including Airspace USA, the bank Altamira, Nissan Motors, Honda, the monitoring station for the United States Geological Survey and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Case stated he believed he was \"on the good side\" as he broke into company websites to alert them of security problems, not to cause harm. In May 2000 Case was charged with criminal mischief and computer crime for breaking into the Colorado Springs city website, causing an estimated $25,000 in damages, though all $25,000 are costs of \"time lost\" to users.\nThese defacements launched him into the spotlight, making him a resource for the media, commenting on other hacking-related events, such as the denial of service attacks on Yahoo, eBay, Gay.com, and other well-known websites in 2000.\n\nCase performs as an MC and a DJ under the name YTCracker.

He led the LSU Tigers baseball team to five College World Series championships and seven Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships in 18 years as head coach. He amassed 870 wins, 330 losses, and three ties for a .724 winning percentage. His .754 winning percentage in NCAA baseball tournament competition is the highest among head coaches in college baseball history.\n\nBertman spent his collegiate playing days as an outfielder and catcher at the University of Miami, in Coral Gables, Florida, from 1958–1960. While a player at Miami, Bertman earned his B.A. in health and physical education. He later received his master's degree from Miami in 1964.\n\nIn 11 seasons as head baseball coach at Miami Beach High School, Bertman's team won a state championship and was state runner-up twice. Bertman was named Florida High School Coach of the Year three times. Based in part on these coaching credentials, Bertman went on to work as associate head coach at the University of Miami for eight seasons (1976–1983) under Ron Fraser. During this time, the Hurricanes won the national championship in 1982. In that 1982 College World Series, Bertman orchestrated one of the most famous plays in college baseball history—a phantom pickoff play known as the \"Grand Illusion\" which resulted in Wichita State's Phil Stephenson being thrown out at second base.\n\nBertman was hired by athletic director Bob Brodhead to coach LSU in 1984, and he transformed LSU into a baseball powerhouse, guiding the Tigers to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances, 11 College World Series appearances, seven Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships, and five NCAA baseball national championships in 18 seasons. LSU won its first two College World Series titles in 1991 and 1993, each time defeating Wichita State in the championship game. In 1996, LSU defeated Bertman's alma mater Miami for its third national title. Its fourth title came in 1997 with a 13–6 victory over Alabama in an all-SEC championship final. LSU defeated Stanford in the 2000 championship game for Bertman's fifth and final CWS title.\n\nWhile at LSU, Bertman was honored as the \"Collegiate Baseball\" Coach of the Year five times, \"Baseball America\" Coach of the Year twice, and the SEC Coach of the Year seven times, including four straight from 1990 to 1993. Bertman's teams also drew large crowds to LSU's Alex Box Stadium, as the Tigers led the nation in collegiate baseball attendance in each of his final six seasons (1996–2001).\n\nBertman served as an assistant coach for the US national baseball team which won the gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He then served as head coach of US national team in 1995 and 1996, which captured the bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics by defeating Nicaragua 10–3.\n\nBertman was named LSU's athletics director on January 19, 2001, responsible for an athletic budget of $52 million. He succeeded Joe Dean, a former Tiger basketball standout who held the position for 14 years.\n\nOn June 4, 2006, Bertman' successor as LSU's baseball coach, Raymond \"Smoke\" Laval resigned after the Tigers went 35–24 overall and 13–17 in the SEC, failing to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1988. Laval led the Tigers to the College World Series in 2003 and 2004, but tailed off in his final two seasons, losing the 2005 regional championship game at home to Rice.\n\nBertman speculated that he would consider a return to the dugout if he could not find a suitable candidate to replace Laval after the 2006 season, but the job was eventually given to Notre Dame coach Paul Mainieri. Mainieri led the Tigers to the 2009 College World Series championship, the sixth baseball national championship in school history and the first not won with Bertman as head coach.\n\nBertman presided over two football national championship seasons as athletic director. The Tigers won the 2003 BCS championship under coach Nick Saban. When Saban left at the end of the 2004 season to coach the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, Bertman moved quickly to hire Oklahoma State coach Les Miles. Miles led LSU to a consensus national championship in 2007.\n\nOther success in Bertman's tenure included five consecutive trips to the NCAA women's basketball Final Four (2004–2008) under four different coaches, an appearance in the men's basketball Final Four in 2006, a trip to the Women's College World Series in softball in 2004, and six NCAA outdoor track championships (three men's and three women's).\n\nThe LSU Board of Supervisors approved Bertman's three-year contract extension. Bertman's new extension, which was approved without discussion, called for him to be paid $425,000 annually beginning July 1, 2007, and ending June 30, 2010. Bertman, who served as Athletic Director since leaving his coaching position after the 2001 baseball season, stepped down in 2008 to become athletic director emeritus as dictated by his contract. As athletic director emeritus, Bertman's role primarily involves fundraising.\n\n\nBertman was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2002 and the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011. He was elected to the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2003, and was a member of the inaugural class of the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. In a \"Baseball America\" poll published in 1999, Bertman was voted the second greatest college baseball coach of the 20th century, behind Rod Dedeaux of USC.\n\nIn 2001, the section of South Stadium Drive between River Road and Nicholson Drive—site of the original Alex Box Stadium—was renamed Skip Bertman Drive. Bertman's No. 15 jersey was also retired by the LSU baseball team. On May 17, 2013, during a pre-game ceremony that also celebrated the 20th anniversary of Bertman's 1993 National Championship team, the field at Alex Box Stadium was officially dedicated \"Skip Bertman Field.\" The stadium itself was renamed to Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973841", "title": "Paris FC", "text": "Paris FC\n\nParis Football Club (), commonly referred to as Paris FC or simply PFC, is a French professional football club based in Paris. The club was founded in 1969 and competes in the Ligue 2, the second level of French football. Paris FC play their home matches at the Stade Charléty, which is located in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nParis FC was founded in 1969 and merged with Stade Saint-Germain to form Paris Saint-Germain in 1970. The current Paris FC exists as a result of the club splitting from Paris Saint-Germain in 1973. Unlike its counterpart, which has gone on to establish a solid foundation, Paris FC has struggled to establish itself, having spent the majority of its existence playing in the amateur divisions. The club's highest honour to date was winning its group in the Championnat de France amateur in 2006. Paris FC last played in Ligue 1 in the 1978–79 season.\n\nThough Paris FC have struggled domestically, the club has served as a springboard for several youth players who have gone on to have successful professional careers. Notable players who started their careers at PFC include Jean-Christophe Thouvenel, Paul Meunier, Mamadou Sakho, Tijani Belaid, Aymen Belaïd and Gabriel Obertan. Sakho and the Belaïd brothers have since became senior internationals for their respective national teams, while Thouvenel went on to win a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Manager Roger Lemerre started his managerial career with the club before leading France to titles at UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\nIn an effort to re-launch professional football in the city of Paris, Paris Football Club was founded on 1 August 1969. The objective of the club was to be playing in the first division by 1970. An attempted merger with CS Sedan Ardennes was refused so Paris went looking in the second division and, subsequently, merged with to form Paris Saint-Germain, the professional club that plays in Ligue 1. The current incarnation of Paris FC came into being in 1972 when the club split from Paris Saint-Germain after coming under pressure from the capital city's mayor, who refused to support a non-Parisian club (the club had originally been situated in nearby Saint-Germain-en-Laye). As a result, a bitter split occurred and both Paris FC and Paris Saint-Germain remained as separate football club with the main agreement being that Paris FC had the right to keep the splitting entity's first division and professional status, as well as all the professional players. Paris Saint-Germain were, on the other hand, administratively relegated to the third division and given all the former entity's amateur players.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1972–73 season, Paris were playing in the first division hosting matches at the Parc des Princes. Two seasons later, the club was relegated to the second division, which coincided with Paris Saint-Germain's rise to top-flight and the acquisition of the Parc des Princes. After four years of playing in Division 2, Paris returned to the first division for the 1978–79 season. However, the season was a difficult one and resulted in the club falling back to Division 2 after one season. Paris FC have since yet to return to the top-flight league of France.\n\nIn 1983, Paris FC, then led by the industrialist Jean-Luc Lagardère, merged with Racing Club de France. While Racing remained in the first division, the remaining entity that was PFC was administratively relegated to the fourth division. Due to having limited resources, Paris fell to the Division d'Honneur after one season and, subsequently, spent four seasons in the fifth division before returning to Division 4 in 1988. Another promotion the following season saw Paris earn a place in Division 3. Paris remained in the division for 12 years becoming inaugural members of the Championnat National in the process. In 2000, the club finished 17th and were relegated to the Championnat de France amateur. Paris spent six years in the league before returning to National for the 2006–07 season. After a successful 2014–15 campaign, the club gained promotion to Ligue 2, the French second division, alongside its local rival Red Star F.C. However, it would stay in Ligue 2 for only one year and was relegated back to the Championnat National for the 2016–17 season.\n\nIn the 2016–17 season, Paris FC made the playoff/relegation final against US Orleans but lost over the two legged game on aggregate. Paris FC were then administratively promoted to Ligue 2 after SC Bastia were demoted to the third division for financial irregularities.. For the 2017/2018 Ligue 2 season, Paris FC finished 8th on the table but at one stage occupied the promotion places.\n\nIn the 2018–19 season, Paris finished 4th and contested the plays-offs against RC Lens, but lost the penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw.\n\n\"As of 6 February 2020.\"\n\nBelow are the notable former players who have represented Paris and its predecessors in league and international competition since the club's foundation in 1969. To appear in the section below, a player must have played in at least 80 official matches for the club.\n\n\"For a complete list of Paris players, see \"\n\n\n\nThe club used to be the biggest and most well supported in the city, with over 20,000 supporter members at the time of the club's formation.\n\nIn 1970 the club merged with Stade Saint-Germain to form Paris Saint-Germain F.C., but quickly left the merger. In the 1973 season, the first after leaving, the club still averaged an attendance of 13,202. However, after that, the two clubs' fortuned varied drastically, and as PSG's popularity rose, PFC fell into obscurity and languished in the amateur divisions. It is only when it reached the third tier its popularity started growing again, however the club currently only attracts in the region of a few hundred to very low thousands fans for each match.\n\nIn 2000s the club used to have a supporter group called \"Blue Wolves\" founded in 2008. Officially apolitical, they tended to have right-wing views. However they were disbanded in 2010 after several hooligan incidents occurred, the last of which during a match against FC Gueugnon.\n\nThey were replaced by the group \"Old Clan\", founded in 2010, and ultras group \"Ultras Lutetia\" founded in the summer of 2014. After the expulsion of PSG fans from Parc des Princes in 2010, PFC has attracted some of that support, particularly from the left-wing group \"Virage Auteuil\", but also a few from right-wing group \"Boulogne Boys\".\n\nThe fans have a friendship with fans of SR Colmar, in the past also fans of Stade Reims.\n\nThe club has rivalries with fellow neighbours US Créteil and Red Star F.C. with whom they contest the Parisian derbies. Although both clubs are officially apolitical, due to Red Star fans left-wing political tendencies and PFC's past right-wing political tendencies, the derby is particularly fierce. The derby with US Créteil is a geographical one as both club play in the southern suburbs of Paris.\n"}

Pine Manor College and Trinity Washington University joined the conference in the 2012-13 season to replace those schools.

It was produced by Mukherjee and N. C. Sippy, with music by Rahul Dev Burman. The film won several awards and was praised by critics. It was the highest grossing Hindi film of 1979 and was a super hit.\n\nThe film was remade in Tamil as \"Thillu Mullu\" (1981), in Kannada as \"Aasegobba Meesegobba\" (1990), in Malayalam as \"Simhavalan Menon\" (1995), and in Sinhala as .\n\nRamprasad Dashrathprasad Sharma (Amol Palekar), a qualified CA, is looking for a job. He and his sister Ratna (Manju Singh) have no relatives or acquaintances except Dr. Kedar (David). Dr. Kedar tells him about Bhavani Shankar's (Utpal Dutt) firm known as Urmila Traders. Ramprasad is shown to possess many qualities. He is very good in accounting, is fond of sports and music, is a very good singer and also a very good actor (which he uses to get the job at Shankar's office).\n\nShankar is a man of traditional values: He hates youth wearing modern clothes. He is a sports fan, but thinks lowly of youth knowing anything about sports. But his weirdest trait is hatred towards men without moustaches. He thinks they are characterless.\n\nRamprasad has a moustache. He takes care of other problems by wearing a kurta and feigning ignorance about sports. Bhavani hires him immediately. Ram is a hardworking guy, so Bhavani (and Ram) have no problems. However, one day Ram takes leave by pretending that his mother (who died many years ago) has taken ill and goes to watch a hockey match. Bhavani Shankar, who attends the match, sees him there.\n\nThe next day Bhavani summons Ramprasad to his office and asks him about the hockey match. Remembering the plot of a movie a friend of his is shooting, Ram convinces Bhavani Shankar that he had seen his \"moustache-less\" identical twin Lucky (alias Lakshmanprasad Dashrathprasad Sharma) at the stadium.\n\nBhavani Shankar buys his argument and feels bad about accusing him. He makes amends by hiring Lucky to teach his daughter Urmila (Bindiya Goswami) music. Ramprasad reluctantly shaves his moustache to become Lucky and starts to teach Urmila. He is helped by his actor friend Deven Verma (playing himself).\n\nUrmila (aka Urmi) is the exact opposite of her father. She takes an immediate liking to Lucky, while Ram is barely noticed by her. Bhavani notices this and gives Ram another job to tutor on the pretext of her exams. Meanwhile, Mrs. Srivastav (Dina Pathak), a socialite, is roped to play the part of Ram, \"Lakshman\" and Ratna's mother. Like Ram, she also ends up playing her own twin in front of Bhavani.\n\nRam tells Urmila the truth. Urmila tells him to tell the truth to Bhavani as well. Ram goes to Bhavani to tell the truth, but Bhavani sees Ram's moustache giving away. Bhavani exposes Ram but ends up thinking that Lucky murdered Ram and impersonated him to marry Urmila.\n\nIn a hilarious chase that follows, Bhavani ends up totaling a police jeep. The senior inspector (Om Prakash) mistakes him for a thug named Pascal D'Costa and is about to lock him up in the jail. Only when his inspector identifies Bhavani Shankar by his real identity is he freed. By now, a harried Bhavani has developed a hatred for twins as well.\n\nOn coming home, he finds that Urmila and Lucky are married. He refuses to give them blessings, until Dr. Kedar comes to the scene and explains the situation. Bhavani becomes even more furious but, on everybody's insistence, relents. The film ends with a family photo of Mrs. Srivastav, Ratna, Urmila, Ram, Dr. Kedar, Bhavani's sister Kalindi (Shubha Khote) and Bhavani (who is shown without a moustache).\n\n\n\nHrishikesh Mukherjee had first selected Rekha to enact the heroine's part, but felt that he would be wasting a talented actress in a film where the hero was the mainstay. He replaced her with Bindya Goswami. The whole film was shot in 40 working days.\n\nDavid Dhawan's 2002 film \"Chor Machaaye Shor\" had many scenes plagiarised from \"Gol Maal\". The 2012 film \"Bol Bachchan\", directed by Rohit Shetty is loosely based on \"Gol Maal\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1973850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973850", "title": "Kantara Castle", "text": "Kantara Castle\n\nKantara Castle ( ) is a castle in north Cyprus. The exact date of its construction remains unknown, the most plausible theory being the Byzantine period. It combines Byzantine and Frankish architectural elements, became derelict in 1525 and was dismantled in 1560. It gave its name to the nearby Kantara monastery.\n\nKantara is situated to the east of the Buffavento Castle with the St. Hilarion Castle standing even further to the west forming a protective axis in the Kyrenia mountain range of Northern Cyprus. As both of the other castles are visible from Buffavento, it was used to pass signals between them. The castles were built in conjunction during the Byzantine period but the date of their commission remains unknown. Among the theories put forward to explain their origin the popular are: In 965 (after the expulsion of the Arabs from the island), in 1091 by the rebel Rhapsomates, during the rule of Eumathios Philokales (1091–1094), in the late 11th century after the Cilician coast was overrun by the Seljuk Empire or in 1096 as a countermeasure for the upheaval caused by the First Crusade. The name of the castle derives from the Cypriot Maronite Arabic word \"kandak\" which means stone bridge.\n\nServing as a watchtower for pirate raids, an administrative centre and a place of incarceration the castle saw next to no fighting. In 1191, it was taken by Richard the Lionheart during his campaign against the island's ruler Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. Richard subsequently sold the island to the Knights Templar whose rule abruptly ended after a major revolt in Nicosia. Cyprus was thus resold to Guy of Lusignan, the former king of Jerusalem who became the first king of Cyprus in 1192. A period of peace ended with the death of Hugh I of Cyprus in 1218. A struggle over who should act as the kingdom's regent ensued, pitting the House of Ibelin with the local supporters of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick's arrival in Limassol in 1228 escalated the conflict into an open war. In 1229, the castle came under siege by the Ibelins, who bombarded it with trebuchets, reportedly destroying several buildings. The castle's garrison surrendered a year later when its commander Gauvain de Cheneche was killed by a crossbow bolt. Afterwards, the Lusignans continued their reign interrupted only by occasional palace coups. In 1373, Cyprus was invaded by the Republic of Genoa imprisoning the local nobility. According to Philip of Novara's chronicle prince John of Antioch managed to escape from Famagusta after disguising himself as the valet of his cook. John subsequently fled to Kantara, from which he organised a successful counter offensive that expelled the Genoese after the latter failed to capture Kantara.\n\nRecognizing the importance of the three Kyrenian castles James I of Cyprus and Peter II of Cyprus vastly expanded their fortifications. During their reign Kantara was transformed into a garrison castle, barracks and an enormous cistern were erected. Another cistern located at the basement of the castle was converted into a prison and later made into rooms for the captain of garrison. In 1489, the Republic of Venice acquired the island, 1519 Italian engineers branded the castle as obsolete. At which time the Kyrenian mountain castles fell into disuse, the last garrison departing in 1525. The castle was finally dismantled in 1560. Kantara's buildings remain in a relatively good condition until they were subjected to looting in the early 20th century. In 1905, the castle was classified as historic heritage due to the efforts of the French archaeologist Camille Enlart. In 1914, British colonial authorities under George Jeffery undertook restoration work at the castle, in an effort to attract sightseers. In 1939, the foundation of the horseshoe tower was refurbished in order to prevent it from collapsing.\n\nKantara is situated on an altitude of above sea level. The castle is surrounded by ridges of barren granite and sandstone bedrock which were used as the main building materials for the castle's construction. The materials were subjected to coarse masonry; most of the buildings are coated with thick layers of plaster to cover the poor quality of the materials. Doors, windows and quoins were transported from elsewhere. The lack of local water sources necessitated the collection of rainwater through the use flat roofs which were connected to the cisterns through a drainage system. Among the six cisterns used the largest stood outside the walls. Buildings contained bread ovens and perhaps even a mill.\n\nThe steep crags limit the available pathways to a narrow valley on its eastern side, which is guarded by twin towers named Nicolas and Faucherre respectively. The first gate is followed by a barrel vaulted barbican, a steep chicane then leads to the portcullis protected main gate. The barbican shows great similarities with contemporary Cilician Armenian designs, having a gallery of arrowslits and two towers of its own. To the north of the main gate stands a horseshoe shaped tower providing additional support to the defenders of the barbican. The apsidal vault at the front of the tower facilitates better shock absorption. Despite its similarities to Roman and Byzantine military architecture it was in fact constructed sometime between 1208 and 1228.\n\nThe surrounding wall contained ten garrison rooms which were constructed in the late 14th century, the barracks were connected with a latrine. A concealed postern, guarded by two towers lies on the south–western corner of the castle. To the south of the main gate, was built a rectangular, barrel vaulted keep, used a prison, later converted into a cistern. The centre of its northern wall is graced by a refined late 14th century Frankish window built from what once was an embrasure. The shape of the embrasures throughout the castle points out that they were mainly used by crossbowmen. At the top of the castle stand the ruins of \"The Queen's Chamber\", an alleged fortified chapel destroyed in a Turkish naval bombardment in 1525 and looted in the 19th century.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973851", "title": "Multi-stage flash distillation", "text": "Multi-stage flash distillation\n\nMulti-stage flash distillation (MSF) is a water desalination process that distills sea water by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple stages of what are essentially countercurrent heat exchangers. Multi-stage flash distillation plants produce about 26% of all desalinated water in the world, but today virtually all new desalination plants use reverse osmosis due to much lower energy consumption.\n\nThe plant has a series of spaces called stages, each containing a heat exchanger and a condensate collector. The sequence has a cold end and a hot end while intermediate stages have intermediate temperatures. The stages have different pressures corresponding to the boiling points of water at the stage temperatures. After the hot end there is a container called the brine heater.\n\nWhen the plant is operating in steady state, feed water at the cold inlet temperature flows, or is pumped, through the heat exchangers in the stages and warms up. When it reaches the brine heater it already has nearly the maximum temperature. In the heater, an amount of additional heat is added. After the heater, the water flows through valves back into the stages that have ever lower pressure and temperature. As it flows back through the stages the water is now called brine, to distinguish it from the inlet water. In each stage, as the brine enters, its temperature is above the boiling point at the pressure of the stage, and a small fraction of the brine water boils (\"flashes\") to steam thereby reducing the temperature until an equilibrium is reached. The resulting steam is a little hotter than the feed water in the heat exchanger. The steam cools and condenses against the heat exchanger tubes, thereby heating the feed water as described earlier.\n\nThe total evaporation in all the stages is up to approximately 85% of the water flowing through the system, depending on the range of temperatures used. With increasing temperature there are growing difficulties of scale formation and corrosion. 110-120 °C appears to be a maximum, although scale avoidance may require temperatures below 70 °C.\n\nThe feed water carries away the latent heat of the condensed steam, maintaining the low temperature of the stage. The pressure in the chamber remains constant as equal amounts of steam is formed when new warm brine enters the stage and steam is removed as it condenses on the tubes of the heat exchanger. The equilibrium is stable, because if at some point more vapor forms, the pressure increases and that reduces evaporation and increases condensation.\n\nIn the final stage the brine and the condensate has a temperature near the inlet temperature. Then the brine and condensate are pumped out from the low pressure in the stage to the ambient pressure. The brine and condensate still carry a small amount of heat that is lost from the system when they are discharged. The heat that was added in the heater makes up for this loss.\n\nThe heat added in the brine heater usually comes in the form of hot steam from an industrial process co-located with the desalination plant. The steam is allowed to condense against tubes carrying the brine (similar to the stages).\n\nThe energy that makes possible the evaporation is all present in the brine as it leaves the heater. The reason for letting the evaporation happen in multiple stages rather than a single stage at the lowest pressure and temperature, is that in a single stage, the feed water would only warm to an intermediate temperature between the inlet temperature and the heater, while much of the steam would not condense and the stage would not maintain the lowest pressure and temperature.\n\nSuch plants can operate at 23–27 kWh/m (appr. 90 MJ/m) of distilled water.\n\nBecause the colder salt water entering the process counterflows with the saline waste water/distilled water, relatively little heat energy leaves in the outflow—most of the heat is picked up by the colder saline water flowing toward the heater and the energy is recycled.\n\nIn addition, MSF distillation plants, especially large ones, are often paired with power plants in a cogeneration configuration. Waste heat from the power plant is used to heat the seawater, providing cooling for the power plant at the same time. This reduces the energy needed by half to two-thirds, which drastically alters the economics of the plant, since energy is by far the largest operating cost of MSF plants. Reverse osmosis, MSF distillation's main competitor, requires more pretreatment of the seawater and more maintenance, as well as energy in the form of work (electricity, mechanical power) as opposed to cheaper low-grade waste heat.\n\nAn exhaustive analysis of the process is needed in order to study the essence of its complex nature determined by the functions and variables present in the system itself. To do this, a series of parameters must be taken into account in order to achieve a more optimized and effective process design. Among them, the following must be considered: the maximum number of flash stages, the limit of flash stages in each of the areas of the system, the function of these stages in their respective stages, the upper and lower limits of temperature of the top brine, as well as the functions of the recycled brine, cooling seawater and rejected brine.\n\nIts compression results easier buy simplifying the well-known MSF process in four different configurations in order to improve the understanding of each variable and study their influences, taking into account the previous statements. Thus, the configurations included will be explained now.\n\nTo understand the Multi-Stage Flash system (MSF)i process, the first approach that will be explained is that of Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF). This type of process is very simple and consists of a brine heater, condenser tubes and a flash pool.\n\nTo better understand the Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) layout, it is necessary to comprehend how temperatures evolve throughout the system. This temperature evolution starts with a steam that is saturated with water being used to increase the temperature of the seawater  Then, the temperature of the seawater goes from a condensed steam temperature to a temperature higher than the brine temperature. Next, the feed seawater enters the flash and causes a drop temperature in the steam which is condensed. This causes that the temperature obtained from the condensed steam is different from the previous one due to the losses produced by thermodynamics. The steam follows and condenses in around the tubes of the heat exchanger releasing the heat to the seawater introduced to the process producing that the temperature of the inlet stream to be increased to the temperature of the condensed steam.\n\nNote that the Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) has a yield lower than one, or it is the same as saying that the amount of water distilled from the product is lower than the amount of heating steam, as it can be deducted in the formula. Moreover, the Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) is that large amounts of seawater being fed and cooled in relation to the amount of product water produce major drawbacks. It may cause an energy consumption increase and the number of chemical additives that are introduced and a pre-treatment stage added could be affected.\n\nOnce the entire Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) process is explained, a series of disadvantages are obtained from this process which is why it is not used at industrial scale. One of the disadvantages is that the performance of Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) is very small, usually less than one, and that means that the amount of water we get at the end of the process is much smaller than the amount of steam we use to condense. Moreover, another disadvantage of this process is that the feed flow (seawater) is much greater than the flow of distilled water produced, which is why this process alone is not worthwhile due to the associated cost that would have to treat the distilled water. Finally, the last disadvantage that can be observed in this configuration is that the flow of cooling water that is used is very high and that would cause an increase of energy costs to pumping the water into the process.\n\nIt is necessary to highlight the fact that the heat added to the process is rejected by the cooling current which results in the flash unit not using all the energy given to it and which causes the quality to decrease and the desired result not to be obtained.\n\nThe second approach is Once-Through MSF (MSF-OT) which is a system that includes several stages and a brine heater, where these points are similar to the Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF).\n\nThe main objective of Once-Through MSF (MSF-OT) is to overcome the errors and handicaps found in Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF), which is basically to improve the performance of the system. Improving and increasing that performance is achieved by separating the flash range in more stages, thus reducing the temperature drop.\n\nAs has been done in the Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) section, the evolution of temperatures will be observed in the Once-Through MSF (MSF-OT), where it is initially observed that the temperature of the sea water that is fed increases when it passes through the tubes of the pre-heating unit that each stage has. This inlet water flows from the low temperature side to the high temperature side of the plant and the temperature of the feeding seawater increases to the brine temperature. Next, the water leaves the final condenser and enters the brine heater, where the temperature of the brine without steam is heated to a higher temperature so that this heated brine evaporates as it passes through the stages, and at the same time, the steam that evaporates condenses on the condenser tubes, with the result that the seawater that flows through the tubes is heated. To complete this process, the last part is based on collecting the distillate that flows through the stages until it reaches the final stage of the process.\n\nAn important point of this process is that it reduces the brine temperature and at the same time increases the salinity and that causes the brine to go through the last stage towards the sea. It must be noted that this configuration is distinguished from the Single-Stage Flashing unit (SSF) by the great increase in thermal performance, which increases up to six times in the one through model compared to that first approach. \n\nIn this simplification, it is proposed to recirculate the brine in order to reduce the flow of salt water in the feed, thus causing a saving in terms of pre-treatments needed in this stream. In addition, the system benefits from the difference in energy associated with the recycled brine stream with respect to the inlet seawater supply.\n\nIn this system, the recirculation is done by mixing part of the blowing brine with the feed stream, thus obtaining a mixture whose temperature and salinity are higher than in the water input stream. Note that the brine recycling system allows the maximum limit of salinity of the blow-down brine to be reached.\n\nThe outcomes obtained in the usage of this layout are several in comparison with the other configurations explained above. First, since the brine stream is recycled into the system, part of the energy is recovered enhancing the total performance. Also, as mentioned before, the part recirculated reduced the inlet seawater flow needed (e.g. low pre-treatment cost). In addition, the usage of a mixing-vessel for the feed and the recycled brine provides the user a better control of the temperature of the brine feed condenser. Moreover, since the deaeration of the feed occurs outside the stage, the corrosion rate is reduced. Finally, the reticulated brine facilitates better entrance stream temperature to the process. \n\nFinally, after evaluating all the different configurations, the real and conventional multi-stage flash system made for a 3-stage heat rejection section and a 20-stage heat recovery section is covered in this section. The system is very similar to the previous ones, where improvements have been added to each configuration until reaching this final configuration.\n\nThis final configuration, which is called conventional multistage flash system, has a series of characteristics such that the input power is reduced compared to the Once-Through MSF (MSF-OT) model, that the specific heat exchange area is less and the performance is greater. Also, the salinity for the recycling of brine is lower, and finally, the temperature of the rejected brine is lower.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973853", "title": "Sieges of Galway", "text": "Sieges of Galway\n\nThe city of Galway, Ireland - built as a naval base and military fort by Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair in 1124, refounded as a military outpost and town by Richard Mor de Burgh in 1230 - has been subjected to a number of battles, sacks and sieges. This article enumerates them.\n\nDun Beal Gallimhe can be translated as \"\"fort at the mouth of the Gallimhe river.\"\" It is believed to have been situated on the site of the present Customs House. This building is situated in the heart of the old medieval city between Quay Street to the north, Flood Street to the south, Druid Lane to the east and Quay Lane to the west. Subsequent to the founding of Galway in 1232, a castle and hall were built upon the site. The latter building was known as the Red Earl's hall and was excavated in 1999.\n\nThere is some slight evidence for Viking use of the area, at least as a seasonal camp, as the Danes of Limerick made a number of devastating raids in the area in the 9th and 10th centuries, and though the annalistic evidence is ambiguous, seem to have made some sort of semi-permanent camp along the river or in Lough Corrib. Be that as it may, the earliest known building was erected there in 1124 at the instigation of High King Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair.\n\nBoth as a naval base and military base Dun Beal Gallimhe offered several advantages. It was surrounded to the north by a number of small islands that, separated from the Dun by large streams and extremely boggy ground, made physical progress difficult and an attack futile. To the south it was bounded by muddy estuary flats and the effects of the tide which made approach from this side just as difficult. The Dun itself was raised at the very end of a thin peninsula of land that could withstand attack by a relatively small number of defenders. Due west was the river, which is one of the fastest-flowing in Europe, and yet almost the only ford on the river. If all was lost, defenders could withdraw to the west bank and flee into Iar Connacht. If, however, the attacking force could still not make the east bank, there were only two other routes to the other side, neither favourable: one was to risk a crossing of Lough Corrib, which however can be treacherous at the best of times to an unskilled sailor; second, the unenviable sixty mile slog north to Cong.\n\nFrom a naval point of view Gallimhe did not make an especially desirable port, lacking a deep harbour. Up to the early 19th century smaller ships docked at the river quay, while larger ones remained at anchor out in the bay for unloading. Yet in the early days of its existence it offered a way into Lough Corrib and its surrounding landmass, from which an invader could strike deep into the heart of Delbhna Tir Dha Locha or Maigh Seola. Conversely it also offered a route out of the latter kingdom and a means to attack its ruler's enemies. Indeed, it was used in this capacity both in the 1160s and 1590s.\n\nAt least some of these factors played a part in subsequent sieges of the settlement. Only much later in its history it would be put to use as the premier merchant port and market of Ireland's west coast. By then it had far outgrown its initial \"raison d'être\" as seen by O Conchobair and de Burgh and become \"\"the City of the Tribes\"\" (see Tribes of Galway).\n\nNaval-based warfare became something of a regular occurrence in early 12th century Ireland. The Annals of Inisfallen note raids of this nature occurring in 1100, 1101, 1119, and 1124. Perhaps this was what led to Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair to build Dún Béal Gallimhe in 1124. It was located in Clan Fergal, the territory of the O Hallorans but was supervised by Ua Conchobair's vassals, the Ua Flaithbheartaigh, who at this time were still based in their homeland of Maigh Seola.\n\nDuring the summer of 1132, Conchobhair O Brian of Thomond (modern north Munster) invaded Hy-Many where he \"\"plundered ... Maenmhagh ... [and] carried off many cows.\"\" This raid was purely of a plundering nature, yet apparently within a very short period of time, he followed it up with a full-scale assault on O Conchobair's new naval base at Dún Béal Gallimhe. The Annals of the Four Masters noted that \"\"The castle of Bun-Gaillmhe was burned and demolished [by] a fleet of the men of Munster.\"\" The Munstermen then followed this up with a devastating raid on both Clan Fergal and Magh Seola, for the same annals note that \"\"A great slaughter was made of the Connachtmen by the men of Munster, wherein Conchobhar Ua Flaithbheartaigh, lord of West Connacht\"\" was slain.\n\nAlso among the dead were \"\"the two sons of Cathal Ua Mughroin\"\" and \"Ua Taidhg \"an Teaghlaigh\"\". This is significant because the Ua Mughroin were a sept native to Hy-Many, some distance from Gallimhe which was in any case historically based in a different territory, Clann Fergal. Therefore, they must have travelled some distance to be present to fight against the forces from Munster, possibly in a levy raised by Tairrdelbach himself. Ua Taidgh's nickname, An Teaghlaigh, indicates that he was of the household, or indeed the household bodyguard, of Tairrdelbach, who would of necessity have only accompanied the High King. Therefore, the deaths of members of these three vassal clans, as well as his own possible presence at the battle, indicates the importance the High King attached to his \"\"dún\"\" on the Gallimhe. This is underlined by the fact that it was rebuilt, which can be inferred by a further attack in 1149.\n\nThe 1149 siege of Dún Béal Gallimhe was led by Toirdhealbhach O Brían, then King of Thomond. It was a combined raid of plunder (taking the rich pickings of Maigh Seola) and military strategy (destroying the Dún).\n\nIn the years immediately prior to 1149, the respective interests of Connacht - still ruled by High King Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair - and of Thomond had were confined to putting down rebellions and civil strife in their kingdoms, as well as maintaining their areas of interest. Ruaidri was frequently at odds with the O Neills in Ulster and Meath, and had a sometime antagonistic relationship with Tighernan O Rúairc, King of Brefine, which was a buffer state carved out of disputed territory between Connacht and Ulster.\n\nToirdhealbhach O Brían on the other hand was pre-occupied with extending his influence into Leinster (the kingdom whose rejection of tributes had led to his ancestor, Brian Boru's, death in 1014), as well as with putting down rebellion in his native Thomond and with ensuring his vassals of Munster, the MacCarthys, knew their place. Both Kings had in fact ratified a treaty at Terryglass Monastery in 1144, possibly to recognise and respect their spheres of influence.\n\nHowever the following year Toirdhealbhach was decisively defeated by O Conchobair and his vassals at Feara Ceall in the Sliabh Bloom; O Brian had been en route to Meath to fight O Ruairc but had been intercepted by O Conchobair. O Brian was forced to return home, \"\"without prey, without hostage, without peace, without truce.\"\" This brought O Brian and O Conchobhair into open war; O Brian struck within the same year with \"an army into Connacht; and they carried off Ua Ceallaigh, i.e. Tadhg, son of Conchobhar, lord of Ui-Maine, and slew Ruaidhri Ua Flaithbheartaigh\". The death of Ua Flaithbheartaigh indicates that an attempt may have been made on Gallimhe, but O Brian would have to wait a full four years before he reached this objective.\n\nAccording to the Four Masters, in 1149 \"\"An army was led by Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain and the men of Munster into Connacht, until they arrived at Magh Ua mBriuin; they carried off a great spoil of cattle, and demolished Dún-Gaillmhe; and Ua Lochlainn, lord of Corca-Modhruadh, was drowned in the (river) Gaillimh.\"\" Again, the mention of Magh Ua mBriuin - an alternative name for Maigh Seola - demonstrates the destruction of Gallimhe and its fleet was merely one tactic employed by O Brian. Kinsmen and vassals would only stay loyal as long as a king could deliver the goods to ensure their loyalty, hence the rich plains were plundered of their goods, food and fine cattle. It also had the additional prize of weakening O Conchobair's prime vassal in the area, Ua Flaithbheartaigh.\n\nUa Lochlainn was of the Corcu Mo Druad, vassals of O Brian, and strategically located across Galway Bay. Thus it is possible that while O Brian led his army by land, Ua Lochlainn sailed across the bay and the two inflicted a sea-and-land siege of Gallimhe; this possibility is obliquely hinted at in the manner of Ua Lochlainn's death. It may even be that, contending for the lordship of Galway Bay - from which plundering raids could be made into Clan Fergal, Maigh Seola, Meadraige and Uí Fiachrach Aidhne - O Brian may have been letting Ua Lochlainn unleash himself against a prime adversary.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, in 1151, O Brian was deposed as King of Munster by his son, Muircheartach. Muircheartach was subsequently captured \"\"by treachery\"\" by \"\"Tadhg son of Diarmaid O Brian and Diarmaid Súgach O Conchobhair\"\" and delivered to his father. However, Tadhg mac Diarmaid O Brian rose against O Brian in rebellion, with the result that \"\"Toirdhealbhach son of Ruaidhrí O Conchobhair came with him to defend the kingship of Munster for him.\"\"!\n\nCathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair had owed his position as King of Connacht to King John, and the support of the latter's vassals in Ireland. In addition, he was able to obtain recognition of his son, Aedh mac Cathal Crobdearg Ua Conchobair as his heir.\n\nIn the year after Cathal's death in 1224, Aedh had to face a rebellion by Donn Oge Mageraghty of Sil Muirdeag, Aedh Ua Flaithbertaigh of Maigh Seola and an invasion by O Neill of Tir Eoghain from Ulster. O Neill and Aedh's rebellious vassals then crowned Turlough mac Ruaidri O Conchobair King of Connacht in opposition to Aedh, who was supported by only a few vassals such as MacDermott of Moylourg and O Flynn of the Cuirc remaining loyal. With the help of his Norman allies, Aedh was eventually able to suppress the rebellion, though \"\"there was not a church or territory in Connacht at that time that had not been plundered and desolated.\"\" The war was made worse by \"\"An oppressive malady raged in the province of Connacht at this time: it was a heavy burning sickness, which left the large towns desolate, without a single survivor.\"\"\n\nOne incident during the war had given Aedh cause for concern: his erstwhile allies, the Normans of Leinster and Munster, had invaded south Connacht \"\"and slew all the people that they caught, and burned their dwellings and villages.\"\" Aedh was furious at this because it was not by his command, and because the Normans \"\"were themselves excited by envy and rapacity, as soon as they had heard what good things the Lord Justice and his English followers had obtained in Connacht at that time.\"\" It was a sign of things to come.\n\nAedh mac Cathal was murdered by the Normans in 1228 and Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair was chosen by the Normans and the chiefs of Connacht to take his place. Yet in 1230 Aedh and his vassals turned on the Normans, vowing \"\"they would never own a lord who should bring them to make submission to the Galls. They made then great raids on the Galls, Aed son of Ruaidri and the men of West Connacht plundering the young son of William and Adam Duff, while Donn Oc and the sons of Magnus with the new levies of Sil Murray plundered Mac Gosdelb and Tir Maine as far as Athlone.\"\" It was in response to this that Richard Mor de Burgh led an army into Connacht \"\"and desolated a large portion of that country.\" De Burgh brought with him Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair whom he intended to make king in place of Aedh. They crossed the Shannon at Athlone and made straight for Gallimhe.\n\nThe Dún at Gallimhe was being held and defended by Aedh Ua Flaithbertaig, who still held for Aedh mac Ruaidri (Ua Flaithbertaigh had been exiled into Iar Connacht by Aedh mac Cathal for his rebellion) . Apparently de Burgh was just reaching the Dún (and a highly apprehensive Ua Flaithbertaigh) \"\"when Aed mac Ruaidri came to his help with the Connachtmen, including the sons of Muirchertach O Conchobair.\" At some point in the fighting Aedh seems to have lost, or ceded possession of, the Dún, because the Annals of Connacht states that \"\"They were on the western bank of the Galway River and the Galls on the eastern.\"\" However, this does not seem to have been a decisive factor for de Burgh; as much as a week passed with \"\"much fighting ... between them every day, and in this condition the Galls remained, obtaining neither pledge nor hostage nor submissions from the Connachtmen.\"\" Dissatisfied with the inconclusiveness of the conflict, de Burgh cut his losses and left in the direction of Cong \"\"to pursue the cattle and folk which had fled into the mountains and recesses of the countryside and the sea-islands.\"\n\nBut as subsequent events would show, the strategic position of Dún Béal Gallimhe had made an impression upon de Burgh, and he would be back.\n\nIn 1232 de Burgh returned in force and took Fedhlim O'Conor prisoner, replacing him by Hugh O'Conor. Having taken control of the castle de Burgh made a number of substantial additions to the building.\n\nWhen Hugh O'Conor died in 1233 Fedhlim O'Conor regained his freedom and retook the town and castle. He demolished the castle works of de Burgh.\n\nRichard de Burgh recovered the town again and made it into the capital of the province, dying there in 1271.\n\nDuring the Nine Years' War Hugh Ruadh O'Donnell, in league with other chieftains, attacked the county of Galway in 1596 and, after burning Athenry, marched to the town of Galway. There they asked for provisions but were refused, retaliating by setting fire to outlying houses on the edge of the town. O'Donnell's forces were then driven off by cannon fire and an armed sally by the defenders and retreated to Mayo.\n\nOn the morning of 7 August 1642, to the \"\"considerable agitation and suspense [of the] town\"\", a naval squadron of seventeen ships appeared in Galway Bay. Led by Alexander, 11th Lord Forbes (died 1671), they had come to relieve the garrison of Forthill at the request of the English Parliament, and which had authorised him, as Lieutenant-General, to waste the coasts of Ireland. Launching long boats from the ship, Forthill was resupplied with food, arms and ammunition. Forbes then sent a messenger with a letter for Mayor Walter Lynch fitz James, ordering them to \"\"confess themselves to have been rebels, and humbly submitting to beg his majesty's intercession for them to the parliament of England, and to declare they would admit such governors as the king and state should appoint, and until then put themselves under the protection of Lord Forbes.\"\"\n\nMayor Lynch and the town council utterly refused the terms, to the surprise and anger of Lord Forbes. They instead made representations to the Earl of Clanricarde - who was at the time a neutral - for protection. Clanricarde in turn communicated to Forbes that, should he make war against the town, it would be both a breach of the peace and endanger the country by bringing yet another area into the war. Furthermore, he made it clear that, should the citizens become actively hostile against Forbes, there would be nothing he could do to influence them.\n\nAccording to James Hardiman \"\" ... Forbes, stimulated by Willoughby and Ashley\"\" - captains of the besieged Forthill - \"\"and governed by the advice of Hugh Peters, whom he brought with him as his chaplain ... was entirely deaf to every remonstrance of reason or discretion.\"\" Being unable to directly assault the town itself, Forbes landed men west of the town and took possession of the Claddagh, on the west bank of the Corrib. All of the town's surrounding suburbs and villages were burned and destroyed; dozens of locals were killed, assaulted and raped. St. Mary's Church in the Claddagh was badly defaced; in its graveyard, coffins were dug up as Lord Forbes's troops searched the bodies for rings, gold chains and the like.\n\nForbes placed \"\"two pieces of ordnance\"\", or cannons, at St. Mary's and used them to bombard the city. However, they had little effect and by early September Forbes's men were becoming irritated at both their lack of progress and lack of payment. On 7 September he cut his losses and sailed for Limerick. Forthill was once more under siege and on its own, Clanricarde's political stock had plummeted as he had been unable to prevent the sacking, and any waverers among the people of Galway were now solidly on the Irish Confederate side.\n\nThe siege of Fort-Hill by the Confederates began immediately after the departure of Lord Forbes on 4 September 1642 and continued until the surrender of Captain Willoughby on 20 June 1643.\n\nThe Parliamentary siege took place from August 1651 to May 1652 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Galway was the last city held by Irish Catholic forces in Ireland and its fall signalled the end to most organised resistance to the Parliamentarian conquest of the country.\n\nThis short siege took place during the Williamite Wars. After his success at the nearby Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1692 (O.S.) the Dutch Williamite General Godert de Ginkell in command of the English forces decided to capture the town of Galway before advancing on Limerick.\n\nGalways's defences were depleted but food supplies were adequate and reinforcements had been promised. The town's Governor, Lord Dillon, and the military commander, Lieutenant-General D'Ussone, decided to hold out rather than surrender. On 20 July 1692 a column of 14,000 English infantry surrounded the town and occupied an outlying fort. Other troops cut off the route by which reinforcements would arrive. Under pressure from the townspeople the Governor surrendered and the treaty was signed the following day, under the terms of which the town would be surrendered on 26 July with free passage to anyone who wished to leave and free pardon to those who stayed.\n\nThe Governor and the garrison forces were escorted to Limerick and Sir Henry Belasyse appointed as the new Governor.\n\n"}

Childhood friends Messenger and Fredrick had been playing in various bands throughout the early 2000s (at times with Aquino), but Every Move a Picture was not officially made active until early 2004.\n\nThe quartet was ultimately completed after Portland transplant Allen Davis answered a Craigslist posting and joined up on guitar and keyboards. Soon after, the band recorded three songs at a friend's rehearsal space; their songs found early airplay on local radio and by KROQ's Rodney Bingenheimer in L.A. As their music further filtered across to the UK courtesy of BBC Radio 1. Every Move a Picture had opened shows for the likes of the Kaiser Chiefs, Louis XIV and U2\n\nAlso generating notable buzz at 2005's SXSW—all from those first three songs—the band next released the five-song EP Blink and You'll Miss It. This led to their first live radio session at KCRW, and the licensing of various tracks to video games (\"Signs of Life\" appeared on Juiced and Need For Speed: Carbon) and television shows like One Tree Hill. Before any official release appeared overseas, Every Move a Picture played their first UK gigs to overwhelming response. The London-based label Something in Construction then issued a 7\" containing the songs \"Signs of Life\" and \"Chemical Burns,\" which promptly sold out the week of release.\n\nTouring continued, including a spot at the 2005 Reading and Leeds festivals, and serving as support for June dates with the Futureheads in the U.S. The band also issued a four-song EP \"Opposition Party\" with all proceeds going to the Rainforest Action Network. Every Move a Picture finally released their debut album, \"Heart = weapon\", on V2 in July 2006, and supported it the same year on the road with Electric Six.\n\nThe band is still active as of 2018, with active touring and recording involved.\n\n\n\n\n"}

During his course of study, he undertook employment at Australia's Commonwealth Serum Laboratories during vacation periods. Subsequently, he joined CSL on a full-time basis in 1939. Val Bazeley joined the Australian Army Militia in June 1939, and began full-time military service in the Australian Imperial Force on 23 May 1941.\n\nWith the discovery and subsequent large-scale production of the wonder drug penicillin, a project for the production of penicillin in Australia became a high priority defence need. Captain Bazeley was brought back from New Guinea, where he was a captain in the 2/8th Australian Armoured Regiment, to head the team given the task of producing penicillin. Dr. Bazeley visited the United States and returned to set up production at CSL. In the face of great difficulties, given wartime conditions, his personal contribution to the success of the project cannot be underestimated. He was a driving force and spent long hours at the laboratories grappling with the problems of the new venture. By Christmas of 1943, the first Australian penicillin had arrived in New Guinea to save countless lives. In the months to follow, enormous quantities of penicillin were produced in the primitive CSL plant, and Australia can boast of being the first country in the world to have had penicillin available for its civilian population, having met not only the needs of its own defence forces, but also those of the American allies in the southwest Pacific.\n\nIt was during this period that Captain Bazeley's promotion as Major occurred, and the familiar black beret of the Armoured Corps was replaced by the Major's peaked cap.\n\nWith the end of the war, Val Bazeley returned to university studies, and graduated as MB BS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) from the University of Melbourne in 1950. By then, he had received the O.B.E. (Order of the British Empire) for his work on penicillin.\n\nThe early 1950s saw Dr. Bazeley at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States working with Jonas Salk and his team towards the production of a Poliomyelitis vaccine. With the success of that project, he returned to Australia to once again find himself given the task of pioneering the production of an important new weapon against disease. Twenty-five million doses of Salk Poliomyelitis vaccine were produced at CSL in the 1950s and 1960s under Dr. Bazeley's leadership as director of the government institution. This led to widespread recognition. He was awarded a C.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) and was deservedly renowned in the general community where, for example, he was chosen as Victorian Father of the Year in 1958.\n\nIn 1961, Dr. Bazeley returned to the United States to work with Jonas Salk at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. Subsequently, he joined UC San Diego's University Hospital (now \"UCSD Medical Center\") as a full professor of medicine. At this same time, he also personally funded and maintained a private medical research facility outside Salt Lake City, Utah. University of California mandatory retirement rules forced Dr. Bazeley into private medical practice at the age of 67. He died 10 September 1991.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973868", "title": "CAM-D", "text": "CAM-D\n\nCompatible Amplitude Modulation - Digital or CAM-D is a hybrid digital radio format for AM broadcasting, proposed by broadcast engineer Leonard R. Kahn.\n\nThe system is an in-band on-channel technology that uses the sidebands of any AM radio station. Analog information is still used up to a bandpass of about 7.5kHz, with standard amplitude modulation. The missing treble information that AM normally lacks is then transmitted digitally beyond this. Audio mixing in the receiver then blends them back together.\n\nUnlike other IBOC technologies like iBiquity's HD Radio, Kahn's apparently does not provide a direct path to all-digital transmissions, nor any multichannel capability. Its advantage, however, is that it takes up far less of the sidebands, thereby causing far less interference to adjacent channels, hence the \"Compatible\" in the name. Interference has affected HD Radio on AM, along with its (like CAM-D) proprietary nature.\n\nDigital Radio Mondiale, commonly used in shortwave broadcasting, can use less, the same, or more bandwidth as AM, to provide high quality audio. Digital Radio Mondiale requires digital detection circuitry not present in conventional AM radios to decode programming.\n\nSpecial CAM-D receivers provide the benefit of better frequency response and a slow auxiliary data channel for display of station ID, programming titles, etc.\n\nReceivers that could decode CAM-D were not available to the public, and with Leonard Kahn's death, interest in CAM-D vanished and those stations using it turned it off, not seeing any financial return.\n\nKCI (Kahn Communications, Inc., the company that invented CAM-D) uses as one of its main selling points that some older transmitters are not directly upgradeable to transmit HD Radio. It is true that older transmitters may lack the transmission purity needed to support HD Radio's digital transmission standard, but more recent transmitters are more likely to be capable of upgrading to transmit HD Radio. CAM-D is said to work with a wider variety of existing transmitters, which is a selling point for smaller broadcasters with limited budgets. The price of the CAM-D hardware is $65,600 as of July 1, 2007.\n\nCAM-D is said to add high-frequency program information digitally transmitted and then overlaid onto the existing low- to mid-frequency analog program. This provides enhanced fidelity that under adequate analog signal conditions may allow AM stations to transmit music and other program content with a more lifelike sound.\n\nA significant disparity between Ibiquity's AM HD Radio and CAM-D is that of time diversity. Namely, HD Radio's AM broadcast scheme broadcasts two copies of the program offset by a few seconds, allowing signal to be briefly lost and maintain uninterrupted program audio (for example, driving under an overpass, multipath in urban areas, lightning, switching transients, etc.). . However, in the field, HD Radio, at a distance from the transmitter, is still not immune to the aspects of the AM dial such as those below.\n\nA substantial problem of analog AM transmission is that it is subject to poor signal to noise ratio due to radio frequency noise from man made and natural sources, such as fluorescent lamps, motors, switches and lightning. Simply adding high frequency information does not produce high fidelity. HD Radio signals on AM, however, use more bandwidth signal wise and often create \"hash\" on surrounding frequencies, up to 30 kHz from the center frequency. This interference, which is audible mainly on analog radios, was one of the reasons Citadel Communications pulled night broadcasts of their AM HD station's signals. CAM-D does not produce interference on any channels 10 kHz or more from the center frequency.\n\nCAM-D is a system that is applicable to medium wave and possibly shortwave transmission. Since receivers are designed for multiple bands, a receiver that requires a substantially different architecture for CAM-D will require special circuitry that will increase its cost. This is similar to HD Radio and other digital radio services. Since they all require new circuitry, inevitably, the price of manufacture will increase. This price will likely begin to decrease once the technology becomes proven. Since all new broadcast radios are moving to full digital formats that decode with nearly identical hardware (XM, Sirius, HD Radio (in digital mode), Digital Audio Broadcasting, Digital Radio Mondiale) in the long term, the overhead of analog circuitry will cause a cost penalty to implement the technology in future radios.\n\n"}

The group consists of Sonangol E.P. () and its many subsidiaries. The subsidiaries generally have Sonangol E.P. as a primary client, along with other corporate, commercial and individual clients. Angola is estimated to have over of offshore and coastal petroleum reserves, and new discoveries are outpacing consumption by a 5 to 1 ratio.\n\nOn the eve of Portuguese Angola's independence from Portugal following the Carnation Revolution and the election of a democratic government in Portugal in 1976, the company ANGOL (ANGOL \"Sociedade de Lubrificantes e Combustíveis\" Sarl), founded in 1953 as a subsidiary of Portuguese company SACOR) was nationalized and split in two, forming Sonangol U.E.E. and Direcção Nacional de Petróleos. Directive 52/76 instituted Sonangol as a state-owned company with a mandate to manage the country's substantial petroleum and natural gas. Using the extant remains of Texaco, Total, Shell and Mobil's oil works, Sonangol obtained the assistance of Algerian Sonatrach and of Italian Eni.\n\nOil giant Marathon Oil announced in September 2013 that it had agreed a deal in principle to sell a 10% stake in its offshore Angolan oilfield to Sonangol.\n\nIn December 2013, Sonangol acquired the exploration rights to five onshore oil blocks in Angola, which could be tendered for development at a later date.\n\nIn June 2016, president José Eduardo dos Santos removed the entire board of Sonangol, and installed Isabel dos Santos as chairwoman of the company, to \"ensure transparency and apply global corporate-governance standards\". This led to many accusations of corruption and nepotism. However, in November 15, 2017, the new president of Angola João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço dismissed Isabel dos Santos and named Carlos Saturnino Guerra Sousa e Oliveira as the Sonangol chairman. \nAn internal audit later revealed that after she had been dismissed, dos Santos transferred US$38 million of the company's funds to a suspicious Dubai based company.\n\nIn December 2011, Human Rights Watch said that the Government of Angola should explain the whereabouts of US$32 billion missing from government funds linked to Sonangol. A December 2011 report by the International Monetary Fund said that the government funds were spent or transferred from 2007 through 2010 without being properly documented in the budget. The IMF was assured that most of $32 billion was being used for legitimate government reasons and considered to be \"found\".\n\nToday (as of 2006), Sonangol has over 30 subsidiaries and maintains overseas facilities in the following cities:\n\nAs the company grew it had a need to obtain services, such as telecommunications services, retail network support, trucking, shipping, data management, scientific, engineering, seismic, and others. The company created subsidiaries to meet these needs. Sonangol and its many subsidiaries have continued to expand into other lines of business. Among the more important subsidiaries are Sonair and MSTelcom.\n\nSonangol is one of the major shareholders of the Portuguese energy company Galp Energia through its indirect participation in the capital of Amorim Energia, which holds one third of GALP's shares and on which board sits the son-in-law of the Angolan President.\n\nSonangol is an important sponsor of the arts, sports and humanities in Angola and in Africa. On December 12, Reuters reported that Sonangol won the rights to develop the Iraq's Najmah oilfield in a bid held that day. The company's plateau production target for the field in the volatile province of Nineveh is (bpd), and the remuneration fee is $6 per barrel. Sonangol had proposed a per-barrel fee of $8.50, but then accepted the Oil Ministry's lower amount.\n\nIn 2018, Sonangol announced that they will reactivate their Iraqi oil exploration fields in Najma and Qayara after years of closure due to constant armed conflicts. The two oil fields in Iraq are estimated to still have a reserve of 1 billion barrels of oil. \n\nSonangol USA, Sonangol London, and Sonangol Asia are the main trading and operations offices for the crude and product cargoes sold on behalf of Sonangol E.P.

Backed by the Hi-Rollers, he became one of the top dance-hall acts of his musical decade. He wrote, recorded and performed many songs in both Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole languages, as well as in English, primarily on the Rounder Records label.\n\nBeau Jocque was born Andrus Espre in Duralde, Louisiana to Sandrus and Vernice (née Allen) Espre. His father (nicknamed \"Tee Toe\") was a well-respected accordion player who performed at many local dances, but who quit playing music when Andrus' older brother was born. Andrus played guitar in a high school band but his influences were not zydeco musicians but rather acts such as War, ZZ Top, Stevie Ray Vaughan, James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, and Santana.\n\nHe enlisted in the Air Force after high school, and eventually made it to the rank of sergeant, had a top security clearance and was stationed in London and Germany. He once escorted Henry Kissinger around Europe. Espre had his first near-death experience while in the Air Force, when an explosion left him in the hospital with amnesia. He spent nine years in the military, then came home to work as an electrician and welder. He was a long time resident of Kinder, Louisiana. He was also known to write poetry, and preach about respecting nature.\n\nWorking in an oil refinery after leaving the Air Force, Espre experienced a work-related accident on September 4, 1987, which left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. During his recuperation, as part of his therapy he began playing his father's button accordion. After a year of practice and gaining proficiency on the accordion, Espre and his wife Michelle began to study the styles of the successful groups on the zydeco circuit. \"We checked out C. J. Chenier, Buckwheat Zydeco, Boozoo Chavis, John Delafose and I'd watch the crowd. When they got real excited, I'd try to feel what was happening at that point. Was it the rhythm guitar? The drums? The accordion style? I realized that when you get the whole thing just right, it's going to move the crowd.\"\n\nEspre grew up speaking Louisiana Creole French and spoke it fluently. As he was physically a large man at tall and , he took the stage name \"Beau Jocque,\" which was a childhood nickname in Louisiana Creole meaning \"Big Guy.\" In 1991, he put a band together, including his wife Shelly on rubboard. They initially talked themselves into a few gigs in small clubs or for trail ride parties, and word spread quickly about a new zydeco artist. He especially appealed to a younger crowd by incorporating rock guitar solos, blues-rock beats, and rap lines into his songs, along with his bass vocals and growling lyrics. His initial recording got airplay on local radio stations and the larger zydeco clubs began to take notice. Within a short amount of time, Beau Jocque was playing clubs four to five nights a week and just a few years after his accident, Espre was one of the biggest draws on the Louisiana zydeco circuit. In June 1995 one newspaper stated that \"There has simply never been a zydeco phenomenon like Beau Jocque and the Hi-Rollers\" who have \"thoroughly modernized zydeco\". His major zydeco influence was Boozoo Chavis who also played the button accordion, with hypnotic riffs and two-step stomps that were favorites with south Louisiana dancers.\n\nIn 1995 Beau Jocque and the Zydeco Hi-Rollers were the headliners on the Rounder Records \"Louisiana Red Hot Music Tour\". In June 1999 they were a featured band at the first annual New Jersey Arts and Music Festival.\n\nBeau Jocque and the Zydeco Hi-Rollers won the Big Easy Music Awards three times as Best Zydeco Artist.\n\nBeau Jocque's first recording was a 1992 vanity release titled \"My Name is Beau Jocque\" (Lanor Records 1031), which was re-issued in 1994 by Paula Records. Espre sent cassettes of this release to area radio stations and also sold them at his gigs. He had to re-order more copies because they sold very quickly.\n\nScott Billington, a producer for Rounder Records who was familiar with the Louisiana zydeco scene, picked up on the buzz surrounding Beau Jocque and signed him to his label. \"Beau Jocque Boogie\" was released in 1993, and it contained the song that became his first hit and signature song, \"Give Him Cornbread\". The song, written by Espre, includes elements of Willis Prudhomme's zydeco arrangement of \"Shortnin' Bread\" and FM's hip hop song \"Gimme What You Got (For a Porkchop)\". Audiences demanded that the band play that song multiple times at dances, and as the song gained popularity, fans would throw pieces of cornbread onto the stage. \"Beau Jocque Boogie\" became the highest-selling zydeco album ever.\n\nBeau Jocque recorded five studio albums for Rounder, with a sixth live album titled \"Give Him Cornbread, Live\" released on the label posthumously in 2000. The label also issued two posthumous compilation albums. All were financial successes for both the label and the artist. His contract with Rounder was not exclusive, so Beau Jocque also recorded two albums for New Orleans-based Mardi Gras Records as well as a mini-CD on his own label.\n\nBeau Jocque's rapid rise to the top of the zydeco circuit created some tension with the older musicians, who felt he hadn't paid his dues. Zydeco pioneer Boozoo Chavis even recorded a song called \"Boozoo's Payback\" that included the lyrics \"He plays my music and he does me wrong, but he can't sing my song\", directed at Beau Jocque.\n\nBut the rivalry was also good for business. The Mid-City Lanes Rock n' Bowl in New Orleans staged annual mock battles billed as \"Boo vs. Beau\" during the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, which each year drew more than 1,000 patrons and set attendance records at the venue. One year, Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones paid the $5 admission charge to experience the showdown. One such \"battle of the bands\" was the centerpiece of a 1994 documentary film \"The Kingdom of Zydeco\" by director Robert Mugge.\n\nIt was a friendly rivalry. The two musicians often traded insults in public but they were supportive of each other in private. Beau Jocque often played Chavis' songs during his performances, and even performed at a benefit concert to raise money to pay the costs of surgery for Chavis' wife. In the 1994 film, both musicians admitted that the battle of the bands was a promotional gimmick.\n\nThe final \"Boo vs. Beau\" battle in New Orleans was held on May 2, 1999 at the Rock n' Bowl.\n\nEspre and his wife Michelle (\"Shelly\") had two sons, Andrus Adrian and Justin Travis.\n\nIn 1995, Espre suffered a heart attack in Austin, Texas while touring with Marcia Ball and Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys. Radio stations in Louisiana had reported the 1995 heart attack was fatal, and he surprised his fans (including the town's mayor) by shortly thereafter appearing in the local supermarket in Kinder.\n\nOn September 9, 1999, Beau Jocque and the Zydeco Hi-Rollers performed a two-set show at the Rock n' Bowl in New Orleans, and afterwards drove the approximately 200 miles on Interstate 10 back to Kinder. The next morning, Beau Jocque was found collapsed in the shower by his wife, dead of an apparent heart attack at the height of his career. He is buried in Saint Matilda Cemetery, Eunice, Louisiana.\n\nEspre's death was preceded only two weeks earlier by the death of his father, Sandrus.\n\nMembers of the Hi-Rollers include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1973906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973906", "title": "Goemon's Great Adventure", "text": "Goemon's Great Adventure\n\nThe quirky story highlights Goemon's quest to stop the evil Bismaru, who has stolen Wise Man's resurrection machine. Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" continues the series' tradition of offbeat, surreal humor.\n\nThe game was received well, with more than 160,000 copies sold worldwide. Reminiscent of older, 16-bit games, the side-scrolling system was lauded by reviewers, who also praised the two-player cooperative mode. The game's vibrant graphics and musical score earned high marks as well. Reviewers have considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64.\n\n\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" is a side scrolling platform game in which players navigate stages. Gameplay in \"Great Adventure\" more closely resembles that of the \"Ganbare Goemon\" series' Super Famicom entries, and abandons the free-roaming style of \"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\". Although movement is restricted along a two-dimensional plane, the stages are rendered in three dimensions and frequently wind along the z coordinate—earning the game a 2.5D status similar to \"Yoshi's Story\", \"\", and the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series. The game begins on a world map upon which several circles are placed indicating stages. Players must complete certain stages to open up paths to others, and each world map generally features one town and one dungeon. Completing a dungeon allows travel to a new world map, but the player must collect several entry passes to gain access to these structures. Passes are rewarded for completing stages and performing tasks for non-player characters in cities. Though the game is linear like its 16-bit predecessors, certain non-linear elements exist—such as a secret village and multiple paths through a world map.\n\n\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" takes place in a fantastical version of Edo period Japan, featuring forests, mountains, dwellings, and underworlds designed with Japanese themes and a touch of science fiction. Individual stages are populated by monsters, obstacles, items (such as Ryō currency or dumplings), and occasionally bosses, who are stronger than most enemies. Players can run, jump, attack with weapons, and use various special abilities to reach the end of levels and gain entry passes. Four characters with three uniforms are available for play, including Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, and Yae. Characters can be changed in cities or in stages through portals to an interdimensional teahouse. Two players can play the game simultaneously, though they must both be visible on screen—one player cannot advance if the other runs in a different direction. In each stage, a bar at the bottom of the screen displays information concerning character health, weapon equipped, lives remaining, and time of day. If a character is touched or attacked by a monster, a health bar is reduced from a total of three. If all bars disappear, the player loses a life and must restart the stage. The game ends if all lives are lost, at which point it reverts to the beginning or the last point at which the player saved his or her progress with a Controller pak. Defeated monsters sometimes leave behind dumplings and Maneki Neko—the former replenishes health, and the latter upgrades weapons up to two levels above starting strength.\n\n\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" features a system of day and night. Every two to three minutes, a meter in the information bar will slowly turn to evening or morning; the sky in a stage's background will similarly emulate the hues of a sunset or a sunrise. At night, more powerful and swift enemies challenge players. However, they produce two Ryō coins rather than one when killed. Different non-playable characters can be found at night in towns as well. Within these cities, players can purchase armor (represented by three blue bars), sleep in inns and eat in restaurants to recover strength, and perform miniature quests for entry passes. For example, the character Sasuke must help a man in Spook Village set off fireworks for a festival. Scripted events relating to the game's storyline also take place in dwellings, and occur elsewhere before characters assault dungeons or after these special stages have been completed. The successful infiltration of a dungeon often leads to a battle between three giant mecha robots. These conflicts pitch the player, controlling the robots Impact and Lady Impact, against a villain and his or her robot of choice. From the perspective of a cockpit behind Impact's eyes, players can punch, kick, grab, or fire nasal and beam weaponry at an enemy robot. Measures of health, enemy health, and ammunition are displayed in the cockpit. If the player's robot runs out of health, the game restarts at the beginning of the battle. To avoid this scenario, players can throw a baton to the other friendly robot; if it hits its mark, player perspective changes to the new robot who has his or her own health count. In two-player mode, one player waits while the other fights, and comes into play if the baton is passed. The penultimate conflict in the game is an Impact battle, and after winning a final fight in the normal side-scrolling mode the player can witness the ending of the game.\n\nThe protagonist of \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" is Goemon, a ninja with blue, bushy hair who wields a kiseru. Goemon can jump higher than his friends, throw money, and use a chain pipe. His friends are Ebisumaru, Yae, and Sasuke. Ebisumaru is a fat man with a blue bandana and a love of food. Idolizing James Dean as the ultimate ninja, he can attack enemies with a decorative paddle, a magic megaphone that causes his shouts to turn to stone, and stomach gas. Yae is a green-haired female ninja, or kunoichi, wielding a Katana. She has the ability to morph into a mermaid in order to swim underwater and use a bazooka. Finally, Sasuke is a fast mechanical ninja who has upgradable projectile attacks such as shuriken and bombs. The villains of \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" are Bismaru and Dochuki. Bismaru, a cross-dressing nun (who first appeared in \"\"), steals Wise Man's resurrection machine to revive Dochuki, an ancient prince of the underworld. While Bismaru fights with his giant robot, Dochuki confronts the party in person.\n\nNeutral characters include the Wise Man, Omitsu, Edo's Lord, Princess Yuki, and a young cat girl named Suzaku, who assists Goemon and his friends with information. For battles with large foes, characters pilot the giant robots Impact and Miss Impact, created by the Wise Man to resemble Goemon and Omitsu. Finally, in every town, starting at Ryo, there is a fortune teller called Plasma. He gives the player hints as to the location of every entry pass in the area.\n\nGoemon and his friends must stop Ebisumaru's descendant Bismaru, who plans to use one of the Old Wise Man's inventions in order to unleash another disaster. Specifically, the Old Wise Man (who has appeared in every game in the series) has created a \"ghost return machine\" that can bring the dead back to life. Bismaru is attempting to create an army of undead creatures for her master, Dochuki, the master of the underworld. Enemies like ghosts, skeletons, and creatures from Japanese folklore have been unleashed and must be stopped.\n\nGoemon and Ebisumaru then, will travel around five different worlds, starting from Edo. In the local town, \"Lost'n Town\", Sasuke will join them. Later they will reach the Edo Castle, where they will try to save Omitsu, the King and his daughter from the robot Impact, himself. As they realize Impact was hypnotized by Bismaru, the princess of Edo reveals that Bismaru was attempting to reach some island.\n\nEventually, Goemon and allies reach Tortoise Island and find their final partner, Yae, who provides Sasuke with a \"diving device\". The team follows Bismaru to the second castle, which contains several underwater levels. After defeating Bismaru's robot, Bismaru turns to disappear again.\n\nA new neutral character appears, a mysterious female ghost named Susaku, who tells Goemon where Bismaru escaped: Mafu Island, an island full of undead, creepy ghost creatures in middle of the lava. In the local town, Goemon meets the Wise Man again, who reveals Bismaru's plan of returning the evil king Dochuki to the human world again. The gang must head to the third castle just to realize that it's too late, and Dochuki is already alive.\n\nGoemon and his friends manage to get to the Underworld, where undead and ghost creatures reside, and destroy Wise Man's Machine in the Underworld Castle. Unable to stop Bismaru again, Susaku appears to give Goemon directions. This time, the scenario takes places in a Floating Island in the sky. Susaku also gives Goemon a container to catch Dochuki's soul.\n\nThe final castle, \"Dream Castle\", is a combination of the four previous castles, where the gang will find Susaku kidnapped by Dochuki, threatening to kill her if they don't give him the container. Goemon does so, having no option, and Dochuki breaks it with his hands.\n\nImpact and Dochuki's evil ghost-robot get into a fight. Eventually, Impact wins, and what appears to be the final encounter is a fight between Dochuki and Goemon. After being defeated, Dochuki shows his real form, a giant wolf which spits poisonous gas.\n\nDochuki is beaten and tries to escapes, as there is no container to catch him, but Ebisumaru \"farts\" and kills Dochuki's spirit, as Ebisumaru's gas mixed with the spirit.\n\nAfter the game is completed, Wise Man calls Goemon's gang to thank and tell them that he invented a new and more powerful machine to resurrect the dead, again. Suddenly, a baby appears from nowhere, and Ebisumaru claims that it's from him. Bismaru appears and tries to kidnap the new ghost return machine again, but the baby accidentally presses the machine's self-destruct button.\n\nAs in previous \"Ganbare Goemon\" games, the plot is wacky and lighthearted. Nintendo wrote that Goemon seems \"at ease roaming a medieval Japan bustling with robots, DJs, space ships and extra-hold mousse\".\n\nKonami heavily promoted the \"Ganbare Goemon\" series for the Christmas season of 1998, as three games were due to be released—\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" and the PlayStation release \"\" would premiere on December 23, 1998, and \"\" for the Game Boy Color would enter the market on January 14, 1999. \"Great Adventure\" and its PlayStation counterpart were both shown to fans at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show, where children flocked to play them. News of an English translation and North American release was first provided by a Konami employee in September 1998, and the finished game appeared at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo, though without the theme song sequence. It was originally slated to be named \"Mystical Ninja: Goemon 2\" in North America; this title was kept in some form for the PAL release, entitled \"Mystical Ninja 2: Starring Goemon\". To generate interest and incentive for the North American release, Konami included $20 rebates for \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" or \"Castlevania 64\" in copies of \"Hybrid Heaven\".\n\n\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" continues its predecessor's musical style by integrating modern synthesizers and traditional Japanese instruments. The game features two musical numbers: \"SMILE AGAIN\", a rock theme song, and \"DOUBLE IMPACT\", an updated version of \"I Am Impact\" from \"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\". Two performers from that game returned for its sequel; Ichirou Mizuki voiced \"I Am Impact\"'s music with Sakura Tange and Hironobu Kageyama sang \"Great Adventure\"s theme song. These performances were inexplicably cut from the North American and European releases of the game, leaving the title screen silent and eliminating the Impact battle preparation sequence. Japanese voice acting in the opening and ending scenes was left in. A team of five composers created the game's main soundtrack, each personally writing several demos and arranging finished pieces. The music of nearly all stages changes in response to the day and night system of gameplay. In normal stages, at night a stage's unique theme slows down and segues into a night theme particular to all levels in a world map. As morning approaches, the evening song fades as the stage's normal theme resumes. In settlements, night themes maintain the arrangement of the day theme, albeit with softer tones and instruments. Music also changes within dungeons, usually becoming faster-paced as players advance. One composer regretted that the space limitations of a compact disc would preclude the appearance of night themes on an official release, and stated that timing the musical changes for the system was a difficult process. Yet another spoke on the style of \"Ganbare Goemon\" music:\n\nA few songs from earlier titles appear, including Bismaru's theme and the ending music introduced in \"Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Dōchū: Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake\". A composer who grew up as a fan of Konami's game integrated rhythms reminiscent of beatmania's catalogue in a few songs. A 68-track soundtrack was released by Konami on January 22, 1999.\n\n\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" sold over 160,000 copies worldwide and received favorable reviews, earning an 8 out of 10 at IGN, an A at 1UP.com, a 3.5 out of 5 at GamePro, and a metascore of 80% at GameRankings. Critics enjoyed the \"simple, yet enjoyable platform gameplay\", specifically citing Castlevania overtones and fresh, varied level design as strong points. The 2.5D system received much fanfare; GamePro stated that it made the game \"more exciting than any old 2D scrollers.\" Nintendo noted that the game looks \"more realistic than any 16-bit platformer, but...plays just like one\". The presence of a cooperative mode for two players was considered a huge improvement over the game's predecessor, and brought back memories of \"classic Nintendo and Konami sidescrollers.\" David Canter of The San Diego Union-Tribune said the \"ability to control four diverse characters gives the game a nice touch of variety\". The camera issues found in \"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" were solved by the switch to the side-scrolling genre. Peer Schneider of IGN celebrated the game's non-linear puzzle elements and quests, which made the game require more than a day to complete. GamePro noted that these quests still took place in completed stages, lending little added appeal. While Nintendo Power applauded the precise play control, GamePro argued that it could have been slackened somewhat. Canter countered, \"control is responsive. A good thing, too, as \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" quickly becomes challenging... The only problem with control occurs when playing as the mermaid...maneuvering a beached whale might be easier.\" \"Great Adventure\"s graphics impressed critics. Schneider wrote that they seemed \"right out of a Kurosawa movie, complete with both Buddhist and Shinto architecture, temples, shrines, tombstones, cogs, mills, giant frogs, statues and more\". Nintendo lauded the special effects, including \"artfully composed cinema sequences...backdrops of glimmering water...and...translucent spirits\". Canter agreed that while they \"don't set a new standard, but there are some nice visual touches\". GamePro and IGN agreed that enemy design was generally less impressive, excepting the boss characters and Impact robots. David Canter disagreed, citing \"castle bosses, such as the screen-filling skeleton\" as \"especially eye-pleasing\".\n\nSeveral reviewers reiterated concerns over the previous game that the overt Japanese setting and humor might alienate North American fans. One reviewer suggested the game for fans \"capable of overlooking some of the games' more inscrutable cultural references.\" Nintendo Power wrote that \"the story is a weird mix of sci-fi, Japanese culture and superheroes, but it seems perfectly suited to the game...full of action and variety.\" Levi Buchanan, one of the magazine's reviewers, asserted that the game \"radiates personality\", while GamePro centered its opinion of the game as very quirky. IGN echoed these sentiments, stating that the plot seemed \"completely nuts...[yet] somehow fits together to make a highly entertaining and original game.\" The soundtrack—\"always a Konami hallmark\"—was received well, with critics identifying \"that peculiar mix of synthesizer music and old-fashioned shamisen, koto and drum music\". Nintendo specifically praised \"subtle transitions from day to night and back again.\" Schneider also singled out the Underworld dungeon's theme for praise, remarking that it suited the \"Castlevania\" style of the stage well. The sound effects of the game mirrored ones used in 16-bit \"Ganbare Goemon\" games, although increased in sampling rate and variety.\n\nIGN's Schneider remarked that \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" would have benefitted from more role-playing game elements as exemplified in \"\". He also regretted that the miniature games (\"Gradius\", among others) found in earlier games were absent. Jason Leung of Nintendo Power wrote, \"finally, a sidescroller done right for the N64\". David Canter concluded,\n\nIGN summarized, \"two-player co-op, 2D gameplay with 3D graphics, and excellent music make this a much better game than the first N64 Mystical Ninja installment.\" GamePro's conclusion was less favorable, stating that \"\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" is a bit of a let down...a good attempt at an old-school 2D platformer, but...falls short in many ways.\" Nintendo's online review concluded that \"\"Great Adventure\" is an excellent example of how fun good ol' platformers can be.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Goemon's Great Adventure\" emerges as a much better game than its predecessor - and, like the \"Crash Bandicoot\" series, shows that not every game needs to be in full 3D to be fun.\"\n\nAs of 2012, \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" is the last \"Ganbare Goemon\" game to date that has been translated to English and released overseas. The next and final \"Goemon\" game for the Nintendo 64 is \"Goemon Mononoke Sugoroku\", released exclusively in Japan on December 25, 1999. In \"Mononoke Sugoroku\", players must collect Ofuda cards while navigating a board game. Konami followed with \"Bouken Jidai Katsugeki Goemon\", a game for the PlayStation 2 released on December 21, 2000, and other PlayStation games in 2001. The now-defunct company Working Designs attempted to bring \"Bouken Jidai Katsugeki\" to English audiences as \"Mystical Ninja Goemon\" beginning in May, 2002. Motivated to promote a series \"that's never quite received the recognition it deserves here [in the United States]\", Working Designs demonstrated the game in its booth at E3 a month later. \"Mystical Ninja Goemon\" remained on the studio's release list until its closing in 2005; it is rumored that Sony canceled the game's release due to subpar graphics. While Goemon ceased to appear on home consoles in 2001, Konami continued to release handheld games, and experimented with the series formula by revising Goemon's appearance, using futuristic settings, and employing a more serious tone. The medieval, quirky, Japanese themes were revived on June 23, 2005 with \"\" for the Nintendo DS.\n\n"}

A member of the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party, he served as party leader from 2001 to 2013. He became Premier in 2009 after his party defeated the governing Progressive Conservative Party, leading the first NDP government in Atlantic Canada and the second east of Manitoba. His government was defeated in the 2013 election, becoming the first Nova Scotia government in 131 years to be denied a second mandate; Dexter himself was defeated in his constituency by 21 votes. Dexter now serves as a lobbyist for the cannabis industry.\n\nDarrell Dexter was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia to Elvin, a steel metal worker, and Florence Dexter (née Pace), and grew up in the rural community of Milton in Queens County. He was the first member of his family to go to university.\n\nDexter volunteered for Alexa McDonough in her 1979 federal election campaign. Dexter holds degrees in education and law from Dalhousie University, and a degree in journalism from the University of King's College. He used his journalism degree for a period as a reporter for \"The Daily News\" in the early 1980s. Dexter also served in the Canadian Forces holding the rank of Sub-Lieutenant and was a Combat Information Officer on board and while deployed with Maritime Forces Pacific.\n\nDexter was a practicing lawyer before he entered public life. He was first elected as a Dartmouth City Councilor, serving from 1994 to 1996.\n\nA former Chair and member Board of the Dartmouth Downtown Development Corporation, Dexter was also once a member of the Dartmouth General Hospital Commission, Chair of the Dartmouth Common Committee, a former member of the Board of Directors of the Victorian Order of Nurses (Dartmouth Branch), and a member of the Community Planning Association.\n\nIn September 2015, Dexter joined Global Public Affairs as Vice Chair.\n\nDexter is married to Kelly Wilson and together they have one son.\n\nDexter was elected to the Nova Scotia Legislature as MLA for Dartmouth-Cole Harbour in 1998 and served as critic for Economic Development and Health. He was re-elected in 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2009.\n\nDexter became the 8th leader of the Nova Scotia NDP in June 2001 when he took over as interim leader after Helen MacDonald stepped down. He ran for the leadership against John MacDonell in 2002 and won with 63% of the vote.\n\nIn Dexter's first provincial campaign in 2003, the NDP campaign trailed in third place in many polls and was in danger of losing seats. The NDP looked to consolidate its strong support in the Metro Halifax area, and make gains in the conservative rural mainland and Cape Breton.\n\nDexter campaigned to form Crown Corporation for car insurance to lower premiums by 50%, paying for health coverage in nursing homes, reducing waiting lists for surgeries and diagnostic tests, removing the provincial portion of the HST on home heating oil, increase classroom resources for public schools, freezing tuition fees for Nova Scotia universities for a year while introducing a student debt relief plan, and maintaining balanced budgets.\n\nOn election night, Dexter and the NDP did make small gains in the popular vote and won four more seats, including two in Dartmouth, one in Cape Breton and one in Pictou County, and the Progressive Conservative government of John Hamm was reduced to a minority administration.\n\nThe MacDonald Government called an election for June 13, 2006, and Dexter was once again the NDP's candidate for Premier. At the outset, most pollsters had the NDP at the same level of support it had in 2003, roughly 30% and behind the Tories in second place. Dexter campaigned on a platform to improve services for seniors, lowering the cost of heating oil for homes, a 10% cut in post-secondary education tuition, subsidized child care and public auto insurance.\n\nDexter performance in the leaders' debate was improved in the eyes of many pundits. The NDP did not win government, but did make major gains on election day. The party gained five seats for a total of 20, the party's best performance in its history. Dexter also was easily re-elected in his own seat of Cole Harbour with 59.5%. The NDP gained roughly 4% of the popular vote to 34.5%. The NDP also won seats in the South Shore region of Nova Scotia, an area where it had not performed well previously, specifically Shelburne and Queens.\n\nDexter was Opposition Leader to both Conservative Premier John Hamm and Rodney MacDonald. He credited his ability to work with Hamm to get things done as the reason for the NDP increase in seats in the 2006 election.\n\nWithin a few months of the 2006 election, the NDP took a lead in the opinion polls, and held it consistently until the 2009 election.\n\nThe NDP and Liberals voted against a money bill on May 4, 2009; forcing an election one year before it was due. By this time, the NDP had been leading in opinion polls for most of the last three years and was on target to win a minority government. The NDP looked to hold its support in the Metro Halifax area, and make gains on the South Shore and rural mainland Nova Scotia.\n\nDexter campaigned on a document called Better Deal 2009 which came with 50 promises to be completed over 4 years, and focused on 7 key commitments of creating new jobs, helping to keep emergency rooms open, taking the HST off of home electricity, fixing rural roads, helping seniors, giving young people a reason to stay in the province, and more renewable energy.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, Dexter was elected the first NDP premier of Nova Scotia with a majority of the seats in the Nova Scotia legislature. They held their support in Halifax and Cape Breton, and expanded their base on the South Shore, Pictou and suburban Halifax. The NDP won in the Annapolis Valley and Central Nova Scotia for the first time, winning the seats of Kings North, Kings South, Truro-Bible Hill, Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley and Cumberland North.\n\nDexter's party won the general election held on June 9, 2009 and became the first NDP government in Nova Scotia, and the first in Atlantic Canada. He was sworn in as Premier of Nova Scotia on June 19, 2009.\n\nDexter's party lost the general election held on October 8, 2013. He served as premier until his successor Stephen McNeil was sworn in as the 28th Premier of Nova Scotia on October 22, 2013.\n\nThe Dexter government struggled for the first year of its mandate to control spending on public programs while increasing revenue. It paid off when Dexter's minister of finance Graham Steele posted the provincial budget on April 4, 2011, showing a $447 million surplus – one of the largest in Nova Scotia's history and only the 7th time the debt was paid down since 1950. Major factors in recording this surplus were a one-time adjustment from the federal government of almost $200 million as well as an increase to the HST by two percentage points. However, Dexter's government also made several unpopular decisions, including removing the freeze on tuition fee hikes for Nova Scotia universities as well as budget cuts and freezes in public education and health care spending.\n\nThe first year in office, Dexter and his NDP government sat in the legislature for more days than the previous government's last four sessions combined; the Conservatives sat 15 days in the Fall of 2007, 21 days in the Spring of 2008, 16 days in the Fall of 2008 and 3 days in the Spring of 2009 when an election was called. Dexter's NDP government sat for 35 days in the Fall of 2009 and 32 days in the Spring of 2010.\n\nLegislative highlights in the first year included the province beginning to help cover the travel cost for out-of-province medical care, increasing funding to women's shelters for the first time in a decade, creating a Graduate Retention Rebate for graduates who stay in Nova Scotia, banning uranium mining and the use of cosmetic pesticides, banning political donations by unions and businesses, and launching a new renewable energy strategy with a target of 40% renewable energy by 2020.\n\nIn December 2009, at an international summit in Copenhagen, Dexter was awarded a Climate Leadership in Canada award for putting a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cap on electricity in Nova Scotia.\n\nIn Dexter's first year as Premier two significant stories caused controversy for the NDP government and Nova Scotia's MLAs. On February 3, 2010, Nova Scotia auditor general Jacques Lapointe released a report stating that many Nova Scotia politicians had filed expense claims that were \"excessive or inappropriate\" because of inadequate spending controls that invite errors and misuse. Lapointe's report found that politicians had used taxpayers' money to buy items including televisions, cameras and other electronic equipment, custom-made furniture, model boats, and espresso makers. Lapointe's report questioned the appropriateness of the spending habits of all three main political parties. Dexter himself expensed $7,650 for a pair of laptops and a digital camera, while taxpayers picked up his annual $3,500 professional fee to the Nova Scotia Barrister's Society. Dexter later rejected a call for a public inquiry into the MLA spending scandal, saying that due to the Auditor General's report, excessive and inappropriate spending by MLAs would be curtailed. Dexter promised reforms to the expense system, and the first bill he introduced in the spring of 2010 was An Act to Establish a Management Commission for the Effective Administration of the House of Assembly, saying \"I promised Nova Scotians that their demands for an open and transparent system for MLA expenses would be met.\" \n\nThree former and one incumbent Member of the Legislative Assembly, Liberals Dave Wilson, Russell MacKinnon, Progressive Conservative Richard Hurlburt, and former NDP turned Independent MLA Trevor Zinck were criminally charged for their involvement.\n\nThe second controversy occurred on February 25, 2010, when Elections Nova Scotia fined the governing NDP $10,000, the maximum fine under the governing act, for accepting an illegal campaign donation from a trade union, referring the case to police. The agency said the NDP took more than $5,000 from a single donor and failed to return $45,000 from eight unions and one union affiliate, though it \"knew or should have known\" the money was all from the Mainland Building and Construction Trades Council. After the release of the report, Dexter stated that he had believed the money had been returned. Party secretary Ed Wark resigned, citing a \"serious error in judgment\".\n\nThe Dexter government used the second year of its mandate to continue to get spending under control while increasing revenue. Dexter also lobbied the federal government on helping with \"nation-building\" projects including the Lower Churchill Falls renewable energy project from Newfoundland to Nova Scotia and awarding a national ship building contract to the Halifax shipyard.\n\nDexter's NDP government continued to sit in the legislature for double the days of the previous government. Significant legislation in the second year included creating the province's first debt-cap for university students, a tax reduction for small business, an Auditor General Act giving that office more power and access to information, an indefinite moratorium on oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank, and Canada's first \"Lemon Law\" which requires used car dealers to give buyers more information.\n\nTwo decisions saw significant opposition during Dexter's second year as Premier. The first was his government's replacing an early learning program called Reading Recovery with Succeeding in Reading. Critics were concerned changing programs would hurt children's literacy, while advocates argued that the old program was too expensive and the new program would help more children in more grades.\n\nBusiness advocates were concerned that a bill that was barely debated by the opposition in the legislature in the bill's first stages would give power to labour unions, and they held up passage of the bill by several weeks. The bill combined the activities of six boards into one unified Labour Board and created a Labour Management Review Committee that consisted of managers and employees from unionized workplaces. Critics wanted non-unionized business people to have a say in how workplaces become unionized and worried about a preamble that supported including collective bargaining as part of the Freedom to Assemble, while advocates argued that the committee was required by law to consult with businesses and that the preamble had been in the Canada Labour Code since 1972. The government amended the bill to guarantee non-unionized businesses are consulted on potential labour changes affecting matters including union drives.\n\nThe 2011 budget was tabled on April 5. Although the final figures for 2010 showed a surprising surplus, Dexter's Finance Minister Graham Steele estimated a deficit for 2011 of $389 million, and promised to continue with their 4-year plan to get Nova Scotia out of unsustainable spending through both economic growth and trimming department budgets. The NDP pledged to reduce debt servicing costs, expand their ban March Madness spending in departments, keep unbudgeted spending low and continue to review department programs. The budget also pledged to open Canada's first Collaborative Emergency Centres as a way of keeping emergency health services in rural Nova Scotia, reduce the price of prescription drugs for people on Medicare, provide tax relief by increasing the Basic Personal Amount, and give more money to people living on income assistance. Critics suggested the projected deficit was higher than it should be as a way of the government providing good news when the deficit turns out to be lower and called for more cuts and faster cuts, while Dexter's government said unpredictable conditions in the worldwide economy required caution and stated the opposition would need to explain where extra cuts would come from.\n\nThe third year of Dexter's mandate brought significant news for the province. The Halifax Shipyard was awarded the federal shipbuilding contract, and the NDP announced an agreement with Newfoundland on the Lower Churchill project to bring hydroelectricity to Nova Scotia. Dexter's government also opened Canada's first Collaborative Emergency Centres to start to address emergency room closures in rural Nova Scotia.\n\nSignificant legislation in the third year included re-creating Nova Scotia's independent Arts Council, capping cellphone contract cancellation fees, scheduling a reduction in the HST by one point in 2014 and another point in 2015, and reducing the small business tax for the third year in a row.\n\nTwo decisions drew substantial opposition during Dexter's third year as Premier. Both the Conservatives and Liberals tried to block a labour-friendly bill on First Contract Arbitration. The bill meant that if employees voted democratically to form a union but could not reach an agreement with their employer on a first-contract, then an arbitrator would create one to avoid a strike. Critics said the legislation showed the NDP was on the side of workers instead of business, while advocates pointed out that similar legislation exists across Canada regardless of which party is in power, reduced the number of work stoppages, and did not lead to job losses in other provinces.\n\nThe second controversy involved his government's work to try to save the forestry and pulp and paper industries in the province. While both opposition parties eventually voted for the legislation to help the paper mill in Queens County, some criticized the move to protect jobs as too costly while others applauded the moves to save the economies of the towns of Liverpool and Port Hawkesbury. In the end, the government support was not enough and the Bowater plant in Liverpool closed.\n\nThe 2012 budget was tabled on April 12. Dexter made a surprise announcement the day before Finance Minister Graham Steele's budget, announcing that the HST would be reduced by 1 point in 2014 and a second point in 2015.\n\nThe budget continued with the NDP's four-year plan to stop Nova Scotia's unsustainable spending through both economic stimulus and holding the line on department budgets. The budget also pledged to open more Collaborative Emergency Centres, help the poor and disabled, provide more needs-based grants to university students, and invest heavily in rural road and highway repair. The budget projected a deficit of $211.2 million, slightly better than the $215.8 million deficit anticipated in the province's fiscal plan, and projected a surplus in the next year.\n\nAs Dexter's third year as Premier came to an end, two long-time colleagues announced they would not re-offer when the next election is called. Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Bill Estabrooks and Finance Minister Graham Steele stepped down from Cabinet and were replaced by Antigonish MLA Maurice Smith and Nova Scotia's first ever female Finance Minister Maureen MacDonald.\n\nThe fourth year of Dexter's government included the introduction of a balanced budget, and significant debate over the Maritime Link project with the province of Newfoundland.\n\nSignificant legislation in the fourth year included stronger protection for animals, cyber-safety laws, the Betty Bauman law, and reducing the small business tax for the fourth year in a row.\n\nOne topic saw substantial debate throughout the year was the question of whether to move forward with the Maritime Link project, which would bring in hydroelectricity from Newfoundland at a fixed rate over 35 years. Opponents suggested Nova Scotia should move slower on renewable energy, or import energy from Hydro-Québec instead. Proponents of the deal said it was made in Atlantic Canada solution, would put Nova Scotia into an \"energy loop\" and allow the province to meet both its green-house gas emissions requirements and renewable energy targets.\n\nThe 2012 budget was tabled on April 4, and presented a small surplus of $16.4 million, ending the NDP's four-year plan to get \"back to balance\". The budget also invested in more Collaborative Emergency Centres, insulin pump funding for children, expanded dental care coverage for children, expanded newborn screening, and tax breaks for low income seniors.\n\nThe Dexter government was defeated in the 2013 provincial election which saw the NDP collapse to only 7 seats, reducing it to third party status in the legislature behind the Liberals and Tories. This was mainly due to a near-meltdown in Halifax, the party's power base for almost two decades; the NDP went from holding 14 of the capital's 20 seats to only two. Dexter ran in Cole Harbour-Portland Valley, essentially a reconfigured version of his old seat, and lost to Liberal Tony Ince by only 21 votes. He was the first sitting premier of Nova Scotia to be unseated in his own riding since Ernest Armstrong in 1925. Eight other members of his cabinet were defeated. On November 16, 2013, Dexter announced he would resign as NDP leader, effective November 23, 2013.\n"}

Classical authors such as Julius Caesar and Strabo clearly distinguish them from the other peoples of Gaul, and note their similarity to others in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nDuring the process of Romanization, they gradually adopted the Latin Language (Vulgar Latin) and Roman civilization. Their old language, the Aquitanian language was precursor of the Basque language and the substrate for the Gascon language (one of the Romance languages) spoken in Gascony.\n\nAt the time of the Roman conquest, Julius Caesar, who defeated them in his campaign in Gaul, describes them as making up a distinct part of Gaul:\n\nDespite apparent cultural and linguistic connections to Iberia (Vascones) and to Iberians, the area of Aquitania, as a part of Gaul ended at the Pyrenees according to Caesar:\n\nThe presence, on late Romano-Aquitanian funerary slabs, of what seem to be the names of deities or people similar to certain names in modern Basque have led many philologists and linguists to conclude that Aquitanian was closely related to an older form of Basque. Julius Caesar draws a clear line between the Aquitani, living in present-day south-western France and speaking Aquitanian, and their neighboring Celts living to the north. The fact that the region was known as Vasconia in the Early Middle Ages, a name that evolved into the better known form of Gascony, along with other toponymic evidence, seems to corroborate that assumption.\n\nAlthough the country where the original Aquitanians lived came to be named \"Novempopulania\" (nine peoples) in the late years of the Roman Empire and Early Middle Ages (up to the 6th century), the number of tribes varied (about 20 for Strabo, but comparing with the information of other classical authors such as Pliny, Ptolemy and Julius Caesar, the total number were 32 or 33):\n\n\nIn the southern slopes of western Pyrenees Mountains, not in Aquitania but in northern Hispania Tarraconensis:\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1953 to 1958, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\nScott was born in Winnipeg, the son of Thomas A. Scott and Lydia Baird. He owned a bakery business, and was a city councillor in Winnipeg before entering provincial politics.\n\nScott first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1949 provincial election, in the four-member constituency of Winnipeg South. During this period, Manitoba's provincial elections were determined by a single transferable ballot. Although he finished third on the first ballot, he fell behind in subsequent transfers and narrowly missed election, losing to Liberal-Progressive Paul Bardal by 200 votes on the final ballot.

The Kalinga War included one of the largest and bloodiest battles in Indian history. Kalinga did not have a king as it was culturally run without any.\n\nThis is the only major war Ashoka fought after his accession to the throne. In fact this war marks the close of empire building and military conquests of ancient India that began with Maurya king Bindusara. The bloodshed of this war is said to have prompted Ashoka to adopt Buddhism.\n\nThe reasons for invading Kalinga were both political and economic. Kalinga was a prosperous region consisting of peaceful and artistically skilled people. Known as the Utkala, they were the first from the region who traveled offshore to the southeast for trade. For that reason, Kalinga had important ports and a powerful navy. They had an open culture and used a uniform civil code.\n\nKalinga was under the rule of the Nanda Empire until the empire's fall in 321 BCE. Ashoka's grandfather Chandragupta Maurya had previously attempted to conquer Kalinga, but had been repulsed. Ashoka set himself to the task of conquering the newly independent empire as soon as he felt he was securely established on the throne.\nKalinga was a strategic threat to the Maurya empire. It could interrupt communications between Maurya capital Pataliputra and Maurya possessions in central Indian peninsula. Kalinga also controlled the coastline for the trade in bay of Bengal.\n\nThe war was completed in the eighth year of Ashoka's reign, according to his own Edicts of Ashoka, probably in 262 BCE. After a bloody battle for the throne following the death of his father, Ashoka was successful in conquering Kalinga – but the consequences of the savagery changed Ashoka's views on war and led him to pledge to never again wage a war of conquest.\n\nAshoka had seen the bloodshed and felt that he was the cause of the destruction. The whole area of Kalinga was plundered and destroyed. Some of Ashoka's later edicts state that about 150,000 people died on the Kalinga side and an almost equal number of Ashoka's army, though legends among the Odia people – descendants of Kalinga's natives – claim that these figures were highly exaggerated by Ashoka. As per the legends, Kalinga armies caused twice the amount of destruction they suffered. Thousands of men and women were deported from Kalinga and forced to work on clearing wastelands for future settlement. \n\nAshoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the Edicts of Ashoka. The Kalinga War prompted Ashoka, already a non-engaged Buddhist, to devote the rest of his life to ahimsa (non-violence) and to \"dharma-vijaya\" (victory through dharma). Following the conquest of Kalinga, Ashoka ended the military expansion of the empire and began an era of more than 40 years of relative peace, harmony, and prosperity.\n\n\n"}

The name \"Zarzuela\" is thought to be derived from the word \"zarzas\" meaning brambles, due to its function as a hunting lodge, meaning that it is situated amongst the brambles of the King's Hunting Grounds.\nIt was a rectangular, slate-roofed building with two lateral arcades. King Carlos IV had the building altered to adapt it to 18th century fashion, and adorned it with tapestries and porcelain, as well as furniture and his much-loved clocks.\n\nKing Juan Carlos I and his wife, Queen Sofía, have lived in the palace since their marriage in May 1962. After the death of \"Generalísimo\" Francisco Franco in November 1975, the King decided not to occupy his Palace of El Pardo, leaving it for foreign state guests, designating the Palacio de la Moncloa as the residence of the President of the Spanish Government, while they remained at the Zarzuela. The \"Palacio Real\" (Royal Palace) in the centre of Madrid, the former principal residence of the Spanish monarchs, is the official residence of the King, although it is now used only for state occasions.\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, King Felipe VI, then Prince of Asturias, moved into a new residence, a palace built within the grounds of the Palace of La Zarzuela.\n\nThe palace theatre was the place of origin of the Spanish genre of musical drama, \"zarzuela\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1973957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973957", "title": "Fecal Matter (band)", "text": "Fecal Matter (band)\n\nFecal Matter was a short-lived punk rock band from Aberdeen, Washington. The group was formed in 1985 by Kurt Cobain, the future frontman of Nirvana, along with Dale Crover of Melvins and drummer Greg Hokanson. Hokanson was removed from the band over his penchant for Schmidt beer (otherwise known as Animal beer) and mini thins or \"witch speed\", and the negative attitude which came as a result. Melvins members Buzz Osborne (also known as \"King Buzzo\") and Mike Dillard appeared in a later version of the band during rehearsals the following year.\n\nSongs from the group's sole recording session were issued as the \"Illiteracy Will Prevail\" demo tape. With the exception of the song \"Spank Thru\", the tracks from this session remain unreleased officially. A re-recording of \"Downer\" was also released on the first Nirvana album, \"Bleach\". \"Illiteracy Will Prevail\" is the earliest documentation of Cobain's songwriting in circulation, and helped Cobain to establish himself as a composer and performer among his peers in the underground rock scene in Washington state.\n\nFecal Matter formed early in 1985 after Kurt Cobain had dropped out of Aberdeen High School. One of \"several joke bands\" that arose from the circle of friends associated with the Melvins, it initially included Cobain singing and playing guitar, Melvins drummer Dale Crover playing bass, and Greg Hokanson playing drums. The band spent several months rehearsing original material and covers, including songs by The Ramones, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nIn the SeaTac home of Cobain's aunt Mari Earl, Cobain and Crover recorded the \"Illiteracy Will Prevail\" demo on a 4-track recorder. The date of the recording session has been disputed; many have followed Michael Azerrad's dating of the session to December 1985 in his \"\" biography from 1993, while Gillian Gaar contends in her 2012 biography \"Entertain Us!: The Rise of Nirvana\" that Easter break in 1986 is more likely. With Crover playing both bass and drums, the two recorded 13 original songs in total, which Cobain would later remember as a \"totally abrasive\" batch of punk songs reflecting his dual interest in Black Sabbath and Black Flag. Although Crover later dismissed the demo as \"amateurish,\" Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne recalled a \"certain magic\" in the band's simple but effective recording, citing as memorable their \"ability to put something together in an interesting way.\"\n\nLater in 1986, Osborne and former Melvins drummer Mike Dillard joined the group playing bass and drums, respectively. This incarnation rehearsed for a brief time only; Azerrad records Cobain's frustration with Osborne for failing to take the band seriously enough to buy a bass guitar amplifier. The only live performance of this era occurred on May 3, 1986, in Olympia under the name Brown Towel (sometimes reported as \"Brown Cow\"). This short-lived and related project featured Cobain's poetry and lyrics along with Osborne and Crover's musical accompaniment.\n\nFecal Matter disbanded that year while Melvins supported their debut EP, \"Six Songs\".\n\nAlthough the band had become inactive, Cobain continued passing around the Fecal Matter demo tape to friends and peers. His acquaintance Krist Novoselic, with whom Cobain had briefly jammed previously and had wanted to collaborate for some time, heard the tape and particularly liked the song \"Spank Thru\". The two agreed to form a band, which eventually became Nirvana. They began rehearsals later in 1986 for the new project, and reused the Fecal Matter songs \"Downer\", \"Anorexorcist\", and \"Spank Thru\".\n\n\"Spank Thru\" is the only track from the tape to be released officially, arriving on the 2005 Nirvana rarities album \"\". The song's first half satirizes adolescent hard rock and the sentimental love lyrics that arena bands used to veil songs about sex. \"Spank Thru\" develops into a high-energy punk song in its second half, with lyrics about masturbation. According to music theorist Tim Hughes, \"While Cobain is mocking the heavy metal kids who regularly beat him in high school, the frenzied energy he displays simultaneously communicates a sense of the dumb, frustrated, angry state of mind that fueled those beatings.\"\n\n\"Downer\" was re-recorded for Nirvana's \"Bleach\" album but left off it. The song \"Anorexorcist\", part of a nine-minute medley on the Fecal Matter demo, was also re-recorded by Nirvana in a version released on 2004's \"With the Lights Out\" boxed set.\n\n\"Illiteracy Will Prevail\" remained a highly sought-after and elusive item for collectors as Nirvana rose to fame, became extensively bootlegged, and ultimately had their career cut short by Cobain's death in 1994. Numerous forgeries arose before an incomplete, poor-quality version of the demo was leaked in March 2006. A week later, three full songs from the demo were briefly hosted on a MySpace site (\"Sound of Dentage\", \"Bambi Slaughter\" and \"Laminated Effect\"). The clips were confirmed authentic by collector Mike Ziegler and others who had heard the demo.\n\nIn August 2015, the two anonymous leakers shared the content of the whole tape in both mp3 and lossless format. A remastered version is also available.\n\n\nThe titles \"Laminated Effect\" and \"Blather's Log\" are thought to apply to two of the compositions on the cassette, though it is unclear which. The end of \"Sound of Dentage\" features various clips from \"Reefer Madness\" as well as commercial excerpts.\n\n\nRecorded in Burien, Washington, on TEAC A-2340 four-track recorder.

His idea was to help Catholic lay people fulfil their baptismal promises to be able to live their dedication to the Church in an organised structure, which would be supported by fraternity and prayer. The Legion draws its inspiration from Louis de Montfort's book \"True Devotion to Mary\".\n\nThe Legion first started out by visiting women with cancer in hospitals, but it soon became active among the most destitute, notably among Dublin prostitutes. Duff subsequently laid down the system of the Legion in the \"Handbook of the Legion of Mary\" in 1928.\n\nThe Legion soon spread around the world. At first, it was often met with mistrust because of its then-unusual dedication to lay apostolate. After Pope Pius XI praised it in 1931, the Legion had its mistrust quelled.\n\nMost prominent for spreading the legion was Edel Quinn for her activities in Africa in the 1930s and the 1940s. Her dedication to the mission of the legion, even in the face of her ill health (tuberculosis) brought her great admiration inside and outside the legion. A canonisation process is currently under way for the legendary Quinn, and a beatification process is currently underway for Duff, and for Alfie Lambe (1932–1959), Legion Envoy to South America.\n\nMembership in Ireland had been declining, but the Concilium's efforts to attract younger by the \"Deus et Patria\" movement has caused a substantial increase in membership.\n\nOn 27 March 2014, the Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, Bishop Josef Clemens, delivered the decree in which the Legion is recognised by the Holy See as International Association of the Faithful.\n\nThe basic unit of the Legion is called a Praesidium, which is normally based in a parish. The Praesidium, usually a group of 3–20 members, meets weekly in its parish. The Curia is the next level, each supervising several Praesidia.\n\nThe next level is the Comitium, which is in charge of several Curiae, usually over an area like a medium city or a part of a province. The next level is the Regia, which is in charge of larger territories like a province or state (like in the US and Brazil). The Senatus is the next level, and it generally has control over the Regiae in a very large area, usually a country or a very large territory. T\n\nThe Concilium is the highest level and has its seat in Dublin. It has control over the whole Legion.\n\nEach level of the Legion has the same officers: the President, the Vice-President, the Secretary, the Treasurer, and the Spiritual Director. The last is always in the clergy, but all other offices are held by the laity. All positions regardless of responsibility are voluntary and the Legion has no paid workers.\n\nMembership is open to all baptised Catholics. After visiting a Praesidium a few times, one can join the legion as a probationary member for three months. Then, a decision is made on whether to join the legion as an active member permanently. During the probationary period, probationary members learn about the legion system by reading the \"Handbook of the Legion of Mary\" and its active works by listening to reports of active works undertaken by fellow legionaries. At the end of probationary period, members say an oath of \"Legion promise\", a pledge of allegiance to the Holy Spirit and to Mary, and become apermanent active members.\n\nMembership in the Legion of Mary is essentially based on discipline and commitment. Members devote their time and prayer for the intentions of Mary, Mother of God.\n\nMembers can withdraw from the Legion by informing the president of his or her praesidium.\n\nThe Legion of Mary consists of two totally-different memberships, active and the auxiliary members. Both are essential to the Legion: \"Just as a bird cannot fly without one wing, so also the Legion cannot exist without any of the other members,\" said Ráinel Lobo of Mumbai, India.\n\nActive members regularly attend the weekly sessions of their \"Praesidium\" and pray daily the prayer of the Legion, the \"Catena Legionis\", which consists essentially of the Magnificat and some shorter prayers. Their main role lies in active apostolate for the legion and the church. Active members under 18 are not allowed to give the \"Legion promise\" until that age. They are considered Juniors and may hold any office except President in their \"Praesidium\". Above the level of the \"Praesidium\", no Junior may serve as an officer.\n\nAuxiliary members support the legion through their prayer. They pray the whole booklet of Legion prayers, the Tessera, every day. The \"Tessera\" consists of the Invocation, prayers to the Holy Spirit, the Rosary, the Catena, and the concluding prayers of the \"Tessera\".\n\nPraetorians, a higher grade of active membership, pray, in addition to their duties as active members, the Rosary, the Divine Office and go to Holy Mass daily.\n\nAdjutorians, a higher grade of auxiliary membership, additionally pray the Divine Office and go to Holy Mass daily.\n\nPraetorians and Adjutors do not have higher status or higher rank inside the legion system. The meaning of the grades is only a desire for a more devotional life, not for higher status. Entering the grade is done by registering with a list of Praetorians/Adjutors and by subsequently observing their duties.\n\nThe Praesidia normally meet weekly; larger entities normally monthly or more rarely.\n\nFor all sessions, the Altar of the Legion is set up. It has a statue of the Virgin Mary (represented standing on a globe, her arms extended, crushing the serpent with her foot), which is placed on a white tablecloth, which has \"Legio Mariae\" written on it. On the two sides of the statue are placed two vases with flowers, often roses (the flower connected with Mary). On the front ends of the cloth are two candlesticks with burning candles. On the right side of Mary, the vexillum Legionis (the standard of the legion) is placed. It is made out of metal and onyx and shows the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove as well as the Miraculous Medal.\n\nDuring meetings, all the prayers of the Tessera are said. The sessions start out with the introductory prayers to the Holy Spirit and to Mary. They include five decades of the Rosary. The next part of the session includes a spiritual reading and administrative matters. The members tell briefly how they fulfilled their tasks assigned to them at the previous session. They also discuss and/or read a chapter from the \"Handbook of the Legion\". Then, the \"Catena Legionis\" is prayed, and the Spiritual Director or, if absent, the President holds a short sermon about spiritual matters (\"allocutio\"). Finally, the new tasks for the legionaries are distributed. Each meeting ends with the concluding prayers of the \"Tessera\" and a prayer for Duff's beatification.\n\nThe spirituality of the Legion of Mary is essentially based on the approach of Louis de Montfort, as put forward in his \"True Devotion to Mary\". The book promotes a \"total dedication\" to Christ through devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, which later influenced popes such as John Paul II, who mentions it in an apostolic letter, \"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\".\n\nAnother important element that shapes its spirituality is Duff's devotion to the Holy Spirit. He promoted the adoration of the third person of the Trinity, which he considered neglected. He saw the Virgin Mary as the \"visible image\" of the Spirit; the Legion's introductory prayers and legion promise are directed to the Holy Spirit. The Legion's \"vexillium legionis\" bears the Holy Spirit's image in the form of a dove.\n\nThe essential aim of the Legion of Mary is the sanctification of its members through prayer, the sacraments and devotion to Mary and the Trinity, and of the whole world through the apostolate of the legion.\n\nThe idea of a Catholic lay apostolate organisation where ordinary laypeople in all situations of life would work for their own sanctification and for the conversion of the world was the first of its kind. After the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) promoted such ideas in its conciliar documents, this approach gain wider acceptance in the Catholic Church.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1973998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973998", "title": "Devil facial tumour disease", "text": "Devil facial tumour disease\n\nDevil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is an aggressive non-viral clonally transmissible cancer which affects Tasmanian devils, a marsupial native to Australia. DFTD was first described in 1996. In the subsequent decade the disease ravaged Tasmania's wild devils. Affected high-density populations suffered up to 100% mortality in 12–18 months. Between 1996 and 2015, DFTD wiped out 95% of affected colonies.\n\nThere is often more than one primary tumour. Visible signs of DFTD begin with lumps of soft tissue around the mouth, which ulcerate. Tumours are locally aggressive, destroying the underlying bone of the jaw which interferes with feeding. Tumours may also cover the eyes. Devils usually die within six months from organ failure, secondary infection, or metabolic starvation.\n\nDFTD is rare in juveniles. It affects males and females equally.\n\nThe most plausible route of transmission is through biting, particularly when canine teeth come into direct contact with the diseased cells. Other modes of transmission may include the ingestion of infected carcasses and the sharing of food, both of which involve an allogeneic transfer of cells between unrelated individuals. The animals most likely to become infected are the fittest devil individuals.\n\nDFTD tumours are large soft tissue masses which become centrally ulcerated. The tumours are composed of lobules of nodules of round to spindle-shaped cells, often within a pseudocapsule. Tumours metastasise to regional lymph nodes involvement and systemically to the lungs, spleen and heart.\n\nTasmanian devil cells have 14 chromosomes; the oldest-known strain of the tumour cells have thirteen chromosomes, nine of which are recognisable and four of which are mutated \"marker\" chromosomes. More recently evolved strains have an additional mutant marker chromosome, for a total of fourteen chromosomes. Researchers identified the cancer as a neuroendocrine tumour, and found identical chromosomal rearrangements in all the cancer cells. The karyotype anomalies of DFTD cells are similar to those of cancer cells from canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT), a cancer of dogs that is transmitted by physical contact. Among the mutations present in the tumour genome is trisomy in chromosome 5p, as well as several single base mutations, and short insertions and deletions, e.g., deletions in the chromosomes 1, 2 and 3. Some of the mutated or deleted genes in DFTD are RET, FANCD2, MAST3 and BTNL9-like gene.\n\nClassical DFTD likely originated in the Schwann cells of a single devil. Schwann cells are found in the peripheral nervous system, and produce myelin and other proteins essential for the functions of nerve cells in the peripheral nervous system. Researchers sampled 25 tumours and found that the tumours were genetically identical. Using deep sequencing technology, the study authors then profiled the tumours' transcriptome, the set of genes that are active in tumours; the transcriptomes closely matched those of Schwann cells, revealing high activity in many of the genes coding for myelin basic protein production. Several specific markers were identified, including the MBP and PRX genes, which may enable veterinarians to more easily distinguish DFTD from other types of cancer, and may eventually help identify a genetic pathway that can be targeted to treat it.\n\nIn 2015, a second genetically distinct strain of DFTD was identified, which was tetraploid, not diploid like the main form of the cancer. The tetraploid form has been linked to lower mortality rates. The cell type origin of this strain of DFTD is unknown. Increased levels of tetraploidy have been shown to exist in the oldest strain of DFTD as of 2014, which correlates with the point at which devils became involved in a DFTD removal programme. Because ploidy slows the tumour growth rate, the DFTD removal programme has been suggested as a selective pressure favouring slower-growing tumours, and more generally that disease eradication programmes aimed at DFTD may encourage the evolution of DFTD. The existence of multiple strains may complicate attempts to develop a vaccine, and there are reports of concerns that the evolution of the cancer may allow it to spread to related species such as the quoll.\n\nWild Tasmanian devil populations are being monitored to track the spread of the disease and to identify changes in disease prevalence. Field monitoring involves trapping devils within a defined area to check for the presence of the disease and determine the number of affected animals. The same area is visited repeatedly to characterise the spread of the disease over time. So far, it has been established that the short-term effects of the disease in an area can be severe. Long-term monitoring at replicated sites will be essential to assess whether these effects remain, or whether populations can recover. Field workers are also testing the effectiveness of disease suppression by trapping and removing diseased devils, with the expectation that removal of diseased devils from wild populations would decrease disease prevalence, allowing devils to survive beyond juvenile years and so to breed. One study reported that a system of culling prior to 2010 did not impede disease spread.\n\nPicking a genetically diverse breeding stock, defined by the genome sequence, may help with conservation efforts. Two \"insurance\" populations of disease-free devils have been established at an urban facility in the Hobart suburb of Taroona and on Maria Island off the east coast of Tasmania. Captive breeding in mainland zoos is also a possibility.\n\nDue to the decreased life expectancy of the devils with DFTD, affected individuals have begun breeding at younger ages in the wild, with reports that many only live to participate in one breeding cycle. Hence, Tasmanian devils appear to have changed breeding habits in response to the disease; females had previously begun to breed annually at age two, for about three more years, dying thereafter of a variety of causes. Populations are now characterised by onset of breeding at age one, dying of DFTD, on average, shortly thereafter. Social interactions have been seen to contribute to spread of DFTD in a local area.\n\nThe decline in devil numbers is also an ecological problem, since its presence in the Tasmanian forest ecosystem is believed to have prevented the establishment of the red fox, with the most recent known organism accidentally being introduced into Tasmania in 1998. Tasmanian devil young may now be more vulnerable to red fox predation, as pups are left alone for long periods of time.\n\nIn response to the impact of DFTD on Tasmanian devil populations, 47 devils have been shipped to mainland Australian wildlife parks to attempt to preserve the genetic diversity of the species. The largest of these efforts is the Devil Ark project in Barrington Tops, New South Wales; an initiative of the Australian Reptile Park. This project aims to create a set of one thousand genetically representative devils, and is now a major focus of the insurance policy. The Tasman peninsula is being considered as a possible \"clean area\" with the single narrow access point controlled by physical barriers. The Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water is experimenting on culling infected animals with some signs of success.\n\nA diagnostic blood test was developed in mid-2009 to screen for the disease. In early 2010, scientists found some Tasmanian devils, mostly in the north-west of Tasmania, that are genetically different enough for their bodies to recognise the cancer as foreign. They have only one major histocompatibility complex, whereas the cancerous cells have both.\n\nOocyte banking may be useful in the conservation effort for Tasmanian devils, as the survival rate of cryopreserved oocytes is 70%.\n\nIn 1996, a photographer from The Netherlands captured several images of devils with facial tumours near Mount William in Tasmania's northeast. Around the same time, farmers reported a decline in devil numbers. Menna Jones first encountered the disease in 1999 near Little Swanport, in 2001 capturing three devils with facial tumours on the Freycinet Peninsula.\n\nThe theory that cancer cells themselves could be an infective agent (the Allograft Theory) was first offered in 2006 by Pearse, Swift and colleagues, who analysed DFTD cells from devils in several locations, determining that all DFTD cells sampled were genetically identical to each other, and genetically distinct from their hosts and from all other individual Tasmanian devils whose genetics had been studied; this allowed them to conclude that the cancer originated from a single individual and spread from it, rather than arising repeatedly, and independently. Twenty-one different subtypes have been identified by analysing the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of 104 tumours from different Tasmanian devils. Researchers have also witnessed a previously-uninfected devil develop tumours from lesions caused by an infected devil's bites, supporting the contention that the disease is spread by allograft, with transmission via biting, scratching, and aggressive sexual activity between individuals. During biting, infection can spread from the bitten devil to the biter.\n\nInitially, it was suspected that devils had low genetic diversity, so that their immune system did not recognise the tumour cells as foreign. However, it was later demonstrated that devils are sufficiently genetically diverse to mount a strong immune response to foreign tissue.\n\nSince June 2005, three females have been found that are partially resistant to DFTD.\n\nThe devil population on the peninsula decreased dramatically. In March 2003 Nick Mooney wrote a memo to be circulated within the Parks and Wildlife Services calling for more funding to study the disease, but the call for funding was edited out before the memo was presented to Bryan Green, then Tasmania's Minister for Primary Industries, Water and Environment. In April 2003, a working group was formed by the Tasmanian Government to respond to the disease. In September 2003, Nick Mooney went to the Tasmanian daily newspaper \"The Mercury\", informing the general public of the disease and proposing a quarantine of healthy Tasmanian devils. At the time, it was thought that a retrovirus was a possible cause. David Chadwick of the state Animal Health Laboratory said that the laboratory did not have the resources needed to research the possibility of a retrovirus. The Tasmanian Conservation Trust criticised the Tasmanian government for providing insufficient funds for research and suggested that DFTD could be zoonotic, posing a threat to livestock and humans. On 14 October 2003, a workshop was held in Launceston. In 2004, Kathryn Medlock found three oddly shaped devil skulls in European museums and found a description of a devil in London Zoo dying, which showed a similarity to DFTD.\n\nCalicivirus, 1080 poison, agricultural chemicals, and habitat fragmentation combined with a retrovirus were other proposed causes. Environmental toxins had also been suspected. In March 2006 a devil escaped from a park into an area infected with DFTD. She was recaptured with bite marks on her face, and returned to live with the other devils in the park. She wounded a male and by October both devils had DFTD, which was subsequently spread to two others (an incident that in retrospect would be understood in the context of the allograft theory of transmission).\n\nIn 2006, DFTD was classed a List B notifiable disease under the Government of Tasmania's Animal Health Act 1995. The strategy of developing an insurance population in captivity was developed. It was reassessed in 2008. A 2007 investigation into the immune system of the devils found that when combatting other pathogens, the response from the immune system was normal, leading to suspicion that the devils were not capable of detecting the cancerous cells as \"non-self\". In 2007, it was predicted that populations could become locally extinct within 10–15 years of DFTD occurring, and predicted that the disease would spread across the entire range of the Tasmanian devils causing the devils to become extinct within 25–35 years.\n\nIn 2016, devils are at the verge of extinction as the localised populations were shown to have declined by 90 per cent and an overall species decline of more than 80 per cent in less than 20 years, with some models predicting extinction. Despite this, devil populations persist in disease-stricken areas. The devils have, in a way, fought back the extinction by developing the gene that is immune to face tumors. The genes have already existed in the Tasmanian devil as part of their immune system. They increased in frequency due to natural selection. That is, the individuals with particular forms of these genes (alleles) survived and reproduced disproportionately to those that lacked the specific variants when disease was present.\n\nA devil population in the far southwest of Tasmania has been reported to be free of DFTD.\n\nIn 2008, a devil—given the name Cedric by those who treated and worked with him—was thought to have a natural immunity to the disease, but developed two facial tumours in late 2008. The tumours were removed, and officials thought Cedric was recovering well; but in September 2010, the cancer was discovered to have spread to the lungs, leading to his euthanasia.\n\nVaccination with irradiated cancer cells has not proven successful.\n\nIn 2013, a study using mice as a model for Tasmanian devils suggested that a DFTD vaccine could be beneficial. In 2015, a study which mixed dead DFTD cells with an inflammatory substance stimulated an immune response in five out of six devils injected with the mixture, engendering for a vaccine against DFTD. Field testing of the potential vaccine is being undertaken as a collaborative project between the Menzies Institute for Medical Research and the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program under the Wild Devil Recovery program, and aims to test the immunisation protocol as a tool in ensuring the devil's long term survival in the wild.\n\nIn March 2017, scientists at the University of Tasmania presented an apparent first report of having successfully treated Tasmanian devils with the disease, by injecting live cancer cells into the infected devils to stimulate their immune system to recognise and fight the disease. In 2019, researchers from University Sydney reported constricted diversity of the T cell repertoire in devils with DFTD, suggesting that DFTD may impact the host immune system directly.\n\n"}

It occupies more than in three towns: New Boston, Amherst, and Mont Vernon. It was established in 1942 as a practice area for bombers and fighter planes from nearby Grenier Army Air Field (now Manchester–Boston Regional Airport). Starting in 1959, it was turned into a satellite-tracking station. During the late 1970s and early 1980s it was known as Detachment 1 of the 2014th Communications Squadron located at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Massachusetts.\n\nNew Boston AFS is operated by the 23d Space Operations Squadron (23 SOPS), a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 50th Network Operations Group, 50th Space Wing, Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado.\n\nThe New Boston Air Force Station dates back to 1942, when Grenier Field — now Manchester–Boston Regional Airport — was preparing to meet the demands of World War II.\n\nOn September 5, 1941, Colonel John Moore, commanding officer of the U.S. Army Air Corps at Grenier Field, wrote a letter proposing the government create a bombing range in New Boston near Joe English Pond. \"The nature of the terrain around the pond is such that aerial bombing thereon would offer the elements of surprise, concealed approach and navigation to a point,\" Moore wrote. \"It is believed that Joe English Hill (altitude 1,245 feet) would be a satisfactory stop for any ricochet bullets from ground machine gun targets.\"\n\nEventually, land belonging to 16 families, 12 of them in New Boston, was taken at a cost of $23,200.\n\nThere was no electricity on site, and water had to be brought from Dodge's store in the center of New Boston. Nail kegs were used as chairs. Locals felt so sorry for the soldiers that they donated used furniture.\n\nDuring World War II, local residents remember watching fighters and bombers train at the Air Force station and learned to recognize the sounds of strafing and bombing as they went about their tasks.\n\n\"I'd watch from the kitchen window,\" 89-year-old Evelyn Barss told the \"Nashua Telegraph\" newspaper in a 2005 story. \"They would come in across the hill and drop their bombs and we would see them. These little black specks would go down, and you would hear a small discharge - they didn't use a lot of powder because it was scarce during the war.\"\n\nRoland Goodwin worked at the base on and off for three decades and he remembers seeing the tail fins of bombs sticking out of the pond. Planes at one time practiced dropping depth bombs for sinking submarines.\n\n\"Every building we built down there in the early days ... we usually ran into a buried bomb of some kind. We'd have to bring people up from Fort Devens [in Massachusetts] to detonate it.\"\n\nAfter the war, the station took a lower profile. The bombing range was deactivated and after a long debate about the site's future, it became home to new satellite tracking antennas. The first antennas went up around 1960 and remain, protected by a geodesic dome resembling a golf ball about six stories high.\n\nIn previous years portions of the station have been open to fisherman, hunters, and loggers, but the station has been closed to most non-military personnel since the attacks of September 11.\n\nA few working farms are in the vicinity; however, most of the area is heavily wooded with pockets of residential development. Commercial development consists primarily of small shopping centers with a few office complexes along NH State Route 101 to the southeast.\n\nNew Boston AFS consists mostly of undeveloped, forested land with extensive wetlands. Local, state, and federal laws governing the preservation of natural, cultural, and environmental resources play a major role in limiting development on and around the station.\n\nThe station lies within the Merrimack River watershed. Fourteen freshwater ponds fed by springs or streams, which occupy approximately 100 acres (405,000 m²), and seven miles (11 km) of streams exist on the station. The ponds are bordered by wetlands, and the streams by riparian vegetation. Riffle and pool habitats are favorable for many cold water fish species. Wetland types include freshwater emergent marshes of variable depths, wet meadows, shrub and deciduous wooded swamps such as red maple and black gum swamps, and a red spruce bog. This bog contains a deep peat layer.\n\nOf all the water bodies on the station, only Joe English Pond appears on the list of protected water bodies under the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Comprehensive Shoreline Protection Act (CSPA).\n\n"}
{"id": "1974006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974006", "title": "Palace of Moncloa", "text": "Palace of Moncloa\n\nThe Palace of Moncloa or Moncloa Palace () is the official residence and workplace of the Prime Minister of Spain. It is located in Puerta de Hierro Avenue, in the Moncloa-Aravaca district in Madrid. It has been the official residence of the Prime Minister of Spain since 1977, when Adolfo Suárez moved the residence from the Palace of Villamejor.\n\nThe Moncloa Complex includes 16 buildings, a bunker and a hospital. The Ministry of the Presidency, the Deputy Prime Minister's Office, the Cabinet Office, the Chief of Staff's Office and the Press Office are located in this complex. The weekly meetings of the Council of Ministers are also held at La Moncloa.\n\nIn Spain 'Moncloa' is sometimes used as a metonym for the central government, especially when contrasting with the governments of the Autonomous Communities.\n\nThe Moncloa Palace was originally a farm for agricultural use, which, due to its good situation, later became a palace-house. In 1660 it was bought by Gaspar de Haro y Guzmán, Marquis of Carpio and Eliche, owner of the neighboring orchard of La Moncloa, a name that came from its former owners, the Counts of Monclova, which later gave rise to Moncloa, as know today.\n\nWhen the two gardens were joined, Gaspar de Haro had a palace built on the highest part of the land, known first as Eliche's Palace and also as Painted House, in reference to the frescoes that adorned the exterior walls, and later as Palace of La Moncloa.\n\nThe Palace passed through different owners until reaching María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duchess of Alba de Tormes. To his death without descendants in 1802, Charles IV acquired the mansion and the orchard and added it to the Royal Site of La Florida, which was then called Royal Site of La Moncloa. In 1816, Ferdinand VII ordered the restoration of the palace.\n\nThirty years later, Isabella II ceded the property of La Moncloa to the State, which became part of the Ministry of Development. The palace was restored again in 1929, when it was reopened as a museum.\n\nThe Palace was destroyed during the Siege of Madrid in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nA decade after its destruction, the architect Diego Méndez built, between 1949 and 1953, the present building following the model of the Casa del Labrador of Aranjuez. Then it was destined to official residence of heads of State in visits to Spain and high personalities.\n\nBy law of July 15, 1954, the Moncloa Palace and its gardens, with an area of 58,293.81 square meters and adjoining the four cardinal points with land of the University City of Madrid, was integrated into the National Heritage. The new design was adapted to the new functions assigned to the palace, which was inaugurated by Francisco Franco in 1953. On June 3, 1954, arrived the palace's first foreign head of state, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. On November 28, 1976, the last one, Carlos Andrés Pérez.\n\nIn 1977, Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez moved the headquarters of the Presidency of the Government, located until then in the central Villamejor Palace, to La Moncloa. The change occurred, fundamentally, and given the remote location of the palace, away from the center of Madrid, for security reasons, in the face of concern that an attack against the young prime minister, newly appointed by King Juan Carlos I. With the new palace was also established on it the official residence for the Prime Minister and his family.\n\nSince 1977, successive prime ministers have consistently ordered renovations and expansions of the complex. Adolfo Suarez ordered the construction of a tennis court and the renovation of the pool. He also ordered the old main courtyard be covered, which would later become the famous Hall of Columns.\n\nDuring his brief tenure as prime minister in the early 1980s, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo installed more bedrooms on the third floor for his eight children as well as a music room. Felipe González arrived in 1982 and cultivated a small orchard of bonsais. González's major contribution, though, was the construction of an underground bunker inspired by his memory of the coup d'état attempt of February 23, 1981. He also built a new building close to the presidential residence to host the Council of Ministers, dedicating the main building to serve more as the private residence of the prime minister.\n\nJosé María Aznar, Ana Botella, their three sons and two cocker dogs lived at Moncloa between 1996 and 2004. Aznar was responsible for the construction of a game room for his children as well as a paddle tennis court to practice his favorite sport. Sonsoles Espinosa, wife of the Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, decided to radically renovate the private rooms. She favored a minimalist style, painting the rooms light colors, changing classic furniture for different designs (but retaining certain pieces such as the table of General Narváez, a gift from Juan Carlos I to Adolfo Suárez located in the Prime Minister's Office) and hung pictures of contemporary artists on the walls. Mariano Rajoy and his wife did not make many changes that are known beyond swapping out the vases.\nBefore September 19, 2018, the entrance to the palace by the public were not allowed. Only accredited personnel like journalists or public servants were allowed to enter along with universities, high schools and primary schools students. These latter usually make a short tour to know the gardens and the Press Center.\n\nSince September 2018, the new PM Pedro Sánchez allows the public to visit the Complex, not only the Press Room and the Council of Minister's Room but the main buildings of the complex, including the Deputy PM's Office, the Ministry of the Presidency building and the Prime Minister Chief of Staff's Office.\nThere is a tradition in summer by which the prime minister make a tour through the Palace to the children of the employees of the Complex.\n\nThe requirements to visit the governmental complex is to be a Spanish citizen or to live in Spain, ask for a date, show the guards the ID and leave in the entrance all electronic devices.\n\nThe security of the complex is carried out by the Department of Security of the Presidency of the Government, a government body responsible for the protection of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Government's Ministers and former Prime Ministers, along with their families. It also gives protection to the Moncloa Complex and the private and public residences of the members of the Government.\n\nThe security agents come from the Civil Guard and the National Police Corps.\n\nThe building was built in 1989 during the premiership of Felipe González in order to differentiate the residential and working areas of the palace.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office maintains an agreement with the Reina Sofía Museum under which the decoration of the building is composed of works of this museum. The artistic collection consists of more than 140 works by authors such as Joan Miró, Eduardo Chillida, Julio González, Pablo Palazuelo or Antoni Tàpies, among others.

{"id": "1974007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974007", "title": "Independence-friendly logic", "text": "Independence-friendly logic\n\nIndependence-friendly logic (IF logic; proposed by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu in 1989) is an extension of classical first-order logic (FOL) by means of slashed quantifiers of the form formula_1 and formula_2 (formula_3 being a finite set of variables). The intended reading of formula_1 is \"there is a formula_5 which is functionally independent from the variables in formula_3\". IF logic allows one to express more general patterns of dependence between variables than those which are implicit in first-order logic. This greater level of generality leads to an actual increase in expressive power; the set of IF sentences can characterize the same classes of structures as existential second-order logic (formula_7). For example, it can express branching quantifier sentences, such as the formula formula_8 which expresses infinity in the empty signature; this cannot be done in FOL. Therefore, first-order logic cannot, in general, express this pattern of dependency, in which formula_9 depends \"only\" on formula_10 and formula_11, and formula_12 depends \"only\" on formula_13 and formula_11. IF logic is more general than branching quantifiers, for example in that it can express dependencies that are not transitive, such as in the quantifier prefix formula_15 (formula_9 depends on formula_10, and formula_13 depends on formula_9, but formula_13 does not depend on formula_10).\n\nThe introduction of IF logic was partly motivated by the attempt of extending the game semantics of first-order logic to games of imperfect information. Indeed, a semantics for IF sentences can be given in terms of these kinds of games (or, alternatively, by means of a translation procedure to existential second-order logic). A semantics for open formulas cannot be given in the form of a Tarskian semantics (); an adequate semantics must specify what it means for a formula to be satisfied by a set of assignments of common variable domain (a \"team\") rather than satisfaction by a single assignment. Such a \"team semantics\" was developed by Hodges ().\n\nIF logic is translation equivalent, at the level of sentences, with a number of other logical systems based on team semantics, such as dependence logic, dependence-friendly logic, exclusion logic and independence logic; with the exception of the latter, IF logic is known to be equiexpressive to these logics also at the level of open formulas. However, IF logic differs from all the above-mentioned systems in that it lacks \"locality\" (the meaning of an open formula cannot be described just in terms of the free variables of the formula; it is instead dependent on the context in which the formula occurs).\n\nIF logic shares a number of metalogical properties with first-order logic, but there are some differences, including lack of closure under (classical, contradictory) negation and higher complexity for deciding the validity of formulas. Extended IF logic addresses the closure problem, but its game-theoretical semantics is more complicated, and such logic corresponds to a larger fragment of second-order logic, a proper subset of formula_22 ().\n\nHintikka has argued (e.g. in the book ) that IF and extended IF logic should be used as a basis for the foundations of mathematics; this proposal has been met in some cases with skepticism (see e.g.).\n\nA number of slightly different presentations of IF logic have appeared in the literature; here we follow.\n\nTerms and atomic formulas are defined exactly as in first-order logic with equality.\n\nFor a fixed signature σ, formulas of IF logic are defined as follows:\n\n\nThe set formula_35 of the free variables of an IF formula formula_23 is defined inductively as follows:\n\nThe last clause is the only one that differs from the clauses for first-order logic, the difference being that also the variables in the slash set formula_3 are counted as free variables.\n\nAn IF formula formula_23 such that formula_44 is an \"IF sentence\".\n\nThree main approaches have been proposed for the definition of the semantics of IF logic. The first two, based respectively on games of imperfect information and on Skolemization, are mainly used in the definition of IF sentences only. The former generalizes a similar approach, for first-order logic, which was based instead on games of \"perfect\" information.\nThe third approach, \"team semantics\", is a compositional semantics in the spirit of Tarskian semantics. However, this semantics does not define what it means for a formula to be satisfied by an assignment (rather, by a \"set\" of assignments).\nThe first two approaches were developed in earlier publications on if logic (); the third one by Hodges in 1997 ().\n\nIn this section, we differentiate the three approaches by writing distinct pedices, as in formula_45. Since the three approaches are fundamentally equivalent, only the symbol formula_46 will be used in the rest of the article.\n\nGame-Theoretical Semantics assigns truth values to IF sentences according to the properties of some 2-player games of imperfect information. \nFor ease of presentation, it is convenient to associate games not only to sentences, but also to formulas. More precisely, one defines games formula_47 for each triple formed by an IF formula formula_23, a structure formula_49, and an assignment formula_50.\n\nThe semantic game formula_47 has two players, called Eloise (or Verifier) and Abelard (or Falsifier).\n\nThe allowed moves in the semantic game formula_52 are determined by the synctactical structure of the formula under consideration.\nFor simplicity, we first assume that formula_23 is in negation normal form, with negations symbols occurring only in front of atomic subformulas.\n\n\nMore generally, if formula_23 is not in negation normal form, we can state, as a rule for negation, that, when a game formula_72 is reached, the players begin playing a dual game formula_73 in which the roles of Verifiers and Falsifier are switched.\n\nInformally, a sequence of moves in a game formula_52 is a history. At the end of each history formula_75, some subgame formula_76 is played; we call formula_77 the \"assignment associated to\" formula_75, and formula_79 the \"subformula occurrence associated to\" formula_75. The \"player associated to\" formula_75 is Eloise in case the most external logical operator in formula_79 is formula_83 or formula_84, and Abelard in case it is formula_85 or formula_86.\n\nThe set formula_75 of \"allowed moves\" in a history formula_75 is formula_49 if the most external operator of formula_79 is formula_84 or formula_86; it is formula_93 (formula_94 being any two distinct objects, symbolizing 'left' and 'right') in case the most external operator of formula_79 is formula_83 or formula_85.\n\nGiven two assignments formula_98 of same domain, and formula_99 we write formula_100 if formula_101 on any variable formula_102.\n\nImperfect information is introduced in the games by stipulating that certain histories are indistinguishable for the associated player; indistinguishable histories are said to form an 'information set'. Intuitively, if the history formula_75 is in the information set formula_104, the player associated to formula_75 does not know whether he is in formula_75 or in some other history of formula_104.\nConsider two histories formula_108 such that the associated formula_109 are identical subformula occurrences of the form formula_110 (formula_111 or formula_86); if furthermore formula_113, we write formula_114 (in case formula_111) or formula_116 (in case formula_117), in order to specify that the two histories are indistinguishable for Eloise, resp. for Abelard. We also stipulate, in general, reflexivity of this relation: if formula_118, then formula_114; and if formula_120, then formula_116.\n\nFor a fixed game formula_52, write formula_123 for the set of histories to which Eloise is associated, and similarly formula_124 for the set of histories of Abelard.\n\nA \"strategy\" for Eloise in the game formula_52 is any function that assigns, to any possible history in which it is Eloise's turn to play, a legal move; more precisely, any function formula_126 such that formula_127 for every history formula_128. One can define dually the strategies of Abelard.\n\nA strategy for Eloise is \"uniform\" if, whenever formula_114, formula_130; for Abelard, if formula_116 implies formula_130.\n\nA strategy formula_133 for Eloise is \"winning\" if Eloise wins in each terminal history that can be reached by playing according to formula_133. Similarly for Abelard.\n\nAn IF sentence formula_23 is \"true\" in a structure formula_49 (formula_137) if Eloise has a uniform winning strategy in the game formula_138. \nIt is \"false\" (formula_139) if Abelard has a winning strategy.\nIt is \"undetermined\" if neither Eloise nor Abelard has a winning strategy.\n\nThe semantics of IF logic thus defined is a conservative extension of first-order semantics, in the following sense. If formula_23 is an IF sentence with empty slash sets, associate to it the first-order formula formula_141 which is identical to it, except in that each IF quantifier formula_142 is replaced by the corresponding first-order quantifier formula_143. Then formula_137 iff formula_145 in the Tarskian sense; and formula_139 iff formula_147 in the Tarskian sense.\n\nMore general games can be used to assign a meaning to (possibly open) IF formulas; more exactly, it is possible to define what it means for an IF formula formula_23 to be satisfied, on a structure formula_49, by a \"team\" formula_150 (a set of assignments of common variable domain formula_151 and codomain formula_49).\nThe associated games formula_153 begin with the random choice of an assignment formula_154; after this initial move, the game \nformula_155 is played. The existence of a winning strategy for Eloise defines \"positive satisfaction\" (formula_156), and existence of a winning strategy for Abelard defines \"negative satisfaction\" (formula_157).\nAt this level of generality, Game-theoretical Semantics can be replaced by an algebraic approach, \"team semantics\" (defined below).\n\nA definition of truth for IF sentences can be given, alternatively, by means of a translation into existential second-order logic. The translation generalizes the Skolemization procedure of first-order logic. Falsity is defined by a dual procedure called Kreiselization.\n\nGiven an IF formula formula_23, we first define its skolemization relativized to a finite set formula_159 of variables. For every existential quantifier formula_1 occurring in formula_23, let formula_162 be a new function symbol (a \"Skolem function\"). We write formula_163 for the formula which is obtained substituting, in formula_23, all free occurrences of the variable formula_5 with the term formula_166. The Skolemization of formula_23 relative to formula_168, formula_169, is defined by the following inductive clauses:\n\n\nIf formula_23 is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Skolemization is defined as formula_179.\n\nGiven an IF formula formula_23, associate, to each universal quantifier formula_2 occurring in it, a new function symbol formula_182 (a \"Kreisel function\"). Then, the Kreiselization formula_183 of formula_23 relative to a finite set of variables formula_185, is defined by the following inductive clauses:\n\n\nIf formula_23 is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Kreiselization is defined as formula_195.\n\nGiven an IF sentence formula_23 with formula_197 existential quantifiers, a structure formula_49, and a list formula_199of formula_197 functions of appropriate arities, we denote as formula_201 the expansion of formula_49 which assigns the functions formula_199 as interpretations for the Skolem functions of formula_23.\n\nAn IF sentence is true on a structure formula_49 (formula_206) iff there is a tuple formula_199 of functions such that formula_208.\nSimilarly, formula_209 iff there is a tuple formula_199 of functions such that formula_211; and formula_212 iff neither of the previous conditions holds.\n\nFor any IF sentence, Skolem Semantics returns the same values as Game-theoretical Semantics.\n\nBy means of team semantics, it is possible to give a compositional account of the semantics of IF logic. Truth and falsity are grounded on the notion of 'satisfiability of a formula by a team'.\n\nLet formula_213 be a structure and let formula_214 be a finite set of variables. Then a team over formula_49 with domain formula_3 is a set of assignments over formula_49 with domain formula_3, that is, a set of functions formula_219 from formula_3 to formula_49.\n\nDuplicating and supplementing are two operations on teams which are related to the semantics of universal and existential quantification.\n\n\n\nIt is customary to replace repeated applications of these two operation with more succinct notations, such as formula_233 for formula_234.\n\nAs above, given two assignments formula_98 with same variable domain, we write formula_100 if formula_101 for every variable formula_102.\n\nGiven a team formula_150 on a structure formula_49 and a finite set formula_3 of variables, we say that a function formula_229 is formula_3-uniform if formula_244 whenever formula_245.\n\nTeam semantics is three-valued, in the sense that a formula may happen to be positively satisfied by a team on a given structure, or negatively satisfied by it, or neither. The semantics clauses for positive and negative satisfaction are defined by simultaneous induction on the synctactical structure of IF formulas.\n\nPositive satisfaction:\n\n\nNegative satisfaction:\n\n\nAccording to team semantics, an IF sentence formula_23 is said to be true (formula_299) on a structure formula_49 if it is satisfied on formula_49 by the singleton team formula_302, in symbols: formula_303. \nSimilarly, formula_23 is said to be false (formula_305) on formula_49 if formula_307; it is said to be undetermined (formula_308) if formula_309 and formula_310.\n\nFor any team formula_150 on a structure formula_49, and any IF formula formula_23, we have:\nformula_314 iff formula_315\nand\nformula_316 iff formula_317.\n\nFrom this it immediately follows that, for sentences formula_23, formula_319, formula_320 and formula_321.\n\nSince IF logic is, in its usual acception, three-valued, multiple notions of formula equivalence are of interest.\n\nLet formula_322 be two IF formulas.\n\nformula_323 (formula_23 \"truth entails\" formula_27) if formula_326 for any structure formula_49 and any team formula_150 such that formula_329.\n\nformula_330 (formula_23 is \"truth equivalent\" to formula_27) if formula_323 and formula_334.\n\nformula_335 (formula_23 \"falsity entails\" formula_27) if formula_338 for any structure formula_49 and any team formula_150 such that formula_329.\n\nformula_342 (formula_23 is \"falsity equivalent\" to formula_27) if formula_335 and formula_346.\n\nformula_347 (formula_23 \"strongly entails\" to formula_27) if formula_323 and formula_335.\n\nformula_352 (formula_23 is \"strongly equivalent\" to formula_27) if formula_330 and formula_342.\n\nThe definitions above specialize for IF sentences as follows.\nTwo IF sentences formula_322 are \"truth equivalent\" if they are true in the same structures; they are \"falsity equivalent\" if they are false in the same structures; they are \"strongly equivalent\" if they are both truth and falsity equivalent.\n\nIntuitively, using strong equivalence amounts to considering IF logic as 3-valued (true/undetermined/false), while truth equivalence treats IF sentences as if they were 2-valued (true/untrue).\n\nMany logical rules of IF logic can be adequately expressed only in terms of more restricted notions of equivalence, which take into account the context in which a formula might appear.\n\nFor example, if formula_168 is a finite set of variables and formula_359, one can state that formula_23 is \"truth equivalent to\" formula_27 \"relative to\" formula_168 (formula_363) in case formula_364 for any structure formula_49 and any team formula_150 \"of domain\" formula_168.\n\nIF sentences can be translated in a truth-preserving fashion into sentences of (functional) existential second-order logic (formula_368) by means of the Skolemization procedure (see above). Vice versa, every formula_368 can be translated into an IF sentence by means of a variant of the Walkoe-Enderton translation procedure for partially-ordered quantifiers (). In other words, IF logic and formula_368 are expressively equivalent at the level of sentences. This equivalence can be used to prove many of the properties that follow; they are inherited from formula_368 and in many cases similar to properties of FOL.\n\nWe denote by formula_372 a (possibly infinite) set of IF sentences.\n\n\nThe notion of satisfiability by a team has the following properties:\n\n\nSince IF formulas are satisfied by teams and formulas of classical logics are satisfied by assignments, there is no obvious intertranslation between IF formulas and formulas of some classical logic system. However, there is a translation procedure of IF formulas into \"sentences\" of \"relational\" formula_368 (actually, one distinct translation formula_401 for each finite formula_159 and for each choice of a predicate symbol formula_251 of arity formula_404). In this kind of translation, an extra n-ary predicate symbol formula_251 is used to represent an n-variable team formula_150. This is motivated by the fact that, once an ordering formula_407 of the variables of formula_151 has been fixed, it is possible to associate a relation formula_409 to the team formula_150. With this conventions, an IF formula is related to its translation thus:\nwhere formula_412 is the expansion of formula_49 that assigns formula_414 as interpretation for the predicate formula_251.\n\nThrough this correlation, it is possible to say that, on a structure formula_49, an IF formula formula_23 of n free variables \"defines\" a family of n-ary relations over formula_49 (the family of the relations formula_414 such that formula_420).\n\nIn 2009, Kontinen and Väänänen, showed, by means of a partial inverse translation procedure, that the families of relations that are definable by IF logic are exactly those that are nonempty, downward closed and definable in relational formula_368 with an extra predicate formula_251 (or, equivalently, nonempty and definable by a formula_368 sentence in which formula_251 occurs only negatively).\n\nIF logic is not closed under classical negation. The boolean closure of IF logic is known as extended IF logic and it is equivalent to a proper fragment of formula_22 (Figueira et al. 2011). Hintikka (1996, p. 196) claimed that \"virtually all of classical mathematics can in principle be done in extended IF first-order logic\".\n\nA number of properties of IF logic follow from logical equivalence with formula_7 and bring it closer to first-order logic including a compactness theorem, a Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, and a Craig interpolation theorem. (Väänänen, 2007, p. 86). However, Väänänen (2001) proved that the set of Gödel numbers of valid sentences of IF logic with at least one binary\npredicate symbol (set denoted by \"Val\") is recursively isomorphic with the corresponding set of Gödel numbers of valid (full) second-order sentences in a vocabulary that contains one binary predicate symbol (set denoted by \"Val\"). Furthermore, Väänänen showed that \"Val\" is the complete Π-definable set of integers, and that it is \"Val\" not in formula_427 for any finite \"m\" and \"n\". Väänänen (2007, pp. 136–139) summarizes the complexity results as follows:\n\nFeferman (2006) cites Väänänen's 2001 result to argue (contra Hintikka) that while satisfiability might be a first-order matter, the question of whether there is a winning strategy for Verifier over all structures in general \"lands us squarely in \"full second order logic\"\" (emphasis Feferman's). Feferman also attacked the claimed usefulness of the extended IF logic, because the sentences in formula_428 do not admit a game-theoretic interpretation.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958.\n\nBorn in Larne, Northern Ireland, the son of Nathaniel Turk and Mary O'Lynn, Turk came to Canada with his family in 1910 and was educated at Lord Selkirk School. In 1931, he married Annie Owens. He was a wrestling promoter and president of the Giants Baseball Club and was known in politics as a charismatic showman. Some credit him with introducing modern professional wrestling to Manitoba in 1946 with his company, the NWA-affiliated Alex Turk Promotions. In his later years, he would promote Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Stu Hart, Bruno Sammartino, Haystacks Calhoun, Lou Thesz and others in the region. In 1961 and 1962, he promoted wrestling events for the American Wrestling Association. In 1963, he left the AWA and ran shows in competition with the AWA for several years. He was eventually pushed out of business by competition from the American Wrestling Association.\n\nTurk's election to the Manitoba legislature was somewhat unexpected. In the 1953 election, he ran as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party in Winnipeg North, a constituency dominated by the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour Progressive Party. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates on the multi-member constituency's first count, behind two other Liberal-Progressive candidates. He did well on transfers, however, and defeated fellow Liberal-Progressive J.M. Kozoriz for the final position. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government.\n\nTurk was on the left wing of the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1954, he was the only member of the government caucus to support a CCF bill calling for comprehensive health insurance. The following year, he was the only Liberal-Progressive MLA to endorse a bill calling for progressive prison reforms.\n\nWinnipeg's multi-member constituencies were eliminated in the 1958 election, and Turk lost to Steve Peters of the CCF by 856 votes in the newly created riding of Elmwood. He ran again in the 1959 election but finished third.\n\nAfter leaving provincial politics, Turk was elected to the Winnipeg City Council. Though a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee, he again showed himself to be a progressive representative on issues relating to workers, pensioners, and people with disabilities, and he often voted with the CCF group. In 1964, he lost his seat on council to another CEC candidate.\n"}

He belonged, like Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, to that \"School of the Middle\" which mediated between realists and nominalists.\n\nBesides his \"Logica\", he wrote \"Consequentiae\", a treatise on the syllogism, and \"Obligationes\" or \"Scholastica militia\", a series of \"formal exercises in scholastic dialectics.\" He had some not unfriendly controversy with his colleague John Wyclif, against whom he defended the possession of wealth by the clergy, and held that in the Church abuses were better than disturbance. He also attacked Wyclif's doctrine of predestination. His positions are gathered from Wyclif's \"Responsiones ad Rodolphum Strodum\" (MS. 3926, Vienna Imperial Library).\n\nChaucer dedicates his poem \"Troilus and Criseyde\" to the contemporary poet John Gower and to Strode:\nModern English translation: \"O moral Gower, I permit this book to you, and to you, philosophical Strode, to correct, away from your benevolence and zealous goodness.\" It is quite possible that Troilus and Criseyde was dedicated to \"philosophical\" (in one of the manuscripts: \"logical\") Strode because the philosopher introduced Chaucer to some of the basic philosophical distinctions between late medieval nominalism and realism. Thus, Chaucer's literary nominalism in his longest complete poem may well be due to his acquaintance with Strode.\n\nAccording to the 15th-century \"Vetus catalogus\" of fellows of Merton, Strode himself was a \"poeta nobilis.\" John Leland and John Bale confirm this, but none of Strode's poems have survived. However, Professor Gollancz suggested that the \"Phantasma Radulphi\" attributed to Strode in the Vetus Catalogus could be the 14th-century elegiac poem \"The Pearl\", but this has found no support from later scholars and, on the basis of the poem's dialect, seems very unlikely.\n\nFrom 1375 to 1385 this Strode or another of the same name was Common Serjeant of London; he died in 1387.\n\n\n"}

She was raised in the town of Buckingham, Quebec, just outside Ottawa. She graduated from Saint Joseph's School of Nursing in Kingston, Ontario, in 1949 and was a nurse in the Ottawa region until 1952. She married civil servant Ken Dewar in 1951 and went into public health with the Victorian Order of Nurses. A devoted Roman Catholic, she would have 5 children, the last in 1963. She later studied nursing science and public health at the University of Ottawa, and was a public health nurse from 1969 to 1971.\n\nDewar became an Ottawa alderman for Britannia Ward in 1972 and was elected Deputy Mayor in 1974, a position she held until 1978. In 1977 she ran unsuccessfully for the Ontario New Democratic Party in the provincial election in the riding of Ottawa West. She was elected mayor in 1978.\n\nShe served as Mayor of Ottawa from 1978 to 1985. As mayor she convened a convention on the issue of homosexuality six months after taking office, in 1978. In 1979, she led Project 4000, in which Ottawa residents sponsored 4,000 Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian refugees. She died in the fall of 2008. Ottawa today still has a large Vietnamese community. In 2005, she appeared on the Vietnamese diaspora music variety show Paris By Night 77 as part of a show commemorating the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. She was interviewed and given a plaque for her support for Vietnamese refugees.\nDewar was a peace activist and campaigner for nuclear disarmament, and, for example, picketed the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa after the invasion of Grenada. She appeared in the 1985 documentary \"Speaking Our Peace\".\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987 Dewar was president of the federal NDP, succeeding Tony Penikett. She was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1987 by-election in the riding of Hamilton Mountain, replacing NDP incumbent Ian Deans. She had been invited to the riding in the hopes that, as a star candidate, she would keep the riding in NDP hands, but she faced strong competition for the nomination from future MP David Christopherson. She was defeated in the 1988 general election, losing to Liberal Beth Phinney by only 73 votes.\n\nContinuing to play a prominent role in the NDP, she was one of the leading backers of Audrey McLaughlin's leadership bid. In the 1993 election Dewar attempted to return to Parliament for the riding of Ottawa Centre, but lost to Liberal incumbent Mac Harb in an election in which the NDP fared poorly across the country.\n\nShe also served as the chair of the Ottawa-Carleton Police Services Board, which oversaw the merger of the Ottawa, Nepean, and Gloucester police forces into a unified organization. However, in December 1995, she and the three other provincially appointed members of the board were fired in mid-term by the new provincial government of Mike Harris who disagreed with their political views. The three Ottawa City Council appointees were not dismissed. Dewar and a fellow board member, Judy Hunter, sued the government for unfair dismissal. In a precedent-setting case the court ruled in their favour, and they won again on appeal.\n\nShe remained politically active throughout, supporting the political career of her son Paul Dewar, who was elected to Parliament in the 2006 federal election, winning the Ottawa Centre riding for the NDP. She also supported Alex Munter in his unsuccessful mayoral candidacy later the same year (2006).\n\nIn addition to her political activities, Dewar did voluntary work for many community organisations, including the Ottawa Women's Credit Union. In 1995 she became chair of Oxfam Canada.\n\nIn 2002 Dewar was made a Member of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour.\n\nOn Friday afternoon September 12, 2008, Dewar was rushed to a Toronto hospital after suffering a serious fall and subsequent brain hemorrhage. She was in Toronto attending the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. Her son Paul Dewar interrupted his 2008 re-election bid to travel and be by her side with other family members, but on September 15 Marion Dewar died. On that day the City of Ottawa lowered civic flags outside Ottawa City Hall in her memory. She would return to Ottawa City Hall for the last time to lie in state in the Jean Pigott Hall until her funeral service on September 19. Among the over 800 people attending the public service were notable politicians including Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty.\n\nOn May 31, 2009 the Ottawa Vietnamese community celebrated the 30th anniversary of Project 4000 with her son and re-elected MP Paul Dewar.\n\nMarion Dewar Plaza, which provided a central site for festivals and special events, is located at 110 Laurier Avenue W., adjacent to the Ottawa City Hall complex.\n\n\n"}

According to Anthony Wood, he was educated at Cambridge and subsequently at Oxford, but did not take a degree and his name is not in university records. He is reputed to have been a brother or near relation of John Stubbs. He married Katherine Emmes (1570/71–1590) in 1586.\n\nHis first work was a broadside of 1581, and London literati came to see him as one of a group of ballad writers including also William Elderton and Thomas Deloney. In 1583 he published his best-known work, \"The Anatomie of Abuses\". It consisted of a virulent attack on the manners, customs, amusements and fashions of the period including the theatre, gambling, alcohol and fashion. It is still read for its full information on the cultural attitudes of the time.\n\nIn 1591 Stubbs published \"A Christal Glass for Christian Women\", for his wife who had died at age 19, of which at least seven editions were called for; it is an example of the \"ars moriendi\" in the Protestant tradition.

As well as his own commercial releases and remixes, he has worked and recorded/remixed for musicians such as Ian Brown, Craig David and Donna Air. Pianoman has had many other guises, the most successful being Bass Boyz which was signed to Polydor and reached number 74 in September 1996 with \"Gunz and Pianos\".\n\nThe name Pianoman was first popularized by the Billy Joel song \"Piano Man\", but this was not the reason for Sammon's use of the name, due to the many records he released during the 1990s (whilst he managed a record shop, and worked on several local Yorkshire pirate radio stations) that were dance music piano anthems, including \"That Whitney Tune\" featuring samples from \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\"; a Bolton record shop owner would call Sammon 'Pianoman' whenever they met. This would lead to the use of that name for his future releases, and become his best known moniker.\n\nAlthough known for the commercial dance sound, he has produced tracks and released vinyl in many dance styles, from drum and bass, garage, 2-step, house and R&B. His first release was \"The Happy Hardcore EP\" billed as DJ Sammon, the name he took to using during his ten-year stint on pirate radio.\n\nIn his twenties, Sammon began on one of Yorkshire's first pirates radio stations, the Bradford based station Paradise City Radio, and worked at several others, including Dream 107.6 FM.\n\nSince 2006, Sammon along with his writing and producing partner Alan Hinton has written, produced and remixed tracks under a variety of aliases covering different genres of dance music including bassline, house, hardcore, Eurodance and funky house. As of 2008, he was signed to Ministry of Sound in the UK under the 2tyme and Service Crew alias, mainly a bassline act and co-writing original material such as \"Missing You\", \"Ain't Your Sweet Thing\", \"So Hot\" and \"Tease Me Please Me\". \nOther names used by Sammon to produce bassline include Hidden Agenda and Serious Business.\n\nAlongside his partner Alan Hinton, they are signed as Phonik to AATW Records with a track called \"Something Special\" featuring Sally Jaxx on vocals.

The problem was solved in the early 1960s when the Royal Canadian Navy's Experimental Squadron 10 (VX 10), based at Shearwater, in collaboration with Dartmouth's Fairey Aviation, developed the world's first HHRSD. The CH-124 Sea King was the first Royal Canadian Navy helicopter to be equipped with this system.\n\nTo use the beartrap, a helicopter hovers over the landing pad on the deck and lowers a line with an attached probe on the end. This probe is attached by the deck crew to a heavier cable that passes through the centre of the beartrap from a winch below the flight deck. The cable is pulled back up and secured to the helicopter. The pilot then increases power to balance the pull of the winch with the lift of the helicopter. This synchronizes the helicopter with the ship's movements and puts the helicopter in the \"high hover\" position. As the pilot decreases the power, the helicopter is slowly pulled by the winch to the \"low hover\" position just above the deck while maintaining sync with the ship. When the landing signals officer (LSO) determines that a relatively quiet moment is approaching, he instructs the pilot to land. The beartrap is then \"closed\" to capture the helicopter's main probe, securing the aircraft to the flight deck. The tail is secured by a second probe.\n\nOnce the helicopter is secured and straightened, the beartrap is used to move the aircraft in and out of the hangar. This allows movement in and out of the hangar in more severe conditions than if aircraft had to be towed in the conventional way.\n\nThe HHRSD was subsequently adopted by navies around the world, including the United States, Australia, and Japan. Other navies use different helicopters aboard different escort ships with a broadly similar system of a probe or grappling device lowered on a steel cable into a flight deck grating, before winching itself down while secured to the deck of a pitching vessel in heavy seas.\n\n"}

Williams was previously chairman and CEO of Twitter, one of the top ten websites on the Internet. He also founded Blogger and Medium, two of the largest and most notable blog distribution websites.\n\nWilliams was born in Clarks, Nebraska, as the third child of Laurie Howe and Monte Williams. He grew up on a farm in Clarks, where he assisted with crop irrigation during the summers. He attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln for a year and a half, where he joined FarmHouse fraternity, leaving to pursue his career.\n\nAfter leaving college, Williams worked at various technology jobs and start-up firms in Florida, at Key West, and in Texas, at Dallas and Austin, before returning to his family farm in Nebraska. In 1996 Williams moved to Sebastopol, California in Sonoma County to work for the technology publishing company O'Reilly Media. He started at O'Reilly in a marketing position, later becoming an independent contractor writing computer code, which led to freelance opportunities with companies including Intel and Hewlett-Packard. While he was working at O'Reilly, he also started a website called EvHead.com, where he first began blogging about his personal thoughts.\n\nEvan Williams and Meg Hourihan co-founded Pyra Labs to make project management software. A note-taking feature spun off as Blogger, one of the first web applications for creating and managing weblogs. Williams coined the term \"blogger\" and was instrumental in the popularization of the term \"blog\". Pyra survived the departure of Hourihan and other employees, and later, was acquired by Google on February 13, 2003.\n\nIn 2003, Williams was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. In 2004, he was named one of \"PC Magazine\"'s \"People of the Year\", along with Hourihan and Paul Bausch, for their work on Blogger.\n\nWilliams officially left Google on October 8, 2004, to co-found Odeo, a podcast company. In late 2006, Williams co-founded Obvious Corporation with Biz Stone and other former Odeo employees, to acquire all previous properties from Odeo's former backers. In April 2007, Odeo was acquired by Sonic Mountain.\n\nAmong Obvious Corporation's projects was Twitter, a popular, free social networking and micro-blogging service. Twitter was spun out as a new company in April 2007, with Williams as co-founder, board member, and investor. In October 2008, Williams became CEO of Twitter, succeeding Jack Dorsey, who became chairman of the board.\n\nBy February 2009, Compete.com ranked Twitter the third most-used social network, based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. As of February 2013, Twitter had 200 million registered users. It gets 300,000 new users a day and, as of August 2015, was ranked twelfth in the world. It receives more than 300 million unique visitors and more than five billion people in traffic a month. 75% of its traffic comes from outside of Twitter.com.\n\nIn October 2010, Williams stepped down from the CEO position, explaining that he would be \"completely focused on product strategy,\" and appointed Dick Costolo as his replacement.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Twitter's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, the company was valued at between US$14 billion and US$20 billion.\n\nOn April 6, 2017, an article announced Williams would sell 30 percent of his stock in Twitter, for \"personal reasons.\"\n\nIn February 2019, Williams stepped down from his role as a board member for Twitter.\n\nOn September 25, 2012, Williams created a publishing platform, Medium (at Medium.com).

He lives in the San Francisco area with his wife, Sara, with whom he has two children. Williams has been quoted as having a philosophy that it is important to conserve time, do fewer things, and to avoid distractions.\n\nAfter President Trump credited his election to the use of Twitter, Evan Williams stated that if true, he was sorry, and he was concerned that the Internet platform rewarded extremes. Williams told the Associated Press that he was wrong to think that an open platform where people could speak freely would make the world a better place.

{"id": "1974089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974089", "title": "ATA over Ethernet", "text": "ATA over Ethernet\n\nATA over Ethernet (AoE) is a network protocol developed by the Brantley Coile Company, designed for simple, high-performance access of block storage devices over Ethernet networks. It is used to build storage area networks (SANs) with low-cost, standard technologies.\n\nAoE runs on layer 2 Ethernet. AoE does not use internet protocol (IP); it cannot be accessed over the Internet or other IP networks. In this regard it is more comparable to Fibre Channel over Ethernet than iSCSI.\n\nWith fewer protocol layers, this approach makes AoE fast and lightweight. It also makes the protocol relatively easy to implement and offers linear scalability with high performance. The AoE specification is 12 pages compared with iSCSI's 257 pages.\n\nAoE has the IEEE assigned EtherType 0x88A2.\n\nSATA (and older PATA) hard drives use the Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) protocol to issue commands, such as read, write, and status. AoE encapsulates those commands inside Ethernet frames and lets them travel over an Ethernet network instead of a SATA or 40-pin ribbon cable. Although internally AoE uses the ATA protocol, it presents the disks as SCSI to the operating system. Also the actual disks can be SCSI or any other kind, AoE is not limited to disks that use the ATA command set. By using an AoE driver, the host operating system is able to access a remote disk as if it were directly attached.\n\nThe encapsulation of ATA provided by AoE is simple and low-level, allowing the translation to happen either at high performance or inside a small, embedded device, or both.\n\nAoE is a layer 2 protocol running at the data-link layer, unlike some other SAN protocols which run on top of layer 3 utilizing IP. While this reduces the significant processing overhead of TCP/IP, this means that routers cannot route AoE data across disparate networks (such as a campus network or the Internet). Instead, AoE packets can only travel within a single local Ethernet storage area network (e.g., a set of computers connected to the same switch or in the same LAN Subnet or VLAN).\n\nThe non-routability of AoE is the only security mechanism (i.e., an intruder can't connect through a router—they must physically plug into the local Ethernet switch where Ethernet frame tunneling over routed networks is not in use). However, there are no AoE-specific mechanisms for password verification or encryption. The protocol provides for AoE targets such as Coraid Storage appliances, vblade and GGAOED to establish access lists (\"masks\") allowing connections only from specific MAC addresses (although these can be spoofed). Most secure AoE by using Ethernet VLANs.\n\nThe AoE protocol provides a mechanism for host-based cooperative locking. When more than one AoE initiator is using an AoE target they must communicate to avoid interfering with one another as they read and write the config string data on the shared AoE device. Without this cooperation file-system corruption and data loss is likely, unless access is strictly read-only or a cluster file system is used.\n\nOne option provided by AoE is to use the storage device itself as the mechanism for determining specific host access. This is the AoE \"config string\" feature. The config string can record who is using the device, as well as other information. If more than one host tries to set the config string simultaneously, only one succeeds. The other host is informed of the conflict.\n\nThe following operating systems provide ATA over Ethernet (AoE) support:\n\nCoraid offered an array of AoE SAN appliances under the EtherDrive brand, along with diskless gateways that add network-attached storage functionality, using the NFS or SMB protocols, to one or more AoE appliances. The Coraid brand is now owned by SouthSuite, Inc., a copy founded by Brantley Coile who founded Coraid.\n\nIn 2007, LayerWalker announced AoE hardware called miniSAN running at both Fast and Gigabit Ethernet. The miniSAN product family offers standard AoE server functions plus other management features that targets PC, consumer and small and medium businesses markets.\nAlthough AoE is a simple network protocol, it opens up a complex realm of storage possibilities. To understand and evaluate these storage scenarios, it helps to be familiar with a few concepts.\n\nA SAN allows the physical hard drive to be removed from the server that uses it, and placed on the network. A SAN interface is similar in principle to non-networked interfaces such as SATA or SCSI. Most users will not use a SAN interface directly. Instead, they will connect to a server that uses a SAN disk instead of a local disk. Direct connection, however, can also be used.\n\nWhen using a SAN network to access storage, there are several potential advantages over a local disk:\n\nTo use a SAN disk, the host must format it with a filesystem. Unlike a SATA or SCSI disk, however, a SAN hard drive may be accessed by multiple machines. This is a source of both danger and opportunity.\n\nTraditional filesystems (such as FAT or ext3) are designed to be accessed by a single host, and will cause unpredictable behavior if accessed by multiple machines. Such filesystems may be used, and AoE provides mechanisms whereby an AoE target can be guarded against simultaneous access (see: Config String).\n\nShared disk file systems allow multiple machines to use a single hard disk safely by coordinating simultaneous access to individual files. These filesystems can be used to allow multiple machines access to the same AoE target without an intermediate server or filesystem (and at higher performance).\n\n\n"}

S. Peirce to express the tendency to regard things such as space, time, and law as continuous:\nHis synechism holds that the essential feature in philosophic speculation is continuity. It denies that all is merely ideas, likewise that all is merely matter, and mind–matter dualism.\n\nThe adjective \"synechological\" is used in the same general sense; \"synechology\" is a theory of continuity or universal causation; \"synechia\" is a term in ophthalmology for a morbid union of parts.\n\nPeirce held that there are three elements or categories throughout experience:\n\nPeirce held that firstness and secondness, as elements, give thirdness and continuity something upon which to operate, and that continuity governs all experience and every element in it.\n\nSynechism is specially directed to the question of hypothesis, and holds that a hypothesis is justifiable only on the ground that it provides an explanation. All understanding of facts consists in generalizing concerning them. Generalization is seen as movement by thought toward continuity. The fact that some things are ultimate may be recognized by the synechist without abandoning his standpoint, since synechism is a normative or regulative principle, not a theory of existence.\n\nIn a contribution to an 1887 symposium \"Science and Immortality\", Peirce had said that the question stood undecided on whether there is immortality or at least \"a future life\", but also that science could come to shed light on the question.\n\nIn an 1893 manuscript \"Immortality in the Light of Synechism,\" Peirce applied his doctrine of synechism to the question of the soul's immortality in order to argue in the affirmative. According to Peirce, synechism flatly denies Parmenides' claim that \"Being is, and non-being is nothing\" and declares instead that \"being is a matter of more or less, so as to merge insensibly into nothing.\" Peirce argued that the view that \"no experiential question can be answered with absolute certainty\" (fallibilism) implies the view that \"the object has an imperfect and qualified existence\" and implies, furthermore, the view that there is no absolute distinction between a phenomenon and its substrate, and among various persons, and between waking and sleeping; one who takes on a role in creation's drama identifies to that extent with creation's author. Carnal consciousness, according to Peirce's synechism, does not cease quickly upon death, and is a small part of a person, for there is also social consciousness: one's spirit really does live on in others; and there is also spiritual consciousness, which we confuse with other things, and in which one is constituted as an eternal truth \"embodied by the universe as a whole\": that eternal truth \"as an archetypal idea can never fail; and in the world to come is destined to a special spiritual embodiment.\" Peirce said in conclusion that synechism is not religion but scientific philosophy, but could come to unify religion and science.\n\nAround 1906, Peirce reaffirmed some of the above forms of immortality, but added, \"If I am in another life it is sure to be most interesting; but I cannot imagine how it is going to be me. At the same time, I really don't know anything about it,\" and that mental action's dependence on the brain was an assumption warranted in science by facts until contrary facts come to light, but from the standpoint of practical interest the dependence remained open to some doubt.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1974109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974109", "title": "Aquitanian language", "text": "Aquitanian language\n\nThe Aquitanian language was spoken on both sides of the western Pyrenees in ancient Aquitaine (approximately between the Pyrenees and the Garonne, in the region later known as Gascony) and in the areas south of the Pyrenees in the valleys of the Basque Country before the Roman conquest. It probably survived in Aquitania until the Early Middle Ages.\n\nArchaeological, toponymical, and historical evidence shows that it was a language or group of languages that represent a precursor of the Basque language. The most important pieces of evidence are a series of votive and funerary texts in Latin which contain about 400 personal names and 70 names of gods.\n\nAquitanian and its related descendant, Basque, are commonly thought to be Pre-Indo-European languages, a remnant of the languages spoken in Western Europe before the arrival of Indo-European speakers. It may be possible to trace the Aquitanians more or less directly back to the Chalcolithic culture of Artenac, but the age of the Aquitanian language, and of the Basque language, is uncertain. Some contend that Basque dates to the age of metal; others, claiming the derivation of words for \"knife\" (\"aizto\"), \"ax\" (\"aizkora\") and \"hoe\" (\"aitzur\") from the word for \"stone\" (\"haitz\"), conclude that the language dates to the Stone Age or Neolithic period, when those tools were made of stone. This derivation, however, has been called into question: see the \"aizkora\" controversy.\n\nAlmost all of the Aquitanian inscriptions that have been found north of the Pyrenees are in the territory that Greek and Roman sources assigned to Aquitanians.\n\n\nSome inscriptions have also been found south of the Pyrenees in the territory that Greek and Roman sources assigned to Vascones:\n\n\nMost Aquitanian onomastic elements are clearly identifiable from a Basque perspective, matching closely the forms reconstructed by the vascologist Koldo (Luis) Mitxelena for Proto-Basque:\n\nThe vascologist Joaquín Gorrochategui, who has written several works on Aquitanian, and Mitxelena have pointed out the similarities of some Iberian onomastic elements with Aquitanian. In particular, Mitxelena spoke about an \"onomastic pool\" from which both Aquitanian and Iberian would have drawn:\n\nFor other more marginal theories see Basque language: Hypotheses on connections with other languages.\n\nSince ancient times there have been indications of a relationship between Southwestern France and the Basques. During the Roman conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, Aquitania was the territory between the Garonne and the Pyrenees. It was inhabited by tribes of horsemen who Caesar said were very distinct in customs and language from the Celts of Gaul. During the Middle Ages, this territory was named \"Gascony\", derived from \"Vasconia\" and cognate with the word \"Basque\".\n\nThere are many clues that indicate that Aquitanian was spoken in the Pyrenees at least as far east as Val d'Aran. Place-names that end in ‑os, ‑osse, ‑ons, ‑ost and ‑oz are considered to be of Aquitanian origin, such as the place-name Biscarrosse, which is directly related to the city of Biscarrués (note the Navarro-Aragonese phonetic change) south of the Pyrenees. \"Biscar\" (modern Basque spelling: \"bizkar\") means \"ridge-line\". Such suffixes in place-names are ubiquitous in the east of Navarre and in Aragon, with the classical medieval ‑os > ‑ues occurring in stressed syllables, pointing to a language continuum on both sides of the Pyrenees. This strong formal element can be traced on either side of the mountain range as far west as an imaginary line roughly stretching from Pamplona to Bayonne (compare Bardos/Bardoze, Ossès/Ortzaize, Briscous/Beskoitze), where it ceases to appear.\n\nOther than place-names and a little written evidence, the picture is not very clear in the west of the Basque Country, as the historical record is scant. The territory was inhabited by the Caristii, Varduli, and Autrigones, and has been claimed as either Basque or Celtic depending on the author, since Indo-European lexical elements have been found underlying or intertwined in the names given to natural features, such as rivers or mountains (Butron, Nervion, Deba/Deva, suffix ‑ika etc.) in an otherwise generally Basque linguistic landscape, or Spanish, especially in Álava.\n\nArchaeological findings in Iruña-Veleia in 2006 were initially claimed as evidence of the antiquity of Basque in the south but were subsequently dismissed as a forgery.\n\nThe Cantabrians are also mentioned as relatives or allies of the Aquitanians: they sent troops to fight on their side against the Romans.\n\nThe Vascones who occupied modern Navarra are usually identified with the Basques (\"Vascos\" in Spanish), their name being one of the most important pieces of evidence. In 1960, a stele with Aquitanian names was found in Lerga, which could reinforce the idea that Basques and Aquitanians were related. The ethnic and linguistic kinship is confirmed by Julio Caro Baroja, who considers the Aquitanian-Basque relationship an ancient and medieval stage ahead of the well-attested territorial shrinking process undergone by the Basque language during the Modern Age.\n\n\n"}

Similarly, a \"lochagos\" normally commands a \"lochos\" (a word that originally meant \"warband\") , which in Ancient Greece was a 100-strong hoplite unit, but in modern Greek usage is equivalent to an infantry company.

{"id": "1974142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974142", "title": "Depletion region", "text": "Depletion region\n\nIn semiconductor physics, the depletion region, also called depletion layer, depletion zone, junction region, space charge region or space charge layer, is an insulating region within a conductive, doped semiconductor material where the mobile charge carriers have been diffused away, or have been forced away by an electric field. The only elements left in the depletion region are ionized donor or acceptor impurities.\n\nThe depletion region is so named because it is formed from a conducting region by removal of all free charge carriers, leaving none to carry a current. Understanding the depletion region is key to explaining modern semiconductor electronics: diodes, bipolar junction transistors, field-effect transistors, and variable capacitance diodes all rely on depletion region phenomena.\n\nA depletion region forms instantaneously across a p–n junction. It is most easily described when the junction is in thermal equilibrium or in a steady state: in both of these cases the properties of the system do not vary in time; they have been called dynamic equilibrium.\n\nElectrons and holes diffuse into regions with lower concentrations of them, much as ink diffuses into water until it is uniformly distributed. By definition, the N-type semiconductor has an excess of free electrons (in the conduction band) compared to the P-type semiconductor, and the P-type has an excess of holes (in the valence band) compared to the N-type. Therefore, when N-doped and P-doped semiconductors are placed together to form a junction, free electrons in the N-side conduction band migrate (diffuse) into the P-side conduction band, and holes in the P-side valence band migrate into the N-side valence band.\n\nFollowing transfer, the diffused electrons come into contact with holes and are eliminated by recombination in the P-side. Likewise, the diffused holes are recombined with free electrons so eliminated in the N-side. The net result is that the diffused electrons and holes are gone. In a N-side region near to the junction interface, free electrons in the conduction band are gone due to (1) the diffusion of electrons to the P-side and (2) recombination of electrons to holes that are diffused from the P-side. Holes in a P-side region near to the interface are also gone by a similar reason. As a result, majority charge carriers (free electrons for the N-type semiconductor, and holes for the P-type semiconductor) are depleted in the region around the junction interface, so this region is called the depletion region or depletion zone. Due to the majority charge carrier diffusion described above, the depletion region is charged; the N-side of it is positively charged and the P-side of it is negatively charged. This creates an electric field that provides a force opposing the charge diffusion. When the electric field is sufficiently strong to cease further diffusion of holes and electrons, the depletion region reached the equilibrium. Integrating the electric field across the depletion region determines what is called the built-in voltage (also called the junction voltage or barrier voltage or contact potential).\n\nPhysically speaking, charge transfer in semiconductor devices is from (1) the charge carrier drift by the electric field and (2) the charge carrier diffusion due to the spatially varying carrier concentration. In the P-side of the depletion region, where holes drift by the electric field with the electrical conductivity \"σ\" and diffuse with the diffusion constant \"D\", the net current density is given by\n\nformula_1,\n\nwhere formula_2 is the electric field, \"e\" is the elementary charge (1.6×10 coulomb), and \"p\" is the hole density (number per unit volume). The electric field makes holes drift along the field direction, and for diffusion holes move in the direction of decreasing concentration, so for holes a negative current results for a positive density gradient. (If the carriers are electrons, the hole density \"p\" is replaced by the electron density \"n\" with negative sign; in some cases, both electrons and holes must be included.) When the two current components balance, as in the p–n junction depletion region at dynamic equilibrium, the current is zero due to the Einstein relation, which relates \"D\" to \"σ\".\n\nForward bias (applying a positive voltage to the P-side with respect to the N-side) narrows the depletion region and lowers the barrier to carrier injection (shown in the figure to the right). In more detail, majority carriers get some energy from the bias field, enabling them to go into the region and neutralize opposite charges. The more bias the more neutralization (or screening of ions in the region) occurs. The carriers can be recombined to the ions but thermal energy immediately makes recombined carriers transition back as Fermi energy is in proximity. When bias is strong enough that the depletion region becomes very thin, the diffusion component of the current (through the junction interface) greatly increases and the drift component decreases. In this case, the net current flows from the P-side to the N-side. The carrier density is large (it varies exponentially with the applied bias voltage), making the junction conductive and allowing a large forward current. The mathematical description of the current is provided by the Shockley diode equation. The low current conducted under reverse bias and the large current under forward bias is an example of rectification.\n\nUnder reverse bias (applying a negative voltage to the P-side with respect to the N-side), the potential drop (i.e., voltage) across the depletion region increases. Essentially, majority carriers are pushed away from the junction, leaving behind more charged ions. Thus the depletion region is widened and its field becomes stronger, which increases the drift component of current (through the junction interface) and decreases the diffusion component. In this case, the net current flows from the N-side to the P-side. The carrier density (mostly, minority carriers) is small and only a very small \"reverse saturation current\" flows.\n\nFrom a full depletion analysis as shown in figure 2, the charge would be approximated with suddenly drop at its limit points which in reality is gradually and explained by Poisson's equation. The amount of flux density would then be\n\nformula_3\n\nwhere formula_4 and formula_5 are the amount of negative and positive charge respectively, formula_6 and formula_7 are the distance for negative and positive charge respectively with zero at the center, formula_8 and formula_9 are the amount of acceptor and donor atoms respectively and formula_10 is the electron charge.\n\nTaking the integral of the flux density formula_11 with respect to distance formula_12 to determine electric field formula_13 (i.e. Gauss's law) creates the second graph as shown in figure 2:\n\nformula_14\n\nwhere formula_15is the permittivity of the substance. Integrating electric field with respect to distance determines the electric potential formula_16. This would also equal to the built in voltage formula_17as shown in Figure 2.\n\nformula_18\n\nThe final equation would then be arranged so that the function of depletion layer width formula_6would be dependent on the electric potential formula_16.\n\nIn summary, formula_6 and formula_7 are the negative and positive depletion layer width respectively with respect to the center, formula_8 and formula_9 are the amount of acceptor and donor atoms respectively, formula_10is the electron charge and formula_17 is the built-in voltage, which is usually the independent variable.\n\nAnother example of a depletion region occurs in the MOS capacitor. It is shown in the figure to the right, for a P-type substrate. Supposing that the semiconductor initially is charge neutral, with the charge due to holes exactly balanced by the negative charge due to acceptor doping impurities. If a positive voltage now is applied to the gate, which is done by introducing positive charge \"Q\" to the gate, then some positively charged holes in the semiconductor nearest the gate are repelled by the positive charge on the gate, and exit the device through the bottom contact. They leave behind a \"depleted\" region that is insulating because no mobile holes remain; only the immobile, negatively charged acceptor impurities. The greater the positive charge placed on the gate, the more positive the applied gate voltage, and the more holes that leave the semiconductor surface, enlarging the depletion region. (In this device there is a limit to how wide the depletion width may become. It is set by the onset of an inversion layer of carriers in a thin layer, or channel, near the surface. The above discussion applies for positive voltages low enough that an inversion layer does not form.)\n\nIf the gate material is polysilicon of opposite type to the bulk semiconductor, then a spontaneous depletion region forms if the gate is electrically shorted to the substrate, in much the same manner as described for the p–n junction above. For more on this, see polysilicon depletion effect.\n\nThe principle of charge neutrality says the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges:\n\nwhere \"n\" and \"p\" are the number of free electrons and holes, and formula_28 and formula_29 are the number of ionized donors and acceptors \"per unit of length\", respectively. In this way, both formula_28 and formula_29 can be viewed as doping spatial densities. If we assume full ionization and that formula_32, then:\n\nwhere formula_34 and formula_35 are depletion widths in the \"p\" and \"n\" semiconductor, respectively. This condition ensures that the net negative acceptor charge exactly balances the net positive donor charge. The total depletion width in this case is the sum formula_36. A full derivation for the depletion width is presented in reference. This derivation is based on solving the Poisson equation in one dimension – the dimension normal to the metallurgical junction. The electric field is zero outside of the depletion width (seen in above figure) and therefore Gauss's law implies that the charge density in each region balance – as shown by the first equation in this sub-section. Treating each region separately and substituting the charge density for each region into the Poisson equation eventually leads to a result for the depletion width. This result for the depletion width is:\n\nformula_37\n\nwhere formula_38 is the relative dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor, formula_39 is the built-in voltage, and formula_16 is the applied bias. The depletion region is not symmetrically split between the n and p regions - it will tend towards the lightly doped side. A more complete analysis would take into account that there are still \"some\" carriers near the edges of the depletion region. This leads to an additional -2kT/q term in the last set of parentheses above.\n\nAs in p–n junctions, the governing principle here is charge neutrality. Let us assume a P-type substrate. If positive charge \"Q\" is placed on the gate, then holes are depleted to a depth \"w\" exposing sufficient negative acceptors to exactly balance the gate charge. Supposing the dopant density to be formula_29 acceptors per unit volume, then charge neutrality requires the depletion width \"w\" to satisfy the relationship:\n\nIf the depletion width becomes wide enough, then electrons appear in a very thin layer at the semiconductor-oxide interface, called an inversion layer because they are oppositely charged to the holes that prevail in a P-type material. When an inversion layer forms, the depletion width ceases to expand with increase in gate charge \"Q\". In this case, neutrality is achieved by attracting more electrons into the inversion layer. In the MOSFET, this inversion layer is referred to as the channel.\n\nAssociated with the depletion layer is an effect known as band bending. This effect occurs because the electric field in the depletion layer varies linearly in space from its (maximum) value formula_43 at the gate to zero at the edge of the depletion width:\n\nwhere \"A\" is the gate area, formula_45 = 8.854×10 F/m, \"F\" is the farad and \"m\" is the meter. This linearly-varying electric field leads to an electrical potential that varies quadratically in space. The energy levels, or energy bands, \"bend\" in response to this potential.\n\n"}

The two founding countries were Canada and the United States. Mr. Ben Weider of Canada served as the first IFBB President. In 1967 the IFBB Mr. Olympia was held, which was the IFBB's first contest. From 1966 to 1970, the Federation experienced rapid growth as Joe and Ben Weider promoted the organization globally. By 1970, the IFBB had directors in more than 50 countries worldwide and the IFBB had its footprint in Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, North America, and South America.\n\nOn September 4, 1970, the IFBB held its 1st International Congress in Belgrade, Yugoslavia where a Constitution was adopted and an Executive Council.

Also In 1971, the IFBB became a member of the General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), now SportAccord. Upon receiving membership, the IFBB became the only official representative of bodybuilding to be recognized by world sport authorities. From the 1980s to his death in 2008, IFBB president Ben Weider petitioned the IOC for inclusion of bodybuilding in the Olympic Games. Although bodybuilding had never been on the Olympic Program, in 1998, the IOC granted the IFBB provisional recognition, which lasted nearly four years, but was withdrawn in 2001.\n\nIn 2004, the IFBB was renamed the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness but retained the \"IFBB\" abbreviation. The following year, the IFBB adopted new IFBB Anti-Doping Rules following the World Anti-Doping Code. The IFBB Professional Section was legally split from the IFBB to form the IFBB Professional League, its own legal entity with its own rules and regulations. In turn, the IFBB Constitution became a governing document for the amateur sport only. In 2006, after 60 years, Ben Weider resigned from his role as president and Dr. Rafael Santonja from Spain was elected as the new president. The IFBB headquarters were moved to Las Rozas (Madrid), Spain. In 2010, Santonja was reelected for a second term, and in 2014, he was reelected for a third time at the IFBB World Congress in Brasilia.\n\nThe IFBB is registered under Spanish law as a nonprofit legal entity.

Welsh has played for the Scotland Under-19 side.\n\nThe left-footed Welsh wrote the club asking for a trial run and made his professional debut for Stockport County in October 2001, going on to make 75 league appearances in his four-year stint at the club. His final match was a 3–0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in League One. He also made six appearances on loan at Macclesfield Town in 2002.\n\nAfter impressing in a three-day trial with Sunderland in November 2004, Welsh signed with the club for £15,000, and could have included a compensation for amount of time on the field stipulation to £35,000. Upon signing for Sunderland he was assigned the vacant number 11 shirt, and made his club debut on 1 January 2005 in a 3–2 defeat to Preston North End, replacing Marcus Stewart in the 68th minute. He score two goals in eight appearances during the 2004–05 season for Sunderland.\n\nWelsh made his first start for Sunderland a week later on 8 January 2005, scoring a free kick in a 2–1 victory against Crystal Palace. Welsh went on to make eight appearances that season, scoring again, against QPR at Loftus Road on 2 April.\n\nAfter Sunderland's promotion to the Premier League, Welsh retained the number 11 shirt, starting the season in place of injured defender George McCartney. However, Welsh was controversially sent off in only the second game of the season against Liverpool at Anfield on 20 August 2005, although the decision was later overturned on appeal.\n\nWelsh found himself out of the Sunderland team after Christmas, and many thought he had played his last game for the club after he was loaned to Championship club Leicester on 1 March 2006. Welsh went on to make ten appearances for Leicester, scoring one goal, helping to stave off relegation for the Foxes.\n\nFour days after playing his last game for Leicester, Welsh was back at Sunderland, playing in the club's last two games, against Fulham and Aston Villa, under new caretaker manager Kevin Ball. Following the transfer of popular midfielder Julio Arca to Middlesbrough in the summer, Welsh was expected to start the season as first choice winger, however injury hit early on in pre-season.\n\nWelsh picked up an injury during a pre-season win against League of Ireland club, Shelbourne, prompting Quinn and new manager Roy Keane to sign Swedish winger Tobias Hysen and Celtic midfielder Ross Wallace to fill the left-midfield role. Welsh subsequently re-joined Leicester on loan when he regained fitness, although he managed only four league starts for them, and returned to Sunderland in the New Year. Coincidentally, Sunderland's next game was against Leicester at the Walkers Stadium, where Welsh was named as an unused substitute.\n\nAfter failing to break back into Sunderland's first team, it was announced in March 2007, that Welsh would be heading to Canada for a medical before signing a contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club, Toronto FC, after the clubs agreed a deal to end his contract at Sunderland.\n\nOn 16 May 2007, Welsh scored his first goal for Toronto in a rain soaked 1–0 home win over defending MLS champions, Houston Dynamo. Fans subsequently voted him \"Man of the Match\" on the club's official website. However, after the first few games Toronto struggled to find points hard to come by, Welsh was in and out of the team and soon decided to return to England.\n\nOn 30 August 2007, it was reported that Welsh would be leaving Toronto for Blackpool, \n\nIn August 2008 Welsh went on trial at Football League One club Yeovil Town. On 3 September, Yeovil manager Russell Slade confirmed that the club had a verbal agreement to sign Welsh with him due to have a medical at the club the following day. Welsh signed a contract with the club until the end of the 2008–09 season. Welsh played 38 games for Yeovil in his first season, he became a bit of a fans favourite when the team went on a 4-game winning streak the team scoring 4 goals direct from his set pieces. He ended the season with Yeovil's most assists on 7 and most crosses on 80, in his 38 appearances.\n\nAt the end of the 2008–09 season, Welsh signed a new two-year deal keeping him at the club until the summer of 2011. In the 2009–10 season Welsh started well and was the divisional top goal maker with 7 assists. However, formation changes saw him slip out of the side a bit, making most of his appearances from the subs bench. However, he was Yeovil's leading creator for the second consecutive season with 10 assists. He also scored his first two goals for the club, in the 2 – 0 win over Brentford and the 4 – 1 win over Wycombe.\n\nWelsh scored in his second game of the season 2010–11 against local rivals Exeter City FC a stunning low volley and then a header against Tranmere Rovers FC two weeks later. Welsh again has been one of Yeovil Town FC outstanding performers this season leading the way in assists again and also scoring some important goals. Welsh recently secured Yeovil's league one status for another season with an 85th-minute equaliser at home to Oldham Athletic the day after his first child was born.\n\nAt the end of the 2010–11 season, he and six other Yeovil players were told they would be re-signed.\n\nOn 1 June 2011, Welsh became Greg Abbott's first signing of the summer when he joined Carlisle United on a two-year deal. It was revealed on 27 May 2013 that Welsh was not going to be offered a new contract and would no longer be a Carlisle United player come the end of the 2012/13 season.\n\nOn 24 June 2013, Andy Welsh become Scunthorpe United's 5th signing of the summer where he has signed a one-year deal for the league two club with an option of a further year.\n\nUnfortunately Welsh after playing every game up until start of October ended up having knee surgery which ruled him out until February 2014.\n\nHaving been part of the squad that won league two that season Welsh' s injury hampered his season and he decided at the end of the season to pursue the remainder of his degree in psychology and coaching.\n\nOn 12 September 2014, Andy Welsh signed for FC United of Manchester. In December 2014, Welsh made the move to Farsley AFC, closer to his home in Bradford.\n\nIn September 2017, Andy Welsh became player/head coach at Ossett Albion.\n\n\nWelsh is a Manchester United supporter.\n\n"}

After signing a professional contract in 2000, he made his first team debut in the League Cup on 9 October 2001, playing the whole of a 6–0 home defeat to Leeds United. After another appearance in a 4–1 league defeat to Liverpool, he was loaned to Mansfield Town, for whom he played 8 times. He impressed there, and scored his first senior goal against Swansea City. On his return in January 2002, Piper played 27 games as Leicester fought relegation from the Premier League. Although Leicester were ultimately relegated with a mere five league wins all season, Piper made his mark in the club's history by scoring the last ever competitive goal at Filbert Street against Tottenham Hotspur as Leicester won 2–1.\n\nSunderland signed Piper from Leicester in August 2002, for a fee of £3,500,000. Despite initially impressing, Piper's time at Sunderland was mostly an unhappy one, suffering a number of serious injuries, resulting in him having 10 operations in 3 years. Piper missed most of the 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons due to injury and rehabilitation.\n\nFollowing Sunderland's promotion to the Premiership in the 2004-05, Piper was included in Sunderland's squad for the pre-season tour of USA and Canada, playing in two friendlies against American opposition. Piper made just one start against Cheltenham Town in the League Cup. This was to be Piper's final appearance for Sunderland, and his contract was terminated by mutual consent in January 2006 following an unsuccessful trial with Coventry City. He had made just 29 appearances, including 15 starts, in three and a half years at Sunderland.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Piper participated in pre-season training at Mansfield Town, in an attempt to rebuild his fitness. However, he decided to retire before the start of the 2007-08 season. In March 2008, he started training with local side Anstey Nomads. He managed just one appearance before retiring from football completely\n\nPiper retired at the age of 26, and has since spoken about his battles with drink and drugs as a result.\n"}

He started his playing career with Queen's Park before moving to Dumbarton. A transfer to English side Sunderland followed in 2004 but he failed to establish himself in the first team during his three-year spell on Wearside. After loan moves to Hartlepool United and Sheffield United he was loaned to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he became a first team regular and signed a permanent deal in 2007. Following Wolves' promotion to the Premier League he fell out of favour and moved on loan again, this time to Preston North End, but although they signed him permanently in 2010, he was never a regular and quickly moved to Leeds United, with whom he won promotion to the Championship in 2010. After losing his place the following season Collins returned to Sheffield United, one of his former loan clubs, for whom he made over 100 appearances. He lost his first team place in the 2014–15 season and joined Port Vale on loan in March 2015. He moved to America in March 2016 to play for the Tampa Bay Rowdies. By the end of his 18-year playing career he had scored 35 goals in 583 league and cup appearances.\n\nHe took his first post in management in May 2018 when he transitioned from player to head coach at the Tampa Bay Rowdies.\n\nCollins was associated with Kilmarnock's youth academy, the team he supported as a boy, before being released at the age of 14. He began his career with Scottish amateur club, Queen's Park, making four appearances in the 2000–01 season as John McCormack's \"Spiders\" were relegated from the Second Division to the Third Division. He played 31 games as Queen's Park finished bottom of the Scottish Football League in 2001–02. During this time he worked at a Safeway supermarket.\n\nCollins earned a move to newly promoted Second Division club Dumbarton in July 2002. During his stay at the Strathclyde Homes Stadium, Collins became popular with the fans and had a spell as captain and was key to Paul Martin's \"Sons\" battle to stay in the Second Division in 2002–03. He then featured 34 times as Dumbarton finished two points outside the promotion places in 2003–04 under Brian Fairley's stewardship. During his time there he had trials with Falkirk, Hibernian, Rangers and Charlton Athletic. During his time in Scotland he also completed a BA 'Sport in the Community' degree at the University of Strathclyde.\n\nCollins was signed by Sunderland manager Mick McCarthy in August 2004 for a fee of £25,000. Three months later he signed a new contract to keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2007. He made 11 appearances during the 2004–05 season as the club won promotion to the Premier League as champions of the Championship.\n\nHe never appeared in the top-flight for the \"Black Cats\" after Alan Stubbs was signed, and was instead loaned out to League One side Hartlepool United in August 2005. He made 25 appearances for Martin Scott's \"Pools\" during his stay at Victoria Park. He was loaned out to Neil Warnock's Championship promotion hopefuls Sheffield United in February 2006. The \"Blades\" succeeded in winning promotion in 2005–06, though Collins featured in just two games at Bramall Lane.\n\nWith Sunderland back in the Championship in 2006–07, Collins was forced to play in the unfamiliar role of right-back after injuries to teammates Stephen Wright and Nyron Nosworthy. He was a regular under Mick McCarthy, but when McCarthy left the job, Collins was dropped by replacement manager Roy Keane despite Collins feeling he'd performed well.\n\nCollins was reunited with his former boss Mick McCarthy at Wolverhampton Wanderers after joining the club on loan in November 2006. The discussion of his loan deal was the first time that Roy Keane and McCarthy had spoken to each other since the Saipan incident in 2002. After his loan expired, he joined Wolves permanently in January 2007 for a fee of £150,000. He was a regular starter for the rest of the 2006–07 season as the club reached the Championship play-offs.\n\nThe 2007–08 season saw Wolves miss out on the play-offs on goal difference with Collins making 42 appearances. Collins started 2008–09 strongly with Wolves but was left out of the first team with the loan arrival of Michael Mancienne from Chelsea. When Mancienne returned to Chelsea in the New Year, Collins returned to the side, partnering Richard Stearman. He contributed several important goals during this period, but was soon ousted from the side again after receiving a red card for dissent at Reading and following the addition of Scottish international Christophe Berra. He remained out of the side for the remainder of the season as the club were promoted to the Premier League as champions, and was transfer listed in July 2009.\n\nIn September 2009, Collins was loaned out to Championship side Preston North End, a move made permanent when he signed a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee in January 2010. The deal was finalised after manager Alan Irvine left the club, and the defender lost his place in the side under new manager Darren Ferguson.\n\nIn March 2010, Collins moved to League One side Leeds United on loan for the rest of the 2009–10 season as a replacement for the injured Patrick Kisnorbo. He played an instrumental part as Leeds were promoted to the Championship after finishing in second place in League One. He signed a three-year deal with Leeds in July 2010 for an undisclosed fee.\n\nHe started the 2010–11 season as one of Leeds' first choice defenders, due to Patrick Kisnorbo still being out with a long term injury. After some indifferent performances early on in the season, Collins scored an own goal in Leeds' 5–2 defeat by Barnsley, and was dropped to the bench by manager Simon Grayson at the end of October.\n\nCollins signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Championship side Sheffield United after being signed by Micky Adams for an undisclosed fee in January 2011. He made his debut in a 3–0 defeat to Ipswich Town at Portman Road on 5 February. He was a regular in defence for the remainder of the 2010–11 season, playing 14 games, but struggled as the team undertook an ultimately unsuccessful battle against relegation; he later said that \"ill discipline was rife at the club on and off the pitch\" and \"I tried to be like Roy of the Rovers and Terry Butcher rolled into one and it didn't go well\".\n\nNow in League One and under the stewardship of Danny Wilson, the 2011–12 campaign saw Collins establish an effective defensive partnership with fellow centre-back Harry Maguire, and he was awarded supporters Player of the Month for September 2011. He scored his first goal for the \"Blades\" in February 2012, in a 1–0 victory over Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town at the Galpharm Stadium. Collins remained a mainstay of the defence but United missed out on automatic promotion by three points to city rivals Sheffield Wednesday, then lost to Huddersfield in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium; the match ended in a 0–0 draw, and though Collins converted his penalty his team lost the shoot-out 8–7.\n\nWith the club still in League One, Collins remained as first choice in central defence alongside Maguire, captaining the side during Michael Doyle's absence. During the first half of the 2012–13 season Collins began to score regularly, netting five times by the start of December as United challenged for automatic promotion. In November he extended his current contract by a further two years until 2015 with the option of another year. His good form was halted when he fractured his cheekbone during a game against Scunthorpe United at the end of December, an injury that ruled him out of action for two months. He made 45 appearances across the campaign as United recorded a club record 21 clean sheets; however they could only reach the play-off semi-finals.\n\nHe scored two goals in 55 appearances in the 2013–14 season and was named on the Football League team of the week after helping United to consecutive 1–0 victories away at Colchester United and Milton Keynes Dons as part of a total run of 450 minutes of League One football that the team went without conceding a goal.\n\nHe lost his place in the United first team early in the 2014–15 season, and dropped out of manager Nigel Clough's first team plans having failed to make an appearance past October. Despite this he vowed to remain at the club, saying he enjoyed a connection with the club. He joined League One rivals Port Vale on loan until the end of the season on 26 March 2015.\n\nFollowing Nigel Clough's departure as manager, Collins was restored to the first team under new boss Nigel Adkins for the 2015–16 season. He was named in the Football League team of the week after scoring a headed goal in a 2–0 victory at Swindon Town, winning praise for his centre-back partnership with David Edgar.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, Collins had his contract with Sheffield United cancelled by mutual consent to allow him to sign a two-year contract with the North American Soccer League's Tampa Bay Rowdies. Head coach Stuart Campbell led the Rowdies to a ninth-place finish in the combined 2016 table. He featured 33 times in the 2017 campaign as the Rowdies finished third in the United Soccer League.\n\nCollins won seven caps at Scotland under-21 level. On 20 November 2007, he played for Scotland B in a 1–1 draw with Republic of Ireland B at the Excelsior Stadium; he came on as a substitute for Darren Dods at half-time.\n\nOn 18 May 2018, Collins was promoted to manager at the Tampa Bay Rowdies after he impressed chairman Bill Edwards with his intensity and work ethic. The Rowdies went on to finish the 2018 season 12th in the USL Eastern Conference table under difficult circumstances, with Collins commenting that “We had players retiring for a variety of reasons, guys getting serious injuries, other off-field problems, it was one thing after another.\" They finished fifth in the 2019 season, before losing 2–1 to Louisville City FC in the Conference quarter-finals.\n\nWriting in \"The Guardian\" in 2007, Steve Claridge compared Collins to Tony Adams, describing him as \"strong and robust\" with good positional and organisation skills. Collins described heading as the strongest part of his game.\n\nSunderland\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nLeeds United\n"}

Kelly, which currently consists of 33 \"chapters\" released from 2005 to 2012. Written and produced by R. Kelly, the series tells a story of a one-night stand which sets off a chain of events, gradually revealing a greater web of lies, sex and deceit. The music follows a distinct E major pattern, and most chapters of the story feature the same melodic theme.\n\nThe first five chapters of \"Trapped in the Closet\" originally appeared as the final tracks on Kelly's album \"TP.3 Reloaded\". R. Kelly wrote and produced all five chapters, and they were recorded by Andy Gallas. The first chapter was released as the lead single from the album in 2005 by Jive Records. Kelly and Jive Records promoted the songs by releasing each of the first five chapters to radio stations one at a time.\nFollowing the success and popularity of the \"Trapped in the Closet\" song series, R. Kelly lip synched a \"new chapter\" at an appearance at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. In November 2005, Jive Records released a DVD titled \"Trapped in the Closet\", which included seven new chapters in addition to the first five from \"TP.3 Reloaded\", bringing the total number of chapters to twelve. The material previewed by Kelly at the MTV Video Music Awards revealed an early version of some parts of the twelfth chapter in the series.\n\nNearly two years later, in August 2007, Kelly and Jive released ten more chapters on another \"Trapped in the Closet\" DVD. These ten chapters were also shown on the Independent Film Channel (IFC) and were also streamed on IFC's website. The release of the DVD brought the series to a total of 22 chapters.\n\nKelly has stated that more chapters would be written and released. In December 2007, the first 22 chapters were released in a DVD entitled \"The Big Package\", which also includes a \"commentary remix\" featuring a preview of chapter 23. On December 21, 2011, Kelly told TMZ that he had written thirty-two more chapters, and was seeking investors in order to continue the saga. IFC announced in October 2012 that it would show new chapters of \"Trapped in the Closet\" on November 23, 2012.\n\nKelly has described the entire series as a \"hip hopera\", saying, \"It's now too long to be called a song.\" When asked about the writing of the song, Kelly stated: \"I don't know how to explain how I wrote it. It just keeps rhyming and rhyming.\" He has also stated that \"Trapped in the Closet\" seems to have taken on \"a life, mind and body of its own\", and has called the series an \"alien\".\n\nEach chapter follows a storyline that continues throughout the series. Kelly voices the role of the song's protagonist, Sylvester, who wakes up after a one-night stand with a woman. As he prepares to leave, however, the woman's husband returns and Sylvester is forced to hide in a closet. This sets off an escalating series of events.\n\nSylvester wakes up in bed with a woman who is not his wife. As he prepares to leave, the woman tells him her husband is coming up the stairs and tells Sylvester to hide in the closet. The couple begins making love when Sylvester's cell phone rings, prompting the husband to investigate. After searching elsewhere, he slowly approaches the closet. Sylvester, prepared for a confrontation, takes out his \"Beretta\" pistol. However, the pistol he reveals is actually a 1911 pistol.\n\nHaving discovered Sylvester in his wife's closet, the husband nearly attacks him but stops because Sylvester is armed. He tells Sylvester that he is a pastor and not prone to violence. When Sylvester tries to leave, the husband tells him to stay because he wants to reveal a \"secret\". He then calls someone he calls \"baby\" and says to \"turn the car around\". Sylvester is anxious about what the husband is about to reveal and becomes threatening, but then someone knocks on the door. The husband opens the door and the person turns out to be another man—revealing the husband (Rufus) to be bisexual.\n\nA shocked and confused Sylvester prepares to leave but the wife asks him to stay. She then argues with her husband, Rufus, over his own infidelity. When Sylvester demands more explanation, the other man, Chuck, begins explaining how their affair came about. Rufus calls his wife Cathy, which shocks Sylvester, who thought her name was Mary. Rufus, Cathy, and Chuck all begin yelling at each other, prompting Sylvester to shoot his gun in the air to quiet them. Sylvester then calls home but is stunned when another man answers the phone. He quickly bolts out of the apartment.\n\nSylvester is seen rushing home, angered and belligerent, but is pulled over by a police officer, who gives him a ticket for speeding. He breaks in his own back door and surprises his wife in the shower only to find her alone. She reminds Sylvester that her brother Twan was coming home that day, and he answered the phone. Sylvester apologizes, and they begin making love. In the middle of it, however, Sylvester's wife, Gwendolyn, discreetly covers something on the bed and then jumps on top of Sylvester and begins to go wild. When Gwendolyn finally climaxes and rolls off him, Sylvester flips the bed cover to find the used condom that she had tried to hide.\n\nThe video for chapter four has since been revised to better match chapter six. The original actor for the officer AKA James, Rondolo Bryce, was changed to current actor, Michael Kenneth Williams. And the line \"I said 'This is some bullshit!', as he gave me the ticket\" was changed to \"He flicks his cigarette and then gives me the ticket.\" And \"He said no except you were doing 85 in 60 miles zone\" Change to \"60 in the 40 miles zone\" and \"I turned my radio on and did 70 all the way home\" changed to \"and did 50 all the way home\"\n\nChapter five starts with Sylvester demanding answers about the condom. They argue, and Gwendolyn retorts with her own knowledge of Sylvester's infidelity, saying she saw Sylvester in the club the night before. He ignores that and demands she name names. She begins talking about friends of hers named Tina and Roxanne and also mentions Chuck and Rufus, which confuses Sylvester. She then explains that she and Cathy were friends in high school, and it was Cathy who introduced Gwendolyn to the police officer that stopped Sylvester, confirming that the police officer was her secret lover.\n\nSylvester and Gwendolyn begin laughing at the entire situation. She admits that the cop she slept with is really the one who answered the phone. And he explains the events of earlier in the morning. Meanwhile, the cop-lover turns his car back around, concerned for Gwendolyn's safety. He sees the back door broken in and mistakes the laughter for abuse and bursts into the bedroom, gun drawn. Sylvester pulls his gun on the cop, whose name is revealed to be James. Gwendolyn pleads with Sylvester, and he puts his gun down. But then James winks and smiles, and Sylvester rushes him. They wrestle over the gun, which inadvertently discharges.\n\nThis chapter reveals it was Twan, Gwendolyn's brother who was just released from prison, who was the one who was shot. After realizing who it was, Sylvester and James argue at who was at fault with the shooting, with Sylvester blaming the entire incident on the cop. Twan is presumed to be dead, but in the middle of Sylvester, James and Gwendolyn arguing, Twan coughs, assuring them he is okay and that he was only non-fatally shot in the shoulder. As Twan recovers in the bathroom, Sylvester begins telling him what caused the incident when someone knocks on the door. After being hesitant with answering the door, Sylvester grabs his gun and aims it at the door, Twan joins him, snatching James' gun. At the count of three, Twan opens the door and it is revealed to be the next door neighbor, Rosie, who is shown with a spatula in her hand. A relieved Sylvester and Gwendolyn invite Rosie in while James snatches his gun back from a bewildered Twan's hands and leaves.\n\nIn this chapter, a tired and frustrated James drives back to his house and calls up his wife Bridget (Kelly sings all of Bridget's lines with a Southern accent). James tells a concerned Bridget that he was heading home, to which Bridget happily tells him she had baked him a cherry pie. Meanwhile, at Sylvester's house, Rosie, the next door neighbor, tells Sylvester, Twan and Gwendolyn that she could not stand the cop that just left their house causing Gwendolyn, Sylvester and Twan to laugh. Back at James' house, he pulls up to the garage. A panicked Bridget rushes to the door and kisses James. When James asks her why she looked jittery, Bridget excuses it as \"might be that time of the month\". The \"might be\" makes James suspicious. Bridget laughs it off, saying \"you know what I mean\". Bridget tries getting him upstairs, or enticing him with fresh pears, but James insists on heating some leftover chicken. Bridget's nervous breakdown finally leads to James demanding a straight answer from Bridget. James then starts to wonder if Bridget had also cheated on him. Unbeknownst to him and from the looks of a nervous Bridget, it becomes clear another man is still in the house.\n\nJames starts investigating his house for any possible intruders. When he hears a noise, he begins to search all over the kitchen while a panicked Bridget stands over by the dishes. After James checks the oven and looks behind the fridge, he notices the cherry pie with a slice cut out. When he realizes that Bridget is allergic to cherries, he turns to her and moves slowly to a scared Bridget. After demanding Bridget to move from her spot, which she eventually does, he sees the cabinet and slowly approaches it. Just as he opens it, the video suddenly stops and the narrator exits out of the kitchen pantry and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience that the man, hiding in the cabinet, is a midget.\n\nIn this chapter, the midget jumps out of the cabinet and fights with James. After James' constant roughing up on the midget, Bridget runs upstairs where she pulls out a number from her purse. Meanwhile, back downstairs, James puts the midget on the table and demands to know why he was at his house. The midget continues telling him that he was paid not to tell, which only angers James, who pulls his gun on him. When he does, the midget defecates. Back at Sylvester's house, he, Twan and Gwendolyn are playing cards when the phone rings. When Gwendolyn answers it, she hears a panicked Bridget, who tells her she found her number in James' pocket. After a minute, Gwendolyn hangs up and gives Sylvester and Twan the address to the house, presumably to stop the fight. Back at James' house, James and the midget continue fighting until Bridget comes back to the kitchen with a double-barreled shotgun. When James points his gun at Bridget, the midget takes his inhaler out. A few seconds later, Sylvester and Twan burst through the door and Sylvester points his gun at James. Sylvester and Twan notice a peculiar odor in the house. Due to Sylvester and Twan's entrance, the midget faints on the table.\n\nIn this chapter, the midget wakes up peculiar to seeing three guns and tries to get out of the situation. Sylvester then begs Bridget and James to put their guns down, to which they adamantly refuse. Bridget then tells Sylvester she will drop the gun if James does not hurt the midget, whose name is revealed as \"Big Man\", a stripper at a club called Dixie's. When Sylvester asks why he was named that, the midget points down to his pants and tell him he is \"blessed\". After seeing Sylvester and Big Man communicating, James shuts them up calling them \"Chuck and Rufus\", which confuses Sylvester, who demands to know how James knew of them, though James acts bewildered to Sylvester's question. Just as James looks as if he was going to answer, Bridget starts getting sick. It is then revealed that Bridget is three months pregnant, presumably with James' baby. After James' constant prompts to Sylvester, Twan and Big Man with his gun to leave, Bridget stops him and admits paying Big Man and even admitted that she knew that James had been cheating on her with Gwendolyn, saying that she had followed him around. When James demands to know what Bridget is really telling him, Bridget says that Big Man is her baby's father, which negates her previous excuse from chapter 8 as being \"that time of the month\". Big Man again faints at the news.\n\nKelly switches from first person (as Sylvester) to third person narrative in the middle of this chapter as the focus fades away from his character.\n\n\nBack at Cathy's house, she, Rufus and Chuck get up from the floor. After Cathy closes the door, she and Rufus argue about the reasons why Sylvester almost shot at them in Chapter 3, with Cathy angered about Rufus \"creeping\" around with Chuck, who is the deacon of Rufus' church, telling him \"ain't no telling what I've got\", referring to sexually transmitted diseases. Chuck gets angry at this and threatens Cathy with a knife, which prompts Cathy to force him to do it. Rufus then calms them down and tries to resolve the matter but neither Cathy or Chuck listen, as they continue arguing, even as the phone rings. When it rings a second time, Cathy answers it and it is Gwendolyn and she begins telling Cathy about the drama that had gone on. When Gwendolyn mentions that she saw Sylvester in Paje's club with \"some crusty wig-wearing ass ho\", Cathy realizes the man she had slept with that night was Sylvester. When Cathy tries telling her who the \"ho\" was, Gwendolyn stops her and tells her more about James and his situation. When an angry Rufus demands Cathy to finish their conversation, Cathy shuts Gwendolyn up and tells her she was the \"ho\" that had been with Sylvester.\n\nIn the original version of Chapter 12 (which was originally going to be Chapter 6), Rufus said he was going to take back Cathy. This idea was later incorporated into the later chapters. Also, Gwen never called Cathy so Gwen would've never known Cathy was the one that slept with Sylvester.\n\nThe chapter initially starts with Sylvester and Twan in Sylvester's car though it is not clear at first where they are going. When Sylvester tells Twan to be on his best behavior and reminds Twan about how he got sent to jail, Twan says it \"was because of Roxanne and that bitch Tina\", which Sylvester remembers his wife mentioning their names in chapter five. The scene soon cuts to Rosie the nosy neighbor and her husband Randolph (played by R. Kelly), who argue over Rosie spying on other neighbors. The argument ends when the scene cuts back to Sylvester explaining to Twan that he has to collect money from someone, he tells Twan to leave the car in drive and be on the lookout and enters a restaurant. An hour goes by with no sign of Sylvester.\n\nIn chapter fourteen, it is revealed that apparently Sylvester and Cathy, who shows up in a blond wig and black dress, made a deal for Sylvester to get caught by her pastor husband Rufus but the deal had apparently backfired, not only by Cathy's realization that Sylvester and her best friend Gwendolyn were married but also due to Cathy not wanting to end her marriage to Rufus, with Cathy later admitting she had changed her mind on the deal. When Sylvester threatens to leave, Cathy tries to explain the reasons why. A waitress comes by and offers them drinks. Sylvester looks at the waitress thinking to himself that she looked familiar. Meanwhile, outside at Sylvester's car, Twan gets a call from a friend (only shown by a close up of his mouth) about Tina, telling him Tina had stopped being a prostitute and was working at a \"legit\" place. He later tells Twan that Tina was working at the same restaurant as Sylvester with Cathy. Back at the restaurant, Sylvester notices the waitress but can't think from where, until he sees her name tag which says \"Tina\". Sylvester then says he wants to talk to her but she gets scared and calls for her friend/co-worker Roxanne, who runs out with a frying pan. After Tina breaks a beer bottle and makes karate-styled moves saying to Sylvester that she and Roxanne take Tae Bo, Cathy and the rest of the patrons leave quickly, leaving Sylvester alone with Tina and Roxanne. Just as Tina and Roxanne are about to attack, Twan comes busting through the door threatening them.\n\n\nWith Twan, Sylvester, Tina and Roxanne in the now-empty restaurant, Twan seeks revenge on Tina and Roxanne on his arrest three years ago. Sylvester tries calming Twan down reminding him he's on house arrest and that a violent outburst would lead to a more serious time in prison. After convincing Twan to let him talk to them, Sylvester approaches the two ladies and ask them what had happened on the day of his arrest. Tina and Roxanne explain that they were on a \"simple operation\" describing a \"trip\" to Atlanta. Roxanne tells Sylvester that a high Twan was swerving on the road and cutting up on the both of them, even turning his music loud playing \"Mary Jane\" and screaming \"I'm Rick James, bitch!\" Tina explains that as soon as that happened, they heard not only police squad cars but also a helicopter. Twan's car breaks down and all three are eventually arrested. In the interrogation room, the police tell the women that Twan blamed the drug deal on them in order to save his own skin. It is then when Roxanne tells Twan she turned him in. Roxanne says Tina protected him because Tina was pregnant with Twan's baby at the time.\n\nIndie folk musician Will Oldham makes a cameo in this chapter as one of the police officers in the interrogation.\n\nSylvester, stunned at first at the news of Tina having Twan's child, congratulates Twan on the news but Twan is not convinced, accusing Tina of lying to him. This makes Tina's eye twitch, which had started when Sylvester had first approached her near the end of chapter 14. When Sylvester asks Roxanne about it, Roxanne explains a pimp had hit Tina in the eye a year ago and that she's had bad nerves ever since. Twan then pulls Sylvester to the side and begins wondering if he is really the father of Tina's child. Sylvester convinces him that a child would calm him down. When Twan tells Tina that he wants to make this work, Roxanne kisses Tina and reveals they are lovers.\n\nIn the commentary remix on the \"Trapped in the Closet\" DVD, Kelly tells the audience that in the upcoming chapters he will probably give Tina about three chapters to explain her nervous eye twitch.\n\nStunned at the news of Roxanne and Tina being lovers, a frustrated Sylvester points his gun at the both of them, but soon stops because of his tolerance to lesbians, while Twan kept egging him to shoot them. Sylvester tries to get Twan to leave the restaurant. It's only after Twan threatens Tina and Roxanne that he will buy a gun and come back for them later that Sylvester finally convinces Twan to leave.\n\nBack at the car as they drive away, Twan is still angry over seeing Roxanne and Tina together, despite Sylvester's efforts to calm him down. Around this time, Sylvester gets a phone call from Gwendolyn, who tells him that his parents, O'Dale and Myrna, got into it and Myrna had O'Dale put in jail. The scene then shifts to Rufus' church where he is leading the worship song, \"Jesus Will Work It Out\", with Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir. When the song reaches a climax, Rufus gets a phone call and excuses himself to his office. It's Chuck, who's crying and upset over not seeing Rufus since the incident in the earlier chapters. Rufus and Chuck argue when Cathy walks in Rufus' office. When Cathy asks Rufus who was on the phone, Chuck, who can be heard accidentally on speaker phone, cries out for Rufus, which angers Cathy and the two argue before Rufus sends Cathy out to deal with the situation. Rufus then tries to let Chuck come see him so they can talk but Chuck refuses. Rufus then tells Chuck that he wants to stay married because he loves his wife and is a Pastor as the reason he doesn't want to see Chuck anymore. This angers Chuck, who threatens to reveal their relationship. When Rufus again tries to get Chuck to come see him, Chuck reveals he is recovering at a hospital.\n\nReverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir attempt to persuade Pimp Lucius, a pimp with a severe stuttering problem, to stop pimping and to turn his life around. As the choir sings \"you can do it Pimp Lucius,\" Lucius pretends to accept the offer and leaves the church. However, he then tells his pimpin' partner, Bishop Craig, that he is never going to \"s-s-s-s-s-stop p-p-p-pimpin,\" because \"p-p-p-pimpin's for life.\" Then he tells Bishop Craig \"now let's get this mmm-mmmm money.\"\n\nThis chapter shows Rosie the Nosy Neighbor's house where Rosie is seen in her chair reading the Bible when her husband Randolph comes in shouting, \"he's got the package!\" to Rosie. Unwilling to listen to reason, when Randolph tells her he has news on the pastor (Rufus), she demands to know what was going on with him. After some bickering, Randolph tells Rosie the story: while working as a janitor for the church, Randolph hears Rufus coming into the office. Randolph hid in the closet and unintentionally overheard the conversation seen in chapter eighteen among Chuck, Rufus and Cathy. After relaying the story, Rosie asks Randolph why he had said the pastor had \"the package\", Randolph says that Chuck told him he was at the hospital. Rosie immediately decides to inform the masses, despite Randolph's protests. The chapter ends with Randolph sitting on the couch, falling asleep.\n\nSylvester and Twan go to visit an apparent mobster named Joey. Sylvester informs Joey of some job that could get them a lot of money. While there, Joey accuses Twan of being a cop, as well as calling him \"LL Fool J,\" deeply offending Twan. Sylvester, trying to defuse the situation, asks Twan to wait outside the office while he and Joey discuss business. As Twan leaves the room, he remarks, \"I'll be listening from the outside.\" Joey replies, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Mama said knock you out, fuck outta here.\" While waiting outside, Twan has a nightmare of Sylvester and him in the same situation, being pointed at with guns. In the end, Sylvester wakes Twan up, then Joey and Sylvester say their goodbyes, and Joey asks Sylvester to tell Gwendolyn he says hello, as their deal is sealed.\n\n\nThe scene opens to O'Dale and Myrna's voicemail and eventually fades into the middle of the voicemail box where the narrator (Kelly) says, \"and now the rumor.\" Throughout a series of phone conversations among all of the original characters from Chapters 1–12 and those introduced in Chapter 13–22, rumors of \"The Package\" circulate. Because Chuck has it, it has possibly been passed to Rufus, to his wife Cathy, to Sylvester, and to Gwendolyn. In addition, Bridget realizes that James knows both Chuck and Rufus, though he tried to hide it from her earlier, suggesting he may be on the \"down-low\" with Chuck as well. Gwendolyn also cheated on Sylvester with James. However, she used a condom as revealed in Chapter 4. This would put Bridget, Big Man, and James at serious risk. Lastly, Pimp Lucius gets a similar concerned call from an unidentified woman (who may have gotten \"The Package\" from Big Man, and subsequently passed it to Pimp Lucius).\n\nThis chapter starts off with Sylvester and Gwendolyn watching TV and getting a mysterious phone call. Then it goes over to Cathy and Rufus, who decided to go shopping downtown. Cathy's phone rings and she exclaims its those people again. Rufus tells her to hang up. Bridgette, Twan and most of the rest of the cast also get a mysterious phone call, proffering money in exchange for an unknown service.\n\nThe chapter starts off with Twan winning a bet during a sports game at the local barber shop. Meanwhile, outside, Pimp Lucius is yelling at his prostitutes over a lack of money that's been coming in. He then states if he doesn't get his money soon he'll start hitting the girls, and it is revealed that he is responsible for Tina's nervous twitch. Sylvester and Twan come outside where after a comical encounter with Lucius, they attempt to walk away ending the chapter.\n\nThe chapter begins directly after the previous as Pimp Lucius calls Sylvester over to ask him for a couple of \"racks\". He then says that he'll pay Sylvester back on the first chance he gets. Sylvester tells Lucius he needs to go and see his parents, and then Sylvester and Twan depart from the scene, frustrating Lucius more.\n\nThis chapter contains Cathy's confessional for Out of the Closet with Larry and her ultimatum for her husband, Rufus.\nThe chapter switches to a pan on the door of Doctor William T. Perry, a marriage counselor. The doctor is getting off the phone as Rufus and an impatient Cathy walk into the room. Rufus is at first reluctant and asks the doctor not to record their session. Cathy then breaks down and begins to cry over the fact that Rufus loves a man over her. Rufus then pronounces that he is confused and still loves Chuck.\n\nThis chapter begins with Rufus getting on his knees and praying to God to change his ways. Meanwhile, Doctor Perry tries to convince Cathy to go back inside the room and console Rufus as well as make amends. He details a past couple that had a relationship that he was upset never got fixed, and pleads for Cathy to not do that to her own relationship. Back in the office, Rufus calls out to God asking how God was going to help him. Just as he does this, Cathy comes back in the room and forgives Rufus—saying she's willing to work it out.\n\nThe chapter then switches over to Rufus' confessional. Rufus was tricked into coming on the show by the staff; he believed he was there to talk about the church and the community but he is bombarded by questions about his personal life. After an insinuation by an off-screen director, he leaves the set.\n\nRosie and Randolph are the central plot for this chapter. Randolph can't sleep and wakes Rosie up, and asks if she meant it when she called him Mr. Can't-Get-It-Up in Chapter 13. She tries to leave the conversation but Randolph begins dancing around, taunting her and saying he's going to take off his pajamas and flash her. The doorbell rings, interrupting their shenanigans, and Randolph goes to answer the door. The scene switches to Rosie in her confessional, she calls Randolph 89 and insinuates that he has a tiny penis. Then it goes to Randolph's confessional. He attempts to defend himself from Rosie's insinuations; she comes on the set and two begin to fight comically. The off-screen director is yelling for them to stop, but they only continue.\n\nThe chapter starts off with Reverend Mosley James Evans in an advertisement about his new book, \"Trapped in the Closet\". He dances around and compares his book to the Bible. The scene changes to Roxanne talking about the Preacher to Tina and saying that the man is a con artist. Tina tells Roxanne not to say those things about the Reverend. A fight ensues and Tina ends up dumping Roxanne and saying she's going to go find Twan. The chapter then goes to Tina's confessional where she says she appreciated Roxanne for taking her in but she says it's time for her to find her own identity. She also states she will be coming onto the \"Out of the Closet\" show. The scene then switches to Roxanne's confessional, where she talks about how ungrateful Tina is being and that the argument isn't over.\n\nThis chapter starts off with Sylvester and Twan in a private garage going over their plans for a future meeting with an unknown gangster. Twan lifts his shirt up and shows Sylvester that he bought a gun, Sylvester takes it from him until after the deal. Sylvester warns him one more time about the delirious mobster they're about to meet. The two of them then get into the car. The chapter then switches the simultaneous confessional of both Sylvester and Twan. Twan starts off by saying that Sylvester never lets him have fun. Sylvester then informs the viewers that Twan likes to talk a lot but can't really back it up. He then informs him that true thugs move in silence. After a comical dialogue, the chapter ends with them laughing.\n\nThe chapter involves Pimp Lucius going home to see his parents, who turn out to be Randolph and Rosy. Randolph is at first angry and doesn't want to let Lucius in but Rosy insists he come in. Rosy gets mad at Randolph and calls him by his middle name, Douglas. The chapter continues with Lucius explaining the mysterious phone calls he's getting and his need for money and a place to sleep. It ends with Randolph answering the door again to find Lucius' prostitutes whom he compares to En Vogue.\n\nPimp Lucius chews out his prostitutes in this chapter trying to find out why they didn't stay in the car while he talked to his parents. The girls say the blind prostitute got worried and asked them to go up to the door to find out if Lucius was okay. Pimp Lucius doesn't believe them and sends them back to the car. Lucius then reflects as the girls walk away. The chapter then goes over to the dramatic confessional of Pimp Lucius alongside his four prostitutes. He talks about his father denying him of money and a place to sleep. He wonders why his father could have done something like this to him, considering the fact that he is family.\n\nThis chapter involves Sylvester and Twan meeting up with the mobster, Beeno. The conclusion of Part 3 begins with the character Bankhead opening the door, at first reluctant to let the men in. He warns and threatens them and then guides the men to Beeno. Beeno is eating sunflower seeds aggressively and listens to Sylvester as he makes his proposal. Something seems to be bothering Beeno's throat and he reveals that Joey shot him in the neck during a past deal. Beeno doesn't much care for Sylvester's humor and tells his men to kill them after revealing that he is aware of Sylvester making deals with the Italians. Twan saves the day and takes Bankhead's gun and the two flee. Then the melody changes to an upbeat one, as Bankhead and his crew chase Sylvester and Twan. The two men run and end up hiding behind a garbage bin. After assuring that they weren't followed, Sylvester reveals to Twan that they're standing outside of the back entrance to the show that the cast has been doing confessionals for, \"Out of the Closet with Larry\". The two men walk inside and the chapter ends as the show is about to begin.\n\n\n\n\nThe first chapter of \"Trapped in the Closet\" was ranked by VH1 as the #41 best song of the 2000s.\n\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" has inspired numerous parodies and derivatives.\n\n\nRoger Cormier wrote that \"when journalists write about...\"Trapped in the Closet\", they tend to throw out a high-brow literary reference,\" but then described it as \"a subtlety free, it's-so-dumb-it's-brilliant work of art\" comparable to \"Laurence Sterne's 18th-century novel \"The Life and Opinions of Tristam Shandy, Gentleman\" \".\n\nHillary Brown linked \"Trapped in the Closet\" to the Renaissance concept of sprezzatura and compared it to the work of Stendhal and John Ashbery.\n\nJohn Lichman warns \"once you start watching 'Trapped in the Closet,' whether out of curiosity or because you think it's a joke, you will find yourself sucked down a hole into something more obsession-friendly than 'Arrested Development' when it comes to jokes, plot twists and fan-service.\"\n\nChuck Klosterman calls it a cult classic and wrote: \"Describing \"Trapped In The Closet\" to anyone who hasn't seen it themselves is virtually impossible, simply because there's no other art to compare it with (it falls somewhere between a parody of musical theatre, a soap opera from the late 1970s, and a BET version of the Red Shoe Diaries).\" \n\nPitchfork writes \"If you haven't seen \"Trapped in the Closet\" before... stop what you're doing and watch all of it right now. It is truly mind-blowing.\" \n\nThe first 22 chapters of the \"Trapped in the Closet\" series have been released via VEVO and can be viewed for free as the videos are ad-supported. As of May 2012, the series averages 7,000,000 views for the first 22 chapters on the website itself, and also an average of 7,000,000 views on Kelly's VEVO YouTube page. However, chapters 3, 5, 6, and 13 are cut short.\n\nR. Kelly stated in an interview with Rap-Up TV that he was, at the time, working on a movie version of \"Trapped in the Closet\" that would have been released to theaters. The movie was rumored to be called \"Trapped in the Closet: The Movie\".\n\nTrapped in the Closet: The Book is a yet-to-be-released book by Robert Kelly, also the creator of the hip hopera of the same name. \"The Book\" was set to be released sometime in 2018 alongside the Broadway debut of \"Trapped in the Closet\", however neither of these projects were released to the public. The book is about what happened before the characters actually meet in the musical. The book has been shown in the latest chapters of the show in 2012, \"\".\n\nR. Kelly dubbed it \"the prequel meeting the sequel\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1974193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974193", "title": "Duty Now for the Future", "text": "Duty Now for the Future\n\nDuty Now for the Future is the second studio album by American rock band Devo, released in July 1979 by Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Ken Scott, the album was recorded between September 1978 and early 1979 at Chateau Recorders in Hollywood. The majority of the songs on the album had been performed in Devo's live set as early as 1976.\n\nThe \"Devo Corporate Anthem\" song and video are a nod to the 1975 film \"Rollerball\", in which games are preceded by players and audience standing solemnly while listening to a regional \"corporate hymn.\" \"Secret Agent Man\" is a cover (with modified lyrics) of the song by P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri and performed by Johnny Rivers in 1965. An early demo version of \"Secret Agent Man\" had been featured in Devo's award-winning 1976 short film \"The Truth About De-Evolution\".\n\n\"Duty Now for the Future\" was produced by Ken Scott. Like Brian Eno, who had produced Devo's debut album \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\", Scott had also worked with David Bowie, most notably on the records \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" and its follow-up, \"Aladdin Sane\". Scott heaped praise on the band, claiming they were \"quite professional in the studio\" and that he \"loved every minute of it.\"\n\nScott discussed his role in the recordings and how Devo came to choose him for the album: \"I consider my job to put the act across in the best way possible, in the way THEY wish to be perceived. I hate it when I'm part of the final equation. The act was signed for their talent not mine. I just wish the modern A&R people saw things that way. I know they chose me because of the Bowie records I did, but I don't know if it was a direct recommendation from Mr. Jones. Devo always wanted to learn. That's why they worked with each producer only once. Took what they needed and then time to move on.\"\n\nOne prominent aspect of \"Duty Now for the Future\" is in the manipulated sound of the guitars. According to Scott, to record the solo for \"Secret Agent Man,\" \"We overloaded mic amps and fed the signal through headphones which were taped to the mic.\"\n\nDevo bass guitarist and co-songwriter Gerald Casale corroborated this approach in an interview with BAM magazine in 1979. \"A guitar can only do what a guitar does. It's like only one tiny piece of a synthesizer. On this album, we did much more with\nthe guitars, too. Sometimes you don't know that they're guitars.\"\n\nHowever, more recently, Casale has been critical of the sound of the album, particularly in a Reddit chat on June 25, 2013: \"I love the songs but I loathe Ken Scott's production. He 'de-balled' us.\"\n\nThe American 12\" album cover was jokingly dominated by the album’s Universal Product Code. The colorful Janet Perr artwork satirized the new requirements for these bar codes. Until that time, album covers were seen as an entire art form unto themselves. Consequently, the new mandates for UPCs splashed across every work of album art were a subject of much protest as an infringement upon artistic integrity and an Orwellian symbol of the impersonal modern age.\n\nThe photograph of the band was taken by photographer Allan Tannenbaum for the Soho Weekly News in New York City. It was used in the album artwork by simply taking it from the front page of the newspaper in the exact same dimensions, unbeknownst to the photographer. When he discovered this, he contacted the record company and was paid for the use.\n\nThe rectangular image of the band originally came perforated and could therefore be removed from the \"offending\" barcodes surrounding it.\n\nThe inner sleeve included the lyrics of all the songs printed in a single block of closely printed text. In addition to other artwork, the sleeve also featured a West Hollywood address from which one could request information and news about the band. In addition, an address was included to allow purchasers to order a copy of the 'Devo-vision\" videocassette from Time Life. This tape was never actually made available from Time Life and was a few years later issued under the title \"The Men Who Make the Music\" via Warner Home Video.\n\nDevo produced one music video for this album. \"The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize\" combined animation with blue screen effects of the band performing. In this video, Devo chiefly wore white shirts and pants and silver 3D glasses. Also of note is the appearance of Alex Mothersbaugh, the daughter of guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh. Alex would later be featured on the back cover of Devo's 1984 album, \"Shout\".\n\nA short clip of the band standing at attention and then saluting was filmed to accompany \"Devo Corporate Anthem\" and was used in concert performance.\n\n\"Duty Now for the Future\" was on the \"Billboard\" charts for 10 weeks, peaking at No. 73. It was received less enthusiastically than their first release, \"Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!\". Dave Marsh, writing in \"Rolling Stone\", condemns it completely, feeling that \"inspired amateurism works only when the players aspire to something better.\" In their review of the album, \"Smash Hits\" described it as \"unimpressive\", but noted that the \"change of style definitely grows on you\". They went on to say that, although the album was more accessible, it was \"lacking the zany magic of old\".\n\nThe AllMusic review, written more than a decade later, takes a longer view. Reviewer Mark Deming writes that \"their second album captures the group in the midst of a significant stylistic shift\" while acknowledging that the song \"'Triumph of the Will' embraces fascism as a satirical target without bothering to make it sound as if they disapprove.\" KROQ-FM/LA long-time disc jockey Jed the Fish, admittedly a huge fan of Devo, sees the album as playing \"catch-up,\" fleshing out many more songs from their immense volume of demo recordings.\n\nA seminal new wave synthpop album, \"Duty Now for the Future\" was eventually heralded as one of the first pop/rock or AOR releases of a major record label to rely heavily on synthesizers, which went on to be widely used in the subsequent new wave genre of the 1980s. As an offshoot of punk rock, new wave music had consisted primarily of guitar-based songs derived from traditional rock and roll and blues scales and riffs, as represented by Devo's punk contemporaries the Sex Pistols, Ramones and the Clash.\n\nPunk rock musician Henry Rollins is among the many musicians that praise the album's innovations. Rollins' short-lived Infinite Zero reissue label (an offshoot of American Recordings) was responsible for the first U.S. CD release of \"Duty Now for the Future\" in 1994.

There were five series of the drama, shown on BBC One. The first two were composed of individual stories. Series three, four and five were each single stories composed over multiple episodes. Colin Bateman adapted the pilot for a novel.\n\nA sixth series has not been commissioned. In a 2008 interview, Nesbitt attributed this to the fifth series' ratings being damaged after it was scheduled opposite ITV's popular drama \"Doc Martin\".\n\nAll 23 episodes have since been released on DVD. All episodes from series two onwards were released as edited 50-minute masters instead of the 60-minute versions that were broadcast, except series 3 which was released uncut in the US. The first, second and third series were all released on 28 August 2006. The fourth and fifth series were released in a joint box-set on 15 October 2007.\n\nDetective Sergeant Tommy Murphy (James Nesbitt) is an uncompromising, sometimes tough talking cop. He has no issues with using his charm and sense of humour to attempt to impress any woman, especially Annie, his colleague and later boss. Murphy was previously married with a young daughter, in Northern Ireland. There, his family were taken hostage and he was forced to make a choice; either carry a bomb and blow himself up in a local barracks, or have his daughter killed.\n\nHe originally chose the first option but when he got to the barracks he couldn't go through with detonating a bomb that would kill a hundred people. When he got back to the house, he found that they had slit his daughter's throat and that his wife had been forced to watch. His decision affected almost everything he does in life. He reflects at intervals, and remarks that he received 'a nice medal' for 'saving' so many lives, by making such a sacrifice. Yet, he still feels responsible for his daughter's death.\n\n\n"}

S. Eliot's 1939 poetry book \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\". The Jellicle cat duo are mischievous petty thieves who often cause trouble for their human family. Although originally published as part of a collection, the poem \"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\" was published as a standalone book by Faber and Faber in 2018.\n\nEliot's book was adapted into the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \"Cats\". The roles of Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were originated by John Thornton and Bonnie Langford in the West End in 1981.\n\nMungojerrie and Rumpleteazer are partners-in-crime, specialising in petty theft and mischief. In Eliot's original poem \"Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer\", they are depicted knocking over Ming vases and stealing items from their human family. As identical twins, their owners never know which of the two is responsible for the mischief. Mungojerrie is also mentioned in the poem \"Macavity, the Mystery Cat\", where he is rumoured to be one of Macavity's agents. They live in Victoria Grove in Kensington, England.\n\nWhile Rumpelteazer is suggested to be a male cat in Eliot's original poem (\"...they were plausible fellows...\"), the character is portrayed as female in the musical. Vocally, Mungojerrie is meant to be played by a high baritone and Rumpleteazer by a high belter. Acrobatic skills are also required to portray the duo.\n\nThe duo's eponymous song \"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\" has been revised several times. In the original London production, the number was a singsong-style duet that was mainly composed in time with a slower tempo and more jazz-like sound. When \"Cats\" opened on Broadway, the song was rewritten to be faster and more upbeat, alternating between vaudeville-style verses (in time) and a \"manic patter\" section (in time). The London version was later rewritten to incorporate some aspects of its Broadway counterpart. Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer dance throughout their number and perform acrobatic feats, including their \"trademark\" two-person cartwheels.\n\nA new setting of the song \"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\" was also written for the original Broadway production, in which the song was sung by Mr. Mistoffelees, while the actors playing Coricopat (Rene Clemente) and Etcetera (Christine Langner) danced the song as \"dolls\" made of junk, brought to life, and appearing out of the boot (trunk) of a car through the magic of Mr. Mistoffelees. In 1987, the Broadway production was re-worked and the song was given back to the characters of Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer, then played by Ray Roderick (who had formerly been the character Carbuckety) and Christine Langner, whose role of Etcetera was replaced by Rumpleteazer.\n\nOnstage, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer are usually costumed as orange, black and brown calico or tabby cats. When they perform their song, they have additional costume pieces: a vest and stockings for Mungojerrie; a garter belt, stockings and stolen jewellery for Rumpleteazer. In the original Broadway production, they wore baggy clown-like costumes seemingly made of various food wrappers as characters performing for Bustopher Jones.\n\nThe role of Mungojerrie was originated by John Thornton on the West End in 1981, and by Rene Clemente on Broadway in 1982. On screen, Mungojerrie was portrayed by Drew Varley in the 1998 film adaptation, and by Danny Collins in the 2019 film adaptation.\n\nRumpleteazer was originated by Bonnie Langford on the West End in 1981, and by Christine Langner on Broadway in 1982. On screen, the character was played by Jo Gibb in the 1998 filmed version, and by Naoimh Morgan in the 2019 film adaptation.\n\n\n"}

Created by Shotaro Ishinomori, this 32-episode series (which aired on TV Tokyo from 2/2/1977 to 9/28/1977), harkens back to tokusatsu superhero shows of the 1950s, but with a late-1970s twist. The series was first released on DVD in 2008.\n\nThis series is popular with fans of creator Ishinomori, and unique as the title hero Zubat does not \"henshin\" (transform) like the other superheroes he created. Ken Hayakawa (played by veteran Hiroshi Miyauchi), a private detective dressed in black & red gringo cowboy attire, actually just puts on his red & black \"Zubasuit\" (hidden in his white guitar, which is opened with the push of a button), which looks no different from that of a Sentai hero:\n\nZubat drove a car called the Zubat Car. Zubat's name is based on the sound effect \"zubatto,\" which is the sound of something being hit right on target.\n\nThe villains are also unusual, as there are no monsters, rather they originate from a large criminal organization named Dakker, which has a mysterious leader (who is revealed in the final episode as Fuhrer D), and outlandishly-dressed criminals. Many episodes of this series even had a bizarre Japanese \"wild west\" setting.\n\nAn episode would generally have a single head criminal, and a yojimbo, somehow terrorizing a group of people. Ken Hayakawa would happen upon this, and meet the yojimbo, which would lead to a demonstration of the latter's preferred skill, only for Ken Hayakawa to show that he was \"much\" better.\n\n\n\n\n\nZubat, along with Kikaider, Kikaider 01, and Inazuman made an appearance in in commemoration of the Toei Company's 60th Anniversary in 2011. This brief appearance saw the four heroes destroy the \"Kamen Rider Stronger\" villain, General Shadow.\n\nThis series would also be parodied by Daicon Films (now Gainax) in 1982, in a series of short films starring the superhero \"Kaiketsu Noutenki\" (who also has the same alter-ego, Ken Hayakawa). Zubat's costume was also a basis for the video game superhero parody \"Viewtiful Joe\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1974223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974223", "title": "Syndic", "text": "Syndic\n\nSyndic (Late Latin: '; Greek: ' – one who helps in a court of justice, an advocate, representative) is a term applied in certain countries to an officer of government with varying powers, and secondly to a representative or delegate of a university, institution or other corporation, entrusted with special functions or powers.\n\nThe meaning which underlies both applications is that of representative or delegate. Du Cange (\"Gloss, s.v. Syndicus\"), after defining the word as defensor, patronus, advocatus, proceeds \"Syndici maxime appellantur Actores universitatum, collegiorum, societatum et aliorum corporum, per quos, tanquam in republica quod communiter agi fierive oportet, agitur et fit,\" and gives several examples from the 13th century of the use of the term. The most familiar use of \"syndic\" in the first sense is that of the Italian \"sindaco\" (who is the head of the administration of a \"comune\", comparable to a mayor, and a government official, elected by the residents of commune.\n\nAs indicated above, in Italy and parts of Switzerland, the term \"sindaco\" or \"sindaca\" is equivalent to the English term mayor, in this case, the head of the administration of a \"comune\".\n\nIn areas where Catalan or Occitan are spoken, the term has been used since Medieval times. At present it is used in a variety of cases. The president of Andorra's parliament is known as the \"\"Síndic General\"\" or General Councillor. Until the 1993 Constitution, the Síndic was the effective head of government of Andorra. Similarly, the Sindic d'Aran / Síndic d'Aran (in Occitan and Catalan, respectively) is the head of the administration of this small region (Vall d'Aran) in Catalonia. In Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, the \"Síndic de Greuges\" or \"Síndica de Greuges\" (\"advocate of grievances\") is the ombudsman or ombudswoman, while the \"Síndic de Comptes\" or \"Síndica de Comptes\" is a board member of the Public Audit Office in each of the three regions. In the Valencian Parliament, the spokesperson or speaker of a parliamentary group is called a \"síndic\" or \"síndica\", and together they form the \"Junta de Síndics\" (Board of Spokespersons), while in the Horta de València region (the area around the city of Valencia), a \"síndic\" is also a member of the Water Tribunal (\"Tribunal de les Aigües\"), the body in charge of regulating irrigation matters. In Alguer, Sardinia, the \"síndic\" is the equivalent of mayor.\n\nIn Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, nearly all companies, guilds, and the University of Paris had representative bodies the members of which were termed \"syndici\". Similarly in England, the Regent House of the University of Cambridge, which is the legislative body, delegates certain functions to special committees of its members, appointed from time to time by Grace (a proposal offered to the Regent House and confirmed by it); these committees are termed \"syndicates\" and are permanent or occasional, and the members are styled \"the syndics\" of the particular committee or of the institution which they administer; thus there are the syndics of the Fitzwilliam Museum, of the Cambridge University Press, of local examinations, etc.\n\nThe term \"sindicat\" in Catalan is used in a broad sense to mean an association for the defence of the economic or social interests of its members, and therefore is often used generically to refer to labour organizations, as well as in the titles of certain labour organizations or federations (for instance, the Confederació Sindical de Treballadors de Catalunya, the Unió Sindical Obrera de Catalunya, the Coordinadora Obrera Sindical, etc.), student organizations (Sindicat d'Estudiants dels Països Catalans, Sindicat d'Estudiants del País Valencià, Sindicat Democràtic d'Estudiants de la Universitat de Barcelona, etc.) and journalist organizations (Sindicat de Periodistes de Catalunya / Sindicat de Professionals de la Comunicació, etc.), among others. The members or leaders of these organisations, however, are not called \"síndics\".\n\nIn some countries, notably France and Belgium, a \"syndic de copropriété\" (Dutch \"syndicus\") is an important figure in millions of lives, elected by owners of condominiums to represent property owners in the management of the co-owned building or property. While the profession is regulated, fees are not, and complaints of overcharging are frequent. The \"Association des responsables de copropriété\" (ARC) reported that fees rose by 4% in 2016, though the rate of inflation was only 0.2%, and since 2014 three of the largest \"syndics\" in Paris have raised their fees by amounts ranging from 26% to 37%.\n\nOne special use of the term applies to the Franciscan order of priests and brothers. The Order of Friars Minor (OFM), as opposed to the Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.) is forbidden by its constitutions from owning property, as part of its commitment to communal poverty. Various arrangements therefore exist whereby churches and houses of the order are owned by the Holy See itself, or the local diocese or, sometimes, by a \"syndic,\" an independent layman who is the actual owner of the land but who loans it to the friars.\n\nWithin Syndicalist and Anarcho-syndicalist organizations, a syndic is a member of an autonomous union, also called a Syndicate, which make up the basic organizational unit of society. As these models are organized along principles of non-hierarchy and direct democracy, the title syndic is applied to all in the syndicate and does not imply a position of power over any other member, unlike older usages of the title.\n\n"}

Until 2013 it was owned by Telecom Italia Media and operated by Telecom Italia. The head office is located in Rome.\n\nSignal overspill means that parts of Albania, Croatia, Switzerland, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, the Vatican City and Slovenia also receive La7 broadcasts.\n\nTele Monte Carlo (TMC) was the Italian language television channel from the Principality of Monaco. Telemontecarlo was founded in 1974 in the Principality of Monaco. During that time, the channel was the only competitor of Italian public television network RAI, broadcasting in colour. Since the introduction of Mediaset channels, TMC survived with some difficulties until 2001, but already in 1999 the last owner, the film producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori, sold the network to SEAT Pagine Gialle.\n\nThe first show transmitted by Telemontecarlo was Un peu d'amour, d'amitié et beaucoup de musique (A Little Bit of Love, Friendship and a Lot of Music), hosted by Jocelyn, who couldn't speak proper Italian at the time. \n\nOn 12 March 1982, RAI acquired the remaining 10% of the network. On 4 August 1985, Brazilian company Organizações Globo acquired the remaining 90%. The programming changed and included more Brazilian programmes like telenovelas and other television series. The channel also broadcast the Rio Carnival live. In general, the channel adopted the same station identification and commercial bumpers from Rede Globo, the largest commercial TV network in South America and the second-largest commercial TV network in annual revenue worldwide just behind the American ABC Television Network and the largest producer of telenovelas, with the music and graphics being adapted for the channel.\n\nIn 1993 Telemontecarlo became a member of Eurovision Network where they were broadcast parts of 1992 Summer Olympics, the 1992 America's Cup and the UEFA Euro 1992 football championship.\n\nIn 1994, Italian film producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori, who at that time already owner of Videomusic, acquired TMC, and then, in 1996, created TMC2 to compete with RAI and Mediaset networks. However, his intentions were thwarted and ratings were at an all-time low, because the channel lacked nationwide coverage in Italy. It was also at the time, in 1992, Organizações Globo took 15% of the shares in the new third TV channel in Portugal, SIC, which may have hurt TMC.\n\nIn 1996, the channel also tried to acquire the television rights of Serie A, competing against RAI. On 10 March 2000 the channel broadcast the Italian premiere of \"Sex and the City\".\n\nIn 1999 Vittorio Cecchi Gori sold the network to SEAT Pagine Gialle (part of Telecom Italia holding) and the channel moved from its historical headquarters in Monte Carlo to a new building in Rome.\n\nIn 2001, Lorenzo Pellicioli and Roberto Colaninno of Telecom Italia announced they had acquired Telemontecarlo, to create a strong competitor against the six other national channels in Italy. On 24 June 2001, the network changed the station name to \"La7\". \n\nAgainst the initial premises, like the hiring of popular TV hosts, anchors and journalists, La7 ratings and shares were much lower than its major competitors. However, in 2010–2011, the channel began doubling its rates, also thanks to current News director Enrico Mentana and his news program \"TG La7\". <br>\nOn 4 March 2013, it was announced the acquisition by Urbano Cairo's Cairo Editore. The sale was effective from 30 April 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For several years in the post-war era, the company underwent dramatic expansion and repeatedly almost became a major computer supplier, but eventually shed various divisions and returned to becoming an electrical grid supplier once again. The company was purchased in 1998 by the Austrian company, VA TECH. On July 23, 2005 Siemens PTD purchased VA Tech’s Transmission and Distribution Division (T&D) group for transformers and switchgear.\n\nPackard Electric had first been set up in 1894 in order to supply transformers during the Niagara Falls hydroelectric developments. Ferranti Canada had first been set up in 1912, acting primarily as a sales and distribution arm for their British designed electrical products.\n\nPrior to World War II, Canada's economy was primarily agricultural. While this allowed it to raise a fairly large army with relative ease, it also meant that it was unable to arm itself. C.D. Howe, Minister of Armaments, started an ambitious plan to heavily industrialize the country, turning it almost overnight into what is today a G8 nation.\n\nCanada had entered World War II completely unprepared, and in the post-war era decided they would not allow this to happen again. However, as the art of war turned increasingly technical, it was clear that Canada did not have the wherewithal to support a full program of research on its own. In 1947, the Defense Research Board (DRB) was formed, and sent out a letter outlining their ideas for sharing research between the armed forces, industry and academia.\n\nThe letter made its way to the desk of Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, the then-current CEO of the family-held British company. At the time, Ferranti in the UK was involved in a similar commercial/academic development project with Manchester University to build the Manchester Mark 1 computer, so it seemed that their Canadian division would naturally be able to do the same. In October 1948, he flew to Canada to meet with the DRB. He was disappointed to learn that the DRB did not have the financial resources to fund any sort of program, but Ferranti remained interested, even though it appeared the only way to work with the DRB would be for free.\n\nJust such a project started soon after, when word of the Ferranti meeting reached Lt Jim Belyea, a researcher in the Royal Canadian Navy's electrical labs (Electrical Engineer-in-Chief's Directorate). He had been proposing a completely automated system for ships to pass around tactical data from radar and sonar, to help organize the defence of a convoy under attack by submarines. Belyea presented his ideas to Ferranti, who agreed to start development of the technologies needed. By 1950, they had successfully developed a PCM-based radio system for passing digital data between ships, and the DRB started to become very interested. Full-scale development of the system, known as DATAR, started in February 1951 and underwent trials in late 1953. However, the cost of developing a production version was well beyond what the Royal Canadian Navy was able to afford. They attempted to sell the system to the United States Navy, but they were uninterested and the Canadians were forced to end the project. The US Navy later decided that they needed just such a system, having a rather unhappy experience with their Naval Tactical Data System in 1958.\n\nDuring this period, some time in 1951, Ferranti Canada also considered commercializing the University of Toronto's experimental UTEC computer, which seemed considerably less complex than the Mark I being developed in England. This effort also ended when in 1952, the University purchased a surplus Mark I originally intended for the UK's nuclear weapons program which had suffered massive budget cuts with a change of government.\n\nIn 1956, the company received a contract from the Canadian Post Office to develop an electronic mail sorting system, which they delivered later that year. The system used a hard-wired transistorized computer that stored a table of postal codes on a magnetic drum. Operators were presented with envelopes and typed in the postal code, which their typewriter printed onto the envelope as a bar code in fluorescent ink. The sorting system would then read the bar code and automatically route it sort it. The system was a complete success.\n\nThis system so impressed visitors from the US Post Office that they decided they needed one of their own. They also decided to develop their own system instead of simply buying the Ferranti one, delaying their entry into automated sorting until 1960. A Canada-wide expansion using Ferranti's existing system soon ended in the 1957 election, whose main issue was rampant Liberal spending, including Ferranti's \"million dollar monster\".\n\nOddly, the system was later adapted for cheque sorting by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, who took delivery of an almost identical machine in 1958, based on reading MICR digits instead of bar codes. This MICR-based concept was originally developed by SRI International in 1952 for their similar ERMA project, but they did not manage to actually deliver their machine until 1959. There was some talk of developing the Ferranti system into a commercial line, but it became clear that as general purpose computers fell in price, a single mass-produced model would soon be able to outperform a custom-built design, even on cost. Honeywell started shopping around for just such a system at about this time.\n\nAnother brush with success came in 1959 with the ReserVec on-line reservation system developed for Trans-Canada Air Lines. This product suffered from stiff competition from IBM's SABRE system in the US, but there was nothing similar in the UK, whose own airlines were in the market for such a system. Apparently due largely to not invented here problems, Ferranti in the UK decided to develop an entirely new system to fill this need, instead of using the Canadian version.\n\nBut by this time, Ferranti's UK computer divisions were themselves in turmoil. Their attempt to commercialize the Atlas design was dragging on, and meanwhile sales of their older Mercury were drying up. In order to address this, as well as move into a new market segment, they decided to launch a newer system aimed at the low-end of the market. The result was the Ferranti Orion, which used an entirely new circuity system known as \"Neuron\". This proved to be somewhat of a disaster, and only 12 Orion I machines ever shipped (the first went to AB Turitz and Co., of Gothenburg, Sweden, in March 1963).\n\nMeanwhile, Ferranti-Packard decided they should set up production for the Atlas machine as well, but after successfully securing loans from the government they were astounded to learn that the UK division refused to allow them access to the design. Many of the company's engineers resigned in disgust, although some were later convinced to stay on. The UK division then asked several Canadian engineers to move to England in an attempt to re-engineer the Orion based on ReserVec's transistorized circuits. Known as Orion II, the project ran in parallel to the original Orion for some time. (Orion II was much more successful, both technically and commercially, than its predecessor. Nearly 40 machines were delivered by the end of 1964.)\n\nWith the experience gained during Orion II the engineers returned to Toronto convinced that ReserVec's design sold into the Orion's marketplace would be a commercial success. Once again approaching the Federal Reserve Bank, they proposed to build a new machine to replace the earlier post-office-derived system. The Bank accepted the proposal, and work on what would become the Ferranti-Packard 6000 started in late 1961. This joint venture with Pitney-Bowes was one of five MICR trials at various FRB districts. The system was delivered in early 1963 and removed a year later.\n\nIn order to differentiate themselves from the numerous models in this performance range, the FP-6000 would directly support multitasking, then known as \"multiprogramming\", as well as be highly modular. The prototype machine was completed in 1962, and was delivered to the FRB in early 1963. Further sales proved difficult however. One was purchased by the DRB's station in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, another by the Toronto Stock Exchange , one by Saskatchewan Power, and a final machine by a research facility in Dalkeith, bringing the total to five sales.\n\nMeanwhile, unknown to Ferranti-Packard, Ferranti in the UK had decided to cut their losses and exit the commercial computer business. In early 1963, they approached International Computers and Tabulators with the proposal to sell off their commercial division. Perhaps unsurprisingly, ICT found the proposal unattractive. When they learned of the FP-6000 their attitude changed, and they eventually agreed to the purchase under the stipulation that rights to the FP-6000 would be transferred from Canada. The FP-6000 then became the basis for ICT 1900 series machines, which eventually sold into the thousands.\n\nAfter the ICT takeover, Ferranti-Packard proposed that they manufacture several models of the 1900-series, as well as serve as a gateway into the North American market. ICT, however, was interested in Europe only. Most of the FP-6000 engineers soon left the company, forming ESE Limited and Teklogix.\nThe programmers founded I. P. Sharp Associates in December 1964.\n\nOne of the Canadian company's last developments was the flip-disc display, which creates a large display out of a grid of small disks, painted black on one side and some bright color (typically yellow) on the other. A small magnet glued to the disk responded to a magnetic pulse from a coil which surrounded the disk. The direction of current through the coil determined the side to display. A display system was sold to the Montreal and Canadian stock exchanges in 1964. The UK headquarters gave the invention little note, but it became somewhat successful in spite of this, and HQ eventually used it as a way to try to sell off the Canadian division in the 1970s. Today, these displays can commonly be found in outdoor use, notably on highway signage and in the automotive application of destination signs for public service vehicles.\nIt was also used as the game board display on \"Family Feud\" from 1976 to 1995.\n\nWith the electronics division empty, Ferranti-Packard was once again a major electrical vendor only. Over the years, many other specialty divisions were sold off or closed, and eventually all that was left was the original Packard transformer division. It was this that VA TECH purchased.\n\nCORPORATE ARCHIVES\n\nThe Archives of Ontario holds numerous Ferranti-Packard records that were transferred by Rolls Royce in 1991, including textual records, photographs, technical drawings, audio reels, films and videocassettes. It also holds material donated in 2002 by Mr. Paul Coleman and in 2006 by Siemens Canada. \n\nThe St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre also holds a collection of material about the Ferranti-Packard.\n\n"}

{"id": "1974235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974235", "title": "Belief–desire–intention software model", "text": "Belief–desire–intention software model\n\nThe belief–desire–intention software model (BDI) is a software model developed for programming intelligent agents. Superficially characterized by the implementation of an agent's \"beliefs\", \"desires\" and \"intentions\", it actually uses these concepts to solve a particular problem in agent programming. In essence, it provides a mechanism for separating the activity of selecting a plan (from a plan library or an external planner application) from the execution of currently active plans. Consequently, BDI agents are able to balance the time spent on deliberating about plans (choosing what to do) and executing those plans (doing it). A third activity, creating the plans in the first place (planning), is not within the scope of the model, and is left to the system designer and programmer.\n\nIn order to achieve this separation, the BDI software model implements the principal aspects of Michael Bratman's theory of human practical reasoning (also referred to as Belief-Desire-Intention, or BDI). That is to say, it implements the notions of belief, desire and (in particular) intention, in a manner inspired by Bratman. For Bratman, belief and desire are both pro-attitudes (mental attitudes concerned with action), but intention is distinguished as a conduct-controlling pro-attitude. He identifies commitment as the distinguishing factor between desire and intention, noting that it leads to (1) temporal persistence in plans and (2) further plans being made on the basis of those to which it is already committed. The BDI software model partially addresses these issues. Temporal persistence, in the sense of explicit reference to time, is not explored. The hierarchical nature of plans is more easily implemented: a plan consists of a number of steps, some of which may invoke other plans. The hierarchical definition of plans itself implies a kind of temporal persistence, since the overarching plan remains in effect while subsidiary plans are being executed.\n\nAn important aspect of the BDI software model (in terms of its research relevance) is the existence of logical models through which it is possible to define and reason about BDI agents. Research in this area has led, for example, to the axiomatization of some BDI implementations, as well as to formal logical descriptions such as Anand Rao and Michael Georgeff's BDICTL. The latter combines a multiple-modal logic (with modalities representing beliefs, desires and intentions) with the temporal logic CTL*. \nMore recently, Michael Wooldridge has extended BDICTL to define LORA (the Logic Of Rational Agents), by incorporating an action logic. In principle, LORA allows reasoning not only about individual agents, but also about communication and other interaction in a multi-agent system.\n\nThe BDI software model is closely associated with intelligent agents, but does not, of itself, ensure all the characteristics associated with such agents. For example, it allows agents to have private beliefs, but does not force them to be private. It also has nothing to say about agent communication. Ultimately, the BDI software model is an attempt to solve a problem that has more to do with plans and planning (the choice and execution thereof) than it has to do with the programming of intelligent agents.\n\nA BDI agent is a particular type of bounded rational software agent, imbued with particular \"mental attitudes\", viz: Beliefs, Desires and Intentions (BDI).\n\nThis section defines the idealized architectural components of a BDI system.\n\n\nBDI was also extended with an obligations component, giving rise to the BOID agent architecture to incorporate obligations, norms and commitments of agents that act within a social environment.\n\nThis section defines an idealized BDI interpreter that provides the basis of SRI's PRS lineage of BDI systems:\n\n\nThe BDI software model is one example of a reasoning architecture for a single rational agent, and one concern in a broader multi-agent system. This section bounds the scope of concerns for the BDI software model, highlighting known limitations of the architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was drafted by then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and issued by George W. Bush on November 1, 2001. Section 13 of Order 13233 revoked which was issued by Ronald Reagan on January 18, 1989.\n\nIn 1974, Congress passed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974, placing the presidential records of Richard Nixon in federal custody to prevent their destruction. The legislative action was intended to reduce secrecy, while allowing historians to perform their responsibilities. In 1972, decades worth of official and unofficial Federal Bureau of Investigation records had been destroyed, upon the death of J. Edgar Hoover, by his longtime secretary, Helen Gandy. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 expanded such protection of historical records, by mandating that the records of former presidents would automatically become the property of the federal government upon their departures from the Oval Office, and then transferred to the Archivist of the United States, thereafter to be made available to the public after no more than 12 years.\n\nThus, the presidential papers of Ronald Reagan were due to be made public when George W. Bush took office in January 2001. However, in a White House memo dated March 23, 2001, the Counsel to the President conveyed the following to U.S Archivist John W. Carlin:\n\nSection 2(b) of Executive Order 12667, issued by former President Ronald Reagan on January 16, 1989, requires the Archivist of the United States to delay release of Presidential records at the instruction of the current President. On behalf of the President, I instruct you to extend for 90 days (until June 21, 2001) the time in which President Bush may claim a constitutionally based privilege over the Presidential records that former President Reagan, acting under Section 2204(a) of Title 4, has protected from disclosure for the 12 years since the end of his Presidency. This directive applies as well to the Vice Presidential records of former Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThis instruction was repeated on June 6, 2001, before the 90 days had elapsed, giving a new deadline of August 31, 2001. On the day of this deadline, Alberto Gonzales instructed the Archivist to wait a few additional weeks. On November 1, 2001, Bush issued Executive Order 13233, limiting the access to the records of former U.S. Presidents:\n...reflecting military, diplomatic, or national security secrets, Presidential communications, legal advice, legal work, or the deliberative processes of the President and the President's advisers, and to do so in a manner consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in \"Nixon v. Administrator of General Services\", 433 U.S. 425 (1977), and other cases...\n\nThe Society of American Archivists and the American Library Association were critical of the president's exercise of executive power by issuing EO 13233. They claimed that the action \"violates both the spirit and letter of existing U.S. law on access to presidential papers as clearly laid down in ,\" noting that the order \"potentially threatens to undermine one of the very foundations of our nation.\"\n\nJohn Wertman, a member of former President Bill Clinton's White House staff, wrote an op-ed piece critical of the executive order that appeared in \"The Washington Post\" on February 26, 2006. Wertman asserted that Order 13233 \"represents a wholesale change in the way the federal government preserves and promotes our national public memory.\" He also included a quote from former President Gerald Ford on the topic: \"I firmly believe that after X period of time, presidential papers, except for the most highly sensitive documents involving our national security, should be made available to the public, and the sooner the better.\"\n\nBefore January 21, 2009, there were three separate attempts to repeal Order 13233. In 2002, shortly after Order 13233 went into effect, a bipartisan group of U.S. House of Representatives members, led by Stephen Horn (R-CA), Dan Burton (R-IN), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), and Henry Waxman (D-CA) wrote and debated a bill aimed at repealing Order 13233, thereby restoring Order 12667 to full force and effect. The bill passed the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which was chaired by Burton at the time, but never saw floor action.\n\nOn March 1, 2007, a subcommittee of the Committee on Government Reform held a hearing on bill , the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007. This bill was also introduced by Waxman, and its goal was again to void Order 13233. At the hearing, several historians argued that Order 13233 has severely curtailed public access to presidential records and added to delays in obtaining materials from presidential libraries. The bill was reported favorably by the full committee, and on March 14, 2007, the House passed the bill in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 333-93. The bill also passed on June 13, 2007 in a Senate committee, but was never brought to the floor for a vote, reportedly due to a hold placed on the measure by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY). As a result, the bill died when the 110th Congress ended.\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the House of the 111th Congress passed , introduced by Edolphus Towns (D-NY), section 3 of which would, if enacted, negate Order 13233. The bill was co-sponsored by Dan Burton (R-IN), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Henry Waxman (D-CA), William Clay (D-MO), and Brad Sherman (D-CA). The bill died in the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\nIn November 2001, the National Security Archive, the American Historical Association and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the D.C. District Court against the National Archives and Records Administration and the Archivist, claiming constitutional problems with the order, and pointing out that \"access to materials may be delayed for an unlimited period of time after the expiration of the 12-year restriction period while a former president and the incumbent president ‘review’ materials proposed for release\", because of § 3(b) of the order, which states\nAfter receiving the records he requests, the former President shall review those records as expeditiously as possible, and for no longer than 90 days for requests that are not unduly burdensome. The Archivist shall not permit access to the records by a requester during this period of review or when requested by the former President to extend the time for review.\nWhile most of the lawsuit was found to be nonjusticiable at this time due to lack of ripeness, in October 2007 the Court held that \"the Archivist’s reliance on § 3(b) of Executive Order 13,233 is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, and not in accordance with law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act\" and enjoined \"the Archivist from further relying on § 3(b) of Executive Order 13,233\". The rest of the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice.\n\nOn January 21, 2009, Executive Order 13233 was revoked by executive order of President Barack Obama. Obama essentially restored the wording of Executive Order 12667, by repeating most of the text of that order with minor changes. One notable change is that vice presidential records are explicitly covered by his new order.\n\n\n\n "}

Fenn had perhaps a rather dark view of his Chinese contemporaries, as can be adduced from several remarks attributed to him in \"New Forces in Old China\" (1904) by Arthur Judson Brown:\n\nAny man who has had the least occasion to deal with Chinese courts knows that `every man has his price,' that not only every underling can be bought, but that 999 out of every 1,000 officials, high or low, will favour the man who offers the most money.\n\n...every village and town and city—it would not be a very serious exaggeration to say every home,--fairly reeks with impurity.\n\nI would be almost willing to assert that it is impossible for a man, brought up in China, then spending many years abroad, to return to China and write such a book in honesty and sincerity of heart. He could not possibly help knowing that nine-tenths of what he was writing about China was absolutely untrue, that her political, legal, social, domestic and personal life are rotten to the core...\n\nIsaac Taylor Headland of Peking University, in his book \"The Chinese Boy and Girl\", recounts that his own interest in Chinese children's rhymes began with a summer-time conversation with Mrs. Fenn on the veranda of the Fenns' house in the hills, fifteen miles west of Peking, in which he heard a nurse teach the following rhyme to her child Henry Fenn:\n\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\n"}

Duncan about Arthur Andersen policies regarding retention of documents from client engagements. Duncan oversaw the shredding of Arthur Andersen documents concerning their work for client Enron, between October 22 and November 9, 2001 (See the Timeline of the Enron scandal). A memo from Nancy Temple played a key role in the conviction of Arthur Andersen on charges of obstruction of justice. That conviction was later overturned.\n\nNancy Temple graduated from the University of Illinois College of Business in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy.\nAfter graduation, Ms. Temple attended Harvard Law School where she graduated with a Juris Doctorate in 1989.\nShe began her career at Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, now known as Sidley Austin. She worked at the law firm for 11 years and was inducted as a partner. Ms. Temple specialized in accounting liability.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Arthur Andersen in a unanimous decision.\n\nChief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said the former Big Five accounting firm's obstruction-of-justice conviction was improper because the instructions at trial were too vague for jurors to determine correctly whether Andersen obstructed justice. \"'[T]he jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing,\" he wrote. \"[I]t is striking how little culpability the instructions required.\"\n\nIn post-conviction interviews, several of the Arthur Andersen jurors indicated that the \"guilty\" verdict was proximately based upon an internal October 16, 2001 email from in-house Arthur Andersen attorney Nancy Temple. The text of the email from Nancy Temple is as follows:\n\nThe Supreme Court's unanimous reversal of the conviction reinforces the opinion that the jury should not have inferred any liability on Arthur Andersen based solely upon the October 16 memo. Rather, Ms. Temple's bar license required that she not do anything that would waive the \"attorney-client\" privilege of Enron or Arthur Andersen. By having her name and a legal reference removed, in effect she was making the subject memo suitable for public disclosure – it was no longer a \"privileged\" document.\n\nIn addition, public accounting firms had a duty to notify the SEC within a defined time window if the accountants disagreed with a public accounting filing by a client. Ms. Temple's memo notes that the subject matter at issue was determined not to be of a nature that would require that Arthur Andersen to notify the SEC - i.e., a \"Section 10A\" filing, and her memo indicates that she will consult with the lawyers – again – to verify that conclusion.\n\nNancy Temple is now married and has three sons.\nAfter the Arthur Andersen case, Ms. Temple began working for Freeman, Freeman & Salzman P.C., a currently defunct law firm.\nOn April 1, 2008, Ms. Temple returned to practice law at Katten & Temple LLP, a firm she co-founded.

{"id": "1974329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974329", "title": "King-Emperor", "text": "King-Emperor\n\nA king-emperor, the female equivalent being queen-empress, is a sovereign ruler who is simultaneously a king of one territory and emperor of another. This title usually results from a merger of a royal and imperial crown, but recognises that the two territories are different politically or culturally and in status (emperor being a higher rank than king). It also denotes a king's imperial status through the acquisition of an empire or vice versa.\n\nThe dual title signifies a sovereign's dual role, but may also be created to improve a ruler's prestige. Both cases, however, show that the merging of rule was not simply a case of annexation where one state is swallowed by another, but rather of unification and almost equal status, though in the case of the British monarchy the suggestion that an emperor is higher in rank than a king was avoided by creating the title \"king-emperor\" (\"queen-empress\") instead of \"emperor-king\" (\"empress-queen\").\n\nThe British Crown had officially taken over the governing of British India from the East India Company in 1858, in the aftermath of what the British called 'the Indian Mutiny'. Henceforth, the new British Raj was ruled directly from Whitehall via the India Office. Following the Delhi Durbar in 1877, Queen Victoria was given Imperial status by the British Government, and she assumed the title Empress of India. She was thus the Queen-Empress, and her successors, until George VI, were known as King-Emperors. This title was the shortened form of the full title, and in widespread popular use.\n\nThe reigning King-Emperors or Queen-Empress used the initials \"R I\" (\"Rex Imperator\" or \"Regina Imperatrix\") or the abbreviation \"Ind. Imp.\" (\"Indiae Imperator/Imperatrix\") after their name (while the one reigning Queen-Empress, Victoria, used the initials \"R I\", the three consorts of the married King-Emperors simply used \"R\").\n\nBritish coins, and those of the British Empire and Commonwealth dominions, routinely included some variation of the titles \"Rex Ind. Imp.\", although in India itself the coins said \"Empress\", and later \"King Emperor.\" When, in August 1947, India became independent, all dies had to be changed to remove the latter two abbreviations, in some cases taking up to a year. In Great Britain, coins of George VI carried the title up to 1948.\n\nAnother use of this dual title was when, in 1867, the multi-national Austrian Empire, which was German-ruled and facing growing nationalism, undertook a reform that gave nominal and factual rights to Hungarian nobility. This reform revived the Austrian-annexed Kingdom of Hungary, and therefore created the dual-monarchic union state of Austria-Hungary and the dual title of \"emperor-king\" (in German \"Kaiser und König\").\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty therefore ruled as Emperors of Austria over the western and northern half of the Empire (Cisleithania), and as Kings of Hungary over the Kingdom of Hungary and much of Transleithania. Hungary enjoyed some degree of self-government and representation in joint affairs (principally foreign relations and defence). The federation bore the full name of \"The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen\".\n\nIn 1936, with the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, Victor Emmanuel III was proclaimed Emperor of Ethiopia. Thus he became King-Emperor (in Italian \"Re Imperatore\"), i.e., King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia, because conquered Ethiopia was then an Empire. In the following years foreign countries recognized the Italian rule in Ethiopia (UK in 1937).\n\nThe King-Emperor was represented by the Viceroy, who was also appointed as Governor-General of Italian East Africa (AOI - Africa Orientale Italiana). The capital city of the Viceroy and Governor-General was Addis Ababa.\n\n\n"}

The settlement was then a railroad terminus. (In the 20th century Grady Memorial Hospital was developed at this site.)\n\nThe area's structures were built by poor workers and settlers largely with slabs and leftover lumber from pioneer Jonathan Norcross's sawmill. As the railroad terminus grew, this area was associated with vice: brothels, saloons, and gambling. \n\nDubbed the \"Father of Atlanta\" and \"hard fighter of everything,\" Jonathan Norcross was a pioneer in the railroad town. Born in 1808 and raised in Maine, along with his six siblings, he late exemplified a pioneer spirit and ambition. \n\nFollowing Indian Removal in the 1830s, in 1844 Norcross moved to northern Georgia, where he became a successful dry goods merchant and sawmill operator. His sawmill produced mainly railroad ties and string timbers for the assembly of the Georgia Railroad, which had a terminus at Atlanta. Reclaiming timber and debris discarded by the sawmill, poor settlers quickly began building crude shanties for their families.\n\nIn 1845 pioneer life could be characterized as desolate and distinct with simple pleasures. The numerous male railroad workers in Atlanta sought rough trade. About 15 years before the American Civil War was a time of ill repute for Atlanta; the railroad town was known for vice and political corruption. A collection of huts, whorehouses, shacks, and saloons began developing in the settlement. \n\nNorcross commented, \"the reason why the streets are so crooked, is that every man built on his land just to suit himself.\" He was elected as the fourth mayor of Atlanta.\n\nSlabtown was considered a \"wicked development\" that offended \"the good citizens of Atlanta, as crimes were often committed there, and many of the young men fell into bad habits from frequenting Slab Town. In these places, occurred scenes of debauchery and indecency that shocked the moral sense of the community.\"\n\nAtlanta's leaders demonstrated the need for law and order by their hasty municipal decisions. In 1902 an informal militia in disguise, known as White Caps, attacked Slab Town by night. They whipped the men found in huts devoted to prostitution and other vices, and warned them to leave town. They burned down the shanties and the area was abandoned. The residents were displaced by force. As Atlanta developed in the 20th century, this area was redeveloped for what is now Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\nIn early February 2010, Atlanta BeltLine, Inc. (ABI) and Atlanta's Office of Cultural Affairs developed a project \"Art on the BeltLine: Atlanta's New Public Place\" as part of redevelopment of the former industrial areas around the city. They sequenced visual and performance art installations, as well as historic site interpretations, at different points along the Atlanta BeltLine to draw the public. A sculptural homage of the City's historic Slabtown was assembled by the contemporary art collective THE STATUS FACTION. Located on Irwin Street at the BeltLine, the \"Slab Town\" installation resembles the \"slab-style residences\" which were destroyed and abandoned in 1902. \n\n"}

It originally aired on March 13, 1964 on CBS. In this episode, a man's television set displays his past, present, and future, revealing to him that he will kill his wife.\n\nJoe and Phyllis Britt are an old married couple in New York City who do not get along. Joe gets home from his job as a cab driver late one night, and Phyllis accuses him of seeing another woman. In the meantime, a television repairman is in the next room fixing their broken set. Irritated, Joe harasses the repairman about the inconvenience and cost. The repairman abruptly closes the open TV panel and announces the TV is fixed. After stating the job is free, he leaves, and the TV starts getting channel 10—a station showing the past, present, and future of Joe and Phyllis' lives. Joe refuses to let Phyllis watch the TV and faints when he sees himself and Phyllis talking about getting engaged. \n\nThe TV shows Joe seeing another woman, and when he tunes in again later, it shows him killing Phyllis in a fight. Joe breaks down at the sight and tells Phyllis what is happening. Phyllis seeks help from the family doctor, who gives Joe a sedative and says that seeing oneself on television is one of several common delusions manifested by the struggle to adjust to the new technology of television.\n\nProfoundly disturbed by the sight of Phyllis' death, Joe tries to heal their relationship, telling her that he accepts the blame for their feuding and has realized that his extramarital affairs were only an escape from the stress of his job, that Phyllis is still the one he really loves. Embittered by years of Joe's coldness and philandering, Phyllis scorns his attempt at reconciliation. When he begins reacting to another channel 10 vision – this one showing his trial and conviction for Phyllis's murder and his execution in the electric chair – even as Phyllis sees only static, Phyllis is convinced that Joe has lost his mind and taunts him. Joe, angered, attacks her, and kills her in the same manner as he had seen on the television screen.\n\nAs Joe is arrested by the police, he comes face-to-face with the TV repairman, who mockingly asks, \"Fix your set okay, Mister? You \"will\" recommend my service, won't you?\" The repairman smirks as Joe is taken away.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1974361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974361", "title": "Center embedding", "text": "Center embedding\n\nIn linguistics, center embedding is the process of embedding a phrase in the middle of another phrase of the same type. This often leads to difficulty with parsing which would be difficult to explain on grammatical grounds alone. The most frequently used example involves embedding a relative clause inside another one as in:\n\nIn theories of natural language parsing, the difficulty with multiple center embedding is thought to arise from limitations of the human short term memory. In order to process multiple center embeddings, we have to store many subjects in order to connect them to their predicates.\n\nAn interesting theoretical point is that sentences with multiple center embedding are grammatical, but unacceptable. Such examples are behind Noam Chomsky's comment that, \"Languages are not 'designed for parsability' … we may say that languages, as such, are not usable.\" (Chomsky, 1991)\n\nSome researchers (such as Peter Reich) came up with theories that though single center embedding is acceptable (as in \"the man that boy kicked is a friend of mine\"), double center embedding is not. The linguist Anne De Roeck and colleagues provided a counter-example: \"Isn't it true that example-sentences that people that you know produce are more likely to be accepted?\" (De Roeck et al., 1982).\n\nThe linguist Fred Karlsson provided empirical evidence in 2007 that the maximal degree of multiple center-embedding of clauses is exactly 3 in written language. He provided thirteen genuine examples of this type from various Indo-European languages (Danish, English, German, Latin, Swedish). No real examples of degree 4 have been recorded. In spoken language, multiple center-embeddings even of degree 2 are so rare as to be practically non-existing (Karlsson 2007).\n\nCenter embedding is the focus of a science fiction novel, Ian Watson's \"The Embedding\", and plays a part in Ted Chiang's \"Story of Your Life\".\n\nEmbedding on its own refers to all types of clauses occurring as subordinate parts of a superordinate clause. There are three types of sub-clauses: complement, relative, and adverbial. Subordinators or relative pronouns indicate which sub clause is being used. Center embedding (abbreviated \"C\" or \"c\") contains words of the superordinate clause on the left and the right of the sub-clauses. Multiple center embedding of the same type of clause is called self-embedding.\n\nIn the English language we can create an infinite number of sentences, even though we have a set number of words and grammatical rules. We can create infinite sentences because of the rules of recursion and iteration. The rule of recursion is how we come to center embedding by embedding one sentence within another sentence. Linguists say that center embedding could go on forever and technically be grammatically correct. The reader would however become confused trying to keep track of who did what and when because our working memory would not be able to store and keep track of all the information. Given enough time and a piece of paper and pencil, the reader could work out the information until the sentence made sense.\n\nEmbedding can be used when two clauses share a common category and can expand a sentence. It is not effective when optional categories are used to create extensive embedding in a sentence.\n\nMy brother opened the window. The maid had closed it.\n-The common category is the window. So this sentence can be expanded to become\nMy brother opened the window the maid had closed.\n\n\nThere is no common category for this sentence. So it should be broken up into multiple sentences to make sense to the reader:\n\n\nA center embedded sentence is difficult to comprehend when a relative clause is embedded in another relative clause. Comprehension becomes easier when the types of clause are different when a complement clause is embedded in a relative clause or when a relative clause is embedded in a complement clause. For example: The man who heard that the dog had been killed on the radio ran away.\n\nYou can tell if a sentence is center embedded or edge embedded depending on where the brackets are located in the sentence.\n\n\nIn sentence (1), all of the brackets are located on the right, so this sentence is right-embedded. In sentence (2), the brackets are located inside the sentence spaced throughout.\n\n\n\n"}

They began performing together in the 1990s as part of two different bands with Montgomery's brother, John Michael Montgomery. Although Gentry won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery after Gentry was unable to find a solo record deal, and Montgomery Gentry was formed in 1999. The duo is known for its Southern rock influences, and collaborated with Charlie Daniels, Toby Keith, Five for Fighting, and members of The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nMontgomery Gentry released six studio albums for Columbia Records' Nashville division: \"Tattoos & Scars\" (1999), \"Carrying On\" (2001), \"My Town\" (2002), \"You Do Your Thing\" (2004), \"Some People Change\" (2006), and \"Back When I Knew It All\" (2008), and a Greatest Hits package. These albums produced more than twenty chart singles for the duo on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts, including the 1 hits, \"If You Ever Stop Loving Me\", \"Something to Be Proud Of\", \"Lucky Man\", \"Back When I Knew It All\", and \"Roll with Me\". Ten more of their songs reached the Top 10 on the country charts, including the 3 hit, \"Gone\", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. \"Tattoos & Scars\", \"My Town\", and \"You Do Your Thing\" are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the American Music Awards. Both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association named them Duo of the Year in 2000, an award for which they have been nominated by both associations in every year since. In 2009, they were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nOn September 8, 2017, Gentry died in a helicopter crash in Medford, New Jersey, where the duo was scheduled to perform that evening. Despite Gentry's death, Montgomery continues to tour under the Montgomery Gentry name.\n\nGerald Edward Montgomery was born September 30, 1963, in Danville, Kentucky. Troy Lee Gentry (April 5, 1967 – September 8, 2017) was born in Lexington, Kentucky. When Montgomery was thirteen years old, he played drums in his parents' band, Harold Montgomery and the Kentucky River Express. In 1990, Montgomery founded the band Early Tymz, which included his younger brother, John Michael Montgomery, and Troy Gentry.\n\nAfter Early Tymz disbanded, the Montgomery brothers and Gentry briefly performed as Young Country, with John Michael as lead vocalist. John Michael left for a solo career in the early 1990s. Gentry went solo and won the Jim Beam National Talent Contest in 1994, which led to him opening for Patty Loveless and Tracy Byrd. Gentry initially wanted to pursue a solo career, but after he was unable to find a record deal, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery to form a duo called Deuce, which played at local nightclubs. The duo later changed its name to Montgomery Gentry, and signed with Columbia Records' Nashville division in 1999.\n\nMontgomery Gentry released its debut single, \"Hillbilly Shoes\", in early 1999. It entered the \"Billboard\" country singles charts two weeks before its scheduled release date, peaking at number 13 on the country charts and 62 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. High radio demand for the single led to the label advancing the release date of the duo's debut album, \"Tattoos & Scars\", from early May to April 6.\n\n\"Lonely and Gone\" was the album's second single, peaking at number 5 on the country charts by year's end. The song was co-written by Dave Gibson and former Pirates of the Mississippi lead singer Bill McCorvey. Following it was the top 20 \"Daddy Won't Sell the Farm\", which won its co-writer, Canadian country singer Steve Fox, the 2000 Society of Composers, Authors, and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) award for Song of the Year. After it, Montgomery Gentry charted the number 31 singles \"Self Made Man\" and \"All Night Long\". The latter, which featured guest vocals from Charlie Daniels, was previously the b-side to \"Hillbilly Shoes\". It was also Daniels' first appearance in the top 40 since \"Mister DJ\" in 1990. The duo won the Vocal Duo of the Year award at the Country Music Association Awards in late 2000, the first time in eight years that Brooks & Dunn did not win this award. They also won the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award from the Academy of Country Music and the 2000 Favorite New Artist—Country award at the American Music Awards. By the end of 2000, Montgomery Gentry charted at number 38 with a cover of Robert Earl Keen's \"Merry Christmas from the Family\", itself the b-side to \"All Night Long\". \"Tattoos & Scars\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2001, for shipments of one million copies.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews for the duo's Southern rock influences. Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave it four stars out of five, calling it \"one of the best pop records of the year. Period.\" and Alanna Nash of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it \"B\", saying that the album was \"testosterone-laden\". In comparison, \"Country Standard Time\" reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz thought that many of the duo's songs lacked distinctiveness, saying that they seemed to be derivative of Daniels and Travis Tritt.\n\nMontgomery Gentry's second album, \"Carrying On\", was released in mid-2001. Lead-off single \"She Couldn't Change Me\" peaked at number 2 on the country charts and number 37 on the Hot 100, making their first Top 40 entry there. The album's only other single, \"Cold One Comin' On\", reached number 23 on the country charts. Also included on the album was a cover of Waylon Jennings' \"I'm a Ramblin' Man\". In March 2002, they charted at number 45 with the track \"Didn't I\", a cut from the soundtrack to the film \"We Were Soldiers\" which was never officially released as a single. The duo promoted the album both on a headline tour sponsored by Jim Beam, and on the Brooks & Dunn Neon Circus & Wild West Tour, which included Toby Keith and Keith Urban. Later in 2002, they toured with Kenny Chesney on his No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems tour.\n\nMike Kraski, then the senior vice president of sales and marketing at Sony Music Nashville, thought that \"Carrying On\" showed an artistic growth over \"Tattoos & Scars\", and the duo itself thought that \"Carrying On\" was more \"edgy\" in comparison. It was less favorably received than its predecessor; William Ruhlmann thought that many of the songs \"sound like they're trying to hard to be macho\", and \"Country Standard Time\"'s Mike Clark thought that the duo was \"playing it safe\", although he described the singles favorably. The album was certified gold for shipments of 500,000 copies.\n\nOn August 27, 2002, Montgomery Gentry released \"My Town\". After working with producer Joe Scaife on their first two albums, they switched to Blake Chancey. He allowed them to pick different session musicians than typically used on mainstream country albums, such as Chuck Leavell and Johnny Neel of The Allman Brothers Band, whose \"Good Clean Fun\" was covered on it. They also chose songs co-written by songwriters who had not appeared on their previous albums, including Jeffrey Steele and Rivers Rutherford. The album produced three singles, all co-written by Steele: the title track and \"Speed\" both at number 5, and \"Hell Yeah\" at number 4. Along with Blake Shelton and Andy Griggs, they contributed a guest appearance on Tracy Byrd's mid-2003 single \"The Truth About Men\", which made the country top 20. In March 2004, \"My Town\" became the duo's second platinum-certified album.\n\nRuhlmann gave the album a generally positive review, saying that it \"rocks harder as it goes along\". On the same site, Rick Cohoon praised \"My Town\" for \"painting in words and music both the pace of living in a small town\", and \"Speed\" for being \"slower and more deliberate than the recklessness the title suggests.\" On \"Country Standard Time\", Tom Netherland called it \"their third and finest release\".\n\n\"You Do Your Thing\", their fourth album, was issued in mid-2004. It was led off by \"If You Ever Stop Loving Me\", which in mid-2004 became Montgomery Gentry's first number 1 single on the country charts. It was also their biggest hit on the Hot 100, reaching number 30 there. Following it, the album's title track went to number 22 on the country charts, while \"Gone\" peaked at number 3 and \"Something to Be Proud Of\" became their second number 1 single. The song spent two weeks at number 1, thus making it the first single for Columbia Records' Nashville division to spend more than one week at number 1 since \"Daddy's Money\" by Ricochet in 1996. \"Gone\" was also the most-played single by a country music duo in 2005, and it received a digital gold certification for 500,000 certified music downloads. \"You Do Your Thing\" became their third platinum-selling album. Scaife, Chancey, Rutherford, Steele, and Mark Wright split production duties on the album. Steele also co-wrote \"Gone\" and \"Something to Be Proud Of\" with Bob DiPiero and Chris Wallin, respectively, while Rutherford and DiPiero co-wrote \"If You Ever Stop Loving Me\" with Tom Shapiro. In October 2005, \"You Do Your Thing\" became the duo's third platinum album. Rick Bell gave the album a favorable review on \"Country Standard Time\", saying that the duo \"unleash [Southern rock] in a torrent of brash lyrics, wailing guitars, and pounding percussion.\" Jurek wrote that it \"is easily the finest outing by modern country's most relevant duo; it rocks, it's soulful, and it's memorable.\" Montgomery Gentry toured in late 2004 – early 2005 with Trace Adkins in support of the album.\n\n\"Something to Be Proud Of\" also served as the title track to Montgomery Gentry's first greatest hits album, \"\". Also included on this disc were \"Didn't I\", \"Merry Christmas from the Family\" and the new song \"She Don't Tell Me To\" (also co-written by Rutherford, Shapiro, and DiPiero), which peaked at number 5 on the country charts in early 2006. \"Something to Be Proud Of\" was certified gold.\n\n\"Some People Change\" was the title of Montgomery Gentry's fifth album, which was released in 2006 under the production of Rutherford and Wright. Its title track, co-written by Neil Thrasher, Jason Sellers, and Michael Dulaney, was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album \"When the Sun Goes Down\". Gentry told the \"Edmonton Sun\" that \"Some People Change\" \"is based more on family issues, the love of the family, the love of neighbors, relationships\", and said that the title track \"is about being able to challenge your inner demons and the things that can bring people down, alcoholism, or hatred or racism.\" Montgomery Gentry's version of the song peaked at number 7, followed by the two-week number 1 hit \"Lucky Man\" and the number 3 \"What Do Ya Think About That\". In 2008, \"Lucky Man\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the duo's first Grammy nomination.\n\n\"Some People Change\" was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, thought that the album's poor sales were because it \"strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I think we got a little too soft.\" Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" gave a mixed review, saying that it was more \"touchy-feely\" than \"You Do Your Thing\", and that \"no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry\". Chris Willman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a \"C\", criticizing the duo for the contradictory viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the \"defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors\" in \"What Do Ya Think About That\". Jurek comparatively called it a \"masterpiece\" and said that it was \"a new pinnacle for the duo\", calling the title track \"one of those tunes that defines something that lies at the heart of what is good about Americans.\"\n\nIn 2008, the duo went to the Ardent studios in Memphis, Tennessee to record their sixth album, \"Back When I Knew It All\". Once again, they worked with Blake Chancey as producer. This album's title track, co-written by Trent Willmon, was the duo's fastest-climbing single. Both it and followup \"Roll with Me\", which included a backing vocal from Five for Fighting, went to number 1. \"One in Every Crowd\", co-written by Montgomery with Kim Tribble and former Trick Pony bassist Ira Dean, was issued in January 2009 as the third single. By the middle of the year, this song peaked at number 5. The fourth single, the number 23 \"Long Line of Losers\", was co-written and previously recorded by Kevin Fowler. Toby Keith, with whom Montgomery Gentry toured in mid-2008, contributed a guest vocal on the Terri Clark co-write \"I Pick My Parties\", and Lillie Mae Rische of Jypsi made an appearance on \"God Knows Who I Am\". Thom Jurek wrote of this album, \"The hardcore fans will love it, but this isn't the album that will win over many new ones.\"\n\nOn May 26, 2009, Montgomery Gentry was formally invited by Charlie Daniels to become members of the Grand Ole Opry. Marty Stuart and Little Jimmy Dickens inducted them on June 23. Also in May 2009, Cracker Barrel restaurants released an exclusive compilation titled \"For Our Heroes\", which included some of their hits along with \"Didn't I\" and three other songs which had previously been released only as bonus tracks. The restaurant chain donated a portion of all profits from the album to the Wounded Warrior Project.\n\nOn November 30, 2009, Montgomery Gentry released the single \"Oughta Be More Songs About That\". It was to have been included on an album titled \"Freedom\", which was to have included a song that the two wrote with Gary Hannan and Phil O'Donnell titled \"Freedom Never Goes Out of Style\". The label scrapped \"Freedom\" and instead chose to release an extended play titled \"Hits and More: Life Beside a Gravel Road\", which would have included past hits and three new songs. Its first single, \"While You're Still Young\", peaked at number 32 in mid-2010. On September 17, 2010, a day before the extended play's slated release, Montgomery Gentry exited the label, and \"Hits and More\" was shelved. Both members told \"Country Weekly\" that they decided to leave Columbia because \"there were so many people trying to encourage us to do something a little different musically. Some of it worked and some of it didn't.\"\n\nMontgomery Gentry signed to Average Joes Entertainment, a label co-owned by country rap artist Colt Ford, in March 2011. Their first release for the label, \"Where I Come From\", appears on their seventh album \"Rebels on the Run\", released on October 18. The album was produced by Michael Knox, who also produces for Jason Aldean. Jurek thought that the album was \"the most consistent offering\" since \"Some People Change\" \"even if it doesn't quite scale those heights\", and \"Country Weekly\" reviewer Jessica Nicholson called it \"classic Montgomery Gentry\". In early 2012, \"Where I Come From\" peaked at number 8 on the country charts. It was followed by \"So Called Life\", which failed to make Top 40.\n\nOn October 23, 2012, the duo released a digital-only EP titled \"Friends and Family.\" The EP contains four tracks, including \"I'll Keep the Kids\", which was released as a single.\n\nThe duo spent the better part of 2012 and 2013 touring. They signed to Blaster Records in February 2014 and announced that a new album, to be produced by Michael Knox, would be released within the year. However, the album's lead single, titled \"Headlights\", did not perform as expected on the charts, peaking at number 44 on Country Airplay. As a result, the album's release was delayed. The album's second single \"Folks Like Us\", was released to country radio in March 2015. \"Folks Like Us\" was released on June 9, 2015.\n\nIn November 2016, the duo left Blaster Records and re-signed with Average Joes Entertainment. They began working on a new album, then slated for a 2017 release. Following Gentry's death on September 8, 2017, the label announced that the duo had completed their new album prior to the fatal helicopter crash. \"Better Me,\" the lead single, was released on September 15, 2017. In November 2017, the album's title \"Here's to You\" was announced, as was its release date of February 2, 2018. Eddie Montgomery has confirmed that he will continue the Montgomery Gentry name as a solo act due to Troy Gentry's death and he plans to tour in 2018 in support of the new album. On November 16, Average Joes issued the new compilation \"20 Years of Hits\", which includes new re-recordings of the duo's biggest hits that were completed before Gentry's death. This was followed in 2019 by the studio album \"Outskirts\", a seven-song compilation recorded a week prior to Gentry's death. Produced by Noah Gordon and Shannon Houchins, the album includes a cover of Merle Haggard's 1983 hit \"What Am I Gonna Do (With the Rest of My Life)\" and Darrell Scott's \"You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive\". Later in the year, the label released a deluxe version with additional songs. At the time of the album's release, Montgomery said that he planned to continue touring under the Montgomery Gentry name even after Gentry's death, and that he wanted to honor Gentry by releasing songs that they had worked on prior.\n\nMontgomery Gentry's sound was defined by Southern rock influences. Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the duo \"evokes the sound and spirit of Southern rockers like Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Marshall Tucker Band, and Charlie Daniels, painting themselves as rowdy redneck rebels who still hold small-town values.\" They cite Daniels, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams, Jr. as primary musical influences. Montgomery and Gentry alternated as lead vocalists, with Gentry often accompanying on acoustic guitar. Jurek wrote that \"Montgomery's rough hewn baritone and Gentry's almost unreal range and trademark phrasing make something highly original\". In his book \"Country\", Richard Carlin describes Montgomery Gentry as \"rock[ing] harder than Brooks & Dunn, although their music could be seen as an extension of that successful pair's boot-scootin' sound.\" He also wrote that Gentry sings with a \"sweet, high tenor\" while Montgomery \"complements with an earthy, sometimes raspy, baritone\", and notes that the duo has an \"energetic stage show and dress\".\n\nMany of the duo's mid-tempo songs, such as \"My Town\", centralized on a theme of rural lifestyles. Others, such as \"You Do Your Thing\" and \"Some People Change\", contained messages of tolerance towards others with differing opinions.\n\nGerald Edward \"Eddie\" Montgomery was born in Danville, Kentucky, on September 30, 1963, to parents Carol Dean (née Lay) and Harold Edward Montgomery (1941–1994).\n\nIn November 2010, Eddie Montgomery told Great American Country that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The cancer was successfully removed a month later. The same month, his wife, Tracy Nunan Montgomery, announced their divorce, serving him papers at Eddie Montgomery's Steakhouse, a restaurant he owned in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The restaurant closed abruptly in Spring 2013. The couple had four children and had been married for over 20 years. Montgomery posted to Twitter and Facebook that she divorced him because she did not want to \"cope with his illness\", but she subsequently denied it. Montgomery subsequently married his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Belcher, in 2014. On September 27, 2015, Montgomery wrote that his and ex-wife Tracy Nunan's 19-year-old son, Hunter, had been killed in an accident. Nunan subsequently clarified that Hunter died of an overdose, which she believed was accidental.\n\nMontgomery's nephew, Dillon Carmichael, is also a country music singer.\n\nTroy Gentry was born on April 5, 1967, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Patricia (née Webb; 1942–2007) and Lloyd Gentry (1934–2017) He had a brother, Keith Gentry, and a sister, Jana Gentry Eckhardt. Troy graduated from Lexington Community College and attended the University of Kentucky. Gentry married Angie McClure in 1999. They had a child, Kaylee, who was born in November 2002. He also had a child, Taylor, from a previous marriage. He was not related to Teddy Gentry, bass guitarist for Alabama.\n\nIn 2004, Gentry purchased a black bear named \"Cubby\" from a facility called the Minnesota Wildlife Connection and subsequently shot the bear from inside an electrified enclosure, a practice commonly known as canned hunting. On November 27, 2006, Gentry pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely tagging a bear that was killed in a fenced enclosure as if it had been killed in the wild. Under the plea agreement, he agreed to pay a $15,000 fine, give up hunting, fishing and trapping in Minnesota for five years and forfeit Cubby's taxidermied remains and the bow he used to shoot Cubby. In a statement that he posted on the duo's website on November 9, 2010, he apologized for his actions as well as the unethical manner in which he killed Cubby.\nOn September 8, 2017, Gentry died in a helicopter crash while taking a helicopter tour of Medford, New Jersey, where he and Montgomery were set to perform that evening. Through social media, the band released the following statement: \"It is with great sadness that we confirm that Troy Gentry, half of the popular country duo, Montgomery Gentry, was tragically killed in a helicopter crash which took place at approximately 1:00 p.m. today in Medford, New Jersey.\" On September 14, 2017, a public memorial service for Gentry was held at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. On November 5, 2018, the final National Transportation Safety Board report was issued, with the accident being primarily attributed to the pilot's \"\" failure to maintain rotor rpm... which resulted in an uncontrolled descent.\"\"\n\n\n"}

He served as Deputy Counsel to President Richard M. Nixon from 1969–70, and assisted both Nixon and Ronald Reagan in their presidential campaigns.\n\nSears was born in July 1940 near Syracuse, New York, the son of James L. Sears and Helen M. Fitzgerald. Sears attended Christian Brothers Academy in suburban Syracuse, a private Catholic preparatory academy. He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Notre Dame (B.S.,1960), and completed law school at Georgetown University (L.L.B., J.D., 1963); both universities are among the most prominent Catholic colleges in the United States.\n\nSears worked as a law clerk for the New York State Court of Appeals from 1963-65.\n\nHe then became a member of the New York City law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Alexander, Guthrie & Mitchell for two years. He met Richard M. Nixon as a colleague at this firm; at the time Nixon was a former congressman, senator, and vice-president, and unsuccessful presidential and gubernatorial candidate, working as a lawyer in private practice.\n\nHe then joined Nixon's political staff, as Nixon was preparing a bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. Sears played a pivotal role at the 1968 Republican National Convention, in securing Richard Nixon's nomination for the presidency. He was only 28 at the time and was subsequently shut out of the Nixon campaign operation by John Mitchell (a partner from his law firm), who considered him overly ambitious. Mitchell, who became U.S. Attorney general during the first Nixon term, was subsequently caught up as a central figure in the Watergate scandal, from 1972 to 1974.\n\nSears served as Deputy Counsel to the President from 1969-70.\n\nSears then left the White House, to join the law firm of Gadsby & Hannah, in Washington, DC, where he worked from 1970-76. He has been a partner in the Washington law firm of Baskin and Sears since 1977.\n\nSears managed Ronald Reagan's 1976 presidential bid, when Reagan ran in the Republican primaries against incumbent President Gerald Ford, and almost won the nomination.\n\nHe again managed Reagan's presidential bid in 1980 but was fired and replaced by William Casey on the day Reagan won the New Hampshire primary. Sears had run the national operation out of Washington and was a rival of Edwin Meese, Michael Deaver, and Lyn Nofziger in California. They did not trust Sears and believed he was trying to consolidate power at the expense of many longtime Reagan friends and backers.\nReagan told journalist and presidential scholar Theodore White that \"There was a feeling that I was just kind of a spokesman for John Sears.\" Sears had been attempting to consolidate power in the Reagan campaign in 1980. He overstepped his bounds, leading to his firing. William Casey was hired to take his place. Casey (later appointed to head the Central Intelligence Agency by President Reagan) demanded administrative control of the campaign, but had no desire to control policy and by extension the personnel choices of the Reagan campaign; this was something John Sears was boldly attempting to control.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sears was \"the highest paid\" American lobbyist for South Africa's apartheid regime, \"commanding an annual fee of $500,000.\"\n\nIn 2000 Leonard Garment incorrectly identified Sears as Deep Throat in his book \"In Search of Deep Throat\". Sears then requested that Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein (who unmasked Watergate with the help of Deep Throat) publicly deny it was him, and Bernstein complied. (Later it was revealed by Woodward that W. Mark Felt, former Deputy FBI Director was \"Deep Throat\".)\n\nSears served as a political analyst for NBC Today, the popular television broadcast, from 1984-85. He resided in McLean, Virginia. Sears died in Miami on March 26, 2020, from a heart attack.\n\n"}

It is her personal account of her experiences during the Khmer Rouge regime.\nUntil the age of five, Loung Ung lived in Phnom Penh, one of seven children of a high-ranking government official. She was a precocious child who loved the open city markets, fried crickets, chicken fights and sassing her parents. While her beautiful mother worried that Loung was a troublemaker, her beloved father knew Loung was a clever girl.\n\nWhen Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge army captured Phnom Penh in April 1975, Ung's family fled their home and moved from village to village to hide their identity, their education, their former life of privilege. Eventually, the family dispersed in order to survive. Because Loung was resilient and determined, she trained as a child soldier in a work camp for orphans while other siblings were sent to labor camps. As the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge, the surviving siblings were slowly reunited. Bolstered by the shocking bravery of one brother, the vision of the others and sustained by her sister's gentle kindness amid brutality, Loung forged herself a new life.\n\nThe book was harshly criticized by Sody Lay, co-founder of the Khmer Institute Website, for historical inaccuracies and cultural inauthenticity. Reflecting on this negative review in an article for The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States, Dr. Bunkong Tuon acknowledged the criticisms of Sody Lay's review, but defended Ung's work. Instead of dismissing Ung's text outright, the article argued that scholars should read \"First They Killed My Father\" not to garner historical facts about the Khmer Rouge, but rather to experience its emotional truth and to consider its subjective, narrative gaps and fissures as a signifier of trauma and a testament to the destruction perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge.\n\nThe book has been adapted into a movie that was produced and directed by Angelina Jolie. The film premiered on February 18, 2017 in Siem Reap, Cambodia.\n\n\"The heart of it is Loung's story\", Jolie states on the film. \"It's the story of a war through the eyes of a child, but it is also the story of a country\". To construct an accurate portrait of the genocide and war, Jolie used only Cambodian actors who speak their native language, Khmer. She gathered hundreds of survivors and their children to re-create their stories. The movie was filmed in Cambodia.\n\n"}

Starting from the end of the 14th century, \"volost\" was a unit of administrative division in Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Poland, Muscovy, lands of modern Latvia and Ukraine. Since about the 16th century it was a part of provincial districts, that were called \"uyezd\" in Muscovy and the later Russian Empire. Each uyezd had several volosts that were subordinated to the uyezd city.\n\nAfter the abolition of Russian serfdom in 1861, \"volost\" became a unit of peasant's local self-rule. A number of mirs are united into a volost, which has an assembly consisting of elected delegates from the mirs. These elect an elder (\"starshina\") and, hitherto, a court of justice (\"volostnoy sud\"). The self-government of the mirs and volosts was, however, tempered by the authority of the police commissaries (\"stanovoi\") and by the power of general oversight given to the nominated \"district committees for the affairs of the peasants\".\n\nVolosts were abolished by the Soviet administrative reform of 1923–1929. Raions may be roughly called a modern equivalent of both volosts and uyezds.\n\nVolosts were governed by volost administration (, \"volostnoye pravleniye\"), which consisted of the electable chief of volost (\"volostnoy starshina\"), chiefs of villages (village \"starostas\") and other officials electable by the Volost Assembly (волостной сход, \"volostnoy skhod\").\n\nVolost Court was the court electable by the Volost Assembly, which could handle smaller civil and criminal cases. It could sentence people to corporal punishment, fine or short-term incarceration.\n\nIn modern Russia the term has a different meaning. The subdivision into volosts is used in the Republic of Karelia, where volosts have the same status as raions, and in Leningrad, Pskov, Samara, and Tula Oblasts, where volosts are considered subdivisions of raions and have the same status as selsovets in other Russian federal subjects.\n\n"}

{"id": "1974450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974450", "title": "Battle of Río Salado", "text": "Battle of Río Salado\n\nThe Battle of Río Salado, also known as the Battle of Tarifa (30 October 1340) was a battle of the armies of King Afonso IV of Portugal and King Alfonso XI of Castile against those of Sultan Abu al-Hasan 'Ali of the Marinid dynasty and Yusuf I of Granada.\n\nAfter his defeat at the Battle of Teba in 1330, Muhammed IV, Sultan of Granada sent to Abu al-Hasan 'Ali of Morocco for help in maintaining his survival. Hasan sent a naval fleet and 5,000 troops that landed at Algeciras in early 1333. These set about helping the Granadan King to capture the Castilian outpost of Gibraltar, which he did after less than two months. They then conducted a limited campaign to reunite these territories to the realm of Granada. Back in Magreb, Abu Hasan amassed his biggest army to undertake an invasion of Castile with the intention of undoing the previous century's Christian advances.\n\nThis invasion was a final attempt by the Marinids to set up a power base in the Iberian Peninsula. The Marinids had mobilised a vast army and, after crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and defeating a Christian fleet at Gibraltar, proceeded inland to the Salado River near Tarifa, where they met the Christians.\n\nDuring the winter of 1340, Abu Hasan gathered his fleet: 60 war galleys and 250 other ships concentrated at Ceuta under command of Muhammad ibn Ali al-Azafi. They landed an army at Gibraltar, and on 8 April 1340 44 Muslim galleys and 35 \"leños\" met the Castilian fleet of 44 galleys and 7 \"naos\", under Admiral Alfonso Jofre de Tenorio, in the straits. Al-Azafi surrounded and destroyed the Castilian fleet; Tenorio himself lost his life, 28 galleys and seven \"naos\" were captured and only 11 of his galleys managed to reach Cartagena. Five reached Tarifa.\n\nAbu Hasan crossed the Gibraltar straits on 14 August 1340, and all through the summer troops and supplies were ferried across to the Peninsula. On 22 September the siege of Tarifa was formally established, with the help of Yusuf I. However the Sultan made a serious mistake: believing it would take many months for the Castilians to rebuild a fleet, and in the hope of cutting down the enormous cost of maintaining his own fleet, Abu Hasan prematurely laid up most of his galleys and returned those of his allies, leaving only 12 at Algeciras.\n\nMeanwhile, Alfonso XI had sought the aid of the King of Aragón and of his father-in-law, King Afonso IV of Portugal. The latter sent a Portuguese naval fleet led by Manuel Pessanha, Admiral of Portugal, and additionally paid for the services of 15 Genoese galleys led by commander Micer Gil Bocanegra. With the addition of 27 ships hastily completed at Seville, the Christian fleets appeared in force in the Straits in October, cutting off the supply routes between Morocco and the Peninsula.\n\nAbu Hasan's position was now a difficult one, not only because the troops besieging Tarifa depended on supplies from Morocco, but also the Kingdom of Granada needed them, their forces having launched a series of limited attacks all along the frontier to hold the Castilians at bay. On 10 October, a severe storm wrecked 12 Castilian galleys, and the same day the Sultan launched an all-out assault against Tarifa, which was barely repulsed with heavy losses on both sides.\n\nAlfonso XI left Seville on 15 October 1340 with a relief army, joining the King of Portugal the next day. They advanced to the line of the Guadalete River and there awaited further Castilian and Portuguese contingents. At last on 26 October the combined army, now 20,000-strong, crossed into enemy territory. When informed of their advance, Abu Hasan ordered the siege raised and his army took position on a hill between Tarifa and the sea. Yusuf I placed his army on an adjacent hill. On the 29th the Christian army reached the Deer Hill (Hayar al-Ayyal), from Tarifa and barely 250 metres from the beach. Between them and their adversaries was a 4,500m long valley crossed by the streams of La Jara and El Salado. With supplies running low, Alfonso XI decided to attack the next day.\n\nDuring the night, Alfonso XI had sent 1,000 horse and 4,000 foot troops to reinforce the Tarifa garrison, hoping to surprise the enemy rearguard during the battle; they had met only slight resistance by the 3,000 light cavalry covering the Salado and reached Tarifa without difficulty. However, the officer commanding the light cavalry informed Abu Hasan that not a single Christian had managed to enter Tarifa during the night; whether he made his report in good faith, or in fear of admitting failure will never be known, but this omission had serious consequences the next day.\n\nA Spanish contemporary chronicle estimated Abu Hasan's army at 40,000 knights and 400,000 infantry; figures regarded as grossly inflated by Callaghan. Another account put forth 53,000 knights and 600,000 infantry for the Moors. A third chronicler postulated 70,000 knights and 400,000 infantry for the Marinids and 7,000 knights and 700,000 infantry for Granada. Archbishop Gil de Albornoz asserted a strength of 40,000 knights and 400,000 infantry for the combined Muslim force. The lowest figure is provided by Rodrigo Yánez's account, claiming that Abu Hasan deployed 60,000 men and that transporting the force across the Straits of Gibraltar took four months. Yánez's estimate is dismissed by Callaghan. The 17th century historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, relying on an earlier text, also estimated 60,000 men as Abu Hasan's force. Granada had 7,000 knights and the Marinids may have mobilized up to 60,000 men. A Christian militia probably fought for the Emir of Granada at the battle. One Marinid prince fought on the Castilian side.\n\nThe Castilians mustered 8,000 knights and 12,000 infantry. The Portuguese brought 1,000 knights and Tarifa kept a garrison of 1,000 men, who took part in the battle. Alfonso sent 3,000 Castilian knights to help the 1,000 Portuguese knights attack Yusuf's 7,000 Granadan knights on the left. The Castilian infantry consisted of municipal militias, stationed in the middle, and soldiers from Asturias and the Basque territories, who were armed and equipped with lances, crossbows, helmets, and shields and were located next to Afonso IV's knights.\n\nThe council of war decided that the Castilian King would attack the Sultan's main army, while the Portuguese host, reinforced by 3,000 Castilians, would engage Yusuf I. At nine o'clock on the morning of 30 October 1340 they moved out of camp, leaving 2,000 raw militia to guard it. The strong Castilian vanguard was led by the Lara brothers, while the King himself rode in the main body. On the left were the missile troops from the Kingdom of León, led by Pedro Nuñez, and on the right Alvar Pérez de Guzmán with a cavalry corps. Reinforcing the Portuguese forces were the Military Orders of Alcántara and Calatrava.\n\nAbu Hasan had left the Jara crossing uncontested, but he deployed strong forces along the Salado. The Castilian vanguard met serious resistance; de Lara was unable to cross the shallow river, but the King's natural sons Fernando and Fadrique led an 800-knight detachment towards the right and captured a small bridge, pushing back the 2,500 cavalry defending it. Alfonso reinforced them with 1,500 more knights and the Salado was successfully crossed.\n\nIn the center, Juan Núñez de Lara and the Military Order of Santiago with 3,000 knights finally smashed through the enemy line and crossed too, riding hard up the hill where Abu Hasan's camp was clearly visible. The forces hidden in Tarifa also attacked the Sultan's camp at the same time, and the troops defending it (about 3,000 horse and 8,000 foot) withdrew, half of them fleeing towards Algeciras and the other half joining the main struggle in the valley, where the Sultan's army was still largely intact.\n\nAlfonso now found himself dangerously isolated, with the right wing at some distance and the vanguard attacking the enemy camp. Abu Hasan ordered a general attack and the Castilian King himself was about to engage in hand-to-hand combat when the Archbishop of Toledo, Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz, grabbed his reins and prevented it. The timely arrival of the Castilian rearguard balanced the situation, and when the forces which had been sacking the Sultan's camp advanced down the hill and engaged the enemy from the rear, Abu Hasan's surrounded army broke and fled towards Algeciras.\nMeanwhile, the Portuguese contingent had crossed the Salado, and when Pedro Nuñez reinforced them the whole Granada contingent broke and left the field. The battle took just three hours from 9 a.m. until noon.\n\nThe pursuit was ruthless, ending at the Guadamecí River, 6 km from the battlefield, although many remained in the hills, sacking the Sultan's rich camp. Little mercy was shown here, and many of the Sultan's wives were killed, including his first wife Fatimah (daughter of the Sultan of Tunis) and Aysa (daughter of the noble Abu Yahya ibn Yaqub). Other kinfolk of Abu Hasan were taken captive, including his sister Umalfat, his son Abu Umar Tasufin, and his nephew Alí. Many notables were killed in the battle or the rout, such as Abu Tabit ibn Fath Allah, Abu Muyahid Gazi ibn al-Ka's, and Muhammad ben Yahya ben Abi Bakr, also the famous writer from Granada, Abdullah ben Salmun, and the popular imam Ibn al-Khatib.\n\nBoth Abu Hasan and Yusuf reached Algeciras; the Sultan took refuge at Gibraltar, and that same night crossed to Ceuta in a galley.\n\nThe Marinids had suffered a decisive defeat and moved back to Africa.\n\nNever again was a Muslim army able to invade the Iberian Peninsula. Control of the Straits of Gibraltar was now held by the Christians, specifically the Castilians and the Genoese. The war with Granada continued for ten more years during which Alfonso XI made a few small territorial gains from the western part of Granada. Most importantly, the town of Algeciras, a valuable bridgehead held by the Marinids was finally retaken after a two-year siege in 1344. This siege attracted volunteers from all over Europe due to extensive publicity. An attempt to recapture Gibraltar from the King of Granada was frustrated, however Castile had to settle for isolation of the citadel from the rest of Muslim territory when peace was agreed in 1350, after the death of Alfonso XI in his camp during the Great Plague. Gibraltar was not captured until 1462.\n\n"}

The version with the original lyrics is the fourth track on \"Use Your Illusion I\", while the version with the alternate lyrics is the 13th track on \"Use Your Illusion II\". Only the vocal tracks differ, and even then only in the verses; however, in those verses, not only are the words entirely different, but the meter and melody are also slightly different. There is also a third version, officially released only on the single for the song, which was recorded during \"Appetite for Destruction\" sessions in 1986. \n\nThe song reached the top 10 in many countries, including peaking at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number 10 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In Ireland \"Don't Cry\" became Guns N' Roses' second number-one single, and in Finland it became the second number-one hit from the \"Use Your Illusion\" albums. Additionally, the song reached number two in New Zealand and Norway and peaked within the top five in Australia, Denmark and Switzerland.\n\nStradlin and Rose wrote the song (with the working title \"Don't You Cry Tonight\") in March 1985, shortly after Guns N' Roses was formed in Los Angeles. In the Special Collector’s Edition of \"Rolling Stone\" dedicated to the band, Kory Grow quotes Rose:\n\nAfter a low guitar drone, the song evolves into a hard rock lullaby that turns into a hard-hearted kiss-off, ending with an edgy, sustained vocal drone that is more scary than reassuring. In his book \"Over the Top: The True Story of Guns N' Roses\", Mark Putterford notes the song's contrast with much of the other material on the \"Illusion\" albums, citing Rose's \"deeply ingrained whore/madonna dichotomy\" and his \"dew-eyed romantic cooing with tenderness.\" \"Don't Cry\" features Shannon Hoon of Blind Melon as a co-lead vocalist. Hoon sings an octave higher than Rose, and his voice is placed further back in the mix. In his autobiography, Slash states that Hoon's harmony vocal \"made that song all the more soulful.\" Along with \"Estranged\" and \"November Rain,\" it forms a narrative inspired in part by the short story \"Without You\" by Del James. The song peaked at #10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the band's fifth Top 10 hit there.\n\nThe official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan and Mark Racco. John Linson was the producer of the video.\n\nRose commented on the difficulty of filming the video and how certain scenes inspired by his relationship with Erin Everly affected him emotionally:\nIzzy Stradlin had left the band by the time the band came to film the video and therefore does not appear in the video for the song he co-wrote. A fan can be seen holding up a sign saying 'Where's Izzy' in the video. Stradlin later deemed the multi-million dollar video \"a pointless indulgence.\"\n\n\"Don't Cry\" was performed quite frequently during the early tours and the Use Your Illusion Tour. It was absent from the early legs (i.e. 2001–02) of the Chinese Democracy Tour but reappeared to an extent in 2006, as guitarist Bumblefoot began using an instrumental version of the song as a guitar solo spot. In 2007, during the Bumblefoot solo spot, Axl came on stage to sing along to the solo on two occasions, marking the first times since 1993 that Axl had sung it live.\n\n\"Don't Cry\" made another return during the 2009/2010 World Tour, with Axl singing along with the solo spot on each occasion that it has been played.\n\nA recording of the song from the Tokyo Dome was released on the album Live Era '87–'93 and a VHS/DVD.\n\nCD single \n\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n"}

Gruit or grut ale may also refer to the beverage produced using gruit.\n\nHistorically, \"gruit\" is the term used in an area today covered by the Netherlands, Belgium and westernmost Germany. Today however, \"gruit\" is a colloquial term for any beer seasoned with gruit-like herbs.\n\nGruit was and is a combination of herbs, commonly including sweet gale (\"Myrica gale\"), mugwort (\"Artemisia vulgaris\"), yarrow (\"Achillea millefolium\"), ground ivy (\"Glechoma hederacea\"), horehound (\"Marrubium vulgare\"), and Calluna heather (\"Calluna vulgaris\"). Gruit varied somewhat, each gruit producer including different herbs to produce unique flavors and effects. Other adjunct herbs include juniper berries, ginger, caraway seed, aniseed, nutmeg, cinnamon, mint and occasionally hops in variable proportions (although gruit today is often sought out for lacking hops).\n\nThe word \"gruit\" stems from an area now in the Netherlands, Belgium and westernmost Germany. Here, the sale of gruit was a monopoly held by various local authorities, and as such a de facto tax on beer. The word \"gruit\" could refer to the herb mixture itself or the monopoly of its sale. The earliest reference to gruit dates from the late 10th century, and although largely replaced by hops in the 14th and 15th century, gruit beer was locally produced in Westphalia up to the 17th century.\n\nOutside the area where the gruit monopoly applied, other countries and regions produced ales containing spices, but they were not named gruit. For instance, some traditional types of unhopped beer such as sahti in Finland, which is spiced with juniper berries and twigs, have survived the advent of hops.\n\nIn both the area where gruit existed and outside it, the traditional spices were gradually replaced by hops, in a slow sweep across Europe occurring between the 11th century (in the south and east of the Holy Roman Empire) and the late 16th century (Great Britain). In 16th century Britain, a distinction was made between ale, which was unhopped, and beer, brought by Dutch merchants, which was hopped. Currently, however, ale usually refers to beer produced through a top-fermentation process, not unhopped beer.\n\nThe main factor for the replacement of spices by hops is that hops were cheaper (especially in the gruit area, where the price of beer flavouring spices was artificially kept high) and were better at rendering the beer keepable. This preservative effect is thought to have had a large impact on the early movement to switch over, although other plants commonly used in gruit mixes, for example sage, rosemary or bog myrtle, also have antiseptic properties likely to extend the shelf life of beer.\n\nSpruce tips as a local food ingredient has a practical aspect as well; it is a plentiful resource in northern latitudes like Alaska, whereas hops must be imported from the lower 48 United States.\n\nThe 1990s microbrewery movement in North America and Europe saw a renewed interest in unhopped beers and several have tried their hand at reviving ales brewed with gruits, or plants that once were used in it. Commercial examples include:\nSince 2013, craft brewers with an interest in making gruit ales have banded together to mark February 1 as International Gruit Day.

It also contains a collection of essays by ex-Muslims recounting their own experience in leaving the Islamic religion.\n\n\"Leaving Islam\" is divided into four parts, contains a preface and five appendices.\n\nThe first part of the book presents an overview of the theological-juridical underpinnings of apostasy in Islam based upon the Qur’an, the hadiths and written opinions from classical schools of Islamic jurisprudence, as well as contemporary written pronouncements of Islamic jurists.\n\nThe next section presents the history of the application of Islamic jurisprudence on apostates, documenting notable cases from the early centuries of Islam, such as those of freethinkers Ibn al-Rawandi and Rhazes (865–925), or skeptical poets such as Omar Khayyam (1048–1131) and Hafiz (1320–89), or Sufi (mystic) practitioners Mansur Al-Hallaj (executed in 922), As-Suhrawardi (executed in 1191), and the skeptic al-Ma'arri (973–1057).\n\nPart 2 consists of numerous case studies, covering modern-day apostasies, and conversions-out-of-Islam trends throughout the world. These were submitted to the website of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society (ISIS), co-founded by Ibn Warraq.\n\nThe third part contains testimonies of Muslim-raised apostates, including the ex-Muslim Ali Sina. According to Sina, it is no longer sufficient to simply not believe anymore, but \"it is our duty to expose Islam, to write about Muhammad's depraved lifestyle, about his shameful acts and his foolish claims.\" Many of the authors are from Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where a strict version of Islam dominates society, even though the lingua franca isn't Arabic, and these authors only discovered the real meaning of the texts after reading translations of the Quran, hadith and other early Islamic writings when they moved to the West.\n\nThe last part is about people born in the West who were not raised as Muslims, but converted to Islam in later life, and then deconverted out of Islam again.\n\nThe appendix \"Islam on Trial: The Textual Evidence\" cites, amongst other scriptural sources, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 84, Number 57: \"Whoever changes his religion, kill him.\"\n\nOn 24 June 2003, Ibn Warraq held a public lecture (in disguise, to protect his identity) in Cambridge, Massachusetts about the book and the context in which it was composed. He cited several of his co-authors and other ex-Muslims who decided to leave the faith for a variety of reasons, but stated that these people rarely dared to speak out for themselves, and non-Muslims such as Western publishers often refused to grant them a platform out of fear. Unlike himself however, Warraq said he was surprised that many co-authors, especially the women (whose stories he thought readers would \"find the most moving\"), were prepared to write their testimonies under their real names rather than pseudonyms.\n\nIn a July 2003 interview with \"The Religion Report\" on Australia's ABC Radio National, Warraq said he wrote \"Leaving Islam\" to support his claim that there were a large number of ex-Muslims and to encourage other Muslims to openly leave Islam. He also said his target audience with the book was not just Muslims but everyone.\n\nAside from giving Muslim apostates a voice, Warraq also conveyed his idea that ex-Muslims should take the lead in criticising Islam and Islamism. As former Muslims, they have experienced Islam from within, and know it better than critics from outside, and perhaps can speak about it with more authority. To support this, Warraq compared 1930s Bolshevism and 1990s Islamism, and modern-day ex-Muslims to ex-communists from the 1930s, referencing Arthur Koestler's statement to his formerly fellow communists: \"You hate our Cassandra cries and resent us as allies, but when all is said, we ex-Communists are the only people on your side who know what it's all about.\"\n\nSome weeks before publication, a few writings taken from \"Leaving Islam\" were made available online on the website of Warraq's Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society. Reviewing these previews for Dutch daily newspaper \"Trouw\", scholar of Islam Hans Jansen noted that, although \"not all of the testimonies are written down in equally pretty English\", he accepted this consequence of the world wide web being accessible around the globe and users with other native languages now able to communicate in unprecedented ways that censorship would previously prevent. \"For the first time in history, Muslims will have unrestrained access to anti-Islamic polemics. The rule, applying in all Islamic countries, that only Islam may enter the marketplace of new religious ideas, has definitively come to an end due to the Internet, and Ibn Warraq.\"\n\n\"The New York Review of Books\" commented that \"Leaving Islam\" is \"probably the first book of its kind — a compendium of testimonies from former Muslims about their estrangement from the Islamic faith.\" Finding the personal stories widely varying in quality (\"from the tragic to the trite\"), it remarked that the \"long and illustrious history of Muslim doubt\" in the book's first part was most informative.\n\nAccording to \"The Boston Globe\", \"\"Leaving Islam\"'s stories make eye-opening reading.\"\n\nWhen a Dutch translation by Bernadette de Wit (with a foreword by Afshin Ellian) was published in 2008, \"de Volkskrant\" found the book \"interesting, because it shows how the process of deconversion occurs in Muslim migrants.\" On the other hand, there was an apparent inconsistency in the authors' attitude towards the Abrahamic holy books. They agreed that both the Quran and the Bible described many atrocities and contained a lot of immoral commandments, but while modern Christians and Jews were praised for cherry-picking the good bits and ignoring the unethical parts or taking them as parables, the contributors of \"Leaving Islam\" tended to claim that modern Muslims who try to do the same are blind to what the texts literally say, and should stop believing in them altogether.\n\n\"Trouw\" journalist Eildert Mulder noted that the ex-Muslims' testimonies had a lot in common with those of ex-Christians. However, the latter usually focus on attacking the churches, or recounting how they suffered from their Christian upbringing; they rarely target the character of Jesus: \"Criticism is restricted to the observation that one cannot walk on water, nor rise from the dead.\" In \"Leaving Islam\", Mulder read that \"Amongst deconverted Muslims, on the other hand, the aversion towards the prophet's personality \"is\" an important reason to break away from their religion. (...) The anger against Muhammad is enormous amongst apostates,\" especially concerning the oppression of women, human rights violations and mass murder. Although Warraq does discuss a few such cases in the book, Mulder criticised Warraq's website for featuring only ex-Muslim atheists and agnostics' excerpts from the book, and none from people who left Islam for another religion: \"This website is not dedicated to people who have exchanged one type of irrationality for another.\" Mulder concludes that the books' contributors are \"impressive, because these people have literally put their lives on the line.\"\n\nIn a similar book, \"The Apostates: When Muslims Leave Islam\" (2015), Simon Cottee challenged \"Leaving Islam\"'s assertion that the fact that the death penalty for apostasy is supported by several passages in the hadith, this means this reflects the 21st-century mainstream Muslim opinion on the matter.\n\n\n"}

Founded in Rome in 1945, it is known for its bespoke men's suits, sartorial ready-to-wear collections and leather goods.\nThroughout its history, the company has invented concepts such as the men's runway show, the trunk show, and the ready-to-wear Haute Couture.\n\nBrioni designs, develops and manufactures \"Su Misura\" garments and sartorial ready-to-wear collections as well as leather goods, shoes, eyewear and fragrance. Brioni products are distributed globally, encompassing Europe, Asia and America, through directly-owned boutiques and a network of department stores.\n\nOn 17 March 2017 Brioni announced the appointment of Fabrizio Malverdi as CEO, a month after Gianluca Flore stepped down from the role.\n\nBrioni was established in Rome in 1945 as a men's tailoring company by founders Nazareno Fonticoli, a tailor, and Gaetano Savini, an entrepreneur. They opened their first shop on Via Barberini 79, naming the brand after the formerly Italian Brionian Islands (now part of Croatia); the shop is still at the same address. Brioni quickly started to raise interest from high-profile movie business personalities, heads of state and business leaders.\n\nIn 1952, Brioni staged the first men’s fashion show in history, inside the Sala Bianca at Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The clothes introduced new silhouettes, bold colors and innovative fabrics, marking an important chapter for the company. A couple of years later, Brioni invented the trunk show, during which the collections were presented directly in stores, allowing customers to personalize the garments with the \"Su Misura\" service (made-to-measure).\n\nIn 1959, a production plant was opened in Penne, Abruzzo, birth town of Nazareno Fonticoli. Called Brioni Roman Style, the state-of-the-art factory introduced the concept of Prêt Couture, or ready-to-wear Haute Couture that sealed the international rise of the brand.\n\nIn 1985, the company opened a tailoring school in Penne with the aim of transmitting to younger generations the specific Brioni sartorial method.\nIn 2012, the group was acquired by French group Kering.\n\nBrioni's creative director from July 2012 to February 2016 was British-born Brendan Mullane. \n\nOn March 23, 2016, luxury conglomerate Kering announced that it had appointed Justin O’Shea, a heavily tattooed Australian and street-style enthusiast with more than 80,000 Instagram followers, as creative director. O’Shea was formerly the fashion director of the German e-commerce site MyTheresa. O’Shea featured the four members of Metallica dressed in Brioni tuxedos in his first ad campaign with the brand; the photos were shot by Zackery Michael. The remake of Brioni's logo under O'Shea by friend and frequent collaborator Benny Robinson has been compared to the Fraktur typeface. O'Shea showed his first collection for the house on 4 July 2016. \n\nIn early October 2016 Brioni announced that O'Shea would leave the brand. Brioni reported that its Autumn/Winter 2017 collection would be presented to buyers in the Milan showroom from mid-November 2016 but would not have a corresponding runway show. \n\nIn June 15, 2017, Nina-Maria Nitsche was appointed creative director. \n\nIn 2007 and 2011 The Luxury Institute ranked Brioni among the most prestigious men’s fashion luxury goods brands in America.\n\nAs of 2015, Brioni had 46 directly-operated retail stores.

This was a temporary measure to make policy decisions necessary to found and legitimise the new Colonial Government and to carry out the day-to-day affairs of the Government. With the arrival of Sir Arthur Gordon, on 1 September 1875, a permanent machinery for governing the new colony was established. In addition to the Executive Council, Gordon established a Legislative Council composed entirely of nominated members, of whom six were official (public officers, usually heads of Government departments), including the Governor of Fiji, the Colonial Secretary (the day-to-day executive power), the Chief Justice of Fiji and the Attorney General of Fiji; and four unofficial (representatives of the community not directly employed by the Government) members nominated by the Governor with the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Thus all ten members of the Legislative Council were Europeans.\n\nThe first step towards making the Council a popularly elected legislature was taken in 1904, when the council was reconstituted as a 19-member body consisting of the Governor, 10 official members appointed by the Governor, 6 elected members chosen by European males, and 2 Fijian members appointed by the Governor from a list of 6 nominees submitted by the Great Council of Chiefs. Persistent demands by Europeans led to an increase in their representation to seven in 1914.\n\nOn 20 July 1916, the composition of the Legislative Council was increased to twelve nominated members of whom eleven were official members and one a British subject not holding any such office, seven elected European members and two Fijian members. On 29 January 1917, Badril Maharaj, representing the Indian community, took the twelfth nominated seat in the Legislative Council. He served in the Legislative Council until 1923, when he resigned in opposition to the poll tax but was re-nominated in 1926 and stayed on as a member until 1929.\n\nOn 1 May 1929, the franchise was extended to Indian males twenty-one years of age and over who met the same income, residency, literacy and nationality qualifications as Europeans. The new Legislative Council consisted of the Governor as President, not more than thirteen official members, three nominated Fijian members, six elected Europeans and three elected Indians. Europeans and Indians were elected from separate communal rolls, while the Fijians were nominated from a panel of four to six names submitted by the Great Council of Chiefs.\n\nThe next major development took place in 1937, when the Legislative Council was enlarged to 32 members. Of these, 17 were official members appointed by the Governor. In addition, there were five non-official members from each of the three major ethnic groups (Fijians, Indo-Fijians, and Europeans); Indo-Fijians and Europeans directly elected 3 members each, with a further 2 being appointed by the Governor; all 5 Fijian representatives were appointed by the Governor from a list of ten names submitted by the Great Council of Chiefs. In 1954, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna was appointed the first Speaker of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn 1963, women were enfranchised and indigenous Fijians were empowered for the first time to vote directly for their representatives on the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council elected in 1963 had 37 members. There were 12 elected members, four from each of the Fijian, Indian and European groups chosen on a communal franchise. The Governor also nominated two from each of the communities. There were to be 19 official members. The Legislative Councillors of each race were permitted to select two from their fellows to the Executive Council. Qualifications to register as a voter disallowed illiterate adults to vote, permitted some people to choose between ethnic rolls and made no provision for Rotumans, Pacific Islanders, Chinese and Part-Chinese to vote.\n\nThe Legislative Council elected in 1966 had 36 members. 25 seats represented \"Communal constituencies\" (9 indigenous Fijians (Fijians and Pacific Islanders), 9 Indo-Fijians, and 7 General electors (Europeans, Chinese), elected on closed electoral rolls by voters registered as members of their respective ethnic groups. A further 9 members were elected from cross-voting (from 1972 referred to as \"National\") constituencies – seats allocated ethnically (3 for each ethnic constituency) but elected by universal suffrage. The remaining 2 members were nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs. The president of the Legislative Council was H. Maurice Scott.\n\nResponsible government was not introduced until 1967. A four-member Executive Council had existed from 1904, but it was not a Cabinet in the modern sense: it was appointed by the colonial Governor and responsible to him alone. The first step towards adoption of the Westminster System of responsible government was taken in 1964 with the adoption of the Member system, whereby 3 members of the Legislative Council (one from each ethnic constituency) were appointed to the Executive Council and given portfolio responsibilities supervising government departments. They were not \"Ministers\" in the modern sense, however, as they were still responsible only to the Governor and could not be dismissed by the Legislative Council. In 1967, however, a full ministerial system was adopted, with a Cabinet responsible to the Legislature. Ratu Kamisese Mara (who was subsequently knighted in 1969) was appointed as the first Chief Minister.\n\nWhen Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970, the Legislative Council was replaced by the Fijian Parliament. A grandfather clause in the Constitution provided for the old Legislative Council to remain in office, with its name changed to the \"House of Representatives\", pending the first post-independence elections of 1972.\n"}

The Mullins Center is the home of UMass Minutemen men's basketball, women's basketball, and men's ice hockey. In addition, the venue hosts numerous concerts, family shows, theater shows, and commencements annually. Located adjacent to the Mullins Center is the Mullins Community Ice Rink, which is open for public skating and racquetball, while also serving as the home rink for the UMass women's ice hockey team.\n\nIn 1985, William D. Mullins, a state representative from Ludlow, suggested that the university needed a multipurpose arena and convocation center to help expand the athletic program and assist in the university's growth. He died in 1986, but the state went ahead with the building of the complex, naming it for him. It replaced the Curry Hicks Cage, the 1930s-era basketball gymnasium, as home of the Minutemen basketball teams.

Colquitt\n\nAlfred Holt Colquitt (April 20, 1824March 26, 1894) was an American lawyer, preacher, soldier, and politician. Elected as the 49th Governor of Georgia (1877–1882), he was one of numerous Democrats elected to office as white conservatives took back power in the state at the end of the Reconstruction era. He was elected by the Georgia state legislature to two terms as U.S. Senator, serving from 1883–1894 and dying in office. He had served as a United States officer in the Mexican-American War and in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, reaching the rank of brigadier general.\n\nAlfred Colquitt was born in Monroe, Georgia. His father, Walter T. Colquitt, became a United States Representative and Senator from Georgia. The younger Colquitt graduated from Princeton College in 1844, studied law and passed his bar examination in 1846. He began practicing law in Monroe.\n\nDuring the Mexican–American War (1848-1849), Colquitt served as a paymaster in the United States Army at the rank of major. After the war, Colquitt was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives, serving one term from 1853 to 1855. He next was elected to and served in the Georgia state legislature. Colquitt was a delegate to \"The Georgia Secession Convention of 1861\": he voted in favor of secession and signed Georgia's Ordinance of Secession on January 19, 1861.\n\nAt the beginning of the civil war, Colquitt was appointed captain in the 6th Georgia Infantry. Eventually rising to colonel, he led his regiment in the Peninsula Campaign. At Seven Pines, he assumed brigade command after Brig. Gen Gabriel Rains was wounded, and led it through the Seven Days Battles. He led his brigade under Stonewall Jackson in the Battle of South Mountain, Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, and the Battle of Chancellorsville. Colquitt survived Antietam unscathed although nearly every other officer in the brigade was killed or wounded. After the battle, he was immediately promoted to brigadier general, to rank from September 1. \n\nAfter Chancellorsville, some questions arose about Colquitt's performance during that battle, and he was transferred to North Carolina in exchange for Brig. Gen Junius Daniel's brigade. His brigade was transferred again in the summer of 1863 to protect Charleston, South Carolina. In February 1864, Colquitt marched his brigade south to help defend against the Union invasion of Florida, and was victorious in the Battle of Olustee. After this battle, Colquitt's brigade rejoined Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Late in the war the brigade returned to defend North Carolina, where Colquitt surrendered in 1865.\n\nAfter returning to political life and near the end of the Reconstruction era, Colquitt defeated Republican candidate Jonathan Norcross for governor of Georgia in 1876. He was one of a number of Democrats elected to office as white conservatives regained power in the state, in part by an overt effort by paramilitary insurgents to disrupt and suppress Republican voting, especially by freedmen. Around that time, several thousand \"friends\" asked for about 30 open government patronage jobs. Those who did not get one of the jobs tried to turn voters against Colquitt. There were rumors that Colquitt was involved in illegal dealings with the Northeastern Railroad. A legislative committee found the governor innocent. During this time he was a part of the Bourbon Triumvirate.\n\nColquitt was reelected in 1880 to serve two years under the new state constitution, which reduced the term of governor from four years to two. Under his term, debt was reduced. \n\nIn 1883, Colquitt was elected by the state legislature as a Democrat to the US Senate from Georgia (this was the practice before an amendment for popular election of senators was ratified in the 20th century). He was re-elected to a second term in 1888. \n\nIn 1892, Colquitt suffered a stroke and became partially paralyzed. He recovered enough to resume his duties as a senator, but in March 1894, he suffered another stroke that left him mostly incapacitated. He died two weeks later. His body was returned to Georgia, where he was buried in Rose Hill cemetery in Macon.\n\nColquitt's brother, Col. Peyton H. Colquitt, was killed at age 31 at the Battle of Chickamauga. \n\nColquitt was married twice: first to the former Dorothy Elizabeth Tarver (1829-1855), and after her death to her brother's widow, the former Sarah Bunn Tarver (1832-1898). He was the father of three children with his first wife and seven children with his second wife.\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-13\n\n"}

The new cinema would have been in direct competition with their jointly owned cinemas in Dublin city centre, The Savoy, and The Screen. This resulted in a long-running legal struggle that led to a major case in Four Courts in which the Ward and Anderson families eventually agreed to split their cinema empire in January 2013.\nThe agreement to divide the assets allocated 23 cinemas to the Anderson family including the 13-screen Cork Omniplex and 22 other cinemas in their Omniplex Cinemas Group.

However, typical \"soft targets\" are civilian sites where unarmed people congregate in large numbers; examples include national monuments, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers, movie theaters, cafés and restaurants, places of worship, nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as railway stations, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives. Soft targets are contrasted with hard targets, which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected. Examples of hard targets include airports, government buildings, military installations, diplomatic missions, and power stations.\n\nTerrorist groups more often choose to strike soft targets. Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck soft targets and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets. The intent of attacks on soft targets is to instill fear as well as inflict casualties. Clark Kent Ervin notes that attacks on soft targets inflict psychological damage. In 2011, while preparations were being made for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the deputy commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.\n\nMilitary and paramilitary groups may adopt a strategy of attacking soft targets in order to avoid direct confrontation with a stronger opponent. For example, U.S. military general John Galvin noted in 1987 that Contra rebels switched to civilian targets rather than continuing the direct fighting against the Sandinista National Liberation Front.\n\n\n"}

For most of its history it was owned by the Eugene School District. Opened in 1938, the stadium was destroyed by fire in 2015 on June 29.\n\nCivic Stadium, located near East 20th Avenue and Willamette Street, adjacent to South Eugene High School, had a seating capacity of 6,800. Built in 1938 through a public-private partnership between the Eugene Area Chamber of Commerce, Eugene School District 4J, and the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA); the property had been owned by the school district from its construction until spring 2015. In October 2008, Civic Stadium was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOriginally built for high school football and baseball, in 1969 it became the home of the Eugene Emeralds minor league baseball team, which previously played at the privately owned Bethel Park (north of Roosevelt Boulevard (); its outfield is present-day Lark Park). The Emeralds moved up to the Pacific Coast League (AAA) in 1969 and needed a larger venue. After five seasons in the PCL, they returned to the Class A Northwest League in 1974 and played in the stadium through 2009. (High school football moved to the University of Oregon's Autzen Stadium in 1969, following the installation of artificial turf.) Before the departure of the Emeralds in 2009, Civic Stadium was one of the ten oldest active minor league baseball facilities in the United States.\n\nThe lighted playing field at Civic Stadium had an unorthodox alignment, oriented southeast (home plate to center field); the recommended alignment of a baseball diamond is east-northeast.\n\nIn August 2009, the Emeralds announced their relocation to the University of Oregon's PK Park for the 2010 season. The Emeralds cited Civic Stadium's need of substantial renovations, major problems with irrigation and electrical systems, as well as broken seats, and estimated that modernization could cost as much as $15 million.\n\nThe Emeralds played their last game at Civic Stadium on Thursday, September 4, 2009, a 5-3 loss to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. Following the game, fans collected pieces of the outfield turf as souvenirs.\n\nBy 2009, the school district designated the stadium a surplus property, although the district had not made a decision on whether to sell it. As recently as 2007, the school district examined options to redevelop all or part of the property, most likely as medium-density residential units. A local group, Friends of Civic Stadium, started a grassroots campaign in support of restoring the historic venue while also attempting to find alternative tenants.\n\nWith the future of the stadium in flux, it was one of ten entries on Restore Oregon's Most Endangered Places in Oregon 2011 list.\n\nIn April 2015, the Eugene Civic Alliance raised $4.1 million to buy the stadium and 10 acres of surrounding property from the school district. Eugene Civic Alliance is a non-profit made up of community leaders, including Lane United FC managing director Dave Galas, and the executive director of the Eugene youth sports organization Kidsports, former Ducks basketball player Bev Smith.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, Civic Stadium was destroyed by fire. Two days later, officials charged four pre-teen boys in connection with the fire, although the cause had not yet been determined conclusively. The stadium was delisted from the National Register of Historic Places on March 8, 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "1974619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974619", "title": "Szeto Wah", "text": "Szeto Wah\n\nSzeto Wah (; 28 February 1931 – 2 January 2011) was a prominent Hong Kong democracy activist and politician. He was the founding chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union and former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1985 to 1997 and from 1997 to 2004.\n\nBeing one of the two icons of the Hong Kong democracy movement alongside Martin Lee, Szeto played an instrumental role in the emergence of the pro-democracy camp. Entering the politics as a trade unionist for teachers, Szeto founded the influential Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union and was first elected to the colonial legislature through the newly created Teaching functional constituency in 1985. He and Martin Lee became the two pro-democrats appointed to the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee by the Beijing government in 1985 until the duo resigned in the wake of the Tiananmen protests of 1989 which were bloodily suppressed by Beijing.\n\nSzeto played a significant part in gathering popular support of the Hong Kong public in the Tiananmen democracy movement and subsequently the Operation Yellowbird rescuing the wanted democracy activists. He also founded the Hong Kong Alliance which has been responsible for the annual memorials for the protests. On the basis of the pro-democracy support he also co-founded the United Democrats of Hong Kong to contest in the first Legislative Council direct elections which later transformed into the Democratic Party.\n\nSzeto remained the unofficial party whip of the Democratic Party. He retired from the Legislative Council in 2004 and remained his influence in the pan-democracy camp. In 2010, he led the moderate faction of the camp to oppose the radical-led Five Constituencies Referendum movement and played a significant role in drawing the revised proposal of the electoral reform package in the Democrats' negotiation with the Beijing authorities over. He remained the chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance until he died in 2011 at the age of 79.\n\nSzeto Wah was born in Hong Kong on 28 February 1931 in Hong Kong with the family root in Chikan, Kaiping, Guangdong. His father, Szeto Ting, moved to Hong Kong for work during his young age. In 1941 during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, his family moved back to Kaiping. He recalled his patriotism grew during the war when he heard about the stories of the Chinese war heroes. His mother died at the age of 38 in 1942 and his father remarried afterwards. In 1945 when the war almost ended, his family moved back to Hong Kong. His father died of cancer at the Precious Blood Hospital in 1952 and was survived by his second wife and ten children.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Szeto Wah studied at the Yau Ma Tei Government School and then the Queen's College, and graduated from the Grantham College of Education. Under his brother Szeto Ming's influence, he and his siblings joined the YWCA which had a strong left-wing leaning at the time during his student life. He was contacted by the underground Communists and joined the Chinese New Democracy Youth League, the predecessor of the Communist Youth League of China, in September 1949. Under the instruction of the Communist Party of China, Szeto founded the Hok Yau Club in 1949. Without any official affiliation, Hok Yau Club was responsible for recruiting youths for the Communist cause. Among the recruits at the time was Mo Kwan-nin, who rose to the deputy director of the New China News Agency in 1980s. The club ceased to function between 1952 and 1953 after it was busted by the Hong Kong Police Special Branch. At the same time, he entered the teaching profession in 1952.\n\nAfter the club resumed activities in 1953, Szeto Wah was ousted in the leadership elections in 1957 and 1958 by the \"red faction\", the students who studied at the pro-Communist schools compared to the \"gray faction\" who studied at the English schools like Szeto himself. After his leadership was stripped, Szeto was frustrated with the power struggles and the distrust by the party leadership. Szeto was sent to become an editor at the left-leaning \"Children's Weekly\" in 1960. At the same time, he became headmaster of the GCEPSA Kwun Tong Primary School in 1961. After the journal was closed down in 1966, the party ceased to contact Szeto.\n\nIn 1971, the Hong Kong government suggested unpegging the salaries of the certificated masters to the nurses to cut their salaries by 15 per cent which sparked an uproar among the teachers. Szeto Wah was actively involved in the opposition campaign and the founding of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (HKPTU) in 1972 as the founding vice-chairman under Tsin Sai-nin. In April 1973, Szeto Wah took a leading role in two waves of labour strikes. After the strikes, the teachers negotiated with government representative Jack Cater with Bishop Francis Hsu as the meditator. As a result, the teachers cancelled the third labour strike and began the negotiation process with the government. The government eventually backed down on the plan, but installed a \"3-2-2\" standard which raised the salaries of the certificated masters after their salary points had reached the highest levels in three, two and two years.\n\nThe PTU was found in 1972 as an instrument for Tsin Sai-nin to gather teachers' votes in the 1973 Urban Council election, as Tsin was opposed by the Hong Kong Teachers' Association. After Tsin was elected, he quit the PTU preparatory committee and the chairmanship was succeeded by Szeto. Szeto became the first chairman elected in 1974 and assumed its position until 1990. He was seen by journalist Louise do Rosaio as \"a dictatorial leader...in most meetings he monopolises the talking, with detail of his plan, strategies well-sorted out before his colleagues start to comprehend the basic outline.\"\n\nIn 1977, the Precious Blood Golden Jubilee Secondary School was exposed with a corruption scandal. The teachers and students launched a strike for two days. In response to it, the Director of Education issued warning letters to the teachers. The PTU received complaints from the teachers and demanded the withdrawal of the warning letters. Afterwards, the school changed its leadership and issued new restrictions into teachers' contracts and issued warning letters to teachers regardless Szeto Wah's advice. In May 1977, the Education Department closed down the school with the approval of the Executive Council. The PTU organised assemblies and petitions to demand the reopening of the school and investigation of the event. As a result, Governor Murray MacLehose appointed a three-member committee into the event consisting of Rayson Huang, Lo King-man and Maisie Wong. The committee suggested the founding of the Ng Yuk Secondary School to receive the teachers and students, withdraw the warning letters and negate the actions of the school.\n\nThe PTU continued to grow into a significant labour union and pressure group in the territory. According to do Rosario, Szeto even became one of \"the most influential persons in Hongkong's political scene mid-70s\". Due to its scale and influence, the PTU was put under surveillance by the Standing Committee on Pressure Groups (SCOPG) of the Hong Kong government in 1979. In the report, the PTU was noted by its influence and organisation. Szeto was highlighted for his leadership and effectiveness in maintaining the PTU's independence against Communist infiltration.\n\nIn 1978, Szeto Wah was elected chairman of the joint committee of the Chinese Language Movement during the second wave of the movement for the equal status of the Chinese language to English. The joint committee laid out three goals: the full implementation of the Chinese language as the official language, teaching with Chinese in school, and improvement of the Chinese teaching along with English. The movement died down as the Sino-British negotiation over the Hong Kong sovereignty took the spotlight in the early 1980s.\n\nSzeto was also involved in the Defend Diaoyu Islands movement in 1982 sparked by the Japanese government's revision of the history textbooks. He organised the assembly on 18 September, the anniversary of the Mukden Incident, in Victoria Park which was well attended.\n\nIn the 1980s during the Sino-British negotiation over the Hong Kong sovereignty, Szeto Wah called for the Chinese resumption of the Hong Kong sovereignty and a democratic China and Hong Kong. In 1984 the Hong Kong government published the \"Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong\" to suggest the introduction of direct elections in Hong Kong. Initiated by the Szeto-led PTU, 89 organisations attended an assembly at the Ko Shan Theatre on 18 September 1984 in response to the Green Paper. In December 1984, Szeto was invited by the Beijing government to witness the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\n\nIn 1985, the Beijing government invited Szeto to sit on the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee to draft the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the mini-constitution of the Special Administrative Region after 1997. He met another like-minded barrister Martin Lee in the Drafting Committee with whom he began to push for further democratisation in the following years. In the first indirect elections to the Legislative Council, Szeto was elected through the Teaching functional constituency with Martin Lee who got elected through the Legal sector.\n\nSzeto Wah began actively pushing a faster pace of democratisation. On 27 October 1986, 91 organisations gathered to form the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government to push forward the proposal of the \"Group of 190\" which demanded half of the seats in the 1988 Legislative Council to be elected directly. The committee also sent a delegation including Szeto to Beijing to meet with deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Li Hou. However, despite the general support the committee received on the 1988 direct elections, the Hong Kong government's Survey Office concluded that 70 per cent of the people opposed it. The government's decision to introduce direct elections only in 1991 was protested by the pro-democrats who burnt a paper-made lame duck to mock the Hong Kong government's back down in front of Beijing's pressure.\n\nThe joint committee also demanded direct elections of the post-1997 Chief Executive and the Legislative Council to be included in the Basic Law. The Group of 190 proposal was countered by the highly conservative Cha proposal by Louis Cha and Cha Chi-ming backed by Beijing. The joint committee launched a series of campaign against the Cha proposal. As a result, Szeto Wah and Martin Lee became the only two drafters to vote against the proposal in the Drafting Committee.\n\nThe Tiananmen protests became the breaking point of the relationship of Szeto Wah and the Communist Party. The Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government was active in voicing support in the student protests in Beijing starting from May. On 20 May, it organised a rally against the government's martial law which attracted a large amount of turnout despite under the typhoon no. 8. On the next day, another million attended the rally marching from Chater Road in Central to Happy Valley Racecourse. The joint committee announced its reorganisation into the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. Szeto was elected chairman of the alliance, in which he assumed until his death in 2011.\n\nOn 27 May, the alliance helped organise the Concert For Democracy in China at the Happy Valley Racecourse. On the next day, the alliance organised another rally where a million people turned out. After the bloody crackdown on the protesters on 4 June, the alliance organised a rally condemning the Beijing authorities. On 5 June when Hong Kong activist Lee Cheuk-yan was arrested in Beijing, Szeto and Albert Ho met with Governor David Wilson at the Government House and insisted that they would not leave if the Governor did not call Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for help. After an hour of stalemate, Wilson sent a telegraph to London seeking for assistance.\n\nSzeto also planned a general strike on 7 June. However a minor riot in Mong Kok in the early morning of 7 June. He received a call from Lydia Dunn, the Senior Member of the Executive Council, saying that she received a report from the police that some men from Mainland were involved in the riot. He was suggested to cancel the planned rally in which he agreed.\n\nSzeto also resigned from his position in the Drafting Committee with Martin Lee after the crackdown. They were strongly criticised by the Beijing authorities, being called \"subversive\" and denied entry to the Mainland. He also refused to enter Mainland since. Under his chairmanship, the alliance laid out several goals, including the rehabilitation the 1989 pro-democracy movement. He had also been responsible for the annual Tiananmen memorials and the candlelight vigil at the Victoria Park since 1990. In 2009, it saw a resurgence of the attendees of the candlelight vigil. Governor David Wilson and Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had also asked Szeto for three times to disband the alliance but was refused by Szeto.\n\nThe alliance was also involved in the Operation Yellowbird, providing shelter for the escaped activists in Hong Kong, confirming the identity of the activists with the Hong Kong Police Special Branch, liaising with the foreign consuls for the refuge applications and so forth, which successfully smuggled three or four hundred people abroad including student leaders Chai Ling and Wu'erkaixi.\n\nOn 6 April 1990, Szeto Wah and other democracy activists formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong, the first pro-democracy political party in the wake of the Tiananmen democracy movement and the coming first direct election in 1991. Szeto Wah ran in Kowloon East, receiving more than 57,000 votes and elected with his ally Meeting Point's Li Wah-ming. The United Democrats emerged as the largest party in the legislature by winning 14 of the 18 directly elected seats.\n\nAfter the election, the British government replaced David Wilson with Chris Patten as the last Governor of Hong Kong. In his inaugural policy address, Patten proposed a bold electoral reform proposal which broadened the franchise of the nine newly created functional constituencies. Patten's proposal received strong opposition from the Beijing authorities. In response to the Beijing's strong stance, the United Democrats saw the need to unite with the moderate democrats, and therefore merged with the Meeting Point to form the Democratic Party in 1994. In the mutual understanding between Szeto Wah and Martin Lee, Lee was the chairman of the party while Szeto was in charge of the alliance. Nonetheless, Szeto was given as the unofficial position of \"party whip\" due to his seniority without much actual power.\n\nSzeto Wah ran in the 1995 Legislative Council election as implemented by the Patten's proposal. He defeated another veteran politician Elsie Tu in Kowloon Southeast, who he had defeated few months ago in the Urban Council election. The Democratic Party won 12 of the 20 directly elected seats. With other individuals, the pro-democrats won 31 of the 60 seats. In response to the Patten's proposal, Beijing decided to dismantle the promised \"through train\" which allowed the 1995 elected legislature to survive through 1997. The Democrats boycotted the Provisional Legislative Council as they deemed as extra-constitutional.\n\nSzeto Wah also launched a petition movement as the civil Chief Executive to mock the first Chief Executive election of 1996 by the Beijing-controlled 400-member Selection Committee. Szeto eventually accumulated more than 104,000 signatures with their ID numbers. The election was ultimately won by shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa who was hand-picked by Beijing.\n\nFor his staunch pro-democracy conviction, \"Time\" once described him as \"democracy's foot soldier\", and named him one of the 25 most influential people in Hong Kong. In 1997, he was awarded the Homo Homini Award for human rights activism by the Czech group People in Need.\n\nSzeto Wah and other Democrats ran in the first SAR Legislative Council election in May 1998 in which Szeto and Li Wah-ming won about 145,000 votes, taking two of the three seats in Kowloon East. Although the pro-democrats won 20 seats, their influence was balanced by the pro-Beijing members elected through the 10-seat Election Committee constituency. Szeto was re-elected in 2000 and decided to retire in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, the \"Real Brothers incident\" broke out in the Democratic Party as there were allegations of the reformist faction being infiltrated by Beijing. Szeto Wah became one of the five-member committee to investigate the incident. As a result, the accused reformist faction was defeated in the 2006 intra-party election.\n\nOn 25 May 2007 Szeto Wah was one of eight people arrested and charged with speaking at a radio show broadcast hosted by the unlicensed Citizen's Radio on the subject of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest. Critics have argued that the Hong Kong government has selectively persecuted Szeto for using unlicensed equipment when delivering the political message as other members have spoken on the radio and were not charged.\n\nIn December 2009, Szeto Wah was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He was told by pro-Beijing politician Cheng Kai-nam that the central government was concerned about his illness. Some mainland doctors were sent to see Szeto. Chief Executive Donald Tsang also visited Szeto and told him that he could arrange Szeto to be treated in Mainland. However, Szeto said that \"many people in China are being tortured and prosecuted, and if I go back it would be a privilege, a totally different treatment. I feel guilty and cannot accept the offer.\"\n\nIn 2009, the radical democratic League of Social Democrats (LSD) proposed the resignation of the pro-democracy legislator in each geographical constituency to trigger a territory-wide \"de facto\" referendum called the \"Five Constituencies Referendum\" over the 2012 constitutional reform package. Szeto initially said it was considerable and suggested the Democratic Party to actively respond to it. However, after a period of observation, Szeto believed the true intention of the LSD was to take over the leadership of the democracy movement as they had aggressively attacked other allies within the camp. Szeto then shifted his stance on the movement and actively opposed the proposed plan. In December 2009, the Democratic Party voted down the proposal to join the movement. As the pro-Beijing parties boycotted the by-elections, the turnout rate was only 17 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party leaders began to negotiate with the Beijing authorities and a revised proposal suggested by Szeto Wah was accepted by Beijing. Szeto Wah attended the party meeting after chemotherapy raised support of the revised proposal, stating that it was better to have the increase of five directly elected seats, five functional constituency seats but almost directly elected and the abolition of the appointed District Council seats than nothing.\n\nAfter the Democratic Party voted for the revised package, the Democratic Party and Szeto Wah received harsh criticisms from its former allies and supporters, condemning them for betraying democracy and the Hong Kong people. \"Longhair\" Leung Kwok-hung in a protest in front of the PTU headquarters said Szeto Wah had his cancer got into his brain. In the following July 1 march, Szeto on his wheelchair also received criticisms from his supporters, saying that the \"Democratic Party sold out Hong Kong people.\" In response, Szeto argued, \"Sold out? How much for selling out? ... Are you pig or dog? Can you be sold out?\"\n\nSzeto Wah died on 2 January 2011 at the age of 79 at the Prince of Wales Hospital. His last word was \"success doesn't need to involve me; however, when success comes I will be part of it.\" In a service at St Andrew's Church in Tsim Sha Tsui, bells tolled six long and four short times, representing the victims of the Tiananmen Square protests. In accordance with his wishes, Szeto's body was cremated; half the ashes to be scattered in HK waters, the other half scattered in a garden at Cape Collinson Crematorium. Chief Executive Donald Tsang described Szeto as \"passionate about China and Hong Kong, Mr Szeto Wah was devoted in promoting democracy. Upright, industrious and unwavering in the pursuit of his ideals, Mr Szeto earned great respect from across the community.\"\n\nExiled mainland dissidents Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi had expressed their strong desire to attend the funeral. Pan-democrats petitioned the Hong Kong government to allow them to enter Hong Kong to attend Szeto's funeral on compassionate grounds under the one country, two systems principle, although NPCSC delegate Rita Fan said the request represented a huge dilemma for the government as it would set a precedent. On 10 January, Wang Guangya, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, declared that decision on whether to allow dissidents to enter was in the hands of the Hong Kong government; he expressed confidence that they would \"handle it well\". On 26 January, the government announced that the application of Wang Dan to enter Hong Kong had been declined by after \"careful consideration\"; spokesman said the decision was made based on the potential \"consequences\" of allowing him in. The decision was denounced by Wang, Wu'er Kaixi, and pro-democrat legislator Lee Cheuk-yan, saying that the government had surrendered the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nSzeto Wah was never married in his life. He only had a romance publicly acknowledged with his fellow teacher Wong Siu-yung who died in the 1980s. Under Wong's influence, Szeto was baptized as Christian on 8 April 1985. He lived with his younger sister in Mong Kok. His brother, Szeto Keung, joined the state-owned New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch in the 1950s and remained working there.\n\nAside from his political career, Szeto was also well known for his Chinese calligraphy skills. He was also a keen swimmer.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was built in 1930 and holds 12,000 people. It was the home of the Chattanooga Lookouts until 1999 when they moved to their current stadium, AT&T Field. The former Tennessee Temple University held its home games at Engel after the Lookouts left. Engel Stadium was named for longtime President of the Chattanooga Lookouts, Joe Engel.\n\nThe ballpark is located at 1130 E. 3rd Street, at the corner of O'Neal Street, adjacent to the historic Fort Wood neighborhood, Norfolk Southern's DeButts Yard, and Erlanger Hospital. The park is bounded by East 3rd Street, O'Neal Street, East 5th Street, and railroad tracks.\n\nIn 1929, Clark Griffith, owner of the Washington Senators sent a young scout by the name of Joe Engel to the South to find a home for the club's first minor league affiliate. First, Engel went to Atlanta with cash in hand to buy the Atlanta Crackers, but for reasons unknown he backed out and came north to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Engel not only bought the Chattanooga Lookouts from Sammy Strang, but also replaced their ballpark, Andrews Field with a state-of-the-art stadium at a cost of $150,000.\n\nAndrews Field had been the team's home since 1911. (Their first two seasons, 1909 and 1910, they played their games at Chamberlain Field.) Andrews was on the same block as Engel Stadium, with home plate in the opposite corner. The rebuilding effort was sufficiently completed to allow the new facility to open for exhibition play on March 23, 1930. The regular season opener was April 15, 1930.\n\nEngel Stadium featured a spacious outfield, especially the corner to the left of straightaway center field, which was posted as 471 feet. The gradual rise of Third Street along the left field wall necessitated a \"terrace\" or hill to make up the difference in grade between the field and the street. The terrace contained the word \"LOOKOUTS\" in large letters. Harmon Killebrew is said to be the only man to hit a ball over the deepest part of the outfield.\n\nMany of Joe Engel's famous antics also took place at Engel Stadium, gaining him the nickname, \"The Barnum of Baseball.\" In 1931, the New York Yankees played an exhibition game at Engel Stadium against the Lookouts. During the game, a 17-year-old girl named Jackie Mitchell pitched for the Lookouts, striking out Major League greats Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. In 1936, a record crowd of 24,624 fans crammed into the park that only held 12,000 seats for the chance of winning a house in the middle of the Great Depression. The winning ticket was not at the game. On Opening Day in 1938, Joe Engel debuted his popular \"Wild Elephant Hunt\" prior to the game. It was such a success, he took it to ballparks throughout the South.\n\nMany notables have played on the field, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron, Satchel Paige, Willie Mays, Harmon Killebrew, Ferguson Jenkins, Kiki Cuyler, and Rogers Hornsby.\n\nWhen the Lookouts could not find an affiliate from 1966 to 1975, the Stadium began to deteriorate. Despite amateur games being played at Engel day and night all summer long, it was not being properly maintained. In 1972, Chattanooga News Free Press columnist Allan Morris wrote that \"paint is peeling off the walls, the floor is filthy, the roof is falling down, and it looks like a tornado hit the place.\" When Woody Reid bought the club in 1976 and gained a Major League affiliate in the Oakland Athletics, he hosted \"Sparkle Days\" at the stadium, where fans volunteered their time to fixing up Engel.\n\nIn the winter of 1988, Engel Stadium underwent its first major renovation. The $2 million project called for a new look to the exterior of the stadium, a two-story front office building built down the first base line, a new press box on top of the roof, a restaurant in the concourse with a view of the field, and a resurfaced field. \"We were trying to do things in a real haphazard way\", said Lookouts General Manager Bill Lee. The renovation resulted in a half-million dollar lawsuit by the Lookouts against the city and county for installing a field that did not drain properly.\n\nIn the winter of 1994, Frank Burke bought the Lookouts. Years later he would say, \"Finding Engel Stadium was a bit like falling in love: initially, you don't see some of the downsides.\" The downside was that Engel Stadium was becoming so costly to keep up that he could not turn a profit. By 1998, the situation got so severe that Burke agreed to fund a new ballpark on top of Hawk Hill, so long as he could sell 1,800 season tickets and 10 luxury boxes for his new park by February 4, 1999. Burke met his goal a week early and the Lookouts played their last game at Engel Stadium on September 10, 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Hamilton County and the city of Chattanooga assumed joint ownership of Engel Stadium. It was subsequently leased to Tennessee Temple University for use as their baseball team's home field. The field was modified, with a fence running across the left and center fields to reduce the dimensions of the playing field. The terrace still exists, beyond the inner fence, and covered with grass, the \"LOOKOUTS\" having been removed.\n\nIn 2008, UT Chattanooga acquired the property. The University will build a state-of-the-art track and field complex in the current parking lot and partner with the Engel Foundation in the restoration of the Stadium. On April 5, 2011 the City of Chattanooga passed an interim agreement allowing UTC to take control of the Stadium, pending final approval of the state government. Vice Chancellor Richard Brown announced plans to work with The Engel Foundation to restore the Stadium, which was damaged during a tornado in April 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Engel Stadium was used as the movie set for the motion picture \"42\", the life story of Jackie Robinson. Much of the entire film's baseball action was shot at Engel Stadium, which also doubled for Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field. On July 18, 2012 crews began demolition to restore the ballpark back to its historical accuracy after construction was done for the movie that altered the ballpark, including moving the location of the ball fields.\n\nIn April 2009, The Engel Foundation was formed to restore, preserve, promote, and revitalize Engel Stadium. \"It is just kind of sitting there\", said Foundation director Janna Jahn. \"It is not getting the maintenance it needs. It is not being promoted.\" In its short existence, the Foundation has hosted a Great Spaces Open House at the Stadium that was attended by over a hundred people, two Legends Baseball Camps led by former major leaguers Steve Trout, Rick Honeycutt, Willie Wilson, and Jay Johnstone, and on December 14, 2009, Engel Stadium was approved as a site on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Engel Foundation plans to raise $150,000 in needed repairs. Once that is accomplished, the Foundation wants to promote Engel as a destination for events from Little League Baseball, to middle/ high school baseball to adult league baseball. The venue could also serve as a museum to Chattanooga baseball, a site for concerts, and other community events.\n\nIn May 2013 the Foundation announced that the stadium would be renovated and ready to hold baseball games by the 2014 season. The foundation released a statement claiming that $200,000 will be necessary to complete the renovations.\n\n"}
{"id": "1974631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974631", "title": "Wade Stadium", "text": "Wade Stadium\n\nWade Stadium is a baseball park located near the intersection of Grand Avenue and 34th Avenue West in the West Duluth neighborhood of Duluth, Minnesota. The stadium was built in 1941 and holds 4,200 people. It is the home of the Duluth Huskies of the Northwoods League and The College of St. Scholastica baseball team who have won 19 straight Upper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC) regular season and 18 straight post-season titles. \"The Wade\", as it is sometimes called by fans, was also the home of the Duluth–Superior Dukes of the reincarnated Northern League from 1993 until 2002, and the home of Dukes of the original Northern League from 1941 until 1970. One of a dying breed of Works Progress Administration (WPA) constructed stadiums, \"The Wade\" is noted for its short distances (especially from home plate to center field), its high fences, and the cool, damp weather generated by nearby Lake Superior.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the U.S. federal government used the WPA to fund projects to boost employment. One of these projects was the removal of the brick roadbed from Grand Avenue, which was then paved with asphalt. During the fall of 1940, road crews removed 381,000 bricks from the surface of Grand Avenue. Another WPA crew used these bricks to build Wade Stadium.\n\nThe decision to build Wade Stadium originated with a 1938 study commissioned by Walter Chantigney, chairman of Duluth's Citywide All-Sports committee. The study found that the Duluth Duke's existing stadium, Athletic Park, was obsolete. According to the study:\n\nChantigney gathered more than 7,500 signatures to place a construction bond measure on the November, 1938, ballot. After voters approved the bond measure, money was gathered over the next two years from bond sales, the state of Minnesota, and the WPA. The site selected for the new stadium was located directly across Grand Avenue from Athletic Park.\n\nA construction budget totaling $163,232 was set. But, due to cost overruns, the final cost of the stadium was $230,880. During construction, the project received several bailouts. One bailout came from Duluth's newly elected mayor, Edward H. Hatch, who purchased the materials needed to finish construction.\n\nThe stadium's original name was Duluth All-Sports Municipal Stadium. It was renamed Wade Municipal Stadium in 1954 in honor of former Duluth Dukes owner Frank Wade, who died in 1953.\n\nThe Duluth Dukes played their first game in the new stadium on July 16, 1941. Their first opponent was their local rival, the Superior Blues. When the Blues folded in 1955, the Dukes (known as the White Sox during the 1956–59 seasons) became the Duluth–Superior Dukes. The original Dukes played in Wade Stadium from 1941 through the 1970 season. The only break came during the 1943–45 seasons when the Northern League suspended play due to World War II. The stadium was the home of three teams in the Twin Ports League, the only Class E league in the history of baseball, in 1943.\n\nWhen television began carrying Major League Baseball games in the 1950s, minor league baseball suffered from a drop in advertising revenue. Many of the smaller minor leagues around the country folded. The Northern League became one of these casualties when it was announced prior to the 1971 season that it was ceasing operations. After the original Northern League disbanded, the stadium was rarely used over the next twelve years. It was being threatened with demolition when the newly created Northern League awarded Duluth a franchise in 1993. The Stadium has had a tenant every year since. When the Dukes moved out of the Stadium in 2002, the void was filled almost immediately by the Huskies.\n\n"}

It has a population of 3 081 inhabitants and a total area of 4.34 km.\n\nDume enjoyed in earlier times a relief situation especially in the sixth century during the reign of Theodemar king of the Suebi. His father, Chararic, invoked Saint Martin of Tours, when Theodemar was affected by a disease in childhood.\n\nAfter obtaining the cure in 550, he founded a church in Dume and sent emissaries to Gaul in search of relics of the saint. By providential provision, the emissaries of the king met with Martin of Pannonia (later to be canonized and known as Martin of Dume), who was heading from Jerusalem to Gaul, to the tomb of his namesake and compatriot. That meeting showed him the place where it should go to exercise his apostolate, because until then the Suebi had professed Arianism. He landed possibly in Portus Cale, where he went to Braga, to the court of Theodemar, completing the king's conversion, with the help of the bishop Eleutério and the bishop of Coimbra, Lucêncio. From Theodemar he obtained the newly founded Church of Dume, next to whom he built the Monastery of Dumio.\n\nSo remarkable became his action that in 558 it was elevated to the episcopal dignity, turning the church into a cathedral, the area of the monastery becoming the Bishopric of Dume.\nWith the Christian reconquest, after the Muslim invasion, the small diocese of Dume became embedded in Braga. The ancient parish of São Martinho de Dume was one resignation from the patronage of the presentation of the prelate of Braga.\nIn the parish there are several chapels, including one in the Romanesque style, in place of the Order, headed by S.

Downtown Winston-Salem is to the south. Germanton was the county seat of Stokes County prior to Forsyth County being created from southern Stokes. Before the creation of Forsyth County, Germanton was centrally located within the Stokes County limits.\n\nGermanton was established in 1790 and is the oldest community in Stokes County. The town's original were part of a tract that was granted to Jacob Lash by the Earl of Granville in 1762. The 23 acres were deeded from brothers Michael and Henry Frey. The town was named after an influx of Germanic immigrants, who had served as veterans of the American Revolution, were given incentives to settle the area. These settlers included both Germans who fought against the crown, and Hessians who had been loyal to the crown. American Revolutionary War Major Joseph Winston, later a U.S. congressman, was a famous Germanton resident with a plantation nearby.\n\nGermanton is located near the older Moravian settlements of Bethabara and Bethania, which were part of the Wachovia Tract settlement. The etymology of the \"Germanton\" name is often mistakenly attributed to this proximity. While Wachovia was settled for religious reasons by people originally from what is today the Czech Republic, the settlers of the Germanton area were primarily Lutheran, originally from areas in what is today Germany, and settled the area for non-religious purposes.

A \"forma\" is a specific taxonomic ranking below subspecies and usually designates the smallest degree in taxonomical nomenclature recording the slightest difference between taxa, typically based on one chief character.\nIt chief character that distinguishes \"Pachypodium bicolor\" from other species with yellow corolla is the presence of a white corolla tube or throat to the flower. \"Pachypodium bicolor\" is part of the \"Pachypodium rosulatum\" complex, where discussion centers on rather one is dealing with one species with many varieties, as Gordon Rowley argues, or many separate distinct species. The corolla, the collective term for the petals of a flower or the inner whorl of the perianth, in the nexus for taxonomical confusion of the taxon.\n\n\"Pachypodium bicolor\" is endemic to Madagascar in the low, open, deciduous, western forest growing on porous sandstone. The geological preference of \"Pachypodium bicolor\" is limited to one substrate. This makes it prefer a more specialized geological environment. Cultivation should stimulate this substrate.\n\nIt does not have a common name in the native tongue to Malagasy—\"from Madagascar.\"\n\n\"Pachypodium bicolor\" is a succulent plant, as are all \"Pachypodium.\" It grows normally in height with a densely branched crown that is up to approximately broad in diameter. Each branch is cylindrical and measures in diameter at the base. The branch comes from low down on the base of the plant. The branches are covered with leaf scars and the remains of spines. Beyond their base, the branches measure in diameter. Pale-grey in color, the bark is smooth. Branchlets from long and in diameter. They are covered with paired straight grey-brown spines long and in diameter at the base. The basal part, located at or near the base of a plant stem, is part of the spine and conical at 0.6 to 0.75 times the spine length. The young spines and the base of young leaves are densely white-lanate, having or consisting of woolly hairs.\n\nThe leaves of \"Pachypodium bicolor\" are subsessile, very much stalkless and attached directly at the base of the leaf, and confined to the apices of the branchlets. The leaves can be petiole, having a stalk by which a leaf is attached to a stem, at 0 mm to 2 mm (up to 0.08 in) long; meaning they have a very short stalk to the leave, if at all. Pubescent—hairy—the leaf blade is medium green with a pale green midrib above and a pale green below along with reticulate venation beneath when fresh. When the leaves are dried they are papery. Geometrically they take the shape of being ovate, shaped like an egg, to elliptic or narrowly elliptic at 3 to 5 times as long as wide. That measures at long by wide. At the apex, the blade is obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip; to rounded; and cuneate, wedge-shaped or triangular; at the base; glabrous, smooth; and with impressed venation above; ciliolate—\"having minute hairs along the margin or edge of a structure\". Beneath the blade is pubescent beneath, with 14 to 40 pairs of rather straight secondary veins forming an angle of 45–90° with the costa, with tertiary—\"third level of \"—venation reticulate, composing or a pattern of a netting.\n\nThe inflorescence is of \"Pachypodium bicolor\" is pedunculate, having the stalk of an inflorescence. It is congested at by with 5 to 8 flowers. The peduncle, the stalk, is terete, cylindrical but usually slightly tapering at both ends, circular in cross-section, and smooth-surfaced. It measures . The pedicels, small stalk or stalk-like parts bearing a single flower in an inflorescence, are pale reddish-green at long. They are slightly elongated in fruit at . The bracts are pale green, persistent—\"lasting until the maturity of the flower\"—and narrowly oblong, having a somewhat elongated spherical form with approximately parallel sides. They measure by and pubescent, hairy outside and sparsely pubescent inside.\n\nCollectively forming the outer floral envelope or layer of the perianth enclosing and supporting the developing bud, which is usually green; the sepals, are pale green, narrowly ovate—\"oval or egg-shaped\"—and 2 to 3 times as long as they are wide, measuring at . They are pubescent, hairy outside and glabrous, smooth without hairs inside. The sepals are acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point at the tips of certain leaves or petals or sepals, at their apex.\n\nThe corolla, a collective term for all the petals of a flower, is limb and medium yellow outside and bright yellow inside for \"Pachypodium bicolor\". The corolla is pale green at the base, medium yellow outside with 5 very pale green lines to just below the lobes. The distinguishing character of \"Pachypodium bicolor\" is that its throat or the inside of the corolla tube is white for about 3.5 cm long in the mature bud. It forms a broadly ovoid head 0.3 of the bud length in comparison, measuring at . Obtuse at the apex, it is pubescent, hairy outside and glabrous, smooth on the part of the lobes covered in bud. The pubescent belt inside is wide just below the insertion of the stamens. The corolla tube is infundibuliform, or more simply funnel-shaped, at 5 to 10 times as long as the calyx—\"the outer most layer of leaves in a flower, which are often green.\" The calyx is 1 to 1.46 times as long as the lobes at long. The basal part of the tube is almost cylindrical at 0.18–0.22 of the length of the entire tube, or long by wide. Towards the slightly widened apex, the upper part of the tube is obconical, inversely conical, at base and almost cylindrical above measuring at long to wide at the mouth. The lobe at the apex of the corolla tube are obliquely obovate at 0.6 to 0.8 times as long as the tube. That measures at 1.2 to 1.5 times as long as wide, or . The lobes are rounded at their individual apex.\n\nThe stamens, the male reproductive organ in a flower, have an apex below the opening, or mouth, of the corolla tube. They are, therefore, inserted at 0.16 to 0.2 of the length of the corolla tube. That measures at from the base. The anthers are by . The anthers have stiff hairs at the base of the connective, the sterile part between just below where they occur with the pistil head.\n\nThe pistil, the female reproductive part of a flower, is long. The ovary 2 mm long by 2 mm wide by 1.5 mm high (0.08 mm by 0.08 mm by 0.06 mm). They are pubescent or sparsely so with short, straight hairs. The disk of 5 unequal glands has 2 glands or 2 pairs of glands that are partly or entirely fused. These glands are broadly ovate, oval or egg-shaped, at high, rounded, emarginate or obtuse with an irregularly toothed apex that is less than half as long as the ovary. The style is filiform, having the form of or resembling a thread or filament, where it gradually thickens into a cylindrical-head. Composed of an obconical—\"inversely conical—\"basal part , the pistil head is high. It has a ring-shaped central part with a stigmoid apex measuring . The ovules are approximately 50 in each carpel, one of the structural units of a pistil, representing a modified, ovule-bearing leaf.\n\nThe fruit of \"Pachypodium bicolor\" is composed of 2 separate mericarps, sometimes only developing one. Mericaps are a carpel with one seed or one of a pair split apart at maturity. They form an angle from 10–60° at the base. Worth mentioning, there are occasion when the flowers and fruit in the same inflorescence. The mericarps are pale brown with longitudinal lines outside. Inside it is whitish inside and fusiform, tapering at each end; spindle-shaped, at . The mericarps are acute, having a sharp point or tip, at the apex and are pubescent with short hairs. The fruit wall is approximately thick.\n\nThe seeds are pale to medium brown, ovate, oval, elliptic, elliptical at 5 mm wide by 2 mm (0.2 by 0.08 in). The margin is revolute towards the hilar side. In other words, the edge of the seed is rolled backward from the margins to the undersurface on the scarred side of the seed from a stalk connecting an ovule or a seed with the placenta. The testa, the often thick or hard outer coat of a seed, is rough. The embryo is long. The cotyledons, the leaves of the embryo of a seed plant, are ovate, oval, egg-shaped, at 1.22 to 1.83 times as long as wide, measuring, 2.2 mm by 1.2 mm to 1.8 mm (0.09 in by 0.05 to 0.07 in). They are rounded at the apex and subcordate, somewhat like a heart in shape, at the base. The rootlet that forms is 1.04 times as long as the cotyledons at 2.3 mm long by 1 mm by 1.5 mm (0.09 by 0.04 by 0.06 in).\n\nDistribution to Madagascar. East of Belo sur Tsiribihina.\n\nPartly pendulant, \"Pachypodium bicolor\" forms a low shrub with a thickened trunk and a densely branched crown, the upper part of a tree or shrub, which includes the branches and leaves.\n\n\"Pachypodium bicolor\" is positioned on porous sandstone where it grows only in full sunlight. With an emphasis on openness, it is found in low open deciduous western forest. It grows at an altitude of approximately . The limitation to one substrate, a low altitude in the landscape, suggests that \"Pachypodium bicolor\" has developed a specialized landscape-environmental condition that should affect its horticulture. Other plants that can be found around it, species indicators, are \"Euphorbia\" aff. \"pedilanthoides\", \"E. viguieri\" (Euphorbiaceae), \"Uncarina leandrii\" var. \"rechbergeri\" (Pedaliaceae), \"Aloe\" sp., (Asphodelaceae) (Orchidaceae) (0.09 by 0.04 inch) \"Orchids\" sp. (0.09 by 0.04 inch) and \"Kalanchoe\" spp. (Crassulaceae).\n\nThe substrate should be loose peat with quartz sand at a pH level of 4.5. Temperatures from spring to autumn: night to day . Wintertime and dormancy: night and day . It flowers in the spring, presumably after dormancy, so it needs very dry conditions during its dormancy with only occasionally a little water.\n\nBy seeds or cuttings.\n\nAgain, in 1997, \"Pachypodium bicolor\" was given a full species level by the botanists J.J. Lavranos and S.H.J.V. Rapanarivo in the \"Cactus and Succulent Journal\" 69: 29-32 (1997).\n\nIts species type is: Madagascar, Toliara, along the Tsiribihina River, Bekinankina, West of Berevo, \"W. Röösli and R. Hoffman\" 33/96 (holotype P; isotype MO, TAN, WAG, ZSS). Fig 2, p. 15; Map 2, p. 12; Plates 5-7, opposite p. 17.\"\n\nG.D. Rowley apparently disagrees with this species definition and maintains another taxonomical ranking altogether in two of his works covering this issue of the taxon, visible in: \"Homotypic synonym\" \"Pachypodium rosulatum\" variety \"rosulatum\" forma \"bicolor\" (Lavranos & Rapanarivo) G.D. Rowley in Bradleya 16: 107 (1998) and Pachypodium & Adenium, The Cactus Files Handbook 5: 57 (1999), syn. nov\n\nSo what the reader can make of this taxonomical situation is that there is still considerable debate by very skilled botanists.\n\nThis article maintains the species rank of \"Pachypodium bicolor\" because of the presence of a white throat, or the corolla tube, is consistent with the authors of the most recent book to undertake a widespread examination of \"Pachypodium\" \"in situ\", or in the landscape, of continental southern Africa and Madagascar. Furthermore, the taxonomical definition of the taxa as a species has been accepted with the public use of the taxonomical rank, \"Pachypodium bicolor\" apparently.\n\n"}

This ecosystem is found in the Intermountain West in the United States.\n\nThe most common sagebrush species in the sagebrush steppe in most areas is big sagebrush (\"Artemisia tridentata\"). Others include three-tip sagebrush (\"Artemisia tripartita\") and low sagebrush (\"Artemisia arbuscula\"). Sagebrush is found alongside many species of grasses.\n\nSagebrush steppe is a diverse habitat, with more than 350 recorded vertebrate species. It is also open rangeland for livestock, a recreation area, and a source of water in otherwise arid regions. It is key habitat for declining flora and fauna species, such as greater sage-grouse (\"Centrocercus urophasianus\") and pygmy rabbit (\"Brachylagus idahoensis\").\n\nSagebrush steppe is a threatened ecosystem in many regions. It was once very widespread in the regions that form the Intermountain West, such as the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau. It has become fragmented and degraded by a number of forces. Steppe has been overgrown with introduced species and has changed to an ecosystem resembling pine and juniper woodland. This has changed the fire regime of the landscape, increasing fuel loads and increasing the chance of unnaturally severe wildfires. Cheatgrass (\"Bromus tectorum\") is also an important introduced plant species that increases fire risk in this ecosystem. Other forces leading to these habitat changes include fire suppression and overgrazing of livestock. Besides severe fire, consequences of the breakdown of sagebrush steppe include increased erosion of the land and sedimentation in local waterways, decreased water quality, decreased quality of forage available for livestock, and degradation of habitat for wildlife and game crabs.\n"}

Moved by profound political and moral beliefs, antifascist, he joined the Italian Resistance under the name of \"Benigno\" and became President of the Committee for National Liberation of Reggio Emilia, even if he always refused to use weapons.\n\nWhen fascist dictatorship in Italy ended, he became professor of Ecclesiastic law at University of Modena.\n\nHis political career was very fast. In 1945 he became vice-secretary of Democrazia Cristiana and on 2 June 1946 was elected to become part of the \"Costituente\" (the political body in charge of drafting the new Italian republican constitution), of which he became one of the most active members. Exactly he took part of the first Subcommission in charge of the \"rights and duties of the citizens\". In 1946, with Amintore Fanfani, Giorgio La Pira and Giuseppe Lazzati (described, not without a bit of deprecation, as \"little professors\") he founded the association \"Civitas Humana\".\n\nDossetti was anyway an atypical politician. He decided to not rerun for the 1948 elections and changed idea only to obey to Monsignor Montini (Pope Paolo VI). His evangelist positions were more or less opposed to the Alcide De Gasperi's more pragmatic ones. He was against NATO accession of Italy, which he considered dangerous, and in favour of social reforms aimed at helping the poorer parts of the population. Dossetti was presented to the Congress with over one third consensus. The contraposition with De Gasperi was very clear. He accepted the challenge and returned as deputy secretary of the party. During the following years he was actively involved in working at many reforms, including the Cassa del Mezzogiorno.\n\nHe left politics in 1951 and he returned for a while in 1956 just to run for mayor in Bologna, in which City Council he will stay for the following two years.\n\nIn the meantime, on 6 January 1956, he took religious vows after that, some months before, the Church authorities approved the monastic community of the \"Piccola famiglia dell'Annunziata\", founded by him and based on \"\"silence, prayer, work and poverty\"\". After three years he was ordained a priest.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he contributed as a collaborator of Cardinal Lercaro but since his presence was not welcome by some sectors of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, he chose to retire in silence. According to Cardinal Giacomo Biffi, Dossetti's personal role during the Second Vatican Council was of great importance, because he contributed to making the Council less conservative and traditional than what was originally planned.\n\nDuring the following years, his community expanded: from the first section near Bologna, in Terrasanta, to Giordania in Casaglia di Montesole.\n\nHe reappeared in public in 1994, when he expressed publicly his worries for the proposed modifications of the Italian constitution.\n\nDossetti died two years later, on 15 December 1996.\n\n\n\"Credo in un solo Dio padre onnipotente.

In 2009, Sentai Filmworks re-released the OVA on DVD.\n\nPolice Officers Maki, Reimi and Yuka are stuck on traffic patrol when they would prefer to be involved in more \"exciting\" police duties. All that changes when they join in a police chase after a kidnapped girl. As a result, they become involved in the case of a white slave organization run by the politically connected businessman Samuel McCoy.\n\nWhile going to the aid of another girl, Yuka is then kidnapped by McCoy’s men. Frustrated at the inaction by the Police Department to prosecute McCoy and rescue Yuka, Maki and Reimi take what they need from the police armory, including police assault carrier, and go to her rescue creating mayhem in their wake.\n\nThere are three series that are sequels to Burn Up. Two of the series, \"Burn Up W\" (an OVA in 4 parts) and \"Burn Up Excess\" (13 parts) form a mostly united story arc. Many of the characters in Burn Up also appear in Excess, but have different names. The third series, \"Burn Up Scramble!\", is unrelated to the other 2 series, except that it is a complete re-envisioning of the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaki is sitting in a park next to her motorcycle, in her racing suit. As she sits there, feeding pigeons, we cut away to a frantic highway chase with a young girl screaming in the backseat of the getaway car. Police dispatches a signal to all possible backup units, including two Junior SWAT team officers: Yuka and Remi. Preempting the speeding ticket they were about to issue, they join the pursuit and radio Maki for assistance. She suits up and enters the fray on her motorcycle, taking shortcuts over guardrails and weaving through police roadblocks. When the perpetrators open fire on her, cracking her racing helmet, she promptly becomes angered and draws a shotgun, kills one of the kidnappers, shoots the getaway car's engine, and the chase grinds to a halt.\n\nAt a police debriefing, which Kenji and his partner Banba are attending, it is revealed that the kidnappers could have connections to Samuel McCoy. Amidst rumors that his profitable chain of nightclubs and restaurants is a front for a lucrative prostitution and sex slave ring, it has been impossible until now to find any hard evidence. Kenji and Banba are ordered to interrogate the prisoner and get \"something that'll stick on McCoy's Teflon ass\".\n\nDuring a brief stop into the office where Maki is filing her incident report, Kenji sets up a date with Maki, and informing them of the pending case against McCoy. The news on McCoy, naturally, disgusts the three girls, but is quickly forgotten amidst Kenji and Maki's flirting, drawing up envy among the girls.\n\nThis date, however, is later interrupted by Banba bringing late news about the case. Despite Maki and Kenji's chagrin upon being interrupted at a very awkward moment (Maki wrapped in a towel after a shower and Kenji was in his briefs), they listen as he tells them they have had many sightings of missing women at one of McCoy's clubs, the Sartrait 7. Kenji declares it too dangerous, and outright forbids Maki to investigate. Date terminally interrupted, Maki brings Kenji back to the station to question the prisoner.\n\nHowever, when Kenji goes to interrogate the captured kidnapper, as ordered, he is shocked to find the man dead in his cell, poison needles peppering his body. This prompts the team to, reluctantly, investigate their only remaining lead, the Sartrait 7.\n\nWhile mingling with the crowd, Yuka stumbles upon a lonely, sad-looking girl in a frilly yellow dress, and goes to befriend her. The girl sobbingly confides that she was expecting her boyfriend, but has been stood up. Yuka offers to keep her company, keeping her safe and attempting to pick up her spirits by buying her a soft drink. However, at the vending machine, she is attacked from behind and subdued by a muscular thug, with the frilly yellow-dressed girl suspiciously acquiescent.\n\nThe thug is followed by Remi and Maki, who draw weapons and hold up the kidnappers. All goes well, until a muscular figure sweeps out of the shadows, with dark, almost slate-gray skin and long red hair. with shocking agility for a man his size, he leaps away from their every attack, throwing a hail of poison needles -the same as that which killed their prisoner- at them, knocking the girls unconscious.\n\nAt the hospital, the poison is neutralized and their wounds treated, and Kenji comes to tell them that they can't officially investigate the kidnapping of Yuka at McCoy's club, due to the lack of evidence. Even the presence of the red-haired killer -identified as Gonnack, McCoy's bodyguard and suspected assassin- isn't enough to issue a warrant on McCoy.\n\nMaki decides she's going to take matters into her own hands, using her Junior SWAT clearance to take what she needs from the armory, behind the chief's back. Remi reluctantly assists, and rigs an alarm to distract the security in the police garage. They steal a police assault carrier and make for McCoy's mansion.\n\nMeanwhile, Yuka is imprisoned in McCoy's basement, awakening in a cell with three other young women. Here, they sobbingly confirm that they are being groomed to be sex slaves to be sold off to the wealthy, with compliance or suicide the only possible escape.\n\nEventually, Maki and Remi learn the girls' location, and break Yuka and her cellmates out. Ordering the unarmed Yuka to lead the girls to safety, Maki and Remi press on to arrest McCoy. The women are waylaid, however, by an apparently panicked Sayaka, who runs into them in the hallway as she and McCoy try to escape the besieged compound. While she has them off guard, McCoy and Ryuji draw weapons and fire, wounding the two officers.\n\nMeanwhile, the SWAT reinforcements arrive, and Kenji himself appears in a helicopter, tracking the girls' location. He and Banba sneak in behind McCoy through a skylight, killing Ryuji and surrounding and arresting McCoy. He rescues Maki and Remi and, as she says herself upon fade out, \"that's that.\"\n\nLater, after the credits roll, Yuka visits Remi and Maki in the hospital and inquires as to when they would like to return to Sartrait 7. Both officers nearly fall out of their beds from the shock, leading Yuka to claim she was only joking.\n\n"}

After the June 4th massacre, the organisation main goals are the rehabilitation of the democracy movement and the accountability for the massacre. The main activities the organisation holds is the annual memorials and commemorations, of which the candlelight vigil are the most attended, reported and discussed event each year.\n\nThe Alliance has five operational goals:\n\n\nIn 1989, the sudden death of the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Hu Yaobang, widely considered a liberal figure within the party leadership, sparked a series of protests at the Tiananmen Square. The Hong Kong Federation of Students (FHKS) visited the in Beijing student protesters and mobilised for the support of the Hong Kong society after they returned to Hong Kong. On 20 May 1989 after Premier Li Peng imposed the martial law, the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government (JCPDG), an umbrella organisation of the local pro-democracy activists decided to hold a demonstration at the Victoria Park and marched to the headquarters of New China News Agency (NCNA). On 21 May during the No. 8 typhoon signal, more than a million people marched in the street in support of the Tiananmen protests. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China was founded during the march.\n\nOn 4 June 1989, the Beijing government bloodily suppressed the peaceful protest. After the massacre, delegates from more than 200 civil groups elected a 20-member Standing Committee headed by Szeto Wah and Martin Lee to hold the subsequent commemorations and actions. The Alliance helped the \"Operation Yellowbird\", providing shelters and financial assistance in helping smuggling leaders of the democracy movement out of China. The Alliance also set up a database of the democracy movement and published works related to the movement. It also maintain close relationship with the Tiananmen Mothers initiated by Ding Zilin, a group of family members of the ones who were killed in the massacre and vocally supported the democracy movements in China. Beijing's mouthpiece \"People's Daily\" accused the Alliance of having intention to overthrow the Chinese government. Szeto and Lee, who were members of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee were unseated by Beijing after the duo resigned from the committee after the massacre.\n\nThe annual candlelight vigil at the Victoria Park among other activities has been the most iconic event organised by the Alliance, as it is the most attended consecutive commemoration of the 1989 protests. Tensions were high in 1996, which marked the seventh anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre. Residents were not sure whether or not the annual demonstration would continue after the upcoming 1997 sovereignty handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. The eighth anniversary, in 1997, was just before the handover. People in the demonstration speculated that it might turn out to be the last vigil. In 1997, then Chief Executive-elect Tung Chee-hwa attempted to pressurise Szeto into not organising the vigil, and Szeto refused to speak to Tung ever again after three such attempts.\n\nAs the protests were largely censored in the Mainland China, the Alliance was one of the main sources of both the mainland and the local people to learn about the event. On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Alliance recorded a large increase in number of the attendees of the vigil, as many young generation attended the vigil. A year before the Alliance also organised events and protests in support of the Charter 08 movement launched by the mainland democracy activists such as Liu Xiaobo. After Szeto Wah, the Alliance's founding chairman died in 2011, the chairmanship was occupied by Lee Cheuk-yan. In 2014, the Alliance opened the June 4th Museum, the world's first memorial museum for the Tiananmen protests. In 2014, Albert Ho took over Lee as the Alliance chairman.\n\nThe number of attendees kept in a high level until in recent years the emergence of the localist movement challenged the meaning of commemorating the Tiananmen protests, as some young localists perceived themselves as non-Chinese and disagreed with one of the goals of the Alliance, \"build a democratic China\". Such view was held by localist scholar Chin Wan, who believed that the Chinese nationalistic sentiment and patriotism the Alliance projected was an obstacle for Hong Kong people to construct a distinct identity. Some other criticisms included the overlapping membership of the Alliance and the Democratic Party, the ritualization of the vigil and the ineffectiveness of the Alliance of achieving any of its operation goals. Since 2013 as the Hong Kong–Mainland China conflict intensified, the number of the attendees to the vigil gradually dropped. From 2015 to 16, the number the Alliance recorded dropped from 180,000 to 135,000.\n\n\n\n"}

The screenplay by Tom Rowe and Gary Goddard is loosely based on the 1912 novel \"Tarzan of the Apes\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but from the point of view of Jane Parker. It is the third filmed version of the story released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nThe original music score is composed by Perry Botkin Jr. Former Tarzan actor Jock Mahoney, billed as \"Jack O'Mahoney\", was the film's stunt coordinator. The film is marketed with the tagline \"Unlike any other \"Tarzan\" you've ever seen!\" The original actor cast in the Tarzan role was fired (or quit) early in production, resulting in the sudden casting of his stunt double, Miles O'Keeffe, in the title role. This film received extremely negative reviews, and in some circles has been considered to be one of the worst films ever made, even though it was a box-office success.\n\nJames Parker is a hunter in Africa, searching for a mythical \"white ape\". He is joined by his estranged daughter, Jane, after her mother's death. They discover the \"white ape\" is actually Tarzan, an uncivilized white man raised by apes living in the jungle. James continues to pursue Tarzan with the purpose of capturing him, dead or alive, and bringing him back to England.\n\nRealizing that James is on his trail, Tarzan kidnaps Jane. Jane and Tarzan become fascinated by each other. Jane is then kidnapped by natives who intend to make her a wife of the tribe leader, forcing Tarzan into action. James is killed by the Ivory King, and the natives remove Jane's clothes. Tarzan comes to the rescue and escapes from the natives. Tarzan and Jane fall in love.\n\n\nBo Derek was extremely popular at the time due to her appearance in \"10\". After making \"A Change of Seasons\", she was meant to appear in \"High Road to China\" but pulled out of the film saying she wanted to be directed only by her husband John.\n\nIn February 1980, MGM announced the studio was making a Tarzan film with the Dereks. Warner Bros. complained, as that studio was also developing a Tarzan film with Robert Towne called \"Greystoke\" and they had the rights to the character from the Burroughs estate. MGM argued the Derek film would be the second remake of their 1932 film \"Tarzan the Ape Man\" which they had the right to do, having released the first remake in 1959. The Burroughs estate sued MGM.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with the film history magazine \"Filmfax\", co-writer Gary Goddard revealed that he had originally been commissioned to write a screenplay for Bo Derek based upon the Marvel Comics superheroine, Dazzler; a 30-page treatment was completed before the project was cancelled and work instead proceeded on \"Tarzan, The Ape Man\" which initially carried the working title \"Me, Jane\" reflecting its focus on Jane Porter as a showcase for Derek.\n\nGoddard, who became better known for his work in theme parks, said he wrote the script in two weeks.\n\nFilming took place in Sri Lanka in February 1981.\n\nThe original Tarzan was Lee Canahalin. He injured his knee in 1980 meaning he was reliant on his stuntman. His stuntman had to undergo an emergency appendectomy when filming started. This resulted in Canahalin being replaced by Miles O'Keefe.\n\nRichard Harris enjoyed working with the Dereks.\n\nThe film was widely panned upon its release. Film critic and historian Leonard Maltin considers this one of the worst films ever to appear in his popular \"TV, Movie and Video Guide\" (now simply \"Movie Guide\"): \"Deranged 'remake' lacks action, humor and charm; Forget about comparisons to Johnny Weissmuller; O'Keefe makes Elmo Lincoln seem like Edwin Booth.\" Leslie Halliwell described \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\" as \"certainly the worst of the Tarzan movies and possibly the most banal film so far made; even the animals give poor performances\". In\na discussion of Tarzan films, Thomas S. Hischak was also negative: \"Produced and directed without a shred of talent by John Derek, \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\" often ranks high in the lists of the worst movies ever made\".\n\nHowever, critic Roger Ebert offered a somewhat more positive review of \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\", awarding it two and a half stars out of a possible four. According to Ebert, the film was \"completely ridiculous, but at the same time it has a certain disarming charm.\" Ebert thought Harris's talents were completely wasted and the film's dramatic peak was \"incomprehensible,\" yet he praised the forthright depiction of the sexual passion and tension between Tarzan and Jane, which had more typically been downplayed in film adaptations of the characters: \"The Tarzan-Jane scenes strike a blow for noble savages, for innocent lust, for animal magnetism, and, indeed, for soft-core porn, which is ever so much sexier than the hard-core variety.\".\n\nReviewing the movie retrospectively for \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\", John Grant comments that the movie \"is widely regarded as the direst of the Tarzan movies, but it has enough good bits (including some spectacular photography and moments of exquisite wrongness) that, if cut by about 40 minutes, it would be highly regarded. As it is, it leaves a nasty taste: its intention seems to be to appeal to those who find eroticism in the sexual humiliation of women.\"\n\nDespite the negative reviews it received, the film was a success at the box office. It opened in 950 theatres in the United States, except New York, and was the highest-grossing film of the weekend with a gross of $6,700,809. It went on to gross US$36,565,280 in the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\"Tarzan, the Ape Man\" was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on June 8, 2004 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.\n\nThe Japanese manga series \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\" references this movie in chapter 265, the final chapter of the manga's third part, \"Stardust Crusaders\". Jōtarō Kūjō tests his grandfather Joseph Joestar with trivia questions, including \"Who's the female lead in the 1981 film, \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\"?\", which Joseph correctly answers with \"Bo Derek\". This scene is also featured in the last episode of the second season of the manga's 2012 anime adaptation.\n\nGary Goddard said he was going to write more films for the Dereks including one called \"Pirate Annie\". However financing for \"Annie\" was withdrawn when the studio, CBS, read the script and were unhappy with what they considered too small a role for Bo Derek.\n\n"}

The stock also provides a means for the shooter to firmly brace the gun and easily aim with stability by being held against the user's shoulder when shooting the gun, and helps to counter muzzle rise by transmitting recoil straight into the shooter's body.\n\nThe tiller of a crossbow is functionally the equivalent of the stock on a gun.\n\nThe term stock in reference to firearms dates to 1571 is derived from the Germanic word \"Stock\", meaning tree trunk, referring to the wooden nature of the gunstock.\n\nEarly hand cannons used a simple stick fitted into a socket in the breech end to provide a handle. The modern gunstock shape began to evolve with the introduction of the arquebus, a matchlock with a longer barrel and an actual lock mechanism, unlike the hand-applied match of the hand cannon. Firing a hand cannon requires careful application of the match while simultaneously aiming; the use of a matchlock handles the application of the slow match, freeing up a hand for support. With both hands available to aim, the arquebus could be braced with the shoulder, giving rise to the basic gunstock shape that has survived for over 500 years. This greatly improved the accuracy of the arquebus, to a level that would not be surpassed until the advent of rifled barrels.\n\nIronically, the stocks of muskets introduced during the European colonization of the Americas were repurposed as hand-to-hand war clubs by Native Americans and First Nations when fragile accessories were damaged or scarce ammunition exhausted. Techniques for gunstock hand weapons are being revived by martial arts such as Okichitaw.\n\nA gunstock is broadly divided into two parts (see above). The rear portion is the butt (1) and front portion is the fore-end (2). The fore-end supports and affixes the receiver, and relays the recoil impulse from the barrel. The butt interacts with the shooter's trigger hand while being braced against the shoulder for stability, and is further divided into the comb (3), heel (4), toe (5), and grip (6). The stock pictured has a thumbhole (7) style grip, which allows a more ergonomic vertical hold for the user's hand.\n\nIn some modern firearm designs, the lower receiver and handguard replace the fore-end stock, leaving only the butt portion for the stock.\n\nThe most basic breakdown of stock types is into one-piece and two-piece stocks. A one-piece stock is a single unit from butt to fore-end, such as that commonly found on conventional bolt-action rifles. Two-piece stocks use a separate piece for the butt and fore-end, such as that commonly found on break-action shotguns, and lever-action rifles and shotguns. Traditionally, two-piece stocks were easier to make, since finding a wood blank suitable for a long one-piece stock is harder than finding short blanks for a two-piece stock.\n\nIn traditional one-piece rifle stocks, the butt also varies in styles between the \"European\" type, which has a drop at the heel to favor quick shooting using iron sights; and \"American\" type, which the heel remains horizontal from the grip to favor more precision-oriented shooting using optical sights. There are also in-between designs (such as the Weatherby Mark V) with a \"halfway\" heel drop where the front half of the buttstock stays leveled.\n\nCollapsable or folding stocks are often seen on military-grade carbines, SMG/PDWs and their civilian-derived versions. A collapsible (or telescoping) stock makes the weapon more compact for storage, carrying and concealment, and is usually deployed just before shooting for better control. A butt hook, which is an attachment to the butt of the gun that is put under the shooter's arm to prevent the rifle from pivoting forward from the weight of the barrel is sometimes used in competitive rifle shooting. These stocks are also used on combat shotguns like the Franchi SPAS-12 to allow the stock to collapse when not in use.\n\nThe grip portion of the buttstock is held by the shooter's trigger hand during firing, and is the part of the butt that connects with the fore-end. The back part of the grip is called the tang. Many grips have roughened textures or even finger grooves engraved into the sides to increase the firmness of the shooter's hold. Some grips have a thumb rest (or thumb groove) carved near the tang to give a more ergonomic hold for the trigger finger.\n\nThe grip varies widely in styles. A \"straight grip\" stock (A) proceeds smoothly from toe to the trigger, giving a nearly horizontal holding angle for the trigger hand, while a full \"pistol grip\" stock (E) contains a separate stand-out grip piece, providing a nearly vertical angle for the trigger hand for maximal ergonomics, and is commonly found on modern military rifles such as the ubiquitous AK-47 and M16/M4 families of assault rifles. In between the two extremes, the \"semi-grip\" stock (B) is perhaps the most common sporting rifle stock, with a steeper angle cut into the stock to provide a more diagonal angle for the trigger hand. Modern target-style stocks have generally moved towards a fuller, more vertical grip, though built into the stock rather than made as a separate piece. \"Anschütz grip\" stocks (C), for example, use a nearly vertical grip, and many \"thumbhole grip\" stocks (D) are similar to pistol grips in shape.\n\nThe comb is another area of wide variation. Since the comb must support the shooter's cheek at a height that steadily aligns the aiming eye with the weapon's sights, higher sights such as telescopic sights require higher combs.\n\nThe simplest form is a \"straight\" comb (A), which is the default form seen in all traditional rifles with iron sights. The \"Monte Carlo\" comb (B) is commonly found on stocks designed for use with scopes, and features an elevated comb to lift the cheek higher, while keeping the heel of the stock low. If the elevated comb is of a rounded dome shape, it is often called a \"hogback\" comb. A \"cheekpiece\" (C) is a raised section on the \"side\" of the stock, which provides a more comformed support for the shooter's cheek. There is some confusion between these terms, as the features are often combined, with the raised \"rollover\" cheekpiece (D) extending to the top of the stock to form essentially a high Monte Carlo comb.\n\nSome modern buttstocks have a movable comb piece called a cheek rest or cheek rise, which offers adjustable comb height that tailors to the shooter's ergonomic preference.\n\nThe fore-ends tend to vary both in thickness, from the \"splinter\" fore-ends common on British side-by-side shotguns to the wide, flat bottomed \"beavertail\" fore-ends found on benchrest shooting guns, and in length, from the short AK-47 style to the long Mannlicher stock that runs all the way to the muzzle. Most common on sporting firearms is the \"half-stock\", which extends roughly half the length of the barrel.\n\nStock measurements are important regarding target rifle stocks if competing in IBS or NBRSA registered matches. The target rifle stocks must meet certain dimensional and configuration criteria according to the class of competition engaged in. Stock dimensioning is especially important with shotguns, where the typical front-bead-only sight requires a consistent positioning of the shooter's eye over the center of the barrel for good accuracy. When having a stock custom built or bent to fit, there are a number of measurements that are important.\n\n\nIn addition to ergonomic issues, the stock can also have a significant impact on the accuracy of the rifle. The key factors are:\nA well designed and well built wooden stock can provide the secure, stable base needed for an accurate rifle, but the properties of wood make it more difficult than more stable synthetic materials. Wood is still a top choice for aesthetic reasons, however, and solutions such as bedding provide the stability of a synthetic with the aesthetics of wood.\n\nBurst or automatic shoulder fired small arms can incorporate the \"straight-line\" recoil configuration. This layout places both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the barrel bore, a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire.\n\nA bump stock utilizes the natural recoil motion of a semi-automatic rifle to facilitate rapid fire similar to an automatic firearm without requiring any modification of internal mechanisms to convert the firearm to an automatic weapon. It consists of a sliding stock with an attached support step in front of the trigger. Pushing forward on the barrel, or forward grip, causes the gun to slide forward in the stock, \"bumping\" the trigger against the trigger finger that rests on the support step, firing the gun. The gun then recoils, moving the trigger backward, away from the finger. Continued forward pressure on the barrel or forward grip returns the trigger to the finger, repeating the cycle. The amount of forward pressure controls the rate of fire, which can reach several hundred rounds per minute.\n\nTraditionally, stocks are made from wood, generally a durable hardwood such as walnut. A growing option is the laminated wood stock, consisting of many thin layers of wood bonded together at high pressures with epoxy, resulting in a dense, stable composite.\n\nRegardless of the material actually employed, the general term \"furniture\" is often applied to gunstocks by curators, researchers and other firearm experts.\n\nFolding, collapsible, or removable stocks tend to be made from a mix of steel or alloy for strength and locking mechanisms, and wood or plastics for shape. Stocks for bullpup rifles must take into account the dimensions of the rifle's action, as well as ergonomic issues such as ejection.\n\nWhile walnut is the favored gunstock wood, many other woods are used, including maple, myrtle, birch, and mesquite. In making stocks from solid wood, one must take into account the natural properties and variability of woods. The grain of the wood determines the strength, and the grain should flow through the wrist of the stock and out the toe; having the grain perpendicular to these areas weakens the stock considerably.\n\nIn addition to the type of wood, how it is treated can have a significant impact on its properties. Wood for gunstocks should be slowly dried, to prevent grain collapse and splitting, and also to preserve the natural color of the wood; custom stockmakers will buy blanks that have been dried two to three years and then dry it for several additional years before working it into a stock. Careful selection can yield distinctive and attractive features, such as crotch figure, feathering, fiddleback, and burl, which can significantly add to the desirability of a stock. While a basic, straight grained blank suitable for a utilitarian stock might sell for US$20, an exhibition grade blank with superb figure could price in the range of US$2000. Blanks for one piece stocks are more expensive than blanks for two piece stocks, due to the greater difficulty in finding the longer blanks with desirable figure. Two piece stocks are ideally made from a single blank, so that the wood in both parts shows similar color and figure.\n\nLaminated wood consists of two or more layers of wood, impregnated with glue and attached permanently to each other. The combination of the two pieces of wood, if laid out correctly, results in the separate pieces moderating the effects of changes in temperature and humidity. Modern laminates consist of 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) thick sheets of wood, usually birch, which are impregnated with epoxy, laid with alternating grain directions, and cured at high temperatures and pressures. The resulting composite material is far stronger than the original wood, free from internal defects, and nearly immune to warping from heat or moisture. Typically, each layer of the laminate is dyed before laminating, often with alternating colors, which provides a pattern similar to wood grain when cut into shape, and with bright, contrasting colors, the results can be very striking. The disadvantage of laminate stocks is density, with laminates weighing about 4 to 5 ounces (110 to 140 g) more than walnut for a typical stock.\n\nWhile wood laminates have been available for many years on the custom market (and, in subdued form, in some military rifles), in 1987 Rutland Plywood, a maker of wood laminates, convinced Sturm, Ruger, Savage Arms, and U.S. Repeating Arms Company (Winchester) to display some laminate stocks on their rifles in a green, brown and black pattern (often called \"camo\"). The response was overwhelming, and that marked the beginning of laminated stocks on production rifles.\n\nWhile setup costs are high, once ready to produce, injection molding produces stocks for less than the cost of the cheapest wood stocks. Every stock is virtually identical in dimension, and requires no bedding, inletting, or finishing. The downsides are a lack of rigidity and thermal stability, which are side effects of the thermoplastic materials used for injection molding.\n\nA hand-laid composite stock is \"composed\" out of materials such as fiberglass, kevlar, graphite cloth, or some combination, saturated in an appropriate binder, placed into a mold to set, or solidify. The resulting stock is stronger and more stable than an injection-molded stock. It can also be as little as half the weight of an injection-molded stock. Inletting and bedding can be accomplished by molding in as part of the manufacturing proceess, machining in the inletting after the stock is finished, molding directly to the action as a separate process, or molding a machined metal component in place during manufacture. Finish is provided by a layer of gel coat applied to the mold before the cloth is laid up.\n\nSome high production firearms (such as the PPS-43, MP-40, and the Zastava M70B) make use of metal stocks in order to have a strong, thin stock that can be folded away in order to make the weapon more compact. Even a skeletal steel stock is often heavier than the equivalent wooden fixed stock. Consequentially, less cost-sensitive designs like the FN Minimi make use of aluminium or lighter-than-steel alloys. A few designs, like the Accuracy International Arctic Warfare, use a metal chassis which securely beds the components of the firearm, with non-structural synthetic panels attached for ergonomics.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the nature of the stock may change the legal status of the firearm. Examples of this are:\n\n\n"}
