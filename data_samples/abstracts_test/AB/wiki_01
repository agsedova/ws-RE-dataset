{"id": "1915189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915189", "title": "Pari passu", "text": "Pari passu\n\nPari passu is a Latin phrase that literally means \"with an equal step\" or \"on equal footing\". It is sometimes translated as \"ranking equally\", \"hand-in-hand\", \"with equal force\", or \"moving together\", and by extension, \"fairly\", \"without partiality\".\n\nThis term is commonly used in law. \"Black's Law Dictionary\" (8th ed., 2004) defines \"pari passu\" as \"proportionally; at an equal pace; without preference\". \n\nIn inheritance, an \"in pari passu\" (\"per capita\") distribution can be distinguished from a \"per stirpes\" (by family branch) distribution. \n\nFor example, suppose a testator had two children A and B. A has two children, and B has three. The testator leaves his entire estate to his grandchildren in equal shares \"in pari passu\", each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate. If the testator left his entire estate to his grandchildren \"per stirpes\" (by family branch), the children of A would share one half of the estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them. \n\nThe problem with a per capita \"in pari passu\" distribution in the example given is as follows. Assume A dies before B. On A's death a distribution could not be made to his or her children: they would have to await the death of B – on the assumption that B could have additional children, and thereby consequently all grandchildren (of both A and B) would be entitled to less than one fifth each.\n\nThis term is also often used in the lending area and in bankruptcy proceedings, where creditors are said to be paid \"pari passu\", or each creditor is paid \"pro rata\" in accordance with the amount of his claim. Here its meaning is \"equally and without preference\".\nThere have been cases where decisions were based on different interpretations of the term.\n\nIn the European Union, as the result of the Greek government-debt crisis, a retroactive Collective action clause passed by the Greek government with the support of the ECB and IMF, enabled the debtor (who also controlled the courts) to impose a 70% loss on the creditors, more than 75% of whom had voted in favour of the cut. In this case, \"pari passu\" means that all private-sector investors are equally treated.\n\n\n"}
