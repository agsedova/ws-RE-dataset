He played five One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Scotland, all in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. His best ODI bowling figures were two for 24 against Bangladesh in a match where the Bangladeshis were limited to 183, but the Scots wilted in the low chase and Butt, coming in at ten, could only score one run.\n\nHe played first-class cricket since October 1983, when he scored 40 not out and took one wicket in a drawn game against Sukkur in the 1983–84 Patron's Trophy. His career in Pakistan included mainly one-day games, and only yielded one five-wicket-haul – in the 1984–85 Patron's Trophy against a Lahore Division side where he took five for 53 in the second innings.\n\nIn 1998 he made his debut for Scotland, in a Benson & Hedges Cup game against Yorkshire, where he was named Man of the Match after taking three wickets for 42. However, Yorkshire still won the match by three wickets. His international debut came in the 1998 Triple Crown Tournament, where he ended with the bowling analysis of 10–3–14–1 against Ireland, although this was a minor match that did not have List A status. Butt also played for Scotland in the 2001 ICC Trophy, where he took five for 11 against Fiji, but only got one wicket in the remaining seven games. He did, however, top score in Scotland's five-wicket win over UAE.\n\nButt missed Scotland's first season in English National League cricket in 2003, but came back in 2004 with three wickets against Yorkshire. In a season where Scotland only managed two victories, Butt took 11 wickets at an average of 31.72. He also played three first-class matches in the 2004 Intercontinental Cup, where he was more successful, as he was Scotland's top wicket-taker with 16, including his second career five-for in an eight-wicket win over Ireland – in a match where his bowling yielded nine for 72 in total. Butt's contribution played a major part in Scotland's qualification for the semi-finals stage, and he also took the first four wickets of the second innings in the final against Canada, which Scotland won by an innings and 86 runs.\n\nButt played three matches in the 2005 season for Scotland, taking three wickets but being expensive, before he tested positive for MDMA during a match with Somerset. He was subsequently banned from cricket for a year.\n\nButt died in his sleep, aged 42, in Lahore on 30 November 2009.\n\nButt's wife Pakistan born Tara now a UK national, claimed that she has strong suspicions that Butt has faked his own death. She believes that the reason for faking his death is the fact that despite of using all possible resources she is unable to get the death certificate yet. Due to Butt's alleged involvement with drugs and affairs, Tara thinks the motive behind faking death is either the drugs or another woman. However, Heriots Cricket Club's representative said they don't find any reason to believe that Butt faked his own death.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2067260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067260", "title": "Value (semiotics)", "text": "Value (semiotics)\n\nIn semiotics, the value of a sign depends on its position and relations in the system of signification and upon the particular codes being used.\n\nValue is the sign as it is determined by the other signs in a semiotic system. For linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, the content of a sign in linguistics is ultimately determined and delimited not by its internal content, but by what surrounds it: the synonyms \"redouter\" (\"to dread\"), \"craindre\" (\"to fear\"), and \"avoir peur\" (\"to be afraid\") have their particular values because they exist in opposition to one another. If two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its \"extra something\" because it would have nothing to distinguish itself from.\n\nFor de Saussure, this suggests that thought is a chaotic nebula until linguistic structure dissects it and holds its divisions in equilibriums. This is akin to the philosophy of \nSir William Hamilton, who indirectly influenced Saussure and believed that the mind could only grasp an idea through distinguishing it from something that it is not. He reasoned that the two objects would otherwise collapse together for the mind and become indistinguishable from one another.\n\nValue determines the sign as a whole, not just meaning. Sound is also an indeterminate nebulous. The arbitrary nature of the sign and the flexibility of sound means that an agreed upon contrast is required. For example, \"zena\" is useful because it stands in contrast to \"zenb\" within an agreed upon system. Without the distinction, \"zena\" could be used for absolutely anything, or indeed nothing, making communication an impossibility.\n\nIt is only the sign as a whole that has value. Linguistic structure simultaneously unites sound with thought and decomposes \"thought-sound\" into linguistic units, or signs, consisting of a signifier and a signified (sound-pattern and concept, respectively). When analysed in isolation, the sound-pattern or concept are pure differences, emerging from series of sound-patterns or concepts that they themselves are dependent upon. But in isolation, they are mere abstractions, because neither can exist without the connection between the two. It is the sign as a whole, then, that is the concrete entity of structural linguistics, which is not a pure difference, a negative term, but a pure value, a positive term that is merely in opposition or resistance to all the other signs in the system.\n\nDrawing from the original definition proposed by Saussure (1857–1913), a sign has two parts:\n\nThis emphasises that the sign is merely a symbol for the class of object referred to. Hence, the lexical word or noun \"box\" evokes a range of possibility from cheap card to gold-encrusted container. The reader or audience may not be able to see the particular box referred to but will be aware of its likely form from the other signs accompanying the use of the particular word.\n\nHowever, there is no necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. There is nothing inherently \"boxy\" about the component sounds or letters that comprise the noun \"box\"—the scope of onomatopoeia is limited when forming a language. All that is necessary is that the relevant group of people should decide to use that word to denote the object. Evidence that this is the correct view comes from the fact that each language can encode signifiers with whichever signified they wish to communicate. Hence, for example, the letters comprising \"air\" signify what humans breathe in English, and what fish breathe in Malay, i.e. water.\n\nThis makes a system of signs a very flexible mechanism for communicating meaning, but one which is conditioned by history and culture, i.e. once a sign acquires a commonly accepted meaning in each language, it cannot arbitrarily be changed by any one person, but it is able to change diachronically.\n\nFurther, Roman Jakobson (1896–1982) proposes that when a group of signs is used, there is an emotive function that reflects the speaker's attitude to the topic of his or her discourse. Language and the other coding systems are the means whereby one self-aware individual communicates with another. By selecting particular signs and placing them in a context, the addresser is making a cognitive use of the sign system to refer to his or her own social, moral, ethical, political or other values.\n\nBecause signs may have multiple meanings, a sign can only be interpreted in its context. Saussure believed that any one sign takes its value from its position and relations with other signs within the linguistic system. Modern semiotics draws its inspiration from the work of, \"inter alios\", Roland Barthes (1915–1980), who argued that semiotics should expand its scope and concern: \"...any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification\" (1967, 9).\n\nIn the system to be interrogated, the relations will be both weak and strong, positive and negative, qualitative and quantitative, etc. In this, a sign cannot be attributed a value outside its context (although what is signified may have connotative meaning(s) that resonate outside the context), and what is \"not\" present can be just as significant as what is present.\n\nIn a slightly different context of critique through the \"archaeological\" and \"genealogical\" methods for the study of knowledge, Michel Foucault (1926–1984) used the idea of discontinuity as a means to \"revalorise\" elements of knowledge. In this, he considered the silences and lacunae within a text to be as significant as express statements. In both systems, the specific processes of analysis examine these gaps to reveal whose interests are served by the omissions. Such analysis is particularly useful to identify which questions are left unasked.\n\nThe commutation test can be used to identify which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered to determine the extent to which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the paradigms and code to which the signifiers used belong.\n\nParadigmatic analysis compiles a list of the signifiers present in the text. This set comprises the paradigm. The analyst then compares and contrasts the set with absent signifiers, i.e. with other signifiers that might have been chosen. This reveals the significance of the choices made which might have been required because of technical production constraints or the limitations of the individual's own technique, or because of the tropes, generic conventions, style and rhetorical purpose of the work. The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‘value’ of specific items in a system.\n\n"}

The practical result is that inserting a Barlow lens magnifies the image.\nA real barlow lens is not a single glass element, because that would generate chromatic aberration, and spherical aberration if the lens is not aspheric. More common configurations use three or more elements for achromatic correction or apochromatic correction and higher image quality.\n\nIn its astronomical use, a Barlow lens may be placed immediately before an eyepiece to effectively decrease the eyepiece's focal length by the amount of the Barlow's divergence. Since the magnification provided by a telescope and eyepiece is equal to the telescope's focal length divided by the eyepiece's focal length, this has the effect of increasing the magnification of the image.\n\nAstronomical Barlow lenses are rated for the amount of magnification they induce. Most commonly, Barlow lenses are 2x or 3x, but adjustable Barlows are also available. The power of an adjustable Barlow lens is changed by adding an extension tube between the Barlow and the eyepiece to increase the magnification. \n\nThe amount of magnification is one more than the distance between the Barlow lens and the eyepiece lens, when the distance is measured in units of the focal length of the Barlow lens. A standard Barlow lens is housed in a tube that is one Barlow focal-length long, so that a focusing lens inserted into the end of the tube will be separated from the Barlow lens at the other end by one Barlow focal-length, and hence produce a 2x magnification over and above what the eyepiece would have produced alone. If the length of a standard 2x Barlow lens' tube is doubled, then the lenses are separated by 2 Barlow focal lengths and it becomes a 3x Barlow. Similarly, if the tube length is tripled, then the lenses are separated by 3 Barlow focal lengths and it becomes a 4x Barlow, and so on.\n\nA common misconception is that higher magnification equates to a higher-quality image. However, in practice, the quality of the image generally depends on the quality of the optics (lenses) and viewing conditions, not on magnification.\n\nTeleconverters are variations on Barlow lenses that have been adapted for photographic use. A teleconverter increases the effective focal length of the photographic lens it is attached to, making it a telephoto lens. A true telephoto lens uses a configuration similar to a Barlow lens to obtain a shorter tube length for a given focal length.\n\nIn microscopy the Barlow lens is used to increase working distance and \"decrease\" magnification. The lenses are \"objective lenses\" that are mounted in front of the microscope's last objective element. Barlow lenses for microscopes can be found with magnifications ranging from 0.3× to 2×. Some standard lenses are 2×, which decreases the working distance by half and doubles the magnification, 0.75× (3/4×), which increases the working distance by 4/3× (1.33×) and decreases the magnification by 0.75×, and a 0.5× Barlow doubles the working distance and halves the magnification.\n\n"}

The falls are formed as the river plunges over beds of hard Lower Pennant Sandstone just before meeting the River Neath flowing down the Vale of Neath. They are home to Europe's largest electricity-generating water wheel.\n\nThe River Dulais rises on Mynydd y Drum in the western Brecon Beacons. It flows down the Dulais Valley, through the villages of Seven Sisters and Crynant, before reaching its confluence with the River Neath after about . Here it flows over a ridge of Pennant sandstone, entering a gorge that was carved by meltwater from a glacier 20,000 years ago. Originally the falls were nearer the sea, but the water has eroded the rock and cut its way back to its present location. The River Dulais is prone to flash floods when heavy rain falls in its catchment area.\n\nPower has been drawn from the waterfall since 1584, when it first provided energy used in the manufacture of copper, using ore imported from Cornwall. The copper-works ceased to operate early in the 17th century, and the site was later used for corn-milling and later as a tinplate works. The weir and waterwheel were added during the 19th century. The waterwheel used today is a modern steel structure. It is the largest waterwheel generating electricity in Europe, with a diameter of .

It boasts five red silicon pods that are designed to improve the strike zone, it also comes equipped with TPU fins that are designed to enhance touch and control.\n\nIn September 2011, Nike revealed the latest incarnation of their signature power/accuracy boots; the Nike T90 Laser IV. This latest incarnation did away with the silicon pods and TPU rubber fins of the Laser III, and introduced 'strips' of hard rubber to the forefoot which shift and bend with the movements of the foot - with Nike coining the name 'Adaptive Shield' for this new technology. The Laser IV also features TPU swerve fins to generate friction and ball spin, and a Power Zone that improves strength and accuracy when striking the ball.\n\nWith the launch of the Nike T90 Laser IV, Nike were also keen to re-invent the silo for the modern striker. As such, the boot's weight was decreased by 20% to around (in a US size 9 boot), and the Laser IV's silhouette and shape were slimmed down from the wide-fitting Laser III.\n\nLaunched in two colourways, White/Black/Total Orange and Black/Silver/Yellow, the Nike T90 Laser IV hit the pitch early when Wesley Sneijder wore them in Inter Milan's clash with Palermo at the start of the 2011-12 Serie A season.\n\nThe boot's official on-pitch debut was on 18 September 2011, when Wayne Rooney wore them in Manchester United's Premier League match against Chelsea.\n\n"}

The rose as a symbol of secrecy has an ancient history.\n\nThe rose has held a deeply symbolic significance in many times and cultures as a symbol of maternal creativity and of the yoni or feminine generative power. The literal rose and its essence or attar has also played a role in religious and spiritual rites which ofttimes would have been held in secret.\n\nThe rose has sometimes been said to have been the emblem of the god Horus in ancient Egypt. However, the gods in Egypt were usually associated with the lotus. The idea of Horus being linked to the rose probably arises from Greek and Roman cultural cross-transmission of myths from Egypt. Firstly, the rose's connotation of secrecy dates back also to Greek mythology. Aphrodite gave a rose to her son Eros, the god of love; he, in turn, gave it to Harpocrates, the god of silence and a Greek name for a form of Horus, to ensure that his mother's indiscretions (or those of the gods in general, in other accounts) were not disclosed. Secondly, in Egypt, the rose was actually sacred to Isis but this appears to have been during the Roman period of Egyptian history—\"Probably due to assimilation with the goddess Aphrodite (Venus), during the Roman period, the rose was used in her worship.\" \n\nLater, the Greeks and Romans translated the god's Egyptian name Heru-pa-khered as Harpocrates and regarded him as the god of silence. The association of Harpocrates with silence and secrecy originates from a misunderstanding of Egyptian depictions of the god. Heru-pa-khered was represented as a naked youth with a finger-to-mouth gesture—in Egyptian artwork this gesture imitates the hieroglyph for child and is used to represent youth, but was misunderstood by Greeks and Romans as a gesture for silence.\n\nPaintings of roses on the ceilings of Roman banquet rooms were also a reminder that things said under the influence of wine (\"sub vino\") should also remain \"sub rosa\". \n\nIn the Middle Ages a rose suspended from the ceiling of a council chamber similarly pledged all present (those under the rose) to secrecy.\n\nIn Christian symbolism, the phrase \"sub rosa\" has a special place in confessions. Pictures of five-petalled roses were often carved on confessionals, indicating that the conversations would remain secret. The phrase has also been understood to refer to the mysterious virginal conception of Christ.\n\nThe rose is also an esoteric symbol of Rosicrucianism which was often considered to be a secret society or brotherhood.\nIn the 16th century, the symbol of Henry VII of England was the stylised Tudor dynasty rose. A large image of the rose covered the ceiling of the private chamber where decisions of state were made in secret.\n\nIn current times, the term is used by the Scottish Government for a specific series of \"off the record\" meetings.\n"}

In 1970, she made a cameo appearance as Lenore on the AW spin-off, \"Somerset\". Lenore was in a popular romance with attorney Walter Curtin (Val Dufour) who defended Lenore for the murder of Wayne Addison (Robert Milli) but who secretly was guilty of killing Wayne himself. Her storyline had Lenore being a bitter enemy with Liz Matthews (then Nancy Wickwire) who was in love with Wayne but blamed Lenore for stealing his affections.\n\nAfter leaving \"Another World\", she took over the role of Ann Tyler on \"All My Children\". As the daughter of the wealthy Phoebe and Charles Tyler, she married handsome lawyer Paul Martin. After Ann gave birth to a baby who died suddenly, she underwent a mental breakdown, forcing Paul and Phoebe to commit her to a mental hospital. She played the role for six years, leaving All My Children in 1977.

The daughter of Philip II of Macedon and Olympias of Epirus, she was the only full sibling of Alexander the Great. Her other siblings include half sisters Thessalonike and Cynane, and half-brother Philip III of Macedon.\n\nCleopatra grew up in the care of her mother in Pella. In 338 BC, Cleopatra stayed in Pella with her father while her mother Olympias fled to exile in Epirus with her Molossian brother Alexander I of Epirus (Cleopatra's uncle), and Cleopatra's brother Alexander fled to Illyria. Soon Philip felt he had to ally himself to Alexander I by offering his daughter's hand in marriage. A large wedding between Cleopatra and her uncle Alexander I of Epirus was held in 336 BC. It was at the celebration of her nuptials, which took place on a magnificent scale at Aegae in Macedon, that Philip II was murdered.\n\nImmediately after her father's murder, Cleopatra and Alexander went from Macedon back to Epirus. Soon after, the couple had two children, Neoptolemus II of Epirus and Cadmeia. It is believed that Alexander and Cleopatra kept in close contact while he was on his conquest to the east. In 332 BC Alexander had sent booty home for both his mother and sister, as well as his close friends.\n\nIn 334 BC, Cleopatra's husband crossed the Adriatic Sea to the Italian peninsula to campaign against several Italic tribes, the Lucanians and Bruttii, on behalf of the Greek colony Taras, leaving her as regent of Epirus. She was involved as recipient and sender of official shipments of grain during a widespread shortage around 334 BC. According to an inscription from Cyrene, Libya she was the recipient of 50,000 'medimni' of grain, and shipped the surplus to Corinth. Alexander I conquered Heraclea, took Sipontum, and captured both Consentia and Terin, but was eventually killed in battle in 331 BC, leaving the young heir, Neoptolemus too young for the throne.\n\nCleopatra ruled Epirus in the meantime. It was an Epirote custom that the woman of a family became head of household when her husband died and their son(s) were too young, unlike the rest of Greece. It was only fitting for the powerful queen to assume control. When her husband was killed, an embassy from Athens was dispatched to deliver condolences.\n\nCleopatra was seemingly acting as the religious head of state for the people of Molossia. Her name appears on a list of \"Theorodokoi\" (\"\"welcomers of sacred ambassadors\"\"), in the recently established Epirote alliance. Cleopatra was significantly the only female on the list. Her position as official welcomer would have allowed her to keep a finger on whatever was happening anywhere in Greece.\n\nAfter the death of her brother, Cleopatra was sought in marriage by several of his generals, who thought to strengthen their influence with the Macedonians by a connection with the sister of Alexander the Great. Leonnatus is first mentioned as putting forward a claim to her hand, and he represented to Eumenes that he received a lettered promise of marriage if he came to Pella. Cleopatra had extended her hand because she knew Leonnatus had the ambition and ability to overthrow the new mentally unfit king Philip III of Macedon if they married. Nonetheless before his arrival, Leonnatus in an attempt enhance his claim to the throne, lifted the siege from the rebellious Greeks in Lamia and rescued Antipater, however he was killed in action, so the marriage never occurred. \n\nPerdiccas next attempted to win her marriage. After his death, her hand was sought by Cassander, Lysimachus, and Antigonus. She refused, however, all these offers. She escaped to Sardis, where she was kept for years in a sort of honourable captivity by Antigonus.\n\nAn interesting event took place in Sardis. A frustrated Antipater publicly accused Cleopatra of being involved with Perdiccas in her half sister Cynane's death. Cleopatra would not submit so easily, however, and fought back.\n\nEventually, Cleopatra acceded to a proposal from Ptolemy, but before it occurred, she was captured. After being brought back to Sardis, Cleopatra was assassinated in 308 BC, reputedly by order of Antigonus. Despite afterwards executing the assassins and giving her a beautiful funeral in her honor, he knew she represented too much power to remain alive.\n\nCarney, Elizabeth Donnelly. \"Women and Monarchy in Macedonia\".

Its primary military roles include maritime patrol, surveillance, and air transport. Its largest user is Turkey, which has 59 aircraft.\n\nThe project was a joint venture between Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) and Indonesian Aerospace (\"PT. Dirgantara Indonesia\"), formerly known as IPTN, which formed Airtech International to manage the programme. The partnership applied only to the Series 10 and Series 100/110, with later versions being developed independently. Over 230 of all versions of CN-235 are in service and have accumulated more than 500,000 flight hours.\n\nDesign began in January 1980 with the first flight on 11 November 1983. Spanish and Indonesian certification was on 20 June 1986; the first flight of the production aircraft was on 19 August 1986 and CASA's FAA type approval was granted on 3 December 1986. The aircraft entered service on 1 March 1988\n\nIn 1994 the Irish Air Corps took delivery of two CN-235 maritime surveillance aircraft having used one on loan from CASA from 1992 while their own aircraft were being built.\n\nIn 1995, CASA launched development of a stretched CN-235 as the C-295. In December 2002, the Colombian Navy ordered two CN-235 for patrol and anti-drug trafficking missions.\n\nIn April 2005, Venezuela ordered two CN-235 maritime surveillance aircraft plus 10 transport planes but the operation was halted because the United States government refused to allow the transfer of what they deemed to be US technology in the avionics.\n\nIn January 2006, Thailand placed an order with Indonesian Aerospace for ten aircraft, six for the Ministry of Defence and four for the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nIn December 2007, Spain ordered two CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft for the Guardia Civil, for delivery 2008–2009.\n\nOne CN-235 MPA aircraft was delivered by Indonesian Aerospace to the Indonesian defence ministry in June 2008.\n\nIn August 2006, three CASA CN-235-10 aircraft remained in airline service, in Africa, with Safair (two) and Tiko Air (one). Asian Spirit operated a lone CN-235-220 in the Philippines, correct as of June/July 2007.\n\nIn early July 2008, the Mexican Navy announced that it would purchase six CASA CN-235s from Spain.

They plan to buy two more aircraft for VIP and cargo duties. The Air Force is also interested in the maritime patrol version of the aircraft.\n\nAlthough the CN-235 was initially designed as a military transport, it was also offered as a commercial airliner. However, it did not achieve much success in this role compared to competing 50-seat commuter aircraft such as the ATR 42 and De Havilland Canada DHC-8. Iberia LAE, Spain's flag carrier, bought four CN-235s from CASA for regional routes, and in 1992 Aerolíneas Argentinas (then also a subsidiary of Iberia) ordered two aircraft to be operated by its subsidiary, Austral.\n\nIn 2015, Indonesian Aerospace announced that they are currently planning a new variant of CN-235 called N-245 that will be designed specially for civil operation and able to carry up to 60 passengers. Previously also known as CN-235NG, this variant planned to be fully launched after Indonesian Aerospace N-219 project is done and expected to be fully certified in 2019. Further planned development is N-270, a stretched version of N-245 that able to carry up to 70–90 passengers and planned to be developed between 2019–2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaritime patrol version with 6 hardpoints to carry AM-39 Exocet-Missiles or Mk.46-Torpedoes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 18 Oct 1992, Merpati Nusantara Airlines (Registration PK-MNN) CN-235-10 Flight 5601 crashed on Garut, Indonesia, killing all 31 people on board \n\nOn 19 January 2001, a Turkish Air Force CN-235 training mission crashed near Kayseri after entering a spin from which recovery was not possible, killing all 3 people on board\n\nOn 16 May 2001, a Turkish Air Force CN-235 crashed after the pilot lost control, killing all 34 people on board.\n\nOn 18 May 2001, a Turkish Navy CN-235 crashed after the pilot lost control after reaching an altitude of just 100 feet, killing all 4 people on board.\n\nOn 29 August 2001, Binter Mediterráneo Flight 8261 (Registration EC-FBC) crash-landed at Málaga, Spain, killing four of the 44 passengers and crew aboard.

Twinning on the prism-planes is of frequent occurrence, giving rise to pseudo-hexagonal groups like those of aragonite. The colour is iron-black, and the lustre metallic and brilliant; on exposure to light, however, the crystals soon become dull. Stephanite is an important ore of silver in some mining camps.\n\nStephanite occurs as a late-stage mineral with other ores of silver in hydrothermal veins. Associated minerals include proustite, acanthite, native silver, tetrahedrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite. Localities which have yielded good crystallized specimens are Freiberg and Gersdorf near Rosswein in Saxony, Chañarcillo in Chile, and exceptionally Cornwall.

Each story is a self-contained adventure, but throughout the series, Earl Dumarest, the protagonist, searches for clues to the location of his home world, Earth. Production of a television version of the series is set to begin in 2018.\n\nThe stories are set in a far future galactic culture that is fragmented and without any central government. Dumarest was born on Earth, but had stowed away on a spaceship when he was a young boy and was caught. Although a stowaway discovered on a spaceship was typically ejected to space, the captain took pity on the boy and allowed him to work and travel on the ship. When the story opens in \"The Winds of Gath\", Dumarest has traveled so long and so far that he does not know how to return to his home planet and no-one has ever heard of it, other than as a myth or legend.\n\nIt becomes clear that someone or something has deliberately concealed Earth's location. The Cyclan, an organization of humans surgically altered to be emotionless (known as Cybers), and on occasion able to link with the brains of previously living Cybers (the better to think logically), seem determined to stop him from finding Earth. Additionally, the Cyclan seeks a scientific discovery that Dumarest possesses, stolen from them and passed to him by a dying thief, which would vastly increase their already considerable power.\n\nAlso appearing in many of the books is the humanitarian Church of Universal Brotherhood. Its monks are spread throughout many worlds as are the Cyclan, the two being arch-enemies - which does not make the Church Dumarest's ally, but in some instances they support each other.\n\nEarl Dumarest, the protagonist of the series, is a galactic adventurer, sometime bodyguard, mercenary, gladiator, prospector, hunter, gambler and starship jack of all trades. Dumarest, as he is most often referred to in the books, is on a quest to return to the lost planet of his birth amongst the diverse and disparate worlds of the milky way galaxy. His home planet is Earth. In all of the books the notion of there being a planet called Earth is laughable to most of the people he meets, and for those who have heard the name, it is only as a myth from the deep past often referred to alongside gamblers' paradises such as , Bonanza and the mythical El Dorado.\n\nThe Cyclan are a widespread organization dedicated to bringing order to the galaxy by means of pure logic. Their primary agents, Cybers, are trained from childhood in countless mental disciplines involving mathematics and reasoning, and are modified at puberty to be unable to experience any emotion. Each Cyber also possesses a biotech implant called “Homochon Elements”. These implants enable each Cyber to enter a trance-like state which enables instantaneous communication with the Cyclan central intelligence, even over interstellar distances. This central intelligence is a gestalt organism consisting of the disembodied minds of former Cybers whose mental prowess has been demonstrated to be of value but whose bodies have grown too old to continue functioning. The ultimate reward to which all Cybers aspire is to be incorporated into the central intelligence.\n\nFor these reasons, Cybers have an uncanny ability to extrapolate future events from existing data, and are highly prized (and highly paid) as advisors to rulers across the galaxy. The Cyclan publicly insist that they do not command or interfere, they merely advise, and this also increases their credibility among those who seek their service. However, the Cyclan pursue their own agenda, and while they provide valuable service to maintain their reputation, those whom they advise are manipulated even as they are aided. While incapable of malice, the Cyclan are thoroughly ruthless and willing to sacrifice individuals or worlds to their logically derived vision of the greater good. It is irrelevant to them whether or not the mass of humanity still handicapped by emotion shares this vision.\n\nIt is implied throughout the series that the Cyclan has something to do with the knowledge of Earth having been lost or destroyed in the distant past, and that they strive to keep that knowledge secret. This hidden agenda puts them at odds with Dumarest from the outset of the series.\n\nThe Hausia is a network of information brokers who operate on most worlds that engage in interstellar commerce. With a galactic reputation as fair but shrewd negotiators, and consistently driven by the profit motive, Hausi are neither noble nor malicious. Dumarest frequently deals with them because as long as a mutually beneficial business arrangement can be reached, their lack of a hidden agenda makes them predictable and generally trustworthy.\n\nThe Church of Universal Brotherhood is a decentralized humanitarian organization whose “monks” roam the galaxy giving comfort and alleviating suffering wherever they can. While they do not believe suffering holds intrinsic merit - they refuse to enjoy luxury or privilege of station above what is available to the most lowly of those to whom they minister. Although this appearance is not intended to deceive, it occasionally blinds those who disparage or underestimate them to the fact that each monk is a highly educated, highly trained agent of the central Church.\n\nThe Free Traders are small, independently owned and operated merchant starships and their crews. Free traders often invest speculatively in their cargoes in the hope of finding a lucrative market, or carry commissioned cargo and paying passengers when available.\n\nThe Terridae is a secretive and paranoid sect that shares Dumarest’s mission: to find Earth. They have been awaiting “The Event” (the discovery of Earth) for thousands of years. As they age, they spend more and more of their lives in self-contained stasis chambers (caskets) - the oldest only awakening for short periods every few decades, to prolong their lifespan until The Event occurs.\n\nThe Original People is a mysterious and highly fragmented sect that believes all humanity originated on one world - Earth (also known as Terra).

It is native to the western Mediterranean region. Common names include gum rockrose, labdanum, common gum cistus, and brown-eyed rockrose.\n\nIt is a shrub growing tall and wide. The leaves are evergreen, lanceolate, 3–10 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, dark green above and paler underneath. The flowers are 5–8 cm diameter, with 5 papery white petals, usually with a red to maroon spot at the base, surrounding the yellow stamens and pistils. The whole plant is covered with the sticky exudate of fragrant resin, the source of labdanum, used in herbal medicine and perfumery.\n\n\"C. ladanifer\" is particularly well suited to the Continentalized Mediterranean climate, standing both long summer droughts and cold weather. It is an extremely aggressive plant which has taken over much of former farmland and grasslands in the mountain regions of central Spain and much of southern Portugal. In Spanish it is known as \"Jara pringosa\" meaning \"sticky shrub\". In Portuguese it is known as \"esteva\". It has been found to have mycorrhizal associations with \"Boletus edulis\", \"Boletus rhodoxanthus\", and \"Laccaria laccata\".\n\nThe wide distribution and morphological variation of \"C. ladanifer\" across northern Africa, the Iberian peninsula, and southern France has resulted in the recognition of three sub-species: subspp. \"ladanifer\", \"sulcatus\", and \"africanus\".\n\n\n\"C. ladanifer\" is placed within the \"C. salvifolius\" group within white and whitish pink flowered clade of \"Cistus\" species.\n\nPhylogenetic and divergence dating methods found that \"C. ladanifer\" diverged during the Pleistocene, long after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar around 5 mya, which supports a hypothesis of dispersal for this species. Although its seeds fall close to the maternal plant, \"C. ladanifer\" may have successfully dispersed due to its preference for disturbed habitats.\n\nIt is a popular ornamental plant, grown for its strongly resin-scented foliage and conspicuous flowers. Its leaves yield a fragrant oleoresin known as labdanum, used in perfumes, especially as a fixative. (\"Laudanum\" is quite common name for opium-containing preparations, which does not relate to \"labdanum\" in any way.)\n\nThis plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n"}

He served as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the constituency of Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. He was first elected in 1998 and was re-elected in 1999, 2003 and 2006. He has also worked for a number of other development organizations in promoting good governance, transparent and accountable parliaments and effective political parties.\n\nDeveaux was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The youngest of five children, he attended school in Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia and Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, graduating from Cole Harbour District High School in 1984. His Father, Eugene \"Jeep\" Deveaux was the municipal councillor for the community for 24 years, from 1972 to 1996.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986, Deveaux attended St. Mary's University, studying for a Bachelor of Commerce. Prior to finishing his degree, he was accepted at Osgoode Hall Law School and graduated from York University in 1989. Among other noted professors, Deveaux was taught by Louise Arbour.\n\nIn 1989, after completing law school, Deveaux articled with the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General at the Ministry of Labour Legal Services Branch, between 1989 and 1990 and continued to work at that location until 1992. As a Crown Attorney for the Ontario Ministry of Labour he prosecuted corporations that violated the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He also represented workers before administrative tribunals commissioned under the Employment Standards Act.\n\nIn 1992, Deveaux returned to Nova Scotia where he worked first with the City of Halifax, and then with the Nova Scotia Department of Justice as a Crown Attorney. From 1993 to 1996, he worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Labour as a Legislation and Policy Review Officer. In that position, he worked with labour and management in drafting the new Occupational Health and Safety Act.\n\nIn 1995, Deveaux was selected to work with the United Nations International Labour Organization in China. He worked in Beijing with the Chinese Government, employers and unions to draft workplace protection legislation. From 1996 until his election in 1998, Deveaux worked with the Nova Scotia Workers' Adviser Program, representing injured workers.\n\nIn 1998, Deveaux was one of 19 Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (NDP) MLAs elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the first minority parliament in the history of Nova Scotia. During his second term, Deveaux was appointed Deputy Speaker in the House of Assembly.\n\nDeveaux was re-elected in 2003 during the second minority government in Nova Scotia history. He was appointed House Leader for the Official Opposition. During this term Deveaux was the author of the significant amendments to the Nova Scotia Labour Standards Code, ensuring the passage of expanded vacation benefits, access to overtime pay, and the establishment of sick leave. In addition, the amendments adopted a minimum wage review committee that has subsequently resulted in a minimum wage within Nova Scotia that has increased significantly. In 2004 he also worked closely with MLAs from other parties to advocate for the passage of the French-language Services Act, providing for the first time a guarantee of access to provincial services for francophone Nova Scotians.\n\nIn 2006, Deveaux was re-elected for the fourth time and continued his role as House Leader for the Official Opposition. Among other legislative initiatives, Deveaux was an advocate for the community safety, directly resulting in the passage of the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act by the Conservative Government of the day.\n\nDuring his terms in office, Deveaux was the NDP critic (shadow minister) for Justice, Acadian Affairs, Education, Finance and the Treasury and Policy Board.\n\nIn 2001 Deveaux began his first assignment in the field of international democratic governance. Between 2001 and 2006 he worked for the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) offices in Kosovo, Cambodia, Egypt and Iraq. There he drafted parliamentary rules of procedure and legislation, including the Kosovo Access to Information Act, and provided consultations and advice to MPs and senior government officials. He was Head of Mission for elections observations in Palestine in 2005.\n\nOn January 24, 2007, Deveaux announced he was resigning his position as an NDP MLA to accept an appoint with the United Nations in Vietnam as the Senior Technical Adviser to the National Assembly of Vietnam.\n\nIn August 2008, Deveaux was appointed Parliamentary Development Policy Adviser to the United Nations Development Programme based in New York City. He was responsible for the Global Programme for Parliamentary Strengthening (GPPS), a project that provided support to parliaments in Africa and the Arab states. In addition, Deveaux provided technical advice to the more than 70 parliaments in countries where UNDP has projects with those national parliaments, including the parliaments of Guyana, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Cambodia and Turkmenistan.\n\nIn 2011, since the Arab Spring, Deveaux worked extensively in the Arab region in support of the development of political parties, constituent assembly and parliaments in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. This work resulted in the development of a multimillion-dollar programme in support of parliaments and political parties in the Arab Region, funded by the Government of Belgium.\n\nIn 2012 Deveaux was one of the first international experts to assess the Assembly of the Union - the Parliament of Myanmar - meeting with the leaders of all the major parties in the parliament and recommending significant interventions in support of the institution.\n\nDeveaux was also instrumental in the creation of social media portals which promote parliamentary development and the political empowerment of women - namely, Agora, a web portal developed by UNDP, NDI, the World Bank, the European Commission and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA); and the International Knowledge Network of Women in Politics (iKNOW Politics) website, which promotes the participation of women in the political process.\n\nIn September 2012 Deveaux completed his assignment with the United Nations Development Programme and created Deveaux International Governance (DIG) Consultants Inc. , a firm focusing on the provision of technical advice to parliaments, political parties and organizations that work with these political institutions globally. \n\nSince the firm was created, Deveaux has worked with the World Bank, International IDEA, UN Women, UNDP, the European Union, USAID, the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation and other organizations.

{"id": "2067364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067364", "title": "Age of Conan", "text": "Age of Conan\n\nAge of Conan: Unchained (formerly known as Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures) is a fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Funcom and published by Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows in 2008. \"Age of Conan\" is the first installment in the planned \"Age of Conan\" series. \"Age of Conan\" takes place within the continent of the Hyborian kingdoms, a year after the events depicted in Robert E. Howard's Conan novel, \"The Hour of the Dragon\". \"Hyborian Adventures\"' release celebrated the 76th anniversary of the \"Conan\" franchise.\n\nCombat comprises striking a target from different angles, such as hacking down against the head, slashing diagonally down from the left or right, and slashing diagonally up from the left or right. These directions are designed to be strung together in combination naturally during combat. Difficult-to-perform combinations cause additional damage and faster strikes.\n\nThe developer Funcom stated that their \"Real Combat\" system, a combat system designed to offer more real-time options than traditional \"Dungeons & Dragons\"-inspired \"turn-based\" combat systems that are more commonly used, will be a prime attraction of \"Age of Conan: Unchained\". This \"Real Combat\" system is a first-person melee approach in which every enemy has three different areas that players can target. Combinations can be performed by stringing together consecutive attacks in particular directions. Feedback from players has pointed out that this system requires a certain degree of dexterity. Character statistics and item bonuses also play a role in this system, however item bonuses have less effect on a character's power than in comparable games, so that whilst equipment does play a certain role other factors also have an impact, such as the player's skill or their analysis of the scenario. The idea of \"Real Combat\" is to eliminate the dullness of typical MMO fighting, which often consists of an auto-attack feature.\n\nThe \"Real Combat\" system is used in one-on-one weapon battles, as well as during spell-casting, ranged combat and mounted combat. In some situations however, players will choose to band together and unite their skills to face other bands of players or non-player armies. Players can then work together and build on each other's strengths, for example a character standing in line with a 'Conqueror' when he is running will have a greater resistance to knockback effects.\n\nPlayers are able to take part in large scale siege operations. Adventurers can cooperate with one another to build cities with walls, towers and catapults that can protect player-owned taverns and merchant facilities.\n\nIn July 2011, a Hardcore PvP server was launched for the EU and US servers. This hardcore PvP server removes the guards from the various cities and playfields and re-opened PvP on the instances around the city of Tortage. This hardcore server brings back the basics of MMO PvP combat in that players will have a chance at dropping loot from their inventory when they are killed in player vs player combat. Players are also only able to have one character on these servers. This was a fresh-start server which doesn't allow any character transfer to it, does not allow the use of offline levels, or free level 50 characters.\n\nCharacters in \"Age of Conan\" are registered to a unique user account on a specific online server, with characters created on one server unable to be played on another. Players are able to create characters which function as their virtual avatars in the online world of Hyboria. During character creation, the player may choose from four playable races. The character is one of four archetypes (in bold) and one of three class selections for each archetype. The \"\" expansion brought on a new race, the \"Khitan\". Earlier only some classes were free to play but on December 13, 2012 all classes were made available in the free model.\n\n\"Age of Conan\" is set in a low fantasy pseudo-historical ancient world called the Hyborian Age, created by Robert E. Howard. The warlord Conan has seized the throne of Aquilonia, but ancient evils seek to overthrow him.\n\nThe lead artist Terje Lundberg said that the look and feel of \"Hyboria\" was based on the interpretation of the stories written by Howard:\n\nLundberg said the game at launch will contain three countries, Cimmeria, a northern country with snow and highlands, Aquilonia, which contains \"green hills, lush riverbeds, and the marvelous city of Tarantia\", and Stygia, which consists mostly of deserts and \"some beautiful cities\" — as well as the island of Tortage which \"has a diverse geography ranging from jungle to harbors\".\n\nBetween March 2005 and January 2006, Funcom periodically revealed concept art and screenshots from \"Age of Conan\". The art drector for the \"Conan\" project have been Didrik Tollefsen, previously known for \"The Longest Journey\" and \"Anarchy Online – Shadowlands\", which won the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction award in 2003.\n\nIn January 2006, Funcom unveiled the community portal for \"Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures\". By this time, much of the pre-launch community had gathered around the forums and IRC chat of the official \"Age of Conan\" website. There were informal events such as IRC chats with the developers and, in summer 2006, community contests. In April 2006, Funcom created a forum for guild recruitment entitled the Guild Hall for its pre-launch community, allowing forum members began organizing their player guilds.\n\nIn January 2007, several important updates were announced regarding the expected launch window for the game. Funcom also announced the original twenty-three classes had been merged down to fourteen classes to avoid the lack of diversity between them.\nThe game makes use of following technologies:\n\nOn February 7, 2008, Funcom and Eidos announced that over 500,000 people had signed up for the Beta Testing of \"Age of Conan\".\n\nFive principal individuals worked on the music and audio for \"Age of Conan\". The audio director was Morten Sørlie, who created the soundtrack for \"Anarchy Online – Shadowlands\". Simon Poole (lead sound designer on \"Dreamfall – The Longest Journey\") took over as audio director in May 2007, and saw the project through to completion. The sound designers are Tord D. Nikolaisen and Fredrik Martol. Composer Knut Avenstroup Haugen wrote the musical score for the game. To create a musical score for the Hyborian universe, Haugen turned to many different sources: For the music of the different ethnic groups, Haugen studied traditional music from relevant parts of the world. For the overall sound of the Hyborian Age, Haugen studied ancient and medieval music as well as the romantic orchestra repertoire and film scores, while avoiding conventions that connect too closely to specific historical periods.\n\nThe female vocalist heard in the score is Norwegian singer Helene Bøksle. The lyrics of the music is in the Old Norwegian language and comes from the Völuspá, the first and best known poem of the Poetic Edda. Norwegian punk rock artists Turbonegro contributed three bonus songs to the soundtrack CD, one of which was written specifically for the album.\n\nOver 40 actors voiced the large cast of characters. The recording was done at Side UK in London, Side LA in California, and at Funcom in Norway. The dance moves were made using motion capture on the dancer Hallgrim Hansegård, who is a backing dancer for the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009: \"Fairytale\" by Alexander Rybak.\n\nFuncom delayed \"Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures\" on January 21, 2008 and again on March 24, 2008. The delays were widely reported by online game magazines such as IGN. Once released, the game sold over 500,000 copies worldwide by June 1, 2008. Six days later one million copies had been shipped in total.\n\nSince release, Funcom has made improvements to performance and changes and additions to the game which were not ready in time for launch, as well as in response to feedback from players. Additions have included new adventuring zones, and revamps of existing dungeons.\n\nOn May 19, 2008, GameZone.com presented a series of original fictional stories by Michael Lafferty, stemming from the massively multiplayer online world of \"Age of Conan – Hyborian Adventures\". The stories were written with the permission and cooperation of Funcom. The tales explore the world, the characters and the lore involved in \"Hyboria\".\n\nIn September 2008, Gaute Godager, the producer and game director resigned from his role in \"Age of Conan\" and from Funcom, a company he had been involved in for over 16 years. In his press release, he revealed that he was not happy with elements in the game's development since release. He was succeeded by Craig Morrison, previously game director of \"Anarchy Online\", and community manager for various Funcom community forums.\n\nOn June 30, 2011, Funcom began marketing the game with the new title, \"Age of Conan: Unchained\" (as opposed to \"Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures\"), and altered the subscription model to a hybrid one. A hybrid model incorporates free-to-play (no monthly fee is charged) and premium plans. Premium players may choose from 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month recurring payment, while free-to-play players have limited access to characters, features, and areas. Some of the limitations can be removed with the use of the new \"Item Shop\" (available only in the game), where items can be bought with the help of Funcom Points. Funcom Points can be earned either by subscribing or by buying them with real cash.\n\nOn February 22, 2013, \"Age of Conan\" was released on Steam.\n\nIn his monthly letter for August 2013, Joel Byos revealed a new major PvP event titled \"The Great Hyborian Race\". A new server called the Blood and Glory ruleset server which will be started specifically for this event. The players will have to create a new character on this server in order to participate in this event. The objective is to reach level 80 in all classes by joining a guild or by going it alone. Those first to reach the level will be awarded special prizes. Those who reach a certain threshold of PvP experience within a given timeframe will be given bonus rewards. For the duration of the event, participants will be unable to use offline levels and restrictions will be placed on XP potions. Players have to earn experience through PvE and PvP fights. The developers are aiming to start the event after the server merge which was delayed due to office move by Funcom.\n\nThe first expansion titled \"Age of Conan: Rise of the Godslayer\" was released on May 11, 2010 and can be bought for Funcom Points from the item shop by all players. It provides new areas for medium-level characters in the form of a home zone for the new playable race, the Khitans; and four additional regions for high-level characters. The new content also includes new companions that can be trained for use as combat pets, or as mounts. A faction system was introduced in order to add variety and re-playability to the new zones. Through new quests, group instances, and raids, players are able to gather tokens to buy new armour sets. An additional incentive is the \"Alternative Advancement\" system; a new tree of character feats or perks that are acquired by means of a dedicated point system. It also expanded the raiding in the game to add Tier 4.\n\nOn August 31, 2011, Funcom released \"The Savage Coast of Turan\" adventure pack, which can be bought for Funcom Points from the item shop by all players. The pack includes a new playfield known as \"Coast of Ardashir\", two new solo instances, a group instance, a new 24-man raid instance called \"Temple of Erlik\" and a new combat pet. The new content was aimed to launch along with the 2011 film \"Conan the Barbarian\", so that players had the chance to see some of the characters, armor, and weapons from the film.\n\nOn September 3, 2012 Funcom announced that it is planning a new adventure pack called \"Secrets of Dragon's Spine\" which will be released in a series of updates. The pack introduces a new zone called Dragon's Spine, a row of small peaks in the southern wastes of Stygia. It will feature new quests, dungeons, challenges, a new mount type, a new raid instance and a new PvP area. The first update was released on live servers on January 10, 2013. On August 13, 2013 a new dungeon which also contains a city of the Serpent Men was added in the Dragon's Spine. A Serpent Man boss called Oldblood along with a new area was added on 6 March 2014.\n\nThe perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, used music from the \"Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures\" soundtrack in a video he uploaded to video sharing sites, including YouTube, at the same time that he published his manifesto. Breivik wrote that Bøksle's voice is the perfect sound to listen to when one commits acts of martyrdom. During his trial he also testified that he uses this music, particularly the song \"Ere the World Crumbles\" when he meditates, as he did in preparation for his terrorist acts on 22 July 2011. Bøksle said in a press release in the week following the attacks that she distanced herself from Breivik's use of the music. The music's composer, Knut Avenstroup Haugen, has done the same.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to Metacritic. Seth Schiesel, writing for \"The New York Times\", opined that the development of the game would have benefited from a few extra months of production.\n\nKnut Avenstroup Haugen won the IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media for his score.\n\n\n"}

It is widely cultivated as an easily grown bedding plant, with thousands of different cultivars in brilliant shades of yellow and orange.\n\nSome authorities regard \"Tagetes patula\" as a synonym of \"Tagetes erecta\".\n\nThe Latin specific epithet \"patula\" means “with a spreading habit”. \n\nThe flower is an annual, occasionally reaching tall by wide. In some climates it flowers from July to October. In its native habitat of the highlands of central Mexico, blooms are produced from September to killing frost. Achenes ripen and are shed within two weeks of the start of bloom. The heads contain mostly hermaphrodite (having both male and female organs) florets and are pollinated primarily by beetles in the wild, as well as by tachinid flies and other insects. The leaves of all species of marigold include oil glands. The oils are pungent. It can grow in both sandy and clay soils provided they have good drainage. It requires growing in sunlight. Resists cold well to -1°C ; from there it is sensitive to frost and does not develop in the shade.\n\nThis plant is valued for its velvet-textured, brightly coloured blooms in shades of yellow, orange and brown in summer. It is shorter, and has a more spreading habit, than its relative the African marigold (\"Tagetes erecta\"). It is therefore more suitable as an edging plant in the open border.\n\nThe plant is used in companion planting for many vegetable crops. Its root secretions are believed to kill nematodes in the soil and it is said to repel harmful insects, such as white flies on tomatoes.\n\nHundreds of cultivars have been developed, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- \n\nMedicinally, many cultures use infusions from dried leaves or florets. Research also suggests that T. patula essential oil has the ability to be used as residual pesticide against bedbugs.\n\nThe essential oil is being investigated for antifungal activity, including treatment of candidiasis and treating fungal infections in plants.\n\nThe dried and ground flower petals constitute a popular spice in the Republic of Georgia in the Caucasus, where they are known as imeruli shaphrani (= 'Imeretian Saffron') from their pungency and golden colour and particular popularity in the Western province of Imereti. The spice imparts a unique, rather earthy flavour to Georgian cuisine, in which it is considered especially compatible with the flavours of cinnamon and cloves. It is also a well-nigh essential ingredient in the spice mixture khmeli suneli, which is to Georgian cookery what garam masala is to the cookery of North India - with which Georgia shares elements of the Mughlai cuisine.\n\n\"Tagetes patula\" florets are grown and harvested annually to add to poultry feed to help give the yolks a golden color. \nThe florets can also be used to color human foods. A golden yellow dye is used to color animal-based textiles (wool, silk) without a mordant, but a mordant is needed for cotton and synthetic textiles.\n\nThe whole plant is harvested when in flower and distilled for its essential oil. The oil is used in perfumery. It is blended with sandalwood oil to produce 'attar genda' perfume. About of oil can be extracted from of the plant yielding of flowers and of herbage.\n"}

Sometimes called the rose of winter, it belongs to the family Theaceae. It is the official state flower of Alabama. There are thousands of cultivars of \"C. japonica\" in cultivation, with many different colors and forms of flowers. In the U.S. it is sometimes called japonica, a name more often used in the UK for \"Chaenomeles\" (flowering quince).\n\nIn the wild, it is found in mainland China (Shandong, east Zhejiang), Taiwan, southern Korea and southern Japan. It grows in forests, at altitudes of around .\n\n\"Camellia japonica\" is a flowering tree or shrub, usually tall, but occasionally up to tall. Some cultivated varieties achieve a size of 72 m or more. The youngest branches are purplish brown, becoming grayish brown as they age. The alternately arranged leathery leaves are dark green on the top side, paler on the underside, usually long by wide with a stalk (petiole) about long. The base of the leaf is pointed (cuneate), the margins are very finely toothed (serrulate) and the tip somewhat pointed.\n\nIn the wild, flowering is between January and March. The flowers appear along the branches, particularly towards the ends, and have very short stems. They occur either alone or in pairs, and are across. There are about nine greenish bracteoles and sepals. Flowers of the wild species have six or seven rose or white petals, each long by wide; the innermost petals are joined at the base for up to a third of their length. (Cultivated forms often have more petals.) The numerous stamens are long, the outer whorl being joined at the base for up to . The three-lobed style is about long.\n\nThe fruit consists of a globe-shaped capsule with three compartments (locules), each with one or two large brown seeds with a diameter of . Fruiting occurs in September to October in the wild.\n\n\"C. japonica\" leaves are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the engrailed (\"Ectropis crepuscularia\"). The Japanese white eye bird (\"Zosterops japonica\") pollinates \"Camellia japonica\".\n\nThe genus \"Camellia\" was named after a Jesuit priest and botanist named Georg Kamel. The specific epithet \"japonica\" was given to the species by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 because Engelbert Kaempfer was the first to give a description of the plant while in Japan.\n\nTwo varieties are distinguished in the \"Flora of China\": \"C. japonica\" var. \"japonica\" and \"C. japonica\" var. \"rusticana\"\n\n\"C. japonica\" var. \"japonica\" is the form named by Linnaeus, and naturally occurs in forests at altitudes of in Shandong, eastern Zhejiang in mainland China and in Taiwan, south Japan, and South Korea. The leaf has a glabrous stem (petiole) about long. The bracteoles and sepals are velutinous (velvety). It flowers between January and March, and fruits in between September and October. It is grown as a garden plant in the form of many cultivars throughout the world.\n\n\"Camellia japonica\" var. \"rusticana\" naturally occurs in forests in Zhejiang (island of Zhoushan Qundao) in mainland China and in Honshu, Japan. The leaf has a shorter petiole, about long, with fine hairs (pubescent) at the base. The bracteoles and sepals are smooth (glabrous) on the outside. The color of the flowers ranges from red through rose to pink, flowering in April to May. This variety is regarded by some botanical authorities to be a separate species: \"Camellia rusticana\".\n\nIn Japan it is known by the common name \"yuki-tsubaki\" (snow camellia) as it naturally occurs in areas of heavy snowfall at altitudes ranging from down to on sloping land under deciduous beech trees in the mountain regions to the north of the main island of Honshu and facing the Sea of Japan. In December heavy drifts of snow come in from the north, covering the plants to a depth of up to . The bushes remain covered by snow from December till the end of March when the snow melts in early Spring and the camellias start flowering.\n\nCultivars of \"C. japonica\" var. \"rusticana\" include: 'Nishiki-kirin', 'Nishiki-no-mine', 'Toyo-no-hikari' and 'Otome'.\n\n\"Camellia japonica\" has appeared in paintings and porcelain in China since the 11th century. Early paintings of the plant are usually of the single red flowering type. However, a single white flowering plant is shown in the scroll of the \"Four Magpies\" of the Song Dynasty.\nThe first records of camellias in Australia pertain to a consignment to Alexander Macleay of Sydney that arrived in 1826 and were planted in Sydney at Elizabeth Bay House.\n\nIn 1838 six \"C. japonica\" plants were imported by the botanist, horticulturist and agriculturist William Macarthur. During the years that followed he brought in several hundred varieties and grew them at Camden Park Estate. For many years Macarthur's nursery was one of the main sources of supply to the colony in Australia of ornamental plants, as well as fruit trees and vines.\n\nIn 1845, William Macarthur wrote to the London nurseryman Conrad Loddiges, acknowledging receipt of camellias and mentioning: \"I have raised four or five hundred seedlings of camellia, chiefly from seeds produced by 'Anemoniflora'. As this variety never has anthers of its own, I fertilised its blossoms with pollen of \"C. reticulata\" and Sp. \"maliflora\".\" Although most of Macarthur's seedling varieties have been lost to cultivation, some are still popular today, including 'Aspasia Macarthur' (named after him).\n\nA well-known camellia nursery in Sydney was \"Camellia Grove\", set up in 1852 by Silas Sheather who leased land adjoining the Parramatta River on what was originally part of Elizabeth Farm. \"Fuller's Sydney Handbook\" of 1877 describes his nursery as having 59 varieties of camellias. Camellia and other flowers from Sheather's nursery were sent by steamship downriver to florists at Sydney Markets, tied in bunches and suspended from long pieces of wood which were hung up about the decks. Silas Sheather developed a number of camellia cultivars, the most popular (and still commercially grown) were \"C. japonica\" 'Prince Frederick William' and \"C. japonica\" 'Harriet Beecher Sheather', named after his daughter. The area in the vicinity of Sheather's nursery was eventually made a suburb and named Camellia, in honor of Camellia Grove nursery.\n\nBy 1883, Shepherd and Company, the leading nurserymen in Australia at the time, listed 160 varieties of \"Camellia japonica\".\n\nAssociate Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse was a scholar, linguist, garden designer and camellia expert who brought about a worldwide revival of interest in the genus in the first half of the twentieth century. The E.G. Waterhouse National Camellia Garden in Sydney, Australia is named after him.\n\nAccording to a research conducted in 1959, by Dr. Frederick Meyer, of the United States Department of Agriculture, the camellias of Campo Bello (Portugal) are the oldest known specimens in Europe, which would have been planted around 1550, that is to say, these trees are nowadays approximately 460 years old. However it is said that the camellia was first brought to the West in 1692 by Engelbert Kaempfer, Chief Surgeon to the Dutch East India Company. He brought details of over 30 varieties back from Asia. Camellias were introduced into Europe during the 18th century and had already been cultivated in the Orient for thousands of years. Robert James of Essex, England, is thought to have brought back the first live camellia to England in 1739. On his return from Dejima, Carl Peter Thunberg made a short trip to London where he made the acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks. Thunberg donated to Kew Botanic Gardens four specimens of \"Camellia japonica\". One of these was supposedly given in 1780 to the botanical garden of Pillnitz Castle near Dresden in Germany where it currently measures in height and in diameter.\n\nThe oldest trees of \"Camellia japonica\" in Europe can be found in Campobello (Portugal), Caserta (Italy) and Pillnitz (Germany). These were probably planted at the end of the 16th century.\n\nIn the U.S., camellias were first sold in 1807 as greenhouse plants, but were soon distributed to be grown outdoors in the south.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the estate garden of Magnolia-on-the-Ashley introduced hundreds of new \"Camellia japonica\" cultivars from the 19th century onwards, and its recently restored collection has been designated an International Camellia Garden of Excellence. \"Debutante\", a popular variety, was originally introduced by Magnolia as \"Sarah C. Hastie\". The name was changed to give it more marketing appeal.\n\nCross-breeding of camellias has produced many cultivars which are tolerant of hardiness zone 6 winters. These camellia varieties can grow in the milder parts of the lower Midwest (St. Louis, for example), Pacific Northwest, NYC area (NYC/NJ/CT), and even Ontario, Canada (near edge of the Great Lakes).\n\n\"Camellia japonica\" is valued for its flowers, which can be single, semi-double or double flowered. There are more than 2,000 cultivars developed from \"C. japonica\". The shade of the flowers can vary from red to pink to white; they sometimes have multi-coloured stripes or specks. Cultivars include 'Elegans' with large pink flowers which often have white streaks, 'Giulio Nuccio' with red to pinkish petals and yellow stamens, 'Mathotiana Alba' with pure white flowers, and the light crimson semi-double-flowered 'The Czar'.\n\n\"C. japonica\" 'Alba Plena' is nicknamed the \"Bourbon Camellia\". Captain Connor of the East Indiaman , brought the flower to England in 1792. The flowers are pure white and about 3 to 4 inches across. It blooms earlier than most cultivated camellias, in the early winter or spring, and can flower for 4 to 5 months.\n\nThe zig-zag camellia or \"C. japonica\" 'Unryu' has different zig-zag branching patterns. \"Unryu\" means \"dragon in the clouds\" in Japanese; the Japanese believe it looks like a dragon climbing up to the sky. Another type of rare camellia is called the fishtail camellia or \"C. japonica\" 'Kingyo-tsubaki'. The tips of the leaves of this plant resemble a fish's tail.\n\nThe following is a selection of cultivars that have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\nFor a full list of AGM camellia cultivars, see List of Award of Garden Merit camellias\nCamellia flower forms are quite varied but the main types are single, semi-double, formal double, informal double and elegans (or anemone) form.\n\nSingle flowers have five to a maximum of eight petals in one row, petals loose, regular or irregular. May include petaloids; prominent display of stamens & pistils.\n\nTwo or more rows of large regular, irregular or loose outer petals (nine or more) with an uninterrupted cluster of stamens. May include petaloids; petals may overlap or be set in rows for 'hose in hose' effect.\n\nA semi-double with one or more petaloids interrupting the cluster of stamens.\n\nMany rows and number of petals (sometimes more than a hundred), regularly disposed, tiered or imbricated, but no visible stamens. Usually with a central cone of tightly furled petals.\n\nOne or more rows of large outer petals lying flat or undulating, with a mass of intermingled petaloids and stamens in the center. Also called \"Anemone Form\".\n\nA mass of raised petals with petaloids (parts of the flower that have assumed the appearance of small, narrow or twisted petals). Stamens may or may not be visible. Also called \"Peony Form\".\nCamellias should be planted in the shade in organic, somewhat acidic, semi-moist but well drained soil. If the soil is not well drained, it can cause the roots to rot.\n\nAs a \"Camellia\" species, \"C. japonica\" can be used to make tea. Its processed leaves show aromatic fragrance. It contains caffeine and catechins of the same kind as \"C. sinensis\".\n\nSome fungal and algal diseases include: Spot Disease, which gives the upper side of leaves a silver color and round spots, and can cause loss of leaves; Black Mold; Leaf Spot; Leaf Gall; Flower Blight, which causes flowers to become brown and fall; Root Rot; and Canker caused by the fungus \"Glomerella cingulata\", which penetrates plants through wounds.\nSome insects and pests of \"C. japonica\" are the Fuller Rose Beetle \"Pantomorus cervinus\", the mealybugs \"Planococcus citri\" and \"Pseudococcus longispinus\", the weevils \"Otiorhyncus salcatus\" and \"Otiorhyncus ovatus\", and the tea scale \"Fiorinia theae\".\n\nSome physiological diseases include salt injury which results from high levels of salt in soil; chlorosis which is thought to be caused lack of certain elements in the soil or insufficient acidity preventing their absorption by the roots; bud drop which causes loss or decay of buds, and can be caused by over-watering, high temperatures, or pot-bound roots. Other diseases are oedema and sunburn. Not much is known about viral diseases in \"C. japonica\".\n\nCamellias are seen as lucky symbols for the Chinese New Year and spring and were even used as offerings to the gods during the Chinese New Year. It is also thought that Chinese women would never wear a Camellia in their hair because it opened much later after the bud formed. This was thought to signify that she would not have a son for a long time.\n\nOne of the most important plants related to \"Camellia japonica\" is the \"Camellia sinensis\", which is the plant tea comes from. This plant is not usually grown in gardens because it has small white flowers, unlike the \"Camellia japonica\", which has larger, more beautiful flowers. It is not seen in art as often as the \"Camellia japonica\", but it is shown in a painting called the \"Song Hundred Flowers\" which hangs in the Palace Museum in Beijing. \"Camellia sinensis\" may have been used as medicine during the Shang Dynasty. It was first used for drinking during the Zhou Dynasty.\n\nThe following is a poem written by English evangelical Protestant writer Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna in 1834:\n\n<poem>\nTHE WHITE CAMELLIA JAPONICA.\nThou beauteous child of purity and grace,\nDefilement bore me — my abiding place\nBut light looked on me from a holier sphere,\nAnd can I vainly to thine eye appear,\nFrom thy dark dwelling look thou forth, and see\n</poem>\n\n\n"}

He has won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes three times each, and the Belmont Stakes once. Aboard Real Quiet, he lost the 1998 Triple Crown by a nose.\n\nFrom a Cajun family, Desormeaux grew up in a rural farming area located a few miles outside Maurice, Louisiana. His parents are Brenda and Harris Desormeaux. \"I was born and raised here\", his mother said. \"We speak French and are proud of it. My dad is the one who bought Kent his first saddle. There's always been a strong connection to this countryside.\" His brother, Keith, older by three years, is a race horse trainer. They have four younger siblings, Kristie, Kelli, Kalen and Kip. His mother explained the names: \"Keith was named for my little brother John Keith, who drowned. I just liked the name Kent and then we just decided to go with the K's.\" Desormeaux was a member of the local 4-H club, and was first exposed to race-riding at age 12. Keith Desormeaux explained that, \"The bush tracks were all around us, and our dad decided he might want to delve into horse racing and bought a bush track [Acadiana Downs] ... We lived in an agricultural area but we weren't farmers. Even before we got into racing, we all had horses to ride growing up.\"\n\nAccording to Kent's mother, \"He was a tremendous student, top of his class. I thought he would be a doctor or lawyer, and one day he comes home and says he wants to be a jockey, and I said: 'I don't think so.'\" He left school at age 16, though would later pass his high school equivalency (GED) test.\nDesormeaux has two sons, Joshua and Jacob, from a previous marriage. He met his first wife, Sonia, in high school and they married in 1989. They separated in 2008 and divorced in 2012. The younger of the two boys, Jacob, has Usher Syndrome and the family has worked to promote research on the disease and support others who face the condition. On January 7, 2013, Desormeaux married his current wife, Rosie Higgins.\n\nDesormeaux was sixteen years old when he began working as an apprentice jockey at the Evangeline Downs racetrack in Lafayette, Louisiana. On July 13, 1986, he rode Miss Tavern to his first career victory. He won his first career stakes race on December 13 of that year, riding Godbey in the Maryland City Handicap at Laurel Park Racecourse. For 1986, he had 55 wins from 525 starts.\n\nHis success led him to move north to compete on the Maryland racing circuit, where his winning record earned him the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey in 1987. While racing in Maryland from 1987-89, Desormeaux won more races than any other jockey in North America. He is one of only four jockeys to have won three national titles in a row. In 1987, he had 450 wins from 2,207 starts with earnings of $5.1 million. In 1988, he improved to 474 wins from 1,897 starts and earnings of $6.3 million. He got his first mount in the Kentucky Derby in 1988, finishing 16th.\n\nIn 1989 Desormeaux won his third jockey title, and set an American record for most wins in a year with 598; the previous record had been 546. The record still stands. That year, Desormeaux competed in 2,312 races, earning $9.1 million. He also won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey. Desormeaux, became the third jockey to win the Eclipse Award in both the apprentice and overall categories, Chris McCarron and Steve Cauthen being the others.\n\nIn 1990, he moved to the highly competitive southern California circuit. He later explained, \"If I wanted to be in the Kentucky Derby or Breeders' Cup, I had to make a change.\" Desormeaux would soon win his first major stakes race, the San Juan Capistrano Invitational, then a Grade 1 race at Santa Anita with a purse of $500,000. Competition for mounts was fierce. \n\nAs a result of the move, Desormeaux's number of wins declined to 220 in 1990, a 60% decrease from 1989. His earnings were less affected, totaling $7.1 million in 1990, a 22% decrease from the year before, a result of the higher purses generally available in California. In 1992, Desormeaux would become the regular rider of Best Pal, who put together a string of four graded stakes wins, including the Santa Anita Handicap. He would later call Best Pal his favorite horse to ride. \"Best Pal may not have been the fastest horse I ever rode...but what that horse was, was push button.\"\n\nOn December 11, 1992, at Hollywood Park, Desormeaux was thrown when the horse he was riding, Judge Hammer, shied during the stretch drive. He was then kicked in the head by a trailing horse, resulting in multiple skull fractures and a permanent hearing deficit. Prior to the fall, Desormeaux had been on pace to break José A. Santos' then-current earnings record of $14.8 million. Desormeaux fell just short with earnings of $14.1 million, but still won the national earnings title. He also received his second Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey.\n\nDespite the severity of his injuries, Desormeaux was back riding in six weeks and soon rebounded to his old form. \"I think he answered all the questions with [his comeback] rides\" said fellow jockey Gary Stevens. \"You've got to prove yourself all over again to your clients.\"\" On January 23, Desormeaux would pick up the mount on Kotashaan. They proceeded to win five grade 1 races together, culminating in the 1993 Breeders' Cup Turf. At the end of the year his peers voted him the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award.\n\nOne of Desormeaux's more infamous moments though came when riding Kotashaan in the Japan Cup of 1993. They were about to overtake the leader in the closing stages when Desormeaux sat up on the horse, having misjudged the finish line. Kotashaan's trainer, Richard Mandella said: \"He didn't stand up for a second and sit down again, he half pulled up.\" Kotashaan finished second; the mistake costing roughly $1 million in prize money.\n\nIn 1995, Desormeaux, aged 25, became the youngest rider to amass 3,000 victories. That year, he scored his second Breeders' Cup title when he beat the \"boys\" in the Breeders' Cup Sprint with the filly Desert Stormer. In 1997, at age 27, he was the youngest jockey to surpass $100 million in career earnings.\n\nDuring the mid-nineties, Desormeaux gradually gained a reputation of not listening to trainers. \"There is no doubt that I was on top of the world\", Desormeaux said. \"No one needed to tell me how to ride a horse. I became very irresponsible with rides. I was immature in a number of situations. I wasn't professional. I didn't pay attention to trainer's instructions, and I wasn't persevering to the wire.\" He never stopped competing, but his win percentage dropped from 23% in 1992 (364 wins in 1,594 starts) to 17% in 1996 (182 wins in 1,053 starts).\n\nAlthough he had a great deal of success early in his career, it wasn't until 1998 that he made an impact on the Triple Crown trail. That year, Desormeaux rode Real Quiet to victory in the 1998 Kentucky Derby. \"My whole life and career flashed through my mind,\" he said. \"To win the Kentucky Derby -- after having been on top of the world and then falling off the face of the Earth—it was like I was wide-awake inside my most fantastic dream.\"\n\nHe followed this with a victory in the Preakness Stakes. However, Desormeaux lost his bid to win the Triple Crown when Victory Gallop beat Real Quiet by a nose in the final stride in the Belmont Stakes. \"It hurts that I'll live in infamy. Who wants to be known for the closest ever to almost win the Triple Crown?\" Later that year, he went on to ride the Canadian 3-year-old champion colt Archers Bay to victory in the Queen's Plate, becoming the first jockey since Bill Hartack in 1964 to complete the Kentucky Derby/Queen's Plate double in the same year.\n\nIn 2000, Desormeaux won his second Kentucky Derby aboard Fusaichi Pegasus. The two combined to take the Wood Memorial Stakes and Jerome Handicap. \"Probably the most talented horse I rode (was) Fusaichi Pegasus,\" he said in 2004. \"What an amazing, amazing, animal that horse was.\" In 2001, Desormeaux decided to ride in Japan for three months. His son, Joshua, then age 2, had been born deaf and had recently received a \"microphonic implant.\" Since Japan only has two racing days a week (compared to six in the United States), the move allowed Desormeaux to spend more time with his family. During this stint, he became the first foreign jockey to win a Classic race in Japan when he rode Lady Pastel to victory in the Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks).\n\nIn 2002, Desormeaux had a good year, ranked tenth by total earnings, capped by his second win in the Santa Anita Handicap on Milwaukee Brew. His ranking then dropped to 31st in 2003. In 2004, he won only 104 races, though his earnings were boosted by his first victory in the Arlington Million. He changed his agent, then shuttled between Japan and America in 2005 for several months. \n\nBy the end of 2005, he'd accumulated 75 North American wins plus 38 wins in Japan. Although he had no grade 1 wins that year, he did guide Zenno Rob Roy to third place in both the Takarazuka Kinen and Japan Cup. On his return, he again changed agents and in 2006 \"moved tack\" to the east coast.\n\nIn 2008, Desormeaux won his third Kentucky Derby aboard Big Brown who won easily by just under five lengths. Two weeks later, Desormeaux rode Big Brown to victory in the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course, this time winning by just over five lengths while in hand. With a Triple Crown on the line, Big Brown was made the heavy 3-10 favorite in the Belmont Stakes. Unfortunately, Big Brown broke poorly and was rank for the first quarter mile. He finally settled, but had no response when Desormeaux asked him to run. Desormeaux eased Big Brown after the colt tired at the quarter pole. It was an inexplicably poor performance by a colt who went on to win the Haskell Invitational and Monmouth Park Stakes. Desormeaux received a good deal of criticism for his ride, though some praised him for protecting the colt from potential injury.\n\nHe scored his 5,000th career victory on July 27, 2008 by guiding Bella Attrice to victory in the 7th race at Saratoga Race Course. In 2009, Desormeaux won the Belmont Stakes for the first time when he rode Summer Bird to victory, followed by wins in the Travers Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup. Desormeaux commented after the latter win, \"He's trying to be the best horse I've ever ridden. He was awesome today.\" The wins would earn the colt the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Colt.\n\nIn 2010, Desormeaux teamed up with the filly Unrivaled Belle to score an upset win over Rachel Alexandra in the La Troienne Stakes. Later that year, Unrivaled Belle gave Desormeaux his fifth Breeders' Cup win when she upset Blind Luck in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. As he entered his forties, his family became concerned that his demanding career was beginning to take a toll on Desormeaux's health. At 5'3\", Desormeaux has said his natural weight would be about 135 pounds, and that he has occasionally had trouble keeping at a riding weight of around 115 pounds. \"All jockeys think about food all the time,\" he stated once. And his fall in 1992 left him with a permanent hearing deficit in one ear.\n\nBut above all, he had a long struggle with alcohol use, for which the racing industry maintains a low raceday tolerance due to the high risk of the sport. Desormeaux failed breathalyzer tests in 2010 at Woodbine, and in 2012 at Belmont Park, the latter costing him mounts in the Preakness and Belmont that year. The alcohol issues led many trainers to shy away from using him. \"It was a tough decision on the personal level because we're friends. But it wasn't a tough decision on the business level\", explained trainer Dale Romans. \"When the good Kent shows up, he is the best rider in the country and one of the best of all time. That's what the shame of it is.\"\n\nOn August 31, 2011, Desormeaux was arrested when he tapped a NYRA security guard with his car at Saratoga Race Course. Charged with second degree reckless endangerment, he later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct. His opportunities continued to dry up, causing his rank by North American earnings to drop from 15th in 2010 to 99th in 2013. In 2014, he failed to crack the top 100 for the first time in his career.\nIn the summer of 2014, Keith Desormeaux helped bring Kent back into the limelight by offering the ride on a promising colt named Texas Red. Although Texas Red was third behind American Pharoah when the two met in the FrontRunner Stakes, Texas Red would win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile when American Pharoah was withdrawn due to injury. It was Keith's first Breeders' Cup win and Kent's fifth, and the first time brothers had combined to win a Breeders' Cup race. Unfortunately, Texas Red missed most of the 2015 racing season due to injury. When he finally did get his second chance at American Pharoah in the Travers Stakes, they both lost to Keen Ice, a colt that had previously been Desormeaux's mount.\n\nThe brothers next teamed up with another colt, Exaggerator. After an encouraging two-year-old campaign in 2015, Desormeaux rode the colt to an impressive come-from-behind victory in the 2016 Santa Anita Derby that made the colt the second betting choice for the 2016 Kentucky Derby. The Desormeaux brothers finished second at the Derby, but would celebrate victory together on May 21 when Exaggerator won the 2016 Preakness Stakes. Desormeaux credited his early years riding the Maryland circuit with giving him a crucial edge at Pimlico: \"With these turns you want to paint the fence. We did, they didn't and—not for nothing—knowledge is power.\"\n\nFollowing a drinking binge the night of his Preakness win, Desormeaux decided to address his alcohol issues. He said, \"I hit bottom… I had a blackout. That's enough.\" With the encouragement of his wife and brother, on May 31, 2016, he checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation program at Cirque Lodge in Sundance, Utah. After a stay of eight days, he flew to New York to prepare for the 2016 Belmont Stakes, accompanied by a coach who assisted him in maintaining sobriety. Exaggerator did not respond when asked to run in the homestretch and finished eleventh. Kent's brother, Keith, did not blame the jockey, but noted the horse had run all three legs of the Triple Crown series and had struggled with the Belmont track.\n\nDesormeaux reached a milestone only 18 others in North America have met on Jan. 27, 2019 at Santa Anita Park, when he rode X S Gold to victory to secure his 6,000th win. As of his 6000th win, he climbed to no. 16 on the all-time wins list and no. 6 in mount earnings. \n\nIn 2004, Kent Desormeaux was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\n\n\nKentucky Derby highlights:\n\nPreakness Stakes highlights:\n\nBelmont Stakes highlights:\n\nRanked by North American earnings\n\n"}

It involves the combative use of a slender stick from long, wielded in both hands, and characterised by fluid motion in attacks and defences.\n\nThough similar stick fighting techniques are present in the Iberian peninsula (e.g. Portuguese and Galician \"jogo do pau\"), the origins of \"juego del palo\" may be traced back to the Guanches, the indigenous people of the Canary Islands in pre-colonial times during the early 15th century. A Spanish engineer named Leonardo Torriani wrote a history of the Canary Islands in 1590 and included a record of early \"juego del palo\", accompanied by an illustration of two Guanche warriors performing a type of ritual combat with short staves in a small arena. Torriani wrote;\n\n\"When two Canarians went to duel, they met at a special place established for this purpose. It was a small enclosure with a level, raised stone platform at each end. To begin, they each stood upon a platform, armed with three of the smooth throwing stones they call \"tahuas\", and also with the stick called \"magodo\" or \"amodeghe\". Then they dodged the stones as they were thrown, skillfully twisting their bodies without moving their feet. Next, they stepped down and fenced with the staves, each one trying to gain advantage over the other, as is our custom also.\"\nThe art has been maintained through to the present day, undergoing a particular renaissance during the 1970s as part of a general effort to maintain native Canarian folk traditions. It bears resemblance to the Portuguese martial art \"jogo do pau\" and the Venezuelan form \"juego del garrote\".\n\n\"Juego del palo\" is now a popular sports activity in the Canaries and has been the subject of considerable academic interest as well, with a number of professional conferences having been held at local universities to investigate the history, culture, and technique of the art.\n\nThis may be described as a form of stick fencing between two players that is characterized by the spontaneous interplay of attacking techniques and defense techniques. No protective equipment is worn in traditional \"juego del palo\"; safety is maintained through the skilled control of attacks, which are restrained rather than being made with full force upon the opponent's body.\n\nJuego del palo is divided into a number of specific styles or local traditions that have been developed on particular islands within the archipelago, and/or by particular families. The nine primary styles practiced in modern \"juego del palo\" include (mostly named after founders of the styles): Deniz, Morales, Verga, Acosta, Quintero, Vidal, Confiero, \"juego del garrote\" ('game of the club') and \"juego de la lata\" ('game of the tin') . Each style is distinguished from the others by specific fighting techniques and strategies, and also by the rules under which it is played as a competitive game.\n\n\n"}

Namiki is mostly famous for its handmade \"maki-e\" (a Japanese lacquerware craft with a wide range of fine and decorative arts) designs on urushi-based lacquers.\n\n\"Namiki\" is the surname of Ryosuke Namiki, the founder of the Pilot Corporation, named \"Namiki Manufacturing Company\" until 1938 when it became \"Pilot Pen Co., Ltd.\". The brand name Namiki came to fame in the early 20th century when Dunhill retailed in the west the Maki-e pens produced by Pilot under the brand \"Dunhill-Namiki\". This partnership has continued to the present day (occasionally Namiki makes a Limited Edition for Dunhill) although Namiki has always been owned by Pilot.\n\nMost of the fountain pens had been made of ebonite, a material that combines sulfur and rubber. However, ebonite changed color and lost its shine as the years went by. Being aware of this, the Namiki Co. Ltd. (current \"Pilot Corporation\") started to try different methods and materials to overcome the problem. After some attempts, they discovered that lacquer coating could tolerate deterioration and make pens more durable. They also tried painting designs on fountain bodies, using the \"maki-e\" technique, The process would be later patented by Pilot.\n\nIn 1925 the Namiki brand was launched to market, with lacquer artists Shisui Rokkaku and Gonroku Matsuda invited to make fountain pens. Ryosuke Namiki and Masao Wada (founders of Pilot Co. in 1918) traveled to promote their \"make-e\" pens in Western countries. In 1926, a Pilot Office was opened in London, England, and four years later a contract was signed with the Alfred Dunhill Ltd. to commercialize Namiki pens in the main European cities and the United States under the brand \"Dunhill-Namiki Made in Japan\". The brand would later expand to New York, Shanghai and Singapore.\n\nNamiki fountain pens and non-disposable Pilot fountain pens share the Pilot/Namiki proprietary ink refill cartridge, with inks available in several colors. Converters of both the piston type and squeeze type are also available to allow Namiki and Pilot fountain pens to be filled from ink bottles.\n\nThe curve-sided Namiki ink bottle has an inner inkwell to keep the nib steady during filling and also to allow almost the last few drops of ink to be taken from the bottle into a pen.\n\nAs of November 2019, collections commercialized by Namiki include the \"Emperor\", the most renowned collection of the Namiki brand. All models have a base layer of Urushi with Maki-e art drawn on to the base layer. There are seven models in this collection, Gold Fish (金魚), Dragon (龍), Owl (梟), Kylin (麒麟), Carp on Waterfall (鯉の滝登り), and Treasure (宝).\n\nOther collections are Yukari, Yukari Royale, Chinkin, Nippon Art, Urushi and Limited Edition.\n\n\n"}

He also assisted at the Sunday School at Cross Street where he met William Fairbairn and William Gaskell. In 1868, he married Ellen Ferguson at the chapel and they went on to have three children.\n\nBy the 1870s, the Manchester Mechanics' Institute was in decline. Despite its original ambitious mission to bring technical expertise to working men, its core activities had shrunk to the provision of elementary education where it faced increasing competition from the state-funded schools established by the Elementary Education Act 1870. In 1879, Reynolds was appointed Secretary to the Institute and immediately set about its rejuvenation. An able and active administrator, and an enthusiastic and persuasive advocate, Reynolds grasped the city's appetite for more effective vocational education and planned and led the relaunch of the institution as the \"Manchester Technical School\" in 1882.\n\nReynolds still did not rest. He reorganised the school using the schemes and examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute and, following legislation in 1889 and 1890, negotiated the school's transfer to Manchester City Council as the \"Municipal Technical School\". Reynolds took a role in the city authority as director of technical instruction and set out to survey the superior establishments in Germany and Switzerland and the thriving schools of the United States and Canada.\n\nA grant from the Whitworth Institute enabled him to realise his ambitions for a state-of-the-art institution with the construction of the existing buildings on Sackville Street, opened in 1902 by Arthur Balfour. The institution was renamed as the \"Municipal School of Technology\" and Reynolds became its principal and director for higher education of Manchester.\n\nIn 1904, the newly-autonomous Victoria University of Manchester recognised the status of many of the courses that Reynolds had developed by establishing a faculty of technology at the Institute. Reynolds became dean of the faculty, enjoying an \"ex officio\" seat on the university's senate. The Institute's newly appointed professors were recognised by the university. However, consistent with Reynolds' radical sympathies, the bulk of the Institute's work was still devoted to vocational, rather than academic, education.\n\nReynolds lived most of his later life in Cheadle Hulme.

This followed the 'expulsions' of Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume from the First International at the Hague Congress (1872). It attracted some affiliates of the First International, repudiated the Hague resolutions, and adopted a Bakuninist programme, and lasted until 1877.\n\nThe St. Imier International was created when the Swiss Jura Federation, the most important anarchist section of the old International, sent a proposal to the other sections, several of which then assembled at St. Imier to create a new anti-authoritarian organization. The organization was made up of various national federations of workers' societies, mainly the Italian, Spanish, Belgian, American, French and French-speaking Swiss federations, together with other individual organizations which all opposed Karl Marx's control of the General Council and favoured the autonomy of national sections from centralized control.\n\nAt the St. Imier Congress, held on 15–16 September 1872, the delegates proclaimed \"[t]hat the aspirations of the proletariat can have no other aim than the creation of an absolutely free economic organisation and federation based upon work and equality and wholly independent of any political government, and that such an organisation or federation can only come into being through the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, through its trade societies, and through self-governing communes.\"\n\nThe St. Imier International lasted until 1877, while the First International dissolved in 1876. In July 1881, anarchists would initiate the International Working People's Association, or \"Black International\", which remained active until the late 1880s. A further attempt to create a lasting international organization was made in Amsterdam in 1907 by an International Anarchist Congress, though this would have an even briefer life than the Black International.\n\nContemporary anarchist internationals include the anarcho-syndicalist International Workers' Association (established 1922), the International of Anarchist Federations (est. 1968), and Black Bridge International (est. 2001).

This colorless solid is an important source of caesium ions in a variety of niche applications. Its crystal structure forms a major structural type where each caesium ion is coordinated by 8 chlorine ions. Caesium chloride dissolves in water. CsCl changes to NaCl structure on heating. Caesium chloride occurs naturally as impurities in carnallite (up to 0.002%), sylvite and kainite. Less than 20 tonnes of CsCl is produced annually worldwide, mostly from a caesium-bearing mineral pollucite.\n\nCaesium chloride is widely used medicine structure in isopycnic centrifugation for separating various types of DNA. It is a reagent in analytical chemistry, where it is used to identify ions by the color and morphology of the precipitate. When enriched in radioisotopes, such as CsCl or CsCl, caesium chloride is used in nuclear medicine applications such as treatment of cancer and diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Another form of cancer treatment was studied using conventional non-radioactive CsCl. Whereas conventional caesium chloride has a rather low toxicity to humans and animals, the radioactive form easily contaminates the environment due to the high solubility of CsCl in water. Spread of CsCl powder from a 93-gram container in 1987 in Goiânia, Brazil, resulted in one of the worst-ever radiation spill accidents killing four and directly affecting more than 100,000 people.\n\nThe caesium chloride structure adopts a primitive cubic lattice with a two-atom basis, where both atoms have eightfold coordination. The chloride atoms lie upon the lattice points at the edges of the cube, while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the center of the cubes. This structure is shared with CsBr and CsI and many binary metallic alloys. In contrast, the other alkaline halides have the sodium chloride (rocksalt) structure. When both ions are similar in size (Cs ionic radius 174 pm for this coordination number, Cl 181 pm) the CsCl structure is adopted, when they are different (Na ionic radius 102 pm, Cl 181 pm) the sodium chloride structure is adopted. Upon heating to above 445 °C, the normal caesium chloride structure (α-CsCl) converts to the β-CsCl form with the rocksalt structure (space group \"Fmm\"). The rocksalt structure is also observed at ambient conditions in nanometer-thin CsCl films grown on mica, LiF, KBr and NaCl substrates.\n\nCaesium chloride is colorless in the form of large crystals and white when powdered. It readily dissolves in water with the maximum solubility increasing from 1865 g/L at 20 °C to 2705 g/L at 100 °C. The crystals are very hygroscopic and gradually disintegrate at ambient conditions. Caesium chloride does not form hydrates.\nIn contrast to sodium chloride and potassium chloride, caesium chloride readily dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Caesium chloride has also a relatively high solubility in formic acid (1077 g/L at 18 °C) and hydrazine; medium solubility in methanol (31.7 g/L at 25 °C) and low solubility in ethanol (7.6 g/L at 25 °C), sulfur dioxide (2.95 g/L at 25 °C), ammonia (3.8 g/L at 0 °C), acetone (0.004% at 18 °C), acetonitrile (0.083 g/L at 18 °C), ethylacetates and other complex ethers, butanone, acetophenone, pyridine and chlorobenzene.\n\nDespite its wide band gap of about 8.35 eV at 80 K, caesium chloride weakly conducts electricity, and the conductivity is not electronic but ionic. The conductivity has a value of the order 10 S/cm at 300 °C. It occurs through nearest-neighbor jumps of lattice vacancies, and the mobility is much higher for the Cl than Cs vacancies. The conductivity increases with temperature up to about 450 °C, with an activation energy changing from 0.6 to 1.3 eV at about 260 °C. It then sharply drops by two orders of magnitude because of the phase transition from the α-CsCl to β-CsCl phase. The conductivity is also suppressed by application of pressure (about 10 times decrease at 0.4 GPa) which reduces the mobility of lattice vacancies.\n\nCaesium chloride completely dissociates upon dissolution in water, and the Cs cations are solvated in dilute solution. CsCl converts to caesium sulfate upon being heated in concentrated sulfuric acid or heated with caesium hydrogen sulfate at 550–700 °C:\n\nCaesium chloride forms a variety of double salts with other chlorides. Examples include 2CsCl·BaCl, 2CsCl·CuCl, CsCl·2CuCl and CsCl·LiCl, and with interhalogen compounds:\n\nCaesium chloride occurs naturally as an impurity in the halide minerals carnallite (KMgCl·6HO with up to 0.002% CsCl), sylvite (KCl) and kainite (MgSO·KCl·3HO), and in mineral waters. For example, the water of Bad Dürkheim spa, which was used in isolation of caesium, contained about 0.17 mg/L of CsCl. None of these minerals are commercially important.\n\nOn industrial scale, CsCl is produced from the mineral pollucite, which is powdered and treated with hydrochloric acid at elevated temperature. The extract is treated with antimony chloride, iodine monochloride, or cerium(IV) chloride to give the poorly soluble double salt, e.g.:\n\nTreatment of the double salt with hydrogen sulfide gives CsCl:\n\nHigh-purity CsCl is also produced from recrystallized (and ) by thermal decomposition:\n\nOnly about 20 tonnes of caesium compounds, with a major contribution from CsCl, were being produced annually around the 1970s and 2000s worldwide. Caesium chloride enriched with caesium-137 for radiation therapy applications is produced at a single facility Mayak in the Ural Region of Russia and is sold internationally through a UK dealer. The salt is synthesized at 200 °C because of its hygroscopic nature and sealed in a thimble-shaped steel container which is then enclosed into another steel casing. The sealing is required to protect the salt from moisture.\n\nIn the laboratory, CsCl can be obtained by treating caesium hydroxide, carbonate, caesium bicarbonate, or caesium sulfide with hydrochloric acid:\n\nCaesium chloride is the main precursor to caesium metal by high temperature reduction:\n\nA similar reaction – heating CsCl with calcium in vacuum in presence of phosphorus – was first reported in 1905 by the French chemist M. L. Hackspill and is still used industrially.\n\nCaesium hydroxide is obtained by electrolysis of aqueous caesium chloride solution:\n\nCaesium chloride is widely used in centrifugation in a technique known as isopycnic centrifugation. Centripetal and diffusive forces establish a density gradient that allow separation of mixtures on the basis of their molecular density. This technique allows separation of DNA of different densities (e.g. DNA fragments with differing A-T or G-C content). This application requires a solution with high density and yet relatively low viscosity, and CsCl suits it because of its high solubility in water, high density owing to the large mass of Cs, as well as low viscosity and high stability of CsCl solutions.\n\nCaesium chloride is rarely used in organic chemistry. It can act as a phase transfer catalyst reagent in selected reactions. One of these reactions is the synthesis of glutamic acid derivatives\n\nwhere TBAB is tetrabutylammonium bromide (interphase catalyst) and CPME is a cyclopentyl methyl ether (solvent).\n\nAnother reaction is substitution of tetranitromethane\n\nwhere DMF is dimethylformamide (solvent).\n\nCaesium chloride is a reagent in traditional analytical chemistry used for detecting inorganic ions via the color and morphology of the precipitates. Quantitative concentration measurement of some of these ions, e.g. Mg, with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, is used to evaluate the hardness of water.\n\nIt is also used for detection of the following ions:\nThe American Cancer Society states that \"available scientific evidence does not support claims that non-radioactive cesium chloride supplements have any effect on tumors.\" The Food and Drug Administration has warned about safety risks, including significant heart toxicity and death, associated with the use of cesium chloride in naturopathic medicine.\n\nCaesium chloride composed of radioisotopes such as CsCl and CsCl, is used in nuclear medicine, including treatment of cancer (brachytherapy) and diagnosis of myocardial infarction. In the production of radioactive sources, it is normal to choose a chemical form of the radioisotope which would not be readily dispersed in the environment in the event of an accident. For instance, radiothermal generators (RTGs) often use strontium titanate, which is insoluble in water. For teletherapy sources, however, the radioactive density (Ci in a given volume) needs to be very high, which is not possible with known insoluble caesium compounds. A thimble-shaped container of radioactive caesium chloride provides the active source.\n\nCaesium chloride is used in the preparation of electrically conducting glasses and screens of cathode ray tubes. In conjunction with rare gases CsCl is used in excimer lamps and excimer lasers. Other uses include activation of electrodes in welding; manufacture of mineral water, beer and drilling muds; and high-temperature solders. High-quality CsCl single crystals have a wide transparency range from UV to the infrared and therefore had been used for cuvettes, prisms and windows in optical spectrometers; this use was discontinued with the development of less hygroscopic materials.\n\nCsCl is a potent inhibitor of HCN channels, which carry the h-current in excitable cells such as neurons. Therefore, it can be useful in electrophyisiology experiments in neuroscience.\n\nCaesium chloride has a low toxicity to human and animals. Its median lethal dose (LD) in mice is 2300 mg per kilogram of body weight for oral administration and 910 mg/kg for intravenous injection. The mild toxicity of CsCl is related to its ability to lower the concentration of potassium in the body and partly substitute it in biochemical processes. When taken in large quantities, however, can cause a significant imbalance in potassium and lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest. However, caesium chloride powder can irritate the mucous membranes and cause asthma.\n\nBecause of its high solubility in water, caesium chloride is highly mobile and can even diffuse through concrete. This is a drawback for its radioactive form which urges a search for more stable radioisotope materials. Commercial sources of radioactive caesium chloride are well sealed in a double steel enclosure. However, in the Goiânia accident in Brazil, such a source containing about 93 gram of CsCl, was stolen from an abandoned hospital and forced open by two scavengers. The blue glow emitted in the dark by the radioactive caesium chloride attracted the thieves and their relatives who were unaware of the associated dangers and spread the powder. This resulted in one of the worst radiation spill accidents in which 4 people died within a month from the exposure, 20 showed signs of radiation sickness, 249 people were contaminated with radioactive caesium chloride, and about a thousand received a dose exceeding a yearly amount of background radiation. More than 110,000 people overwhelmed the local hospitals, and several city blocks had to be demolished in the cleanup operations. In the first days of the contamination, stomach disorders and nausea due to radiation sickness were experienced by several people, but only after several days one person associated the symptoms with the powder and brought a sample to the authorities.\n\n\n"}

He moved to Toronto in 1956 to pursue his profession as a municipal engineer designing urban services such as roads, water supply, sewage treatment, storm water run-off and waste management.\n\nInspired by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's initiative for a new flag for Canada, O'Donohue joined the Young Liberals in the early 1960s and made many trips to Ottawa with other Young Liberals to support the new flag proposal. As one of the party's first advocates for environmental causes, he encouraged the Young Liberals to become active in environmental issues. His Liberal Party national convention papers on water supply and sewage treatment received national attention.\n\nHe was elected as a Toronto City Council alderman in the 1966 municipal election. As an engineer, he focused on the need for a clearer understanding of the environment and, as a reformer, encouraged a new approach to local politics. He ran for Toronto mayor in 1972, losing to David Crombie, and again in 1978 to John Sewell. His 1978 defeat to the left-wing Sewell was seen as a result of vote splitting between O'Donohue and David Smith, a Liberal.\n\nO'Donohue and colleague Art Eggleton had agreed that only one of them should run against Sewell for mayor in 1980. They were to conduct a public opinion poll to determine which of them had the better chance of toppling the incumbent Mayor. However, according to O'Donohue's memoirs, Eggleton broke the pact and unilaterally declared himself a mayoralty candidate forcing O'Donohue to stay out of the race in order not to split the vote.\n\nO'Donohue was returned to City Council following a by-election after the death of City Councillor George Ben in 1980. He spent the next 14 years working to address the many energy and environmental problems facing urban areas.\n\nIn April 1989, O'Donohue introduced a by-law at City Council to ban the manufacture, sale, distribution and use of ozone depleting substances. It was the first such legislation anywhere and became a model for other cities. As a result, he was invited to make a presentation on the Toronto by-law at the Beckman Institute of the National Academies of Science and Engineering, in Irvine, California. While there, he consulted world-renowned chemist and later Nobel laureate Frank Sherwood Rowland on how to help prevent the dumping of ozone depleting substances into the atmosphere.\n\nIn 1992, he presented a motion to City Council to adopt a by-law prohibiting anyone from lying, sleeping or blocking city sidewalks. He argued that the city paid millions of dollars to make sufficient beds available for the homeless and there was no need for anyone to lie or sleep on the sidewalks. The motion lost and sleeping on the sidewalks has remained part of the landscape in downtown Toronto streets.\n\nIn the 1994 municipal election, he was defeated in Ward 3 by 28-year-old Mario Silva. The result was very close and subject to several recounts before the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that Silva had won by 15 votes.\n\nSince leaving politics, O'Donohue operated his own company until 2004, Environmental Probe Ltd., which helped developers fulfill the requirements of environmental assessments and laws.\n\nO'Donohue's son, Daniel, works for the city of Toronto as an evaluator of expropriated land.\n\nAn active supporter of Citizens for a Canadian Republic, O'Donohue made news in 2002 as a result of his legal challenge to the Act of Settlement barring Roman Catholics from the throne of Canada. He filed an application to the Ontario Superior Court, O'Donohue v. Her Majesty The Queen, calling on the court to strike down the discriminatory sections of the act as being in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. His case was dismissed in 2003 and his appeal was subsequently denied.\n\nFollowing the Changing Atmosphere Conference in July, 1988, O’Donohue embarked a plan to make Toronto a leading world city in urban environmental issues. He convinced City Council to apply to the province for special legislation to set up the Toronto Atmospheric Fund (TAF). In December 1992, approval was given.\n\nAs a member of the City Executive Committee, O’Donohue convinced City Council that $23 million – 20% of the moneys received by the City from the sale of its Jail Farm – should be given to TAF and he was appointed chairman.\n\n\n"}

Rates of bycatch are unusually high for shrimp fishing, with the capture of sea turtles being especially contentious.\n\nA shrimper is a fishing vessel rigged for shrimp fishing.\n\nThe term \"shrimp\", as used by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), covers all shrimp (Caridea) and prawns (Dendrobranchiata, comprising Penaeoidea and Sergestoidea) – a group formerly known as \"Natantia\". This nomenclature often differs from local use, in which the same species may be known by different names, or where different species may be known by the same name.\n\nSmall-scale local fishery for shrimp and prawns has existed for centuries and continues to form a large proportion of the world's shrimp fisheries. Trawling increased in scale with the introduction of otter boards, which use the flow of water to hold the trawling net open, and the introduction of steam-powered vessels, replacing the earlier sail-powered boats. Both of these developments took off in the 1880s, and were soon applied to shrimp fisheries, especially following the research effort of the Norwegian marine biologist Johan Hjort. Over time, the original open skiffs, long, were replaced by decked boats, to which diesel engines were added, allowing the boats to reach an average of .\n\nIn the United States, shrimp and prawn fisheries are second only to crab fishing in terms of importance. In the northern parts of the country, cold-water shrimp are targeted, while warm-water species are targeted along the south-eastern Atlantic coast, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the production is of warm-water species, but this is dwarfed by the imports of shrimp, mostly from aquaculture. This has led to international controversies, with some United States fishermen accusing countries such as Brazil, China, Ecuador, India, Thailand and Vietnam of dumping shrimp on the US market, while some of the producing nations protested to the World Trade Organization about duties levied by the US in response to the inferred dumping.\n\nShrimp fisheries produce unusually high levels of bycatch. Before the introduction of bycatch reduction devices in the 1980s, shrimp fishery had a bycatch ratio (ratio of the amount of non-target species caught to the amount of the target species caught) of 4.5–5.3:1. Since BRDs were introduced, the bycatch ratios may have been reduced by as much as 30%. Shrimp fisheries tend to \"capture more sea turtles than any other commercial fishery\".\n\nShrimps are from all different types of bodies of water in the world. Fewer than 300 species of shrimp and prawns are of commercial importance, out of a total of 3000 species. The catch is dominated by six \"species items\", which collectively account for 82% of the global catch. These are given in the table below:\nShrimp and prawn fisheries can be divided into cold-water, warm-water and paste shrimp fisheries, broadly corresponding to the three taxonomic categories Penaeoidea, Caridea and Sergestoidea, respectively.\n\nAlthough the various species of the genus \"Acetes\" are not always distinguished by fishermen, collectively they form the world's largest shrimp fishery. There are fisheries for \"Acetes\" in Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, but the vast majority of the catch is in China. The total catch is likely to be grossly under-recorded, but was estimated at 664,716 t in 2005. Within the Asia–Pacific region, the \"Acetes\" fishery is the fourth largest fishery by weight, after hairtails, anchovies and scads.\n\nWarm-water shrimp and prawn fisheries usually target several species, and are typically monitored in terms of the catch per unit effort (CPUE), rather than the complex models used for cold-water shrimp. Warm-water species (mainly \"Litopenaeus setiferus\", \"Farfantepenaeus aztecus\", and \"Farfantepenaeus duorarum\") provide more than 85% of the shrimp fishery in the United States, and are caught in the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Bycatch is a serious problem for warm-water shrimp fisheries, with inadvertent catches of sea turtles being among the most contentious issues.\n\nThe most important cold-water species is the \"northern prawn\", \"Pandalus borealis\", which accounts for 12% of the total shrimp and prawn catch. Up to 70% of the catch is landed in Canada and Greenland. The price of cold-water shrimp has been in decline since the 1990s, as a result of increased shrimp farming.\n\nBycatch is typically managed in cold-water shrimp trawling, and rates of bycatch are accordingly low, and the capture of sea turtles is rare in cold temperate waters. Bycatch is mostly reduced by the use of Nordmøre grids, which reduce the numbers of cod, haddock, Greenland halibut and redfish caught during shrimp trawls. The Nordmøre grid was invented by the Norwegian fisherman Paul Brattøy, primarily as a means of excluding jellyfish from shrimp catches, and introduced in 1989. This innovation causes a minimal reduction in the quantity of shrimp caught, but can reduce the amounts of bycatch by around 97%.\n\nFisheries for cold-water shrimp using pots, the bycatch is mostly of invertebrates, including squat lobsters, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms.\n\n"}
{"id": "2067460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067460", "title": "Corvus Corax (band)", "text": "Corvus Corax (band)\n\nCorvus Corax is a German band known for playing neo-Medieval music using authentic instruments. Their name is the Latin name for the common raven. The band was formed in 1989 by Castus Rabensang, Wim (Venustus) and Meister Selbfried (\"Master Selfpeace\") in East Germany. The band often uses bagpipes as the solo instrument; their live performances attract attention with the bizarre look of the musicians being reminiscent of ancient Greek myths: half-naked, dressed in unusual clothes, wearing primitive tribal decorations, often tattooed.\n\nToday the band consists of seven members: Castus Rabensang (\"Castus Ravensong\"), Xandru, Norri (formerly known as Harmann der Drescher), Hatz (\"hunt\"), Vit and Victorius. In May 2005 Meister Selbfried, one of the Corvus Corax founders and the researcher of medieval music, decided to cease his active musicianship and to dedicate himself mostly to managing Corvus Corax's own label Pica Records. His place in the line-up was taken by Jordon Finus in 2006.\n\nThe band releases its music through Pica Records in Europe and Noir Records in the USA. The Cantus Buranus projects have thus far been released in Europe by Roadrunner Europe.\n\nBecause medieval music theory was dominated by ecclesiastics, it is often difficult to determine from the existing manuscripts just how the secular medieval music sounded. Corvus Corax draws on a number of sources to try to make their music as authentic as possible: they have used documents that \"condemn profane music\" as an indicator of what the music might have sounded like, and drawn on nineteenth century scholarly treatises for information. In many cases these treatises are unreliable, as they impart more nineteenth century \"interpretations\" of medieval music than factual information on what the music was like.\n\nBut the profane music of the day was often accompanied by a droning bass tone similar to that generated by the bourdon stop on an organ, which is provided in Corvus Corax's case by the drones on their bagpipes. An inkling as to the harmonies used is found in a song by Walter von der Vogelweide, in which he calls for the song to be played \"the old way\", meaning harmonising with thirds. At the time, the third was considered an awkward, ugly interval by the sacred musician — like the tritone, or diabolus in musica — but it was a common interval in folk music.\n\nMatters are further complicated by the fact that each minstrel would add his personal interpretation to a piece, and that recorded (i.e. written) versions may differ depending on who did the transcribing, and where. It is on this that Corvus Corax's interpretation hinges: medieval popular music was played more from the heart than the brain, and despite making use of scholarship to give them a grounding, Corvus Corax attempts to maintain the spirited, free manner in which the minstrels themselves would have played the music.\n\nIn 1996 the band released the album \"Tanzwut\" which combined the elements of metal music with their brand sound of bagpipes. The CD turned out to be a commercially successful experiment and the band decided to continue the tradition of that album in a separate musical project called Tanzwut, which included Castus Rabensang (German Rabensang = ravensong), Wim, and Teufel (German Teufel = Devil) from Corvus Corax as well as three new members.\nIn 2005 Corvus Corax started the ambitious project \"Cantus Buranus\": a full-length opera set to the original \"Carmina Burana\" manuscript lyrics. The music for the opera was fully composed by the band and had no connection with the famous work by Carl Orff. It was performed with symphonic orchestra, choir and medieval ensemble, combining traditional symphonism with medieval minstrel-like melodies. The project included a CD recording, a DVD, as well as live performances. A live CD and DVD recording of Cantus Buranus was released in March 2006.\n\n2005 also marked the band's debut concerts in the USA. The band performed four sets on each of four different days in mid-October, not far from Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. There was also a \"secret show\" held for employees of the Faire. Footage shot by the band members and crew was assembled into a featurette that was included as a bonus track on the US edition of the band's live DVD, \"Gaudia Vite.\"\n\nOut on August 1, 2008 via the band owned label Pica Music, Cantus Buranus II was released., It is a new orchestral recording of songs from the Medieval manuscript \"Carmina Burana\". The Berlin-based act created a composition for orchestra, choir and a Medieval ensemble and recorded the CD and DVD live in the Museum Island in front of 5000 people.\n\nCorvus Corax performed a live rendition of their song \"Ballade De Mercy\" in the pilot episode of the HBO TV series \"Game of Thrones\", based on the fantasy series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George R.R. Martin. The pilot episode was changed dramatically before it aired on TV, and the performance was not used.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three separate comic book limited series (each limited to four issues), published between 1989 and 1991, including \"Damage Control: The Movie\" (1991).\n\nThe group has also had frequent minor roles in many other Marvel comics, including an important role in the \"Civil War\"; \"Irredeemable Ant-Man\"; and the first issue of \"World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control\", a three-issue limited series tying into \"World War Hulk\", was published in January 2008.\n\nDwayne McDuffie, who co-created the concept with artist Ernie Colón and wrote Damage Control's initial non-adventures, pitched \"Damage Control\" to Marvel as \"a sitcom within the Marvel Universe\".\n\nDamage Control received an entry in the \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89\" #2.\n\nDamage Control was founded by Ms. Anne Marie Hoag and was originally owned by Tony Stark and Wilson Fisk, each owning half the stock of the company, though Stark felt uneasy cooperating with Fisk, a notorious criminal. The company was headquartered in New York's Flatiron Building.\n\nDamage Control employees have been in the middle of a breakout at the Vault, confronted Doctor Doom, have been threatened with death by the Punisher and have met vastly powerful cosmic entities such as the Silver Surfer and Galactus. They have \"fought\" side by side with the X-Men, socialized with the New Warriors and were even almost menaced by the Hulk.\n\nWhen Ms. Hoag was offered a job in government, she nominated Robin Chapel as her replacement. Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he did not want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of Acts of Vengeance (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages.\n\nThe confrontation with the Kingpin causes unexpected results. The Damage Control staff find that a movie has been put out, a fictionalized version of their confrontation with the Kingpin. At the wrap party for the premiere, the Damage Control staff is summoned by the Silver Surfer to help deal with Edifice Rex, a former employee. He had gained cosmic powers and this, combined with an anal-retentive personality, threatens the cosmos. Several of the employees meet and discuss the problem with other cosmic entities, such as Galactus and Lord Chaos. Robin Chapel eventually solves this problem by firing Rex.\n\nAfter a super-fight destroys the Washington Monument Damage Control is contracted and fixes the damage off-panel. Their bill is seen in a pile of paperwork.\n\nHercules is seen working with Damage Control, on one occasion serving a community service sentence levied as punishment for a drunken rampage. Hercules becomes a full-fledged employee, forced to earn a living after the Constrictor successfully sues the demigod for injuries incurred in his apprehension.\n\nDamage Control is seen during the \"Civil War\". The super-villain Nitro, who blew up the town of Stamford, killing hundreds and starting the Civil War, reveals that a \"Walter Declun\" has provided him with Mutant Growth Hormone. Via Namor, Wolverine learns Walter is the CEO of Damage Control, Inc. A brief scene shows that Walter and one other employee of the firm are complicit in using Nitro to boost the firm's profits.\n\nThis leads Wolverine to Anne-Marie Hoag, Damage Control's President (and a brief confrontation with Ann, long-time D.C. receptionist). Anne-Marie reveals that Declun and his investors took a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. D.C. has also obtained the Stamford reconstruction contract and the contract to train and evaluate registered super-beings. Anne-Marie has suspected Declun of illegal activities but did not have strong enough evidence to counter his ties with Washington D.C. and the President.\n\nIn his battle against Declun and Damage Control, which includes destroying many D.C. assets such as company equipment to robbing overseas banks with D.C. Holdings to forcing major stock holders to liquidate their stock. Wolverine later engages in a fight with a team of D.C. Security personnel who are equipped with Mandroid Armor, S.H.I.E.L.D. weaponry, Stark Enterprises technology and other items salvaged from superhuman fights until the super-hero Sentry shows up and captures Wolverine, who is then delivered to SHIELD, which is under Maria Hill's leadership. But Wolverine later escapes. After making his way back to Damage Control offices, he confronts Declun, at which point the corrupt businessman takes a dose of Mutant Growth Hormone in response to Wolverine's threats; temporally giving him super-human powers. During the fight Wolverine appears to kill Declun by stabbing him through his eye sockets. However, Declun survives the fight.\n\nJohn Porter also becomes involved with the Civil War. When FF members Susan and Reed Richards temporarily separate over ethical differences, their emotional split-up was punctuated by Susan using her force fields to punch a three-foot circular hole through every floor of the building. Porter then shows up and estimates the repairs will be $789,000. He also thanks Reed for the work as lately.\n\nDamage Control creates a new division called, \"Search and Rescue\" that focuses on finding survivors in wreckage. They inadvertently hire Eric O'Grady, thinking he is a hero called \"Slaying Mantis\", but he was actually looting after a Mighty Avengers battle.\n\nThe company helped clean up New York City after the events of \"World War Hulk\". Tom Foster, the nephew of the late Bill Foster and the new Goliath, joins the company, as do fellow superhumans Monstro and Visioneer. The undamaged Flatiron Building is once again used as their headquarters. As a company, Damage Control secures all relevant resources and a makeshift superhero rescue force, as many people were left behind when New York was evacuated for the events of 'World War Hulk'. Damage Control also collects various extraordinary resources left behind from the confrontation, such as the adamantium \"bullets\", an alien A.I. and alien metals.\n\nDuring the reconstruction, a strange side-effect of one of the Hulk's destroyed machines causes the Chrysler Building to come to life. It wants to leave the city and see the world, but John Porter is able to negotiate a deal by which it is allowed to leave one month a year; as John notes, no one comes to Manhattan in August.\n\nThe company again gets the bid to rebuild Avengers Mansion just as a new team, led by Luke Cage, is moving in. Ms. Hoag hints at a secret past with Cage.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Island\" storyline, Damage Control is seen working with the superheroes to clean up the destruction and chaos caused by the madness of a giant spider monster in the middle of Manhattan. Along with passing out pants to formerly spider-shaped New Yorkers, Damage set to work carting away parts of the Spider Queen's giant arachnid body. At least one Damage Control team had been infiltrated and controlled by the Jackal, a self-admitted mad scientist who wanted DNA from the spider monster.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War II\" storyline, Monstro finds Trull the Unhuman vandalizing Damage Control equipment and busts him. Upon Monstro empathizing him, Trull the Unhuman was convinced to give up on his goals. Trull the Unhuman joined up with Damage Control and became their spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Damage Control is also a construction and demolition company. The Ultimate version of the Wrecking Crew are employees of Damage Control as debuted in \"Ultimate Spider-Man \"#86. They are then empowered and quit the business to become villains.\n\n\nIn October 2015, ABC ordered a put pilot for the live action Marvel Television comedy series \"Damage Control\". The series was being developed by Ben Karlin, who was also writing the script for the project and serving as executive producer. The series had previously been implied by then ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee to have begun airing as early as the 2016–17 television season. Since then, there have been no further announcements.\n\nDamage Control appeared in the 2017 film \"\" from Marvel Studios and Columbia Pictures. In the film, it is a government agency known as the U.S. Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), a joint venture between Stark Industries and the United States government to clean up after the Battle of New York, an act which drives Adrian Toomes' salvaging company out of business and causes him to subsequently become the Vulture.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2067514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067514", "title": "Scandinavian prehistory", "text": "Scandinavian prehistory\n\nThe Scandinavian Peninsula became ice-free around the end of the last ice age. The Nordic Stone Age begins at that time, with the Upper Paleolithic Ahrensburg culture, giving way to the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers by the 7th millennium BC (Maglemosian culture c. 7500–6000 BC, Kongemose culture c. 6000–5200 BC, Ertebølle culture c. 5300–3950 BC). The Neolithic stage is marked by the Funnelbeaker culture (4000–2700 BC), followed by the Pitted Ware culture (3200–2300 BC).\n\nAround 2800 BC, metal was introduced in Scandinavia in the Corded Ware culture. In much of Scandinavia, a Battle Axe culture became prominent, known from some 3,000 graves. The period 2500–500 BC also left many visible remains to modern times, most notably the many thousands rock carvings (petroglyphs) in western Sweden at Tanumshede and in Norway at Alta. A more advanced culture came with the Nordic Bronze Age (c. 1800–500 BC). It was followed by the Iron Age in the 4th century BC.\n\nThe pre-history of Scandinavia begins at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, following the last glacial period's receding Fenno-Scandian ice sheet.\n\nParts of Denmark, Scania and the Norwegian coast line were free from ice around 13,000 BC, and around 10,000 BC the rim of ice was around Dalsland, Västergötland and Östergötland. It wasn't until 7000 BC that all of Svealand and the modern coastal regions of northeastern Sweden were free of ice, although the huge weight of the ice sheet had caused isostatic depression of Fennoscandia, placing large parts of eastern Sweden and western Finland underwater.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the time following the last ice age period begins at circa 9500 BC and is called at first the Yoldia Stage, after the Yoldia Sea, then the Ancylus Stage, after the Ancylus Lake in turn named after \"Ancylus fluviatilis\", a small fresh-water gastropod from this time. At this time, Denmark and Sweden were joined and the \"Baltic Sea\" of the age was a fresh water lake called the Ancylus Lake. The Ancylus age is followed by formation of the Littorina Sea and the Litorina Stage (named after the \"Littorina littorea\" mollusc) at around 6200 BC.\n\nWith the first human colonization of this new land (the territory of modern Sweden was partly under water though, and with radically different coastlines) during the Ancylus and Litorina ages begins the Nordic Stone Age. In recent years there have been archaeological finds in caves which strongly suggest human inhabitation of Scandinavia \"before\" the Weichsel glaciation, at least 50,000 years ago, presumably by Neanderthals.\n\nAs the ice receded reindeer grazed on the plains of Denmark and southernmost Sweden. This was the land of the Ahrensburg culture, whose members hunted over territories 100,000 km² vast and lived in teepees on the tundra. On this land there was little forest but arctic white birch and rowan, but the taiga slowly appeared.\n\nThe Scandinavian peninsula was the last part of Europe to be colonized after the Last Glacial Maximum. The migration routes, cultural networks, and the genetic makeup of the first Scandinavians remain elusive and several hypotheses exist based on archaeology, climate modeling, and genetics. Analysis of genomes of early Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHGs) from the cave Stora Förvar on Stora Karlsö, Stora Bjers on Gotland, Hummervikholmen in Norway showed that migrations followed two routes: one from the south and another from the northeast along the ice-free Norwegian Atlantic coast. These groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a population more diverse than contemporaneous central and western European hunter-gatherers.\n\nIn the 7th millennium BC, when the reindeer and their hunters had moved for northern Scandinavia, forests had been established in the land. A culture called the Maglemosian culture lived in Denmark and southern Sweden, and north of them, in Norway and most of southern Sweden, the Fosna-Hensbacka culture, who lived mostly along the shores of the thriving forests. Utilizing fire, boats and stone tools enabled these Stone Age inhabitants to survive life in northern Europe. The northern hunter/gatherers followed the herds and the salmon runs, moving south during the winters, and moving north again during the summers. These early peoples followed cultural traditions similar to those practiced throughout other regions in the far-north areas, including modern Finland, Russia, and across the Bering Strait into the northernmost strip of North America (containing portions of today's Alaska and Canada)\n\nThe Maglemosian people lived in forest and wetland environments using fishing and hunting tools made from wood, bone and flint microliths. A characteristic of the culture are the sharply edged microliths of flintstone which were used for spear heads and arrowheads. Microliths finds are more sparse from c. 6000 BC and the period is said to transit into the Kongemose culture (c. 6000–5200 BC). The finds from this period are characterised by long flintstone flakes which were used for making the characteristic rhombic arrowheads, scrapers, drills, awls and toothed blades.\n\nDuring the 6th millennium BC, southern Scandinavia was clad in lush forests of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. In these forests roamed animals such as aurochs, wisent, moose and red deer. Now, the Kongemose culture lived off these animals. Like their predecessors, they also hunted seals and fished in the rich waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden, called the Nøstvet and Lihult cultures, descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures. These cultures still hunted, in the end of the 6th millennium BC when the Kongemose culture was replaced by the Ertebølle culture in the south.\n\nDuring the 5th millennium BC, the Ertebølle culture took up pottery from the Linear Pottery culture in the south, whose members had long cultivated the land and kept animals. About 4000 BC south Scandinavia up to River Dalälven in Sweden became part of the Funnelbeaker culture (4000–2700 BC), a culture that originated in southern parts of Europe and slowly advanced up through today's Uppland, Sweden. Tribes along the coasts of Svealand, Götaland, Åland, northeastern Denmark and southern Norway learnt new technologies that became the Pitted Ware culture (3200–2300 BC). The Pitted Ware culture then developed along Sweden's east coast as a return to a hunting economy in the mid-4th millennium BC (see the Alvastra pile-dwelling).\n\nIt is not known what language these early Scandinavians spoke. It might have been similar to Basque, due to the distribution of the monuments by early megalith builders. Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, they were overrun by new groups who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European, the Battle-Axe culture. This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord, and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages. This new culture had the battle axe as a status symbol, and were cattle herders. However, soon a new invention would arrive, that would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age.\n\nDuring the Nordic Bronze Age from c. 1700–500 BC, an advanced civilization appears in Denmark, parts of Sweden and parts of Norway. They manufactured bronze tools and weapons as well as jewellery and artifacts of bronze and gold. All the bronze and gold was imported and it has been assumed that the civilization was founded in amber trade, through contacts with Central European and Mediterranean cultures.\n\nThe period between 2300 and 500 BC was the most intensive petroglyph-carving period in Scandinavia, with carvings depicting agricultural activities, animals, nature, hunts, ships, ceremonies, warfare, etc.. Petroglyphs with themes of a sexual nature have also been found in Bohuslän, dating from 800 to 500 BC.\n\nTacitus (about 98 AD) described a nation called \"Suiones\" living on an island in the Ocean. These Suiones had ships that were peculiar because they had a prow in both ends (the shape we recognise as Viking ships). This word \"Suiones\" is the same name as in Anglo-Saxon \"Sweon\" whose country in Angle-Saxon was called \"Sweoland\" (Svealand). In \"Beowulf\", this tribe is also called \"Sweoðeod\", from which the name \"Sweden\" is derived, and the country has the name \"Sweorice\", which is an old form, in Old English (Anglo-Saxon), of the present Swedish name for Sweden.\n\nIn the 6th century the Ostrogoth Jordanes mentioned a tribe named \"Suehans\" which is the same name as Tacitus' \"Suiones\". He also unwittingly described the same tribe by a different name, the \"Suetidi\" which is the same as an old name for Sweden, \"Svíþjóð\" and the English \"Sweoðeod\".\n\nSeveral sources, such as \"Beowulf\", \"Ynglingatal\", \"Ynglinga saga\", Saxo Grammaticus and \"Historia Norwegiae\", mention a number of Swedish kings who lived in the 6th century, such as Eadgils, Ohthere and Onela, as well as a number of Geatish kings. Some of these kings were in all likelihood historic kings, although the sources sometimes give contradictory information, such as the death of Ottar. See Mythological kings of Sweden and Semi-legendary kings of Sweden.\n\nIn those days the kings were warlords rather than kings as we understand that title today, and what was to become Sweden, Norway and Denmark in a \"modern\" sense, were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed constantly as the kings killed each other, and had the local assemblies accept them as kings. The politics of these early kingdoms are retold in \"Beowulf\" (see e.g. the semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars) and the Norse sagas.\n\nOne of the most powerful kings was the Swedish king who according to early sources only ruled what is today eastern Svealand. It is unknown when it happened and it probably happened several times, but when sources become more reliable the territories of the Swedish kings include Västergötland and other parts of Götaland. This stage is by some considered to be the beginning of Sweden, as we know it today.\n\n\n"}

He was considered to be a popular and engaging personality who commentated on many sports, particularly winter sports and football. It was not unusual for Norwegians to turn off the sound on the TV and listen to him on the radio instead.\n\nIn September 1981 he came to international prominence when he said “Your boys took a hell of a beating” in commentary following Norway's 2–1 victory against England in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nLillelien went to Northwestern University to study journalism in 1948. After going back to Norway for his military service, he got a job in the newspaper Fremtiden, after which he joined the Norwegian broadcasting network.\n\nIn 1963 he began a long-term working relationship with former Olympic champion skier Håkon Brusveen at a cross country ski race at Holmenkollen. This collaboration would last for the rest of Lillelien's working days. Brusveen continued to work for NRK after Lillelien's death.\n\nAlthough privately Lillelien was quite reserved and reflective, he developed a gregarious on-air persona. He said \"We shouldn't necessarily make a boring radio programme even if it is a boring football match. We should make a sports show that excites people\".\n\nHe continued to work in broadcasting until just before his death from cancer in 1987.\n\nLillelien commentated on radio on Norway's 2–1 victory against England in a World Cup UEFA qualifier in Oslo on 9 September 1981. At the end of the match, alternating between the English and Norwegian language, he exultantly proclaimed amidst scenes of jubilant Norway supporters and players in the football stadium:\n\n\"\"We are best in the world! We have beaten England! England, birthplace of giants\"\",\n\nbefore taunting a roll call of English historical figures:\n\nA significant portion of his excitement was due to how English football was held in very high regard in Norway at the time, as it was often easier to watch the Football League First Division on television in Norway than in England during the 1970s, with one match broadcast live each weekend, and with score updates from other simultaneous matches.\n\nAlthough the broadcast was initially meant solely for the Norwegian home audience its content soon made its way across the North Sea and became legendary in the history of sports commentary in England.\n\nThe full Norwegian/English version reads as follows:\n\nThe full version, completely translated to English:\n\nIn 2002 Lillelien's words were designated the greatest piece of sports commentary ever by \"The Observer\"'s \"Sport Monthly\" magazine. Such is its place in British sporting culture that parodies of the commentary have been written to celebrate domestic sporting victories, such as the following when the England cricket team beat Australia to regain the Ashes in September 2005:\n\nAnd again, when England's cricket team finally won a game against New Zealand in the 2006/7 one-day series, the BBC's web coverage came up with:\n\nFollowing Scotland's 2-1 victory against Norway in Oslo in September 2005, the \"Daily Record\" parodied the quote, using known Norwegians:\n\nThe Deputy Editor of the \"Daily Record\" at the time, Murray Foote, later issued an apology for the inclusion of Vidkun Quisling in the quotation:\n\nIn advance of the Scotland v Norway game at Hampden on 10 October 2008, a parody was created by Tennent Caledonian Breweries (sponsor of the Scottish National Team) for radio and subsequently animated and posted on YouTube.\n\nFollowing Manchester University winning University Challenge against the University of Cambridge Pembroke College in March 2012, a commentator for the Manchester student newspaper observed \"We have beaten Pembroke College, Cambridge! Cambridge, birthplace of giants. Rab Butler, Clive James, Ted Hughes, William Pitt the Younger, Eric Idle, Peter Cook, Bill Oddie! Bill Oddie, can you hear me? Your boys took a hell of a beating!\"\n\nThe speech is also parodied in the 2001 British drama film \"Mean Machine\", starring Vinnie Jones. In the film, at the conclusion of the match between the guards and the prisoners at the fictional Longmarsh prison, in a 3-2 win for the prisoners, the commentators, Bob Likely (Jason Flemyng) and Bob Carter (Jake Abraham) quoted \"Guards of Pentonville, Guards of Wandsworth, Walton nick in Liverpool, Policemen of Britain, Traffic Wardens, Parole officers, Wheel clampers, your boys have taken a helluva beating today, a helluva beating!\" \n\n\n\n"}

The structure was designed by the Iowa State Highway Commission, and was built by the Industrial Construction Company of Minneapolis (contractor), Gould Construction Company of Davenport, and Roy Ryan & Sons of Evanston, Indiana who was responsible for the substructure. The bridge opened on October 27, 1966, and is maintained by the Illinois Department of Transportation.

In 1965, structural steel was installed on the bridge. During that year, officials inspected the bridge. On June 29, 1966, the bridge's center span was installed. The bridge opened to traffic on October 27, 1966.\n\nIn 1995, the bridge was renamed for former U.S. Representative Fred Schwengel.

On May 12, 2009, the eastbound lane of the bridge closed after a crack was found in the top flange of the beam. As a result, inspectors visited the bridge and determined on how to repair the beam. The bridge reopened in August 2009. On April 10, 2015, the westbound lanes of the bridge closed for repairs on the joints and reopened on April 14, 2015.\nStarting in 2020, the Illinois Department of Transportation will begin a study, which is expected to cost $20,000, to replace the span. The plan from 2020 to 2025 is to spend $304.5 million on the bridge. By 2025, Illinois is expected to spend $23 billion on concrete, as well as fixing and expanding of roadways and 9 million square feet (836,000 square meters) of bridge decks. The Illinois department will be the lead agency on the project with the state of Iowa sharing in the costs.\n\n\n"}

The championship was originally created in June 1966 but WCWA's predecessor NWA Big Time Wrestling (BTW), billed as the local version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship before being renamed the NWA American Heavyweight Championship in May 1968. In 1982 Big Time Wrestling rebranded themselves as \"World Class Championship Wrestling\" (WCCW) and the championship was renamed the WCCW American Heavyweight Championship. In 1986 WCCW withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance, creating the World Class Wrestling Association, replacing the WCCW American Heavyweight Championship with the WCWA Heavyweight Championship, replacing the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship as the top title recognized by the promotion. In 1989, the WCWA championship was unified with the AWA World Heavyweight Championship to become the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship as WCWA merged with the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) to become the United States Wrestling Association. In 1990 WCWA split from the USWA, but the promotion folded without determining a WCWA World Heavyweight Champion. As it is a professional wrestling championship, the WCWA World Heavyweight Chamionship was not won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match.\n\nThe first recognized Texas based NWA United States Champion was Fritz Von Erich, introducing the championship to his Southwest Sports promotion as the top championship in his territory. Fritz Von Erich would go on to win the championship a record setting 20 times. At the time it was not unusual for the promoter, if he was also an active wrestler to hold the championship multiple times, being that he always be available to work shows and face off against various \"outsiders\". Fritz' last reign was on June 4, 1982 16 years after his first title victory. Rick Rude was the last WCCW American Heavyweight Champion and announced as the first WCWA World Heavyweight Champion on February 21, 1986. Jerry Lawler was the final champion, winning it on April 14, 1989, followed by the announcement that the championship had been unified with the AWA World Heavyweight Champion in September 1990. The longest confirmed reign, Fritz Von Erich's fifth reign over all, lasted from March 27, 1967 to April 5, 1986 for a total of 375 days. Von Erich's final reign was also the shortest in history, as he vacated moments after winning it in the main event of the Fritz Von Erich Retirement Show.

It is sometimes called Carn Meini (\"Rock of Stones\"), but this is a modern corruption of the original name.\n\nCarn Menyn sits on top of the Preseli ridge, close to the stone setting of Bedd Arthur. It consists of an outcrop of white spotted dolerite similar to that of other tors in the area, and several other prehistoric sites have been identified nearby. The mountain-top setting provides commanding views over the Gower Peninsula and across Cardigan Bay to the Llŷn Peninsula.\n\nCarn Menyn is believed by some to have been the main source for the bluestones used at Stonehenge. Sir Andrew Ramsey first suggested it as a contender in the mid-nineteenth century. In the early 1920s HH Thomas showed through petrographic analysis that many of the bluestones had come from the Preseli Hills, and in 2005 work led by Timothy Darvill and Geoff Wainwright supported the idea that Carn Menyn was the primary quarry. This is disputed by others, and Williams-Thorpe and others from the Open University have suggested that the Stonehenge bluestones came from at least twenty different places, with Carn Goedog about one mile to the west as the most likely source for the spotted dolerites.\n\nSurvey work between 2002 and 2004 by the Strumble-Preseli Ancient Communities and Environment Study (SPACES) recorded an enclosure on the upper part of the outcrop consisting of a steep-sided promontory with a bank of stones across its neck. Although only around 3,500 square metres in area the enclosure contains several dolerite outcrops, each naturally fractured into shapes that could be formed into columns. Semi-worked megaliths lay scattered around apparently having been simply levered out from the larger outcrops. It is debatable whether these \"semi-worked megaliths\" are prehistoric or recent, since this area has been used by the farming community for at least 300 years for the collection of stone gateposts, lintels and building slabs.\n\nGeochemical analysis has shown that some of the bluestones from the inner horseshoe at Stonehenge probably came from Carn Menyn, Carn Goedog, Carn Breseb, Cerrig Marchogion and other sites in the Preseli Hills, while rhyolite fragments may have come from Carn Alw and further afield.\n\nEvidence for later exploitation of the stone at Carn Menyn has been found despite the site's remoteness. Two nearby chapels and many houses in the area were built from Carn Menyn stone. However, this stone was not used preferentially in megalithic or ritual structures—stone from all of the outcrops or tors on Mynydd Preseli has been used in buildings and field boundaries, so long as access by horse-drawn sleds and carts was possible.\n\nIn April 2005 an excavation at the site clarified the extent of the enclosure but did not retrieve any cultural material. The same year, the then Archdruid of the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards, Robyn Lewis, wrote to the Daily Telegraph proposing that the Bluestones be returned from Stonehenge to the Preseli Hills. This was also the subject of a stage play called \"Bringing Back the Bluestones\".\n\nGeological studies by Bevins, Ixer and Pearce in 2013 and 2014 have confirmed the suggestion of the OU team that the spotted dolerites at Stonehenge have come from Carn Goedog and not Carn Menyn.\n\n\n\n"}

PdCl is a common starting material in palladium chemistry – palladium-based catalysts are of particular value in organic synthesis. It is prepared by the reaction of chlorine with palladium metal at high temperatures.\n\nTwo forms of PdCl are known, denoted α and β. In both forms, the palladium centres adopt a square-planar coordination geometry that is characteristic of Pd(II). Furthermore, in both forms, the Pd(II) centers are linked by μ-chloride bridges. The α-form of PdCl is a polymer, consisting of \"infinite\" slabs or chains. The β-form of PdCl is molecular, consisting of an octahedral cluster of six Pd atoms. Each of the twelve edges of this octahedron is spanned by Cl. PtCl adopts similar structures, whereas NiCl adopts the CdCl motif, featuring hexacoordinated Ni(II).\n\nTwo further polymorphs, γ-PdCl and δ-PdCl, have been reported and show negative thermal expansion. The high-temperature δ form contains planar ribbons of edge‐connected PdCl squares, like α-PdCl. The low‐temperature γ form has corrugated layers of corner‐connected PdCl squares.\n\nPalladium(II) chloride is prepared by dissolving palladium metal in aqua regia or hydrochloric acid in the presence of chlorine. Alternatively, it may be prepared by heating palladium sponge metal with chlorine gas at 500 °C.\n\nPalladium(II) chloride is a common starting point in the synthesis of other palladium compounds. It is not particularly soluble in water or non-coordinating solvents, so the first step in its utilization is often the preparation of labile but soluble Lewis base adducts, such as bis(benzonitrile)palladium dichloride and bis(acetonitrile)palladium dichloride. These complexes are prepared by treating PdCl with hot solutions of the nitriles:\n\nAlthough occasionally recommended, inert-gas techniques are not necessary if the complex is to be used \"in situ\". As an example, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride may be prepared from palladium(II) chloride by reacting it with triphenylphosphine in benzonitrile:\n\nFurther reduction in the presence of more triphenylphosphine gives tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0); the second reaction may be carried out without purifying the intermediate dichloride:\n\nAlternatively, palladium(II) chloride may be solubilized in the form of the tetrachloropalladate anion, e.g. sodium tetrachloropalladate, by reacting with the appropriate alkali metal chloride in water: Palladium(II) chloride is insoluble in water, whereas the product dissolves:\n\nThis compound may also further react with phosphines to give phosphine complexes of palladium.\n\nPalladium chloride may also be used to give heterogeneous palladium catalysts: palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on carbon, and palladium chloride on carbon.\n\nEven when dry, palladium(II) chloride is able to rapidly stain stainless steel. Thus, palladium(II) chloride solutions are sometimes used to test for the corrosion-resistance of stainless steel.\n\nPalladium(II) chloride is sometimes used in carbon monoxide detectors. Carbon monoxide reduces palladium(II) chloride to palladium:\n\nResidual PdCl is converted to red PdI, the concentration of which may be determined colorimetrically:\n\nPalladium(II) chloride is used in the Wacker process for production of aldehydes and ketones from alkenes.\n\nPalladium(II) chloride can also be used for the cosmetic tattooing of leukomas in the cornea.\n"}

Toler Jr., April 28, 1874 – February 12, 1947) was an American actor, playwright and theatre director. The second European-American actor to play the role of Charlie Chan on screen, he is best remembered for his portrayal of the Chinese-American detective in 22 films made between 1938 and 1946. Before becoming Chan, Toler played supporting roles in 50 motion pictures and was a highly regarded comic actor on the Broadway stage.\n\nHooper G. Toler Jr., who was called Sidney Toler from childhood, was born April 28, 1874, in Warrensburg, Missouri. He showed an early interest in the theater, acting in an amateur production of \"Tom Sawyer\" at the age of seven. He left the University of Kansas and became a professional actor in 1892, playing the heavy in a performance of a melodrama called \"The Master Man\" in Kansas City. In 1894 he joined the Corse Payton company and toured for four years. His success in leading roles at the Lee Avenue Academy in Brooklyn brought an invitation to join the company of Julia Marlowe. He toured with her for two years, playing the Duke of Buckingham in \"When Knighthood Was in Flower\".\n\nIn Brooklyn, Toler played leads with the Columbia Theatre Stock Company and sang baritone with the Orpheum Theatre's operatic stock company. In 1903, he made his Broadway debut in the musical comedy, \"The Office Boy\".\n\nOver the next nine years Toler had his own theatre companies in Portland, Maine, and Halifax, Nova Scotia—at one point having 12 stock companies on the road. He began a prolific career as a playwright, writing \"The Belle of Richmond\", \"The Dancing Master\", \"The House on the Sands\" and more than 70 other plays. One particular success was a war play called \"The Man They Left Behind\", which was presented by 67 companies in a period of three months and by 18 different companies in a single week.\n\nIn 1921 Paramount Pictures released two films based on Toler's plays: \"The Bait\", adapted from \"The Tiger Lady\", and \"A Heart to Let\", based on \"Agatha's Aunt\", which Toler adapted from a novel by Harriet Lummis Smith. Three of his plays reached Broadway: \"The Golden Days\" (1921), which starred Helen Hayes, \"The Exile\" (1923), and \"Ritzy\" (1930).\n\nToler earned fame as an actor on the Broadway stage, working for David Belasco for 14 years. He was best known for his comedy roles, from the detective-butler in \"On the Hiring Line\" (1919)—a performance that \"The New York Times\" called \"one of the comedy high spots of the week\"—to Cool Kelly the iceman in \"It's a Wise Child\" (1929–30).\n\nIn 1929 Toler made his first film, \"Madame X\" , and in 1931, after the Boston run of \"It's a Wise Child\", he moved to Hollywood. He played supporting roles in films including \"White Shoulders\" (1931), \"Tom Brown of Culver\" (1932), \"Blonde Venus\" (1932), \"The Phantom President\" (1932), \"The World Changes\" (1933), \"Spitfire\" (1934), \"Operator 13\" (1934), \"The Call of the Wild\" (1935), \"Three Godfathers\" (1936), \"The Gorgeous Hussy\" (1936), \"Double Wedding\" (1937), \"The Mysterious Rider\" (1938) and \"Law of the Pampas\" (1939).\n\nFollowing the death of Warner Oland, Twentieth Century-Fox began the search for a new Charlie Chan. Thirty-four actors were tested before the studio decided on Sidney Toler. Twentieth Century-Fox announced its choice on October 18, 1938, and filming began less than a week later on \"Charlie Chan in Honolulu\", which had been originally scripted for Warner Oland and Keye Luke. Toler's portrayal of the Chinese detective in \"Charlie Chan in Honolulu\" was very well received. Besides Toler, there was another change in the series. (Victor) Sen Yung, as Number Two Son Jimmy, replaced Number One Son Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Toler's Chan, rather than merely mimicking the character that Oland had portrayed, had a somewhat sharper edge that was well suited for the rapid changes of the times, both political and cultural. When needed, Charlie Chan now displayed overt sarcasm, usually toward his son Jimmy.\n\nThrough four years and eleven films, Toler played Charlie Chan for Twentieth Century-Fox. However, in 1942, following the completion of \"Castle in the Desert\", Fox concluded the series. The wartime collapse of the international film market may have been a factor, but the main reason was that Fox was curtailing virtually all of its low-budget series. Fox's other \"B\" series — Jane Withers, \"Michael Shayne\", \"The Cisco Kid\" — also ended that year. Only Laurel and Hardy remained in Fox's \"B\" unit, until it shut down at the end of 1944.\n\nWith Fox no longer producing Chan films, Toler bought the screen rights to the Charlie Chan character from Eleanor Biggers Cole, the widow of Chan's creator, Earl Derr Biggers. Toler had hoped that if he could find someone to produce new Charlie Chan films, starring himself, Fox would distribute them. Fox declined, having already dropped the series, but Toler sold the idea to Monogram Pictures, a lower-budget film studio. Philip N. Krasne, a Hollywood lawyer who invested in film productions, partnered with James S. Burkett to produce the Monogram Chans.\n\nWith the release of \"Charlie Chan in the Secret Service\" (1944), the effects of a more limited budget were apparent. Production values were no match for those of Fox; Monogram's budgets were typically about 40% of what Fox's had been. In fairness to Monogram, the films did gradually improve, with \"The Chinese Cat\", \"The Shanghai Cobra\", and \"Dark Alibi\" often cited as favorites by fans. Cast changes were again made: Sen Yung's Jimmy was replaced by Benson Fong as Number Three Son Tommy, and Mantan Moreland played the ever-present and popular Birmingham Brown, who brought comedy relief (and African American audiences) to the series. Monogram's Charlie Chan films were profitable and successful; they boasted tricky screenplays with many surprise culprits and murder devices, and frequent appearances by \"name\" character actors.\n\nBy the end of 1946, age and illness were affecting Toler. Diagnosed with cancer, the 72-year-old Toler was so ill during the filming of \"Dangerous Money\" (1946) and \"Shadows over Chinatown\" (1946) that he could hardly walk. Monogram hired Toler's original foil, \"Number Two Son\" Victor Sen Yung, for Toler's last three films, quite probably to ease the burden on Toler. Toler mustered enough strength to complete his last film, \"The Trap\", which was filmed in July–August 1946 and released in November that same year. (Yung and Moreland relieved Toler of much of the action in \"The Trap\"). Toler's Monogram output matched his Fox output: 11 films for each studio.\n\nOn August 29, 1906, Toler married actress Vivian Marston (born Josephine Gasper) of Boston, Massachusetts. She died in Hollywood on October 7, 1943, after an illness of seven months. Four weeks later, he married sculptor Vera Tattersall Orkow, a British-born actress credited as Viva Tattersall when she and Toler performed together and co-wrote the plays \"Dress Parade\" (1929) and \"Ritzy\" (1930). Their marriage lasted until Toler's death.\n\nSidney Toler died on February 12, 1947, at his home in Los Angeles from intestinal cancer. Monogram continued the Charlie Chan series with actor Roland Winters, who appeared in six Chan features.\n\n"}

Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan is one of the town attractions. The town has a number of colonial buildings and Chinese shophouses together with modern buildings, few shopping complexes and a modern cinema.\n\nThe town was founded on the river bank of the Perak River. The river forms an oxbow meander as it flows through the town, and the town is built around the oxbow. During high-tides, some parts of the town will be flooded with water even though there are watergates and banks to protect the town. Various measures taken by the government to solve the problem have seen relatively few floods in Teluk Intan nowadays. There has been speculation that the river's flow will erode the narrow neck of land in between the loops of the meander effectively turning Teluk Intan into an island.\n\nThe town is on Malaysia Federal Route 58 (Jalan Changkat Jong and Jalan Maharaja Lela), \nPerak State Route A151 (Jalan Sultan Abdullah) and \nPerak State Route A147 (Jalan Padang Tembak).\n\nThe area around Teluk Intan was originally populated by refugees from the Malacca Sultanate who were part of the entourage of the Raja Muzaffar Shah, the eldest son of the last Sultan of Melaka, Sultan Mahmud Shah. Upon fleeing the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511, a new kingdom was established on the banks of the Perak River near what is now Teluk Intan, and the court remained there until its relocation to Kuala Kangsar in the northern part of the state later in the 19th century.\n\nThis legacy can be seen in the choice of Teluk Intan as the location where the official residences of the Raja Muda (Crown Prince) and Raja di Hilir (4th in line of succession to the Perak throne) of Perak under the reign of Sultan Idris Shah. The town is one of four towns that play a role in Perak's complex ruler succession system. According to the system, a crown prince stayed at Teluk Intan Palace before entering the next stage of becoming Raja Bendahara (Prime Prince). Only after becoming Raja Bendahara will he proceed to be Raja Muda (Crown Prince) and then Sultan of Perak.\n\nThis succession system was changed by the former Sultan, Almarhum Sultan Azlan Shah just before he was appointed the Yang Dipertuan Agong. His son was the then Raja Muda (now the Sultan of Perak) and did not live in Teluk Intan. The former palace is located just outside the town, and has fallen into disrepair.\n\nThe town of Teluk Intan developed around a few small villages in the location, such as Durian Sebatang, Pasir Bedamar, and Batak Rabit. A plan to build a township linking the few villages was drawn up by Sir Archibald Anson during the late 19th century, and the township was named after him in 1882. Teluk Intan developed into a port, and many agricultural products and tin were exported from it. The fourth railway track in Malaya was built connecting Tapah and Teluk Intan, showing the port town's importance during the British protectorate age.\n\nTeluk Intan was also home to the meeting between Raja Abdullah, Dato' Maharajalela and other Malay chieftains who plotted to kill J. W. W. Birch, the first British Resident of Perak. The meeting was held in Durian Sebatang. Birch was later killed in Pasir Salak while bathing in the river.\n\nThe last major engagement during the Malayan Emergency was fought in the marshes near Teluk Intan in 1958, and ended with the surrender of the local Malayan Races Liberation Army forces to government forces.\n\nBy the early 1980s the town was the third largest town in Perak. Teluk Intan served as the major administrative and business settlement for smaller neighbouring towns such as Tapah, Bidor, Bagan Datoh and Hutan Melintang. Until the mid-1990s Sabak Bernam, a town in the neighbouring state of Selangor, also dependeded on Teluk Intan for most of their basic services. Even their telephone area code was registered using Perak's area code of +605 instead of +603 that is used in Selangor. Acute medical cases would be transferred to Teluk Intan Hospital as their hospital did not have the equipment or expertise.\n\nAs the Perak River became shallower each year due to upstream erosion and silt deposition near Teluk Intan, the town lost its two most important roles in Perak's economy which was being an export harbour for tin and rubber and as a petroleum distribution centre for Shell Malaysia. This is because big oil tankers and cargo ships were no longer able to sail into the town's port. By the end of the 1980s, Shell Malaysia transferred their petroleum storing facilities to the coastal town of Lumut in Manjung, located 60 km from Teluk Intan. As the economic activity declined, it also lost its railway facilities which connected the town with Tapah and the national railway network.\n\nDuring the 1990s, economic activities in Teluk Intan continued to decline. This situation forced the younger generation to migrate to bigger cities such as Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Shah Alam in search of better jobs. Ironically this caused the town to suffer a shortage in labour supply especially in the agriculture sector, resulting in an increase of migrant workers from Indonesia and Bangladesh.\n\nWith the development of a new town centre along with the completion of new coastal highway from Klang to Sabak Bernam in late 1999, Teluk Intan began to enjoy a resurgence in its economic activity. In April 2004, the town was made the fourth municipality (having upgraded to Municipal Council status, or Majlis Perbandaran) in Perak after Ipoh, Taiping and Manjung.\n\nThe main economic activities in Teluk Intan are oil palm cultivation and palm oil production. Many plantations around Teluk Intan are owned by big corporations such as Sime Darby and United Plantations (UP).\n\nThere are some other industries in Teluk Intan including shipbuilding and the textile industry. Shopping centres, modern cinema, shops, and educational institutions also bring many people to Teluk Intan weekly.\n\nAs it is the major town in Hilir Perak, Teluk Intan's shopping centres attract shoppers from nearby smaller townships and the surrounding area. They include:\n\n\nThe main healthcare centres in Teluk Intan town are:\n\nOne of the town attractions is a Leaning Tower erected in 1885 by a Chinese builder, Mr. Leong Choon Cheong. It started to tilt four years after its construction finished due to an underground stream. The tower was originally used as a water tower supplying the area of the town. It had a clock at the top, which still rings every 15 minutes. The tower also served as a beacon to guide ships into Teluk Intan Port. The tower came close to being demolished when a decision by the then Lower Perak Sanitary Board passed a resolution to have it demolished in July 1941 due to the impending air raids. However, another board meeting in September of 1941 reversed that decision and the tower remains standing. Currently it is a local tourist attraction, and no longer stores water. The tower is also recognised as a National Heritage through joint efforts by the National Heritage Department, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Perak State government and Teluk Intan Municipal Council. The area around the tower was paved with bricks and became a plaza. The main street at the centre of Teluk Intan, Jalan Ah Cheong, is named after Leong Choon Cheong to commemorate his contribution.\n\nGPS Coordinates: 4°1.544′N, 101°1.133′E\n\nAnother attraction is the 'Batu Tenggek' (Sitting Boulder) which is situated at a junction in the town centre. There is a local legend that the rock was placed there by a British soldier, and was originally the size of a matchbox but grew bigger over the years however this is not the truth. The boulder was placed in the compound of the Lower Perak Club in an angle formed by Dew Road and Batak Rabit Road, and the giant granite boulder was placed on a dressed based made of solid stone. The memorial commemorating the fallen of World war I & II was officiated by Sir Theodore Fraser, General Commanding Officer of the Malaya Command of the British empire during his tenure between 1924 and 1927. Carved on the dressed stone is a line taken from Laurence Binyon's famous poem, \"For the Fallen\": \n\nThis palace was once the official residence of The Raja Muda of Perak. After the demise of the Raja Muda, the palace was neglected, and drug addicts used and stripped the building. Some people believe the remains of the palace to be haunted. It is illegal to enter the grounds without permission, because it is the property of the Sultan of Perak. The ruin is located next to the mansion of Dato. Mah, near Jalan Sekolah.\n\nThere is also a famous temple complex in Teluk Intan, known as Hock Soon Keong (Hock Soon Temple) dedicated to Seng Gong. The origins of the temple are unknown, while the main temple building (not the original one) was constructed in 1883, as indicated by a legend painted on the building. Hock Soon Temple was the centrepoint of all Hokkien Chinese in Teluk Intan during the British colonial era. The local Hokkien people would congregate at the temple to solve all problems, from giving aid to the poor to solving fights between clans. The local Hokkien people used to select three local Hokkiens, usually businessmen and famous men to settle their problems. The temple was built with Southern Chinese architecture, the most notable feature being the elaborately decorated upturned eaves. There is also a century old mosque just opposite the temple, which is frequently mentioned as a typical depiction of religious harmony in Malaysia.\n\nThe temple is popularly called 'Perak Thendayuthapani Temple', and also as Malaysia's Palani Andavar. Construction of the temple began in 1926. Financial support was provided by the Nattukottai Chettiars (also known as the Nagarathars), a prominent mercantile community with origins in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nThe most prominent festival held at this temple is the Chitra Pournami during the Tamil month of Chithrai (April–May). The Chitra Pournami festival lasts three days. On the third day of the festival (the day of Pournami, full moon), the Silver Chariot (Velli Ratham) is taken in procession. This velli ratham was brought to the temple in the year 1932. The procession's route usually covers the entire old town of Teluk Intan.\n\nThe temple is managed by the Nagarathars of seven towns including Teluk Intan, Tapah, Kampar, Bidor, SitiawanPantai remis and Lumut. Now there is no representation from Bidor and Pantai remis. They make donations annually at festival time. The day-to-day management of the temple is entrusted to three Nagarathar families, who hold office in 57, 59 and 61, Jalan Bandar.\n\nThis temple is one of eighteen constructed by the Nattukottai Chettiars in Malaysia.\n\nAlthough Sungai Kerawai Halt was one of the stops before the town of Teluk Anson, it was also here at this stop that the first railway crash of Malaya happened. While the much documented train derailment happened in 1894 along the Tapah Teluk Anson Railway line. As a result of the derailment, the night mail train which came into contact with a Bull elephant was damaged, while the Bull which was thought to have stood its ground defending its herd lay dead. A memorial sign was erected by the then railway authority.\n\nThere are two public university branch campuses located in Teluk Intan. The campuses are Universiti Teknologi Mara Teluk Intan Campus for Faculty of Medicine UiTM completed in October 2010 and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Teluk Intan Campus of Faculty of Medicine UKM. Both are located beside Teluk Intan Hospital.\n\nOther higher education is currently provided by the Teluk Intan Community College (established 2001) and the Teluk Intan Hospital is used as a teaching hospital by the Universiti Kuala Lumpur Royal College of Medicine Perak.\n\nBeing one of the principal towns in the Hilir Perak, Teluk Intan has over 100 primary schools and more than 20 secondary schools. Schools in established prior to the Independence of Malaya in 1957 include:\n\nThere is one boarding school in Teluk Intan that is Sekolah Menengah Sains Teluk Intan and one technical school, Sekolah Menengah Teknik Teluk Intan.\n\nMany Malay delicacies can be found in Teluk Intan. These include 'mee rebus' Mastan Ghani, a boiled noodle dish served with a moderately spicy and sweet gravy; a more spicy noodle dish called Mee Jawa; nasi kandar, satay, and fruit rojak.\n\nAnother attraction is a beverage made of rose syrup mixed with coconut milk or milk called 'Ais Bandung'. This beverage can be found near the wet market, located on the northern riverbank.\n\nThe local Chinese community has a number of delicacies as well. One of them is 'Heong Peah' (\"Fragrant Biscuit\"). Heong Peah has a crispy pastry layer outside and a sticky filling inside (also known as beleko). It contains a mixture of flour, oil, maltose, sugar, sesame, and shallots. The 'Heong Peah' market in Teluk Intan is dominated by two family-run enterprises: Sin Guan Tin and Sin Joo Heong. Locals fondly refer to the latter as the 'Tiger' brand or mark or 'Tiger Biscuit'. The former's trademark is a butterfly.\n\nAnother delicacy in Teluk Intan is the 'Chee Cheong Fun', a variation of Kueh Teow containing turnip, whereas the Hong Kong Chee Cheong Fun has prawns wrapped inside.\n\nChinese curry mee and a variety of other food can be found at \"Glutton Square\" located at the corner of Jalan Sithabaram Pillai and Jalan Ah Cheong.\nThere is also a food court (locals call it \"Bumbung Biru\") in front of Menara Jam Condong \"The Leaning Tower\".\n\nAnother long-standing tourist sight for more than 25 years is Teluk Intan's laksa sold from a bicycle by \"Uncle Laksa\". This man rides around the town areas such as Jln Woo Saik Hong, Jln Pasir Bedamar, Jln Ah Cheong and Jln Pasar to sell his trademark laksa, cooked on his custom-made 3-wheeler bicycle.\nOther types of foods found in Teluk Intan include western-style fast food restaurants and Japanese sushi.\n\n\n"}

In the United States, these posters are also commonly referred to as wheatpaste posters because wheatpaste is often used to adhere the posters. Posters are adhered to construction site barricades, building façades and in alleyways.\n\nThe posters used are typically made of a lightweight paper and printed using flexography, digital printing and screen printing. Modern printing techniques enable the posters to feature full-colour designs, halftones, and photographs, making them popular for advertising concerts, political messages, commercial advertisements and special events. An increasing number of posters do not advertise anything at all and instead feature artwork, inspirational or positive messages, and religious messages.\n\nIt is an advertising tactic mostly used by small businesses promoting concerts and political activist groups, but there have been occasions where international companies subcontracted local advertising agencies for flyposting jobs in order not to get caught in illegal behavior, as a form of guerrilla marketing. In 2004, Sony Music and BMG were threatened with anti-social behaviour orders by Camden Borough Council for illegal flyposting.\n\nIn many countries, it is illegal to place such posters on private property without the consent of the property owner, or to post on public property without a sign permit from the local government. Some areas, however, have public bulletin boards where notices may be posted.\n\nIn an effort to discourage illegal flyposting, surfaces at risk of it are sometimes permanently signed Post No Bills (USA), No Flyposting (UK), or in France Défense d'afficher - loi du 29 juillet 1881, referring to a law.\n\nWhile flyposting is commonplace, it is often viewed as a nuisance by landlords and they can take civil action to protect their property rights. A particularly noteworthy incident of this type occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. In the case of the 2007 Boston Mooninite Scare, advertisers had placed electronic signboards without notifying local authorities, prompting a costly reaction by the Boston Police Bomb Squad when the signs were mistaken for bombs.\n\nWith the rise of the world wide web, much of advertising has been shifted online. Some advertising agencies have drawn similarities between flyposting and certain types of adware, which are more invasive to consumers.\n\n"}

It is the capital of Kinta District.Upgrade In 2020 Of Batu Gajah Municipal Council\n\nThe name \"Batu Gajah\" ('batu' is stone and 'gajah' is elephant in the Malay language), is presumably derived from two large boulders that resembled elephants found along the Kinta River. Folklore claims that huge elephant figures were made of stones to scare away the elephants that destroyed the villagers' sugar cane crops.\n\nFamous for its tin mining long before the Independence Day of Malaya, Batu Gajah had been an ideal place for Chinese immigrants to stay and work during those years. This contributes to a significant percentage of Chinese in the population of Batu Gajah today. The Indian Settlement village at Changkat has a large Indian population of Tamils and also Punjabis who built one of the oldest Sikh temples in Perak.\n\nBatu Gajah had an established pre-war British English school, which was renamed Sultan Yussuf School (SYS) after the war. The Sultan of Perak DYMM Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Yussuf Izzuddin Shah Ghafarullahu-lah is an alumnus of this school. Formerly known as the Government English School (GES), it was founded by Mr. Malai Perumal Pillay in 1907. The school was built from the rubble of an old jail. Over the years, it has produced many successful students.\n\nBatu Gajah since lies on the bank of Sungai Kinta, a little downstream from the major confluence of Sungai Raya. It started out as one of the many villages of mukim Sungai Terap, developed under its titular chief, the Sri Amar DiRaja, the early 19th century.\n\nThe attractions here include two golf courses, Kinta Golf Club and Clearwater Sanctuary Golf Course, and nearby pre-independence castle built by a Scottish rubber plantation owner, Sir William Kellie Smith: Kellie's Castle.\n\nThere are many hawker stalls and restaurants serving food such as noodles, laksa, and Indian-Muslim mee goreng and mee rebus. Youths spend time at cybercafés and around the local supermarket. In recent years, Western style food franchises such as 7-Eleven, KFC, Marry Brown, OldTown White Coffee and Pizza Hut opened branches in the town. A supermarket named TF has opened and is in business.\n\nIn recent years, Batu Gajah has seen a lot of improvement. \nIn September 2012, Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co. Ltd., one of the major electric locomotive manufacturers in China, agreed to build a rolling-stock factory in Batu Gajah.\n\nIn 2007, Batu Gajah received a new Batu Gajah railway station. Near Kampung Pisang at the southern end of town, it replaced the old station at Jalan Pusing which is being turned into a museum and then foodstalls.\n\nIn addition, the Malaysian railroad operator, Keretapi Tanah Melayu, is constructing a new central workshop in the vicinity of Batu Gajah to replace its facility in Sentul. Located near the new railway station, the centre will house repair workshops, training facilities and staff quarters. The center was scheduled for completion in August 2009 at a projected cost of RM 430 million.\n\nA new four-lane highway connects to the Ipoh-Lumut Highway at Seputeh and ties to the North–South Expressway at Gopeng. The highway passes near the new railway station through Bemban at the West side of town.\n\n\n\n\nSome heritage buildings and landmarks in Batu Gajah that are famous throughout Perak:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2067567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067567", "title": "Collateral contract", "text": "Collateral contract\n\nA collateral contract is usually a single term contract, made in consideration of the party for whose benefit the contract operates agreeing to enter into the principal or main contract, which sets out additional terms relating to the same subject matter as the main contract. The collateral contract co-exists side by side. For example, a collateral contract is formed when one party pays the other party a certain sum for entry into another contract. A collateral contract may be between one of the parties and a third party.\n\nIt can also be epitomized as follows: a collateral contract is one that induces a person to enter into a separate \"primary\" contract. For example, if X agrees to buy goods from Y that will, accordingly, be manufactured by Z, and does so on the strength of Z's assurance as to the high quality of the goods, X and Z may be held to have made a collateral contract consisting of Z's promise of quality given in consideration of X's promise to enter into the main contract with Y.\n\nA party to an existing contract may attempt to show that a collateral contract exists if their claim for a breach of contract fails because the statement they relied upon was not held to be a term of the main contract. It has been held that for this to be successful, the statement must have been promissory in nature. Remedies may be awarded for breach of a collateral contract.\n\nA collateral contract is one where the parties to one contract enter into or promise to enter into another contract. Thus, the two contracts are connected and it may be enforced even though it forms no constructive part of the original contract. In \"JJ Savage and Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney\" a mere expression of opinion was held insufficient to be satisfied as a promise. In \"Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd\" a statement by a landlord made to intending tenants when negotiating a lease that they would be “looked after at renewal time”, would not bind the landlord to offer a further five year lease.\n\nThe promisor must have expressly or impliedly requested about the main contract and his promissory statement must have intended to induce the entry of the other party into the main contract. According to Lord Denning MR, a collateral contract is held binding \"when a person gives a promise, or an assurance to another, intending that he should act on it by entering into a contract'.\n\nA collateral contract, if forged between the same parties as the main contract, must not contradict the main contract. That is, if the term was agreed upon prior to the completion of the formal contract (but was still included as a term, and could not be executed until completion of the second term), the first term will still be allowed. Essentially the collateral contracts cannot contradict any element of the main contract nor the rights created by it.\n\nA theory sustains that is feasible to typify letter of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application of the theory of Jean Domat the cause of a letter of credit is that a bank issue a credit in favor of a seller to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller with legal tender. There are in fact three different entities participating in the letter of credit transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Therefore, a letter of credit theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct, or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nCollateral contracts are an exception to the privity of contract doctrine, which provides that a contract cannot impose obligations or confer rights on a non-contracting party. However, in circumstances where a collateral contract is established between a third party and one of the contracting parties, the Court may allow rights or impose obligations on the non-contracting party, as illustrated in the earlier tortious case of \"Donoghue v Stevenson\".\n\nCommon law recognises collateral contract as an exception to parol evidence rule, meaning that admissible evidence of a collateral contract can be used to exclude the operation of the parol evidence rule. Practically, it is rare to find collateral contract as an exception as it must be strictly proved; and the burden of proof is only eased if the subject matter with which the main contract deals is more unusual.\n\nIn the English case of \"Barry v Davies\", it was held that an auctioneer and a buyer had formed a collateral contract. It was held that even though the main contract does not involve the auctioneer, benefits given to the auctioneer for increasing the price of a bid constitutes a good consideration.\n\nIn \"Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer\", a landlord has promised orally not to exercise the right to termination in the principal contract if tenant signed the contract; landlord ended up terminating the main contract, whereas tenant's appeal was dismissed by the Court.\n"}

Polynomials with this property are called Hurwitz stable polynomials. The Routh-Hurwitz theorem is important in dynamical systems and control theory, because the characteristic polynomial of the differential equations of a stable linear system has roots limited to the left half plane. Thus the theorem provides a test for whether a linear dynamical system is stable. The Routh–Hurwitz theorem was proved in 1895, and it was named after Edward John Routh and Adolf Hurwitz.\n\nLet \"f\"(\"z\") be a polynomial (with complex coefficients) of degree \"n\" with no roots on the imaginary line (i.e. the line \"Z\" = \"ic\" where \"i\" is the imaginary unit and \"c\" is a real number). Let us define formula_1 (a polynomial of degree \"n\") and formula_2 (a nonzero polynomial of degree strictly less than \"n\") by formula_3, respectively the real and imaginary parts of \"f\" on the imaginary line.\n\nFurthermore, let us denote by:\n\nWith the notations introduced above, the Routh–Hurwitz theorem states that:\n\nFrom the first equality we can for instance conclude that when the variation of the argument of \"f\"(\"iy\") is positive, then \"f\"(\"z\") will have more roots to the left of the imaginary axis than to its right.\nThe equality \"p\" − \"q\" = \"w\"(+∞) − \"w\"(−∞) can be viewed as the complex counterpart of Sturm's theorem. Note the differences: in Sturm's theorem, the left member is \"p\" + \"q\" and the \"w\" from the right member is the number of variations of a Sturm chain (while \"w\" refers to a generalized Sturm chain in the present theorem).\n\nWe can easily determine a stability criterion using this theorem as it is trivial that \"f\"(\"z\") is Hurwitz-stable iff \"p\" − \"q\" = \"n\". We thus obtain conditions on the coefficients of \"f\"(\"z\") by imposing \"w\"(+∞) = \"n\" and \"w\"(−∞) = 0.\n\n\n"}

It is depicted as the crucial mobile command center, forward operations platform, and signature capital ship of the fictional intelligence/defense agency S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nOriginally designed by Jack Kirby for the \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" serial in \"Strange Tales\" #135 (August 1965), the Helicarrier concept has survived multiple redesigns while rarely straying from its originally depicted role as a mobile headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. until recent years.\n\nIn the Marvel Universe context of the various Nick Fury/S.H.I.E.L.D. series, the original design is attributed to a co-operative effort by Tony Stark, the mutant inventor Forge, and Reed Richards. According to one account in \"Amazing Fantasy\" vol. 2, #10, the first Helicarrier was proposed by Stark Industries as a political compromise among the signatories of the treaty in response to fears that any nation hosting the Directorate's main headquarters would be subject to attack by organizations such as HYDRA, with domestic political fallout sure to follow immediately thereafter.\n\nOver twenty Helicarriers have been built over the decades, and at least two have been in simultaneous service in the last decade on several occasions. The following have been identified by name thus far in various Marvel Universe publications:\n\n\nAfter Iron Man replaced Maria Hill as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., he designed a new class of Helicarrier whose red and gold design resembles the Iron Man Armor. Hill called it \"Helicarrier Gold\", but Stark considered it \"The\" Helicarrier. This helicarrier was severely damaged and crashed by the Red Hulk, and subsequently commandeered by the Intelligencia (the covert operation of evil super-geniuses that employed the Red Hulk), who renamed it the \"Hellcarrier\".\n\nThe main S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier is subsequently disabled by a computer virus unleashed by a Skrull agent posing as Edwin Jarvis, as part of the Secret Invasion. It lands in the Bermuda Triangle. Most of the staff are revealed to be Skrulls. The craft is destroyed by Maria Hill.\n\nIt is not yet known what criteria S.H.I.E.L.D. uses to name its Helicarriers.\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D.'s replacement agency, H.A.M.M.E.R., has decommissioned the surviving Helicarriers, with three of them — including the \"Iliad\" and the \"Argonaut\" — being stolen by Nick Fury. H.A.M.M.E.R. subsequently commissioned at least one new carrier to Norman Osborn's specifications, which was destroyed over Broxton, Oklahoma, during the Siege of Asgard.\n\nAccording to intel gathered by Livewires, 5 Helicarriers are known to have been wrecked, though this data is out of date as several more have been lost since.\n\nIn the pages of \"Avengers Undercover\", it is shown that the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier Circe has employed some necromancers as part of its personnel as seen when they jam Nico Minoru's spells.\n\nIn the epilogue of issue #25 of \"New Avengers\", circa the year 1968, Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man), is seen giving Colonel Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. the hard sell of his newly designed Hellicarrier.\n\nThe Ultimate Universe deals with Helicarriers differently. Whereas on Marvel's Earth-616 is implied that S.H.I.E.L.D. (a United Nations Task Force) only has a handful of Helicarriers in operation, in the Ultimate Universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is depicted as a United States-operated military organization and is shown to have dozens of carriers, some even replacing retired conventional aircraft carriers like the USS \"Constellation\". The engines that keep the carrier aloft were designed by Tony Stark and were modular enough to be used in a space shuttle by the Ultimate Fantastic Four. These \"Ultimate Universe\" Helicarriers generally seem to be smaller than the Earth-616 versions, and have a more conventional aircraft carrier shape, but are far more plentiful.

It was supposed to be modelled on the popular pre-Soviet literary magazine \"Mir Bozhy\" (\"God's World\"), which was published from 1892 to 1906, and its follow-up, \"Sovremenny Mir\" (\"Contemporary World\"), which was published from 1906 to 1917. \"Novy Mir\" mainly published prose that approved of the general line of the Communist Party.\n\nIn the early 1960s, \"Novy Mir\" changed its political stance, leaning to a dissident position. In November 1962 the magazine became famous for publishing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's groundbreaking \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\", a novella about a prisoner of the Gulag. In the same year its circulation was about 150,000 copies per a month. The magazine continued publishing controversial articles and stories about various aspects of Soviet and Russian history despite the fact that its editor-in-chief, Alexander Tvardovsky, facing significant political pressure, resigned in February 1970. With the appointment of Sergey Zalygin in 1986, at the beginning of \"perestroika\", the magazine practised increasingly bold criticism of the Soviet Government, including figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev. It also published fiction and poetry by previously banned writers, such as George Orwell, Joseph Brodsky and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\n\nToday \"Novy Mir\" is considered a leading Russian literary magazine and has a liberal orientation.\n\nIn the 2000s, the following authors have been published: Maxim Amelin, Arkadi Babchenko, Dmitry Bak, Vladimir Berezin, Dmitry Bykov, Dmitry Danilov, Vladimir Gandelsman, Alisa Ganieva, Alexander Ilichevsky, Alexander Karasyov, Leonid Kostyukov, Yuri Kublanovsky, Alexander Kushner, Yulia Latynina, Vladimir Makanin, Anatoly Nayman, Yevgeni Popov, Zakhar Prilepin, Valery Pustovaya, Sergey Soloukh, Andrei Volos, Oleg Yermakov and others.\n\n\n"}

The mall is managed by Lendlease.\n\nParkway Parade was developed by Parkway Holdings and was completed in December 1983. At that time of completion, it was one of the first suburban shopping malls in Singapore. It featured many major tenants setting up their stores in the suburbs for the first time, such as Isetan, Marks and Spencer, Yaohan Best, children's department store Small World and MPH Bookstores. It also featured a wide array of food choices, including Chuck'E'Cheese, Hardees', and Petite Park. The mall also had an amusement centre occupying Levels 3 and 4 (Funland) and a playground at Level 7, which was the largest mall playground in Singapore at that time.\n\nIn 2000, the property was sold to Asia Pacific Insurance Company, and subsequently Lendlease was appointed to manage the mall.\n\nThe mall commenced its first makeover in March 2002 and was completed in two phases. The first phase included a new tenant mix, to reflect the positioning of the mall. This included anchor tenant, Giant, occupying nearly half of the third floor. The mall's second phase was completed in November 2003, with a brand-new and expanded food court at the Basement floor and an alfresco-dining area on the first floor. It also included the completion of the 'Waterfall' leisure and dining precinct with one of the country's tallest glass waterfall, a water play area, six food and beverage outdoor kiosks and a restaurant. The mall was fully renovated in November 2003.\n\nFurther facelifts were done to mall's exterior featuring an expanded alfresco-dining to the first floor. in 2011, with the removal of the 'Waterfall' leisure feature and repositioning of the entrance area.

{"id": "2067647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067647", "title": "El Farol Bar problem", "text": "El Farol Bar problem\n\nThe El Farol bar problem is a problem in game theory. Every Thursday night, a fixed population want to go have fun at the El Farol Bar, unless it's too crowded.\n\n\nEveryone must decide \"at the same time\" whether to go or not, with no knowledge of others' choices.\n\nParadoxically, if everyone uses a deterministic pure strategy which is symmetric (same strategy for all players), it is guaranteed to fail no matter what it is. If the strategy suggests it will not be crowded, everyone will go, and thus it \"will\" be crowded; but if the strategy suggests it will be crowded, nobody will go, and thus it will \"not\" be crowded, but again no one will have fun. Better success is possible with a probablistic mixed strategy. For the single-stage El Farol Bar problem, there exists a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium mixed strategy where all players choose to go to the bar with a certain probability, determined according to the number of players, the threshold for crowdedness, and the relative utility of going to a crowded or uncrowded bar compared to staying home. There are also multiple Nash equilibria in which one or more players use a pure strategy, but these equilibria are not symmetric. Several variants are considered in \"Game Theory Evolving\" by Herbert Gintis.\n\nIn some variants of the problem, the players are allowed to communicate before deciding to go to the bar. However, they are not required to tell the truth.\n\nBased on a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the problem was created in 1994 by W. Brian Arthur. However, under another name, the problem was formulated and solved dynamically six years earlier by B. A. Huberman and T. Hogg.\n\nA variant is the Minority Game proposed by Yi-Cheng Zhang and Damien Challet from the University of Fribourg. An odd number of players each must make a binary choice independently at each turn, and the winners are those players who end up on the minority side. As in the El Farol Bar problem, no single (symmetric) deterministic strategy can give an equilibrium, but for mixed strategies there is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium (each player chooses with 50% probability), as well as multiple non-symmetric equilibria.\n\nA multi-stage, cooperative Minority Game was featured in the manga \"Liar Game\", in which the majority was repeatedly eliminated until only one player was left. \n\nAnother variant of the El Farol Bar problem is the Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem, named for the many cheap restaurants where laborers can grab a quick lunch, but may have to return to work hungry if their chosen restaurant is too crowded. Formally, a large number \"N\" of players each choose one of a large number \"n\" of restaurants, typically \"N\" = \"n\" (while in the El Farol Bar Problem, \"n\" = 2, including the stay-home option). At each restaurant, one customer at random is served lunch (payoff = 1) while all others lose (payoff = 0). The players do not know each others' choices on a given day, but the game is repeated daily, and the history of all players' choices is available to everyone. Optimally, each player chooses a different restaurant, but this is practically impossible without coordination, resulting in both hungry customers and unattended restaurants wasting capacity.\n\nStrategies are evaluated based on their aggregate payoff and/or the proportion of attended restaurants (utilization ratio). A leading stochastic strategy, with utilization ~0.79, gives each customer a probability \"p\" of choosing the same restaurant as yesterday (\"p\" varying inversely with the number of players who chose that restaurant yesterday), while choosing among other restaurants with uniform probability. This is a better result than deterministic algorithms or simple random choice (noise trader), with utilization fraction 1 - /\"\" ≈ 0.63.\n\nIn a similar problem, there are hospital beds in every locality, but patients are tempted to go to prestigious hospitals out of their district. However, if too many patients go to a prestige hospital, some get no hospital bed at all, while additionally wasting the unused beds at their local hospitals.\n\n"}

Though a contemporary artist, her work showed a strong influence from folk art. She was considered a central figure in the Bay Area Mission School art movement.\n\nKilgallen was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up nearby in Kensington, Maryland. Because of her exposure to bluegrass music as a child, Kilgallen became an accomplished banjo player. She received a BFA in studio art and printmaking from Colorado College in 1989. After moving to San Francisco, she took up surfing and in 1990 met her future husband Barry McGee, who was also a surfer. After her time at Colorado College, Kilgallen had a few solo exhibitions in New York and California during 1997 through 1999. She also received a MFA from Stanford University in 2001.\n\nThough she was diagnosed with breast cancer in late July 2001, Kilgallen opted to forgo chemotherapy so that she might carry a pregnancy to term. During this time she continued to work on art that would later be displayed in galleries after her death. She died in 2001, at age 33, three weeks after the birth of Asha, her daughter with her husband and collaborator Barry McGee. Kilgallen has since been the subject of several posthumous retrospectives.\n\nKilgallen's first major group exhibitions appeared in 1997 and included the first Bay Area Now show at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. This was followed by a solo exhibition, \"Three Sheets to the Wind\", at The Drawing Center in New York City in 1997. In 1998, Kilgallen had another solo exhibition, Sincere Sin, at the John Berggruen Gallery in San Francisco, CA. Following that exhibition, Kilgallen had two more solo exhibitions before her death in 2001. These two galleries were her 1999 To Friend and Foe, Deitch Projects, in New York, NY, and in 2000 her solo exhibition Hammer Projects: Margaret Kilgallen, in the UCLA Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA. A number of major exhibitions took place after her death. In 2002, her work was chosen for that year's Whitney Biennial. In 2005, a survey of her work titled, In the Sweet Bye & Bye,was shown at the Gallery at REDCAT. Her work was also an important part of the 2004–2006 touring exhibit, \"Beautiful Losers: Contemporary Art and Street Culture.\" In 2011, Kilgallen's Summer Selections exhibit was shown in the Ratio 3 gallery in San Francisco, CA. Through Jan 12-Jun 16, 2019, the Aspen Art Museum is showing Margaret Kilgallen: That's Where the Beauty is, a survey of her work from 1997 to 2001.\n\nOther galleries that have exhibited her work include the Luggage Store in San Francisco; Gallery 16 in San Francisco; Forum for Contemporary Art in St. Louis; the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia; and The Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.\n\nKilgallen's paintings and murals reflect a variety of influences, including hand-painted signs, elements of American folk art, mural painting, and a variety of formal painting strategies. At an early age, she was impressed by examples of works by Southwestern and Mexican artists, and she employed these artists' use of warm colors in her own painting. Her many works in gouache, acrylic, and randomly-mixed and recycled house paints on found paper (often discarded book endpapers), reflect an interest in typographic styles and symbology that can be traced to her work as a book conservator with Dan Flanagan at the San Francisco Public Library in the early to mid-1990s. Kilgallen rendered all her work by hand without preparatory drawings or masking tape in order to express the handmade quality of each piece. Her paintings showcase women engaging in a variety of everyday activities that include biking and surfing. In addition to her commissioned mural work, Kilgallen was also a graffiti artist under the tag names \"Meta\" and \"Matokie Slaughter.\" The latter name, an homage to folk musician Matokie Slaughter, was specifically used for freight train graffiti.\n\nKilgallen was an avid reader, looking to Appalachian music, signage, letterpress printing, freight train graffiti art, and religious and decorative arts to inform her work. Her work demonstrates her respect for and engagement with craftsmanship and the stories of everyday peoples' lives.\n\n\n"}

His church began holding rituals there and their worship was permitted to continue when the site was given to the state in 1918.\n\nAlthough only commanding around 50 adherents in its early days, the Church was instrumental in forming the link in the popular imagination between Stonehenge and Druids - despite the efforts of archaeologists to discourage the connection.\n\nIn 1924 the Office of Works permitted the Church to scatter the ashes of cremated former members at Stonehenge, something which drew significant protests from the Society of Antiquaries, the Wiltshire Archaeological Society, the Royal Archaeological Institute and famous archaeologists such as O. G. S. Crawford. The outcry persuaded the government to withdraw permission and in 1932 the Church officially moved its rites from the monument to Normanton Gorse nearby.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Reid's son Robert took over leadership of the Church and it was able to regain midsummer access to Stonehenge throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s, to the dismay of many leading archaeologists.\n\nWhen the growing Stonehenge free festival caused the monument to be closed at midsummer in 1985, the Church faded into obscurity, but has maintained a presence at the re-opened solstice festivities since 2000.\n\n"}

{"id": "2067724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067724", "title": "Petr Sýkora", "text": "Petr Sýkora\n\nPetr Sýkora (; born November 19, 1976) is a Czech retired professional ice hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, New York Rangers, Edmonton Oilers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Minnesota Wild. He is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, having won with the Devils in 2000 and the Penguins in 2009. Sýkora has played in six Stanley Cup Finals in his NHL career.\n\nBefore being drafted, Sýkora spent several seasons in the Czechoslovak Extraliga and the International Hockey League (IHL). As a Cleveland Lumberjack, Sýkora became the youngest player ever to play in the IHL at 17 years and 71 days. He has also played for the IHL's Detroit Vipers.\n\nIn the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, Sýkora was drafted in the first round, 18th overall, by the New Jersey Devils. He began his NHL career in 1995–96 with New Jersey, posting 42 points in his rookie campaign, as well as being chosen as the NHL Rookie of the Month for December. His career took off in his fourth NHL season, recording a breakout 72 points, which still stands as the second highest total of his career. As part of the Devils' effective \"A-line,\" with Patrik Eliáš and Jason Arnott, he helped lead the team to a Stanley Cup in 2000 against the Dallas Stars. However, in the sixth and deciding game in Dallas, Sýkora suffered an injury and ended up in the hospital. When the Devils won the game to win the Stanley Cup, Devils Head Coach Larry Robinson and linemate Patrik Eliáš wore Sýkora's jersey for him. The team also brought the trophy to Sýkora in the hospital. The next season, Sýkora and the Devils were only a game away from repeating as Stanley Cup champions, but lost in the seventh game to the Colorado Avalanche. That year, Sýkora recorded career highs with 35 goals, 46 assists and 81 points.\n\nHowever, the next season, Sýkora's offensive production dropped to just 48 points, and the before the start of the 2002–03 season, he was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for forward Jeff Friesen and defenceman Oleg Tverdovsky. In his first season with Anaheim, Sýkora appeared in his third Stanley Cup Final, but lost to his former Devils teammates. En route to the finals, he scored the game-winning, quintuple-overtime goal in the fourth-longest playoff game in NHL history in Game 1 of the Western Conference Semi-finals against the Dallas Stars.\n\nWhile the 2004–05 NHL lockout was in effect, Sýkora played for Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the Russian Superleague (RSL), scoring 31 points in 45 games. As NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Sýkora requested to be traded from Anaheim and on January 9, 2006, the New York Rangers acquired Sýkora in exchange for young defenceman Maxim Kondratiev and the return of a fourth-round draft pick the Rangers had previously traded to Anaheim.\n\nAfter completing the season with New York, it was announced on July 7, 2006, that Sýkora would not return to the Rangers, and he was subsequently signed to a one-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers. On a line with countryman Aleš Hemský, Sýkora maintained the previous few seasons' scoring output and managed 53 points.\n\nIn July 2007, Sýkora signed a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins as an unrestricted free agent. After initially playing with Sidney Crosby, Sýkora was later lined up with Evgeni Malkin after Crosby suffered an injury towards the end of the season. Benefiting from his high-caliber linemates, Sýkora enjoyed his best offensive season since 2000–01, tallying 63 points.\n\nReaching the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, Sýkora scored a triple-overtime goal on the powerplay in Game 5 after previously telling on-ice reporter Pierre McGuire he would score the game-winner. With the Penguins down 3–1 in the series, Sýkora's goal forced a Game 6. However, the Penguins could not stave off elimination for a second straight game and lost the Cup to Detroit. The series marked Sýkora's fourth time playing in a Stanley Cup Final.\n\nThe following season, on December 11, 2008, Sýkora scored his eighth, ninth and tenth goals of the season for his first career NHL hat-trick against the New York Islanders at Mellon Arena. Sýkora had previously recorded 38 career two-goal games in his career, the all-time NHL record for most two-goal games without a single hat-trick. Later that season, on April 7, 2009, Sýkora scored his 300th career NHL goal in a 6–4 victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning. In early May 2009, Sýkora began struggling with a shoulder injury. He finished his second season in Pittsburgh with 25 goals and 46 points over 76 games. Bolstering their lineup at the trade deadline, the Penguins acquired wingers Bill Guerin and Chris Kunitz, resulting in decreased ice time for Sýkora. During the 2009 playoffs, he was regularly made a healthy scratch. He played in seven of the Penguins' 24 post-season games as the team returned to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Red Wings for the second straight year. Sýkora made his first appearance of the series in Game 6, but injured his right foot blocking a shot six minutes into the contest. Sidelined for the deciding Game 7, he forced his swelled foot into a skate to join the Penguins on the ice for their post-game celebration after defeating the Red Wings 2–1. Although Sýkora won the trophy with the Devils in 2000, he was unable to lift the Stanley Cup after a hit sent him to the hospital the night of the victory.\n\nIn the off-season, Sýkora was not re-signed by the Penguins and he became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2009. Without an NHL contract, Sýkora accepted a tryout with the Minnesota Wild on September 14. Three days later, the Wild signed him to a one-year, $1.6 million contract on September 17. He suffered a concussion early in the 2009–10 season, however, and was sidelined for two months. Through 14 games, he had recorded just three points and was placed on waivers by the Wild on January 19, 2010. On January 28, the Wild announced that Sýkora had cleared unconditional waivers, officially making him an unrestricted free agent.\n\nWithout an NHL contract, Sýkora returned to Europe, signing with HC Plzeň to start the 2010–11 season. After recording 13 points (five goals and seven assists) over 13 games while playing on a line with Martin Straka and Jan Kovář, he signed a tryout contract with Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on November 11, 2010. Over 28 games in the KHL, he scored eight goals and 15 points.\n\nOn September 12, 2011, it was announced that Sýkora would attend the New Jersey Devils' training camp on a tryout, hoping to return to the team that drafted him into the NHL. On October 5, 2011, he signed a one-year contract with the Devils worth $650,000.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, Sýkora played in his 1,000th career NHL game.\n\nIn 2002, Sýkora was selected to play for the Czech Republic in the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where the team placed seventh. Two years later, Sýkora also represented the Czech Republic in the 2004 World Cup. Sýkora has also won three Men's World Ice Hockey Championships medals, one bronze (1998) and two gold medals (1999 and 2005).\n\n"}
{"id": "2067725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067725", "title": "Mitchell Freeway", "text": "Mitchell Freeway\n\nMitchell Freeway is a freeway in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, linking central Perth with the satellite city of Joondalup. It is the northern section of State Route 2, which continues south as Kwinana Freeway and Forrest Highway. Along its length are interchanges with several major roads, including Graham Farmer Freeway and Reid Highway. The southern terminus of the Mitchell Freeway is at the Narrows Bridge, which crosses the Swan River, and the northern terminus is at Hester Avenue, Clarkson, a suburb within the City of Wanneroo.\n\nPlanning for the route began in the 1950s, and the first segment in central Perth was constructed between 1967 and 1973. The Mitchell Freeway has been progressively extended north since then. In the 1970s, the first two extensions were completed, up to Hutton Street in Osborne Park. By the end of the 1980s, the freeway had reached Ocean Reef Road in Edgewater. The Joondalup railway line was constructed in the freeway median in the early 1990s. This necessitated the relocation of a section of the southbound carriageway, and the construction of three new bridges. In conjunction with these works, additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section.\n\nSince the 1990s, extensions to the Mitchell Freeway have taken it to Burns Beach Road at the northern edge of Joondalup. During 2013, two sections of the northbound carriageway were widened with an additional lane. In August 2017, an extension was completed to Hester Avenue, after construction starting in 2014. Further works are planned, which will take the freeway past Yanchep and Two Rocks to the boundary of the Perth Metropolitan Region.\n\nThe Mitchell Freeway is the northern section of State Route 2. It commences at the northern end of the Narrows Bridge, Perth, continuing from Kwinana Freeway, and terminates just north of the satellite city of Joondalup at Hester Avenue, Clarkson. All intersections with the freeway are via grade separated interchanges. The speed limit is except in central Perth, where the limit is reduced to as the freeway interchanges with Graham Farmer Freeway and Mounts Bay Road. South of Hepburn Avenue, the freeway has 3 to 5 lanes in each direction. From that point north, there are mostly two lanes in each direction, expanding to three lanes between Hodges Drive and Shenton Avenue. The median strip of the freeway also houses the Joondalup railway line, with all but two of the line's stations also built on the strip. Additionally, a is built alongside most of the freeway.\n\nThe section near the Perth city centre, within the City of Perth local government area (LGA), features many partial access interchanges. The Narrows Interchange is located just north of the Narrows Bridge, on the eastern edge of Kings Park. This is a hybrid interchange connecting the freeway with Mounts Bay Road and Riverside Drive, over a distance of . There is complete access to and from Mounts Bay Road via a standard northbound exit ramp and looped ramps for the other movements. There is a partial Y-Interchange incorporated for direct access to and from Riverside Drive via a southbound exit ramp and a northbound entrance ramp. All other traffic movements must be made via Mounts Bay Road. The Riverside Drive entrance ramp merges with the Mounts Bay Road northbound entrance ramp. The southbound exit ramp is similarly shared, before diverging for three destinations: Mounts Bay Road, Riverside Drive, and the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre car park. The main northbound exit to Hay Street is via an access road, which begins on the Mounts Bay Road exit ramp. The access road rejoins the freeway as an outside lane on the shared Riverside Drive and Mounts Bay Road entrance ramp. The Hay Street exit ramp, a short distance later, can be accessed from the two outermost lanes. This allows the traffic entering the freeway from the ramp to continue north or exit at Hay Street without weaving.\n\nThe freeway continues north-westerly for , splitting Mount Street in half, and passing under Malcolm Street. After this, it turns north-easterly for , and lines up with the city blocks between George and Elder streets, a pair of one way frontage roads. The freeway also marks the boundary between Perth and West Perth. Partial access is provided to or from all the roads that the freeway crosses over (or under in the case of Hay Street). North of Roe Street, the freeway turns north-west towards Glendalough over the course of . In this section the freeway marks the boundary between the City of Perth and City of Vincent LGAs. There is a full Y-Interchange here with Graham Farmer Freeway, which bypasses the Perth city centre via a tunnel, and provides access to Perth Airport. Combined with this interchange is a partial Y-Interchange with Charles Street. The southbound entrance ramp merges with, and northbound exit ramp diverges from, the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps. There is a traffic light controlled intersection with Newcastle Street at the northern end of these ramps. Charles Street is the start of State Route 60, an alternative route to Perth's northern suburbs and areas north of the Perth Metropolitan Region. Located in the vicinity of these interchanges are the Sutherland Street northbound entrance ramp, from West Perth, and a southbound exit ramp to both Roe Street, and Wellington Street, Perth. The Loftus Street overpass, near the northwestern end of the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps, is the edge of the City of Perth LGA; beyond this point the freeway is the boundary between West Leederville in the Town of Cambridge and Leederville in the City of Vincent.\n\nIn the northern suburbs of Perth, most of the interchanges are standard diamond interchanges, and the rest are modified versions, which have ramps missing or replaced with loop ramps. The first interchange north-west of West Perth, is with Vincent Street and Lake Monger Drive. This interchange has a looped southbound entry ramp, so that Leederville Parade can join to the south side of intersection with Vincent Street and the southbound ramps. The northbound exit ramp terminates at Southport Street, south of Vincent Street and Lake Monger Drive. The freeway then proceeds northwest for alongside Lake Monger's eastern edge, after which there is a half diamond interchange with Powis Street, with only a northbound exit ramp and a southbound entrance ramp. The freeway continues north, now within the City of Stirling LGA, through Osborne Park, until it reaches Hutton Street after . There are several local roads in Osborne Park that have T-Junction intersections with the freeway ramps south of Hutton Street. These are McDonald Street West and Hector Street West, with the northbound exit ramp; and Cape Street, Hector Street, and McDonald Street with southbound entry ramps. The freeway has an S-curve after Hutton Street, moving to an alignment further west that does not bisect any suburbs. The interchanges with Cedric Street on the S-curve, and Karrinyup Road at the end of the S-curve, are diamond interchanges. There are slight modifications to the entrance and exit ramps between these roads, which merge for , requiring traffic to weave. The curved section is the boundary between Stirling to the east of the freeway, and Osborne Park and Innaloo to the west.\n\nThe next interchange, after , is with Erindale Road. It is another half diamond interchange, with only northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps. Beyond Erindale Road, the suburb to the east of the freeway is Balcatta, and further north is Reid Highway, with the southbound entry ramp looped. Balcatta Road joins the intersection of the southbound ramps with Reid Highway. Reid Highway, together with Tonkin Highway, provides a limited-access route to Perth Airport.\nNorth of Reid Highway, Mitchell Freeway divides Carine to west from Hamersley to the east. There is no access to next major road, Beach Road. It forms the border between the City of Stirling and City of Joondalup LGAs; as well as between Carine and Duncraig west of the freeway, and Hamersley and Warwick to the east. However, Warwick Road's interchange is only north of Reid Highway. It is a standard diamond interchange, but weaving is required between Reid Highway and Warwick Road due to the short distance between the interchanges. Greenwood is located north of Warwick Road and east of the freeway.\nThe following two interchanges, after and respectively, are with Hepburn Avenue and Whitfords Avenue. The Hepburn Avenue interchange is located at the corners of Duncraig, Greenwood, Kingsley, Western Australia, and Padbury; while the Whitfords Avenue interchange is located at the corner of Kingsley, Padbury, Cragie, and Woodvale. Each interchange also provides access for the railway stations in the median (Greenwood and Whitfords respectively) via the southbound entry ramps, which are two-way north of the carparks' entrances. North of here, over a distance of , are standard diamond interchanges with Ocean Reef Road, Hodges Drive, and Shenton Avenue, which provide access to Joondalup city centre, and Joondalup Health Campus, east of the freeway. West of the freeway are the suburbs of Heathridge, Connolly and Currambine. The Edgewater railway station lies just to the north of the Ocean Reef Road interchange (road access via Joondalup Drive), with the railway deviating to the east from the median just south of Hodges Drive to stop at Joondalup railway station.\n\nAfter north of the Shenton Avenue interchange, the railway line re-enters the freeway median just prior to passing under Moore Drive. Both the freeway and railway line then pass over Burns Beach Road, further north with the Currambine railway station lying to the south. The diamond interchange with Burns Beach Road is the northernmost fully signalised interchange on the freeway and lies at the corner of Currambine, Joondalup, Kinross and Neerabup. The next interchange, after , is with Neerabup Road and is a hybrid interchange where the western side is a teardrop roundabout common to dogbone interchanges while the eastern side is a full roundabout similar to a dumbbell interchange. The latter is due to the southbound entry ramp being built with a second roundabout to the south. Although currently unused, it is likely to be used as access to any future parking at Clarkson railway station immediately to the north of the interchange (similar to the setups at the Hepburn and Whitfords Avenue interchanges). The current freeway terminus is reached north at Hester Avenue at a partial dogbone interchange. Until the freeway is extended, access to areas further north is provided by Marmion Avenue to the west of the terminus, or via Wanneroo Road to the east.\n\nThe Mitchell Freeway began as a highway proposed in the Metropolitan Region Scheme in the mid-1950s. The original plan took the route, then known as Yanchep Highway, inland from what is now known as Karrinyup Road to the intersection of Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Road. However, the first gazetted edition of the Metropolitan Region Scheme, from 1963, shows a controlled-access highway along the current freeway alignment. The later plan only detailed the route up until a point east of Sorrento, at a proposed east-west controlled-access highway on the modern day Hepburn Avenue alignment.\n\nDetailed design on the first stage of the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the northern edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.\n\nWork on the section north of Wellington Street, known as the Hamilton Interchange, began in October 1969. It was partially opened on 17 November 1971, but was not completed until 4 October 1972. The final part of the project to be completed was the Narrows Interchange. Construction began in 1970 with the installation of thirteen caissons, which would house foundation columns. Placement of the caissons was difficult; as well as sinking vertically as intended, they also tilted and slid horizontally. Corrections were made by selective excavation, blasting bedrock, and applying tension via guy-wires. Following the foundation works, construction proceeded swiftly; most of the work was completed by 1972. Premier John Tonkin opened the interchange on 30 November 1973. This initial section functioned only as a distributor for Narrows Bridge traffic accessing Perth's central business district or adjacent areas to the north-west. Whilst initially referred to as the \"Western Switch Road\", it was renamed after the former Western Australia State Premier and Governor Sir James Mitchell, on 5 June 1963. In 2008, Stage 1 was declared a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\nSeveral stages were built through the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The first extension of the freeway was nearly a mile long (), taking the freeway to Vincent Street. This stage also included a long, curving bridge, eight-span bridge connecting northbound traffic to Charles Street. The construction of this stage, which began in February 1974, resulted in the suburb of Leederville being split in two. Residential and industrial buildings were demolished, and streets were cut off on both sides of the freeway's path. The extension opened to traffic on 8 March 1976, having cost $15.15 million. It was opened by the state Minister for Transport, Mr R J O’Connor, MLA. A commemorative plaque was located under the bridge leading to Charles Street.\n\nThe design of Stage 3 of the freeway, a section extending to Hutton Street, was completed in 1974. The existing soil was not suitable for construction, as the area generally consisted of soft peat and old landfills. In 1975, the ground was consolidated with of sand. Construction took place between 1976 and 1978, with the section opened by the Minister for Transport, David Wordsworth, on 2 June 1978. A commemorative plaque was unveiled at the Powis Street bridge. This stage cost $12.5 million, and received the Institution of Engineers Australia's Western Australian Division Engineering Excellence Award in 1978.\n\nAfter a four-year gap, construction of Stage 4 began, which would take the freeway to Erindale Road. The first half of the stage, up to Karrinyup Road, opened on 12 December 1983, while the project wasn't complete until 21 September 1984. It was opened by the state Minister for Transport Julian Grill, MLA. This section completed of freeway in Perth, from Bull Creek to Balcatta. The next two stages were constructed together, extending the freeway to Hepburn Avenue. Stage 5 was from Erindale to Warwick Road, and involved excavating a large quantity of material, including of limestone. That stage cost $22.73 million, while Stage 6 only cost $8.06 million. Both stages were opened together, on 6 August 1986. The first stage of Reid Highway (then known as the North Perimeter Highway) was built at the same time, and opened on 16 May 1986. A further extension to Ocean Reef Road was opened on 2 July 1988 by the Federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, at a cost of $17.5 million. The state and federal governments provided most of the funds, $9.7 million and $5.2 million respectively. The City of Wanneroo contributed $1.3 million, Joondalup Development Corporation $1 million, and land developers $300,000, as they wanted the freeway built ahead of schedule to stimulate local development.\nIn 1991 and 1992, the median strip of the entire freeway was significantly widened to accommodate the Joondalup railway line, being built under the Northern Suburbs Transit System project. The line was to be located in the middle of the road reserve, between the freeway carriageways. At the time, the northbound and southbound carriageways, between Loftus Street and McDonald Street, were positioned next to each other, with space for future widening located on the eastern side of the road reserve. Initially, three new road bridges were constructed over Vincent Street, Powis Street, and Scarborough Beach Road. Once the road bridges had been completed and surfacing works completed, the southbound carriage was relocated, creating the required space for the railway line construction. Additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section, funded from regular road funding sources, whilst the bridges and some associated works were included as part of the costs for the Northern Suburbs Transit System project.\nAfter a 7-year-hiatus, a extension to Hodges Drive was opened by the Premier Richard Court in December 1999, two months ahead of schedule. The project also included widening the section between Karrinyup Road and Hepburn Avenue to three lanes in each direction.\n\nAfter another 7-year-hiatus, construction began on a 4-kilometre extension to Burns Beach Road, with a diamond interchange at Shenton Avenue and an overpass for Moore Drive. Local residents were opposed to aspects of the initial plans, such as the design of a section near a primary school and the clearing of native vegetation. The state government therefore established the Community Consultative Working Group and later the Construction Reference Group, composed of members of the local community. The input from these groups resulted in several changes to the design. The project was managed by Main Roads in conjunction with Macmahon Contractors. Construction of the extension was initially planned for May 2006, but began on 14 December 2006. By July 2008, 90% of the works had been completed and the new section was predicted to open in September 2008. However, the official opening was not until 2 November 2008, when the road was opened by Western Australia's Minister for Transport, Simon O'Brien, and the previous Minister for Planning and Infrastructure Alannah MacTiernan. The $160 million project was completed $10 million under budget. The opening was celebrated with a procession of vintage cars along the new freeway segment.\n\nIn its 2011/12 budget, the State Government committed $30 million for the widening of Mitchell Freeway northbound between Hepburn Avenue and Hodges Drive from two to three lanes. Traffic volumes in the preceding years had increased rapidly, almost reaching the previously projected 2016 traffic volume of 40,000 vehicles per day. The resulting congestion in the afternoon traffic peak increases the chances of rear-end crashes as well as driver frustration. Construction of the third lane began in February 2013, the section from Hepburn Avenue to Ocean Reef Road opened in August 2013 with the remaining section to Hodges Drive completed in early 2014. As part of the project, the existing lanes were resurfaced during the summer months of 2013–14.\n\nThe freeway was also expanded further during 2013 with an extra lane northbound between Perth and Hutton Street, in conjunction with works to increase the capacity of the Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel. Works progressed in two stages, with Vincent Street as the midpoint. As part of the project, the overpasses at Powis Street, Vincent Street and Scarborough Beach Road have been widened. An additional slip lane has been constructed, from Graham Farmer Freeway's Loftus Street exit ramp to Mitchell Freeway northbound, to access Vincent Street without changing lanes to the left lanes of Mitchell Freeway northbound. The project commenced in February 2013 and was completed in December 2013.\n\nIn October 2012 the state government announced that the freeway's interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange. The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual carriageway near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge, and a second free-flowing loop ramp between Reid Highway westbound to Mitchell Freeway northbound. The dual carriageway works commenced construction in May 2015 and were completed a year later.\n\nThe latest extension was from Burns Beach Road to Hester Avenue. In December 2012, the State Government announced the freeway would be extended between 2014–15 and 2016–17, over a distance of . The extension included interchanges at Burns Beach Road and Neerabup Road. Work on the extension began with a ground-breaking ceremony on 20 May 2015. The projected cost was $261.4 million, with the federal government contributing $209.1 million and the state government funding the remaining $52.3 million. The project scope included a dual carriageway extension to Hester Avenue, Clarkson, with grade-separated interchanges at Burns Beach Road, Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue. Other roads in the area were upgraded, including widening Hester Avenue and Wanneroo Road, and extending Neerabup Road east to the intersection of Flynn Drive and Wanneroo Road. The project was completed on 3 August 2017, opened by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Premier Mark McGowan and Transport Minister Rita Safiioti.\n\nThe southbound section of the freeway between Cedric and Vincent Streets is currently being widened to four lanes and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. $40 million was assigned to the freeway widening itself, with a further $19 million allocated for the upgrade and completion of a Principal Shared Path (PSP) between Scarborough Beach Road and Hutton Street, including a separated pedestrian and cyclist overpass over the former. The bridge for the overpass was notoriously delivered during peak hour on 11 September 2019, causing a traffic jam for southbound commuters.\n\nThe corresponding northbound section from Hutton to Cedric Street is also being widened to four lanes, with the northbound exit lane onto the latter also being widened to two lanes. of concrete barriers are also planned to be installed between Glendalough Station and Erindale Road. Work is expected to commence in October 2019 and finish by September 2020.\n\nThere is a longer term plan to add a third lane to the southbound carriageway of the freeway from Hodges Drive to Hepburn Avenue. The Australian Federal Government has already committed $35 million to the project.\n\nThe Mitchell Freeway is planned to continue north to the Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 the formation of the Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This was followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue in 2017. An expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos is proposed to be completed by 2021.\n\nThere is a plan to extend Stephenson Avenue northbound from its current terminus with Scarborough Beach Road to terminate at Cedric Street as part of the Stirling City Centre development project.

Perkins joined CBS affiliate WUSA in Washington, D.C. for six weeks, beginning October 21, 2019, for the station's morning show, \"Get Up DC!\", which became a full-time assignment when he was named a full-time anchor of the show in January 2020.\n\nPerkins was born on August 25, 1959 in New York City to Constance Bellamy (1938-2018) and Tommy Perkins (d. 1992). His parents had met when his father was working at a shoe store in New York. Together, the family lived in the South Bronx until moving to Washington, D.C., when he was five years old. His parents divorced when he was 11, and his mother worked as a telephone operator and night clerk to raise the family. He attended elementary school in Washington, D.C., junior high in Maryland and Virginia, and graduated from Mount Vernon High School in Alexandria, Virginia in 1977. In high school, Perkins had a good academic record and was involved in many extracurricular activities, including becoming the first black editor-in-chief of his school's student newspaper.\n\nHe received his Bachelor of Arts degree from American University's School of Communication in 1981. During college, he worked with the campus radio station and the black student newspaper, later eventually helping to found the campus television station.\n\nPerkins comes from a line of family members involved in the radio business, including his father, who had worked at WOL and WOOK, and his uncle, who worked at WFIL as a radio engineer.\n\nPerkins has a younger brother, Scott, who worked as an art director for CNN.\n\nBefore becoming a journalist, Perkins was a professional stand-up comedian from 1983 to 1993, appearing at clubs and colleges across the country, which helped him meet and come to work for Donnie Simpson as an off-air producer. He had also been working in radio for Cathy Hughes at WOL. \n\nThroughout his career, Perkins has continued to support his alma mater and is an active member of the American University School of Communication's Dean Council. \n\nPerkins began his broadcast career as a desk assistant for the ABC News Washington, D.C. bureau in the early 1980s. From 1986 to 1988, he hosted and produced \"DC20 Breakaway\" for WDCA. From 1993 to 1998, he served as a weather forecaster at Fox's Washington, D.C. owned-and-operated station, WTTG, and co-anchored the station's \"Fox Morning News\" from 1998 to 1999. \n\nAfter six years at WTTG, Perkins joined ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on March 8, 1999 as the program's weekday morning weather forecaster and features reporter, where his catchphrase to turn it over to the local weather was \"the weather in your neighborhood.\" He succeeded Spencer Christian on \"Good Morning America\", who had moved to San Francisco to become a weather anchor for KGO-TV in 1999. During Perkins's time together with Robin Roberts, Diane Sawyer, and Charles Gibson, they were able to help \"Good Morning America\" bounce back in its television ratings against its morning show competitors after it experienced a slump in the mid-to-late-1990s. Perkins also co-hosted \"Stealing Scenes,\" an entertainment-focused show for \"ABC News Now\". In 2004, Perkins made a cameo on the ABC sitcom, \"Less than Perfect\". That same year, he was also invited onto \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" as a guest. \n\nOn December 2, 2005, Perkins left \"Good Morning America\" to return to WTTG and was succeeded by Mike Barz. During his second stint on WTTG, Perkins continued as morning weather anchor and gradually transitioned to become the main anchor for the weekday morning newscast alongside Allison Seymour in July 2012. He was later transferred to the evening 5:00PM newscast with Laura Evans and 10:00PM newscast with Shawn Yancy on October 28, 2013.\n\nOn January 19, 2019, Perkins departed WTTG to spend more time on his radio commitments. \n\nOn October 21, 2019, he joined CBS's Washington, D.C. affiliate WUSA for six weeks to be a part of the station's \"Get Up DC!\" morning show, together with Reese Waters and Annie Yu.\n\nOn January 7, 2020, just under a year after he left WTTG, it was announced that Perkins was returning to WUSA to anchor \"Get Up DC!\" full-time. The assignment will allow him to continue hosting his radio show on WMMJ in the afternoons.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, while working as a comic, Perkins also served as a writer, producer, and on-air contributor to \"The Donnie Simpson Show\" on WKYS-FM. He later co-hosted \"The Morning Crew\" on WKYS-FM from 1992 to 1993.\n\nPerkins was an occasional in-studio guest on the \"Don and Mike Show\", and its successor, the \"Mike O'Meara Show.\" From 2014 to 2018, he also hosted his own weekly comedy and entertainment podcast with co-host Gary Stein, the \"Tony Perkins Show featuring Gary Stein\".\n\nOn December 18, 2017, Perkins announced that he would be returning to WMMJ-FM 102.3 Majic with Donnie Simpson as the afternoon drive host for a reboot of \"The Donnie Simpson Show\" on weekdays from 3:00PM to 7:00PM. To accommodate the schedule, he moved his anchoring schedule on WTTG from weeknight evenings to Friday and Saturday morning shows.\n\nPerkins earned an Emmy Award in 1988 for his work on \"DC20 Breakaway\". He has also earned an additional Emmy Award. \n\nPerkins is married to Rhonda Perkins, who worked as a social services administrator, and has a son named Connor.\n\n"}

{"id": "2067746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067746", "title": "Dharani", "text": "Dharani\n\nA dharani (Devanagari: धारणी, IAST: ) is a Buddhist chant, mnemonic code, incantation, or recitation, usually a mantra consisting of Sanskrit or Pali phrases. Believed to be protective and with powers to generate merit for the Buddhist devotee, they constitute a major part of historic Buddhist literature. These chants have roots in Vedic Sanskrit literature, and many are written in Sanskrit scripts such as the Siddham as well as transliterated into Chinese, Korean, Japanese and other regional scripts.\n\nDharani are found in the ancient texts of all major traditions of Buddhism. They are a major part of the Pali canon preserved by the Theravada tradition. Mahayana sutras – such as the Lotus Sutra and the Heart Sutra – include or conclude with dharani. Some Buddhist texts, such as \"Pancaraksa\" found in the homes of many Buddhist tantra tradition followers, are entirely dedicated to dharani. They are a part of their ritual prayers as well as considered to be an amulet and charm in themselves, whose recitation believed to allay bad luck, diseases or other calamity. They were an essential part of the monastic training in Buddhism's history in East Asia. In some Buddhist regions, they served as texts upon which the Buddhist witness would swear to tell the truth.\n\nThe dharani-genre of literature became popular in East Asia in the 1st millennium CE, with Chinese records suggesting their profusion by the early centuries of the common era. These migrated from China to Korea and Japan. The demand for printed dharani among the Buddhist lay devotees may have led to the development of textual printing innovations. The dharani records of East Asia are the oldest known \"authenticated printed texts in the world\", state Robert Sewell and other scholars. The early-8th-century dharani texts discovered in the Pulguksa temple of Gyeongju, Korea are considered as the oldest known printed texts in the world.\n\nDharani recitation for the purposes of healing and protection is referred to as Paritta in some Buddhist regions, particularly in Theravada communities. The dharani-genre ideas also inspired the Japanese Koshiki texts, and chanting practices called \"Daimoku\", \"Nenbutsu\" (Japan), \"Nianfo\" (China) or \"Yombul\" (Korea). They are a significant part of the historic Chinese \"dazangjing\" (scriptures of the great repository) and the Korean \"daejanggyeong\" – the East Asian compilations of the Buddhist canon between the 5th and 10th centuries.\n\nThe word \"dhāraṇī\" derives from a Sanskrit root √\"dhṛ\" meaning \"to hold or maintain\". This root is likely derived from the Vedic religion of ancient India where chants and melodious sounds were believed to have innate spiritual and healing powers even if the sound cannot be translated and has no meaning (as in a music). The same root gives \"dharma\" or \"dhamma\". According to the East Asian Buddhism studies scholar Paul Copp, some Buddhist communities outside India sometimes refer to \"dharanis\" with alternate terms such as \"mantra, hṛdaya (hridiya), paritrana (paritta), raksha (Pali: rakkha), gutti, or vidyā\" though these terms also have other contextual meanings in Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the traditional belief in Tibetan texts, states Jose Cabezon – the Dalai Lama professor of Tibetan Buddhism studies, there were three councils and the term \"dharani\" was recorded and became the norm after the third council. The first council, according to this belief, compiled the \"Sutranta\", the \"Vinaya\" and the \"Abhidhamma\" in Vimalabhada to the south of Rajagriha in India. The first council was held in the year Buddha died, but the compiled dhamma consisted of spoken words that were not written down. The second council occurred about 200 years after the death of the Buddha in a grove provided by Ashoka, where the knowledge was compiled again, but it too did not write anything down. The third council gathered in Kashmir a century later, according to the Tibetan tradition, and the teachings were put down in writing for those \"who had not obtained the power (\"dharani\") of not-forgetting\" because people were reciting corrupted forms of the teachings of the Buddha. In this context, \"dharani\" were acknowledged in the Buddhist tradition by about 2nd-century BCE, and they were a memory aid to ground and remember the \"dhamma\" teachings.\n\nThe term dharani as used in the history of Mahayana and tantric Buddhism, and its interpretation has been problematic since the mid-19th-century, states Ronald Davidson. It was initially understood as \"magical formula or phrase\", but later studies such as by Lamotte and Berhard interpreted them to be \"memory\", while Davidson proposes that some dharani are \"codes\". According to Eugène Burnouf, the 19th-century French Indologist and a scholar of Buddhism, dharanis are magical formulas that to Buddhist devotees are the most important parts of their books. Burnouf, states Davidson, was the first scholar to realise how important and widespread dharani had been in Buddhism sutras and Mahayana texts. The Indologist Moriz Winternitz concurred in early 20th-century that dharanis constituted a \"large and important\" part of Mahayana Buddhism, and that they were magic formulae and \"protective spells\" as well as amulets.\nAccording to Winternitz, a dharani resembles the incantations found in the \"Atharvaveda\" and \"Yajurveda\" of Hinduism. The dharani-genre of Buddhist literature includes mantra, states Étienne Lamotte, but they were also a \"memory aid\" to memorize and chant Buddha's teachings. This practice was linked to concentration (\"samadhi\") and believed to have magical virtues and a means to both spiritual and material \"karma\"-related merit making. According to Braarvig, the dharanis are \"seemingly meaningless strings of syllables\". While they may once have been \"memory aids\", the dharanis that have survived into the modern era do not match with any text. In later practice, the dharanis were \"hardly employed as summaries of doctrine, but were employed as aids to concentration and magical protection benefits\".\n\nAccording to Jan Nattier, Vedic mantras are more ancient than Buddhist dharani, but over time they both were forms of incantations that are quite similar. In the early texts of Buddhism, proposes Nattier, \"it would appear that the word dharani was first employed in reference to mnemonic devices used to retain (Skt. \"hold\") certain elements of Buddhist doctrine in one's memory\". In Nattier's view, the term dharani is \"peculiar to Buddhism\". A dhāraṇī can be a mnemonic to encapsulate the meaning of a section or chapter of a sutra. According to the Buddhism-related writer Red Pine, \"mantra\" and \"dharani\" were originally interchangeable, but at some point \"dhāraṇī\" came to be used for meaningful, intelligible phrases, and mantra for syllabic formulae which are not meant to be understood.\n\nAccording to Robert Buswell and Ronald Davidson, \"dharani\" were codes in some Buddhist texts. They appeared at the end of the text, and they may be seen as a coded, distilled summary of Buddhist teachings in the chapters that preceded it. For example, the \"Vajrasamadhi-sutra\" – a Korean Buddhist text likely composed in the 7th-century by an unknown monk, one important to the Ch'an (Zen Buddhism) tradition in East Asia, the \"Dharani\" chapter is the eighth (second last), with a brief conversational epilogue between the Tathagata Buddha and Ananda being the last chapter. This \"dharani\" chapter, states Buswell, \"encodes (\"dharayati\") the important meanings, without forgetting them, and it reminds and codes the points to remember.\n\nThe Indologist Frits Staal who is known for his scholarship on mantras and chants in Indian religions, states the Dharani mantras reflect a continuity of the Vedic mantras. He quotes Wayman to be similarly stressing the view that the Buddhist chants have a \"profound debt to the Vedic religion\". The Yogacara scholars, states Staal, followed the same classification as one found in the Vedas – \"arthadharani\", \"dharmadharani\" and \"mantradharani\", along with express acknowledgment like the Vedas that some \"dharani are meaningful and others are meaningless\" yet all effective for ritual purposes.\n\nThe early Buddhism literature includes the dharani spells and incantations. It demonstrates that dharanis were valued and in use within Buddhist communities before the 1st-century CE, state Charles Prebish and Damien Keown.\n\nThe role of dharanis in Buddhist practice of mid-1st-millennium CE is illustrated by numerous texts including the systematic treatises that emerged. According to Paul Copp, one of the earliest attestable literary mandate about writing dharanis as an effective spell in itself is found in a Chinese text dated between 317 and 420 CE. This text is the \"Qifo bapusa suoshuo da tuoluoni shenzhou jing\" (or, Great Dharani Spirit-Spell Scripture Spoken by the Seven Buddhas and Eight Bodhisattvas). \"The Collected Dhāraṇī Sūtras\", for example, were compiled in the mid-seventh century. Some of the oldest Buddhist religious inscriptions in Stupas (Dagoba, Chörten) are extracts from dharani-genre compositions such as the \"Bodhigarbhalankaralaksa-dharani\". Manuscript fragments of \"Sumukha-dharani\" discovered in Central Asia and now held at the Leningrad Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences are in the Sanskrit language and the Brahmi script, a script that was prevalent before the early centuries of the common era.\n\nThe Chinese text \"Wugou jing guangda tuoluoni jing\" of the influential Empress Wu's era – 683 to 705 CE – is about the Buddha reciting six \"dharanis\". The first part states its significance as follows (Japanese version of the Chinese text):\nEarly mentions of dharani in the European literature are from the records left by John of Plano Carpini (1245–7) and William of Rubruck (1254) where they wrote in their respective memoirs that Uighurs and Mongols chanted \"Om man baccam\", later identified with \"Om mani padme hum\". They also mention that these Asians write \"short sorcery sentences on paper and hang them up\". Other than such scant remarks, little was known about the Dharani-genre of literature or its value in Buddhism till the mid-19th-century colonial era, when Brian Hodgson began buying Sanskrit and related manuscripts in Nepal, Tibet and India for a more thorough scholarship, often at his personal expense. According to Hodgson, as quoted by Ronald Davidson, dharani were esoteric short prayers \"derived from [Buddhist tantric] Upadesa\" that are believed to be amulet to be constantly repeated or worn inside little lockets, something that leads to \"a charmed life\".\n\nThe colonial era scholarship initially proposed that the dharanis and related rituals may have been an influence on Buddhism of other Indian religions such as from the esoteric tantra traditions of Hinduism around the mid-1st-millennium CE. This assumption, along with the view that early Buddhism was an \"abstract philosophy or even a broad-based social movement\" is now a part of a scholarly debate. With increased access to the primary texts of Buddhism and the discoveries of historical manuscripts in China, Korea and Japan, such as those about early Silla Buddhism, McBride and others state that dharani incantations and ritualism had widespread significance in East Asia from the early years. Coupled with Waddell's scholarship on the \"dharani cult in Buddhism\" in early 20th-century, the post-colonial era scholarship proposed that dharanis did not develop with or after tantric Buddhism emerged, but preceded it and were a form of proto-tantrism.\n\nAccording to Richard McBride, as well as Richard Payne, the \"proto-tantra\" proposal too is problematic because it is a meaningless anachronistic teleological category that \"misleads\" and implies that the dharanis somehow anticipated and nurtured Buddhist tantra tradition. There is no evidence for such a sequential development. Instead, the evidence points to an overlap but that the significance of the dharanis in mainstream Buddhist traditions and the esoteric Buddhist tantra tradition co-existed independent of each other. Phonic mysticism and musical chanting based on dharanis – \"parittas\" or \"raksas\" in the Theravada Pali literature – along with related mantras were important in early Buddhism. They continue to be an essential part of actual Buddhist practice in Asia, both for its laypersons and the monks. The emerging evidence and later scholarship increasingly states that \"dharani and ritual procedures were mainstream Mahayana practices\" many centuries before the emergence of tantric and esoteric Buddhism and Vajrayana, states McBride. The Buddhist tantra traditions added another layer of sophistication and complexity to the rituals with deities and mandalas.\n\nDharanis are not limited to an esoteric cult within Buddhism, states Paul Copp, rather the \"dharani incantations and related mystic phrases and practices have been integral parts of nearly all Buddhist traditions since at least the early centuries of the common era\".\n\nDhāraṇīs are a form of amulet and believed in the various Buddhist traditions to deliver protection from malign influences and calamities. Mantra and dharani are synonymous in some Buddhist traditions, but in others such as the Tibetan tantric traditions a dharani is a type of mantra. According to Jose Cabezon, in the tantric traditions, mantra (\"sngags\") is all knowledge and the mind of all the Buddhas, that which possesses the \"dharma-dhatu\" (essence of dhamma). The mantra exist in three forms – \"guhya\" (secret), \"vidya\" (knowledge) \"dharani\" (memory aid). The \"guhya\" mantra are about male deity and female deity relationships and union. The \"vidya\" mantra represent the mind of male Buddhist deities, while \"dharani\" mantras of the female Buddhist deities. Theologically, the \"vidya\" mantras constitute that knowledge in tantric Buddhism, according to Cabezon, which \"pacifies the suffering experienced in the existential world (\"samsara\") and the heaps of faults such as desire\". The \"dharani\" mantras, in contrast, constitute that knowledge in tantric Buddhism which \"causes one to hold onto the \"dhamma\", to remember the \"dhamma\", to remember virtue\". There is very little prescriptive or practical difference between dharani and mantras except that dharani are much longer, states Eugene Burnouf.\n\nAccording to Winternitz, a Buddhist dharani resembles the incantations and mantras found in Hinduism. A dharani may contain simple magical syllables and words without any literal meaning (\"mantra-padani\"), or its power is believed to result from it containing words or wisdom \"in nunce\" from a Buddhist Sutta. The Japanese Horiuzi manuscript of \"Prajna paramita hrdaya sutra\" and \"Usnisha Vijaya dharani\" dated to 609 CE illustrate both, with the latter being only invocations consisting of meaningless series of syllables. In Buddhism, a dharani has been believed to have magical virtues and a means to earn merit to offset the past \"karma\", allay fear, diseases and disasters in this life, and for a better rebirth. To the lay Buddhist communities, states Davidson, the material benefits encouraged the popularity and use of dharanis for devotionalism, rituals and rites in Buddhism. According to Janet Gyatso, there is a difference between mantras and dharanis. The mantras are more than melodious sounds and have meaning, and these were found sporadically in pre-Mahayana Buddhism. With the emergence of the Mahayana Buddhism tradition, the dharanis became closely related to mantras. Later, as the Vajrayana Buddhism tradition grew, they proliferated. The dharanis and mantras overlap because in the Vajrayana tradition. There exist \"single seed-syllable \"bija\" like dharanis, treated as having special powers to protect chanters from dangers such as \"snakes, enemies, demons and robbers\". The \"bija\" (seed) mantra condenses the protective powers of a Buddhist deity or a Buddhist text into a single syllable. For example, the single letter \"a\" (अ) condenses the 100,000 verses of the \"Prajna-paramita sutras\" into a single syllable.\nThe Japanese Buddhist monk Kūkai drew a distinction between \"dhāraṇī\" and \"mantra\" and used it as the basis of his theory of language. According to Kūkai, a Buddhist \"mantra\" is restricted to esoteric Buddhist practice whereas \"dhāraṇī\" is found in both esoteric and exoteric rituals. In the Nara and early Heian period of Japanese history, a monk or nun was tested for their fluency and knowledge of dharanis to confirm whether they are well trained and competent in Buddhist knowledge. Their appointment letters listed the sutras and dharanis that he or she could recite from memory. In an appointment recommendation letter dated 732 CE, as an example, a Japanese priest named Chishu supports the ordination of his student Hata no kimi Toyotari by listing that he can recite following dharanis: \"the \"Greater Prajna-paramita\", Amoghapasa Avalokiteshvara, Eleven-faced Avalokiteshvara, the \"Golden Light\", Akashagarbha, Bhaisajyaguru, consecrating water, concealing ritual space\" with the dharani rituals of prostration after eight years of training. A study of numerous such \"ubasoku koshinge\" recommendation letters from the 1st-millennium Japan confirm that dharanis were an essential and core part of monastic training, though the specific group of dharanis memorized by a monk or nun varied.\n\nKūkai classified mantras as a special class of dhāraṇīs and argued that every syllable of a dhāraṇī was a manifestation of the true nature of reality – in Buddhist terms, that all sound is a manifestation of \"śūnyatā\" or emptiness of self-nature. Thus, rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dhāraṇīs are in fact saturated with meaning – every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.\n\nThe dharanis have been a large and important part of Mahayana Buddhist literature. They are particularly abundant in the esoteric tradition of Buddhism (Vajrayana, Tibetan). However, the dharanis were not unique to esoteric Mahayana texts. The most significant and popular Mahayana sutras such as the \"Lotus Sutra\", \"Heart Sutra\" and others prominently include dharani chapters. The dharanis are prominent in the \"Prajñāpāramitā Sutras\" wherein the Buddha \"praises dharani incantation, along with the cultivation of samadhi, as virtuous activity of a bodhisattva\", states Ryûichi Abé.\n\nThe \"Megha-Sutra\" is an example of an ancient Mahayana magico-religious text. In it, the snake deities appear before the Buddha and offer him adoration, then ask how the suffering of snakes, as well as people, can be alleviated. The text suggests friendliness (\"maitri\") and lists numerous invocations such as those to female deities, exorcisms, means to induce rains, along with a series of magical formulae such as \"\"sara sire sire suru suru naganam java java jivi jivi juvu juvu etc.\"\", states Moriz Winternitz. The historic Mahayana dharanis have survived as single manuscripts as well as large collections. The versions found in Nepal and China include spells to end sickness, lengthen life, recovery from poison, magic for luck in war, drive away demons and snakes, protection from the effects of ill-omened constellations, release from a confessed sin, birth of a son or daughter to a woman wanting a baby, rebirth into \"sukhavati\" heaven or avoiding a bad rebirth. The snake-charm dharani is found in the Bower Manuscript found in Western China. While a 443 CE Chinese translation of Lankavatara Sutra does not contain some of the dharani chapters, other Chinese translations dated to the 2nd-century and 4th-century CE of Mahayana texts do contain dharanis. The Dunhuang manuscript collections include extensive talismanic dharani sections. The dharanis as conceptualized by medieval era Buddhist intellectuals and eminent Chinese monks were an \"integral component of mainstream Sinitic Buddhism\", states Richard McBride. The popularity of Buddhist spells in China was probably because older native Chinese religions valued spells already.\n\nAccording to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, it is \"almost certain\" that some of the East Asian Buddhist literature on dharani were indigenous Chinese texts and syncretic with the Daoist practices. For example, the \"Guanding jing\" composed in mid-5th century in China is largely a collection of magical spells in the dharani-genre in twelve semi-independent chapters. It includes spells such as those of the 72,000 spirit kings to protect Buddhist monks, spells of the 120,000 spirit kings to protect the Buddhist nuns, incantations of spirit kings to protect one's surroundings, seals and spells to subdue devils, chants to summon dragon kings to treat infections and remove pests, and seeking rebirth in pure lands of one's desire.\n\nThe significance of dharanis was such that both the government and monastic organization had stipulated, by the 7th-century, how and when dharanis may or may not be used. A \"ritsuryo\" code for Buddhist clerics dated 718 CE, promulgated by the Nara government in Japan, forbid the use of dharani for any unauthorized medical treatment, military and political rebellion. The code explicitly exempted their use for \"healing of the sick by chanting dharanis in accordance with the Buddha dharma\". Another document dated 797 CE mentions \"healer-meditation masters\" (\"kanbyo zenji\") in dharanis to protect the family of the ruler. Others evidence the use of dharani chanting by monks and nuns as \"one of the common methods of healing during the Nara period\", states Ryûichi Abé.\n\nThe dharanis were an essential part of the \"rokujikyoho\" (six-syllable sutra) liturgy ritual in Japan. They were greatly popular between the 11th- and 15th-centuries and a part of comprehensive solution to various ailments, a ritual performed by Buddhist monks and practitioners of \"onmyōdō\".\n\nThe Theravada tradition is found in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian Buddhist countries. The three historic ritual practices of the Theravada community include the Buddha puja (\"triratna\" rite), the Five Precepts ceremony (\"pancasil\"), and the protective chanting of Paritrana (\"paritta\"). The Theravada Paritrana texts are equivalent to the Dharani texts in the Mahayana tradition, both providing protective charm through chanting of hymns. According to Buddhist studies scholars Sarah LeVine and David Gellner, Theravada lay devotees traditionally invite the monks into their homes for rites of \"protection from evil\" and the monk(s) chant the paritrana hymns. These rituals are particularly common during rites-of-passage ceremonies such as baby naming, first rice-eating and others. According to Buddhologist Karel Werner, some Mahayana and Vajrayana dharani texts influenced the paritta texts of Theravada tradition, such as the Gini (fire) Paritta, as the hymns are identical in parts and the Theravada text uses the same terms, for example, \"\"dharani dharaniti\"\".\n\nThe Pali canon makes many references to protective (\"raksha\", \"paritta\") incantations and magical spells. These invocations provide protection from \"malignant spirits, disease and calamity\". For example, in \"Digha Nikaya\" (DN I.116.14), Sonadanda remarks that wherever the Buddha stays, \"non-humans do not harm the people of that town or village\", states the Buddhism scholar Peter Skilling. This and similar statements are also found in the early Chinese translations of Indian Buddhist texts. According to Skilling, these \"protective Buddhist literature\" are used by both the monks and the laypeople of Theravada countries. These texts are a part of any \"meagre library of Buddhist Sri Lankan households\" and they are called \"Pirit Pota\". In Myanmar, all classes of the Theravada community more widely know about the \"paritta\" incantation literature than any other Pali Buddhist work. The average Theravada monk in other southeast Asian countries who may not know much about a \"Tipitaka\", states Skilling, is likely to \"be able to recite numerous chants [paritta, dharani] from memory\".\n\nIn northern Thailand, the \"Suat Boek Phranet\" (lit. Eye-Opening Sutta) is a Pali chant text used during rites such as the consecration of a Buddha image. The text, states Donald Swearer, includes a \"unique dharani in praise of the Buddha\" and his victory over the evil Mara. Though the dharani appears at the end of the text and the associated chant in Thai Buddhist practice occurs at the close of the ceremony, they highlight their key role in \"the \"buddhabhiseka\" ritual\".\n\nThe Buddhist dharani invocations are the earliest mass printed texts that have survived. Till the mid-20th-century, the \"Hyakumantō Darani\" found as charms in wooden pagodas of Japan were broadly accepted as having been printed between 764 and 770 CE, and the oldest extant printed texts. In 1966, similarly printed dharani were discovered in stone pagoda of Pulguksa temple in Gyeongju, Korea. These are dated to the first half of the 8th-century, and now considered as the oldest known printed texts in the world. According to Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin, the Korean dharani scrolls were printed after the era of Empress Wu in China, and these date \"no earlier than 704 CE, when the translation of the sutra was finished, and no later than 751, when the building of the temple and stupa was completed\". The printed Korean text consists of \"Chinese characters transliterated from the [Indian] Sanskrit\". While the Korean dharani were likely printed in China, the evidence confirms that the Japanese dharani were printed in Japan from Buddhist chants that arrived through China. The tradition of printing and distributing the Buddhist dharanis, as well as transliterated Sanskrit sutras, continued in East Asia over the centuries that followed. By the 9th-century, the era of mass printing and the sale of books had begun covering additional subjects such as \"astrology, divination of dreams, alchemy, and geomancy\".\n\nAccording to languages and ancient manuscripts scholar Ernst Wolff, \"it was Buddhism, above all, that eminently stimulated and sustained printing activities\". Its chants and ideas were in demand in East Asia, and this led to the development of wood-block based mass printing technology. The oldest known dharanis were mass-produced by the 8th-century, and later in the 10th-century the canonical \"Tripitaka\" in addition to 84,000 copies of dharanis were mass printed.\n\nThe 8th-century dharanis are the \"oldest authenticated printed texts in the world\", states Robert Sewell. These were mass-produced as a set consisting of miniature hollow wooden pagodas each containing a printed dharani prayer or charm in Sanskrit on thick paper strips. The Japanese records state a million dharanis were so produced and distributed through Buddhist temples by the order of Empress Shōtoku – previously a Buddhist nun – after an attempted coup against her court. According to Ross Bender, these events and Empress Shōtoku's initiatives led to the founding of major new Buddhist temples, a \"great acceleration\" and the \"active propagation of Buddhism\" in Japan. Empress Shōtoku's million dharanis are among the oldest known printed literature in the world.\n\nWhile dharanis are found inside major texts of Buddhism, some texts are predominantly or exclusively of the dharani-genre.

As an industrial chemical major uses include in the manufacture of wood preservatives, pesticides, and glass. As a medication it is used to treat a type of cancer known as acute promyelocytic leukemia. For this use it is given by injection into a vein.\nCommon side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, swelling, shortness of breath, and headaches. Severe side effects may include APL differentiation syndrome and heart problems. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding may harm the baby. Arsenic trioxide has the formula . How it works in cancer is not entirely clear.\nArsenic trioxide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Approximately 50,000 tonnes are produced a year. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS £292 a dose as of 2018. In the United States this amount costs about US$508 as of 2019. Due to its toxicity a number of countries have regulations around its manufacture and sale.\n\nArsenic trioxide is used to treat a type of cancer known as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). It may be used both in cases that are unresponsive other agents, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or as part of the initial treatment of newly diagnosed cases. This initial treatment may include combination therapy of arsenic trioxide with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).\n\nEffectiveness appears similar to Realgar/Indigo naturalis, which can be taken by mouth and is less expensive but is less available.\n\nIn the 1970s, Chinese researcher Zhang Tingdong and colleagues discovered this use. It was approved for leukemia treatment in the United States in 2000. University of Hong Kong developed a liquid form of arsenic trioxide that can be given by mouth. Organoarsenic compounds, such as feed additives (roxarsone) and medication (neosalvarsan), are derived from arsenic trioxide.\n\nIndustrial uses include usage as a precursor to forestry products, in colorless glass production, and in electronics. Being the main compound of arsenic, the trioxide is the precursor to elemental arsenic, arsenic alloys, and arsenide semiconductors. Bulk arsenic-based compounds sodium arsenite and sodium cacodylate are derived from the trioxide.\n\nA variety of applications exploit arsenic's toxicity, including the use of the oxide as a wood preservative. Copper arsenates, which are derived from arsenic trioxide, are used on a large scale as a wood preservative in the U.S. and Malaysia, but such materials are banned in many parts of the world. This practice remains controversial. In combination with copper(II) acetate, arsenic trioxide gives the vibrant pigment known as Paris green used in paints and as a rodenticide. This application has been discontinued.\n\nDespite the well known toxicity of arsenic, arsenic trioxide was used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as \"pi-shuang\" (. In homeopathy, it is called arsenicum album. Some discredited patent medicines, e.g., Fowler's solution, contained derivatives of arsenic oxide.\n\nArsenic trioxide is readily absorbed by the digestive system: toxic effects are also well known upon inhalation or upon skin contact. Elimination is rapid at first (half-life of 1–2 days), by methylation to monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsonic acid, and excretion in the urine, but a certain amount (30–40% in the case of repeated exposure) is incorporated into the bones, muscles, skin, hair and nails (all tissues rich in keratin) and eliminated over a period of weeks or months.\n\nThe first symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning by ingestion are digestive problems: vomiting, abdominal pains, diarrhea often accompanied by bleeding. Sub-lethal doses can lead to convulsions, cardiovascular problems, inflammation of the liver and kidneys and abnormalities in the coagulation of the blood. These are followed by the appearance of characteristic white lines (Mees' lines) on the nails and by hair loss. Lower doses lead to liver and kidney problems and to changes in the pigmentation of the skin. Even dilute solutions of arsenic trioxide are dangerous on contact with the eyes.\n\nThe poisonous properties are well known and the subject of an extensive literature.\n\nChronic arsenic poisoning is known as arsenicosis. This disorder affects workers in smelters, in populations whose drinking water contains high levels of arsenic (0.3–0.4 ppm), and in patients treated for long periods with arsenic-based pharmaceuticals. Similarly, studies on workers exposed in copper foundries in the U.S., Japan and Sweden indicate a risk of lung cancer 6–10 times higher for the most exposed workers compared with the general population. Long-term ingestion of arsenic trioxide either in drinking water or as a medical treatment can lead to skin cancer. Reproductive problems (high incidences of miscarriage, low birth weight, congenital deformations) have also been indicated in one study of women exposed to arsenic trioxide dust as employees or neighbours of a copper foundry.\n\nIn Austria, there lived the so-called \"arsenic eaters of Styria\", who ingested doses far beyond the lethal dose of arsenic trioxide without any apparent harm. Arsenic is thought to enable strenuous work at high altitudes, e.g. in the Alps.\n\nIn the U.S., the OSHA 1910.1018 occupational permissible exposure limit for inorganic arsenic compounds in breathing zone air is 0.010 mg/m.\n\nArsenic trioxide can be generated via routine processing of arsenic compounds including the oxidation (combustion) of arsenic and arsenic-containing minerals in air. Illustrative is the roasting of orpiment, a typical arsenic sulfide ore.\nMost arsenic oxide is, however, obtained as a volatile by-product of the processing of other ores. For example, arsenopyrite, a common impurity in gold- and copper-containing ores, liberates arsenic trioxide upon heating in air. The processing of such minerals has led to numerous cases of poisonings. Only in China are arsenic ores intentionally mined.\n\nIn the laboratory, it is prepared by hydrolysis of arsenic trichloride:\n\nArsenic trioxide is an amphoteric oxide, and its aqueous solutions are weakly acidic. Thus, it dissolves readily in alkaline solutions to give arsenites. It is less soluble in acids, although it will dissolve in hydrochloric acid.\n\nWith anhydrous HF and HCl, it gives AsF and the trichloride:\n\nOnly with strong oxidizing agents such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric acid does it yield arsenic pentoxide, or its corresponding acid:\nIn terms of its resistance to oxidation, arsenic trioxide differs from phosphorus trioxide, which readily combusts to phosphorus pentoxide.\n\nReduction gives elemental arsenic or arsine () depending on conditions:\nThis reaction is used in the Marsh test.\n\nIn the liquid and gas phase below 800 °C, arsenic trioxide has the formula and is isostructural with . Above 800 °C significantly dissociates into molecular , which adopts the same structure as . Three forms (polymorphs) are known in the solid state: a high temperature ( > 110 °C) cubic , containing molecular , and two related polymeric forms. The polymers, which both crystallize as monoclinic crystals, feature sheets of pyramidal units that share O atoms.\n\nIn the United Kingdom it costs the NHS £292 a dose as of 2018. In the United States this amount costs about US$508 as of 2019. With initial treatment being 60 days the cost for a course of treatment is £17,520 and US$30,000 respectively.\n\nSmelting and related ore processing often generate arsenic trioxide, which poses a risk to the environment. For example, the Giant Mine in Canada processed substantial amounts of arsenopyrite-contaminated gold ores.\n\n"}

In 2007, he managed the Japanese national team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nIn October 2010 Hoshino was hired as manager of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. The team had earlier dismissed former manager Marty Brown after a last place finish in their league. Hoshino led the Eagles to a Pacific League championship and Japan Series championship in 2013.\n\nHoshino was born the third of three children in Kurashiki, Japan. His father died three months after he was born, and his mother raised him and his two sisters alone. He played baseball throughout his high school years, but was unable to advance to the Koshien baseball tournament. He entered Meiji University, and became a starter from his first year. He marked 23 total wins in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League, including one no-hitter, but his team never won the league championship. Hoshino's reputation as a hot-headed leader began in his years at Meiji University, when he and other members of the baseball team banded together to break down a barricade set up around the school by a student protest group.\n\nHoshino was drafted in the first round by the Chunichi Dragons in 1968, led by manager Shigeru Mizuhara. The Yomiuri Giants had promised Hoshino that he would be their first round draft pick, but the Giants broke their promise, drafting another player instead. This betrayal made Hoshino develop a profound hatred towards the Giants, and he has battled the Giants ever since, both as a pitcher and as a manager. Hoshino signed with the Dragons in 1969, and pitched both as a starter and reliever, quickly becoming the ace of the Dragons pitching staff. He led the league in saves in 1974, and won the Eiji Sawamura Award. More importantly, however, his team won the league championship, stopping the Yomiuri Giants record of consecutive league championships at 9. He was known as the \"Kyojin Killer\" (Giants Killer) because he seemed to pitch unusually well against the Giants. His team won another league championship in 1982, and Hoshino retired after that year. His career record was 146–121, with 34 saves.\n\nHoshino was an extremely popular figure during his career, not because of his skill as a pitcher, but because of his persona. Baseball fans were sick of seeing the Yomiuri Giants win the championship year after year, and Hoshino's outspoken hatred of the Giants finally gave fans a player to root for beside Shigeo Nagashima and Sadaharu Oh. Hoshino stayed with the Dragons for his entire career, and was very well respected by his teammates.\n\nHoshino worked as a commentator for NHK after retiring, and his popularity with both fans and players called him back to the Chunichi Dragons as a manager in 1987. Hoshino made a number of big trades, and led the Dragons to a league championship in 1988. He stepped down in 1991, and returned to his job as a commentator and sports writer.\n\nThe Dragons did poorly after Hoshino's departure, and he was once again called back to lead the team in 1996. Hoshino won his second league championship in 1999, but stepped down again after his team placed 5th in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Hoshino was called to take over as manager of the miserable Hanshin Tigers, who had been in last place for the last four years under Katsuya Nomura. He raised the team to fourth place in his first year, and made huge cuts during the off-season while recruiting free agents like Tomoaki Kanemoto and Hideki Irabu. The Tigers won the league championship in 2003; Hoshino's third championship as manager. However, he frequently fell ill during games in 2003, often leaving the head coach to manage the team while he sat quietly on the bench. He stepped down after the 2003 Japanese championship series due to health reasons, allegedly due to high blood pressure and heart arrhythmia, but was the assistant senior director of the Hanshin Tigers until 2010. In 2007, he became the manager of the Japan national baseball team, which won the Asian Baseball Championship (the qualifier for the Beijing Olympics) defeating the Philippines, Korea, and Taiwan. However, the \"Hoshino Japan\" finished with a 4–5 record in the 2008 Beijing Olympics with no medals.\n\nAfter the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles decided to let Marty Brown go after the first year of a two-year contract, Hoshino was brought on to manage the team and signed to a one-year, ¥150 million contract for the 2011 season. After a fifth-place PL finish and the positive development of the team's younger players, team owner Hiroshi Mikitani requested that Hoshino stay on as manager for the next few seasons. In the 2013 season, the Eagles' ninth, he went on to lead the team to its first PL pennant, first successful Climax Series run, and first Japan Series title. The following season, however, the Eagles finished in last place and Hoshino announced that he would stepping down as manager. His managerial tenure remains the team's longest.\n\nHoshino died of pancreatic cancer in Tokyo on 4 January 2018 at the age of 70.\n\n"}

It is defined as iterated (repeated) tetration, just as tetration is iterated exponentiation. It is a binary operation defined with two numbers \"a\" and \"b\", where \"a\" is tetrated to itself \"b\" times. For instance, using hyperoperation notation for pentation and tetration, formula_1 means tetrating 2 to itself 3 times, or formula_2. This can then be reduced to formula_3\n\nThe word \"pentation\" was coined by Reuben Goodstein in 1947 from the roots penta- (five) and iteration. It is part of his general naming scheme for hyperoperations.\n\nThere is little consensus on the notation for pentation; as such, there are many different ways to write the operation. However, some are more used than others, and some have clear advantages or disadvantages compared to others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values of the pentation function may also be obtained from the values in the fourth row of the table of values of a variant of the Ackermann function: if formula_22 is defined by the Ackermann recurrence formula_23 with the initial conditions formula_24 and formula_25, then formula_26.\n\nAs tetration, its base operation, has not been extended to non-integer heights, pentation formula_4 is currently only defined for integer values of \"a\" and \"b\" where \"a\" > 0 and \"b\" ≥ −1, and a few other integer values which \"may\" be uniquely defined. As with all hyperoperations of order 3 (exponentiation) and higher, pentation has the following trivial cases (identities) which holds for all values of \"a\" and \"b\" within its domain:\n\n\nAdditionally, we can also define:\n\n\nOther than the trivial cases shown above, pentation generates extremely large numbers very quickly such that there are only a few non-trivial cases that produce numbers that can be written in conventional notation, as illustrated below:\n\n"}

However, he failed to make a breakthrough in the Manchester United first team and followed United assistant manager Steve McClaren to Middlesbrough in 2001. During his time at Middlesbrough, Greening earned his first call-up to the England national team, but he did not make an appearance. In 2004, he joined West Bromwich Albion for £1.25 million, and, in 2008, captained the team to the Championship title. Greening signed for Fulham in 2009 and helped them to the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final, before signing permanently the following summer. He signed for Nottingham Forest in 2011 and had a three-year spell with the club.\n\nBorn in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Greening joined the York City youth system at the age of 15. He signed with the club's Youth Training Scheme in December 1996 and broke into the first team towards the end of the 1996–97 season, making his debut as substitute in a 1–1 draw away to Bournemouth on 22 March 1997.\n\nFollowing a four-day trial with Manchester United in February, he signed for the Premier League team on 25 March 1998 for what was understood to be an initial fee of £500,000, which could have potentially risen to £2 million dependent on appearances and international recognition, with a sell-on clause. He later admitted that he signed for United on £400 a week without looking at the contract. As an attacking midfielder, he faced massive competition from more established players in both positions and his first-team opportunities were restricted, although he did make the substitute's bench in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final. He later admitted that he \"felt a bit of a fraud\" for picking up his winner's medal, having not played a single minute of European football that season. He did however make a contribution to their victorious FA Cup campaign, coming on as a substitute at half-time in their fifth round tie with future club Fulham.\n\nGreening signed a new contract with United at the end of 1999–2000, but by 2001 he had become frustrated by the lack of first-team opportunities, and conceded that he would need to leave the club in order to play regularly.\n\nOn 9 August 2001, Greening joined Middlesbrough for a combined fee of £3 million which saw both him and United teammate Mark Wilson head to Teesside to rejoin former Manchester United assistant manager Steve McClaren, who was by now the manager of Middlesbrough. Greening remained on Teesside for three seasons, being voted Club Player of the Year for 2002–03 and also being selected for the full England squad (though he did not play). But his first-team chances were more limited during 2003–04, after which he signed for West Bromwich Albion for an initial fee of £1.25 million. Greening was part of Middlesbrough's 2004 League Cup-winning team, despite not making the squad for the final.\n\nGreening made his Albion debut in a 1–1 draw away to Blackburn Rovers on the opening day of the 2004–05 Premier League season, and quickly established himself as a key player in the Baggies' midfield, helping to secure their Premier League survival in his first season. He was named Albion's Player of the Year in 2005–06, in which he made 41 appearances and scored 2 goals as the club was relegated to the Championship.\n\nHe signed a new three-year contract with Albion in August 2007, and was made club captain for 2007–08. His performances during the campaign led to him being named in the Championship Team of the Week on several occasions. Greening missed the fifth round FA Cup match at Coventry City due to suspension, but it was the only match he missed during the campaign; he started all 46 league matches and also participated in eight out of nine cup games. He captained Albion in the FA Cup semi-final, where they lost 1–0 to Portsmouth, and one month later led the team to promotion as winners of the Championship. Greening was named in the 2007–08 Championship PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammates Paul Robinson and Kevin Phillips. During the last two months of the season Greening suffered from a double hernia problem but played on until the end of the campaign, when he had an operation to rectify the injury.\n\nTowards the end of 2008–09, Greening said he was looking to sign a new contract with Albion. He was offered a new four-year contract by the club, but instead handed in a transfer request in July 2009.\n\nOn 14 July 2009, West Brom rejected a \"derisory\" bid from Fulham for Greening. Nevertheless, on 24 August 2009, Greening joined Fulham on a season-long loan for 2009–10, with a view to a permanent move upon completion of the loan period. He scored his first and only league goal for Fulham against Portsmouth on 3 February 2010. He also came off the bench in the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final defeat against Atlético Madrid.\n\nGreening signed a two-year contract with Fulham on 1 July 2010 after a successful loan spell the previous season. After signing, he was mainly used as a substitute and was seen as a 'fringe' player. Under new manager Mark Hughes, he rarely featured, making only 10 league appearances in 2010–11.\n\nOn 18 July 2011, Greening signed a three-year contract with Championship club Nottingham Forest for an undisclosed fee, reuniting with manager Steve McClaren for the second time after working with him at both Manchester United and Middlesbrough. Greening said the move met his desire to seek regular football. He took up a coaching role with Forest's under-21 team in July 2013, after attaining UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences over the summer. Greening made 13 appearance for Forest in 2013–14 before being released by the club in May 2014.\n\nGreening made his only appearance for the England national under-18 team as a substitute for Danny Cadamarteri in a 1–0 home defeat to France on 23 April 1998. His first cap for the under-21 team came after starting the 2–2 away draw with Hungary on 27 April 1999, with his first goal coming in the 61st minute of a 6–1 home win over Georgia on 31 August 2000. Greening was drafted into the England squad for the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship as a replacement for the injured Michael Carrick, two days prior to their first match of the tournament. He played in the final Group A match, a 3–1 loss to Portugal on 22 May 2002, with England being eliminated from the tournament after finishing bottom of Group A. This proved to be the final of his 17 appearances for the under-21s, for whom he scored three goals. Greening was also called up to the full England squad by Sven Goran Eriksson but failed to make an appearance.\n\nAlthough naturally right-sided, Greening can operate anywhere across the midfield. Initially an attacking wide midfielder, he later moved to a central midfield holding role. Teammate Dean Kiely once described how Greening \"sprays passes around like a quarterback\" in Albion's style of attacking football under Tony Mowbray.\n\nGreening began assisting with coaching the Academy team of his former club York, then in League Two, during the summer of 2014, before retiring from playing professionally during September 2014. He signed for Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Tadcaster Albion on 19 September 2014, where his younger brother Josh played, making his debut the next day in a 6–0 away win over Maltby Main. Greening was appointed as Development Phase Coach at York's Academy on 22 December 2014, a role focusing on the development of the team's players aged 16 to 18.\n\nHe registered as a player with York on non-contract terms on 13 November 2015, to provide cover with a number of midfielders unavailable. His second York debut came two days later as a half-time substitute for Rhys Turner in a 2–1 home defeat to Plymouth Argyle; according to \"The Press\", he \"inspired an improved second-half display \". Greening was sent off for violent conduct after elbowing Michael Doyle on his third appearance, in a 6–0 away defeat to Portsmouth on 24 November 2015, for which he received a three-match suspension. He left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2015, despite offering only days earlier to carry on playing for the rest of 2015–16. Greening rejoined Tadcaster on 30 December 2015. He made 21 appearances and scored one goal in 2015–16 as Tadcaster won the Northern Counties East League Premier Division title, and thus promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One North.\n\nHe is currently a coach alongside Richard Cresswell at i2i International Soccer Academy, which is based in York, England.\n\nGreening married Anna Stubbings, in North Yorkshire, during the second quarter of 2002. He was the joint best man at former York City teammate Richard Cresswell's wedding held June 2003.\n\nManchester United\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\n\nTadcaster Albion\n\nIndividual\n"}

{"id": "2067800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067800", "title": "Bootham Crescent", "text": "Bootham Crescent\n\nBootham Crescent in York, North Yorkshire, England, is the home of York City football club and York City Knights rugby league club. With a capacity of 8,256, it is near the city centre, just over a mile from York railway station.\n\nYork City leased land at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a replacement for their ground at Fulfordgate on the outskirts of the city. The ground was constructed in four months, and opened on 31 August 1932. In the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an air-raid shelter, and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built.\n\nThe David Longhurst Stand opened in 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street End, named after the former York player David Longhurst who died during a match at the ground in 1990. Bootham Crescent hosted Football League matches from 1932 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2016, both spells ending after York were relegated into non-League football. The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestlé. York are expected to move to a community stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington in mid 2019, and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing.\n\nBootham Crescent comprises four stands: the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End. The ground has held a league representative match, neutral club matches, and schoolboy and youth international matches. Other than football, it has hosted a concert, firework display, American football and rugby league matches and beer festivals. The record attendance of 28,123 was set in March 1938, for an FA Cup match against Huddersfield Town. The highest seasonal average attendance of 10,412 was achieved in 1948–49.\n\nYork City F.C. played at Fulfordgate in Fulford, on the southern outskirts of York, from 1922 to 1932. It was difficult for most supporters to reach, being a good distance from the railway station, and the tram service to Fulford only had a single track. Attendances declined in the club's second and third seasons in the Football League, which the directors blamed on Fulfordgate's location. One director, G. W. Halliday, became convinced that the only solution was to move to a new ground. York Cricket Club left Bootham Crescent, their home for around 50 years, for a new ground at Wigginton Road in January 1932. Preliminary discussions and visits to Bootham Crescent took place, and the directors believed that renting the ground would be cheaper than repaying the debts on Fulfordgate. Further, Bootham Crescent was situated near the centre of the city, and the population living within a mile of the site was, at 30,000, 10 times that within a similar radius of Fulfordgate. However, two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited.\n\nThe directors were unanimous that a change should be made, and a special meeting of the shareholders was held on 26 April 1932. The move to Bootham Crescent on a 21-year lease was approved by 115 votes to 37. The site of York's new home was of an irregular shape and was hemmed in from four sides, with a narrow track to the south, barracks to the west, a school and almhouses to the north and terraced houses to the east. Nonetheless, the grounds of the city's football, cricket and rugby league teams were now within a few hundred yards of each other. The ground was renovated over the summer of 1932; the area was drained and then built to the design of local architects Ward & Leckenby. The Popular Stand was erected on the west side using sections of the terrace cover at Fulfordgate, with the Main Stand built opposite. Terraces were banked up in the wedge-shaped areas behind the goals. After four months of construction, Bootham Crescent was ready for the 1932–33 season, with an initial capacity of over 30,000.\n\nThe ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, when York played Stockport County in a Third Division North match. The club president, Sir John Hunt, marked the occasion by cutting a ribbon of the club's colours of chocolate and cream. In attendance were the Lord Mayor of York, the Sheriff of York, the vice-president of the Football League, the treasurer of the Football Association (FA) and the local Member of Parliament. York player Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground in a 2–2 draw, played before 8,106 supporters. In the first four seasons at Bootham Crescent, attendances were not higher, and were sometimes lower than at Fulfordgate. There were problems with the ground in its early years; the quality of the pitch was questioned, and the \"Lincolnshire Echo\" remarked in April 1937 that the pitch was \"almost a morass, with extensive pools of water in front of the goals\". There was an incident in March 1934 where the referee and linesmen were found unconscious in their dressing room, due to fumes from a faulty heater.\n\nThe ground first hosted a match against First Division opposition on 12 January 1935 when York played Derby County in an FA Cup third-round match, which set a new club record attendance of 13,612. Attendance records were set at four successive stages of the 1937–38 FA Cup, culminating in the 28,123 attendance for the sixth-round match against Huddersfield Town on 5 March 1938. By now the ground's capacity was around 23,000, and seats were placed around the pitch to accommodate more fans. During the Second World War, the tunnel at the back of the Popular Stand was used as an air-raid shelter for pupils and staff of Shipton Street School. The ground was slightly damaged after the air-raid on York in April 1942, when houses along the Shipton Street End were bombed. Considerable improvements were made in the immediate post-war period. Deeper drainage and the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End were completed, and loudspeaking equipment was installed.\n\nIt was announced at the shareholders' annual meeting in September 1948 that York had purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075, with the club's finances in a strong position at the time. Bigger crowds were recorded around the country in the post-war period, and York achieved five-figure average attendances in 1948–49 and 1955–56. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand, due to the efforts of the supporters' club, and the Shipton Street End. York reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, and two matches from this run were played at Bootham Crescent: the first-round match against Scarborough, which York won 3–2, and the fifth-round match against Tottenham Hotspur, which was won 3–1 before a crowd of 21,000. During the summer of 1955, the Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street, funded by profits gained from the FA Cup run and a stand extension fund.\n\nA concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at the ground in the summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.\n\nYork reached the quarter-final of the 1961–62 League Cup, and in the earlier rounds beat Bristol City, Leicester City, Watford and Bournemouth at Bootham Crescent. The half-time scoreboard at the Shipton Street End ceased to be used by 1965, but remained as advertising boarding. On 5 May 1969, referee Roy Harper collapsed and died on the pitch during a match against Halifax Town. Seats were installed in the Popular Stand for 1974–75, York's first season in the Second Division. This increased the ground's seating capacity to 2,762, but meant the overall capacity was reduced to 16,529. The floodlights were updated and improved for £20,000, and were officially switched on by former Wolverhampton Wanderers player Derek Dougan for a friendly with Grimsby Town on 1 August 1980. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End for £50,000 early in 1981, and to help towards this York received £15,000 from the Sports Council and £20,000 from the Football League Improvement Trust. In the summer of 1983, new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents' lounge. The lounge was officially opened by Jack Dunnett, the chairman of the Football League, prior to a match against Wrexham in November 1983.\n\nBy the early 1980s cracks had appeared in the wall built at the back of the Grosvenor Road End. The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500. The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985. All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s. During the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End. Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End. Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room were readied. Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986–87, and video equipment was installed inside the ground. Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met. These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats. However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628.\n\nThe ground's major drawback was the lack of covered standing accommodation at the Shipton Street End, but the cost of erecting a stand had been prohibitive. The Shipton Street Roof Appeal was launched in the spring of 1988 to raise money for a stand, and fundraising schemes were put into place. On 8 September 1990, York player David Longhurst collapsed and died from heart failure during a match against Lincoln City at Bootham Crescent. With the approval of his family, the David Longhurst Memorial Fund was launched, and all donations were added to the monies already raised for the roof appeal. The Football Trust contributed half of the £150,000 cost of the stand, and it was constructed in the summer of 1991. The David Longhurst Stand was officially opened on 14 October 1991 in a friendly match against Leeds United, which was watched by a crowd of 4,374.\n\nThe Family Stand was opened in the Main Stand in 1992, and manager John Ward ran the London Marathon to help raise funds for the project. Bootham Crescent first hosted a play-off match when York beat Bury 1–0 on 19 May 1993 in the Third Division play-off semi-final; the attendance of 9,206 was the ground's highest in seven years. During 1993–94 the Main Stand paddock was seated and covered, and the recent work to the stand cost £220,000. The ground's capacity fell to 9,459, including seating for 3,645, after the renovations to the David Longhurst and Main Stands. In May 1995, a new drainage system was installed for £11,000, to improve the quality of the pitch during winter. New floodlights were installed in June 1995 at a cost of £122,000, and despite being shorter in height were twice as powerful as the original floodlights. A water tower was installed in the late 1990s, to further help the pitch quality.\n\nIn July 1999, York's real property assets, including Bootham Crescent, were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH) for £165,000. Chairman Douglas Craig put the ground and the club up for sale for £4.5 million in December 2001. It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium. In March 2002, the club was bought by John Batchelor; he said York could continue at Bootham Crescent until a new stadium was built, when in fact the previous 25-year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003. Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor, and Persimmon, who held 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 homes on the site of Bootham Crescent. In March 2003, York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004, and under the ownership of the Supporters' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium. Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards, and the club preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent. York bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, after a £2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) was secured.\n\nYork were relegated to the Conference National for 2004–05, which brought an end to 72 years of Football League football at Bootham Crescent. In January 2005 the ground was renamed KitKat Crescent, as part of a sponsorship deal under which Nestlé donated £100,000 to the club. This money went towards covering the shortfall the club faced paying BCH directors, Persimmon and stamp duty when buying the ground. The ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. The deal expired in January 2010, when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. York returned to the Football League for 2012–13, and their first League Two match at Bootham Crescent was a 3–1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012, before a 4,591 crowd. The club was relegated to the National League for 2016–17, ending a four-year spell back in the Football League. The ground has not been subject to any major investment since the 1990s, and has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions.\n\nThe terms of the FSIF loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a new stadium were in place, the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation. As part of the loan agreement, Persimmon have first refusal on purchasing Bootham Crescent once York leave, for 10% lower than its market value. Persimmon still intend to build 93 homes on the site, and the proceeds of the sale would go towards building the new stadium. In March 2008, York's managing director Jason McGill cited \"the annual cost of £60,000 for the maintenance and upkeep of a 1932 stadium with few commercial and income-generating opportunities\" as the reason for the continued need to move to a new stadium.\n\nDespite the club failing to formally identify a site by the end of 2007, financial penalties were not incurred, as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made. However, McGill said plans with the preferred site had ground to a halt by March 2008. City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008, which would be used by York and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights. In July 2010, the council chose the option of building a 6,000-all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, on the site of Huntington Stadium. In August 2014, Greenwich Leisure Ltd were named as the council's preferred bidder to deliver an 8,000-all-seater stadium, a leisure complex and a community hub. Construction started in December 2017, for completion in mid 2019.\n\nThe ground can accommodate 8,256 supporters, including seating for 3,409, and comprises four stands; the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End.\n\nThe Main Stand, which can seat 1,757 spectators, is an all-seated stand which runs around two-thirds of the pitch. It contains the dressing rooms, club offices, ticket offices and hospitality suites, and contains a number of supporting pillars. The stand has open corners to either side, one of which is where the supporters' club is located, and to the rear has windscreens to either side. At the front of it is the Family Stand, which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers. Opposite is the Popular Stand, a covered all-seated stand, which contains a number of supporting pillars and holds a television gantry on its roof. It can seat 1,652 spectators.\n\nThe northernmost stand of the ground is the David Longhurst Stand, which is a covered terrace for home supporters and has a row of supporting pillars across its front. The stand was originally known as the Shipton Street End, but was renamed following the death of David Longhurst, and has a capacity of 3,062. Opposite is the Grosvenor Road End, an open terrace reserved for away supporters, which holds a capacity of 1,785. As well as this, away fans are permitted to use 332 seats of the Popular Stand, in the section closest to the Grosvenor Road End. The toilet facilities for away supporters consist of open air urinals and Portakabins.\n\nThe grass pitch measures . Head groundsman Bryan Foster was presented with a gold watch from the directors in March 1988, in recognition of his long and outstanding service. His successor, Bryan Horner, was voted the Second Division groundsman of the year in 1999. A club shop is situated just inside the car park, which also houses the commercial manager's office. Adjoining this is the social club, known as the 1922 Bar since August 2015, and the players' bar.\n\nThe ground is located just over a mile from York railway station, which is approximately a 20-minute walk. The station lies on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross railway station and Edinburgh Waverley railway station, and has direct services from Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and the South West. Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only, meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult. The author Simon Inglis pointed out the irony of the club leaving Fulfordgate because of its location, when \"it is harder than ever for fans to drive \"in\" to Bootham Crescent\". Parking on matchdays at nearby York Hospital is available. A park and ride facility operates in the city, and a number of lines drop off within walking distance of the ground.\n\nBootham Crescent hosted a war-time representative match in which the Football League XI beat the Northern Command XI 9–2 on 17 October 1942, before a 5,500 crowd. It held a university representative match on 17 February 1976, when a FA XI drew 2–2 with the Universities Athletic Union; the FA XI included former England internationals and 1966 World Cup winners Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles. The ground hosted its first major neutral match on 7 February 1968, when Middlesbrough beat Hull City 1–0 in an FA Cup third-round second replay, in front of a crowd of 16,524. During 2012–13, Bootham Crescent held one fixture apiece for Harrogate Town and Gateshead, as the pitches at their grounds were unplayable. The ground hosted the 2013 FA Women's Premier League Cup Final on 5 May 2013, when Aston Villa beat Leeds United 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 extra time draw.\n\nThe ground first held international football on 10 May 1952, when England schools, captained by future York manager Wilf McGuinness, beat Ireland 5–0 before 16,000 spectators. It has hosted a number of youth international matches, most notably the England under-18's 4–0 win over Northern Ireland on 13 October 1996, in which 16-year-old Michael Owen scored a hat-trick for England. Bootham Crescent hosted three matches in the 2001 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, including France's 2–0 win over Russia in the quarter-final on 30 April 2001, watched by 557 spectators.\n\nThe ground has also held non-football events. It hosted a music concert in September 1979 and a grand fireworks display in October 1982 to celebrate the centenary of the \"Yorkshire Evening Press\". Sporting events to have taken place include an American football game in the summer of 1988, and a rugby league match between York and Leeds in the Challenge Cup before a crowd of 11,347 on 29 January 1989, which was won 28–9 by Leeds. York City Knights have played at Bootham Crescent since 2016, ahead of the move to the Community Stadium. The ground hosted baseball, an exhibition game in May 1934 and in 1937 the home fixtures of York City Maroons in the 8 team Yorkshire League. In August 2017, the ground was transformed into the 1936 Berlin Olympics stadium for filming a Bollywood film \"Gold\" (2018 film). Beer festivals, organised by the York Minstermen supporters' group, were held at the ground's social club from 2008 to 2012.\n\nThe highest attendance record at the ground was 28,123 for a match against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup sixth round on 5 March 1938. The highest attendance in the Football League is 21,010 against Hull City in the Third Division North on 23 April 1949. The attendance of 1,167 against Northampton Town on 5 May 1981 is the lowest ever to see York in a Football League match. York were relegated to the Conference National in 2004, and their highest home attendance in this division was 6,660 for a match against Morecambe on 4 May 2007. The lowest was 1,567 for a match against Exeter City on 10 March 2008. The lowest attendance at the ground for any first-team fixture was 608 for a Conference League Cup third-round match against Mansfield Town on 4 November 2008.\n\nThe highest seasonal average attendance for York at Bootham Crescent was 10,412 in 1948–49. York's lowest seasonal average was 2,139 in 1977–78, which came after two successive relegations from the Second Division. The most recent season in which the average attendance was more than 10,000 was in 1955–56. This season also saw York's highest total seasonal attendance at the ground, which was 236,685. The lowest total seasonal attendance was 48,357 for 1977–78 in the Fourth Division.\n\nYork's biggest margin of victory at Bootham Crescent was by eight goals, achieved with a 9–1 win over Southport in the Third Division North on 2 February 1957. Their biggest margin of defeat at the ground was by seven goals, when they were beaten 7–0 by Rochdale in a Third Division North match on 14 January 1939. The most goals scored in a match was 12 on 16 November 1935, when York defeated Mansfield Town 7–5 in the Third Division North.\n"}

In fiscal year (FY) 1920, Congress approved a conversion of collier into a ship designed for launching and recovering of airplanes at sea—the first aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. More aircraft carriers were approved and built, including , the first class of aircraft carriers in the United States Navy designed and built as aircraft carriers from the keel.\n\nThe United States declared war on Japan following the attack of December 7, 1941 on Pearl Harbor. The two nations revolutionized naval warfare in the course of the next four years; several of the most important sea battles were fought without either fleet coming within sight of the other. Most of the fleet carriers were built according to prewar designs, but the demand for air protection was so intense that two new classes were developed: light carriers (designated CVL), built on modified cruiser hulls, and escort carriers (CVE), whose main function was to protect Atlantic convoys from German U-boats.\n\nDuring the postwar period, carrier technology made many advances. The angled flight deck was adopted in 1955. The first \"supercarrier\" was commissioned in 1955 (although an earlier plan had been canceled by the Secretary of Defense), and the first nuclear-powered carrier in 1961, all during the Cold War. Also, a record for crossing the Pacific Ocean was set by a U.S. Navy carrier during the Korean War. Carriers recovered spacecraft after splashdown, including the Mercury-Redstone 3 and Apollo 11 missions.\n\nThe lead ship of a new class, the , was launched in 2013 and was commissioned in 2017. The last conventionally powered (non-nuclear) carrier was decommissioned.\nOn November 14, 1910, a 24‑year‑old civilian pilot, Eugene Burton Ely, took off in a 50 horsepower Curtiss plane from a wooden platform built over the bow of the cruiser ; later, on January 18, 1911, Ely landed a Curtiss Model D on a platform aboard . The Naval Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1920 provided funds for the conversion of into a ship designed for the launching and recovery of airplanes at sea—the United States Navy's first aircraft carrier. Renamed , she was commissioned in 1922. Commander Kenneth Whiting was placed in command. In 1924, \"Langley\" reported for duty with the Battle Fleet, ending two years as an experimental ship.\n\nIn 1922, Congress also authorized the conversion of the unfinished battlecruisers and the as permitted under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922. The keel of , the first American ship designed and constructed as an aircraft carrier, was laid down in 1931, and the ship was commissioned in 1934.\n\nFollowing \"Ranger\" and before the entry of the United States into World War II, four more carriers were commissioned. \nThe Imperial Japanese Navy struck Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but none of the Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers were in the harbor. Because a large fraction of the navy's battleship fleet was put out of commission by the attack, the undamaged aircraft carriers were forced to become the load-bearers of the early part of the war. The first aircraft carrier offensive of the U.S. Navy came on February 1, 1942, when the carriers Enterprise and Yorktown, attacked the Japanese bases in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. The Battle of the Coral Sea became the first sea battle in history in which neither opposing fleet saw the other. The Battle of Midway started as a Japanese offensive on Midway Atoll met by an outnumbered U.S. carrier force, and resulted in a U.S. victory. The Battle of Midway was the turning point in the Pacific War.\n\nIn 1943, new designations for carriers were established, limiting the CV designation to , , and the . The new designations were CVB (Aircraft carrier, large) for the carriers being built, and CVL (Aircraft carriers, small) for the class built on light cruiser hulls. The same directive reclassified escort carriers as combatant ships, and changed their symbol from ACV to CVE. By the end of the war, the Navy had access to around 100 carriers of varying sizes.\n\nOn September 2, 1945, Japan signed the surrender agreement aboard , ending World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States Navy purchased two Great Lakes side-wheel paddle steamers and converted them into freshwater aircraft carrier training ships. Both vessels were designated with the hull classification symbol IX and lacked hangar decks, elevators or armaments. The role of these ships was for the training of pilots for carrier take-offs and landings. Together \"Sable\" and \"Wolverine\" trained 17,820 pilots in 116,000 carrier landings.\n\nAircraft carrier technology underwent many changes during the Cold War. The first of the 45,000-ton carriers, was commissioned eight days after the end of World War II, on September 10. A larger ship was planned, and in 1948, President Harry Truman approved the construction of a \"supercarrier\", a 65,000-ton aircraft carrier to be named ; however, the project was canceled in April 1949 by the Secretary of Defense. The Navy's first supercarriers came later, in 1955, with the . 1953 saw the first test of an angled-deck carrier, .\n\nThe \"N\" suffix was added to the designation system to represent nuclear powered carriers in 1956. The first carrier to receive this suffix was , commissioned in 1961. The last conventionally powered carrier, , was commissioned in 1968 and was decommissioned in 2007.\n\nThe Korean War began June 25, 1950, and the need for planes and troops was urgent. Returning from Korea, made a record trip across the Pacific—7 days, 10 hours, and 36 minutes. In 1952, all carriers with designations \"CV\" or \"CVB\" were reclassified as attack carriers and given the sign \"CVA\".\n\nAs the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission ended, recovered Commander Alan B. Shepard, the first American in space, on May 5, 1961. Another aircraft carrier , recovered the Apollo 11 astronauts after their splashdown. Apollo 11 was the first manned landing mission to the moon, and was composed of astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins.\n\nIn 1975, the first was commissioned; the \"Nimitz\" class are the largest warships in the world; and is the only aircraft carrier class in commission with the U.S. Navy (except for , which, though still technically in commission as of August 2013, is currently being dismantled). Construction and commissioning of the \"Nimitz\" class continued after the Cold War.\n\nAlso, in 1975, the U.S. Navy simplified the carrier designations—CV, CVA, CVAN, CVB, CVL—into CV for conventionally powered carriers and CVN for nuclear-powered carriers.\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1991, the U.S. Navy had conventionally powered carriers from the , , and classes active, along with ; and the nuclear and ; however, all of the conventional carriers have been decommissioned. Construction of the \"Nimitz\"-class continued after the Cold War, and the last \"Nimitz\"-class carrier, , was commissioned in 2009.\n\nThe next class of supercarriers—the —launched the first ship in 2017. The new carriers will be stealthier, and feature A1B reactors, electromagnetic catapults, advanced arresting gear, reduced crew requirements, and a hull design based upon that of the \"Nimitz\" class. Ten carriers are planned for the \"Gerald R. Ford\" class.\nDuring World War II, the U.S. Navy built escort carriers in large numbers for patrol work, and scouting and escorting convoys. Escort carriers, based on merchant ship hulls, were smaller than aircraft carriers; escort carrier crews referred to the ships as \"Jeep carriers\", the press called them \"baby flat tops\". The escort carriers had lighter armor than aircraft carriers, were slower, had less defensive armament, and less aircraft capacity compared to aircraft carriers. This smaller variant of carriers was designated \"CVE\"; a common joke amongst crews was \"CVE\" meant \"Combustible, Vulnerable and Expendable\".\n\nEarly in the war, German submarines and aircraft were interfering with shipping. The worst losses occurred far at sea—out of the reach of land-based air forces—leading the Royal Navy to experiment with catapult-launching fighter aircraft from merchant ships, a somewhat successful approach. However, the number of planes was still limited, so the United Kingdom appealed to the United States for help.\n\nBefore World War II started, the U.S. Navy had contemplated converting merchant ships to small aircraft carriers for this purpose, so the quick solution was to build escort carriers on merchant ship hulls. The first escort carrier, , was converted from a freighter. A shortage of merchant ship hulls caused four escort carriers—, , , and —to be built on oil tanker hulls. In total, 78 escort carriers were built and launched from June 1941 to April 1945.\n"}

She served as co-anchor of the NBC news program \"Weekend Today\" from 2003 to 2007, and hosted the series \"Campbell Brown\" on CNN from 2008 to 2010. Brown won an Emmy Award as part of the NBC team reporting on Hurricane Katrina. Since 2013 she has been an education reform and school choice activist.\n\nCampbell Brown was born Alma Dale Campbell Brown in Ferriday, Louisiana, the daughter of the former Louisiana Democratic State Senator and Secretary of State James H. Brown Jr., and Brown's first wife, Dale Campbell. Alma Dale was her maternal grandmother's name.\n\nBrown was raised as a Roman Catholic, though her father is a Presbyterian. She has two sisters.\n\nBrown grew up in Ferriday, Louisiana, and attended the Trinity Episcopal Day School. Her family was involved in hunting, politics, and cooking, \"It was all about Cajun and tight-knit families and big parties,\" according to Brown.\n\nShe was expelled from the Madeira School for sneaking off campus to go to a party. Brown attended Louisiana State University for two years before graduating from Regis University. After graduation, she spent a year teaching English in Czechoslovakia. In her 2006 wedding announcement in The New York Times, she was described as having \"spent her postcollege years as a Colorado ski bum.\" \n\nShe began her career in local news reporting for KSNT-TV, the NBC affiliate in Topeka, Kansas, and then for WWBT-TV, the NBC affiliate in Richmond, Virginia, and also reported for WBAL-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, and WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. Brown joined NBC News in 1996. She was later assigned to The Pentagon and covered the war in Kosovo. Before \"Weekend Today,\" she was the White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nDuring the 2000 U.S. presidential election, she covered George W. Bush, the Republican National Convention, and Republican party primary elections. She became the main substitute anchor for Brian Williams on the \"NBC Nightly News\".\n\nIn March 2006, Brown was named as one of five women who might replace Katie Couric when she left the \"Today Show\". The position went to Meredith Vieira.\n\nBrown announced July 22, 2007, on \"Weekend Today\", that she would be leaving NBC News after eleven years to devote time to her family and expected baby. CNN confirmed it had hired Brown, and that Brown would start work for CNN in February 2008 (originally November 2007), filling the spot previously held by Paula Zahn, who left the network. Brown began anchoring , which ran from February through October 2008. The show was renamed \"\" in October 2008, shortly before the election in order to ensure a smooth transition when the election was over. Roland Martin filled in as guest host in April and May 2009 while Brown took maternity leave; when she returned in June 2009, the show was renamed again to simply \"Campbell Brown\".\n\nIn the face of low ratings, CNN released Brown from her contract. On May 18, 2010, Brown announced that she would be leaving CNN. She later told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that she had originally hoped that a straight news program like hers could compete successfully against the opinion-driven shows of her competitors, Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann. Olbermann responded by naming Brown as a runner-up in his daily “Worst Person In The World” segment.\n\nBrown's last day at CNN was on July 21, 2010. Beginning on July 22, her 8:00 p.m. prime time slot was filled by a second hour of Rick Sanchez's \"Rick's List\" TV program.\n\nAfter leaving CNN, Brown began writing opinion pieces for publications that included \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Daily Beast\" and \"Slate\". Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol proposed that Brown run for Charles Schumer's Senate seat.\n\nIn January 2017, Facebook announced that Brown would be joining to lead the company's news partnerships team. Her title is head of global new partnerships. In 2018, The Australian newspaper reported that Brown, in a private meeting with Facebook publishing partners, told the partners that their business models would die in a hospice unless they worked with Facebook.\n\nBrown has become an outspoken advocate for school choice and \"education reform\". In June 2013, Brown founded the Parents Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog group on behalf of parents seeking information and accountability from the teachers’ unions and New York Department of Education on actions impacting children in schools. The group, working with the \"New York Daily News\", investigated and reported on school employees who were accused of sexual misconduct with children but still kept their jobs.\n\nIn a January 2014 op-ed, Brown criticized teachers’ unions for failing to support a bill before Congress that would require more stringent background checks for teachers. Noting that 97 tenured New York City teachers or school employees had been charged with sexual misconduct during the previous five years, she complained that while ordinary employers would exhibit zero tolerance toward such offenders, New York law required an elaborate, expensive process that involves the participation of the teachers’ unions, which “prefer suspensions and fines, and not dismissal, for teachers charged with inappropriate sexual conduct.” United Federation of Teachers vice president Leo Carey disputed Brown's account of this process and its outcome, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed with Brown, saying that “maybe if you were a serial ax murderer, you might get a slap on the wrist.”\n\nIn April 2014, Brown launched the website CommonSenseContract.com, to influence New York City's contract talks with the United Federation of Teachers. Brown stated, \"We want the Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers to consider the views of parents.\"\n\nBrown has also focused on reforming teacher tenure policies through the judicial system. She wrote a number of op-eds voicing her support for the successful \"Vergara v. California\" case in 2014, which overturned California's teacher tenure, dismissal, and seniority policies. Brown called \"Vergara\" “the most important case you’ve never heard of”, and praised the plaintiffs’ efforts, saying they were “[taking] aim at laws that go directly to the heart of a good education: the ability to have, keep, and respect good teachers and dismiss utterly failing ones.” She celebrated Vergara as “A historic victory for America’s kids” and previewed the national ramifications of the ruling, saying, “It would be no surprise to see parents in New York and elsewhere take the cue of the Vergara plaintiffs and take matters into their own hands.”\n\nIn June 2014, Brown founded the non-profit organization Partnership for Educational Justice.\n\nIn its first major endeavor, Brown's group helped nine New York families organize and file a lawsuit against New York state, challenging the state's teacher tenure, teacher dismissal, and “Last In, First Out” seniority statutes. In \"Wright v. New York\", filed in New York City on July 28, 2014, the plaintiffs claim that these teacher tenure, dismissal, and seniority policies violated their children's state constitutional right to a “sound basic education”. Brown said she hoped that taking the issue of teacher tenure reform to the courts would “force a new legislative process” around New York's tenure policies.\n\nIn September 2014, the case was consolidated with another lawsuit challenging New York tenure laws, and now is in litigation as \"Davids v. New York\". The case is ongoing.\n\nIn May 2016, the Partnership for Educational Justice became involved in a lawsuit against Minnesota Education Commissioner Brenda Cassellius, Governor Mark Dayton, the Minnesota Department of Education and the state of Minnesota, stemming from a teacher tenure dispute in the Anoka-Hennepin School District which claims in part that Minnesota's Continuing Contract Law and Tenure Act, in particular its \"last in, first out\" layoff rules, is unconstitutional on the grounds that it denies students a \"'uniform' and 'thorough' education\".\n\nIn July 2015, Brown co-founded The 74, a non-profit, non-partisan news site covering education in America; it gets its name from the fact that there are roughly 74 million children under the age of 18 in the United States.\n\nIn 2017 she was made the head of global news partnerships at Facebook.\n\nBrown also serves on the boards of Success Academy Charter Schools, a New York City charter school network; Turnaround for Children, a nonprofit organization that addresses the emotional effects of poverty on children's learning environments; and the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF).\n\nOn April 2, 2006, Brown married Daniel Samuel Senor, the former chief spokesperson for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. They had met in Iraq in March 2004, when Senor was spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad and Brown was one of the journalists covering his daily news conferences. After Senor returned to Washington in 2004, Brown called him. \"I was wildly, wildly curious about his experience in Iraq,\" she later said. According to the \"New York Times\", \"their first date was a group dinner, with Tom Brokaw and another journalist.\" Senor and Brown married at the Beaver Creek Chapel in Beaver Creek, Colorado. Brown converted to Judaism, her husband's faith. Brown had been married before, briefly, to a Washington, D.C., real estate broker. That marriage ended in divorce.\n\nOn June 24, 2007, Brown announced on \"Weekend Today\" that she and her husband were expecting their first baby. On December 18, 2007, Brown gave birth to their son, Eli James Senor, named after his grandfather, James Senor.\n\nIn an August 2008 article, Brown addressed charges that her marriage to Senor, who at the time was working as an advisor for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign, represented a conflict of interest for her as a journalist. Brown noted that such marriages were commonplace in Washington, with NBC reporters Chuck Todd and Andrea Mitchell married to a Democratic consultant and Alan Greenspan, respectively.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, during a guest appearance on \"The Daily Show\", Brown announced her second pregnancy. On April 6, 2009, Brown gave birth to her second son, Asher Liam Senor.\n\nIn 2012, Brown performed as a \"broadcast journalist\" in the play \"8\".\n\nBrown was portrayed by the actress and comedian Tracey Ullman in her Showtime comedy series \"Tracey Ullman's State of the Union\", and by Kristen Wiig on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\n"}

He was initially less successful after leaving Villa Park in September 1979 to sign for Villa's local rivals West Bromwich Albion, managing just five goals from 47 league games over the next two years, but recaptured his form after joining Norwich City in December 1981 and helping them seal promotion to the First Division that season. He scored 20 league goals in his first full season at Carrow Road and managed 15 and 13 goals over the next two seasons, although he was unable to save the Canaries from relegation in 1984–85. He also helped them win the Football League Cup in 1985 and the Second Division title - and a return to the First Division as Second Division champions a year later.\n\nIn 2002, Norwich fans voted Deehan into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in recognition of his contribution as a player.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, he left Norwich to join Ipswich Town in a player exchange deal that saw Trevor Putney move to Carrow Road. His final season at Norwich had seen him collected a Second Division title medal, but his form was less impressive than in previous seasons with just four goals from 26 league games.\n\nFrom 1988 until 1990 he was player-coach at Manchester City, where he worked under the management of former Norwich assistant Mel Machin, before returning to Norwich City as Mike Walker's assistant in the summer of 1992.\n\nHe helped coach an unfancied Canaries side to a surprise third-place finish in the inaugural FA Premier League (season 1992-93), and was promoted to the manager's seat the following January when Walker moved to Everton. Norwich finished 12th in the Premiership in 1993-94 and started the following season reasonably well despite the (then) record English sale of Chris Sutton to Blackburn Rovers for £5 million. Despite the loss of Sutton, and the sale of Efan Ekoku shortly afterwards, the Canaries were seventh in the Premiership by Christmas and were in contention for a UEFA Cup place. An injury to goalkeeper Bryan Gunn then sparked a dramatic loss of form, and by the time the Canaries lost 3-0 to Newcastle United on 8 April 1995, they were heading for the relegation zone. Deehan then stepped down as manager and handed the reins to his assistant Gary Megson, but Megson was unable to stave off relegation.\n\nDeehan's absence from football did not last long. He began the 1995–96 season as manager of Wigan Athletic in the Football League Third Division, and after two seasons at the helm he guided them to the Division Three title and promotion to Division Two. After safeguarding Wigan's survival in 1997–98, he accepted the assistant manager's job at Sheffield United and for one season worked under Steve Bruce. Deehan's time at Bramall Lane was unsuccessful and he resigned after the club failed to get near the Division One playoff places.\n\nAfter leaving Sheffield United, Deehan worked again with Steve Bruce at Huddersfield Town, in the 1999–2000 season. After leaving the Yorkshire club, he made a football comeback with Aston Villa when he was appointed assistant manager to John Gregory in July 2001. In January 2002, Deehan was named joint caretaker manager of Villa (with Stuart Gray) when Gregory resigned. He left the club when Graham Taylor was named Villa manager for the second time.\n\nIn October 2003, Deehan became Director of Football at Northampton Town, with Colin Calderwood working under him as team manager. The duo were appointed to get the team promoted from the league's basement division, and achieved this aim in the 2005-06 season. Both Calderwood and Deehan left the club at the end of the 2005–06 season, with Deehan moving to Lincoln City as Director of Football. On 15 October 2007, it was confirmed that Deehan and Lincoln City manager John Schofield had left the club. In November 2007, Deehan was employed as a scout by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers who were looking for a number of former professionals to head their recruitment drive led by former Everton manager Colin Harvey.\n\nIn September 2008, Deehan expressed interest in the vacant manager's post at League Two side Grimsby Town, saying: \"I think Grimsby Town is a good club and a good opportunity for any manager. Whenever I've been to Blundell Park, I've been impressed with the set-up and the positive approach to football.\" Despite his interest Deehan failed to land the Grimsby job, which was given to Mike Newell.\n\nOn 21 January 2009, he was appointed as Chief Scout of Norwich City Football Club in part of the new management team alongside three of his former players – Bryan Gunn as First Team Manager, Ian Crook as first team coach and Ian Butterworth as Assistant Manager.\n\nIn December 2009, Deehan became Lee Harper's assistant at Kettering Town but was controversially sacked later that month immediately following a 5–1 defeat to Leeds United in an FA Cup second-round replay where his choice of substitutions during extra time were blamed for the defeat.\n\nOn 17 March 2010, he was announced as Head of Recruitment (Director of Football) at Grimsby Town in order to work with manager Neil Woods and his assistant Chris Casper. It was touted that Deeham would be a possible replacement for Woods if the club are relegated from the Football League. However, after the conclusion of the 09/10 season, which eventually brought relegation Deehan's contract was not renewed and he left the club 20 May 2010.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, Deehan was appointed Director of Football at Plymouth Argyle. At the end of the 2012-2013 season he left the club. He teamed up with Stuart Gray again early in 2014, joining the coaching staff at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\n"}

{"id": "2067852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067852", "title": "Pillar of the Boatmen", "text": "Pillar of the Boatmen\n\nThe Pillar of the Boatmen () is a monumental Roman column erected in Lutetia (modern Paris) in honour of Jupiter by the guild of boatmen in the 1st century AD. It is the oldest monument in Paris and is one of the earliest pieces of representational Gallo-Roman art to carry a written inscription .\n\nIt was found re-used in the 4th century city wall on the Île de la Cité and is now displayed in the frigidarium of the Thermes de Cluny.\n\nThe pillar is made of a type of limestone called \"pierre de Saint-Leu-d'Esserent\", from Saint-Leu, Oise, France. The original pillar would have been 5.24m high, 91cm wide at the base and 74cm wide at the top (Saragoza 2003). It is likely to have been formed in four tiers and although the order from top to bottom is reasonably certain from the relative sizes of the blocks, we do not know the rotational order in which the blocks were arranged; there are 64 possibilities.\n\nHowever, there is no proof that they were stacked and could also have been two pairs of altars.\n\nThe guild was for relatively wealthy shipowners or traders. An indication of the power of the guild is shown by one of the sculptures of the pillar where they parade in arms with shields and spears, a privilege granted by the Romans, which is exceptional in less than half a century after the conquest of Gaul. The guild was also the first known society of Paris. \n\nWritten in Latin with some Gaulish language features, the inscription mingles Roman deities with gods that are distinctly Gallic. The pillar is dated by a dedication to \"Tiberius Caesar Augustus\", that is Tiberius who became emperor in 14 AD. It was set up publicly \"(publice posierunt)\" by the guild of sailors of Lutetia, from the \"civitas\" of the Parisii \"(nautae Parisiaci)\". These sailors would have been merchants who travelled along the Seine.\n\nThe main dedication is to Jupiter in the form of \"Iovis Optimus Maximus\" (\"Jove Best and Greatest\"). The names of the emperor and the supreme deity appear in the dative case as the recipients of the dedication. The remaining theonyms are nominative legends that accompany individual depictions of the gods. These are (in the order they appear below) Jove, Tarvos Trigaranos (the Bull with three Cranes), Volcanus (Vulcan), Esus, Cernunnos, Castor, Smertrios, and Fortuna.\n\nThe dedication (; \"RIG\" L2-1) is as follows:\n\nThe pillar provides the only undisputed instance of the divine name \"Cernunnos\" . The Gaulish theonyms are presented as deity names in their own right, and not as epithets for Roman gods (by contrast, see the many Celtic gods syncretized with Mars). Other figures appear on the pillar without legible inscriptions, including the Roman gods Mars and Mercury, who can be identified by their conventional iconography, and other unidentified figures, mainly female.\n\nThe top tier, of which only the top half remains, depicts Cernunnos, Smertrios, and Castor and Pollux. Cernunnos has stag's antlers from which hang two torcs. From the amount of the body in the top half, Cernunnos is assumed to have been depicted in a cross-legged seated position as is typical of other Cernunnos depictions ; there is insufficient room for him to be seated on a chair or standing . Smertrios is shown kneeling, brandishing a club and attacking a snake. Castor and Pollux are shown standing beside their horses, each holding a spear .\n\nThe second tier, which is complete, shows Jupiter, Esus, Tarvos Trigaranos and Vulcan. Jupiter is shown standing, holding a spear and a thunderbolt. Esus is shown standing beside a willow tree, which he is cutting down with an axe. Tarvos Trigaranus is depicted as a large, heavy-set bull standing in front of a willow tree. Two cranes stand on his back and a third on his head. Vulcan is shown standing, with hammer and tongs .\n\nThe third tier, the top half of which survives, bears the main dedicatory inscription on one face. Since this has a border and appears complete, the content of the bottom half of this face is unknown. The other sides show a group of three young men with shields and spears; a group of three older, bearded men with spears and shields, bearing the inscription \"Iurises\"; and a group of three figures, at least one of which is female. They are unarmed, dressed in flowing gowns, and have an inscription \"Senani U[s]eiloni\" .\n\nThe fourth, lowest tier is slightly wider than the upper three. Only the top half remains, and the inscriptions are badly damaged. Each face shows a pair of standing figures. Mars, with spear and sword, is accompanied by a female deity with large round ear-rings and a flowing garment which is held over one arm. Mercury, identifiable by his caduceus, is depicted with a goddess who may be Rosmerta, his frequent companion in Gallic art. Fortuna is accompanied by another female deity, perhaps Juno. Two other unidentified female deities are on the fourth face, the one to the left is naked to the waist and holds a large cloak behind her with upraised arms; the other is clothed and has large round ear-rings .\n\nSome time in the 3rd century, the stone blocks that formed the pillar were broken into two and used to reinforce the foundations of the walls along the riverbank. Over time, the island grew slightly so that the 3rd-century wharfs are now a dozen metres from the banks of the modern river .\n\nThe Christian cathedral of St. Etienne was founded by Childebert in 528 AD on the site of the Gallo-Roman temple; Notre-Dame de Paris was in turn built over this in 1163 AD.\n\nThe pillar was found on 6 March 1710 during the construction of a crypt under the nave of Notre-Dame de Paris and first published by Baudelot de Dairval in 1712 . Not all of the pieces were recovered; for three of the tiers we have only the top half.\n\nAfter discovery, the stone blocks were taken to the Hôtel de Cluny, a medieval ecclesiastical building constructed over the remains of a 2nd-century Roman bath house. This became the \"Musée de Cluny\" and then, the \"Musée national du Moyen Age\".\n\nIn 2001, the blocks were restored, removing the black patina of grime that had accumulated on the surface of the stone over the three centuries since discovery . The restored stones are once again on display in the museum.\n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1876.\n\nWhen Buxton was appointed governor, the Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston was angry that the South Australian government had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's invalid carriage). Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor.

{"id": "2067868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067868", "title": "Prothesis (linguistics)", "text": "Prothesis (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, prothesis (; from post-classical Latin based on ' 'placing before'), or less commonly prosthesis (from Ancient Greek ' 'addition') is the addition of a sound or syllable at the beginning of a word without changing the word's meaning or the rest of its structure. A vowel or consonant added by prothesis is called prothetic or prosthetic.\n\nProthesis is different from the adding of a prefix, which changes the meaning of a word.\n\nProthesis is a metaplasm, a change in spelling or pronunciation. The opposite process, the loss of a sound from the beginning of a word, is called apheresis or aphesis.\n\nProthesis may occur during word formation from\nborrowing from foreign languages or the derivation from protolanguages.\n\nA well-known example is that + stop clusters (known as '), in Latin, gained a preceding in early Romance languages (Old Spanish, Old French).\n\nThus, Latin ' changed to Spanish and French , (in which the \"s\" was later lost) \"state\"/\"been\", and Latin ' changed to Spanish and Old French ' (Modern French ' and Italian \"speciale\").\n\nSome Turkic languages avoid certain combinations of consonants at the beginning of a word. In Turkish, for instance, Smyrna is called İzmir, and the word , borrowed from French, becomes Turkish .\n\nSimilarly, in Bashkir, a prosthetic vowel is added to Russian loanwords if a consonant or a consonant cluster appears at the beginning: \"rye\" from Russian , \"table\" from Russian , \"bench\" from Russian , etc.\n\nHowever, Bashkir presents cases of novel prothesis in terms that are inherited from Old Turkic: \"falcon\" from Old Turkic \"lačïn\", \"dew\" from Old Turkic \"čïq\".\n\nIn Nenets, Enets and Nganasan, prothesis of a velar nasal before vowels has occurred historically: the Nenets words \"road\", \"bow\" are cognate with Hungarian \"út\", \"íj\" with the same meaning.\n\nIn some varieties of Nenets, the rule remains productive: the initial syllable cannot start with a vowel, and vowel-initial loanwords are adapted with prothetic .\n\nHindi words from English have an initial \"i\" before \"sp-\", \"sk-\" or \"sm-\": school → \"iskuul\", special → \"ispesal\".\n\nIn Persian, loanwords with an initial \"sp-\", \"st-\", \"sk-\" or \"sm-\" add a short vowel \"e\" at the beginning: spray → \"esprey\", stadium → \"estadiun\", Stalin → \"Estalin\", skate → \"eskeyt\", scan → \"eskan\" etc.\n\nPersians learning Polish thus pronounce \"smacznego\" (\"bon appétit\") as \"esmacznego\".\n\nDuring the evolution from Proto-Slavic, words in various Slavic languages gained prosthetic consonants: Russian \"okno\" (\"window\") vs. Ukrainian \"vikno\" or Belarusian \"vakno\".\n\nAlso, Polish \"wątroba\" (\"liver\") and Russian \"utroba\" changed from Proto-Slavic \"ǫtroba\".\n\nSemitic languages regularly break up initial two-consonant clusters by adding a prothetic vowel. The vowel may be preceded by the glottal stop /ʔ/ (see aleph) or, in Hebrew, /h/, which may be pronounced or simply written. Because of the triconsonantal root morphology of Semitic languages, the prosthetic vowel may appear regularly when the first two consonants of the root lack an intermediate vowel, such as in verb conjugation; Arabic \"ʼaktubu\" (I write) from the verb \"kataba\" (root \"ktb\").\n\nWelsh sometimes features \"h-prothesis\" only for vowel-initial words. It occurs in words after ' (her), ' (our) and ' (their): ' (age) ' (her age). It also occurs with ' (twenty) following \"ar\" (on) in the traditional counting system: \"\" \"one on twenty\" (twenty-one).\n\nSwiss German features \"n-prothesis\" if a word ends with a vowel and the next word begins with a vowel. A dropped final \"n\" was originally retained then, but the process now occurs in contexts where \"n\" never existed. A similar process called intrusive-r occurs in some varieties of English.\n\nA prothetic vowel performs external sandhi in Italian: compare ' (\"the school\") vs. ' (\"at school\"). It is, therefore, conjectured both that the origins of the Romance prothesis are phonetical, rather than grammatical. Prothesis originally broke consonant clusters if the preceding word ended in a consonant. There was no prothesis in the Romance dialects that had lost their terminal consonants.\n\nPhonetic rules of a native language may influence the pronunciation of a second language, including various metaplasms. For example, prothesis is reported for Crimean Tatars when they speak Russian.\n\nJames L. Barker writes: \"If an Arab, an East Indian, a Frenchman, Spaniard, or Italian is given the following sentence to read: \"I want to speak Spanish\", he reads it in the following manner: \"I want to speak (i)/(e)Spanish\". In this case there is no 'parasitic' \"i\" or \"e\" before \"sp\" of \"speak\", but there is before \"sp\" in \"Spanish\"\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2067874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067874", "title": "Gabriel Báthory", "text": "Gabriel Báthory\n\nGabriel Báthory (; 15 August 1589 – 27 October 1613) was Prince of Transylvania from 1608 to 1613. Born to the Roman Catholic branch of the Báthory family, he was closely related to four rulers of the Principality of Transylvania (a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire which had developed in the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary). His father, Stephen Báthory, held estates in the principality, but never ruled it. Being a minor when his father died in 1601, Gabriel became the ward of the childless Stephen Báthory, from the Protestant branch of the family, who converted him to Calvinism. After inheriting his guardian's most estates in 1605, Gabriel became one of the wealthiest landowners in Transylvania and Royal Hungary (a realm of the Habsburg Empire which included the northern and western parts of medieval Hungary).\n\nGabriel made an alliance with the Hajdúsirregular troops stationing along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungaryand laid claim to Transylvania against the elderly prince, Sigismund Rákóczi in February 1608. Rákóczi abdicated and the Diet of Transylvania elected Gabriel prince without resistance. Both the Sublime Porte and the Habsburg ruler Matthias II acknowledged Gabriel's election. He ignored the privileges of the Transylvanian Saxons and captured their wealthiest town, Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), provoking an uprising in 1610. His attempts to expand his authority over the Ottoman vassal Wallachia and his negotiations with Matthias II outraged the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I. The Sultan decided to replace Gabriel with an exiled Transylvanian nobleman, Gabriel Bethlen, and sent troops to invade the principality in August 1613. Transylvania was unable to resist and the Diet dethroned Gabriel. He was murdered by Hajdú assassins.\n\nBáthory was born in Várad (now Oradea in Romania) before dawn on 15 August 1589. His father, Stephen Báthory, was a cousin of Prince of Transylvania Sigismund Báthory. Stephen was captain of Várad when Gabriel was born. Gabriel's mother was his father's first wife, Zsuzsanna Bebek. Although she had already given birth to four children, none survived infancy. Sigismund Báthory dismissed Gabriel's father from Várad in the summer of 1592, and Gabriel's family then moved to the Báthorys' ancient castle in Szilágysomlyó (now Șimleu Silvaniei in Romania).\n\nThe Principality of Transylvania emerged after the disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 1540s. The principality included the eastern and northeastern regions of the medieval kingdom and its princes paid a yearly tribute to the Ottoman sultans. The princes were elected by the Diet, but they were to seek the Ottoman sultans' confirmation to rule the principality. The Habsburg kings of Royal Hungary regarded the principality as a part of their realm and the first rulers of the principality acknowledged the Habsburgs' claim in secret treaties in the 1570s. The Diet of Transylvania consisted primarily of the representatives of the Three Nations (that is the Hungarian noblemen, the Saxon burghers and the Székelys).\n\nSigismund Báthory, who was a devout Catholic, wanted to join the Holy League of Pope Clement VIII against the Ottoman Empire, but most Transylvanian noblemen opposed his plan. Stephen Báthory's brother, Balthasar, was an opposition leader. Balthasar was captured and murdered at Sigismund's order in late August 1594. Gabriel's father fled from Transylvania to Poland, leaving his family behind in Szilágysomlyó; the five-year-old Gabriel was imprisoned with his mother and newborn sister, Anna. Stephen and Balthasar's brother, Cardinal Andrew Báthory (who lived in Poland), persuaded Pope Clement VIII to intervene on their behalf. Gabriel, his mother and sister were freed at the pope's request and were allowed to join Stephen in Poland. His mother became seriously ill, and died near the end of 1595.\n\nThe Ottomans routed the armies of the Holy League in a series of battles after 1595. Sigismund Báthory abdicated in favor of Gabriel's uncle, Andrew, in early 1599 in the hope that Andrew could regain the Ottoman sultans' favor with Polish mediation. Gabriel's father accompanied Andrew back to Transylvania, and his family followed him. Michael the Brave, Prince of Wallachia, who had joined the Holy League, invaded Transylvania and defeated Andrew with the assistance of Székely troops. After Székely commoners murdered Andrew, Michael the Brave took possession of Transylvania. Gabriel's father fled to Kővár (now Remetea Chioarului in Romania) and swore fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph (who was also king of Hungary), before his death on 21 February 1601.\n\nThe orphaned Gabriel and Anna were placed in the guardianship of their father's childless cousin, Stephen Báthory, and lost most of their father's estates; Szilágysomlyó was seized by the royal treasury, and their scattered estates in Szatmár, Szabolcs and Kraszna Counties were seized by a distant cousin, Peter Szaniszlófi. Scholar János Czeglédi educated Gabriel in Nagyecsed, and the wealthy Stephen Báthory converted Gabriel from Catholicism to Calvinism. Gabriel pledged that he would expel Catholics, Lutherans and Unitarians from his estates. The young Gabriel's strength was legendary, and he was said to break horseshoes with his bare hands.\n\nRudolf's troops occupied Transylvania in 1603 and his officials started to confiscate the estates of noblemen through legal proceedings on false charges of treason. One of the wealthiest landowners, Stephen Bocskai, was accused of maintaining secret correspondence with Transylvanian exiles in 1604. To avoid imprisonment, he rose up in open rebellion with the backing of the Hajdú, irregular troops stationed along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungary. Although Stephen Báthory did not openly support Bocskai, he sent Gabriel to Bocskai's court in Kassa. Sixteen-year-old Gabriel participated in a battle against the royal army near Sárospatak in early February 1605; three years later, poet János Rimay accused him of fleeing the battlefield. Rimay also said that Gabriel spent his days mainly drinking wine and allegedly had an affair with his aunt, Kata Iffjú (who was over thirty years old at the time).\n\nBocskai was elected prince of Transylvania on 21 February 1605 and prince of Hungary on 20 April of that year. His realm included most of Transylvania proper, Partium and Upper Hungary. Stephen Báthory died on 25 July 1605. He had willed most of his estates to Gabriel, who became one of the wealthiest noblemen in Bocskai's realm. Bocskai hinted that he regarded Gabriel as his successor, ordering Bálint Drugeth (commander-in-chief of his army in Upper Hungary) to \"hold Gabriel Báthory in the highest esteem among the Hungarian lords\" if he did not return from his meeting with Ottoman Grand Vizier Lala Mehmed Pasha in November 1605. Young noblemen (including Gabriel's future enemy, Gabriel Bethlen) and military officials also supported Gabriel. Years later, Gáspár Bojti Veres wrote that Gabriel hosted feasts to win popularity with Bocskai's courtiers and commanders. Gabriel's relatives, Mihály Káthay (Bocskai's chancellor) and János Imreffy (Kata Iffjú's husband), were his principal supporters. His position weakened after Bocskai who was taken ill suddenly had Káthay imprisoned for treason in early September 1606. Káthay's opponents, Simon Péchi and János Rimay, persuaded the dying (and often unconscious) Bocskai to name Bálint Drugeth his successor in his last will.\n\nBocskai died in Kassa on 29 December 1606. A mob accused Káthay of poisoning Bocskai, and lynched him on 12 January 1607. Gabriel had demanded the Principality of Transylvania in a 2 January 1607 letter to the grand vizier, Kuyucu Murad Pasha. Bocskai's deputy, the elderly Sigismund Rákóczi, continued to administer the principality with the consent of the Diet of Transylvania. Gabriel sent Bethlen to Székely captain János Petki to secure his support, but Bethlen was imprisoned at Rákóczi's order on 26 January. Rákóczi also dismissed Várad captain Dénes Bánffy, the fiancé of Gabriel's sister Anna.\n\nThe delegates of the Three Nations of Transylvania wanted to demonstrate their right to freely elect the prince. The Diet first passed a decree prohibiting a minor from being elected prince, preventing Gabriel's election. It ignored Bocskai's last will, electing Rákóczi prince on 12 February. Gabriel mustered troops, saying that he only wanted to protect Transylvania. He demanded the cancellation of the Transylvanian decrees ordering the confiscation of his father and uncles' estates in 1595. Gabriel approached Rudolph I's councillors after the Diet expelled the Jesuits from Transylvania, offering to defend the Catholic Church in the principality if he ascended the throne and saying that he was ready to reconvert to Catholicism. Rudolph made him governor of Transylvania in June, but the appointment had no real effect on Gabriel's position. Gabriel married Bocskai's kinswoman, Anna Horváth Palocsai, about two months later.\n\nAfter being unpaid for months, the Hajdús rose up in the autumn of 1607. They offered their support to Drugeth, who refused to lead them. Gabriel also treated them with disdain and promised to protect Transylvania against them at the end of October. He soon mustered his troops and marched to Upper Hungary. He again approached the royal court, asking Rudolph to make him voivode of Transylvania. After the representatives of the Hajdús and the noblemen of Upper Hungary made a fifty-day truce in Ináncs at the end of the year, Gabriel began negotiations with the Hajdús. They concluded a treaty on 8 February 1608. Gabriel pledged to grant villages to the Hajdús in Partium, and they promised to support him in seizing Transylvania. He also promised to expel \"heretics and idolaters\" (Unitarians and Catholics) from the royal council. According to the contemporary Ferenc Nagy Szabó's memoirs, the Ottoman grand vizier soon decided to support Gabriel.\n\nGabriel sent Imreffy to Rákóczi, offering to help Rákóczi seize two important domains in Upper Hungary if Rákóczi abdicated. He informed Rudolph's commissioner, Zsigmond Forgách, on 13 February 1608 that Rákóczi had already agreed to leave Transylvania. Although the Hajdús took control of the northwestern region of Partium, Gabriel forbade them to invade Transylvania proper. János Petki announced Rákóczi's abdication at the Diet in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 5 March of that year.\n\nThe Diet elected Gabriel prince on 7 March 1608, and sent delegates to him in Nagyecsed. Although his election was technically free, he controlled the strongest army in the principality (making resistance impossible). He pledged to respect the laws of the principality, especially the privileges of the Three Nations, before accepting his election on 14 March. Gabriel was ceremoniously installed in Kolozsvár on 31 March, and the Diet granted him the domains of Fogaras (now Făgăraș in Romania) and Kővár as hereditary estates. He began settling the Hajdús in Partium, and granted Böszörmény to those forced to leave Nagykálló; others received parcels in Bihar County. About 30,000 Hajdú soldiers received parcels of land from Gabriel during his reign.\n\nTo assert his suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia, he decided to dethrone Prince Radu Șerban of Wallachia; however, the royal council and Michael Weiss (mayor of the important Transylvanian Saxon town of Brassó, now Brașov in Romania) dissuaded him. Radu Șerban voluntarily swore fealty to Gabriel in the presence of his envoys on 31 May. On 18 July, thirteen-year-old Prince of Moldavia Constantin I Movilă also acknowledged Gabriel's suzerainty and promised to pay a yearly tribute of 8,000 florins. That month, Gabriel visited Brassó. His feasts infuriated the burghers, who called him a drunkard or a greedy new Sardanapalus in defamatory poems. Gabriel's promiscuity was notorious; he reportedly seduced young women and promoted noblemen who were willing to offer him their wives.\n\nHe sent Bethlen to Istanbul and Imreffy to Kassa to secure his recognition by the Sublime Porte and the royal court. After a brief negotiation, Imreffy and representatives of Rudolph's brother Matthias (who had persuaded Rudolph to abdicate in his favor) signed two treaties on 20 August. The first treaty summarized the privileges of the Hajdús in Royal Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania. The second recognized Gabriel as lawful ruler of Transylvania, but forbade him to secede from the Holy Crown of Hungary. Bethlen returned from Istanbul in late November with the sultan's delegates, who brought the \"ahidnâme\" confirming Gabriel's election. The sultan exempted Transylvania from paying the customary tribute for three years.\n\nRomanian Orthodox priests approached Gabriel for support against noblemen who treated them like serfs. At their request, he freed them from taxation and service demands by the landowners in June 1609. Gabriel also granted them the right to freely move about the principality. At his initiative, in October the Diet abolished all grants which had exempted some noble estates from taxation.\n\nWhile Gabriel was sleeping at István Kendi's home in Szék (now Sic in Romania) during the night of 10–11 March 1610, a man entered his bedroom. Although the intruder had wanted to stab Gabriel, he changed his mind and confessed that Kendi and other (mostly-Catholic) noblemen had hired him. Kendi soon fled to Royal Hungary, but his accomplices were captured. The Diet sentenced the conspirators to death on 24 March, and their estates were confiscated. Gabriel made Imreffy chancellor and Bethlen captain of the Székelys.\n\nThe motivation for the conspiracy is unclear. According to the contemporary Tamás Borsos, the conspirators wanted to murder Gabriel because his undisciplined Hajdú troops had destroyed many villages. Calvinist pastor Máté Szepsi Laczkó said that the Catholic noblemen wanted to get rid of the Protestant prince. Others claimed that Boldizsár Kornis (captain of the Székelys) joined the plot because Gabriel had tried to seduce his young wife.\n\nGabriel met Palatine of Hungary György Thurzó in Királydaróc (now Craidorolț in Romania) in June, but they could not reach an agreement. He said during the negotiations that he was a sovereign, but the palatine was merely a \"lord's serf\". After returning to Transylvania, Gabriel planned to reunite Royal Hungary and Transylvania under his rule with Ottoman support. Although he ordered the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia to send reinforcements and the Saxons to pay a tax of 100,000 florins, the prince of Moldavia did not send troops and the Saxons paid only 10,000 florins. Imreffy again went to Royal Hungary to negotiate with Thurzó in Kassa. By 15 August, they reached a compromise which resolved most of the contentious issues. However, Matthias II did not ratify the agreement because it stated that Transylvania was not required to provide military assistance to Royal Hungary against the Ottomans.\n\nGabriel went to Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), the wealthiest Saxon town, on 10 December. Although only 50 soldiers accompanied him into the town, his army was stationed on the outskirts. Gabriel stopped at the gate of the town the following day, pretending that he only wanted to study it; while the gate was open, his army unexpectedly marched in and captured the town without resistance. He said that he wanted to secure his entry into Szeben because the Saxons could refuse monarchs entry into their towns. According to the contemporaneous Diego de Estrada, Gabriel wanted to transfer his capital to Szeben from Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania), which had been destroyed during the Long Turkish War. The Diet declared Szeben capital of the principality on 17 December, limiting its privileges, authorizing noblemen to acquire real estate and Calvinist priests to preach in the town's Lutheran churches.\n\nGabriel launched a military campaign against Wallachia on 26 December. Radu Şerban fled the country, enabling Gabriel to take possession of Târgoviște without resistance. Gabriel styled himself prince of Wallachia in a 26 January 1611 charter. According to Radu Popescu's chronicle, his troops brought pillage, destruction and death to the countryside. Gabriel sent his envoys to Istanbul, asking Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I to confirm his rule in Wallachia. He outlined a plan for the conquest of Poland. He also demanded compensation for the salaries of his Hajdús from the Ottomans, who began to call him \"\"Deli Kiral\"\" (Mad King) because of his actions.\n\nThe Ottoman governors of Buda and Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) invaded the Hajdú villages in Partium, forcing them to hurry back and defend their homes. Ahmed I granted Wallachia to Radu Mihnea and ordered Gabriel to return to Transylvania in March. Although the sultan's decision outraged Gabriel, he had no choice but to accept it. Radu Şerban ousted Radu Mihnea from Wallachia at the head of an army of Cossack and Moldavian mercenaries. The Diet ordered the mobilization of the Transylvanian army, authorizing Gabriel to collect an extraordinary tax in April. However, Michael Weiss (who had regarded Gabriel as a new Nero) incited the burghers of Brassó to rise up against the monarch. Gabriel dispatched Hajdú captain András Nagy to lay siege to Brassó, but Weiss bribed Nagy to lift the siege. Radu Şerban invaded Burzenland (now Țara Bârsei in Romania) unexpectedly, and routed Gabriel's army near Brassó on 8 July 1611. Gabriel barely escaped from the battlefield to Szeben.\n\nMatthias II considered Gabriel's attack against Wallachia as treachery, because he regarded Transylvania and the two Romanian principalities as realms of the Hungarian Crown. Zsigmond Forgách, commander-in-chief of Upper Hungary, invaded Transylvania in late June. Although Nagy and the Hajdús under his command supported Forgách, most Protestant noblemen refused to join the invasion. Most Transylvanians regarded the invasion as an unlawful action, and only the Saxons were willing to support Forgách. He and Radu Şerban besieged Szeben, but could not capture it. Gabriel sent envoys to Istanbul, seeking assistance from the Sublime Porte. Nagy and his Hajdú troops deserted Forgách and routed the reinforcements sent to him from Upper Hungary in mid-September. After learning of the arrival of Ottoman troops to support Gabriel, Radu Şerban withdrew from Szeben; this forced Forgách to lift the siege. The Transylvanian army routed the retreating royal troops, capturing hundreds of soldiers.\n\nGabriel led his army from Szeben to Várad, but the Ottoman troops did not accompany him. Delegates of the counties and towns of Upper Hungary persuaded Thurzó to begin negotiations with Gabriel, and their envoys signed an agreement in Tokaj in December. Gabriel pledged to send delegates to the Diet of Hungary and not allow serfs to join the Hajdús. However, the princes of the Holy Roman Empire persuaded Matthias II not to ratify the treaty until Gabriel reached an agreement with the Saxons.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabriel sent Hajdú captain András Géczi to Istanbul to express his gratitude for Ottoman support. Géczi made an agreement with Michael Weiss in Brassó, however, and asked for Gabriel's removal on behalf of the Three Nations of Transylvania in Istanbul in November. The Imperial Council of the Ottoman Empire accepted the proposal, and decided to replace Gabriel with Géczi. After the burghers of Brassó refused to surrender, Gabriel invaded Burzenland and captured seven Saxon fortresses in late March and early April 1612. The Diet of Transylvania urged the Saxons of Brassó to surrender in May, but the Three Nations delegates did not punish the noblemen who had fled to the town. Gabriel proposed a month later at the Diet that the principality should renounce the sultan's suzerainty, but his proposal was refused.\n\nGéczi sent letters to András Nagy (who promised to murder Gabriel), but Nagy's letter was captured. Gabriel killed Nagy or had him executed in August, according to various sources. Gabriel Bethlen (the leading figure of the pro-Ottoman policy) fled to Ottoman territory on 12 September, and visited the Ottoman governors of Temesvár, Buda and Kanizsa. With their help, he contacted the grand vizier Nasuh Pasha. Weiss, who wanted to install Géczi as prince in Gyulafehérvár, left Brassó at the head of an undisciplined army on 8 October 1612. Gabriel attacked Weiss and his troops, annihilating them six days later. Weiss was beheaded on the battlefield, and Géczi withdrew to Brassó. The Diet sentenced the absent Géczi and Bethlen to death, granting amnesty to those who had surrendered.\n\nThe Diet authorized Gabriel to begin negotiations with Matthias II, and their envoys signed an alliance in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24 December 1612. Matthias sent his delegates to Transylvania to urge the Saxons to surrender to Gabriel. The treaty outraged Ahmed I, who decided to replace Gabriel with Bethlen in March. Matthias and Gabriel's envoys concluded a new treaty on 12 April, and Matthias acknowledged Gabriel's hereditary right to rule Transylvania. In a secret agreement, Gabriel promised to support Matthias even against the Ottomans. He granted a royal pardon to the Saxons and their allies, including Géczi (who was made commander of Gabriel's guard).\n\nGabriel Bethlen left Istanbul in August, accompanied by Skender, the Pasha of Kanizsa. Radu Mihnea invaded Transylvania from Wallachia in early September. Canibek Giray, Khan of the Crimean Tatars, invaded the principality three weeks later. By early October, Ottoman troops arrived to support Bethlen. Gabriel fled from Transylvania proper and withdrew to Várad to seek assistance from Royal Hungary against Bethlen and his allies. Zsigmond Forgách sent an army of 2,000 troops, commanded by Miklós Abafy, to Várad.\n\nSkender Pasha convoked the delegates of the Three Nations to a Diet at Gyulafehérvár. The Diet dethroned Gabriel on 21 October, urging him in a letter of farewell to accept the decision, and elected Bethlen prince two days later. According to the contemporaneous historian Máté Szepsi Lackó, András Géczi and Miklós Abaffy soon hatched a plot to murder Gabriel in Várad. They entered his room on 26 October 1613 and persuaded him to give them his sword, but did not attack the strong prince because he still had a dagger. The following day, Abaffy told Gabriel that the troops from Royal Hungary wanted to see him. After visiting Abaffy's army, Gabriel returned to Várad in a carriage. Horsemen suddenly attacked the carriage, forcing it to turn into a narrow street. Gabriel jumped out of the carriage, but was soon shot. He tried to resist at a willow tree near the Pece Stream, but dozens of Hajdús attacked and killed him. Hajdú infantry captain Balázs Nagy brought Gabriel's body first to Nagyecsed, and then to Nyírbátor. His body lay unburied in the crypt of the church in Nyírbátor, and he was ceremoniously buried at Bethlen's order only in 1628.\n\nTransylvania went through a chaotic period during Gabriel's rule. Historian Katalin Péter states that Gabriel \"was not the man to tolerate inaction for long\" and \"ruled with extravagance and capricious irresponsibility\". Gabriel, according to Péter, was unable to keep a balance among the different groups of the Transylvanian nobility, which gave rise to new tensions between Calvinists and Catholics, natives and newcomers, pro-Habsburg and pro-Ottoman politicians. Neither could he realize that the Ottoman Empire had recovered after the Long Turkish War by the time he ascended the throne and his expansionist ambitions were not tolerated by the Sultan. Historian László Nagy's evaluation of Báthory's rule is different. He says that Báthory's bad fame can be traced back to the works of historians who worked in the court of Gabriel Bethlen who made conscious efforts to denigrate his predecessor. Nagy also emphasizes that 17th-century popular literary works show that many commoners was mourning Báthory's death. The 20th-century Hungarian novelist Zsigmond Móricz characterizes Gabriel Báthory as a \"true fairy prince\", adding that \"fairies are unfit for this world\".\n\nGabriel's wife, Anna, was the daughter of György Horváth Palocsai and Krisztina Sulyok. According to Nagy Szabó, she was \"a big fat woman\" and Gabriel \"did possibly not love her too much\". Michael Weiss said that Gabriel's separation from his wife was a reason for the Saxons' rebellion because it contradicted divine law. Bethlen accused Gabriel of an incestuous affair with his sister, Anna, first mentioning the rumour in Istanbul in 1613 in an attempt to depose him. The accusation was repeated during a secret lawsuit against Anna, whom Bethlen accused of witchcraft in 1614.\n\n\n"}

This equipment made it possible, for the first time, to record the actual time that an employee worked and not just the beginning and end times of the working day. This was revolutionary in the 1960s.\nTo reach a wide public with his flexible working hours concepts and to make them popular, Haller created the Swabian / English slogan 'I laik Gleitzeit' (I like Flexitime), which became the subject of discussion for many and was seen as bumper stickers on many cars.\n\nHis ideas and concepts caused him to be known as the \"father of Flexitime\" and led to the discussion on making working hours flexible be discussed across the then West Germany, and with time to find more and more implementation. Haller advocated \"three for two\" job sharing to combat unemployment in the late 1970s. His advice was in demand as a Flexitime expert, not only in Germany but also worldwide.\n\nIn the course of this development, Haller started to design the first computer system worldwide from which a little later the first PC-based time recording equipment for SME's (small to medium-sized businesses) were developed. In their basic mode of operation, these systems met the standards of all time recording systems today. Many other products and patents can be attributed to Haller's inventions.\n\nIn order to achieve his goals faster and better and to give the employees a share in the success, Haller founded the company Interflex Datensysteme with three others of like mind which continually developed to become European market leader (it was later taken over by Ingersoll Rand). Haller built his organization on the basis of progressive management concepts. Employee motivation played a central role in this. The idea was that one third of profits should be shared each by investors, employees and charitable projects. A novelty for that time was the active involvement of employees in decision making processes.\n\nHaller never saw himself as the boss but rather as part of a team, yet he was nevertheless a recognized and competent CEO. He was able to make his ideas understood and related them to others, inspiring and exciting his employees, winning them for a shared vision, and thus using their knowledge potential for the organization. It was extremely important for Haller for work to be fun.\n\nWilli Haller left his company in the 1980s and worked as a consultant and coach in companies, trade unions, institutions and social organizations. He founded a number of social projects, including the \"Lebens House“ and the \"Nudel House“. He was guest speaker at universities and management seminars and appeared in television shows.\n\nAlthough Haller was a radical thinker, he also had an influence on leading managers because he was not only charismatic but also pragmatic and logical in his argumentation. He is the author of a number of books and many articles about management, economy and theological themes. He saw himself as the student of the philosopher Martin Buber, whose influence is apparent in Haller's book \"Das Dunkle Feuer\" demonstrated in this translation of an extract:\n\nHaller's ideas continue to be a source of influence even after his death, including in the work of the International Leadership and Business Society, which has set as its aim the humanising of work.\n\n"}

It is the most important commercial compound of antimony. It is found in nature as the minerals valentinite and senarmontite. Like most polymeric oxides, SbO dissolves in aqueous solutions with hydrolysis.\n\nGlobal production of antimony(III) oxide in 2012 was 130,000 tonnes, an increase from 112,600 tonnes in 2002. China produces the largest share followed by US/Mexico, Europe, Japan and South Africa and other countries (2%).\n\nAs of 2010, antimony(III) oxide was produced at four sites in EU27. It is produced via two routes, re-volatilizing of crude antimony(III) oxide and by oxidation of antimony metal.\nOxidation of antimony metal dominates in Europe. Several processes for the production of crude antimony(III) oxide or metallic antimony from virgin material. The choice of process depends on the composition of the ore and other factors. Typical steps include mining, crushing and grinding of ore, sometimes followed by froth flotation and separation of the metal using pyrometallurgical processes (smelting or roasting) or in a few cases (e.g. when the ore is rich in precious metals) by hydrometallurgical processes. These steps do not take place in the EU but closer to the mining location.\n\nStep 1) Crude stibnite is oxidized to crude antimony(III) oxide using furnaces operating at approximately 500 to 1,000 °C. The reaction is the following:\nStep 2) The crude antimony(III) oxide is purified by sublimation.\n\nAntimony metal is oxidized to antimony(III) oxide in furnaces. The reaction is exothermic. Antimony(III) oxide is formed through sublimation and recovered in bag filters. The size of the formed particles is controlled by process conditions in furnace and gas flow. The reaction can be schematically described by:\n\nAntimony(III) oxide is an amphoteric oxide, it dissolves in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to give the meta-antimonite NaSbO, which can be isolated as the trihydrate. Antimony(III) oxide also dissolves in concentrated mineral acids to give the corresponding salts, which hydrolyzes upon dilution with water. With nitric acid, the trioxide is oxidized to antimony(V) oxide.\n\nWhen heated with carbon, the oxide is reduced to antimony metal. With other reducing agents such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride, the unstable and very toxic gas stibine is produced. When heated with potassium bitartrate, a complex salt potassium antimony tartrate, KSb(OH)•CHO is formed.\n\nThe structure of SbO depends on the temperature of the sample. Dimeric SbO is the high temperature (1560 °C) gas. SbO molecules are bicyclic cages, similar to the related oxide of phosphorus(III), phosphorus trioxide. The cage structure is retained in a solid that crystallizes in a cubic habit. The Sb-O distance is 197.7 pm and the O-Sb-O angle of 95.6°. This form exists in nature as the mineral senarmontite. Above 606 °C, the more stable form is orthorhombic, consisting of pairs of -Sb-O-Sb-O- chains that are linked by oxide bridges between the Sb centers. This form exists in nature as the mineral valentinite.\n\nThe annual consumption of antimony(III) oxide in the United States and Europe is approximately 10,000 and 25,000 tonnes, respectively. The main application is as flame retardant synergist in combination with halogenated materials. The combination of the halides and the antimony is key to the flame-retardant action for polymers, helping to form less flammable chars. Such flame retardants are found in electrical apparatuses, textiles, leather, and coatings.\n\nOther applications:\n\nAntimony(III) oxide has suspected carcinogenic potential for humans. Its TLV is 0.5 mg/m, as for most antimony compounds.\nNo other human health hazards were identified for antimony(III) oxide, and no risks to human health and the environment were identified from the production and use of antimony trioxide in daily life.\n\n\n"}

Football tops ice hockey in the number of registered players (115,000 vs. 60,000) and as a popular hobby (160,000 vs. 90,000 in adults and 230,000 vs. 105, 000 in youth). It is the most popular hobby among 3-18 year olds, whereas ice hockey is 9th.\n\nFootball's standing is constantly increasing, especially among girls and women, where the yearly growth rate has lately been over 10 percent. In season 2006–07 19.9 percent of registered players were female. The Football Association of Finland () has approximately one thousand member clubs. According to a Gallup poll, nearly 400,000 people include football in their hobbies.\n\nFootball was first brought to Finland in the 1890s by English sailors, and it was first played in Turku. The first national competition in the sport was set up in 1906, and won by a school team from Turku. The Football Association of Finland was founded in 1907 and it joined FIFA the following year. Due to the sport's historically low status in Finland, the country has never really excelled in football. Only since the 1980s, due to the revival of Finnish football, has the country produced such international stars as Jari Litmanen, Antti Niemi, Sami Hyypiä, Mikael Forssell, Mixu Paatelainen, Teemu Tainio and Jussi Jääskeläinen.\n\nThe highest division in Finnish men's football is the \"Veikkausliiga\", comprising 12 professional football teams. Below that is a league system maintained by the Finnish Football Association, with \"Ykkönen\", or First Division, as the second highest division, with 10 teams. Beneath \"Ykkönen\", each division is divided into 'groups' based on the location of the clubs. For instance, the Second Division, or \"Kakkonen\", has 40 teams divided into four regional groups, each of 10 teams.\n\nThe Finnish Cup is Finland's national cup competition, open to all member clubs of the Finnish Football Association. In the 2009 season, 356 clubs signed up to take part in the competition.\n\nAll Finnish domestic football competitions take place in the spring, summer and autumn, due to weather conditions. Similar systems are used in the other Nordic countries as well, except for Denmark which had that system in the past.\nThe Finland national team played its first international match in 1911 against Sweden. Finland was still then a Grand Duchy part of the Russian Empire, and became independent in 1917. Finland have played in a few Olympic Games, finishing fourth in 1912, but have so far never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Finland qualified to UEFA European Championship for the first time in 2020.\n\nThe Football Association of Finland also organizes national under-19 and under-21 teams.\n\nThe Finland women's national football team made their competitive debut in the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football qualification. To date, their most successful competition has been UEFA Women's Euro 2005, where they reached the semi-finals stage.\n\nSince 1943 the Åland Football Association (ÅFA) has organized football in the Åland Islands. The ÅFA is a district association of the Football Association of Finland. However, the Åland Islands fields independent men's and women's national teams, principally competing in the Island Games.\n\n"}

A supporter of King Charles I, he held offices including Lord President of the Court of Session and was a Privy Counsellor. Although he fell from favour, he continued to support the Royal cause during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when his estates were damaged by the troops of Oliver Cromwell. He married Agnes, daughter of Patrick, Lord Gray, and had a son John Graham, Lord of Kinpont, who had a son William Graham, 8th Earl of Menteith who prior to his death was styled William Graham, Lord of Kinpont.\n\nBorn in 1591 or 1592, William Graham was still in his minority in the early part of 1610 when a royal dispensation was granted, and on 7 August that year, he reached the age of majority and was served heir to his father in the earldom of Menteith, the lands of Kilbride, and others. He devoted much of his early life to consolidating and adding to his estates.\n\nIn 1621, Graham had a Commission of Justiciary over the criminal activity in his lands, and in that same year he first sat in Parliament. Appointed a member of the Privy Council of Scotland in 1626, he was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1628, an office he held in conjunction with that of Lord Justice General. He was held in great favour by Charles I, who appointed him a member of the English Privy Council.\n\nHaving attained a position of influence, William Graham initiated a suit to try and reclaim the earldom of Strathearn, comprising the lands of Strathearn which encompassed all of Menteith and other areas. This earldom had been lost by his ancestor Malise Graham, 1st Earl of Menteith, in 1427. He proceeded on the idea that the earldom of Strathearn only followed along male lines of descent, and therefore reverted to him, and he was not hindered in his efforts. He was created Earl of Strathearn in 1631, and took action to secure his authority over all of Strathearn.\n\nGraham met with some opposition which dealt with his claims to the Earldom of Menteith and his bloodline. William Graham's opponents, who possessed some of the lands of Strathearn, showed great alarm at the fact that William Graham was to be the earl of their lands, and took it upon themselves to tell of William Graham's boasting of a bloodline more royal than the King, Charles I. It is said that in front of witnesses he boasted that he had the reddest blood in Scotland and that the King was obliged to him for his crown, a charge which Earl William denied. The argument involving the royal bloodline involves an inheritance or relation to David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn, the son of King Robert II of Scotland, which was necessary to his legal claim for the Earldom of Strathearn.\n\nBecause the lineage of Robert II was of then a matter of some controversy, the patent was withdrawn in 1633 and he was created Earl of Airth instead. He subsequently lost the favor of Charles I. Airth is a small location which is well south-west of Aberfoyle, and therefore it was a title of some negativity. He was ordered to confine himself to Airth for four years, until he was restored to favour in 1637 and served against the Covenanters. In 1639, 1644, and 1645, and remaining staunch to the royal cause not withstanding the penalty imposed on him by Charles I, he served in the Parliaments, and in 1639 he was reappointed as a Privy Councillor, likely because of his refusal to take the covenants.\n\nDuring this time, Airth Castle was made a garrison by Cromwell's invading troops, and the Earl was ordered to cut down the woods in Aberfoyle parish. The crops were wasted and burned by the Cromwell's general, George Monck. The losses sustained by the Earl of Airth were never recouped, and overwhelmed, he was forced to part with nearly all of his lands to gain enough money to recover his estate.\n\nThe Earl of Airth died, likely after the month of April, in 1661. He had seven sons (John, James, Andrew, Robert, Patrick, Charles, Archibald) and four daughters (Mary, Margaret, Anne, and Jean).\n\nHis son John Graham married Lady Mary Keith, and died leaving a son, William Graham, who succeeded to his grandfather's titles.\n\n"}
{"id": "2067895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067895", "title": "Visions of Johanna", "text": "Visions of Johanna\n\n\"Visions of Johanna\" is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan on his 1966 album \"Blonde on Blonde\". Several critics have acclaimed \"Visions of Johanna\" as one of Dylan's highest achievements in writing, praising the allusiveness and subtlety of the language. \"Rolling Stone\" included \"Visions of Johanna\" on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1999, Sir Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, listed it as the greatest song lyric ever written.\n\nDylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965, under the working title of \"Freeze Out\", but was dissatisfied with the results. When the \"Blonde on Blonde\" recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966, Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians, and decided to release this performance. All of the alternate versions of the song have been officially released, but some only on a limited edition collectors set: many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio outtakes, and two others are live performances from his 1966 world tour.\n\nNumerous artists have recorded cover versions of the song, including the Grateful Dead, Marianne Faithfull and Robyn Hitchcock.\n\nClinton Heylin places the writing of \"Visions of Johanna\" in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his pregnant wife Sara. Heylin notes that \"in this déclassé hotel…the heat pipes \"still\" cough\", referring to a line from the song. Greil Marcus reports that when the song was first released, \"the story was that the song had been written during the great east coast blackout of November 9, 1965.\"\nDylan first recorded this song, backed by The Hawks, in the CBS New York recording studio, on November 30, 1965, announcing his new composition with the words: \"This is called 'Freeze Out'.\" Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the \"air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched...full of whispering and muttering.\" According to Marcus, Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words, \"Seems like a freeze-out.\"\n\nSome of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line \"He examines the nightingale's code\". Historian Sean Wilentz, for his book \"Dylan In America\", listened closely to full studio tapes of the \"Blonde on Blonde\" sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted \"Visions of Johanna\" played. At one point, Dylan says: \"It's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie.\" Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan \"quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on \"Blonde on Blonde\"—and it is still not right.\" Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on \"\" in 2005.\n\n\"Visions of Johanna\" fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer, Bob Johnston, to move the recording sessions to Nashville, Tennessee. During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio, on February 14, 1966, the \"Blonde on Blonde\" version of the song was recorded. In an interview with Andy Gill, Al Kooper has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan's vocal. Kooper added that \"it's very important what Joe South's bass is doing in that\"; Kooper described it as \"this throbbing...rhythmically amazing bass part\". Other backing musicians were Charlie McCoy, guitar, Wayne Moss, guitar, and Kenneth Buttrey on drums.\n\nDylan first performed \"Visions of Johanna\" in public on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, \"He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him I was there that night and he performed it.\" Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg to be an important influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.\n\nAll live versions of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. Dylan's performance of the song at London's Royal Albert Hall on May 26, 1966, appeared on \"Biograph\", released in 1985. Asked by Cameron Crowe, for the liner notes for \"Biograph\", how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, \"I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual.\" A performance of the song recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on May 17, 1966, was released on \"\" in 1998. In addition, a May 6, 1966, performance of the song, recorded in Belfast, was included on \"Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections\", released in 2018.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, Legacy Recordings released a 36-CD boxed set, \"The 1966 Live Recordings\", which comprises every known recording of Bob Dylan’s 1966 concert tour. The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains, New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the Royal Albert Hall concert in London on May 27. The set contains 18 live performances of \"Visions of Johanna\", all featuring Dylan solo on acoustic guitar. (The May 26, 1966, performance was included on the separately released album \"The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert\".)\n\nThe \"Visions of Johanna\" studio recording sessions were released in their entirety on the 18-disc Collector's Edition of \"\" on November 6, 2015, with highlights from the November 30, 1965, outtakes appearing on the 6-disc and 2-disc versions of that album. The 18-disc version contains 14 takes of \"Visions of Johanna\" recorded in New York on November 30, 1965, and 4 takes of the song recorded in Nashville on February 14, 1966, the last being the \"Blonde on Blonde\" version of the song.\n\nNoting how popular \"Visions of Johanna\" remains among \"hardcore Dylanophiles,\" Andy Gill suggests it is the enigmatic quality of the song that is responsible for its popularity—\"forever teetering on the brink of lucidity, yet remaining impervious to strict decipherment\". Gill writes that the song begins by contrasting two lovers, the carnal Louise, and \"the more spiritual but unattainable\" Johanna. Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.\n\nClinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song. Written around the time of Dylan's marriage to Sara Lownds, Heylin describes it as \"one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city\". Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover, Heylin speculates that \"it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse,\" who, in the song, is \"not here\". For Heylin, the triumph of the song lies in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way\".\n\nDylan critic Michael Gray also praises the subtlety of the song. Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is \"about\", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up \"abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology\".\n\nRobert Shelton called \"Visions of Johanna\" one of Dylan's major works. He writes that Dylan's technique of throwing out \"skittering images\" evokes \"a mind floating downstream\"; these \"non-sequential visions\" are the record of a fractured consciousness. Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal, the visions of Johanna, and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless. He suggests that the same paradox is explored by Keats in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\".\n\nMike Marqusee situates the song in New York City, \"a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape\". Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is \"too concise and too clear\". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet hungry for an authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. \"It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point.\"\n\nGuitarist and critic Bill Janovitz also emphasizes the urban, unreal quality of \"Visions of Johanna\", calling it a \"sprawling epic\". \"The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, as well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'.\" For Janovitz, this could \"possibly be a swipe at a critic\".\n\nLiterary critic Christopher Ricks, in his study of Dylan's work, pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines:\n\nRicks writes that the phrase \"and all\" turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of \"aggression and baffled anger\".\n\nTrying to unravel the mystery of the song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions, rather than external ones: \"Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent—isn't it obvious that whoever wrote \"Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?\" already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?\" Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of \"People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step.\" For Marcus, \"'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere.\"\n\nThe song has been described by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine placed the song at No. 404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan \"never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966.\" (When \"Rolling Stone\" updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No. 413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised \"the concentration and surprise\" of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the \"rasp of his anger\" was a part of his greatness. In 2017, the International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded, stating, \"The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead.\" In an interview with \"The Independent\" in 1992, cult British musician Robyn Hitchcock described the song by saying \"it's pretty much the reason I'm a singer\". Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, \"I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way.\"\n\nThe Grateful Dead played \"Visions of Johanna\" in concert a number of times between 1986 and 1995, and both they and Jerry Garcia solo each released a live version on record. There is also a 16-minute studio version of the song on Jerry Garcia's \"All Good Things Redux\", a bonus CD provided with the \"\" box set of Garcia's studio recordings.\n\nOther artists who have covered the song include Marianne Faithfull, Robyn Hitchcock, Lee Ranaldo, Chris Smither, former Flamin' Groovies guitarist Chris Wilson, Julie Felix, Maggie Holland, and Old Crow Medicine Show. The jazz trio Jewels and Binoculars, who named themselves after a phrase from \"Visions of Johanna\", recorded an instrumental treatment of the song on their album \"The Music of Bob Dylan\". Foreign language versions of the song include a recording by Jan Erik Vold, Kåre Virud and Telemark Blueslag in Norwegian, Gerard Quintana's and Jordi Batiste's version in Catalan, Steffen Brandt's in Danish, and Ernst Jansz's in Dutch.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2067902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067902", "title": "Drug Recognition Expert", "text": "Drug Recognition Expert\n\nA Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) is a law enforcement officer trained to identify people whose driving is impaired by drugs other than, or in addition to, alcohol .\nAll DREs follow the same 12 step procedure called a Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE), to determine which category of drugs is causing the driver to be impaired.\n\nIf a DRE determines that a driver was too impaired to operate a vehicle in a safe manner, they will look for indications of the drug(s) suspected, by the common perceivable effects the drugs have on the human body. There are seven categories of classifications a DRE is looking for, including; central nervous system depressants (benzodiazepines), CNS stimulants (methamphetamine), dissociative anesthetics (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens (mushrooms), inhalants (glue), and narcotic analgesics (opiates).\n\nDREs often testify in court, where the term \"expert\" has important legal implications. The Traffic Resource for Judges describes different approaches taken by state courts in how DRE evidence is admitted. \"Different jurisdictions take a variety of approaches to DRE testimony. Some jurisdictions hold DRE protocol and evidence to be scientific evidence; some do not. Some jurisdictions permit DRE testimony to be introduced as expert testimony (usually under Rule of Evidence 702 or the equivalent in that state), while some jurisdiction require DRE testimony to be introduced as non-expert opinion testimony. Some jurisdictions analyze DRE testimony through the lens of Daubert, while other jurisdictions use the Frye analysis.\" \n\nThe acronym 'DRE' has been used to refer not just to the DRE officers, but also to the examination they perform, the \"Drug Recognition Examination\", or \"Drug Recognition Evaluation.\" The confluence of acronyms leads to confusion, and the IACP now calls the evaluation done by DRE officers the \"Drug Influence Evaluation\", DIE.\n\nDIEs were developed by police officers from the Los Angeles Police Department in the early 1970s. The officers' drug recognition methods were officially recognized by the LAPD management in 1979, and adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the early 1980s.\n\nAs of 2005, approximately 6,000 police officers are certified as Drug Recognition Experts. Certification is issued by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). To remain certified and in good standing, DREs must track their evaluations and enter the results into an online database.\n\nDRE training and certification standards are defined by the International Association of Chiefs of Police Training is available only to \"a person ... in the employ and under the direct control of a public criminal justice agency involved in the enforcement of criminal or traffic safety laws or an institution involved in providing training services to officers of law enforcement agencies.\". IACP standards require DREs training to be done using an official Student Manual. This manual. is widely cited in court as defining standards for the performance of a Drug Influence Evaluation.\n\nA DIE involves the following 12 steps (a detailed description for each step is given at the DECP.org)\n\nThe DIE testing done by DRE officers is said to be scientific. This claim is critical to the admission of DRE expert testimony in criminal trials. The DRE Student Manual identifies three scientific studies as being those that validate DRE testing. These studies are: Bigelow 1985 (aka the Johns Hopkins study); Compton 1986 (aka the LAPD-173 study); and Adler 1994 (aka the Arizona DRE Validation Study).\n\nIn 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada held that \"a DRE is a “drug recognition expert”, certified as such for the purposes of the 12 step evaluation. By reason of his training and experience, a DRE undoubtedly possesses expertise on determining drug impairment that is outside the experience and knowledge of the trier of fact. He is thus an expert for the purpose of applying the 12 step evaluation and determining whether that evaluation indicates drug impairment. His expertise has been conclusively and irrebuttably established by Parliament. Knowledge of the underlying science is not a precondition to the admissibility of a DRE’s opinion.\" \n\nThis mirrors US case law where testimony of police officers regarding alcohol impairment is admitted in court without the need for the officer to be an expert in, or to testify to, the underlying sciences of the sobriety tests they are trained to administer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2067904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067904", "title": "Ontario Highway 26", "text": "Ontario Highway 26\n\nKing's Highway 26, commonly referred to as Highway 26, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, connecting the cities of Barrie and Owen Sound. Between these two cities, the highway serves the southern shoreline of Georgian Bay, passing through Stayner, Collingwood and Meaford and by the Blue Mountain Resort. In addition, the highway serves as the main route to Wasaga Beach, a popular recreational destination during the summer months.\n\nHighway 26 between Owen Sound and Meaford in the west is not as highly traveled as the tourist areas to the east. It is also not a very straight route, as the highway makes four right-hand turns at signalled intersections, including the junction with Simcoe Road 27 (formerly Highway 27) north of Barrie (which is not signalled), the intersection with Simcoe Roads 91 and 42 in Stayner, Hume Street in eastern Collingwood, and High Street in western Collingwood. \n\nFrom Meaford eastwards, the highway runs along the Georgian Bay shoreline, and in The Blue Mountains (extending from Thornbury eastwards through to the west limits of Collingwood), passes through a nearly continuous corridor of low-density resort-style residential developments, mostly concentrated in the Blue Mountain Resort area. Between Collingwood and Wasaga Beach, the highway is a four-lane divided roadway with roundabouts transitioning to the undivided sections at both ends: one at Mosely Street in Wasaga Beach, and the other at Poplar Sideroad in Collingwood.\n\nThe routing of the highway takes it from the junction with Highway 6, Highway 10 and Highway 21 in Owen Sound to its terminus at Highway 400 in Barrie at the Bayfield street interchange. For a time, the highway continued southward to Dunlop street, formerly Highway 11, in Barrie, cosigned with Highway 27. The southern portion of Bayfield street was downloaded to the City of Barrie along with Dunlop street in 1997, when these sections of Highway 27 and 11 were eliminated. This shortened the highway's length by 1.3 kilometers and removed the 7.2 kilometer concurrency with Highway 27. The highway's current length is 115.7 km.\n\nThe highway serves as a major link between Barrie and the Greater Toronto Area (via Highway 400) and the popular tourist region on the southern shore of Georgian Bay. Over the past several years the popularity of this region has increased, and traffic levels have increased accordingly. Major reconstruction work was undertaken to repair the very old bridge over the Nottawasaga River in Edenvale (between Barrie and Stayner).\n\nHighway 26 was first assumed by the Department of Highways on July 2, 1927 along an existing trunk route between Barrie and Owen Sound. At its western terminus, the route ended at Highway 6; the eastern terminus was at Highway 11. Since then, the route has remained almost unchanged, except in the Collingwood and Barrie areas.\nPrior to the completion of the Pretty River Parkway in Collingwood in the 1970s, Highway 26 was routed through Collingwood along Hume Street, before making a 90 degree right turn (north) at the intersection with Highway 24 (Now Simcoe Road 124, Hurontario Street) with which it was concurrent until Highway 24's terminus at First Street, where Highway 26 makes a 90 degree left turn (west) onto First Street, continuing on the present route. The Pretty River Parkway was a bypass of this highly congested downtown route, branching off to the north from Hume Street and swinging gradually westward along the shoreline until becoming Huron Street, which is the eastward extension of First Street beyond Hurontario. In 2003, Pretty River Parkway was widened to four lanes to match the existing sections of Huron and First Streets. \nIn 2012, a bypass east of Collingwoood was constructed and it opened on November 15 of that year. It was constructed due to the old route being a dangerous section of road with numerous intersecting side streets and private residences with direct highway entrances, along with very high traffic volumes. The new alignment has the highway veer west in the west end of Wasaga Beach, and parallel the current highway until a point near the eastern town limits of Collingwood. The former route now named as Beachwood Road from Collingwood to Mosely Street in Wasaga Beach. The remaining section of the former alignment south of Mosely Street has been renamed Lyons Court.\nWithin Barrie, a portion of Highway 26 was transferred to the city in 1998, truncating it at Highway 400. This former portion is now known simply as Bayfield Street.\nIt is believed that the bypass is the first part in realigning the existing highway within the Collingwood area that would potentially see the bypass extended around the town, but no other projects or studies are underway that would expand this highway beyond its current length. \n\n"}

Savané ran as the party's presidential candidate in the 1993 election, taking 2.91% of the vote. AJ/PADS was the only major opposition group to consistently refuse to participate in the government under President Abdou Diouf and the Socialist Party (PS). At its February 1998 congress, it considered but decided against joining the Socialist International. In March 1999, AJ/PADS and two other left-wing parties, the Party of Independence and Labor (PIT) and the Democratic League/Movement for the Labour Party (LD/MPT), agreed to support the candidacy of opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) in the 2000 presidential election.

Party spokesman Madièye Mbodj said that boycotting was \"not an efficient means to meet a political demand\". The coalition won three seats, including one for Savané. In the August 2007 election to the Senate, AJ/PADS won one seat, from Vélingara Department, out of 35 elected seats; Wade's PDS won all of the other seats.\n\nAfter 2007, split developed in the party between the \"reformist\" and \"communist\" factions, with the latter group, which includes Madièye Mbodj, criticizing Savané and party leadership for their cooperation with Wade and alleged abandonment of communist ideas for the sake of self-interest. Savané and the reformist faction split into And Jëf / African Party for Democracy and Socialism / Authentic (AJ/PADS/A) and joined the Patriotic Front for the Defence of the Republic in 2014, a coalition of parties affiliated with the Senegalese Democratic Party.\n\n"}

For years it was led by Amath Dansokho.\nPIT emerged from the Senegalese branch of the African Independence Party (PAI). At the time of the 1960 local elections, PAI was accused by the government of fomenting unrest following a series of incidents in Saint-Louis. PAI was banned and went underground. The general secretary, Majhmoud Diop, and Tidiane Baïdy Ly went into exile in Guinea.\n\nIn 1963 at the 23rd plenary session of the Central Committee of PAI a group of party cadres, including Babacar Niang and Tidiane Baïdy Ly, were expelled from the party, accused of \"anti-party fractional activity, right-wing opportunist tendencies\" (Momsarew, April 1964).\n\nIn the December 1, 1963 elections PAI joined the Senegalese Democracy and Unity bloc.\n\nWhereas many young cadres of the clandestine PAI went to study at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, one section were sent to Cuba to receive training in guerrilla warfare. A group of 25 PAI guerillas entered eastern Senegal in 1965 trying to launch armed struggle against the government. The guerillas were, however, soon overrun captured and imprisoned.\n\nIn 1965 PAI split, when Landing Savané left to form the pro-Chinese Senegalese Communist Party. This split led to the dismantling of the Dakar cell of PAI.\n\nIn 1966 Seydou Cissokho took over as general secretary. In 1967 a rectification campaign was initiated, strengthening the position of Cissokho.\n\nDuring the period 1965-1968 PAI had a low profile. It worked in the \"Syndicat des Enseignants du Sénégal\" and the Association of Senegalese Workers in France (ATSF).\n\nAt the 1972 congress Majhmoud Diop, the former general secretary, was expelled. The party was now completely in the hands of Cissokho.\n\n1972-1975 was in many ways a period of reconstruction of PAI. Its main publication, \"Momsarev\", started appearing somewhat regularly. PAI went on to organize a students' movement, Students Movement of the African Independence Party (MEPAI). This would later evolve into the General Union of Senegalese Students, Pupils and Probationary Teachers in Europe in 1975. This student movement would however rapidly split away from the party, and form the more radical Democratic League.\n\nIn 1976 Majhmoud Diop and his followers regrouped. Effectively two separate parties worked with the name PAI, PAI-Sénégal (led by Cissokho, technically the original PAI) and PAI-Rénovation (led by Diop).\n\nSoon PAI-Rénovation was accorded recognition by the state to the name PAI. In 1977 PAI-Sénégal appealed to the president to substitute PAI-Rénovation for itself as the legal left.\n\nPAI-Sénégal called for a boycott of the 1978 elections.\n\nIn 1979 PIT formed a new youth wing, Democratic Youth Union Alboury Ndiaye (\"Union de la Jeunesse Démocratique Alboury Ndiaye\").\n\nPAI-Sénégal later registered itself with the authorities as PIT on July 9, 1981.\n\nIn March 1999, the PIT and two other left-wing parties, And-Jëf/African Party for Democracy and Socialism (AJ/PADS) and the Democratic League/Movement for the Labour Party (LD/MPT), agreed to support the candidacy of opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) in the 2000 presidential election. After Wade's victory, the PIT joined the new government. Differences between Wade and PIT soon surged, and eight months after the installment of the new government the PIT was expelled.

{"id": "2067927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067927", "title": "Alan Heusaff", "text": "Alan Heusaff\n\nAlan Heusaff, also Alan Heussaff (23 July 1921 in Saint-Yvi, Finistère – 3 November 1999 in Galway) was a Breton nationalist, linguist, dictionary compiler, prolific journalist and lifetime campaigner for solidarity between the Celtic peoples. A co-founder of the Celtic League in 1961, he was its first general secretary until 1984.\n\nA native Breton speaker, he trained as a primary school teacher but in his early twenties joined the separatist Bezen Perrot militia (1943–44), for which he was sentenced to death \"in absentia\" at a court martial by the post-World War II French government, but eventually amnestied in 1967. After studying mathematics and physics at the University of Marburg, Germany, he arrived in Ireland in 1950. He continued his studies at University College, Galway, and, on graduation, joined the Irish Meteorological Service, becoming a naturalised Irish citizen in 1955.\n\nAn aviation meteorologist, he devoted his spare time and retirement to peaceful activism, promoting the languages, culture and autonomy of the Celtic countries. Among the honours he received for his work was the 1986 \"Gradam an Phiarsaigh\" (annual Pearse award) presented by the President of Ireland, Patrick Hillery. In the same year, at the Welsh Eisteddfod, he was elected as a Bard of the Welsh Gorsedd. He was fluent in all the six modern Celtic languages as well as English, French and German.\n\nHeusaff died on 3 November 1999, at his home near An Spidéal in Connemara, Galway. He married Bríd Ní Dhochartaigh in 1953 (died 2 February 2008); the couple had six children, four girls and two boys.\n\nHeusaff was born in 1921 in Sant Ivi, near Rosporden, now in Kernev (Cornouaille, Department of Finistère). His family originated in nearby Toulgoat and his parents, Sébastien and Mari Heusaff, were native Breton speakers. Heusaff spoke only Breton at the time he was sent to school.(1) When Heusaff was growing up it was estimated there were well over a million native speakers of this Celtic language. In 1925 the French Minister of Education, Anatole de Monzie, made clear the Government policy: \"\"For the linguistic unity of France, Breton must be exterminated\"\". Now banned by law was the teaching of language, literature, history, folklore and anything interpreted as \"nationalist\". (2)\n\nArriving in a French-speaking school in these circumstances profoundly affected the boy. His community's language was openly vilified and children were punished if caught speaking it. Nevertheless, Heusaff had a good ear for languages and eventually joined the École Normale in Kemper (Quimper, Finistère) where he trained as a primary-school teacher. He continued to be acutely aware of the state's policy on Breton. Most native speakers, under these conditions, were made illiterate in their own language by the state. Yet Breton was an old literary language with the first manuscripts in it surviving from a century earlier than such manuscripts in French.(3)\n\nTo teach himself literacy in Breton, Heusaff sent for a correspondence course from Skol-Ober founded in 1932 by Marc'harid Gourlaouen (1902–1987). As it was not politic to do so openly, he found help from a native speaker who offered the use of his address as a post-restante to receive the lessons. In an interview in 2005 with the historian Daniel Leach, his widow, Bríd Heusaff commented on the effect of his school experience on his life: \"I'm fairly certain that if Breton had been taught at school when Alan went there… and if there had been some respect for it, that he would never have become involved in the Breton movement at all. Because his main interest, really, was the language\". (4)\n\nIn 1938, as a teenager, Heusaff joined the Parti National Breton (PNB) which sought to re-assert Breton independence. The crowns of Brittany and France had become unified by the marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France, as a condition following the defeat of the Breton armies at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier in 1488. Following the death of Charles VIII in 1498, Anne was forced to marry his cousin, Louis XII of France, to ensure the French crown's continued control of Brittany. Under the \"Traité d'Union de la Bretagne à la France\", 18 September 1532, the Breton Parliament remained in being until the French National Assembly, following the French Revolution, arbitrarily abolished it in 1790. This caused a complicated situation in Brittany as many Bretons had spearheaded the Revolution as a means of overthrowing the centralist politics of the French monarchy.(5)\n\nHeusaff stated in 1970: \"From 1938 onwards I shared the conviction that Brittany could never regain her freedom \"by consent\"; the French state would use all its strength to prevent that ever happening. I agreed that we should seek external support, wherever it came from, because we were too weak to attain our aims alone. Why should we not do what all free countries do when their freedom is threatened; seek alliances? By doing so we were affirming that we were already free\".(6)\n\nHeusaff joined the PNB's uniformed but unarmed Bagadoù Stourm and then gravitated to the Kadervenn group of PNB, which believed in direct action. He became convinced that only separation from France would save both the language and the cultural identity, which he believed was dependent on its survival. Like many other Breton nationalists, he was greatly influenced by the Irish example of the 1916 Easter Rising. From the experience of their fellow Celts of Ireland during World War I, many young Bretons came to believe that if war were to break out again, then France's difficulty would be Brittany's opportunity. \n\nIn 1940, German forces overwhelmed France and Marshal of France Philippe Pétain signed an Armistice. The establishment in July of Marshal Pétain's French collaborationist government in Vichy, however, still gave it legal authority not only in the \"unoccupied south\" but also in northern and western France occupied by the German Wehrmacht. Many Breton militants soon realised that Germany was of little support. Rather than help the Bretons achieve their freedom, the German Occupation allowed the French collaborationist government of Vichy to remove a large section of Brittany, the department of Loire-Atlantique, in 1941. This area included Naoned (Nantes) the capital and seat of the Dukes of Brittany. The transformation of ancient Breton borders was something post-war governments were happy to inherit. With German approval, Vichy suppressed the Breton National Committee (Comité national Breton, CNB, which had been declared by nationalists in 1940) and its journal L'Heure Bretonne.\n\nFrom 1941, as resistance to the occupiers grew, Breton nationalism became more divided. Moderates adopted a neutralist position, imitating that of neutral Ireland. But others, including militant activist Célestin Lainé (later known as Neven Henaff), continued to make overtures to the Nazis, hoping for their support for an independent Brittany with ties to Germany. The more supportive nationalists were of Germany, they reasoned, the more likely Berlin would be to abandon Vichy and create a Breton state.(7) The war divide within Brittany as a whole deepened at the same time and members of the Maquis, the French Resistance, began to view all Breton nationalists as potential collaborators. They allegedly began a policy of assassination of leading Bretons in September 1943. Yann Bricler, a PNB official in Kemper and manager of the PNB magazine Stur, was shot dead in his office. Another nationalist, Yves Kerhoas, was also assassinated. On 12 December 1943, Abbé Yann Vari Perrot, the 66-year-old parish priest of Scrignac, was shot dead on the steps of his church. Perrot had been decorated for his services in World War I, but was a native speaker and leading cultural Breton nationalist, playwright and writer, involved in devising a standard orthography for the language.\n\nCélestin Lainé had led an underground physical force movement, Gwenn-ha-Du (white and black, named after the Breton national flag) from 1930, had organised militant groups such as Lu Brezon, renamed Bezen Kadoudal, and now saw the opportunity to organise an open, uniformed and armed group – Bezen Perrot. The conditions of this unit was that it would not fight outside the borders of Brittany but remain as \"a protective militia\" against the French Maquis's attempts to eliminate Breton activists. But as the conflict on the ground intensified and German reprisals became more ferocious, the authorities took the Bezen Perrot and other groups in hand. By 1944, they had provided the unit with uniforms and weapons, and listed them as a unit of the SD, Sicherheitsdienst. Lainé made clear that Bezen Perrot's war was against France and was on behalf of Brittany not Germany. But although he was reported as concerned that the unit should not operate on behalf of the SD it was used by them and mounted guard on the SD interrogation centre in Rennes. In the months before and after the D-Day landings in June 1944, atrocities were reported on all sides of the conflict in Brittany.\n\nHeusaff had been working as a primary school teach at Kerien (Querrien) and between 1941 and 1942 he began to write articles about the problems of Brittany under the pseudonym \"Mab Ivi\" (Son of Ivi, his home village). Others articles appeared in \"L'Heure Bretonne\" and \"Arvor\". In 1942, he resigned his teaching post. Heusaff had become a \"kerrenour\" (lieutenant) in Bezen Kadoudal, which, in December 1943, became Bezen Perrot and which Heusaff saw as the nucleus of a Breton independence army.(8)\n\n\"We were prepared to co-operate with the devil himself, if that would get rid of the French. The French were the greatest enemies of the Breton people\".(9)\n\nA fuller account of the Bezen Perrot, including Heusaff's role, is given in Daniel Leach's \"Fugitive Ireland\" (Four Courts Press, 2009). Among controversies, Leach deals with some later accusations depicting Heusaff as a member of the LVF, showing them to be unfounded. The main focus of the book is an analysis of why Ireland gave asylum after the war to some Bretons and other foreign militants who had collaborated with Axis forces. Controversies on these issues are also elucidated in Leach's article \"\"Irish Post-War Asylum: Nazi sympathy, Pan Celticism or raisons d'etat?\"\" (\"History Ireland\", May/June 2007). (10)\n\nIn June 1944, shortly after D-Day, Heusaff was at Ploërdut, Morbihan, with members of the Bezen Perrot, when they became involved in a firefight with members of a Free French commando unit. He was seriously wounded in the shoulder and lung. Two others members of his unit were killed. Locals took Heusaff to hospital where he remained for a few weeks before evacuated to a German hospital in Montabaur, Alsace-Lorraine, where he remained until September 1944.\n\nWhile in hospital, he was visited by Friedrich Hielscher, the poet, philosopher and journalist. He had connections with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für keltische studien (German Society for Celtic Studies) in Berlin and had been on a research trip to Brittany in 1943. It is suspected that he took this trip on behalf of the Abwehr, or the Ahnenerbe, which came under the SS. According to some reports, Hielscher had been involved in a resistance circle to the Nazis since the 1930s, helping Jews and others in danger from the regime. Indeed, Hielsher had contacts with members of oppressed \"peuples de culture\" since 1927 and some members of his group were arrested as early as 1933. (11)\n\nOn leaving hospital in late 1944, Heusaff found Breton contacts in Strasbourg and spent time there. Other Bezen Perrot members were living there under assumed identities. Heusaff joined them and adopted the name Bernhard Heubacher, receiving papers with Hielscher's help. Until 1947, he worked in forestry, It was a frugal existence, sometimes he was forced to live on nettle soup. With Hielscher's help, he entered the university to study Physics and Maths. He remained there until 1950. Then he decided to follow other Breton militants who had sought asylum in Ireland. The Allies had swept through Brittany in August 1944, and as the Germans retreated, many of the Bezen Perrot had fled to Germany as well. On 19 September 1944, the Germans on the Crozon Peninsula had surrendered but pockets in L'Orient and in Saint-Nazaire did not surrender until May 1945. \n\nThe former Mayor of Brest, Dr Le Gorgeu, an opponent of Breton nationalism, had taken over civil administration and started a round-up of Breton nationalists. By November 1944, 2,000 Bretons were arrested including priests, women, children and even Bretons who had fought in the Resistance. Some had purportedly done little more than attend a Breton language class; others died of ill treatment in prison. Prisoners from the Rennes Central Gaol reportedly often appeared before the examining magistrate with broken limbs and bruises. By the end of 1946, 3,000 Bretons had been put in special camps; 300 of them had been sentenced to penal servitude for varying terms and 60 sentenced to death. Others had been sentenced to terms of \"civil degradation\", a loss of all civil rights as citizens and removal of qualifications. Of those involved in the Breton movement, 38 had been killed and 9 executed by firing squad, according to contemporary sources such as the Welsh newspaper \"Baner Ac Amserau Cymru\".\n\nHeusaff could not return to Brittany. Like others who went to Ireland for asylum, he was sentenced to death \"in absentia\", not for war crimes, but for the crime of \"attacks upon the integrity of the French State\".(14) He was to receive an amnesty in 1967, along with other Breton militants. Heusaff took his wife to Brittany for the first time in 1967 but were forbidden to visit Finistère, his home department. This restriction was lifted in the early 1970s. From then on until his death, Heusaff returned to Brittany on many occasions. His family had in no way supported his wartime activities and, indeed, his brother had served in the French Army and become a prisoner of war.(15)\n\nOn 20 May 1950, Heusaff left Marburg under the alias \"Bernard Heubacher\", and travelled through Belgium to England and Wales, and then to Ireland, where he enrolled in University College, Galway, to finish his degree. To finance himself, he taught German classes. One of his students was Bríd Ní Dhochartaigh from the Fanaid Gaeltacht in County Donegal. In 1953, the couple married and had six children. He had learned to speak Irish fluently. The couple's two sons and four daughters were raised as an Irish speaking family.(16)\n\nHeusaff joined the Irish Meteorological Service in 1952, still as Bernard Heubacher, and worked at Dublin Airport for eighteen months before being transferred to Shannon Airport. He became a naturalised citizen under his own name in 1955. In 1958, the Heusaff family moved back to Dublin. He worked at Dublin Airport for the rest of his career. Interested in ecological matters, he also spent time researching the history of weather patterns as recorded in Irish annals and documents from earliest times. After his death, Brendan McWilliams, director of the service, and a well-known \"Irish Times\" columnist, wrote:Alan spent his entire working life in aviation meteorology... In addition to his operational duties, he made brave efforts over a period of 15 years to bring the ancient climate of our island into focus, delving into historical documents to identify and record whatever mention might be made of the weather. He found many such references, and unearthed nearly 1,000 useful records extending over 1,400 years from AD 490 to 1829 which, collectively, have added significantly to knowledge of the Irish climate in the centuries gone by. McWilliams adds: \"He was a meticulous and conscientious meteorologist, and I personally remember him as always cheerful, courteous and eager to help to solve whatever operational problems might arise.\" (17)\n\nThe formation of The Celtic league is regarded as Heusaff's major achievement. The modern philosophy of Pan-Celticism, of co-operation between the six modern Celtic nations (the Irish, Manx, Scots, Welsh, Cornish and Bretons) had first been given published form by Charles de Gaulle (1837–1880), a Breton language poet. The League was born in a meeting at the Eisteddfod at Rhos, near Llangollen, in North Wales in 1961.(18) The principal aims were then: (1) to foster co-operation between the national movements in the Celtic countries, particularly in efforts to obtain international recognition and to share the experiences of their struggles and exchange constructive ideas. (2)\n\nHeusaff was elected general secretary, a position he held until 1984–85. An existing magazine \"Celtic Voice\" was offered as a means of propagating the League. By the second annual meeting on 30 September 1962, the League had branches in all six Celtic countries, as well as in London. The League then launched its own quarterly journal \"Celtic News\", initially edited by Welsh historian Dr. Ceinwen Thomas of University College, Cardiff. From 1963 until 1971, an annual volume was also published constituting up to 180 pages. \"Celtic News\" continued under various editors until a more professionally produced journal, \"Carn\", was launched in the Spring of 1973, with Frank Thomson, a Scottish writer and journalist, as its first editor. Still published quarterly, \"Carn\" carries articles in all six Celtic languages, as well as in English and French. \n\nGwynfor Evans MP continued as President until 1972, while Vice-Presidents consisted of leaders of the main political national parties, such as Dr Yann Fouéré of the Mouvement Pour l'Organisation de la Bretagne; Dr Robert McIntyre of the Scottish National Party (and its first Member of Parliament) and Robert Dunstone, the president of the Cornish movement, Mebyon Kernow. However, by 1972, it was decided that conflicts of interest were arising and that the League should elect its own independent president and officials. Such a conflict had arisen in 1969 at the League's annual meeting it Dublin when Gwynfor Evans used his League office to speak of Plaid Cymru policies which conflicted with attitudes in other Celtic countries. Pádraig Ó Conchúir became the first \"chairman\" replacing Gwynfor Evans. Later the officer of \"chairman\" was replaced by \"convenor\". \n\nUnder Heusaff, the League gave evidence to the European Commission of Human Rights in 1963 concerning the persecution of the Breton language. This aroused media attention. The League sent an official delegation to the 14th Congress of the Federal Union of European Nationalities (representing ethnic minorities), and in November 1965, the League delivered a 62-page memorandum, arguing the case for self-government for the Celtic countries to the United Nations Organization and distributed it in 1966 to members of the Council of Europe. \n\nThe League also took a leading part in other campaigns, for example, monitoring submarine activity in the Irish Sea where they refused to surface, snaring fishing nets and causing the loss of boats and lives. Ensuing publicity over the years to these incidents brought the League into the mainstream. Another success was the League's spearheading of a campaign to transfer the ownership of the bird island sanctuary, the Calf of Man, from the English National Trust to the Manx National Trust. The League soon made the idea of Pan-Celticism a public issue and forced the academic Celtic Congress into actions such as adopting a \"Charter of Cultural Rights\". In 1979, a Celtic Film and Television Festival was inaugurated and in 1981 UNESCO launched their permanent \"Project for the Study and Promotion of Celtic Cultures\". Conferences, book fairs, television programmes, and an International Federation of Celtic Wrestling was formed. \n\nThe burgeoning of the Celtic idea came from Heusaff's original vision. Although he resigned office around 1985, he continued to work for the League. As a tribute to his work, The Celtic League published that year a \"festschrift\" in his honour \"For A Celtic Future\", of essays by many leading Celticists, and edited by Cathal Ó Luain, who had become convenor of the League.\n\nUpon his retirement from the Meteorological Service in 1986, Alan and Bríd moved to Seanadh Gharráin, near Spidéal, County Galway, where he concentrated on his lexicographical work, kept up a voluminous correspondence with his Celtic contacts, and remained involved in the League. In July 1990, Heusaff wrote of the future of the League:The Celtic League has a role to play in stimulating Inter Celtic contacts, Inter Celtic solidarity, which could express itself in contributing to pressure on politicians and international/European institutions to steer developments in Europe towards full recognition of the rights of our nations including languages. Other Inter Celtic organizations exist (i.e. Celtic Congress), also Inter Celtic events (Film and Television Festival. Celtic Congress of Writers etc.) – but we are the only association so far working on a continuous or permanent basis. We need to think about what contribution the Celtic peoples and their cultures can make to the development of European unity, to formulate proposals and suggestions, disseminating them, instead of adopting an aloof sort of attitude. We lack people to do this work. Many European peoples have something like an attachment to Celtic matters. I believe we should appeal to them to help to get recognition and the freedom we need to realize our national aims. Our problem is to bring young people to join in the work. The cosmopolitanization of culture, which now rules supreme, the control of the media by the agents of uniformity, are great obstacles to our progress. (19)Before he died, it was arranged that all Heusaff's papers connected with the Celtic League should be deposited in the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, and are classified as \"681, Celtic League Archive\".\n\nHeusaff and his wife were members of Conradh na Gaeilge and involved in Na Teaghlaigh Ghaelacha, an organisation for Irish speaking families. Bríd became a member of the Executive of Conradh na Gaeilge and was very active in Irish language activities. Heusaff took part in Irish language campaigns such as Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta and was the first person to refuse, on principle, to pay a television licence because of Raidió Teilifís Éireann's (RTÉ) neglect of Irish language programmes. This campaign ultimately resulted in the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge (later TG4) in 1996. \n\nIn 1986 Irish President, Patrick Hillery, presented him with the \"Gradam an Phiarsaigh\" annual award for promoting the ideals of Patrick Pearse. Later that year, he was elected as a Bard of the Welsh Gorsedd, as \"Gwenerzh\" (Muse) as having made a distinguished contribution to the Welsh nation, language and culture.(20)\n\nWhile working for the language and culture of his adopted country, Heusaff never ceased to promote the Breton language and the struggle of his native country for independence. He taught Breton language classes in his spare time in Dublin and became a prolific journalist in Breton, editing \"Argoad\", a Breton language news bulletin, with an English edition \"Breton News\", which he founded in 1959. He also contributed to Breton language magazines in Brittany such as \"Hor Yezh\", \"Galva\", \"Breman\", \"Gwalarn\", \"Arvor\", \"Ar Bed Keltiek\", \"An Amzer\" and \"Al Liamm\". The first all-Breton dictionary, \"Geriadur Brezhoneg\", published by An Here in 1995, cited Heusaff as a major contributor. This provoked some protest given renewed controversies in Brittany over his and others' wartime background. Heusaff also published a dictionary of his own dialect of Sant Ivi as \"Geriaoueg Sant Ivi\", initially in the magazine \"Hor Yezh\" between 1962–73. A revised version of the work was issued in book form in 1996.(21)\n\n\n"}

They are just west of the more prominent Jemez Mountains near the town of Cuba, and are separated from them by the Río Guadalupe and the Río de Las Vacas. This article will consider them as a unit together with the San Pedro Mountains, which are a smaller range contiguous with the Sierra Nacimiento on the north, and which are also part of the Nacimiento Uplift and lie at the edge of the greater San Juan Basin, which sits atop the Colorado Plateau. The combined range runs almost due north-south with a length of about 40 mi (65 km). The highest point in the combined range is the high point of the San Pedro Peaks, known unofficially as San Pedro Peak, 10,605 ft (3,232 m).\n\nThe Nacimientos are of some geological interest despite their modest elevation, as they form the western boundary of the Rio Grande Rift, a major rift valley containing the Rio Grande. The corresponding range on the east side of the rift, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is significantly higher and more rugged than the Nacimientos, which consist of long, gentle ridges never reaching above tree line. The Jemez Mountains lie between the Nacimientos and the Sangre de Cristos and are sometimes mistakenly thought to be part of the structure of the rift, but in fact are of volcanic origin rather than part of the graben of which the Nacimientos and Sangre de Cristos are the obvious manifestations.\n\nMuch of the range is within the San Pedro Parks Wilderness area and is protected against development. Hiking trails crisscross the wilderness area, making it a popular destination for backpackers. The range receives more orographic precipitation than many other New Mexico mountains, as there are no higher ranges upwind for a considerable distance. Accordingly, the trails in the wilderness area are frequently soft and soggy for much of the year.

The students, who went on to form LD, wanted a more radical Marxist-Leninist party.\n\nBeginning in 1978 one tendency led by Moussa Kane made contact with the PAI of Majhmout Diop. On March 29 Kane and his followers joined the legal PAI.\n\nLD founded the monthly magazine \"Vérité\".\n\nLD was recognized as a legal political party on July 9, 1981. After legalization it started publishing \"Fagaru\".\n\nIn the late 1970s, LD started advocating the unification of the Marxist left in Senegal into a single party (they proposed the name \"Parti Sénégalais du Travail\"). Thus it later changed its name to LD/MPT.\n\nThe LD/MDT won three seats in the 1993 parliamentary election and joined the Socialist Party-led government in June 1993, during the presidency of Abdou Diouf. The party held two positions in the government. It left the government following the May 1998 parliamentary election, in which it again won three seats. In March 1999, the LD/MPT and two other left-wing parties, And-Jëf/African Party for Democracy and Socialism (AJ/PADS) and the Party of Independence and Labour (PIT), agreed to support the candidacy of opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) in the 2000 presidential election. Wade was victorious in the second round of the 2000 election, and the LD/MPT then joined the first government under Wade, holding two ministries: LD/MPT Secretary-General Abdoulaye Bathily became Minister of Energy and Hydraulics and Yéro Dé became Minister of the Civil Service, Employment and Labor.\n\nIn the 2001 parliamentary election, the LD/MPT was part of the ruling Sopi Coalition (also including the PDS). The LD/MPT won seven seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThe two LD/MPT ministers in the government, Yéro Deh and Seydou Sy Sall (who was Minister of Town Planning and Regional Planning), were dismissed by Wade on March 9, 2005. The party had become highly critical of Wade and the government, and it was accused of violating \"governmental solidarity by constant, unjust and unfounded attacks against the president, his government and his party\". An important factor in this was the opposition of the LD/MPT to an amnesty regarding the 1993 assassination of Constitutional Council vice-president Babacar Sèye. Prior to the dismissal of its ministers, the LD/MPT had already intended to leave the government on April 24.\n\nThe party no longer identifies itself as a communist party.\n\nThe youth wing of LD/MPT is known as Democratic Youth Movement (MDJ).\n\n"}

Awdry, The Other Railway refers to British Railways (later British Rail), the UK nationalised rail organisation that existed from 1948 until 1997.\n\nSeveral of the characters in the books have visited the Other Railway or used it to travel from place to place. Many of the Fat Controller's engines came from the Other Railway originally. There have been several visitors from the Other Railway.\n\nAlthough the fictional North Western Railway (NWR) or Fat Controller's Railway was part of the nationalised railway network it kept most of its operating independence from British Railways on the mainland. This is why it escaped the Beeching cuts in the 1960s.\n\nThe NWR and the Other Railway meet at Barrow-in-Furness and the fictional Island of Sodor is connected to the mainland by a rolling lift bridge between Barrow and Vicarstown.\n\nBR ran an hourly suburban train service from Barrow to Ballahoo and Norramby on Sodor.\n\nThere have been at times direct services from Tidmouth to London Euston or London St Pancras with Other Railway engines taking over at Barrow.\n\nThe Big City Engine, Gordon and Duck were involved in an argument over the confusion between the mainline stations in London. Gordon the Big Engine boasted about going to London, and believed that London was restricted to Kings Cross (served by the London and North Eastern Railway). Duck the Great Western Engine thought that London was Paddington, as he had once worked there as a station pilot (Great Western Railway). The Big City Engine thought that London was Euston (London Midland and Scottish Railway). Unbeknownst to them, they were all correct, but they did not realize, due to being on their own isolated lines before coming to Sodor, that there were a number of stations in London, and that these were merely three of them. Gordon was disappointed to discover when he visited London that the station he visited was London St Pancras.\n\nThe locomotives that have been featured in \"The Railway Series\" are detailed below, although others have been seen in various illustrations.\n\nThe Foreign Engine, also known as The Big City Engine, appears in the story 'Gordon Goes Foreign' in \"The Eight Famous Engines\" in which he debates with Gordon and Duck over the name of the terminus station in London. Gordon claims the station is King's Cross, Duck claims it is Paddington and the Foreign Engine claims it is Euston (Gordon later brings the Express to London and is disappointed to arrive at St Pancras).\n\nThe Foreign Engine is a former London Midland and Scottish Railway locomotive used mainly on the Euston–Glasgow route. He is portrayed in the standard British Railways express passenger locomotive livery of lined green.\n\nThe locomotive is never named in his one appearance. The name \"The Foreign Engine\" was applied by Martin Clutterbuck and is derived from the fact that in the Railway Series, engines not from the Island of Sodor are described as \"foreign\". The name \"The Big City Engine\" was applied by Learning Curve when they produced the character for their range of wooden toys.\n\nLittle Diesel the English Electric/Class 08 was the first diesel engine to arrive on the Island of Sodor. He visited on a trial from The Other Railway in the book \"Duck and the Diesel Engine\" (Vol. 13 in \"The Railway Series\"). He is painted in all-over plain black livery.\n\nDiesel is the Railway Series' first real villain (who turns out as a scheming, oily trickster with a foul temper that likes to cause trouble wherever he goes). He was supposed to help Duck with his shunting, but after humiliating himself in front of the trucks, he spread such mean-spirited rumours about Duck to the other engines that the Fat Controller was compelled to send him away, though Duck being sent away was part of a plan by the Fat Controller, who never trusted Diesel.\n\nDiesel made a brief return in the one-off story \"Thomas and the Evil Diesel\", where he showed that perhaps he did have a good streak buried somewhere deep inside. One of Diesel's brothers appeared in one of the illustrations for \"Thomas and the Great Railway Show\" helping to shunt Thomas onto a lorry.\n\nThe Big Diesel/Diesel 261/Diesel 4711/Class 40 came to Sodor to help out whilst Stepney was on the railway. He did not make a good impression on his arrival, as he told the engines that they should be scrapped and replaced by diesels like him. He soon got his comeuppance when he accidentally sucked a Railway Inspector’s bowler hat into his air intake during a maintenance check, causing him to break down as soon as he started moving towards the train he was supposed to take. He left soon afterwards, saying goodbye to no-one. He also had a cameo appearance in the television series episode \"Rusty to the Rescue\".\n\nHis Railway Series number is entirely fictional and does not correspond to the numbering sequences used for any class of diesel locomotive on British Railways. The television series used the number D261, which would have been correct for a Class 40. It is said that his real number was D261 in \"The Railway Series\" also.\n\nHe made his one and only appearance in \"Stepney the \"Bluebell\" Engine\". In that story, he was referred to as Diesel, but the television series revised his name to \"Class 40\" to avoid confusion with an earlier character by it (although he is still also referred to as the Big Diesel).\n\nD199/\"Spamcan\"/\"Old Reliable\" is a Diesel engine who only appeared in the book \"Enterprising Engines\".\n\nHe visited Sodor on a trial with D7101 (later known as the Bear) and talked about taking over the railway. He and Bear argued, and the other engines took an instant dislike to D199. One afternoon, Henry the Green Engine found D199 moaning near a signal box because he had engine trouble and the signalman called him \"Spamcan\". Henry rescued both the engine and his train, and D199 was soon sent away in disgrace by the Fat Controller. D199 was returned to the British Rail allocations department in London. D199 is based off of a British Rail Class 46 diesel-electric locomotive. The number D199 is fictionial, but would've been real if another six were built as they went from D138 to D193.\n\nAlthough he does not appear in the television series, D199 also appears in the magazine story \"Diesel Day!\", which was published on 16 May 2001.\n\nWhistler Old Stuck-Up is a class 40 diesel who once visited the island. He possibly arrived in 1981 or under, if he's the same diesel as 40125. When he arrived after being shown around by BoCo, he was disgusted to see steam engines in the shed and showed his disdain by calling them \"Dirty, Smoky, Slow Things,\" and causing trouble. In return, the steam engines gave him his unflattering nickname. In the end, as Henry put it, \"Old Stuck-Up came unstuck\" when he slipped on a patch of oil left by BoCo and Bear and crashed through the back wall of the engine shed. He was sent home soon after, never to disturb the steam engines again. Despite his assumed number, his real number was never given.\n\nOld Stuck-Up only appeared in one story, \"Old Stuck-Up\", in the book \"James and the Diesel Engines\".\n\nThe \"Works Diesel\" is an unnamed character who once rescued James after a breakdown, and almost single-handedly changed James' opinion on diesels. He is a friendly sort who lives at Crovan's Gate and works odd jobs around the railway. His first appearance was in \"James and the Diesel Engines\", with his next confirmed one in \"Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree\" as the engine who collected the tree from The Other Railway. He also makes a cameo in \"Henry and the Express\", at Barrow. At first it was unclear if they were one and the same, but Christopher Awdry revealed that the diesel seen in all three books is the \"Works Diesel\".\n\nHe is loaned from British Rail. It is suggested in \"James and the Diesel Engines\" that he is one of a number of new diesels on the railway.\n\nThe \"Works Diesel\" is a reader-applied name; he carries no identifying number and is unnamed throughout the stories.\n\nIn the television series \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\", \"the Other Railway\" is a term used for the railway lines serving the Sodor Ironworks and the China Clay Quarry. It was here that Rusty the Diesel rescued Stepney from being broken up for scrap, as did Douglas with Oliver the Western Engine. It is described as \"a faraway part of the Island where only the diesels work\". These days, 'Arry and Bert, the ironworks diesels, work around there. Its scrapyard has been seen in seasons 6-7 known as the Smelters Yard.\n\nDespite having never appeared in the Thomas & Friends television series, the characters Bear and the Big City Engine have nevertheless been included in commercial merchandising lines based on the series, alongside other Railway characters. In the case of the Big City Engine, the character was not known by this name until Learning Curve released the model in their wooden railway range.\n"}

It was built in 1840 by the Stephensons for the North Midland Railway.\n\nWhen finished, it was long.\n\nThe west side of the Derwent valley has a number of gritstone outcrops, one being Burley Hill to the south of Duffield, another being Castle Hill in Duffield itself. The valley here however was too narrow, and already occupied by the village of Milford from which the tunnel gets its name, and one of Jedediah Strutt's cotton mills.\n\nThe name Chevin has Celtic origins, but the hill is often called Firestone Hill, for the spot on which the beacon fires were lighted to rouse the country when peril of invasion or other dangers were imminent.\n\nFor some reason the North Midland built very ornate portals at the northern ends of their tunnels, in this case a Saxon-inspired arch, while the southern ends were relatively plain. The north portal was originally set into a surrounding area of random stonework, which has become totally overgrown. It is expected that the effect of trimming back the vegetation as part of the electrification project will have the effect of restoring it to its former appearance. Both portals are grade 2 listed, being part of the Derwent Valley World Heritage site.\n\nAt the summit of the hill there was built a substantial tower, which still exists, the purpose of which has been a matter for speculation. It has generally been thought that it was to check the alignment of the tunnel construction, and was equipped with a rotating telescope. It has been pointed out that such a facility appeared with no other tunnel of the time and there is an alternative theory that it was concerned with supervising the passage of trains through the tunnel. In effect an early experiment with a form of block working, instead of the time interval system commonly used.\n\nWhen the Midland Railway upgraded the line to four tracks south of the tunnel, a signal box was installed to control the junction of the goods and passenger lines, also providing warning distant signals at the north entrance.\n"}

She graduated from Brookwood High School in Snellville, Georgia, and from the University of Georgia with high honors in broadcast journalism. She was 4th runner-up in the 1995 Miss Georgia pageant.\n\nRobach worked at WTTG in Washington, D.C., then came to MSNBC in 2003 where she spent four years, including a stint anchoring two hours in the morning, and filling in on \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" and \"Morning Joe\". She was named co-anchor of \"Weekend Today\" in July 2007.

She continues to work on “GMA” as a breaking-news anchor, shipping out to cover major news, such as natural disasters, in the field.\n\nOn November 2, 2019, Project Veritas released a late August 2019 \"hot mic\" incident in which Robach discusses ABC shutting down her story on billionaire convicted sex offender and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in 2015. Robach's comments came just two days after an NPR story disclosed the existence of an on-camera interview with Virginia Roberts Giuffre and ABC's failure to broadcast it. Giuffre says she was sexually trafficked by Epstein to powerful men including Prince Andrew — a claim the Duke of York has strenuously denied. In a \"hot mic\" video, Robach was recorded on set for ABC's \"Good Morning America\" voicing the following statements:\n\n\"I've had the story for three years,\" Robach says in the video. \"We would not put it on the air. Um, first of all, I was told, 'Who was Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.' Then the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways.\" Robach goes on to say that Giuffre alluded to others in the interview, including former President Bill Clinton, Harvard University law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz and Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre has made similar accusations against all of them also in court documents. (All deny any wrongdoing or involvement in Epstein's sex trafficking.) Giuffre has said in court papers that she saw Clinton in Epstein's presence but did not witness Clinton participate in any sexual activity.\n\n\"I tried for three years to get it out to no avail, and now these new revelations and — I freaking had all of it,\" Robach says on the tape. \"I'm so pissed right now. Like, every day I get more and more pissed, 'cause I'm just like, 'Oh my God! It was — what we had, was unreal.' \"\n\nRobach responded to the leaked video with this statement: \"As a journalist, as the Epstein story continued to unfold last summer, I was caught in a private moment of frustration. I was upset that an important interview I had conducted with Virginia Roberts didn’t air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC’s editorial standards about her allegations. My comments about Prince Andrew and her allegation that she had seen Bill Clinton on Epstein's private island were in reference to what Virginia Roberts said in that interview in 2015. I was referencing her allegations—not what ABC News had verified through our reporting. The interview itself, while I was disappointed it didn't air, didn't meet our standards. In the years since no one ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein, and we have continued to aggressively pursue this important story.\" \n\nABC News issued a statement, asserting: \"At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since, we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it. That work has led to a two-hour documentary and 6-part podcast that will air in the new year.\"\n\nRobach is a cousin of former \"Nashville Star\" contestant Matt Lindahl. Her aunt and uncle were performing-arts teachers at her high school.\n\nRobach was married to Tim McIntosh from 1996 until filing for an uncontested divorce in 2008.

Robach has three stepsons from her marriage to Andrew Shue, Nate (1997) Aidan (1999) and Wyatt (2004).\n\nOn November 11, 2013, Robach revealed on \"Good Morning America\" that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer after receiving a mammogram on live television on October 1, 2013, and after undergoing follow-up tests. She took time off from broadcasting to undergo a bilateral mastectomy. On November 22, 2013, Robach revealed that during the surgery, doctors found a second malignant tumor in her other breast and that the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes (classified as Stage IIB). She then underwent eight rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and reconstructive surgery.\n\n\n"}

Gazipaşa is a quiet rural district famous for its bananas, oranges and international airport of Gazipaşa Airport (IATA shortkey GZP). Gazipaşa district is adjacent to Alanya to the west, Sarıveliler to the north and Anamur to the east.\n\nThe district of Gazipaşa stands on a narrow strip of coast between the Mediterranean Sea and the high Taurus Mountains rising steeply behind (highest point the 2253m \"Deliktaş\". Prehistoric animal remains (shelled sea animals) can be found at many locations in the mountains. Before these were the Taurus Mountains (Paleozoic Age) these peaks were below the sea. \nThe coast road is winding Alanya, but good with four lanes in places making Gazipaşa easy to access from Antalya and Alanya. From Gazipaşa east the road is two lanes but in the process of being improved to four. It is 80 km to the next town Anamur which takes two hours to drive). The remote rocky hillsides are home to snakes, scorpions and other wildlife such as deer, rabbits, wild boar, wild sheep and badgers. There is 50 km of coastline, half of which is sandy beach and rocky stretches with small coves that can be used for swimming. The beaches of Gazipaşa are used as nesting grounds by loggerhead sea turtles. Construction is forbidden in these sea turtle areas.\n\nThe local economy depends on agriculture and the land of the coastal strip is used for growing fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits and bananas. The mountainous areas have many fruit orchards and in recent years a large number of glasshouses have been built to produce crops such as cucumbers, strawberries and artichokes all year round in both locations. Some grain is grown and there is also much animal husbandry animals in the summer these animals are grazed higher in the mountains. Gazipasa has a dam (Gökçeler Barajı). There is also some forestry and fishing but only small industry. The local council is controlled by the centre-right AKP. Its current mayor is Adil Çelik.\n\nGazipaşa has not experienced the tourist boom of neighbouring Alanya but there are now efforts being made to attract tourists to the district by building a yacht marina and an international airport. Tourist attractions include some sites from antiquity, caves, beaches, the opportunity to appreciate the marvellous Taurus Mountain scenery with mountain walking or motor touring.\n\nThe new Gazipaşa Airport will serve the tourist economies of Alanya, Anamur and Yeşilöz.\n\nThis is a part of the world with a long history, and there is evidence of Hittite settlement going back to 2000 BC, and it is assumed that this coast was settled long before that. The Ancient Greek city of Selinus was established here on the River Kestros (today called \"Hacımusa\") by 628 BC, as part of the kingdom of Cilicia. In 197 BC the area passed into the hands of the Ancient Romans, and in the 2nd century AD the Emperor Trajan died here after falling ill while journeying along the Mediterranean coast. His body was taken by his successor Hadrian for burial in Rome and for a period the town was named \"Traianapolis\".\n\nThe later Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) continued to rule the area until it was taken by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who lost the area to the Seljuk Turks of `Ala' ad-Din Kay-Qubad in 1225. Selinus was retaken briefly by Armenians before the conquest of Karamanids in the end of the 13th century. During the area of the Anatolian beyliks the coast including Selinti was controlled by the Karamanid clan of Konya and was brought into the Ottoman Empire in 1472 by Gedik Ahmet Pasha, naval commander of Sultan Mehmet II. The 17th century traveller Evliya Çelebi records Selinti as a group of 26 villages, with a well-kept mosque on the seafront along with a jetty for boats to Cyprus, and green mountains behind.\n\nArchaeological research continues and in 2004 a team from Florida State University found a small bronze statue of Pegasus dating back to 300 BC in the waters off Gazipaşa; it is now in the Museum of Alanya.\n\nWe can list the castles in Gazipasa as Selinus, Iotape, Lamos (Adanda), Nephelis and Antiochia ad Cragum.\n\nGazipaşa is twinned with:\n\n"}

It was the largest prison escape of World War II, as well as one of the bloodiest. During the escape and ensuing manhunt, 4 Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining escapees were re-captured and imprisoned.\n\nSituated some due west of Sydney, Cowra was the town nearest to No. 12 Prisoner of War Compound, a major POW camp where 4,000 Axis military personnel and civilians were detained throughout World War II. The prisoners at Cowra also included 2,000 Italians, Koreans (who had served in the Japanese military), and Indonesian civilians, detained at the request of the Dutch East Indies government.\n\nBy August 1944, there were 2,223 Japanese POWs in Australia, including 544 merchant seamen. There were also 14,720 Italian prisoners, the majority of whom had been captured in the North African Campaign, as well as 1,585 Germans, most of whom were captured naval or merchant seamen.\n\nAlthough the POWs were treated in accordance with the 1929 Geneva Convention, relations between the Japanese POWs and the guards were poor, due largely to significant cultural differences. A riot by Japanese POWs at Featherston prisoner of war camp in New Zealand, in February 1943, led to security being tightened at Cowra.\n\nEventually the camp authorities installed several Vickers and Lewis machine guns to augment the rifles carried by the members of the Australian Militia's 22nd Garrison Battalion, which was composed mostly of old or disabled veterans or young men considered physically unfit for frontline service.\n\nIn the first week of August 1944, a tip-off from an informer at Cowra led authorities to plan a move of all Japanese POWs at Cowra, except officers and NCOs, to another camp at Hay, New South Wales, some to the west. The Japanese were notified of the move on 4 August.\n\nIn the words of historian Gavin Long, the following night:\n\nThe bugler, Hajime Toyoshima, had been Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the war. Soon afterwards, prisoners set most of the buildings in the Japanese compound on fire.\n\nWithin minutes of the start of the breakout attempt, Privates Ben Hardy and Ralph Jones manned the No. 2 Vickers machine-gun and began firing into the first wave of escapees. They were soon overwhelmed by a wave of Japanese prisoners who had breached the lines of barbed wire fences. Before dying, Private Hardy managed to remove and throw away the gun's bolt, rendering the gun useless. This prevented the prisoners from turning the machine gun against the guards.\n\nSome 359 POWs escaped, while some others attempted or committed suicide, or were killed by their countrymen. Some of those who did escape also committed suicide to avoid recapture. All the survivors were recaptured within 10 days of their breakout.\n\nDuring the escape and subsequent round-up of POWs, four Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers were killed and 108 prisoners were wounded. The leaders of the breakout ordered the escapees not to attack Australian civilians, and none were killed or injured.\n\nThe government conducted an official inquiry into the events. Its conclusions were read to the Australian House of Representatives by Prime Minister John Curtin on 8 September 1944. Among the findings were:\n\n\nPrivates Hardy and Jones were posthumously awarded the George Cross as a result of their actions.\n\nA fifth Australian, Thomas Roy Hancock of C Company 26 Battalion V.D.C. was accidentally shot by another volunteer while dismounting from a vehicle, in the process of deploying to protect railways and bridges from the escapees. Hancock later died of sepsis.\n\nAustralia continued to operate No. 12 Camp until the last Japanese and Italian prisoners were repatriated in 1947.\nCowra maintains a significant Japanese war cemetery, the only such cemetery in Australia. In addition, the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre, a commemorative Japanese garden, was later built on Bellevue Hill to memorialize these events. The garden was designed by Ken Nakajima in the style of the Edo period.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2067974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067974", "title": "Chuao", "text": "Chuao\n\nChuao is a small village located in the northern coastal range mountains of Venezuela, founded in 1660. The village is famous for its cacao plantations, Diablos danzantes and San Juaneras. The village is surrounded by mountains and dense rainforests to the south and the Caribbean Sea to the north. The nearby Henri Pittier National Park is the oldest national park in Venezuela, created in 1937. The village is only accessible by travelling via boat from nearby Choroní, and is approximately 4 kilometers inland.\n\nChuao's name derives from an indigenous word from a local language which is related to the term water.\n\nWhile cocoa production in the site of Chuao can be traced back to 1591, the town itself was founded in 1660. From 1591 onwards, the area was home to a number of haciendas which grew cocoa. During colonial times, a number of slaves were imported to the village from Africa to increase cocoa production on said haciendas.\n\nChuao was one of the sites of the Macuto Bay raid, in which a small number of forces hired by American mercenary company Silvercorp USA attempted a naval invasion of Venezuela. Upon landing in Chuao, the attackers, which included two Americans, were detained.\n\nThe village of Chuao subsists largely on fishing and cocoa production.\n\nChuao is home to a number of cocoa plantations, dating back to 1591, which grow Criollo and hybrid varieties of cacao. Chuao beans are regarded as being high in quality and, as a result, very expensive, fetching between 9 and 13 US Dollars per kilogram. Beans from Chuao are considered some of Venezuela's finest, along with Porcelana Blanca beans from Lake Maracaibo. The Chuao region is hemmed in by mountains which reduces contact with people and insects from other areas. Some experts attribute the high quality of the cacao beans of Chuao due to the intense work of the village's laborers during the pre harvest, harvest and post harvest.Annual, Chuao's cocoa production hovers around 20 tons, but has varied from approximately 17 to 25 tons in recent years. In November 2000, the Chuao cacao beans were awarded an appellation of origin under the title \"Cacao de Chuao\", allowing producers to negotiate higher prices and attract investment.\n\nThe Farmer's Company of Chuao () is the worker's cooperative which operates the cocoa plantations of Chuao. The cooperative has 127 members, most of whom are female.\n\nThe cooperative has sold their beans to a number of foreign firms, such as Valrhona and Amedei, before forming an exclusive partnership with Tisano, a Venezuelan partner, in 2014. The partership sels 99% of its cocoa to foreign buyers. Through this partnership, the cooperative, alongside other chocolate makers, have implemented a Traceability Certificate to ensure that only the Chuao beans that were harvested in the Chuao village make it into chocolate bars that are marketed as Chuao origin. This traceability certificate assigns 1.020 kg per harvest and a unique serial number to each chocolate maker.\n\nThe cooperative has benefitted largely from an increased global appetite for high-quality chocolate in recent years, which has helped its members earn a high standard of living. The worker's cooperative has been touted by the Venezuelan government as an \"example of socialism\". The cooperative has invested heavily in the villlage, building schools and medical infrastructure. However, The Guardian reported that those in Chuao who are not members of the cooperative are discontent with power it has over village life.\n\nCentral Venezuela is home to a unique tradition regarding the Corpus Christi celebration, in which young men and children partake in Los Diablos Danzantes, which depicts masked devils surrendering to a church official. The dancers who partake in this festival become members of a lifelong pact, known as the promise-keepers, to transmit their history and traditions to others. In 2012, this tradition was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe other column of the Chuao village are Las San Juaneras this is the group of ladies that take care of the beautiful church in the town square, lead most religious celebration specially the party of San Juan which is celebrated every year to thank San Juan for a good cacao harvest.\n"}
{"id": "2067976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067976", "title": "Rexford Tugwell", "text": "Rexford Tugwell\n\nRexford Guy Tugwell (July 10, 1891 – July 21, 1979) was an economist who became part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's first \"Brain Trust\", a group of Columbia University academics who helped develop policy recommendations leading up to Roosevelt's New Deal. Tugwell served in FDR's administration until he was forced out in 1936. He was a specialist on planning and believed the government should have large-scale plans to move the economy out of the Great Depression because private businesses were too frozen in place to do the job. He helped design the New Deal farm program and the Resettlement Administration that moved subsistence farmers into small rented farms under close supervision. His ideas on suburban planning resulted in the construction of Greenbelt, Maryland, with low-cost rents for relief families. He was denounced by conservatives for advocating state-directed economic planning to overcome the Great Depression.\n\nRoosevelt appointed Tugwell as Governor of Puerto Rico during World War II (1941–1946). He became a professor at various universities, with lengthy service at the University of Chicago and the University of California at Santa Barbara. He wrote twenty books, covering the politics of the New Deal, biographies of major politicians, issues in planning, and memoirs of his experiences.\n\nRexford Tugwell was born in 1891 in Sinclairville, New York. In his youth, he gained an appreciation for workers’ rights and liberal politics from the works of Upton Sinclair, James Bryce, Edward Bellamy, Frederick Winslow Taylor, and Charles Richard van Hise. Tugwell began studying economics in graduate work at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and completed his doctorate at Columbia University. At university, he was influenced by the teaching of Scott Nearing and Simon Patten, as well as the writings of John Dewey in philosophy.\n\nAfter graduation, Tugwell served as junior faculty at the University of Washington, American University in Paris, and Columbia University. At Columbia University he taught economics from 1920 to 1932. \n\nTugwell's approach to economics was experimentalist, and he viewed the industrial planning of World War I as a successful experiment. He advocated agricultural planning (led by industry) to stop the rural poverty that had become prevalent due to a crop surplus after the First World War. This method of controlling production, prices, and costs was especially relevant as the Great Depression began.\n\nIn 1932 Tugwell was invited to join President Franklin Roosevelt's team of advisers known as the Brain Trust. After Roosevelt's inauguration in 1933, Tugwell was appointed first as Assistant Secretary and then in 1934 as Undersecretary of the United States Department of Agriculture. He helped create the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) and served as its director. The AAA included a domestic allotment program, which paid farmers to voluntarily reduce their production by roughly 30% so that reduced supply would increase the price they received. It was funded with a tax on processing companies that used farm commodities. Tugwell's department managed the production of key crops by adjusting the subsidies for non-production. The act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1936 in \"United States v. Butler\", and had to be replaced in 1938.\n\nTugwell was also instrumental in creating the Soil Conservation Service in 1933, to restrict cultivation, restore poor-quality land, and introduce better agricultural practices to farmers to conserve the soil. This was especially necessary given the widespread damage of the 1930s' Dust Bowls. He additionally played a key role in crafting the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nIn April 1935 Tugwell and Roosevelt created the Resettlement Administration (RA), a unit of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Directed by Tugwell, the RA sought to create healthy communities for the rural unemployed by relocating them to new communities for access to urban opportunities. Some of the RA's activities dealt with land conservation and rural aid, but the construction of new suburban satellite cities was the most prominent. In her book, \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities,\" the author Jane Jacobs critically quotes Tugwell on the program: \"My idea is to go just outside centers of population, pick up cheap land, build a whole community and entice people into it. Then go back into the cities and tear down whole slums and make parks of them.\" She believed that he underestimated the strengths of complex urban communities and caused too much social displacement in \"tearing down\" neighborhoods that might have been renovated. This resulted in greater damage to inner city neighborhoods.\n\nThe RA completed three \"Greenbelt\" towns before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the program unconstitutional in \"Franklin Township v. Tugwell.\" It ruled that housing construction was a state power, and the RA was an illegal delegation of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration's power.\n\nTugwell had previously been denounced as \"Rex the Red\". The RA's suburban resettlement program earned him condemnation as Communist and un-American because of its social planning aspects. Historians agree he was at all times a loyal American and was never affiliated in any way with the Communist Party.\nGiven the opposition to his policies, Tugwell resigned from the Roosevelt administration at the end of 1936. He was appointed as a vice president at the American Molasses Co. At this time, he divorced his first wife and married Grace Falke, his former assistant.\n\nIn 1938 Tugwell was appointed as the first director of the New York City Planning Commission. New York's reformist mayor, Fiorello LaGuardia, created the commission as part of a city charter reform aimed at reducing corruption and inefficiency. The Planning Commission had relatively limited powers: all actions needed approval from the legislative Board of Estimate. Tugwell tried to assert the commission's power. He tried to retroactively enforce nonconforming land uses, despite a lack of public or legal support. His commission sought to establish public housing at moderate densities, yet repeatedly approved FHA requests for greater density. Robert Moses killed Tugwell's proposed fifty-year master plan with a fiery public denouncement of its open-space protections.\n\nTugwell served as the last appointed American Governor of Puerto Rico, from 1941 to 1946. He worked with the legislature to create the Puerto Rico Planning, Urbanization, and Zoning Board in 1942. Tugwell supported Puerto Rican self-government through amendment to the Organic Act in 1948 but fiercely opposed decentralizing government agencies and services away from the city of San Juan \"despite most Puerto Ricans in need of such services not residing in the capital.\" In one case, he vetoed a bill approved by both chambers of the Puerto Rico Legislature, and supported by 59 of 77 municipalities, establishing a state medical school in the city of Ponce, calling it \"regionalism.\" He publicly supported Luis Muñoz Marín's Popular Democratic Party, which wanted a Commonwealth status.\n\nAs he prepared to retire from the Governorship, Tugwell was instrumental in getting the first Puerto Rican appointed to the job, Jesús T. Piñero, then serving as Resident Commissioner in Washington, D.C. Tugwell also served as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter his stint as governor, Tugwell returned to teaching at a variety of institutions. He had years of service at the University of Chicago, where he helped develop their planning program. He moved to Greenbelt, Maryland, one of the new suburbs designed and built by the Resettlement Administration under his direction.\n\nAfter the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Tugwell believed that global planning was the only sure way to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. He participated in the Committee to Frame a World Constitution from 1945 to 1948. He also thought the national constitution needed to be amended to enable economic planning.\n\nIn 1948, Tugwell served as chair of the platform committee for the Progressive Party. During its convention (July 23–25, 1948), he recounted a conversation with presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt in 1942 during which FDR warned him of internal clashes that might destroy the Democratic Party but might also create a \"Progressive Party,\" adding in his own words that Roosevelt \"would have led a movement like that which we now join.\" Tugwell pled for party unity under a platform that the \"New York Times\" summed up as \"endorsing Red foreign policy.\"\n\nLate in life, he drafted a constitution for the Newstates of America. In it, Planning would become a new branch of federal government, alongside the Regulatory and Electoral branches.\n\nDuring this time, Tugwell wrote several books, including a biography of Grover Cleveland, subtitled: \"A Biography of the President Whose Uncompromising Honesty and Integrity Failed America in a Time of Crisis\" (1968). His biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt was entitled \"FDR: An Architect of an Era.\" \"A Stricken Land\" was his memoir about his years in Puerto Rico. This book was reprinted in 2007 by the Muñoz Marín Foundation.\n\n\n\nTugwell also wrote the foreword to Edward C. Banfield's first published work, \"Government Project\" (Free Press, 1951), a history of one of Tugwell's collective farm programs in California.\n\nTugwell's autobiographies include \"The Light of Other Days\" (1962), \"To the Lesser Heights of Morningside\" (1982), \"The Stricken Land\" (1947), \"A Chronicle of Jeopardy\" (1955), \"The Brains Trust\" (1968), \"Off Course\" (1971), and \"Roosevelt's Revolution: The First Year, a Personal Perspective\" (1977).\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 novels, and his previous role as games designer for Games Workshop. He is currently working as a Senior Writer at Riot Games.\n\nMcNeill was born in Glasgow, Scotland and studied architecture and building surveying at Glasgow Caledonian University from 1989–1996. In 1996 he started work in an architects’ office designing new flats and commercial properties, until he saw an advertisement for a writer in the December 1999 copy of White Dwarf.\n\nIn February 2000, Graham started work for Games Workshop as a staff writer for games development, writing articles for White Dwarf and army-specific books. In May 2000 he started writing for the \"Warhammer 40,000\" team, but has also kept up writing articles for White Dwarf. Graham has been heavily involved working on codexes, especially \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Tau\" (Chambers et al., 2001) between late 2000 and June 2001. Other codexes he has been involved with are \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Necrons\" (Chambers et al., 2002), \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Chaos Space Marines\" (Games Workshop Design Staff, 2002), \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Imperial Guard\" (Chambers et al., 2003) and \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Daemonhunters\" (McNeill and Haines, 2003). Since a promotion from staff writer to games developer, he has written \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Witch Hunters\" (McNeill et al., 2003) and \"Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Space Marines\" (Chambers, 2004).\n\nGraham is an avid writer and has had several novels published by The Black Library. They are \"Nightbringer\" (McNeill, 2005) published in January 2002, \"Storm of Iron\" (McNeill, 2003) in July 2002, \"Warriors of Ultramar\" (McNeill, 2004a) in February 2003 and \"Dead Sky Black Sun\" (McNeill, 2004). In addition McNeill has written \"The Ambassador,\" a Warhammer novel, in November 2003, \"The Ambassador Chronicles\" in July 2005, \"Guardians of the Forest\" in September 2005.\nHis most recent works have been \"False Gods\" (McNeill, 2006), published in June 2006, \"Fulgrim\" (McNeill, 2007), published in July 2007,and \"Mechanicum\" (McNeill, 2008), the three of which are part of the Black Library's Horus Heresy novel series. Another part to McNeill's story about the Ultramarines, \"The Killing Ground\", was released in May 2008. Early 2009 saw the release of his first novel outside of the Black Library, \"I, Mengsk\" (McNeill, 2009), set in Blizzard Entertainment's \"StarCraft\" universe. The novel tells the tale of three generations of the Mengsk family - Angus and his revolutionary activities, his son Arcturus and his rise to power (leading up to the events of the first game), and Arcturus' son Valerian as he struggles to embrace his family's legacy (leading up to the events of the ).\n\nIn April 2009, Graham also contributed to the anthology book \"Tales of Heresy\" with a story entitled \"The Last Church\", one of the first stories in the Black Library imprint in which the Emperor spoke directly and at length, rather than described from afar as had so far been the case in the Horus Heresy series. Early in 2010, Graham then released \"A Thousand Sons\", a Horus Heresy novel focusing on the Thousand Sons legion and their fall from the graces of the Emperor by the hand of the Space Wolves. This novel was written in sync with a novel due to be released in early 2011 by Dan Abnett, titled \"Prospero Burns\", which tells the same narrative from the opposite perspective.\n\nGraham worked closely with Abnett on the two novels, ensuring they met at certain points and would not contradict one another. This planning was rewarded when, a month after \"A Thousand Sons\" was published, it not only reached the top of the UK science fiction charts (displacing a long-held spot by the novels of Charlaine Harris), but soon entered at number 22 on the \"New York Times\" Bestseller List, cementing his reputation as a writer of high-standard tie-in fiction.\n\nGraham plays both \"Warhammer 40,000\", in which he plays with both Tau and Necron armies, he started with The Ultramarines, and \"Warhammer\", in which he plays an Empire army.\n\nIn 2011, Graham wrote his first novel for Fantasy Flight Games (known for a wide range of roleplaying games, card games, and board games), \"Ghouls of the Miskatonic\", the first story of the \"Dark Waters Trilogy\", based on FFG's Arkham Horror board game and thus closely linked to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nIn June 2015 Graham accepted a job offer from Riot Games, the developing studio of the popular video game League of Legends, after visiting their main office in West Los Angeles in December 2014. As one of the company's Senior Narrative Writers, Graham is developing backstories and lore for individual characters of the game and the in-game world.

Cuthbert was the son of Robert Cunyngham / Cunningham , 2nd Earl of Glencairn, 3rd Lord of Kilmaurs by his wife Elizabeth Lindsay, daughter of Lord Lindsay of Byers.\n\nWhile still Lord Kilmaurs, this nobleman was one of the principal adherents of the English Court in Scotland, and accepted a pension from King Henry VIII. He was one of the party which joined the force of the Earls of Arran and Lennox on 23 November 1524, when they took possession of Edinburgh, and endeavoured to withdraw the young king James V from the Queen Mother.\n\nHe was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland on 26 June 1526 but held the office only until 29 October the same year.\n\nIn 1538 he accompanied David Bethune, Bishop of Mirepoix, afterwards a celebrated cardinal, to France to conclude a treaty for James V's marriage with Mary of Guise.\n\nLord Kilmaurs succeeded as 4th Earl of Glencairn upon the death of his father just before 1542, and he and his eldest son, Alexander, now Lord Kilmaurs, were engaged in all the intrigues of the Anglo-Scottish Party at this period of history, and supported the religious Reformers.\n\nIn 1542 the earl was taken prisoner by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss and committed to the custody of the Duke of Norfolk, but was released on payment of a ransom of a thousand pounds and subscribing by his own hand to support Henry VIII's project of a marriage between the young Prince Edward and the Scottish Queen. In March 1543 he met with the English ambassador Ralph Sadler and the Earl of Angus at the Blackfriar's Monastery in Edinburgh. Sadler interrogated the Scottish earls on the progress they had made on Henry VIII's projects. Glencairn said he had little silver, but would willingly fight France with 5000 men for Henry. Later on the same day, Glencairn offered to put his promises in writing, and at night he brought them to Sadler. Glencairn added that if he was appointed a keeper of Mary, Queen of Scots, Henry would be sure to have her in his hands one way or another.\n\nAllied with the Earl of Lennox in 1544 he was, with his 500 vassals as spearmen, attacked on Glasgow Muir by Regent Arran and defeated \"with great slaughter\", his second son amongst the slain. Glencairn managed to flee to Dumbarton, almost alone, and in September he and his son Lord Kilmaurs abandoned the cause of Henry. In November Glencairn, now pardoned by the Regent, was with the latter's army that laid siege to Coldingham, then held by the English, but which was dispersed by an English force from Berwick.\n\nIn March 1544 Glencairn and his son renewed their communications with the English government in support of the English Party in Scotland, and is said to have been party to the assassination of Cardinal Bethune. Glencairn died in March 1548, and was then receiving a French pension for loyalty to the Auld Alliance.\n\nWilliam Cunningham was twice married, firstly to Catherine Borthwick, second daughter of William Borthwick, 3rd Lord Borthwick, and had issue with her: \n\nHe married secondly to Margaret (or Elizabeth) Campbell, daughter and heiress of John Campbell of West Loudon.\n\n\n\n"}

He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the \"canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook\" \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\", and as Editor-in-Chief of \"Science\" magazine.\n\nAlberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005. He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.\nHe has stated that \"Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements.\" He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge.\n\nAfter graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major. Bored by assigned laboratory \"cooking classes\", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA, and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics. He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.\n\nAlberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an \"enormously ambitious\" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase. After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965. His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966. Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes. \"That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA. This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.\n\nIn 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976. At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.\n\nIn 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.\n\nAlberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980. From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.\n\nAlberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.\n\nAlberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools. He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the \"National Science Education Standards\" (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and \"Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards\" (NRC, 2000)\n\nThe Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.\n\nHe has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council. Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.\n\nHe served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009. He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider \"systemic flaws\" and have created the \"Rescuing Biomedical Research\" organization, to \"collect and organize input for solutions\" to the problems identified by themselves and others.\n\nAlberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, \"Science\" for five years from 2008-2013. He is one of the founding editors of the journal \"Cell Biology Education\".\n\nSince 2013, Alberts has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nFrom 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.\n\nIn his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a \"new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.\" In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.\n\nAlberts has had a productive research career in the field of DNA replication and cell division. His textbook, \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\",\nnow in its sixth edition, is the standard cell biology textbook in most universities; the \"fourth edition\" is freely available from National Center for Biotechnology Information Bookshelf. This book and its counterpart for undergraduate students,\n\"Essential Cell Biology],\" have been translated into multiple languages.\n\nAlberts was awarded the National Medal of Science \"for intellectual leadership and experimental innovation in the field of DNA replication, and for unparalleled dedication to improving science education and promoting science-based public policy.\"\n\nAlberts has received many awards and honours, including the following:\n\n"}

Abrams also created and hosts \"Court Cam,\" a Law&Crime Production on A&E which was the #1 cable show on Thursday nights in 2019. He is a legal commentator, author, and former anchor of \"Nightline\". Abrams also worked as the chief legal correspondent and analyst for NBC News and general manager of MSNBC, and doubled as an anchor for the same network. \n\nDaniel Abrams was born in Manhattan, the son of Efrat and attorney Floyd Abrams. He is a 1984 graduate of Riverdale Country School. Abrams received his B.A. \"cum laude\" in political science from Duke University in 1988. While at Duke, he anchored newscasts on the student-run channel Cable 13 and was vice president of the student body. Abrams received a J.D. from Columbia Law School.\n\nAbrams worked as a reporter for Court TV from May 1994 to June 1997, where he covered the OJ Simpson case, the International War Crimes Tribunal from the Netherlands, and the assisted-suicide trials of Dr. Jack Kevorkian from Michigan.\n\nAfter leaving Court TV, Abrams was a general assignment correspondent for NBC News from 1997 to 1999 at which time he was named Chief Legal Correspondent. Abrams then began hosting his own show at MSNBC, and \"The Abrams Report\" began in 2001. Abrams hosted \"The Abrams Report\" until he accepted the lead managerial position at MSNBC. Abrams held the position of General Manager of MSNBC from June 12, 2006 until October 2007. Abrams left to concentrate on his 9pm show \"Live with Dan Abrams\", which replaced \"Scarborough Country\" due to Joe Scarborough's move to mornings. This show would eventually be revamped and renamed \"Verdict with Dan Abrams\", which aired until August 21, 2008. MSNBC announced on August 19, 2008 that Air America Radio host Rachel Maddow would take over that 9 p.m. time slot beginning September 8, 2008. At that time, Abrams took on additional duties with NBC News including substituting as an anchor on the \"Today\" show.\n\nIn March 2011, Abrams left NBC to become the Chief Legal Analyst for ABC News and a substitute anchor on \"Good Morning America\". ABC announced in June 2013 that Abrams would become the network's Chief Legal Affairs Anchor, as well as an anchor of \"Nightline\". He stepped down from his full time role as \"Nightline\" anchor in December 2014 to focus on his expanding media businesses and returned to his freelance role as the network’s Chief Legal Analyst.\n\nAs of October 2016, Abrams hosts the A&E show \"Live PD\", which follows police officers live across the United States as they patrol their communities. Using dash-cam footage, handheld low-light-capable cameras, and fixed-camera rigs, Abrams analyzes each incident with analysts Tom Morris Jr. and Sean \"Sticks\" Larkin as the police work occurs. He is co-host of A&E'S discussion show \"Grace vs. Abrams\", in which Abrams and legal commentator Nancy Grace debate high-profile crime cases.\n\nIn July 2009, Abrams launched Mediaite, a news site he described as \"appreciating the celebrity of the media.\" The site combines editorial content with analytic rankings of media personalities. In mid-2015, it had over 7 million unique visitors per month.\n\nIn 2016, Abrams launched LawNewz, a legal news website which also live streams trials as part of its online network. The new live trial network, slated as the new Court TV, launched on February 24, 2017, with A&E Networks taking a stake in the site. On November 13, 2017, LawNewz was rebranded to Law & Crime and is available on most OTT platforms in the United States.\n\nIn 2011, Abrams Media launched The Mary Sue, a sister site to Geekosystem with the goal of \"highlighting women in the geek world, and providing a prominent place for the voices of geek women.\" Based on its rapid growth and high engagement, in 2014, Abrams folded Geekosystem into The Mary Sue.\n\nOn October 15, 2018, Abrams tweeted about his latest media service, Ambo TV, a Christian TV streaming service “dedicated to broadcasting Christian sermons with an in-studio discussion.” It was announced that the service would be available to the public in November, 2018. The station will be located at new studios built especially for Ambo TV at Abrams Media studios in Herald Square in New York City and will feature live programming on the weekends.\n\nLater that month, Abrams and Michael Lewittes launched Gossip Cop, a media watchdog site that patrols the celebrity gossip universe. The site has been described by its designer, Rex Sorgatz, as \"TMZ meets Smoking Gun\". The site rates gossip rumors on a 0–10 scale. For the month of May 2013, the site reported over 8 million unique visitors.\n\nThe first official \"offspring\" of flagship site Mediaite, Geekosystem was launched on January 25, 2010. Geekosystem covered \"geek\" culture, following developments in science, technology, as well as internet memes and Internet culture. Abrams described the site upon launch as \"a broader interest site that will celebrate and cover everything from technology and science fiction to video games and comics.\"\n\nAbrams's foray into fashion, Styleite, was launched on March 25, 2010. Functioning for fashion the way Mediaite does for journalism, Styleite launched with both news and opinion content as well as a fashion version of the \"Power Grid,\" which ranks designers, models, writers, and others in the style business based on influence and following. Abrams rebranded Styleite as Runway Riot in 2015, appointing model Iskra Lawrence as managing editor. RunwayRiot.com is marketed as a fashion site for \"plus-sized women.\"\n\nLaunched in May 2010, SportsGrid offers a mix of sports news, video clips and other media tracking both sports and the media world surrounding it. Like the other Abrams Media properties, the site features a Power Grid \"tabulated by using a specially developed algorithm that pools a variety of metrics, including TV ratings; Web traffic and circulation counts; attendance; number of Twitter followers; on-field performance for players and coaches; and franchise values.\" In 2013, SportsGrid was acquired by Anthem Media Group in a stock and cash deal.\n\nIn May 2012, Abrams launched a site focused on the personalities and lifestyles of chefs. Rather than recipes or techniques, The Braiser's topics consist of chefs who \"have gone from being food icons to becoming mainstream celebrities,\" according to an interview Abrams gave to The New York Times in late April. It was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award in 2014. By 2015, The Braiser had gone on \"a short hiatus\" with plans for a relaunch, but saw no further activity as of 2019.\n\nAbrams has published articles in \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\" magazine, \"The American Lawyer\", and the \"Yale Law and Policy Review\". He has also written for online magazines such as \"The Huffington Post\", \"Daily Beast\", and Mediaite.\n\nIn March 2010, Abrams published the book \"Man Down: Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt That Women Are Better Cops, Drivers, Gamblers, Spies, World Leaders, Beer Tasters, Hedge Fund Managers and Just About Everything Else\". The book was #10 on the Washington Post best seller list of July 17, 2011, and has been translated into Russian, Indonesian, Croatian, Swedish and Hebrew, among other languages.\n\nAbrams' second book, \"Lincoln’s Last Trial: The Murder Case That Propelled Him to the Presidency\", tells the true story of Abraham Lincoln's last murder trial. The book was released in June 2018, and spent five weeks in the top ten New York Times Bestseller list, hardcover non-fiction. Mental Floss rated the book #1 on their list \"56 Best Books of 2018.\"\n\nHis book \"Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense: The Courtroom Battle to Save His Legacy\", released on May 21, 2019, is a New York Times bestseller. Theodore Roosevelt accused his former friend and ally, now turned rival, Republican Party leader William Barnes Jr. of political corruption. Barnes responded by suing Roosevelt for an enormous sum that could have financially devastated him.\n\nMost recently, Abrams announced \"John Adams Under Fire: The Founding Father's Fight for Justice in the Boston Massacre Murder Trial\" with an expected publication date of March 3, 2020. In 1770, British soldiers shot and killed five civilians. As John Adams would later remember, “On that night the formation of American independence was born.” Yet when the British soldiers faced trial, the young lawyer Adams was determined that they receive a fair one. He volunteered to represent them, keeping the peace in a powder keg of a colony, and in the process created some of the foundations of what would become United States law.\n\nAbrams has made other on-air appearances covering law, politics, and to promote his books, including on all three late night talk shows. He has appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS and the Tonight Show on NBC.\n\nIn June 2012, Abrams had his first child, a son named Everett Floyd Abrams, with then-girlfriend Florinka Pesenti, who was part of the winning team on \"The Amazing Race 3\".\n\nAbrams was a co-owner (with David Zinczenko) of the restaurant The Lion in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood. The Lion closed in 2015.\n\nAbrams's sister, Ronnie Abrams, was nominated for a federal judgeship by Barack Obama in 2011. She received her commission on March 23, 2012.\n"}

History traces the life-sized statue to Nagasaki, Japan. It was sent floating in the sea by missionaries operating in secret in Japan (for fear of persecution during the Tokugawa Bakufu), along with the Miraculous Statue of the Black Nazarene (Sinait's Santo Cristo Milagroso). It was first found by local fishermen in the shores of Barangay Dadalaquiten of Sinait, Ilocos Sur and Barangay Paguetpet of Badoc (on the present-day boundary between Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur) in the year 1620. Only fishermen from Sinait were able to move the Statue of the Black Nazarene. The fishermen from Badoc, unable to move the Black Nazarene, were able to move the La Virgen Milagrosa that came with it—which was, in turn, unable to be moved by the fishermen from Sinait. They took the statues to their respective towns, hence becoming their patron saints. Today The La Virgen Milagrosa is enshrined at the Badoc Church, as Barangay Paguetpet was renamed in honor of the La Virgen Milagrosa. A chapel was erected near the site where the image landed, which is a stone's throw from the chapel marking the landing site of the Santo Cristo Milagroso.\n\nThe Juan Luna Shrine is the reconstructed two storey ancestral house of the painter Juan Luna, the revolutionary general Antonio Luna, and the violinist Manuel Luna. Built in the typical middle class fashion, the house was burned down in 1861 and was rebuilt using clay bricks and molave wood. Now a museum, the shrine houses photos of the Luna family and reproductions of Luna's paintings. The second floor retains the living room, bedrooms, azotea, and chapel, all furnished with period furniture and accessories.\n\nAlso known as Badoc Church, St. John the Baptist Parish Church was constructed in 1591 and was once a chapel under the jurisdiction of Sinait. It was formally recognized as a parish in 1714 with St. John the Baptist as patron saint. The baroque church made of stone blocks and brick tiles is credited to Reverend Father Valentin Blovide. It was occupied by the Sambals during the revolution headed by Andres Malong in 1660-61.\n\nThe celebrated Philippine painter Juan Luna was baptized in Badoc Church on 27 October 1857. At present, the church houses the miraculous statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary venerated under the title \"Virgin of Miracles\", crowned by Catholic bishops in 1980, and was granted a Canonical coronation by Pope Francis in 31 May 2018.

By the mid-2nd century BC, Rome was trading heavily with the Greek colony of Massilia (modern Marseille) and entered into an alliance with them, by which it agreed to protect the town from local Gauls, including the nearby Aquitani and from sea-borne Carthaginians and other rivals, in exchange for land that it wanted in order to build a road to Hispania, to assist in troop movements to its provinces there. The Mediterranean settlements on the coast continued to be threatened by the powerful Gallic tribes to the north and in 122 BC the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus campaigned in the area and defeated the Allobroges followed by Quintus Fabius Maximus against the Arverni under King Bituitus in 121 BC.\n\nThe area became a Roman province in 121 BC originally under the name Gallia Transalpina (Transalpine Gaul). The name distinguished it from Cisalpine Gaul on the near side of the Alps to Rome.\n\nIn this new province the Romans founded the town of Narbonne in 118 BC. At the same time they built the Via Domitia, the first Roman road in Gaul, connecting Italy to Hispania. They also built the Via Aquitania, which led toward the Atlantic through Tolosa (Toulouse) and Burdigala (Bordeaux). Thus the Romans built a crossroads that made Narbonne an optimal trading centre, and a major trading competitor to Massilia.\n\nIt was from Narbonne that Julius Caesar significantly advanced the task by defeating the Celtic tribes in the Gallic Wars of 58-51 BC. Massilia fell in the Siege of Massilia.\n\nMassilia was allied to Pompey in Caesar's civil war which led to its eventual defeat at the Siege of Massilia in 49 BC after which it lost its territories but was allowed to keep nominal autonomy, due to ancient ties of friendship and support of Rome. \n\nIn 40 BC, during the Second Triumvirate, Lepidus was given responsibility for Gallia Narbonensis (along with Hispania and Africa), while Mark Antony was given the balance of Gaul.\n\nIn 22 BC, imperial administration of Gaul was reorganised establishing the provinces of Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Belgica and Gallia Lugdunensis. Parts of eastern Gaul were incorporated into the provinces Raetia (15 BC) and Germania Superior (AD 83).\n\nCitizenship was granted to all in 212 by the Constitutio Antoniniana.\n\nGenerals Marcus Antonius Primus and Gnaeus Julius Agricola were both born in Gaul, as were emperors Claudius and Caracalla. Emperor Antoninus Pius also came from a Gaulish family.\n\nIn the Crisis of the Third Century around 260, Postumus established a short-lived Gallic Empire, which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the Franks and the Alamanni, invaded Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor Aurelian's victory at Châlons in 274.\n\nIn 286/7 Carausius commander of the Classis Britannica, the fleet of the English Channel, declared himself Emperor of Britain and northern Gaul. His forces comprised his fleet, the three legions stationed in Britain and also a legion he had seized in Gaul, a number of foreign auxiliary units, a levy of Gaulish merchant ships, and barbarian mercenaries attracted by the prospect of booty. In 293 emperor Constantius Chlorus isolated Carausius by besieging the port of Gesoriacum (Boulogne-sur-Mer) and invaded Batavia in the Rhine delta, held by his Frankish allies, and reclaimed Gaul.\n\nA migration of Celts from Britain appeared in the 4th century in Armorica led by the legendary king Conan Meriadoc. They spoke the now extinct British language, which evolved into the Breton, Cornish, and Welsh languages.\n\nThe Goths who had sacked Rome in 410 established a capital in Toulouse and in 418 succeeded in being accepted by Honorius as \"foederati\" and rulers of the Aquitanian province in exchange for their support against the Vandals. \n\nThe Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and Flavius Aëtius had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control. He first used the Huns against the Burgundians, and these mercenaries destroyed Worms, killed king Gunther, and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near Lugdunum in 443. The Huns, united by Attila, became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the Battle of Châlons, in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila.\n\nThe Roman administration finally collapsed as remaining Roman troops withdrew southeast to protect Italy. Between 455 and 476 the Visigoths, the Burgundians, and the Franks assumed control in Gaul. However, certain aspects of the ancient Celtic culture continued after the fall of Roman administration and the Domain of Soissons, a remnant of the Empire, survived from 457 to 486.\n\nIn 486 the Franks defeated the last Roman authority in Gaul at the Battle of Soissons. Almost immediately afterwards, most of Gaul came under the rule of the Merovingians, the first kings of a proto-France.\n\nIn 507, the Visigoths were pushed out of most of Gaul by the Frankish king Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé. They were able to retain Narbonensis and Provence after the timely arrival of an Ostrogoth detachment sent by Theodoric the Great. \n\nCertain Gallo-Roman aristocratic families continued to exert power in episcopal cities (such as the Mauronitus family in Marseilles and Bishop Gregory of Tours). The appearance of Germanic given and family names becomes noticeable in Gallia/Francia from the middle of the 7th century on, most notably in powerful families, indicating that the centre of gravity had definitely shifted.\n\nThe Gallo-Roman (or Vulgar Latin) dialect of the late Roman period evolved into the dialects of the Oïl languages and Old French in the north, and into Occitan in the south.\n\nThe name \"Gallia\" and its equivalents continued in use, at least in writing, until the end of the Merovingian period in the 750s. Slowly, during the ensuing Carolingian period (751-987), the expression \"Francia\", then \"Francia occidentalis\" spread to describe the political reality of the kingdom of the Franks (\"regnum francorum\").\n\nBefore 22 BC Gaul had three geographical divisions, one of which was divided into multiple Roman provinces:\n\nAfter 22 BC the Romans divided Gallia Comata into three provinces, the \"Tres Galliae\" (the 3 Gauls):\n\nThe Romans divided these huge provinces into \"civitates\" corresponding more or less with the pre-Conquest communities or polities sometimes described misleadingly as \"tribes,\" such as the Aedui, Allobroges, Bellovaci, and Sequani (see List of Celtic tribes) but the civitates were too large and in turn were divided into smaller units, \"pagi\", a term that eventually became the modern French word \"pays\". These administrative groupings would be taken over by the Romans in their system of local control, and these \"civitates\" would also be the basis of France's eventual division into ecclesiastical bishoprics and dioceses, which would remain in place—with slight changes—until the French revolution.\n\nIn the five centuries between Caesar's conquest and the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Gaulish language and cultural identity underwent a syncretism with the Roman culture of the new governing class, and evolved into a hybrid Gallo-Roman culture that eventually permeated all levels of society. Gauls continued writing some inscriptions in the Gaulish language, but switched from the Greek alphabet to the Latin alphabet during the Roman period. Current historical research suggests that Roman Gaul was \"Roman\" only in certain (albeit major) social contexts, the prominence of which in material culture has hindered a better historical understanding of the permanence of many Celtic elements. The Roman influence was most apparent in the areas of civic religion and administration. The Druidic religion was suppressed by Emperor Claudius I, and in later centuries Christianity was introduced. The prohibition of Druids and the syncretic nature of the Roman religion led to disappearance of the Celtic religion. It remains to this day poorly understood: current knowledge of the Celtic religion is based on archeology and via literary sources from several isolated areas such as Ireland and Wales.\n\nThe Romans easily imposed their administrative, economic, artistic (especially in terms of monumental art and architecture) and literary culture. They wore the Roman tunic instead of their traditional clothing. \n\nSurviving Celtic influences also infiltrated back into the Roman Imperial culture in the 3rd century. For example, the Gaulish tunic—which gave Emperor Caracalla his surname—had not been replaced by Roman fashion. Similarly, certain Gaulish artisan techniques, such as the barrel (more durable than the Roman amphora) and chain mail were adopted by the Romans.\n\nThe Celtic heritage also continued in the spoken language (see History of French). Gaulish spelling and pronunciation of Latin are apparent in several 5th century poets and transcribers of popular farces. The last pockets of Gaulish speakers appear to have lingered until the 6th or 7th century. Gaulish was held to be attested by a quote from Gregory of Tours written in the second half of the 6th century, which describes how a shrine \"called 'Vasso Galatae' in the Gallic tongue\" was destroyed and burnt to the ground. Throughout the Roman rule over Gaul, although considerable Romanization in terms of material culture occurred, the Gaulish language is held to have survived and continued to be spoken, coexisting with Latin.\n\nGermanic placenames were first attested in border areas settled by Germanic colonizers (with Roman approval). In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Franks settled in northern France and Belgium, the Alemanni in Alsace and Switzerland, and the Burgundians in Savoie.\n\n\n\n"}

When the Spaniards came to the area, the people staged a revolt, captured the priest and mutilated his body. Because of this incident, the Spaniards change the name of Nagparitan, meaning prohibit, to Nagpartian which means the place of slaughter.\n\nIn 1903, Nagpartian was then fused with the Municipality of Bangui because of the unstable condition due to low collection of government taxes. On February 28, 1914, by virtue of a legislative act, Nagpartian was renamed Burgos in honor of one of the three martyred priest, Fr, Jose Burgos. Seńor Juan Ignacio was the first Presidente Municipal of the town.\n\nMajority of people in the municipality are engaged in the production of commercial crops like rice, garlic, tomato, mongo and corn. However, aside from producing agricultural products, most of them also venture into fishing, livestock and swine-raisin, rice milling, and cottage industries like furniture and hollow-blocks making, smelting, salt-making, and mat weaving.\n\nThe town is endowed with scenic and tourist-attracting shores or coastline – from plain white beaches in Barangays.

The legend, as handed down from generation to generation, was classically romantic, a gallant heir - warrior fighting for a lady's love.\n\nIn the early times, there were two prosperous barangays in the present site of the town each one ruled by a powerful chief or datu. They were bitter and mortal enemies. Naslag was the powerful chief of the barangay north of the river while Allawigan was the chief of the south of the river. One day, Allawigan and his warriors went to hunt. Rass, his son, was the bravest among them. During the hunt, Ras followed the deer, which went north across the river. While he was watching the fleeing deer, he saw a beautiful damsel gathering wild flowers on the opposite side of the riverbank. She was Ding, the daughter of Naslag. To help the lady, Ras gathered the most beautiful flowers near him; put them at the head of his arrow and shoot near the lady's feet. Ding looked at the other side of the river and waved her hands. Ras went home happily.\n\nRas begged his father for permission to win Ding for his wife. But because the fathers of Ding and Ras were bitter enemies, the only way he could win her was in the open battle fiercely fought between the two tribes. Ras led his father's warriors. They fought valiant and came out victorious in the end. Ras asked for Ding as a prize but Naslag refused. This angered him and hurled a challenge to the bravest warrior of Naslag in single combat with Ding as prize. The challenge was accepted. The combat was fought, and again, Ras was victorious. He brought Ding triumphantly to Allawigan, his father. Thereafter, the people named the two barangays Dingras, after Ras, their valiant warrior ruler, and Ding, his beautiful wife.\n\nIn the , the population of Dingras was people, with a density of .\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Dingras, Ilocos Norte, Philippines eyed a \"Guinness World Records\" certification after baking a kilometer-long \"\"bibingka\"\" (native cake) made from 1,000 kilos of cassava and eaten by 1,000 residents.\n\n"}

It was one of the first optical formats to utilize a blue laser, which allowed for a higher density of data to be stored on optical media compared to infrared laser technology used in the CD and red laser technology used in the DVD format.\n\nPFD uses a 405 nm wavelength and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.85 for the laser, allowing 23 GB of data to be stored on one 12 cm disc – the equivalent to nearly five single-layer DVDs, and a 1x speed data transfer rate of 88 Mbit/s for reading and 72 Mbit/s for writing. After the 23GB disc was released, a dual-layer 50 GB was developed and released.\n\nThis format is sometimes confused with the Blu-ray Disc format, another optical disc format using blue-violet lasers and supported by Sony. Even the PFD's caddy and Blu-ray's prototype caddy (later dropped) looked very similar. Capabilities differ; single-layer PFD discs have a capacity of 23 GB whereas Blu-ray discs can store 25 GB. However, Blu-ray discs currently allow a 2x data transfer rate of 72 Mbit/s – lower than PFD. This is because PFD discs use much higher quality media and drives use higher quality components, making them prohibitively expensive for the consumer segment to which Blu-ray is aimed. PFD discs can have a capacity of up to 100 GB for rewritable discs, and 128 GB for write-once discs.\n\nThe PFD format is used as the recording medium in Sony's XDCAM professional video devices, both for standard definition and high definition applications.\n\nProfessional Disc for DATA (PDD or ProDATA) was a general-use recording media variant of PFD, aimed primarily at small and medium-sized enterprise for data archival and backup. PDD drives and media became available in mid-2004. The BW-RS101 external SCSI-3 drive originally retailed in the UK at £2,344 (excl. VAT) directly from Sony, and 23 GB write-once and re-writeable media retailed for £30 each. Two other drives – the BW-F101/A internal SCSI drive and the BW-RU101 external USB 2.0 drive also became available around the same time.\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Professional Disc for DATA reached their \"end of life\". PFD are still being manufactured and used in Sony XDCAM devices. Sony states that PDD and PFD media are not compatible, but does not specify the exact differences between products.\n\nSony's PDW-U1 Professional Disc drive is an external drive that connects via USB 2.0 to Windows or Mac OS X computers using the included free software from Sony. In a firmware and software upgrade in late July 2009, Sony added the ability for computer users to store any computer files on the Professional Disc into the dedicated \"User Data\" folder.\n\n\n"}

In the 1920s and 1930s, leading cartoonists were given full pages in the Sunday comics sections, allowing them to add smaller strips and single-panel cartoons to their page.\n\nToppers usually were drawn by the same artist as the larger strip. These strips usually were positioned at the top of the page (hence their name), but they sometimes ran beneath the main strip.\n\nToppers were introduced by King Features Syndicate during the 1920s, enabling newspaper editors to claim more comic strips without adding more pages. The practice allowed newspapers to drop the topper and place an additional strip or an additional advertisement into the Sunday comics section. They also made it possible to reformat a strip from full-page size to tabloid size.\n\nIn 1904, Frederick Opper drew his \"And Her Name Was Maud\", about the kicking mule Maud, into comic strips, books and animation, but on May 23, 1926, Opper positioned \"And Her Name Was Maud\" as the topper to his \"Happy Hooligan\", and it ran along with \"Happy Hooligan\" until both strips came to a conclusion on October 14, 1932. On May 16, 1926, Harold Knerr began \"\", a topper to \"The Katzenjammer Kids\", which ran until two years after his death.

Knerr's strip was reformatted for reprints in \"Magic Comics\" in the early 1940s.\n\nBilly DeBeck's topper for \"Barney Google\" was \"Parlor Bedroom and Sink\", which evolved into \"Parlor Bedroom and Sink Starring Bunky\" and eventually was titled simply \"Bunky\". In the mid-1930s, DeBeck added alongside \"Bunky\" a single-panel topper, \"Knee-Hi-Knoodles\", depictions of kids' funny remarks (contributed by readers). \"Bunky\" spawned the catchphrase, \"Youse is a viper, Fagin.\" A big fan of \"Bunky\" was pulp author Robert E. Howard, who liked to quote from the strip, as noted by his friend Tevis Clyde Smith:\n\nCharacters in toppers sometimes turned up in the main strip, such as Herby appearing in \"Smitty\", and Kitty Higgins joining the cast of \"Moon Mullins\". In a few cases, the topper introduced characters later developed into a successful Sunday page, as happened when \"Krazy Kat\" became a spin-off from \"The Family Upstairs\" and Roy Crane's \"Wash Tubbs\" appeared over J. R. Williams' \"Out Our Way with the Willets\" Sunday strip. The \"Wash Tubbs\" Sunday strip ran in that format from 1927 until 1933, when Crane launched \"Captain Easy\" as a Sunday page (featuring Wash Tubbs as a secondary character).\n\nGene Ahern's topper \"The Squirrel Cage\", which ran above his \"Room and Board\", is notable because of the repetitive use of the nonsensical question, '\"Nov shmoz ka pop?\", which was never translated yet became a national catchphrase. As a consequence, \"The Squirrel Cage\" is today better remembered than \"Room and Board\", despite its 17-year run.\n\nOn at least one occasion, a character exited the topper and dropped down into the main strip. This happened on April 17, 1938, when an absent-minded character in the \"Rosie's Beau\" topper realized he was in the wrong place and climbed down into the first panel of \"Bringing Up Father\", arriving in the living room of Maggie and Jiggs. During the 1940s, \"Snookums\" ran as the topper above \"Bringing Up Father\". In the final episode of HBO's \"The Pacific\" (2010), Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale) is seen reading \"Snookums\".\n\nDuring its long run, \"Pete the Tramp\" had several topper strips, as detailed by comic strip historian Allan Holtz:\n\nIn half-page format comics, toppers at times appeared at the bottom; if removed, the remaining comic fit in a third page. Some toppers consisted of only a single panel, an example being those that accompanied \"Joe Palooka\" in the mid-1940s. Holtz notes:\n\nAnd further:\n\nSome strips continued to supply toppers into the 1960s, and in a few cases even the 1970s. \"Maw Green\" in \"Little Orphan Annie\" was the last Sunday strip topper, except for the brief use of the topper parodies \"Sawdust\" and \"The Invisible Tribe\" in \"Dick Tracy\". Many newspapers in the late 1980s ran Jim Davis' \"U.S. Acres\" alongside Davis' own \"Garfield\" (also the most popular comic at the time). However, both were stand-alone strips and sold separately (also, unlike most toppers, \"U.S. Acres\" also had a daily strip until very late in its run).\n\nSome underground and alternative comic artists have used toppers in their work, though not in the context of a Sunday strip. The strip \"Fat Freddy's Cat\" appeared as a topper in the underground comic book \"The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers\". Tony Millionaire's weekly comic strip \"Maakies\" is perhaps the only contemporary syndicated strip to run a topper (which appears at the bottom of the main strip and lacks a consistent title). Toppers have also been used in some comics by Chris Ware and Daniel Clowes to mimic the format of a Sunday comics page. A variant of the topper, \"throwaway\" panels containing a \"throwaway gag\" (inessential to the thrust of the strip) remain common , and allow different formats depending on available space.\n\n\n"}

At the consistory of 1122, Callixtus named him Cardinal Priest of S. Anastasia. \n\n\"The history of the papacy in the early Middle Ages was marked by constantly contested papal elections wherein the various claimants were often proxies for struggles between factions of the nobility\" \nAt the time of the death of Callixtus on 13 December 1124, the city of Rome was divided between the Frangipani, who supported the German Holy Roman Emperor, and the Pierleoni, who led the Roman nobility. Each faction promoted their own candidate for pope. The conclave was held three days later on 16 December. The Cardinals assembled, under the protection of the Pierleoni, in the chapel of the monastery of S. Pancrazio al Laterano attached to the south of the Lateran basilica. Initially, most of the cardinals held for Cardinal Saxo de Anagni (Sasso), Cardinal-Priest of San Stefano in Celiomonte, who was backed by the Pierleoni family. However, support shifted to Cardinal Boccapecci at the suggestion of Jonathas, the Cardinal-Deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano, a Pierleoni partisan. Boccapecci was then elected, and chose the name Celestine II.\n\nBoccapecci had only just been proclaimed pope, the investment ceremony started and the singing of the \"Te Deum\" begun when, Roberto Frangipani and a body of armed men broke into the church. Leo Frangipani and the papal chancellor Cardinal Aymeric de Bourgogne proclaimed Lamberto Cardinal Scannabecchi (a man of considerable learning) pope. During the ensuing melee, Cardinal Boccapecci was wounded. Since he had not yet been formally consecrated pope, Boccapecci declared himself willing to resign, which he formally did the next day in order to avoid a schism. The Pierleoni were paid a substantial bribe to concede. Cardinal Scannabecchi was unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner, and he too resigned his position before all of the assembled Cardinals, but was immediately and unanimously re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124 under the name Honorius II.\n\nIt is not clear why someone else assumed Boccapecci's titular seat in 1126.\n\nAccording to historian Salvador Miranda, as Boccapecci was duly elected, he should not be considered an antipope; but as he resigned before being consecrated and enthroned, neither is he listed among the popes. \n\n"}

It was founded by Jose Gabriel Garcia and in 1866 as the Professional Institute, replacing the former Universidad Santo Tomás de Aquino, one of the first universities of the Western Hemisphere (Americas), which was founded unofficially by a Papal bull in 1538, officially by royal decree in 1558, and closed in 1822. It was later renamed University of Santo Domingo in 1914.\n\nIn structure, the school followed the model of the University of Alcalá de Henares. The university organized its offerings into four schools: Medicine, Law, Theology, and the Arts. Today, the University has expanded to eight schools: Humanities, the Arts, Law and Political Science, Health Sciences, Economics and Social Sciences, Science, Engineering and Architecture, and Agricultural Sciences.\n\nThe University traces its foundations to a Dominican seminary established in 1538. This was raised to the status of a university by the Papal Bull \"In Apostolatus Culmine\", issued by Pope Paul III on 28 October 1538, and granted the same rights and powers as the Spanish University of Alcalá de Henares. It was initially organised in four faculties, following the pattern of medieval European universities: Theology, Law, Medicine and Arts.\n\nIn 1801, the university was suspended due to the Haitian occupation; it reopened in 1815 after Spanish colonial rule was restored under the rectorship of Dr José Núñez de Cáceres. However, it was forced to close again in 1822 due to the conscription of its students. After the Dominican Republic was established in 1844, an attempt to reopen the university was made by President Pedro Santana in 1859, but this was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1866 the \"Instituto Profesional\" (Professional Institute) was created by Jose Gabriel Garcia and Emiliano Tejera in Santo Domingo, providing higher education in the city. This was closed in 1891 but reopened in 1895. On 16 November 1914, President Ramón Báez (who was also rector of the Institute) raised it to university status under the name \"University of Santo Domingo\". This new university was forced to close by the US occupation from 1916 to 1924. After the start of the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo in 1930, the university was unable to operate independently; it was only on 31 December 1961, after Trujillo's death, that a law was passed restoring its autonomy.\n\nThe Humanities Faculty is formed of the Schools of Social Communication, Philosophy and Anthropology, History, Foreign Language, Literature and Psychology Schools.\nThe authorities for the period 2008–2011 are:\n\nThe Agronomy and Veterinary Sciences Faculty is formed of the Schools of Agronomic Engineering, Zootechnics and Veterinary Science Schools.\n\nThe Law and Political Science Faculty is formed of the Schools of Law and Political Science Schools.\n\nThe Law and Political Science Faculty award the titles of Licentiate in Law and Licentiate in Political Science; the latter has three majors: \"Internationals Studies\", \"Socioeconomics Studies\" and \"Internationals Relationship\". The Criminology Institute is a part of the Faculty.\n\nBy Law 4412 of 24 March 1956 the University Organization Law of 21 October 1937 was modified, adding the Economics and Commerce Faculty to the existing faculties. The new faculty would award the degrees of Licentiate in Commercial Science and Doctor in Economics and Commercial Science.\n\nAt the same time, Law 4413 decreed that the four courses \"of the second cycle of the Superior School of Accountant Technician, established by the decree 2383... were assigned to the Economics and Commerce Faculty of the \"Santo Domingo University\" from 12 October 1956, under the name of Commercial Science Department\".\n\nThe Law 4439 dated 4 May 1956 changed the name of the \"Economics and Commerce Faculty\" to the \"Economics, Finance and Commerce Faculty\". This same law authorized to the graduates of the Superior School of Accountant Technician, with the title of Accountant Technician \"provides them with licence to practice the profession of Authorized Public Accountant and carry the title in Commercial Science and allows them to opt for the Doctorate in Commercial Science by the presentation of a thesis, following the regulation dictated by the University Council\".\n\nIn 1960, Law 5130 changed the \"Economics, Finance and Commerce Faculty\" to the \"Economic Science Faculty\" and included the Public Administration School. The Organic statute approved by the University Cloister in 1966, gave the faculty with its current name of the \"Economics and Social Sciences Faculty\".\n\nCurrently, the Economics and Social Sciences Faculty is formed of the Schools of Economics, Accountant, Statistics, Sociology, Marketing and Administration Schools.\n\nThe authorities for the period 2008–2011 are:\n\nThe Engineering and Architecture Faculty is formed of the Schools of Architecture, Electromechanics Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Surveying and Industrial Engineering Schools.\n\nThe Science Faculty is constituted of the Schools of Biology, Geographic Science, Physics, Mathematics, Microbiology and Parasitology, Chemistry and Computing Schools.\n\nThe Health Sciences Faculty formed of the Schools of Pharmacy, Imaging, Infirmary, Odontology, Bioanalysis, Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Physiology and Morphology Schools.\n\nThe Arts Faculty is formed of the Schools of Criticism and History of Art, Publicity, Theater, Music, Film, Television and Photography, Industrial Design and Fashion and Plastic Arts Schools.\n\nRector: Dr. Ivan Grullóne.\n\nEducational vice-rector: Dr. Jorge Asjanna David.\n\nVice-rector of Research and Postgraduates: Ma.

{"id": "2068052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068052", "title": "TXCN", "text": "TXCN\n\nTexas Cable News (TXCN) was an American regional cable news television channel that was owned by the Gannett Company. The channel operated out of offices in Dallas, Texas, located on Young Street in the city's downtown district.\n\nThe 24-hour channel launched on January 1, 1999, and was founded by its original owner, the Belo Corporation. TXCN combined the news staffs of four television stations in Texas owned by Belo at the time – ABC affiliates WFAA in Dallas and KVUE in Austin (acquired from Gannett shortly after this channel's launch), and CBS affiliates KHOU in Houston and KENS in San Antonio – in addition to \"The Dallas Morning News\" (which was co-owned with TXCN and the four television stations under common ownership until 2008) and the company's Washington, D.C. news bureau. During the first few years on the air, most of the cable operators have aired TXCN on channel 38 as advertised by the channel itself. In addition to rolling news, weather, and sports coverage, TXCN had public affairs, sports-talk, and entertainment news programming. In its early years, the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" has called TXCN \"CNN Headline News with a Texas flavor.\"\n\nWhen necessary, TXCN would also cover breaking news events outside of Texas, especially during the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nOn December 4, 2004, Belo announced the layoffs of 45 of the channel's 75 staffers. This resulted in the programming on Texas Cable News being scaled down on January 1, 2005. Belo attributed the failure of Texas Cable News to a lack of distribution on cable providers in Texas' largest television markets. From that time until closure, TXCN aired repackaged content from the aforementioned stations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. All original programming, with the exception of weather segments and occasional original programming, was dropped along with on-air talent, except for weather department staff. By April 2009, Belo had further consolidated and downsized operations of TXCN, and the channel's dedicated production and technical facilities, until then located in a building behind the Dallas Morning News building, were vacated.\n\nIn 2008, Belo decided to split its broadcasting and newspaper interests into separate companies. TXCN remained with the broadcasting side, which retained the Belo Corporation name, while the newspapers (including \"The Dallas Morning News\") were spun off to the similarly named \"A.H.\" Belo Corporation. However, the former corporate cousins maintained a news partnership. On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo for $2.2 billion, including TXCN and its sister stations. The deal was granted FCC approval on December 20, and was finalized on December 23.\n\nOn March 3, 2015, WFAA's website announced that TXCN was shutting down after 16 years. A meeting between the owner, Gannett Company, and various cable outlets have agreed to shut down the statewide news channel. After the shutdown, only Time Warner Cable News (renamed Spectrum News as of September 20, 2016) in Austin, Waco and San Antonio are the only 24-hour local or regional news channels left in the state of Texas. It was slated to go off the air on April 1, 2015, but the cut-off time was extended to May 1, 2015 at 12:01 a.m. Central time, in which the channel quietly ceased operations after the 11:00 p.m. cycle of the repackaged newscasts. Roger Barry, the last remaining TXCN on-air personality, announced that he was retiring earlier that day. This came at a time when the channel's viewership had decreased in the face of increased news consumption on digital and other non-television platforms, along with the nationwide streaming availability of the newscasts live or delayed of the stations contributing content for the network via their websites, effectively making the entire operation superfluous and duplicative. In addition, the network did not broadcast in HD, which was nearly universal for television news in the U.S. by the time of the shut-down announcement. \n\nIn addition to the network itself, TXCN has maintained a website, which listed headlines and weather reports across the state, sports scores, Texas Lottery results, daily Texas History, programming guide for TXCN's original shows, anchor biographies, and a channel finder. Until April 30, 2015, the webpage remained somewhat active, but many features have gradually shut down since the 2004 staffing cuts, leaving only the news headlines and weather updates from the 4 aforementioned stations via their websites' RSS feeds, and an outdated channel guide (still listed that DFW was being served by Comcast and Houston being served by Time Warner Cable even though the 2 clusters swapped providers in August 2006). On April 30, 2015, the website was changed to a message stating that TXCN would be discontinued on May 1, 2015 at 12:01 a.m. Central time. The message also provided a list of all Texas-area Gannett stations--including the recently acquired London Broadcasting assets (now spun off to TEGNA Media as of June 29, 2015) and their corresponding websites. As of March 2019, TXCN's website shuts down and redirects to WFAA's URL.\n\n"}

{"id": "2068058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068058", "title": "Red heifer", "text": "Red heifer\n\nThe red heifer (; \"para adumma\") (female cow which is never pregnant or milked or yoked), also known as the red cow, was a cow brought to the priests as a sacrifice according to the Torah, and its ashes were used for the ritual purification of \"Tum'at HaMet\" (\"the impurity of the dead\"), that is, an Israelite who had come into contact with a corpse.\n\nThe red heifer ritual is described in the Book of Numbers. The children of Israel were commanded to obtain \"a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke\". The heifer is then ritually slaughtered and burned outside of the camp. Cedar wood, hyssop, and wool or yarn dyed scarlet are added to the fire, and the remaining ashes are placed in a vessel containing pure water.\n\nIn order to purify a person who has become ritually contaminated by contact with a corpse, water from the vessel is sprinkled on him, using a bunch of hyssop, on the third and seventh day of the purification process. The priest who performs the ritual then becomes ritually unclean, and must then wash himself and his clothes in running waters. He is deemed impure until evening.\n\nThe Mishnah, the central compilation of Rabbinic Oral Law, the oral component of the written Torah, contains a tractate on the red heifer, Tractate Parah (\"cow\") in Seder Tohorot, which explains the procedures involved. The tractate has no existing Gemara, although commentary on the procedure appears in the Gemarah for other tractates of the Talmud. \n\nAccording to Mishnah Parah, the presence of two black hairs invalidates a red heifer, in addition to the usual requirements of an unblemished animal for sacrifice. There are various other requirements, such as natural birth (Caesarian section renders a Heifer candidate invalid). The water must be \"living\" i.e. spring water. This is a stronger requirement than for a ritual bath. Rainwater accumulated in a cistern is permitted for a mikveh but cannot be used in the red heifer ceremony.\n\nThe Mishnah reports that in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, water for the ritual came from the Pool of Siloam. The ceremony involved was complex and detailed. To ensure complete ritual purity of those involved, care was taken to ensure that no one involved in the red heifer ceremony could have had any contact with the dead or any form of tumah, and implements were made of materials such as stone, which in Jewish law do not act as carriers for ritual impurities. The Mishnah recounts that children were used to draw and carry the water for the ceremony, children born and reared in isolation for the specific purpose of ensuring that they never came into contact with a corpse:\n\nVarious other devices were used, including a causeway from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives so that the heifer and accompanying priests would not come into contact with a grave.\n\nAccording to the Mishnah, the ceremony of the burning of the red heifer took place on the Mount of Olives. A ritually pure kohen slaughtered the heifer and sprinkled its blood in the direction of the Temple seven times. The red heifer was then burned on a pyre, together with crimson dyed wool, hyssop, and cedar wood. In recent years, the site of the burning of the red heifer on the Mount of Olives has been tentatively located by archaeologist Yonatan Adler.\n\nThe heifer's color is described in the Torah as \"adumah\" (), normally translated as \"red\". However, Saadiah Gaon translates this word to Judeo-Arabic as (\"safra\"), a word translated to English as \"yellow\". In addition, the Quran describes Moses being commanded about a \"yellow\" cow (Surat al-Baqara 9.69).\n\nTo explain this discrepancy, Yosef Qafih (in his Hebrew translation and commentary on Saadiah's work) argues that the Bible requires the cow to have a ruddy light-brown color, which he says is the normal color of a cow. He says this color is in general described as in Hebrew and \"yellow\" in Arabic, resolving the discrepancy in the color words. He explains the Biblical requirement to mean that the cow be entirely of this color, and not have blotches or blemishes of a different color.\n\nThe existence of a red heifer that conforms with all of the rigid requirements imposed by halakha is a biological anomaly. The animal must be entirely of one color, and there is a series of tests listed by the rabbis to ensure this; for instance, the hair of the cow must be absolutely straight (to ensure that the cow had not previously been yoked, as this is a disqualifier). According to Jewish tradition, only nine red heifers were actually slaughtered in the period extending from Moses to the destruction of the Second Temple. Mishnah Parah recounts them, stating that Moses prepared the first, Ezra the second, Simon the Just and Yochanan the High Priest prepared two each, and Elioenai ben HaQayaph, Hanameel the Egyptian, and Yishmael ben Pi'avi prepared one each.\n\nThe extreme rarity of the animal, combined with the detailed ritual in which it is used, have given the red heifer special status in Jewish tradition. It is cited as the prime example of a \"ḥok\", or biblical law for which there is no apparent logic. Because the state of ritual purity obtained through the ashes of a red heifer is a necessary prerequisite for participating in Temple service, efforts have been made in modern times by Jews wishing for biblical ritual purity (see tumah and taharah) and in anticipation of the building of the Third Temple to locate a red heifer and recreate the ritual. However, multiple candidates have been disqualified.\n\nThe Temple Institute, an organization dedicated to preparing the reconstruction of a Third Temple in Jerusalem, has been attempting to identify red heifer candidates consistent with the requirements of Numbers 19:1–22 and Mishnah Tractate Parah. In recent years, the institute thought to have identified two candidates, one in 1997 and another in 2002. The Temple Institute had initially declared both kosher but later found each to be unsuitable. The Institute has been raising funds in order to use modern technology to produce a red heifer that is genetically based on the Red Angus. In September 2018, the institute announced a red heifer candidate was born saying \"the heifer is currently a viable candidate and will be examined [to see] whether it possess[es] the necessary qualifications for the red heifer.\"\n\nThe second and the longest sura (chapter) in the Quran is named \"\"al-Baqara\"\" ( \"the cow\" or \"the heifer\") after the heifer as the commandment is related in the sura. \n\nIbn Kathir explains that according to Ibn Abbas and Ubaydah, it displayed the stubbornness of the Children of Israel, who asked unnecessary questions to the prophets without readily following any commandment from God; had they slaughtered a cow, any cow, it would have been sufficient for them but instead as they made the matter more difficult, God made it even more difficult for them.\n\nThe non-canonical Epistle of Barnabas (8:1) explicitly equates the red heifer with Jesus. In the New Testament, the phrases \"without the gate\" () and \"without the camp\" (, ) have been taken to be not only an identification of Jesus with the red heifer, but an indication as to the location of the crucifixion.\n\nSome believe that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ cannot occur until the Third Temple is constructed in Jerusalem, which requires the appearance of a red heifer born in Israel. Clyde Lott, a cattle breeder, is attempting to systematically breed red heifers and export them to Israel to establish a breeding line of red heifers in Israel in the hope that this will bring about the construction of the Third Temple and ultimately the Second Coming of Jesus.\n\nThe red heifer was also considered sacred to the Greek god Apollo. They are featured in many myths, including that of the creation of the lyre. In it Hermes steals Apollo's red heifers and then hides them. To escape Apollo's rage, Hermes creates the lyre.\n\nGeryon, the mythical three-bodied creature slain by Heracles, had red cattle, according to Pseudo-Apollodorus, which Heracles stole as his tenth labor.\n\nThe red heifer is the official mascot of Gann Academy, a Jewish high school located in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\n"}

{"id": "2068074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068074", "title": "Swiss literature", "text": "Swiss literature\n\nAs there is no dominant national language, the four main languages of French, Italian, German and Romansch form the four branches which make up a literature of Switzerland. The original Swiss Confederation, from its foundation in 1291 up to 1798, gained only a few French-speaking districts in what is now the Canton of Fribourg, and so the German language dominated. During that period the Swiss vernacular literature was in German, although in the 18th century, French became fashionable in Bern and elsewhere. At that time, Geneva and Lausanne were not yet Swiss: Geneva was an ally and Vaud a subject land. The French branch does not really begin to qualify as Swiss writing until after 1815, when the French-speaking regions gained full status as Swiss cantons. The Italian and Romansch-Ladin branches are less prominent.\n\nLike the earlier charters of liberties, the original League of 1291 was drawn up in Latin. Later alliances among the cantons, as well as documents concerning the whole Confederation—the Parsons Ordinance of 1370, the Sempach Ordinance of 1393, the Compact of Stans (1481) and all the Recesses of the Diets—were compiled in German. Political documents are not necessarily literature, but these pre-Reformation alliances rested on popular consent, and were expressed in vernacular German rather than in clerkly Latin.\n\nFirst in order of date are the Minnesingers, the number of whom in the districts that ultimately formed part of the medieval Swiss Confederation are said to have exceeded thirty. Zürich then (as now) was the chief literary centre of the Confederation. The two Manesses (father and son) collected many of their songs in a manuscript that has happily come down to us and is preserved in Paris. The most prominent was Master John Hadlaub, who flourished in the second half of the 13th and the first quarter of the 14th centuries. Next we have a long series of war songs, celebrating the victories of the Swiss. One of the earliest and most famous of these was composed by Hans Halbsuter of Lucerne to commemorate the battle of Sempach (1386), not far from his native town. There are other similar songs for the victory of Näfels (1388) and those of the battle of Grandson and battle of Morat (both 1476) in the Burgundian War. In the 14th century the Dominican friar Ulrich Boner of Bern versified many old fables.\n\nMore important are the historical chronicles. In the 14th century we have Christian Kuchlmaster's continuation of the annals of the famous monastery of St Gall, in the early 15th century the rhymed chronicle of the war between the Appenzellers and the abbot of St Gall, and rather later in the same century the chronicles of Conrad Justinger of Bern and Hans Fründ (died 1469) of Lucerne, besides the fantastical chronicle of Strattligen and a scarcely less fanciful poem on the supposed Scandinavian descent of the men of Schwyz and of Ober Hasle, both by Elogius Kiburger (died 1506) of Berne.\n\nIn the 15th century, too, we have the \"White Book of Sarnen\" and the first William Tell song, which gave rise to the well-known legend, as well as the rather later play named the \"Urnerspiel\" dealing with the same subject. The Burgundian War witnessed a great outburst of historical ardour in the shape of chronicles written by Diebold Schilling (died 1486) of Bern, by Melchior Russ (died 1499), Diebold Schilling the Younger (d. between 1516 and 1523) and Petermann Etterlin (died 1509), all three of Lucerne as well as by Gerold Edlibach (died 1530) of Zürich, and by Johnanes Lenz (died 1541) of Brugg. In the vernacular, too, are the earliest descriptions of the Confederation, those by Albert von Bonstetten of Einsiedeln (1479) and by Conrad Turst of Zürich (1496), to whom also we owe the first map of the country (1495–1497).\nThe Swiss humanists wrote in Latin, as did also the Swiss Reformers, at any rate for the most part, though the Zürich Bible of 1531 is an exception. Nicholas Manuel (1484–1530), a many-sided Bernese, composed satirical poems in German against the pope, while Valerius Anshelm (died 1540), also of Bern, wrote one of the best Swiss chronicles. Aegidius Tschudi of Glarus, despite great literary activity, published but a single German work in his lifetime, the \"Uralt warhafflig Alpisch Rhaetia sam pt dem Tract der anderen Alpgebirgen\" (1538) besides his map of Switzerland (same date). Sebastian Munster, who was a Swiss by adoption, published (1544) his \"Cosmographia\" in German, the work being translated into Latin in 1550. But the many-sided Conrad Gesner, a born Swiss, wrote all his works in Latin, German translations appearing only at a later date.\n\nThe first important original product in German was the remarkable and elaborate history and description of Switzerland, issued in 1548 at Zürich by Johannes Stumpf of that town. But Josias Simler, who was in a way his continuator, wrote all his works, theological and geographical, in Latin. Matthew Merian engraved many plates, which were issued in a series of volumes (1642–1688) under the general title of \"Topographia\", the earliest volume describing Switzerland, while all had a text in German by an Austrian, Martin Zeiller. Very characteristic of the age are the autobiography of the Valais scholar Thomas Platter (1499–1582) and the diary of his still more distinguished son Felix (1536–1614), both written in German, though not published till long after.\n\nGradually Swiss historical writers gave up the use of Latin for their native tongue, so Michael Stettler (1580–1642) of Bern, Franz Haffner (1609–1671) of Soleure, and quite a number of Grisons authors (though the earliest in date, Ulrich Campell of Süs, \"c.\" 1509–\"c.\" 1582, still clung to Latin), such as Bartholomäus Anhorn (1566–1640) and his son of the same name (1616–1670) and Johannes Guler von Wyneck (1562–1637). Fortunat Sprecher (1585–1647) preferred to write his \"Pallas raetica\" in Latin, as did Fortunat von Juvalta (1567–1654?) in the case of his autobiography. The autobiography of Hans Ardser of Davos (1557-post 1614) and the amusing dialogue between the Niesen and the Stockhorn by Hans Rudolf Rebmann (1566–1605) are both in German. Jean-Baptiste Plantin (1625–1697) wrote his description of Switzerland in Latin, \"Helvetia nova et antiqua\" (1656), but Johann Jacob Wagner's (1641–1695) guide to Switzerland is in German, despite its titles \"Inder memorabilium Helvetiae\" (1684) and \"Mercurius Helveticus\" (1688), though he issued his scientific description of his native land in Latin, \"Historia naturalis Helvetiae curiosa\" (1680).\n\nIn the 18th century the intellectual movement in Switzerland greatly developed, though it was naturally strongly influenced by local characteristics. Basel, Bern and especially Zürich were the chief literary centres. Basel was particularly distinguished for its mathematicians, such as Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), and three members of the Bernoulli family refugees from Antwerp, the brothers Jakob (1654–1705) and Johann (1667–1748), and the latter's son Daniel (1700–1782). But its chief literary glory was Isaac Iselin (1728–1783), one of the founders of the Helvetic Society (1760) and of the Economical Society (1777), and author of a treatise on the philosophy of history entitled \"Geschichte dee Menschheit\" (1764), and of another on ideal politics, \"Philosophische und patriotische Trume eines Menschenfreundes\" (1755), while many of his economical tracts appeared (1776–1782) under the general title of \"Ephemeriden der Menschheit\". At Bern Albrecht von Haller, though especially distinguished as a scientific writer, yet by his poem \"Die Alpen\" (1732) and his travels in his native country did much to excite and stimulate the love of mountain scenery. Another Bernese, Charles Victor de Bonstetten, is a type of the gallicized Liberal Bernese patrician, while Beat Ludwig von Muralt (1665–1749) analysed the racial characteristics of other nations for the instruction of his fellow-countrymen, his Lettres sur les anglais et les francais (1725) being his principal work. Samuel Wyttenbach (1748–1830) devoted himself to making known the beauties of his country to its natives, travelling much and writing much about his travels. Gottlieb Sigmund Gruner wrote the \"Eisgebirge des Schweizerlandes\" (1760), a work describing the ice-clad mountains of Switzerland, though it is rather a useftil compilation than an original contribution to knowledge, but a decided advance on his fellow Bernese, Johann Georg Altmanns (1697–1758) \"Versuch einer historischen und physischen Beschreibung dee helvetischen Eisgebirge\" (1751). In another department of knowledge a son of Albrecht von Haller, Gottlieb Emmantiel von Haller (1735–1786), compiled a most useful bibliography of writings relating to Swiss history, the \"Bibliothek dee Schweizergeschichte\" (6 vols, 1784–1787), that is still indispensable to the historical student.\nBut in the 18th century Zürich was undoubtedly the intellectual and literary capital of German-speaking Switzerland, and gained the title of Athens on the Limmat. One of its earliest and most famous celebrities was JJ Scheuchzer, who travelled much in Switzerland, and wrote much (his travels are described in Latin) as to its natural curiosities, being himself an FRS, and closely associated with Newton and the other English scientific men of the day. But in the purely literary domain the names of JJ Bodmer and of his friend Johann Jakob Breitinger (1701–1776), are the most prominent. By their united exertions the antiquated traditions of German literature were broken down to a large extent, while great praise was bestowed on English poets, Shakespeare, Milton and others. Their views were violently opposed by Gottsched, the leader of the Saxon school, and the controversy that arose forms part of the history of German literature. In 1721–1723 they published jointly the \"Discourse der Mater\", a periodical which spread their views, while more elaborate and systematic expositions of their critical doctrine as to poetry are Bodmer's \"Kritische Abhandlung von dem Wunderbaren in der Poesie\" (1740), and Breitinger's \"Critische Dichtkunst\" (also in 1740). Their untiring efforts helped to prepare the way for the later outburst of German literature begun by Klopstock, Wieland and Lessing. Another famous Zürich writer was Solomon Gesner, the pastoral poet, and yet another was JK Lavater, now best remembered as a supporter of the view that the face presents a perfect indication of character and that physiognomy may therefore he treated as a science. Other well-known Zürich names are those of JH Pestalozzi (1746–1827), the educationalist, of Johann Caspar Hirzel (1725–1803), another of the founders of the Helvetic Society, and author of \"Die Wirthschaft eines philosophischen Bauers\" (1761), and of Johann Georg Sulzer (1720–1779), whose chief work is one on the laws of art or aesthetics, entitled \"Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Kunste\" (1771–1774).\n\nOutside the three towns named above there were several writers of German-speaking Switzerland who must be mentioned. One of the best known even now is Johann Georg Zimmermann (1728–1795), whose \"Betrachtungen fiber die Einsamkeit\" (1756-1784/1785) profoundly impressed his contemporaries. He, like the fabulist AE Erhlich, was born at Brugg. Johannes von Müller of Schaffhausen, was the first who attempted to write (1780) a detailed history of Switzerland, which, though inspired rather by his love of freedom than by any deep research, was very characteristic of his times. JG Ebel was a Swiss by adoption only, but deserves mention as the author of the first detailed guidebook to the country (1793), which held its ground till the days of Murray and Baedeker. A later writer, Heinrich Zschokke (1771–1848), also a Swiss by adoption only, produced (1822) a history of Switzerland written for the people, which had a great vogue.\n\nIn the later literary history of German-speaking Switzerland three names stand out above all others: Albert Bitzius, known as Jeremias Gotthelf from the first of his numerous tales of peasant life in the Emmenthal, Gottfried Keller, perhaps the most genuinely Swiss poet and novelist of the century, and Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, also a poet and novelist, but of more cosmopolitan leanings and tastes. Jakob Burckhardt was a famous writer on Italian art, while Jakob Frey (1824–1875) continued the work of Bitzius by his tales of Swiss peasant life. Ulrich Hegner (1759–1840) of Winterthur wrote novels full of local colour, as is also the case with David Hess (painter) (1770–1843) in his description of a cure at Baden in Aargau and various tales. Johann Martin Usteri (1763–1827) of Zürich was one of the earliest to write poems in his native dialect.\n\nLater we have a number of Zürich poets or versifiers, some of whose writings have become very well known. Such were Heinrich Leuthold (1827–1879), August Corrodi (1826–1885) and Leonhard Widmer (1808–1868), the author of \"Trittst im Morgenrot daher\" (1842) (which, set to music by the Cistercian monk Alberic Zwyssig (1808–1854), is now known as the Swiss Psalm), of \"Es lebt in jeder Schweizerbrust\" (1842), and \"Wo Berge sich erheben\" (1844). To the Bernese poet, Johann Rudolf Wyss (1782–1830), whose father, Johann David Wyss (1743–1818), was the author of the \"Swiss Family Robinson\", we owe the Swiss national anthem, \"Rufst du mein Vaterland?\" and the song, \"Herz, mys Herz, warum so trurig?\"—while Johann Georg Krauer (1792–1845), of Lucerne, wrote the Rütlilied, \"Von ferne sei herzlich gegrüßet\", and Gottfried Keller himself was responsible for \"O mein Heimatland\". Gottlieb Jakob Kuhn (1775–1845) wrote many poems in the Bernese dialect about the Alps and their inhabitants. Less national in sentiment and more metaphysical are the lyrics of Dranmor, the pen-name of the Bernese Ferdinand Schmid (1823–1888).\n\nAmong the chief Swiss writers in the department of belles-lettres, novelists, poets, etc., may be mentioned Ernst Zahn, Meinrad Lienert, Arnold Ott, Carl Spitteler, Fritz Marti, Walther Siegfried, Adolf Frey, Hermann Hesse, Jakob Christoph Heer, Joseph Victor Widmann, and Gottfried Strasser.\n\nIsabella Kaiser wrote poems and stories. Johanna Spyri is famous for her children's stories including \"Heidi\", a fictional character living in the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Carl Spitteler (1919) and Hermann Hesse (1946). Robert Walser was only decades after his death in 1956 recognized as one of the great modern Swiss novelists at the beginning of the twentieth century. Likewise, the revival of the works of travel writer and novelist Annemarie Schwarzenbach had to wait almost 50 years after her premature death in 1942. Friedrich Dürrenmatt was a playwright, author of philosophical crime novels and novellas. Max Frisch was also a playwright, but was famous for being considered the greatest Swiss novelist since Walser. Adolf Muschg is an important essayist, Peter Bichsel and Urs Widmer write stories. Other important Swiss writers are Otto F. Walter and his sister Silja Walter.\n\nOthers worth mentioning are Melinda Nadj Abonji, Sibylle Berg, Erika Burkart, Jürg Federspiel, Lukas Hartmann, Thomas Hürlimann, Franz Hohler, Zoë Jenny, Jürg Laederach, Hugo Loetscher, Kurt Marti, Niklaus Meienberg, Gerhard Meier, Milena Moser, Adolf Muschg, Paul Nizon, Erica Pedretti, Martin Suter, Peter Weber, and Markus Werner. Writers after 1990 are Peter Stamm, Lukas Bärfuss, Christian Kracht and Alex Capus.\n\nImportant Swiss historians include:\n\n\nAlso: A. Bahl, J. L. Brandstetter, W. Burckhardt, K. Dandliker, R. Durrer, H. Escher, A. Heusler, R. Hoppeler, T. von Liebenau, W. Merz, G Meyer von Knonau, W. F. von Münen, W. Oechsli, J. R. Rahn, L. R. von Salis, P. Schweizer, J. Schollenberger, J. Strickler, R. Thommen, and H. Wartmann.\n\nThe knight Othon of Grandson is the earliest figure in the literature of the Suisse \"romande\". He was killed in a judicial duel in 1397, the last scion of his ancient house, and left some amatory poems behind him, while one is extant only in a translation by Chaucer, who makes flattering mention of him. In the 15th and 16th centuries many miracle plays in the local Romance dialect were known. The \"Chronique des chanoines de Neuchâtel\" was formerly supposed to date from the 15th century, but is now considered by many to be a forgery. More individual and characteristic are the romance about Charlemagne, entitled \"Fierabras le Giant\" (1478), by Jean Bagnyon, and the poem named \"Congé pris du siècle siculier\" (1480), by Jacques de Bugnin. But the first really prominent personage in this department of literature is François Bonivard (died 1570) who wrote the \"Chroniques de Geuve\" that extend down to 1530 and were continued to 1562 by Michel Roset (died 1613). The first Protestant French translation of the Bible was issued at Neuchâtel in 1535, its principal authors being Pierre Robert Olivétan and Pierre de Vingle. As a sort of pendant to the Protestant Bonivard, we have the nun Jeanne de Jussie who in her \"Levain du Calvinisme\" (c. 1545) recounts the establishment of Calvinism at Geneva, while the noble Pierre de Pierrefleur in his \"Mémoires\" does the same in a lighter and less lachrymose style for Orbe, his native district. Naturally the Reformers of the Suisse Romande used French much in their theological and polemical works. Of more general interest are the writings of two Frenchmen who were driven by religious persecutions to end their lives at Geneva—the memoirs and poems of Theodore Agrippa d'Aubigné (1552–1630), and the historical writings and poems of Simon Goulart (1543–1628). The great deliverance of Geneva from the duke of Savoy, known as the Escalade (1602), was described in prose by David Piaget (1580–1644) in his \"Histoire de l'escalade\" and celebrated in verse by Samuel Chappuzeau (1625–1701)--in his \"Genève délivrée\", though the narratives of Goulart and that (published officially by the government) attributed to Jean Sarasin (1574–1632), the author of the \"Citadin de Genève\" (1606), are more laconic and more striking. JB Plantin (1625–1697), of Vaud, wrote his topography of Switzerland, \"Helvetia antiqua et nova\" (1656), in Latin, but his \"Abrégé de l'histoire générale de la Suisse\" (1666) in French, while Georges de Montmollin (1628–1703) of Neuchâtel wrote, besides various works as to local history, \"Mémoires\" of his times which have a certain historical value.\nBut the 17th century in the Suisse Romande pales before the glories of the 18th century, which forms its golden age, and was, in a large degree due to the influence of French refugees who, with their families, flocked thither after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) and settled down there for the rest of their lives. Such was Louis Bourguet (1678–1743), who, besides his geological works, founded two periodicals which in different ways did much to stimulate the intellectual life of the Suisse Romande; these were the \"Bibliothèque italique\" (1729–1734), which aimed at making more widely known the results of Italian research, and the \"Mercure suisse\" which, first issued in 1732, lasted till 1784, under different names (rom 1738 onwards the literary section bore the name of \"Journée helvetique\"), and secured contributions from most of the leading writers of the Suisse Romande of the day, such as Firmin Abauzit (1679–1767), Abraham Ruchat (1678–1750), and others. Ruchat is now best remembered as the author (under the pen-name of Gottlieb Kypseler) of an excellent guide-book to Switzerland, the \"Deuces de la Suisse\", which first appeared in 1714 and passed through many editions, the latest being issued in 1778; but his \"Histoire de la Reformation de la Suisse\" (1727–1728) was much esteemed in his day. Another Vaudois historian and antiquary was Charles Guillaume Loys de Bochat (1695–1754) whose \"Mémoires critiques sur divers points de l'ancienne histoire de la Suisse\" (1747–1749) still form a treasure-house for archaeologists. Yet a third Lausanne man was JP de Crousaz (1663–1750), who introduced there the philosophy of Descartes, and was, by his books, the master of Gibbon in logic. A French refugee at Lausanne, Jean Barbeyrac (1674–1744), published in 1712 the \"Droit de la nature et des gens\", a translation of Puffendorf's treatise, with a striking preface of his own. A precursor of Montesquieu and of Rousseau was Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694–1750) in his \"Principes du droit naturel et politique\" (1747 and 1751, issued together in 1763), while the celebrated international lawyer, Emeric de Vattel (1714–1767), was a native of Neuchâtel by birth and descent, and, though he spent most of his life at foreign courts, died at Neuchâtel, not so very long after the publication of his famous \"Droit des gens\" (1758).\nThe year 1754 is a great date in the literary history of the Suisse Romande, for in that year Rousseau came back for good to Geneva, and Voltaire established himself at Ferney, while in 1753 Gibbon had begun his first residence (which lasted till 1758) in Lausanne. The earlier writers mentioned above had then nearly all disappeared, and a more brilliant set took their place. But Rousseau, though a Genevese, belongs rather to European than to Swiss literature, as do later Jacques Necker and his daughter, Madame de Staël, Benjamin Constant and Sismondi. Madame de Charrière (1740–1805) was Dutch by birth, but married to a native of Neuchâtel. Among her earlier works were two novels, \"Le mari sentimental\" (1783), and the \"Lettres de Mistriss Henley publiées par son ami\" (1784), both of which had a great vogue in their day and paint, from her own experience, the sad results of an unsuitable marriage. More celebrated by reason of the liveliness and acuteness with which the manners of a little provincial town are described are her \"Lettres de Lausanne\" (1871), and her \"Lettres neuchâteloises\" (1784), particularly the second part of a story of the former, entitled \"Caliste\", and published in 1788, for, according to Sainte-Beuve, it was a sort of foreshadowing of the more famous \"Coninne\" (1807) of Madame de Staël.\nPH Mallet, a Genevese, who held a chair at Copenhagen, devoted himself to making known to the educated world the history and antiquities of Scandinavia. But more characteristic of Geneva were the efforts of a group of men to spread the cause of natural science by personal investigations in the higher Alps, then but little known. Possibly their interest in such matters had been stimulated by the scientific and psychological speculations of Charles Bonnet. The chief of this school was HB de Saussure one of the founders of geology and meteorology, while his Alpine ascents (undertaken in the cause of science) opened a new world even to non-scientific travellers. The brothers De Luc devoted themselves mainly to questions of physics in the Alps, while Sénebier, the biographer of Saussure, was more known as a physiologist than as a physicist, though he wrote on many branches of natural science, which in those days was not yet highly specialized. On the other hand, Marc Théodore Bourrit, the contemporary of these three men, was rather a curious and inquisitive traveller than a scientific investigator, and charms us even now by his genial simplicity as contrasted with the austerity and gravity of the three writers we have mentioned. Philippe Cyriaque Bridel (1757–1845), best known as the doyen Bridel, was the earliest of the Vaudois poets by virtue of his \"Poèsies helvètiennes\" (1782). But he is better known as the painter of the scenery and people among whom he worked as pastor at Basel, at Château d'Oex, and at Montreux successively. His \"Course de Bâle à Bienne par les vallées du Jura\" appeared in 1802, while descriptions of his travels, as well as of the manners of the natives, local history, and in short everything that could stimulate national sentiment, were issued in a series of periodicals from 1783 to 1831 under the successive titles of \"Etrennes helvétiennes\" and of \"Conservateur suisse\". His patriotic aim met with great success, while his impressions of his mountain wanderings are fresh and unspoilt by any straining after effect. He was the first writer of the Suisse Romande to undertake such wanderings, so that, with obvious differences, he may be regarded not merely as the forerunner, but as the inspirer and model of later Vaudois travellers and climbers in the Alps, such as Rodolphe Töpffer, of Eugène Rambert, and of the last-named's most brilliant pupil, Émile Javelle (1844–1883), whose articles were collected in 1886 by the pious care of his friends under the title of \"Souvenirs d'un alpiniste\".\nAs a poet Juste Olivier surpassed Bridel. Nor can we wonder that with the advance of knowledge Bridel's history is found to be more picturesque than scientific. Two Vaudois, Charles Monnard (1790–1865) and Louis Vulliemin (1797–1879) carried out their great scheme of translating (1837–1840) J. von Müller's Swiss history with its continuation by Hottinger, and then completed it (1841–1851) down to 1815. This gigantic task did not, however, hinder the two friends from making many solid contributions to Swiss historical learning. Later in date were Alexandre Daguet (1816–1894) who wrote an excellent history of Switzerland, while Jean Joseph Hisely (1800–1866), Albert Rilliet (1809–1883), and Pierre Vaucher (1833–1898), all devoted much labour to studying the many problems offered by the early authentic history (from 1291 onwards) of the Swiss Confederation. A different type of history is the work of an honest but partisan writer, the Genevese Jules Henri Merle d'Aubign (1794–1872), entitled \"Histoire de la reformation au temps de Calvin\" (1835–1878). The Vaudois noble Frédéric Gingins-la-Sarra (1790–1863) represents yet another type of historian, devoting himself mainly to the medieval history of Vaud, but occasionally going beyond the numberless authentic documents brought to light by him, and trying to make them prove more than they can fairly be expected to tell us. Jean Antoine Petit-Senn (1792–1870) was a thorough Genevese and a biting satirist, a pensive poet, the Genevese La Bruyère, as he liked to be called, yet was not fully appreciated until after his death, when his widely scattered writings were brought together. Alexandre Vinet, the theologian, and HF Amiel, the philosopher, in a fashion balance each other, and need only be mentioned here. Jean Jacques Porchat (1800–1864) was one of the most prominent among the minor poets of the region, very French owing to his long residence in Paris, and best remembered probably by his fables, first published in 1837 under the title of \"Glanures d'Esope\" (reissued in 1854 as \"Fables et paraboles\"), though in his day his stories for the young were much appreciated. Urbain Olivier (1810–1888), a younger brother of the poet, wrote many tales of rural life in Vaud, while the Genevese novelist Victor Cherbuliez (1829–1899) was perhaps the most brilliant of a brilliant family. Fribourg has produced the local novelist Pierre Sciobret (1833–1876) and the Bohemian poet Etienne Eggis (1830–1867), and Neuchâtel Auguste Bachelin (1830–1890) whose best novel was Jean Louis, a tale of which the scene is laid in the old-fashioned little village of St Blaise. Another Neuchâtel writer, Alice de Chambrier, the poet, died young, as did the Genevese poet Louis Duchosal, both showing in their short lives more promise than performance. Madame de Gasparins (1813–1894) best tale is \"Horizons prochains\" (1857), a very vivid story of rural life in the Vaudois Jura, remarkable for the virile imagination of its descriptions.\n\nEdouard Rod the novelist, and Marc Monnier, critic, poet, dramatist and novelist, are the most prominent figures in the recent literature of the Suisse Romande. Amongst lesser stars we may mention in the department of belles-lettres (novelists, poets or critics) Charles Du Bois-Melly, T. Combe (the pen name of Mlle Adele Huguenin), Samuel Cornut, Louis Favre, Philippe Godet, Oscar Huguenin, Philippe Monnier, Nolle Roger, Virgile Rossel, Paul Seippel and Gaspard Vallette. The chief literary organ of the Suisse Romande is the \"Bibliothèque universelle\", which in 1816 took that title in lieu of \"Bibliothèque Britannique\" (founded in 1796), and in 1861 added that of Revue suisse, which it then absorbed. Amongst historians the first place is due to one of the most learned men whom Switzerland has ever produced, and whose services to the history of the Valais were very great, and abbé Jean Gremaud (1823–1897) of Fribourg. The principal contemporary historians are Victor van Berchem, Francis de Crue, Camille Favre, Henri Fazy, B. de Mandrot, Berthold van Muyden and Edouard Rott.\n\nMore recent authors include Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (1878–1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment, the poets Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric Sauser, 1887–1961), Léon Savary (1895–1968), Gustave Roud (1897–1976), Jean-Georges Lossier (1911–2004), Pericle Patocchi (1911–1968), Maurice Chappaz (1916–2009) and Philippe Jaccottet (born 1925), Armel Guerne (1911–1980) and the novelists Catherine Colomb (1892–1965), Monique Saint-Hélier (1895–1955), Alice Rivaz (1901–1998), Prix Renaudot winner Georges Borgeaud (1914–1998), Yvette Z'Graggen (1920–2012) and Prix Goncourt winner Jacques Chessex (1934–2009). Grisélidis Réal (1929–2005) is in a category of her own.\n\nItalian Switzerland is best known by its artists, while its literature is naturally subject to strong Italian influences, and not to any of a strictly Swiss nature. Stefano Franscini (1796–1857) did much for his native land, especially in educational matters, while his chief published work (1835) was one that gave a general account of the canton. But this is not so thorough and good as a later book by Luigi Lavizzari (1814–1875), entitled \"Escursioni net cantone Ticino\" (1861), which is very complete from all points of view.\n\nAngelo Barotho (died 1893) and Emilio Motta represent the historical sciences, the latter contributing much to the \"Bollettino della Svizzera Italiana\" (from 1879 onwards), which, though mainly historical, devotes much space to literary and historical matters relating to the canton. The art of novel writing does not flourish in Ticino. But it has produced a great number of poets such as Pietro Pen (1794–1869), who translated the Swiss national anthem into Italian, JB Buzzi (1825–1898), Giovanni Airoldi (died before 1900) and Carlo Cioccari (1829–1891), the two former were lyric poets, and the third a dramatist. Two \"younger\" singers are Francesco Chiesa (1871–1973) and M. A. Nessi.\n\nContemporary poets are Giorgio Orelli (1921-2013) and his cousin Giovanni Orelli (1928-2016), Alberto Nessi (born 1940) and Fabio Pusterla (born 1957).\n\nRomansh is spoken by some 1% of Switzerland's 7.4 million inhabitants. It is the smallest of Switzerland's national languages in terms of number of speakers, and has not much to show in the way of literary activity. Fears of the language perishing altogether have spurred certain energetic groups to promote and foster a language revival. The five largest languages in the Romansh family are Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter and Vallader. Puter and Vallader are sometimes grouped together as one language: Ladin. Romansh was standardized in 1982. The unified language, called Rumantsch Grischun, is used by the federal government and the canton of Graubünden, where is it an official language, for administrative purposes.\n\nRomansh had a rich oral tradition before the appearance of Romansh writing, but apart from songs such as the \"Canzun da Sontga Margriata\", virtually none of it survives. Prior to the 16th century, Romansh writings are only known from a few fragments.\n\nThe oldest known written records identified as Romansh before 1500 are:\n\nThe emergence of Romansh as a literary language is generally dated to the mid-16th century. The first substantial surviving work in Romansh is a poem in Ladin, the \"Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da Müs\" written in the Putèr dialect in 1527 by Gian Travers (Johann von Travers, 1483–1563), though it was not published till 1865. It is an epic poem describing the First Musso war which Travers himself had taken part in.\n\nSubsequent works usually have religious themes, including Bible translations, manuals for religious instructions, and biblical plays. The first book printed in it (at Poschiavo in 1552) was the translation of a German catechism, and the next a translation of the New Testament: \"L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ\", also at Poschiavo, but in 1560, both works by Jachiam Bifrun/Giachem Bifrun. Most of the works in the Ladin dialects are translations of books of a religious or educational nature. Two years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the \"Cudesch da Psalms\", a collection of Romansh church songs in the Vallader dialect.\n\nIn the Sursilvan dialect, the first surviving works are also religious works such as catechism by Daniel Bonifaci and in 1611, \"Ilg Vêr Sulaz da pievel giuvan\" (\"The true joys of young people\"), a series of religious instructions for Protestant youths was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later in 1615, a catholic catechism \"Curt Mussament\" was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the new testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel. The first complete translation of the Bible, the \"Bibla da Cuera\" was published between 1717 and 1719.\n\nThe principal writers in the Romonsch dialects, generally the less literary of the two, in the 19th century are Theodor von Castelberg (1748–1830), a poet and translator of poetry, and P. A. de Latour (about 1811) also a poet, while the best of all poets in this dialect was Anton Huonder, whose lyrics are considered remarkable. Alexander Balletta (1842–1887) wrote prose romances and sketches, while J. C. Muoth (Giacun Hasper Muoth, 1844–1906), himself a most typical and characteristic figure, wrote much in prose and verse as regards his native region.\n\nIn Ladin one of the chief figures was the poet Conradin von Flugi (1787–1874), who published volumes of poems in 1845 and 1861, but the poems, novels and translations of Gian Fadri Caderas (1830–1891) are placed above them. Other Ladin poets are Florin Valentin, O. P. Juvalta and S. Caratsch (died 1892), while Peider Lansel (1863–1943) represents a younger generation. Zaccaria Pallioppi (1820–1873) also wrote poems, but the excellent Ladin dictionary that he compiled was not published till 1895 by the care of his son.\n\nNon-religious writings in Romansh began appearing in the second half of the 19th century in substantial numbers. The literary output of this period often deals with the language itself and is seen as part of the Romansh revival known as the \"Romansh Renaissance\". Most literature of the period consists of poetry and short stories praising the Romansh language and usually dealing with topics related to the rural background of the Romansh valleys. Another common theme is the emigration of the so-called \"Randulins\", who would spend much of their lives working abroad. In addition, many works were translated into Romansh, generally German writers that were popular at the time. Well-known Sursilvan poets of the time include Théodore de Castelberg (1748–1818), Placidus a Spescha (1752–1833) or Gion Antoni Huonder (1824–1867). The best-known Sursilvan poet is Giachen Caspar Muoth (1844–1906) however, who is often considered the most well-versed Romansh poet of all. His poets and ballads often deal with Romansh itself, such as his most famous work \"Al pievel romontsch\" (\"To the Romansh people\"):\n\nOther Sursilvan writers of the Romansh Renaissance include Caspar Decurtins (1855–1916), who collected among other things popular legends, ballads, and songs, as well as Giachen Michel Nay (1860–1920), who described rural life in several novels, Alfons Tuor (1871–1904), and Gian Fontana (1897–1935), who are also known for their novels. In addition, the priest Maurus Carnot (1865–1935) who had grown up in Samnaun but did not speak the Romansh dialect of his hometown, learned Sursilvan in Disentis and later wrote plays, lyric, and short stories dealing with rural life. Finally, Flurin Camathias is the author of several Sursilvan plays, poems, and epics, in addition to having translated numerous works into Romansh.\n\nLiterary works in Surmiran are comparatively rare, with Alexander Lozza from Murmarera being the most notable one.\n\nIn the Engadine, the first modern poets include Gian Battista Tschander and Conradin de Flug (1787–1874). Writers of the Romanticism era include Siméon Caratsch (1826–1891) and Gian Fadri Caderas (1830–1891), who co-authored some works such as the comedy \"Ils duos poets\". Other well-known poets and songwriters of the period include Andrea Bezzola (1840–1897), author of the song \"Ma bella Val, mi' Engiadina\", or Gudench Barblan (1860–1916), author of the song \"A la lingua materna\"\n\nAnother important Engadine figure of the period is Zaccaria Pallioppi (1820–1873). While he also wrote poems of his own, his main work is the first Ladin dictionary, published by his son in 1895. One of the first female writers is Clementina Gilli (1858–1942), who translated several major works of European literature and published a few original works as well, using the pseudonym \"Clio\". Other Engadine writers of the Romansh-Renaissance include Schimun Vonmoos (1868–1940), who wrote poets and short tales in addition to translating, Gian Gianett Cloetta (1874–1965) or Eduard Bezzola (1875–1948), who wrote dramas, comedies, and songs or translated them. The best-known Engadine poet is Peider Lansel (1863–1943) however, who retired at an early age in 1906 and dedicated himself to poetry, becoming one of the first Romansh writers to gain fame outside of his region. His work includes over 200 poems, which were published in several collections in 1907 (\"Primulas\"), 1912 (\"La cullana d'ambras\") and 1929 in his principal work \"Il vegl chalamêr\". In addition, his work includes several anthologies of Romansh poets, such as \"La musa ladina\" (1910) and \"La musa rumantscha\" (posthumous 1950). Shortly before his death, he became the first Romansh writer to receive the Grosser Schillerpreis.\n\nFrom the 1940s onwards, Romansh writers began to reflect on the widespread economical and social changes of traditional Romansh society and the word of modernity. Andri Peer (1921–1985) from the Lower Engadine is considered one of the first modern Romansh writers, whose works introduced modern literary trends into Romansh. His modern writing style was initially met with opposition, and he was not fully recognized and appreciated until much later. Another Engadine writer of this literary movement is Cla Biert (1920–1981), who became known for his humorous short stories. Notably Sursilvan writers include Flurin Darms (born 1918) for his lyrics, and Gion Battesta Sialm (1897–1977) and Guglielm Gadola (1902–1961) for their short stories. One of the more famous contemporary novelists is Toni Halter (1914–1986), who treated historic or rural themes in his works. Also known for his novels and short stories is the Sursilvan writer Gion Deplazes (born 1918). The Engadine writer Jon Semadeni (1910–1981) is the author of several theater plays and sketches, in addition to writing some prose as well. Also known for their plays are Men Gaudenz and Tista Murk (1915–1992) from the Val Müstair and Carli Fry (1897–1956) from Surselva. More recently, the Sursilvan writer Arno Camenisch (born 1978) gained attention outside the Romansh community for his novels and short stories, including the bilingual Romansh-German book \"Sez Ner\".\n\nConcerning children and young-adult books, some original works have been written in Romansh alongside a large number of translations. The most famous of these are the books of Selina Chönz, whose book \"Uorsin\" has become famous well outside of Switzerland in its German version Schellenursli. Other authors include Clo Duri Bezzola (\"Kindels dal malom\"), Göri Klainguti (\"Linard Lum\"), Linard Bardill (\"Il guaffen gelg\"), G. Netzer (\"Martin steiler, Annina, La princessa loscha\"), Theo Candinas (\"La fuigia dil Stoffel\") or Claudia Cadruvi (\"Capuns ed il stgazi dals Franzos\").\n\nDrama was represented by biblical plays, most notably the \"Passiuns sursilvanas\" (developed in 17th–18th century). From the 18th century, courtroom dramas based on criminal cases were added to the village repertoire. In the early 20th century, many villages would stage an annual vernacular comedy. Jon Semadeni established the \"La Culissa\" theatrical touring company in 1944. His drama \"Il pövel cumada\", which was first staged in 1946, is considered a landmark in Romansh drama. The company ceased touring in 1977.\n\nFrom the 1940s onwards, Romansh writers consciously attempted to assimilate influences from international literary movements, as well as reflecting the situation of traditional Romansh culture as a disappearing way of life in a world of modernity and change. In 1946, a Romansh writers’ union was established by Artur Caflisch and Jon Guidon, known since 2004 as ULR (\"Union for Romansh Literature\").\n\nThe Romansh writers are organized in the writer's union \"Uniun per la Litteratura Rumantscha\" established in 1946, which organizes since 1990 the yearly event \"Dis da Litteratura\" an annual Romansh literary festival has been held. Most writers today write in their regional dialect, while the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun is seeing increased use in works done by the Lia Rumantscha such as translations of children's books.\n\nOther writers include: Maurus Carnot (1846–1935), Giachen Michel Hay (1860–1920), Gian Fontana (1897–1935), Leza Uffer (1912–1982), Armon Planta (1917–1986), Gion Luregn Derungs, Gion Deplazes (born 1918), Cla Biert (1920–1981), Andri Peer (1921–1985), Martin Suter, Tim Krohn.\n\nIn the 2000s, Swiss production of books fluctuated between 10,000 and 12,000 titles per annum.\n\nIn 2007, the Swiss National Library recorded a total of 11,410 new titles produced by Swiss publishers. Of those, 6,631 were in German, 2,509 in French, 361 in Italian and 21 in Romansh; the rest being multilingual or in other languages. Taking all the languages combined, 1,983 new titles were in the field of literature proper. Other principal fields were musical publications (1,076 titles), the arts (1'019 titles), law (949 titles), religion (948 titles), languages (467 titles), technology (446 titles), geography (412 titles) and history (409 titles). 410 titles were translated from English, 200 from German and 157 from French. Books originating in 31 languages were translated into one or another of the national languages by Swiss publishers.\n\n\n"}

It is the burial place of the Ancient Egyptian royal family of Amarna, which reigned during the 18th dynasty. The cemetery is a local parallel to the Valley of the Kings.\n\nThere has been a great deal of work to ease access to the Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, and to protect the tombs from damage by flash flooding. The wadi can now be journeyed along on a metalled road, and the tomb is protected by a covering and channels to divert water away from its entrance. The angle of the entrance and descent allows sunlight (Aten) to reach all the way down to the burial chamber, however the tomb is unfinished and had it been finished at the time, sunlight would not have been able to reach the chamber.\n\nIn the wadi itself, there are 5 tombs, the Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, three unfinished tombs in a side wadi, and what seems to be a cache, near to the Royal Tomb.\n\nThe Royal Tomb (Tomb 26) is the only decorated tomb, and contained the burial of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten. It includes a suite of chambers for his daughters, his mother and probably Nefertiti, although she was never buried there.\n\nThe next of the tombs, Tomb 27, seems to have been intended for a Royal Burial, as the doorway and entrance are of a similar size to that of the Royal Tomb. However, it was never finished and no burial material has ever been found. It may have been intended for the burial of Akhenaten's successor.\n\nThis is the only finished tomb in the Wadi. It may have been used by a lesser wife of Akhenaten, perhaps Kiya and their child Baketaten (if she was their child and not a sister of Akhenaten).\n\nThis tomb was plastered, but never decorated. It consists of four corridors, and in plan is similar to the suite of rooms in the Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, and may have been intended for a lesser Royal Wife.\n\nA docket found in this tomb refers to a Year 1, so the tomb must have been open in the time of Akhenaten's successors.\n\n"}

It means salt making, customarily done during summer and became the leading industry among the coastal folks in the municipality. The festival is annually celebrated on December during the town fiesta. Usually celebrated with street dances during the 29th of December, participated by the 8 clustered Barangays. Then, after, a showdown is held showcasing the history, legends, the beautiful Pasuquin, and the Traditional Salt Making.\n\nAn American film, \"Sunflowers\" (1996), directed by Shawn Hainsworth, an Independent U.S. Film Director, has made the Sunflower Festival internationally known. The film garnered critics recognition in the 1997 Chicago Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and other Film festivals in North America.\n\nSunflower members are also active in participation of the annual town fiesta in December, the Mayflower festivities and religious celebrations like Holy Week.

The unpredictable weather makes this event very surprising, as May is known to be the first month of the year with heavy rains..\n\nStarted in 1992 through a Municipal Ordinance, Poblacion Dos is known to be the pioneer barangay to come up with a barangay fiesta title-\"RAMBAC TI DAYA\". This festivity culminates on the first two days of May, but usually preceded by an inter-zonal basketball tournament that runs for two to four weeks sponsored by the Sangguniang Kabataan..\n\nOne of the highlights of the festival is the community night, in which Barangay residents, local and foreign visitors gather together at the barangay plaza known as \"\"Plaza Murit\"\", for merry-making through community KTV, beer drinking, exchanging goodies, reuniting with good old folk, and simply enjoying and sharing abundant blessings.\n\nThe festival ends on the second day of May. A thanksgiving mass is offered in the first hour of the morning, followed by a motorists' parade downtown. After the motorcade, various \"Palarong Nayon\" are played by children and adult residents alike, where big prizes are at stake.\n\nAt night, the festival ends with a \"Sagalas/Santa Cruzan\", a tribute to \"Queen Elena\" on her way to the Holy Cross. The \"Flores de Mayo\" parades young kids as they are dressed in their respective personas.\n\nIn the \"Flores De Mayo\" program, the \"Gawad Rambac ti Daya, Most Outstanding Anak ti Dos\" is awarded to the most deserving resident that made great impact and unsurmounted selfless contributions through civil service, social work, religious, and human rights advocacy, and youth and sports development.\n\nAn annual fluvial parade festival started by the Davileneos, particularly the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Francis of Assisi. Davila is a coastal barangay of Pasuquin, and their main harvest is dumadara (a certain fish). They associated the festival to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom the Month of May is dedicated, as a thanksgiving for a bountiful fishing. Fisherfolks from Davila are made to decorate their bangkas (boats) for the fluvial parade. There are many activities hold also during the festival like boat race, and eating delectable grilled fish (Dumadara)with the guests.\n\nThe coastal town of Pasuquin celebrates its Holy Week with much religiosity and solemnity. The celebration starts on Palm Sunday (Domingo de Ramos) and ends on Easter Sunday (Domingo de Pascua). Each year, townspeople from all walks of life come together to celebrate the Most Holy Passion and Death of our Lord.\n\nThere are a total of 3 processions during Holy Week in St. James the Greater Parish, Pasuquin's Roman Catholic Church. The Holy Tuesday procession, better known as \"Estacion General\", Good Friday (the Holy Burial) and Easter Sunday (the \"Encuentro\" or \"Sabet\" in Ilocano). The processional images are enthroned in their respective carozzas with floral arrangements and elaborate lighting fixtures.\n\nDuring Good Fridays, the \"Stabat Mater\" in Latin is sung by a long array of \"cantoras\" (townspeople) following the Santo Entierro (Dead Christ). Pasuquin is the only remaining town in Ilocos that practices this beautiful tradition/heritage handed by its forebears. The singing of the \"Stabat Mater\" in Pasuquin has been in existence for more than a century.\n\n"}

It matched the East division champion St. Louis Cardinals (95–67) against the West division champion San Francisco Giants (90–72), with the Cardinals winning in seven games. The Cardinals would go on to lose the 1987 World Series to the Minnesota Twins, also in seven games.\n\nSan Francisco's Jeffrey Leonard was named the Series MVP despite the fact that his Giants lost the series. Oddly enough, this was the second consecutive year that the NLCS MVP came from the losing team, as Mike Scott had won the award with the Houston Astros the previous year. However, to date, Leonard is the last MVP of any postseason series (League Championship Series or World Series) to have played for the losing team.

Two more runs came across in the eighth for the Giants on a rare Ozzie Smith throwing error.\n\nIt was in this game that Leonard aroused the ire of the Cardinal fans by going into his \"Cadillac home run trot\" around the bases. Leonard spread out his arms, airplane-style, but kept his left arm pinned to his side (\"flap-down\"). To further irritate the fans, Leonard slowed to a walk between third and home.\n\nFriday, October 9, 1987, at Candlestick Park in San Francisco\nIn Game 3, Joe Magrane (STL) and Atlee Hammaker (SF) were set to face off. The matchup was not expected to be quite as low scoring as the series had been to date. The predictions were correct, as San Francisco broke first with four runs in the first three innings, looking to take the series lead. In the second inning, consecutive hits from Chili Davis, Will Clark and Bob Brenly put the Giants on the board. Yet another home run from Leonard tacked on a fourth run in the third.\n\nOn Leonard's next at-bat, however, Bob Forsch, who had relieved starter Magrane, plunked Leonard in the left shoulder with his first pitch, presumably in retaliation for his home-run trot antics. The Giants would load the bases in the inning with one out, but Forsch pitched out of it.\n\nThe Cardinals heated things up in the sixth with a two-run home run from Jim Lindeman, who replaced the injured Jack Clark, and then a triple by Willie McGee. But, in the seventh is when they really made their attack, not only tying the game, but scoring four to take the lead, 6–4. The four runs came on a large rally, highlighted by a two-run single by left fielder Vince Coleman.\n\nWith right-handed Todd Worrell pitching for the Cards, manager Roger Craig pinch hit left-handed batter Harry Spilman for Robby Thompson. Spilman homered to right field, putting new life back in the Giants, even with two down. However, third baseman Kevin Mitchell flew out to center field, and the Cards had completed a stunning comeback.\n\nCardinals slugger Jack Clark made his only appearance in the Series in Game 3. Nursing a sprained ankle, he came up as a pinch-hitter and struck out looking. His injury caused him to be left off the roster for the World Series, so the Cardinals could add another pitcher.\n\nSaturday, October 10, 1987, at Candlestick Park in San Francisco\nThe Giants knotted the series at 2–2 by the longball and another complete-game pitching performance, this time by Mike Krukow. Krukow was touched for two runs in the second on RBI singles by opposing pitcher Danny Cox and Vince Coleman, but then pitched shutout ball the rest of the way. Robby Thompson hit a homer in the fourth, Jeffrey Leonard put the Giants ahead 3–2 in the fifth with his fourth homer in the NLCS, and Bob Brenly closed out the scoring with a shot in the eighth.\n\nSunday, October 11, 1987, at Candlestick Park in San Francisco\nTom Herr put the Cardinals up 1–0 in the first off Rick Reuschel with a sacrifice fly, then the Giants tied it in their half of the first on a Kevin Mitchell RBI single.\n\nThe Cardinals looked on the verge of breaking it open against Reuschel in the third. Tony Peña and pitcher Bob Forsch led off the inning with consecutive singles, and then Vince Coleman beat out a bunt, loading the bases with none out. Ozzie Smith could only produce a sacrifice fly, however, and Herr bounced into a double play to end the threat. Mitchell tied it at 2–2 for the Giants in the third on a homer.\n\nTerry Pendleton then gave the Cards back the lead in the fourth in this nip-and-tuck game by smashing a two-out triple and scoring when Reuschel mishandled a throw by Will Clark on a ground ball hit by John Morris.\n\nThe Giants answered back in the bottom of the fourth when Jose Uribe drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single for a 4–3 Giants lead. Mike Aldrete then pinch-hit for Reuschel and hit a sacrifice fly and Robby Thompson drove in the last run with a triple. Joe Price then relieved Reuschel and pitched five innings of one-hit, shutout relief.\n\nThompson's RBI would be the last Giants run of the series.\n\nTuesday, October 13, 1987, at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri\nFacing elimination, the Cardinals rolled out their ace, John Tudor, to face Dave Dravecky once again. Tudor was injured for most of the first half of 1987, but rebounded to go 10–2 in the second half of the season. And, like his great 1985 season, Tudor was golden in the postseason. He scattered six hits in seven innings and struck out six before giving way to Todd Worrell.\n\nTudor got the only run he needed in the second inning when Tony Peña hit what appeared to be a routine fly ball to right, but Candy Maldonado misplayed it and it fell for a triple. José Oquendo then drove Pena home with a sacrifice fly.\n\nKen Dayley pitched the ninth for his second save of the series.\n\nWednesday, October 14, 1987, at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri\nThe Cardinals gave starter Danny Cox a quick 4–0 lead by jumping on Giants starter Atlee Hammaker in the second. Singles by Terry Pendleton, Tony Peña and Willie McGee produced the first run and José Oquendo, who had hit only one home run during the regular season, drilled a three-run shot to left. St. Louis added two more runs in the sixth on a two-run single by Tommy Herr. Cox went the distance, scattering eight hits and striking out five. The victory gave the Cardinals their third pennant in six years and fifteenth overall. The only downside in the victory was Pendleton suffering a strained ribcage while running the bases, which limited his availability in the World Series.\n\n1987 NLCS (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals over San Francisco Giants\nCardinals Hitting Bests:\n\n\nGiants Hitting Bests:\n\n\nCardinals Pitching Bests:\n\n\nGiants Pitching Bests:\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe present name of San Nicolas was given in the year 1733, after Saint Nicholas de Tolentino who was believed to have protected the people against floods, earthquakes, fires, typhoons and other calamities. It is significant that in Ilocos Norte, only San Nicolas was named after a Saint.\n\nLike any other town in the ancient province of Ilocos Province, San Nicolas was established by Augustinian missionaries. Vigan, the first Spanish mission center in this region, was founded in 1575. In the year 1572, when the Spaniards first explored the Laoag (Padsan) River, they met hostile resistance from the natives of San Nicolas and Laoag. In another expedition dispatched from Vigan in 1584 San Nicolas was established and Laoag followed a year later.\n\nSan Nicolas Catholic Church built in 1701 is one of the oldest buildings in this province. Its original structure is one of the must see places of the town. The Church and the attached Santa Rosa Academy Building, the well preserved Municipal Hall and the old Town Plaza sprawled between them constitute the heart of the town center. These buildings and structures are originally built and continue to be festooned with earthen bricks, which is among the products of the surviving locals.\n\nSan Nicolas is from Metro Manila and from Laoag City, the provincial capital.\n\nThe Municipality of San Nicolas is politically divided into 24 barangays:\n\nSan Nicolas has a tropical savanna climate with warm to hot temperatures year round. Temperatures dips sightly during the winter months between December to February. \n\nIn the , the population of San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, was people, with a density of .\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion in the Philippines and is likewise the same in San Nicolas.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is known as the birthplace of Ferdinand Marcos, the 10th President of the Philippines and for Sarrat Church, the largest church in the province and with the longest nave in the country and an Important Cultural Property of the Philippines.\n\nCabayugan was how the people called Sarrat by its first settlers led by the village chief Minagel (Maingel) Bang'at and his wife Sarrah, before the arrival of the Spaniards on the latter part of the 16th century. Sarrat is a compound of the couple's names and is believed to be coined by their son Garo.\n\nCabayugan or Sarrat was established in 1586 as an Augustinian visita of Laoag. It became an independent parish in 1724. Sarrat was annexed to San Nicolas on May 7, 1740. During the revolt of 1815, many houses were burned to the ground and the town was left in shambles. After the revolt, the poblacion was transferred to its present site.\n\nUpon the partition of Ilocos province in 1818, Sarrat was designated as the capital of Ilocos Norte until its transfer to Laoag within the year.\n\nIt boasts of a colorful and violent history: the whole town joined the Basi Revolt of 1807; rose up in arms again in 1815 during the Sarrat Rebellion of which the hated housekeeper of the parish priest, Rosa Agcaoili, was killed and dismembered; and revolted against the Americans in 1899 under the leadership of Don Pepe Ver. In 1910, the court returned Sarrat's church and convent to the Catholics and a day later, the Aglipayan parish priest, Fr. Mariano Edralin, was found murdered. The beautiful church of Santa Monica was started to be built by Fr. Isidro Champaner (OSA) in 1848. It is probably the biggest Spanish-era church in Ilocos Norte. Its original roof truss of logs is still intact.\n\nAfter the colonization of the Spaniards, the town was renamed to San Miguel when the Augustinians erected a parish coinciding with the gaining of its township status on September 29, 1724. Two then Senators, Santiago Fonacier and Isabelo delos Reyes, eventually created the bill that changed the town's name from San Miguel to Sarrat in 1916.\n\nSarrat's former names were Cabayugan meaning place where bayug (a kind of bamboo) grows, San Miguel de Cunning (meaning “saffron” which used to be harvested abundantly in the region) and San Miguel de Sarrat. Its name was changed from San Miguel to Sarrat in 1916.\n\nThe Sarrat Heroes monument erected at the town plaza symbolizes the heroism and bravery of all Sarrateños. \"Ritritem'mon Kayong\" was their war cry that still echoes on the true-blooded Sarrateños.\n\nSarrat is situated geographically just southeast of Laoag City, the capital of the province. Sarrat is bounded by the cities and municipalities of Batac to the south-west, San Nicolas to the west, Laoag to the north-west, Piddig to the north-east, Dingras to the east, the town of Marcos to the southeast, and a small portion of Banna to the south. The town is traversed and divided into two by the Padsan River, creating a north and south areas that are connected by the Sarrat Bridge.\n\nSarrat is politically subdivided into 24 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Sarrat was people, with a density of .\n\nThe Santa Monica Parish Church, commonly known as the Sarrat Church, is the largest church in Ilocos Norte and the most visited place by tourists in Sarrat. The church has one of the longest nave in the country and was declared an Important Cultural Property of the Philippines in September 2009.\n\nThe 105-meters long (the longest in the country) Church of St. Monica, first built in 1779 by the Augustinian friars, was the last Spanish church built in the Ilocos. It was destroyed on March 3, 1816, was rebuilt in 1848, burned again in 1882, repaired from 1875 to 1895 and finished between 1895 and 1898. Its bell tower was damaged during the March 19, 1932 earthquake. It has a unique, massive, 3-level and attractive brick staircase connecting the church with the convent. On one side of the church is the eight-foot high image of St. Monica. The church interior, along with the houses surrounding the plaza, were renovated in 1983 for Irene Marcos' (the youngest daughter of the late Pres. Marcos) wedding to Greggy Araneta. A few months later, on August 16, an Intensity 7.8 earthquake severely damaged the church's main altar and upper facade.\n\nThe impressive convent, known as the Casa del Palacio Real, was first built in 1779, completely burned on February 3, 1816, and was reconstructed in 1817 and 1886. It was, at times, used as a Presidencia Municipal during the American era. Within its environs, then were a jail where criminals and political prisoners were incarcerated and tortured, a sala court, a strangulation room and other secular sections. It also served, for a time, as the Colegio de Santa Monica (a branch of the Liceo de Manila). The convent was damaged during the March 19, 1932 earthquake and was repaired, in turns. In 1977, both church and convent were completely restored, with government assistance. The ground floor houses church memorabilia, church vestments and historical books and photographs. Souvenir items (T-shirts) are also sold here.\n\nThe former 3-storey, square brick belfry of diminishing sizes, probably the largest in the province, has lost its top storeys. It once had a clock on the dome.\n\nThe Santa Monica Parish Museum is a repository of artifacts and memorabilia that dates back to the construction of the church edifice in 1779. It was established in 1993 on the initiative of its parish priest, Rev. Msgr. Jacinto A. Jose and Rev. Edmundo M. Abaya, D.D., Bishop of the Diocese of Laoag.\n\nIt was completed and put in its present form in 1997 with the help of the Kannawidan Foundation Inc., The iloko Foundation for Arts and Culture. This organization is dedicated to the preservation of the cultural and historical heritage of the people of Ilocos Norte under the following officers and directors. Francis Ablan, Maximino J.

It is located at barangay San Joaquin (Barrio Uno) and is maintained by private entrepreneurs from the same barangay. These nipa huts are seasonal: built around December purposely for the summer season and are dismantled at the start of the rainy season. The nipa huts not only offer shade and comfort to the visitors but are equipped with Videoke system to complete the entertainment.\n\nGoing around the poblacion is served by the tricycles (Filipino: traysikel), a local term for a motorized transport made by pairing a motorcycle with a locally fabricated sidecar. These are also used to transport commuters to other remote barangays but usually through a special fare, the amount of which depends on what is agreed upon before the trip.\n\nA regular and daily trip to neighboring Laoag City is provided by jeepneys, the main form of transportation. All jeepneys that ply the route are members of the Laoag-Sarrat Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association (LSJODA). Travel time takes around 15 minutes each way on a usual day.\n\nSarrat offers its constituency up to secondary education.

It is the third television series to feature the characters from the Disney franchise based on A. A. Milne's works; the other two were the live action \"Welcome to Pooh Corner\" (to which this series bears resemblance) and the animated \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" which ran from 1988–1991. It premiered on January 22, 2001 and completed its run on November 29, 2004. It was repeated on Playhouse Disney until September 4, 2005 (May 2007 in the UK). The show is produced by Shadow Projects. Walt Disney Home Entertainment released a direct-to-video spin-off film based on the television series titled \"\" in 2001.\n\nThe show became available to stream on Disney+ on its launch, November 12, 2019.\n\nThe series appears to take place some time after the events of Milne's original stories since his son Christopher Robin Milne is clearly a sixth grader and 11 years old. The series departs from many of the established facts of Milne's books; for example, Tigger resides in the Hundred Acre Wood from the start and Kanga and Roo are later introduced as newcomers. Neither Christopher nor his mother speak with an English accent, such is the case in \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" where Christopher has an American accent. Kessie, the bluebird from \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" episodes \"Find Her, Keep Her\" and \"A Bird in the Hand\" returns as a main character in this series.\n\nEach show begins entering Christopher Robin's bedroom and hearing his mother say \"Christopher, time for school.\" Christopher Robin answers \"OK, Mom!\", grabs his backpack and leaves. This is where the book with Pooh and his friends in it opens and the theme song begins. The show can be viewed as non-canonical in other ways. For example, Tigger likes—or at least is shown to eat—honey (compared with most other adaptations where \"Tiggers don't like honey!\") and can climb up—but more importantly climb down from trees and Christopher Robin's face is never shown. Plus, in this show as well as \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\", Rabbit lives in a tree, as opposed to living in a burrow in other adaptations.\n\nThe characters in the show regularly sing and dance in ways that enhance the story being told. Many of the episodes do not have much basis in the original stories by A.A. Milne besides the characters.\n\nThe design and animation of the show were done by Chris Renaud, who would later become the co-director of the 2010 film \"Despicable Me\".\n\nThe characters who appear regularly and the actors who voice them are:\n\nThe versions of Tigger and Pooh seen on this show later made an appearance in a music video by the We Are Family foundation.\n\n\nThe style of puppetry is based on Japanese bunraku puppetry, and that — along with the cut-out-styled backgrounds — gives the show the look of a pop-up book, hence \"The Book of Pooh\". It was the first use of the Shadowmation process developed by creator Mitchell Kriegman which was later used in the PBS series \"It's a Big Big World\".\n\n\nThe series received three Emmy Awards nominations, and tied with Sesame Street for Outstanding Directing in a Children's Series at the 29th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2002.\n\n\"\" is a direct-to-video animated spin-off based on the television series \"The Book of Pooh\". It was produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

{"id": "2068117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068117", "title": "Men &amp; Motors", "text": "Men &amp; Motors\n\nMen & Motors was a men's lifestyle television channel in the UK. It was the last remaining station operated by the former Granada Sky Broadcasting joint venture, set up by Granada Television (now part of ITV plc) and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting in 1996. Although ITV plc is now the sole owner of GSB (since renamed ITV Digital Channels Limited), Sky will receive 49.5 per cent of any proceeds (net of liabilities) if Men & Motors is sold.\n\nA possible merger with ITV4 had been on the cards, but in September 2007 ITV confirmed that it planned to dispose of Men & Motors. Men & Motors closed on 1 April 2010 to make way for ITV HD on Freesat, Sky Digital and Virgin Media.\n\nFrom its launch, Men & Motors was only available with subscription television services. It was part of the original line-up (as a \"primary channel\") for ITV Digital, a Digital terrestrial television service part-owned by Granada. When ONdigital closed, Men & Motors left DTT and became available only through satellite and cable. On 1 November 2004, ITV took full control of GSB and shut down Plus, which only averaged 0.7% of its audience share before ITV3 replaced this ill-fated channel.\n\nThe channel really took off after the appointment of Gary Shoefield as director of programming. He quickly set about changing the presenters and the look and feel and took responsibility for both the acquisitions and the newly produced programmes.\n\nThe channel was split into 2 distinctive halves with Motors content before 11 pm and Adult content thereafter.\nShoefield brought Jordan (Katie Price) to the Adult part of the channel along with Jo Guest, Catherine McQueen, Mike Reid, Roy \"Chubby\" Brown, Garry Bushell and James Whale.\n\nNames that joined the Motors team included Gary Numan, Vanilla Ice, Ginny Buckley, Richard Hammond, John Inverdale and Princess Tamara. The channel saw huge growth under Shoefield's control and Men and Motors became a household name until November 2004, when ITV acquired GSkyB and rebranded Plus as ITV3.\n\nMany years after the closure of ITV Digital, ITV (the company formed by the merger of Carlton Television and Granada) successfully bid for a slot on digital terrestrial (DTT) multiplex D. It was announced that Men & Motors would be launched on Freeview on 2 May 2005. To coincide with this launch, the channel was re-vamped, and its late night, risqué adult content was replaced by archive drama, comedy and documentaries. The channel also dropped its Videoguard encryption on Sky Digital on 1 July 2005, switching to free-to-air status.\n\nITV's plans to launch a channel aimed at men (the target audience of Men & Motors) were considered by many to be the end for Men & Motors. It seemed logical that Men & Motors would simply \"become\" ITV4, with much of the channel's programming simply being shown under the ITV brand. With capacity on the Freeview platform limited, and to avoid being in competition for the same genre of viewers, this seemed the inevitable conclusion.\n\nHowever, available to a much wider audience, Men & Motors enjoyed a (slightly unexpectedly) sharp increase in viewing figures. ITV were faced with the conundrum of replacing a channel with a well-known brand and enjoying a new popularity with a new, seemingly identical channel. ITV4 instead replaced the ITV News Channel on Freeview (between its broadcasting hours of 18:00 to 06:00), with Men & Motors still available on its own 24-hour slot. The News channel closed soon after, due to major competition from Sky News and BBC News 24 and heavy financial losses. It was replaced fully by ITV4 and the CITV Channel.\n\nAfter less than a year on Freeview, Men & Motors had now been replaced. At 06:00 BST on 12 April 2006, Men & Motors ceased transmissions on digital terrestrial television. This was to allow ITV to launch the \"participation television\" channel, ITV Play, which has since been closed down itself. With limited bandwidth on the platform, and a desire to keep the entire ITV \"family\" (i.e. all channels carrying the ITV brand) on the free platform, Men & Motors was only available on satellite and cable television at the time of its closure.\n\nOn 2 April 2010, ITV HD launched on Sky Digital channel 178, replacing Men & Motors. As a result, Men & Motors closed on 1 April at 6 a.m. on both Freesat and Sky Digital. On Virgin Media, Men & Motors was removed from the EPG on 25 March 2010 for \"operational reasons\" to add an ITV HD launch information screen. Most of the programmes that were shown on Men & Motors moved over to ITV4.\n\nOn 11 December 2012, One Media iP announced that they had acquired all of the trademarks and content rights of Men & Motors, including approximately 1,600 hours of programming. One Media are currently re-packaging the content for sale across a variety of digital platforms including the iTunes Store and YouTube. The original Men & Motors footage including full episodes and clips are available to watch on the Official Men & Motors YouTube channel.\n\n"}

It required the federal government to favor returning war veterans when hiring new employees in an attempt to recognize their service, sacrifice, and skills.\n\nThe use of preference in Federal appointments extends back to the days of the Revolutionary War. Though no legal basis existed to govern the treatment of war veterans, certain soldiers were rewarded for their service by the Federal government. Early forms of preference were often based on European models and featured the use of pensions, bonuses for service, disability allowance, and hospitalization for injuries incurred while in uniform, as rewards for service to one's country. It wasn't until the heyday of the spoils system, however, that appointments to Federal positions as a reward for military service become a popular practice. These appointments, however, were usually reserved for ex-officers, and not for the rank and file soldier.\n\nTowards the end of the Civil War, Congress passed the first significant veterans' preference legislation. This act provided that:\n\nUnder this legislation, preference in appointments was limited to disabled veterans who were otherwise qualified for the work to be performed. This 1865 law stood as the basic preference legislation until the end of World War I.\nAlong the way, however, several modifications were made to the 1865 legislation. An amendment in 1871 contained the first instance of \"suitability\" requirements for job seeking veterans. The language read as follows:\nIn 1876, another Congressional amendment gave preference for RIF retention to veterans, their widows, and their orphans. This amendment marked the introduction of the use of preference as RIF protection. It provided:\n\nDetermination of the \"equal qualifications\" of a person entitled to preference under this law was left to the appointing officer.\n\nIn 1888, a Civil Service Commission regulation gave absolute preference to all disabled veterans over all other eligibles. In other words, they would qualify with a score of 65, when the minimum passing score for everyone else was a 70, and would be placed at the top of the certification list.\n\nA year later, President Harrison issued an Executive Order allowing honorably discharged veterans who were former Federal employees to be reinstated without time limit. This was the first appearance of reinstatement eligibility as applied to veterans. In 1892, reinstatement rights were extended to the widows and orphans of veterans. The reinstatement provision was the last significant addition to preference legislation until 1919.\n\nThe first major expansion of Veterans' Preference benefits occurred in 1919 in the form of the Census Act. This act, amended shortly thereafter by the Deficiency Act of 1919 granted preference to all honorably discharged veterans, their widows, and the wives of injured veterans. An excerpt reads as follows:\n\nThis act is significant for two reasons: it no longer emphasized a service-connected disability as the primary basis for granting veterans' preference, and it introduced the concept of spousal preference in the appointing process. This act redefined eligible veterans to mean all persons who served in an active military capacity and were honorably discharged, whether the service was in wartime or peacetime. Added were their widows and the wives of those too disabled to qualify for government employment. This act remained the basic Federal law for appointment preference until June 27, 1944, when the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 was enacted.\n\nTwo significant modifications were made to the 1919 Act. In 1923, an Executive Order was created which added 10 points to the score of disabled veterans and added 5 points to the scores of non-disabled veterans. This was the first time the points were added to the examination scores in the appointing process. Under this Executive Order, however, veterans were no longer placed at the top of the certification lists. In 1929, another executive order restored the placement of 10 point disabled veterans to the top of certification lists.\n\nIn 1938, a Civil Service Commission rule required that the decision by an appointing official to pass over a veteran and select a non-veteran for appointment be subject to review by the commission. Language regarding the pass-over of eligible veterans existed in earlier executive orders, but these early versions only required that the CSC be notified if a pass-over occurred. The 1938 rule strengthened this requirement and marked the first time that the Commission could overturn the pass-over if it did not regard the reasons as being adequate.\n\nVeterans' preference, as it exists today, derives from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944. This act, to a large extent, resulted from the veterans organizations' desire to elevate the existing Executive and regulatory orders governing preference to the level of National policy. With a victorious end to World War II clearly in sight, both Congress and the Administration were sympathetic to the veterans organizations' objective. In his endorsement of the legislation, President Roosevelt wrote,\n\"I believe that the Federal Government, functioning in its capacity as an employer, should take the lead in assuring those who are in the armed forces that when they return special consideration will be given to them in their efforts to obtain employment. It is absolutely impossible to take millions of our young men out of their normal pursuits for the purpose of fighting to preserve the Nation, and then expect them to resume their normal activities without having any special consideration shown them.\"\n\nThe act, in essence, was a consolidation of the various preference provision already in effect by the various Executive Orders and CSC regulations. It went a step further by broadening and strengthening existing veterans' preference rules by giving them legislative sanction. Thus, the Executive Branch could no longer change the provisions of veterans' preference. Any changes must now be sought through legislation. In addition, the act made clear that preference was to be a reward for patriotic duties by a grateful country willing to recognize the sacrifices of its servicemen when peace comes. The Act would help ensure that veterans obtain or regain an economic position they otherwise would have attained had they not served in the armed forces.\nThe Veterans preference Act of 1944 defined to whom and under what circumstances preference would be granted. It provided that Preference be given in competitive examinations, in appointments to positions in the Federal service, in reinstatement to positions, in reemployment, and in retention during reductions in force. Preference would apply to civilian positions — permanent or temporary ;— in all departments, agencies, bureaus, administrations, establishments, and projects of the Federal Government, and in the civil service of the District of Columbia. Further, the law provided that preference apply to positions in the classified civil service (now the competitive service), the unclassified civil service (positions excepted from the competitive service), and in any temporary or emergency establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project and department created by acts of Congress or Presidential Executive order. The legislative and judicial branches of the Government, as well as positions in the executive branch, which are required to be confirmed by the United States Senate, except Postmaster-ships, in the first-, second-, and third-class post offices were exempt from the Act.\n\nThe Act originally granted preference to non-disabled veterans, disabled veterans, wives of disabled veterans, and the widows of disabled veterans. These were substantially the same groups granted preference under previous laws and regulations with two exceptions. Non-disabled veterans whose only service was performed during peacetime and the wives of non-service-connected disabled veterans over 55 years of age were no longer eligible for preference.\n\nIn 1948, the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 was amended to include the mothers of veterans. Mother preference was granted to certain widowed, divorced, or legally separated mothers of veterans (men and women) who\nIn the case of such widowed mothers, preference was granted provided they were widowed at the time of death or disability of the veteran and had not remarried. The divorced or legally separated mothers were granted preference only if the veteran was the mother's only child. This provision was later amended in 1950 to allow preference to mothers who are living with their husbands but whose husbands are totally and permanently disabled.\n\nIn 1952, a bill was passed granting preference benefits to those honorably separated veterans who served on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States during the period beginning April 28, 1952 and ending July 1, 1955 (the period after the termination of the state of war between the United States and the Government of Japan during which persons could be inducted under existing law for training and service in the armed forces). The bill also extended preference to the widows and mothers of such veterans.\n\nThe Vietnam War in the 1960s resulted in several modifications of the VP law of 1944. In 1966, legislation was passed which granted peace-time preference for Vietnam-era vets who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days between January 31, 1955 and October 10, 1976; National guard and reserve service was excluded from this legislation.\n\nIn 1967 legislation was passed which expanded preference to all veterans who served on active duty for more than 180 days (no requirement to serve during war, campaign, or conflict) between January 31, 1955 and October 10, 1976. As with the previous year's law, National guard and reserve service was not included in this expansion.\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War brought with it yet another law, passed in 1976. This law put added restrictions on veterans whose service begins after October 14, 1976. For post-Vietnam era veterans, preference was granted only if these veterans became disabled, or served in a declared war, a campaign, or expedition. This legislation was the result of the conclusion of the Vietnam War and its draft and the United States Department of Defense's desire to build a career military service.\n\nThe Civil Service reform act of 1978 created new benefits for veterans with a 30 percent or more disability. It also gave veterans extra protection in hiring and retention. Under this act, preference was no longer granted to nondisabled veterans who retired at the rank of major or above.\n\nIn 1988, a law was passed that required the Department of Labor to report agencies' violations of veterans' preference and failure to list vacancies with State employment services to the Office of Personnel Management for enforcement.\n\nThe last major legislation affecting veterans' preference occurred in the form of the Defense Appropriations act of 1997. Under this legislation, preference was accorded to anyone who served on active duty during the Gulf War period (August 2, 1990 through January 2, 1992). This law also granted preference to certain service members who earned campaign medals for service in Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor (November 20, 1995 through December 20, 1996) or Operation Joint Guard (December 20, 1996 through a date designated by the Secretary of Defense).\n\n"}

He is one of the self-proclaimed originators of \"lit-hop\" and was one of the first rappers to sample and reference post-punk, pop punk, and emo bands.\n\nHe is the founder and CEO of the independent record label Horris Records. He is one of several people who claim to have coined the term iGeneration, which he is credited with doing in 2003.\n\nLars attended Stevenson School, a high school in Pebble Beach, California. For college and graduate school, he attended Stanford University and Oxford University.\n\nHe has recorded for Truck Records in the UK, Sidecho Records in the United States, Big Mouth Records in Japan, and Shock Records in Australia. He was formerly known as MC Lars Horris but changed his pseudonym to MC Lars in 2004 for purposes of simplicity.\n\nIn 2006, he released the single \"Download This Song\", which entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 29.\n\nIn 2006, Lars worked with the Canadian independent record label Nettwerk Records to release \"The Graduate\". Following this release, Lars toured extensively throughout the US, then he toured UK and did shows in Japan, and Australia. Not long after the album was released on iTunes, Lars received an e-mail from a 15-year-old fan Elisa Greubel on his web forum saying she identified with \"Download This Song\" since her family was one of many being sued by the Recording Industry Association of America. This led to Nettwerk executive Terry McBride and a team of major-label artists managed by Nettwerk to support the Greubels with their case. MC Lars returned to the UK in October 2006.\n\nIn April 2007, MC Lars and Nettwerk made the component tracks for his single \"White Kids Aren't Hyphy\" available for remix under a by-nc-sa Creative Commons license on the Jamglue online mixing site as a contest. In May, MC Lars toured the UK on the third installment of the Good To Go Tour, making friends with Wheatus front man Brendan B. Brown. In July Lars and Brown recorded new songs, two of which would later appear on This Gigantic Robot Kills. In November, Lars returned to the UK on tour with pop-punk band Last Letter Read who performed their own set and then on stage with Lars, debuting Lars' new song \"Hey There Ophelia\".\nIn 2008 and 2009, Lars worked with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Wheatus, the Rondo Brothers, Nick Rowe and Mike Kennedy of Bloodsimple, Daniel Dart of Time Again, Pierre Bouvier of Simple Plan, MC Bat Commander of the Aquabats, Suburban Legends, Worm Quartet, Gabriel Saporta of Cobra Starship, Brett Anderson of the Donnas, MC Frontalot, Jesse Dangerously, Jaret Reddick of Bowling for Soup, Adil Omar, Linus Dotson of Size 14, Parry Gripp of Nerf Herder, Jonathan Coulton, Aesias Finale, Sebastian Reynolds, Joe Ragosta of Patent Pending and classical musician Walt Ribeiro to complete his album \"This Gigantic Robot Kills\".\n\nNielsen has opened for Snoop Dogg, I Fight Dragons, the Matches, Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Simple Plan, Bowling for Soup, Gym Class Heroes, Say Anything, Streetlight Manifesto, Suburban Legends, Test Icicles, Jack's Mannequin, Patent Pending, Bayside, Fightstar, MC Frontalot, mc chris, Wheatus, the Aquabats, T-Pain, Yung Joc, Cartel, Zebrahead. and Insane Clown Posse.\n\nOriginally releasing tracks under the name Lars Horris, and then MC Lars Horris, Nielsen eventually dropped Horris (which later became the name of his record label), becoming MC Lars. Lars plays with a laptop and occasionally a punk rock band to back him up, which he refers to as \"post-punk laptop rap\".\nSamples from bands such as Supergrass, Piebald, Brand New, Fugazi, and Iggy Pop play a key role in MC Lars's music. Hearts That Hate, whose song \"Cry Tonight\" is sampled in Lars' \"Signing Emo\", is a fictional group created by the rapper. The Grammy-nominated Texan band Bowling for Soup performed as Hearts That Hate when MC Lars has supported them on tour. A full version of \"Cry Tonight\" is available as a B-side to the UK \"Signing Emo\" single.\n\nMC Lars has also shown an interest in using lyrics and song titles based on English and American literature. \"Rapbeth\" references William Shakespeare's play \"Macbeth\", while \"Mr. Raven\" is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\". \"Ahab\" is about the novel \"Moby Dick\" and \"Hey There Ophelia\" on \"This Gigantic Robot Kills\" retells the story of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".\n\nThe term \"iGeneration\", coined by Lars in 2003, was used to describe the generation born primarily in the mid-to-late 1980s, was used in his song of the same name and given out for free to Facebook users in August 2006 in conjunction with iTunes. In early 2006, his song \"Download This Song\" was featured on the pop-culture CBC Radio show \"Definitely Not The Opera\".\n\nFollowing 2004's the Laptop EP, Lars continued to grow his independent record label Horris Records. Horris served as an imprint of Nettwerk and Oglio before becoming self-distributed. In 2008, Horris signed a two-record distribution deal with Crappy Records, founded by Jaret Reddick, from the American rock band Bowling For Soup. In 2011, Horris signed Weerd Science.\n\nHaving his own label allowed Lars to experiment creatively. \"Lars Attacks!\" was a return to basics, with less punk elements and more standard hip-hop stylings, funded by Kickstarter, featuring cameos from KRS-One, Sage Francis and Mac Lethal. MC Lars used Kickstarter to fund a \"Greatest Hits\" album on vinyl, which also included his \"Edgar Allan Poe EP\". On November 6, 2015, Lars released the Zombie Dinosaur LP, his fourth official album. \nThe name Horris Records is derived from a cartoon character Lars created in middle school which also served as the basis for Lars' original stage name, MC Lars Horris, named after a character from Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman.\n\nOn stage, Lars has been joined by Wheatus, Bowling for Soup, Simple Plan, the Matches and Failsafe. While supporting Zebrahead in the UK and Europe in 2010, Ed Udhus, Greg Bergdorf and tour manager Bobby Conner joined Lars on stage. In 2019 MC Lars took to the stage with Newcastle-based unsigned alt rock outfit, Ruled By Raptors, as his backing band in the UK as part of his 10-year anniversary celebrations for This Gigantic Robot Kills. On the tour, MC Lars mentioned this was the first time that he had performed with a band without any form of backing track, instead relying on the band to recreate everything instrumentally or with samples and triggers.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2068200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068200", "title": "SpVgg Unterhaching", "text": "SpVgg Unterhaching\n\nSpielvereinigung Unterhaching () is a German sports club in Unterhaching, a semi-rural municipality on the southern outskirts of the Bavarian capital Munich. The club is widely known for playing in the first-division association football league Bundesliga alongside its more famous cousins, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, for two seasons between 1999 and 2001, while the club's bobsleigh department has captured several world and Olympic titles. The football team plays in the 3. Liga (third tier).\n\nOriginally part of the gymnastics and sports club TSV Hachinger, SpVgg Unterhaching was established as an independent football club on 1 January 1925. Their first promotion to a higher division came in 1931 and they went on to be promoted to the A-Klasse a year later. However, the club was dissolved in 1933 as it was regarded as \"politically unreliable\" by the Nazis and was not re-established until after the end of World War II in 1945 to resume play in the amateur fourth division B-Klasse.\n\nUnterhaching's football team was only an anonymous local amateur team with no significant successes until a climb through league ranks that began in 1976 with promotion from B-Klasse to A-Klasse play. A first-place finished earned the club quick promotion to the Bezirksliga in 1977. Continued good play put the team into the fourth-division Landesliga Bayern-Süd in 1979 and then the Oberliga Bayern (III), the highest amateur division at the time, by 1981.\n\nUnterhaching finished first there in 1983 to earn an appearance in the playoff round for the 2. Bundesliga, but failed to advance. They suffered a similar fate in 1988 when they next appeared in the promotion round.\n\nThe club finally emerged from the Oberliga to play in the 2. Bundesliga in 1989, but were quickly relegated after a 20th-place finish. Promoted a second time in 1992, they were once again sent down after a marginally better 18th-place result. Unterhaching next appeared in the second division in 1995 after a first-place finish in the new Regionalliga Süd (III).\n\nWith their return to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1995–96 season the club would begin a period that would see them earn their best ever results. They finished 4th that season, then slipped to 6th and 11th-place results in their next two campaigns before securing promotion to the top-flight Bundesliga after a 2nd-place finish in 1999 season.\n\nThey went on to surprise everyone with a respectable 10th-place result in their inaugural Bundesliga season and also famously played the spoiler's role in deciding who would win the championship that year. Their first Bundesliga win came in just their second match of the season, with a 2–0 victory over MSV Duisburg at home. While struggling in away matches, Unterhaching remained undefeated at home in nine games before losing 0–2 to their stronger neighbours, Bayern Munich. Prior to this loss, they had earned wins at home in matches against highly favoured teams like VfB Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund, beating them 2–0 and 1–0 respectively. They earned their first away win in the Bundesliga by beating VfB Stuttgart 2–0 once again.\n\nOn the final matchday of the season, visiting Bayer Leverkusen needed only a draw in Unterhaching to secure their first national title, but instead went down to defeat to the determined home side. Things took a sinister turn for Leverkusen when Michael Ballack scored an own goal that put home side ahead in the 20th minute. Their title hopes ended when Haching midfielder Markus Oberleitner made the score 2–0 in the 72nd minute. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich beat Werder Bremen 3–1 at home and were able to overtake Leverkusen on goal difference to snatch away the title. With a 10th-place result, Unterhaching finished ahead of long-established sides Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04. They ended the season with the league's fifth best home record with 10 wins and 5 draws in 17 matches having lost only to Bayern Munich and 1. FC Kaiserslautern.\n\nGoalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel, defenders Alexander Strehmel and Jochen Seitz, midfielders Markus Oberleitner and André Breitenreiter and striker Altin Rraklli were among the most memorable players of a team that impressed by its discipline. Breitenreiter and Rraklli scored 13 Bundesliga goals between them that season.\n\nHowever, the start of the 2000–01 season was a nightmare for Unterhaching as they would win only one and draw two of their first eight matches. While the team went undefeated in its next six matches, they were unable to maintain that form and at the mid-season break were only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. The second half of the season was just as dismal, and although they earned wins over local rivals Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, their campaign would end with a 16th-place result and relegation.\n\nAs the season drew to a close Unterhaching was once again in a position to help Bayern Munich win another title. Needing only to hold second-place Schalke 04 to a draw in their final match to ensure Bayern's win, Unterhaching held 2–0 and 3–2 advantages before finally succumbing 3–5 to Schalke. Bayern then had to make their own way to the championship with at least a draw against Hamburger SV which they only narrowly managed on a Patrik Andersson equalizer (1–1) deep into stoppage time.\n\nIronically, in the middle of their poor season, SpVgg Unterhaching would emerge as winners of the last ever DFB-Hallenpokal, an indoor football tournament staged during the winter break of the Bundesliga season from 1987 to 2001.\n\nThe club's struggles continued after their relegation to the 2. Bundesliga. Needing an away win in their final match of the season in order to avoid being sent down to the Regionalliga Süd (III), they instead went down to a 0–3 defeat to Karlsruher SC and finished in 15th place. They re-bounded the following season, taking the Regionalliga title, and making their way back to second division competition. Subsequently, Haching has delivered poor results in the 2. Bundesliga, narrowly avoiding being relegated again in both 2004 and 2006 before finally dropping into the Regionalliga in 2007, finishing 16th in the table due to FC Carl Zeiss Jena's 2–1 win against FC Augsburg.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, the club was never really in contention for a 2. Bundesliga return but did qualify for the new 3. Liga. In its first season in the new, nationwide 3. Liga, the club was close to promotion, but a loss 3–4-loss against Carl Zeiss Jena on the 37th matchday earned them a fall from second to fourth place, and a prolonged stay in the third league.\n\nIn 2009–10 the club started well, but went down the table during winter. 2008–09's successful coach Ralph Hasenhüttl got replaced by the 1990-world champion Klaus Augenthaler, who led the team to a finish on a secure 11th place.\n\nThe club finished one place above the relegation zone in the 3. Liga in 2013–14, coming 17th but was relegated to the tier four Regionalliga Bayern at the end of the 2014–15 season. It qualified for the 2015–16 DFB-Pokal where it knocked-out FC Ingolstadt 04 and RB Leipzig before losing to Bayer Leverkusen in the third round.\n\nThe club's honours:\n\n\n\nRecent managers of the club:\nThe recent season-by-season performance of the club:\n\n\nSpVgg Unterhaching II (or \"SpVgg Unterhaching Amateure\") belong to the Bayernliga since 2001, coming ninth in the 2007–08 season of this league. Due to a number of clubs in the league not receiving a licence for the Regionalliga, the team gained entry to the Regionalliga Süd for the 2008–09 season. The team returned to the Bayernliga again after being relegated in 2009.\n\nIn March 2015, the club announced that it would withdraw its reserve team at the end of the 2014–15 season after a rule change that allowed 3. Liga Clubs to do so. SpVgg Unterhaching stated financial reasons for this step.\n\nSpVgg Unterhaching's home stadium is the municipal Stadion am Sportpark (capacity 15,053), now known as Alpenbauer Sportpark under a sponsorship arrangement with the club. The club's fan base is local in character, although it has developed a small following as one of Germany's \"Kult\" teams.\n\nUntil 1960, Haching played their home matches at the Jahnstraße football field and moved then to the Grünauer Allee stadium, which has about 4,000 standing places and where they played before the Sportpark stadium opened in April 1992. The Grünauer Allee stadium is now home ground of the club's reserve squad, Haching II, which is currently playing in the fourth-division Oberliga Bayern.\nThe Grünauer Allee stadium is also the home ground of Fortuna Unterhaching, established in 1992 and playing close to the bottom end of the German league system. During winter, Fortuna Unterhaching shares the artificial football pitch owned by SpVgg Unterhaching.\n\nIn 1975, local entrepreneur and club sponsor Anton Schrobenhauser († 1982) founded the bobsleigh department, which he presided over until 1979. The club's bobsledders have since achieved a number of excellent results on the national and international level.\n\nNumerous Olympic medals and world championship titles make Christoph Langen Unterhaching's outstanding bobsledder. His honours include:\n\n"}
{"id": "2068202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068202", "title": "Nick Colgan", "text": "Nick Colgan\n\nNicholas Vincent \"Nick\" Colgan (born 19 September 1973) is an Irish former professional footballer and goalkeeping coach of Wigan Athletic.\n\nAs a player, he was a goalkeeper from 1991 to 2013 and first briefly played for his hometown club Drogheda United between 1991 and 1992 before signing for Premier League side Chelsea. Whilst at Stamford Bridge he often found himself as back-up to the likes of Dmitri Kharine and Frode Grodas and spent time on loan at Crewe Alexandra, Grimsby Town, Millwall, Brentford and Reading. He joined Bournemouth permanently in 1998 where he stayed for a year before a move to Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. Colgan made over 120 appearances in the league between 1999 and 2004 and went on to earn his first full international cap for the Republic of Ireland. In 2004 following a loan spell with Stockport County he joined Barnsley where he played for four years and also helping the club to promotion to the Football League Championship in 2006. In 2008, he joined Ipswich Town as an understudy to Stephen Bywater but left the club a few months later after failing to make an appearance, and with that returned to the Premier League when he joined Sunderland. A year later he returned to Grimsby Town and was the first choice keeper when the club were to lose their Football League following relegation to the Conference. Colgan lost his place in the team the following year and was loaned out to Huddersfield Town before later making the move permanent.\n\nDuring the 2011–12 season Colgan began coaching youngsters back at former club Barnsley as well as continuing to play with Huddersfield. In July 2012 he signed a new contract with Huddersfield to make him the club's academy goalkeeping coach as well as still making himself available as a player.\n\nBorn in Drogheda, County Louth, Colgan began his football career with his hometown club Drogheda United in 1991. He remained at United Park for one season as a professional while he was scouted by overseas clubs. This would eventually see Colgan depart United and move to England.\n\nColgan signed professional terms with Chelsea, who at the time were a founding club of the newly designed FA Premier League in the summer of 1992, although he had appeared in their youth team 6 times in 1990/91, becoming their regular goalkeeper for the following season. The Blues were managed at the time by Ian Porterfield and Colgan was designated as the third choice keeper at Stamford Bridge behind Dmitri Kharine and Kevin Hitchcock. In February 1993, Porterfield was sacked and was replaced by player-manager Glenn Hoddle, who in turn put Colgan up for loan. In September 1993, Colgan was signed by Dario Gradi in a one-month loan spell with Crewe Alexandra, however he failed to make an appearance for the club and soon returned to Stamford Bridge. During the 1994–1995 season joined up with Alan Buckley at Grimsby Town who used him as a deputy keeper to Paul Crichton, but also Colgan went unused at Blundell Park during his spell in Humberside. During the 1995–1996 campaign, Colgan joined London city rivals Millwall on a further loan deal but he again failed to make a first team appearance. For the 1996–1997 season, Hoddle was replaced by Ruud Gullit who handed Colgan his first team professional debut playing in a 3–2 away defeat at the hands of West Ham United on 12 March 1997. Colgan had filled in for the then current first choice Frode Grodas who sat the game out on the bench. The Chelsea team that day featured the likes of Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli, Dan Petrescu, Dennis Wise and Mark Hughes. That season Chelsea won the 1996-97 FA Cup. Colgan was on the bench in the semi final against Wimbledon but for the match day squad of the final Kevin Hitchcock was on the bench instead of Colgan. The West Hame game would be his only taste of first team football for Chelsea, however he would go on to make 5 loan appearances each for both Brentford and Reading during the 1997–1998 season. In the summer of 1998, Chelsea now managed by Gianluca Vialli released Colgan from the club.\n\nIn July 1998, fresh from his release from Chelsea, Colgan signed on a free transfer for Bournemouth. Colgan would make not one single appearance for the club during his only season at Dean Court, with him playing second fiddle to Mark Ovendale for the entire season.\n\nDuring the summer of 1999, Colgan signed with Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. His first season at Easter Road he made 31 appearances for the club, and was looked upon as the first choice keeper in a side that boasted Olafur Gottskalksson and John Campbell. He went on to make a total of 147 appearances in all competitions between joining in 1999 and his departure in the summer of 2004. During the 2003–2004 season, Colgan was loaned out, where he spent most of the season with Stockport County. County were under a squad re-shuffle that had seen them use Lee Jones, James Spencer, Boaz Myhill, Anthony Williams and Colgan in the net that season. At the end of the season, Colgan was linked with a permanent move to Stockport but the transfer never materialised.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Colgan signed for Barnsley, where he endured a tough first season only playing in 15 games and ending up on loan to Dundee United for 3 months. The 2005–2006 Barnsley campaign showed a turn of fortune for Colgan as he became the team's first choice keeper. His outstanding displays during the season earned him 20 clean sheets in total as well as the title of Barnsley's Player of the Year and helped the team reach the League One Play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 27 May 2006 where despite a mistake letting Swansea City take the lead, he recovered to make a historic save from Alan Tate in the penalty shoot out which ensured Barnsley won their place back in the Championship. On 4 October 2007 he handed in a transfer request at Barnsley after losing his place to summer arrival Heinz Müller. Manager Simon Davey accepted the request.\n\nHe signed for Ipswich Town on 31 January 2008 as a free agent after settling his contract at Barnsley until the end of the season. He failed to make an appearance for Town, after fellow keeper Stephen Bywater was loaned in from Derby County who kept the goalkeeping shirt for the remainder of the season. Colgan was not offered a new contract at the end of the season and instead started the 2008–09 pre-season by training with Bradford City in the hope of earning a contract with the League Two club. He played his first game in more than 8 months on 16 July 2008 when Bradford City played Farsley Celtic in a pre-season friendly.\n\nOn 24 July 2008, Colgan returned to the Premier League and signed with Sunderland under the tenure of Roy Keane. The idea of Colgan's move was to provide cover for first choice keeper Craig Gordon, as well as competing for a place on the bench with fellow back-up keepers Darren Ward and Marton Fulop. Colgan was named as a substitute on several occasions, but failed to make an appearance for The Black Cats. He was eventually released on 28 May 2009 by Keane's replacement Ricky Sbragia along with six other first team players, notably Dwight Yorke, Rade Prica and David Connolly.\n\nColgan dropped three leagues down and re-signed for his former club Grimsby Town on 13 July 2009. He had previously spent a month on loan with Grimsby 15 years earlier whilst the club were a mid-table team in what is now the Championship, but Grimsby side had since dropped two divisions to League Two. Colgan signed for The Mariners after being recommended to manager Mike Newell by his former boss at Sunderland, Roy Keane. Colgan stepped into a squad with only teenagers as his cover, Leigh Overton and Ed Eley, neither of whom had any competitive outings in the first team.\n\nColgan's second stint at Blundell Park got off to a slow start as an early season injury put him out of action for 6 weeks. Mike Newell replaced Colgan with loan signings Tommy Forecast and Josh Lillis. Colgan made his return from injury on 30 September in a 3–2 defeat against Chesterfield.\n\nOver the Easter weekend period, injuries to both Colgan and his young understudy Overton meant that Mark Oxley was signed on an emergency loan to deputise. Colgan returned to the side for the away victory against Hereford United on 10 April. In what was his final game for the club he was assaulted by one of his own fans when a fan ran onto the pitch to confront him moments after he had conceded the first goal in a 3–0 defeat at Burton Albion that condemned Grimsby to relegation. Colgan activated a clause in his contract which meant he was able to leave the club in the event of relegation. Manager Neil Woods commented that it was up to Colgan if he wished to leave the club. It was also stated that the signing of Rochdale's Kenny Arthur as Grimsby's new first choice keeper could sway Colgan's decision into leaving the club in favour of remaining as Town's back up goalkeeper for the upcoming season.\n\nAfter failing to agree terms with another club during pre-season, Colgan returned to Grimsby for pre-season training. On 15 October 2010, Colgan moved on a month's loan to Football League One side Huddersfield Town, as cover for the injured Alex Smithies and the experienced Ian Bennett. He made no appearances and returned after one month. It was reported on 17 November 2010 it was stated by Grimsby chairman John Fenty that Colgan had no future at the club and on 7 January 2011 Colgan was released from his contract by mutual consent.\n\nOn 21 January 2011, Colgan re-signed for Huddersfield Town on a contract running to the end of the season, mainly as back-up for Ian Bennett, while Alex Smithies is recovering from injury. He finished the 2010–11 season without playing a single league game for The Terriers, but made his debut in a 3–0 victory over Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy. During the 2011–12 season, Colgan remained the club's third choice goalkeeper, making two appearances all season, one in the FA Cup and another in the Football League Trophy. Despite not featuring as a regular in the league he was named as a substitute in the Football League One play-off final victory over Sheffield United at Wembley Stadium. On 29 May 2012 it was announced that Colgan would be appointed as full-time academy goalkeeping coach at Huddersfield for the 2012–13 campaign, but the club would retain his playing registration.\n\nColgan made his Ireland début in March 2002, against Denmark. He went on to make a total of ten appearances for his country, but was selected many more times for the national squad as a backup to the likes of Shay Given and Paddy Kenny.\n\nColgan worked part-time as a goalkeeping coach with Barnsley's academy while playing for Huddersfield Town. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Colgan was appointed to a similar full-time role at Huddersfield Town.\n\nIn July 2014 Colgan made the step up to the club's first team goalkeeping coach, with Ian Bennett replacing him in his previous role with the academy. In June 2017, following Huddersfield's promotion to the Premier League, Colgan was sacked as the club's goalkeeping coach. He was reported to have consulted the Professional Football Coaches Association about possible legal action for wrongful dismissal. In July 2017 he was appointed to the coaching staff at Wigan Athletic.\n\n"}

He was a Maliki who wandered far afield in search of knowledge. Immensely learned, even as a young man, he was famous for his ability to engage in legal argumentation with the religions scholars of his day. As a young man, Abul Hasan was hesitating between living the life of an ascetic in the wilderness in order to give himself up totally to worship and invocation, or to return to the towns and settlements to be in the company of the scholars and the righteous. He studied in Fes and moved to Alexandria in 1244. In Iraq he met the Sufi master al-Wasiti, who advised him that he could find his Spiritual Master (Sheikh) in the country Abul Hasan had travelled from: Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, the great Moroccan spiritual master. Under his guidance, Abul Hasan attained enlightenment and proceeded to spread his knowledge across North Africa, especially in Tunisia and Egypt, where he is buried. He founded his first zawiya in Tunis in 1227. He died in 1258 in Humaithra, Egypt, while he was on his way to the pilgrimage in Mecca. Humaithara is between Marsa Alam and Aswan in Egypt and his shrine there is highly venerated.\nWhen he heard of a saintly man teaching Islamic sciences in the Al-Qarawiyyin university of Fez he hastened to meet him and his life changed. This man was the Sufi and scholar Mohammed ibn Harazem (d. 633/1218), grandson of Abul Hassan Ali ibn Harzihim (d. 559/1144) and student of Abu Salih Mohammed Majiri (d. 631/1216), who had been instrumental in the orientation of Abul Hassan to seek the spiritual Pole of the time (Qutb az-Zaman).\n\nIt was in a hermitage on top of Jabal al-'Alam, near Tétouan, that he met the sheikh who he was searching for and who was to have the greatest influence on his life, Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish (d. 625/1228), known as \"the Pole of the West\", just as Abd al-Qadir Gilani (d. 561/1166) was called \"the Pole of the East\". While he was living with Sheikh Ibn Mashish, on the holy mountain, many wonderful signs from Allah came to Abu'l Hasan, through this holy guide. One such sign was that on the night of his arrival on the mountain he was sleeping at the entrance of the cave where his master lived. He dreamt that he was asking the Sheikh to grant him certain wishes, one of them being that Allah would incline the hearts of His creatures in favour towards him. Then he wished to ask his master if it was necessary for him to live in solitude, or in the desert, in order for him to be in the right station (maqaam) to perform his religious tasks, or whether he should return to the towns and inhabited places to seek out the company of scholars and virtuous people. While he was turning these things in his heart he heard the Sheikh praying fervently and calling out:\nThe next morning, when he greeted his teacher to be, he asked him of his state (\"kayf al-hal\"), to which Ibn Mashish responded, \"I complain unto God about the coolness of contentment and submission (bard al-rida wa al-taslim) just as you complain unto Him about the heat of self-direction and choice (harr al-tadbir wa al-ikhtiyar).\" When he saw the astonishment on his student's face at hearing his words, he added, \"Because I fear that the sweetness of such an existence would make me neglectful of my duty towards Allah.\" Then Abu'l Hasan said, \"This is the Pole of Islam. This is the Sea which overflows.\" He knew then that his master had taken hold of his whole heart, and he was thereby completely illumined.\n\nFour fundamental themes ran through Abd as-Salam teaching of to Abu'l Hasan, as perceived from his famous Hizb, called \"as-Salat al-Mashishiya\":\n\nBefore his departure from Jabal al-Alam, Abd as-Salam foretold his student of his eventual move to Ifriqiya where he will become known by the name of Shadhili and the eminent spiritual station he will eventually inherit from Abd as-Salam himself. Abu'l Hasan relates that in a dream, he saw his master standing near the Divine Throne. When he told him of this dream in the morning, Abd as-Salam replied, \"O Ali, it was not me you saw, it was the station you will inherit from me.\"\n\nThe parting words of advice and admonition that Abd as-Salam gave his disciple before he departed for Tunis emphasised the transformation of consciousness to inward and outward God-centeredness, contentment with God in all states, and the inner withdrawal from creation in prosperity and adversity. These seminal teachings of Abd as-Salam would, through Abu'l Hasan, become the fundamental precepts of the Shadhili Tariqa.\n\nRemaining with his master for a while, Abu'l Hasan then departed for Shadhila, in Tunisia, on orders from his teacher; and from there he received the name of al-Shadhili. He entered a new retreat in a cave on top of Jabal Zaghwan close to Shadhila accompanied by his first companion Abu Yahya Abdellah ibn Samala al-Habibi. After intense spiritual exercises in the Jabal Zaghwan region, he was ordered in a vision to teach Sufism.\n\nAccordingly, he set up his first institution (\"zawiyah\") in Tunis in the year 625/1228, just when the new governor, Abu Zakariyya', also arrived. During his early years in Tunis, Abu'l Hasan first taught forty students who were known as the forty friends (\"al-awliya al-arba'un\"). His new tariqah was a stunning success, drawing masses of people from all walks of life, including the sultan's family.\n\nOn one of his trips to the East, an Ayyubid sultan conferred on him and his descendants, by way of a religious endowment, one of the enormous towers that arose from the walls formerly encompassing the city of Alexandria in Egypt.\n\nAbu'l Hasan remained in Tunis for a number of years until one day God Most High brought him a young man who was to become his successor and the inheritor of his station and his holy line, Abul Abbas al-Mursi (d. 686/1271), from Murcia in Spain.\n\nIn the year 642/1244, the sheikh, once again had a vision. Abu'l Hasan said:\nThus he left Tunisia accompanied by Al-Mursi Abu'l-'Abbas, his brother Abdullah, his servant Abu al-'Azayim as well as other Sufi sheikhs and many of his own disciples, and moved to Alexandria, where he established both his residence and the institution (\"zawiyah\") of his order in the tower the sultan had given him. Alexandria was, during this time, a distinguished city and a place of learning various major sciences.\n\nHe lived with his family on the top floor; another floor was converted into a tremendous mosque where he gave public instruction; and another floor was converted into a great zawiyah for his disciples, with cells for meditational retreat. In Egypt, likewise, his order was greatly successful, drawing into its ranks many court officials, great religious scholars like Izz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam (d. 660/1262) or the Shafi 'i traditionist al-Mundhiri (d. 656/1258), a host of Sufi figures, and individuals from different levels of society. In the year 646/1248, he lost His vision, and it was in that state that he participated in the Battle of Al Mansurah in Egypt, which stopped the Seventh Crusade headed by Saint Louis of France.\n\nShortly before Sheikh Abu'l Hasan started on his last pilgrimage to Mecca, the city of Baghdad fell to the conquering Mongols, thus ending the long reign of the Abbasids there and ushering in a new epoch in the history of Islam. The sheikh was accompanied by a mass of his disciples; but he fell ill in the eastern desert of Egypt, in a place called Humaithara (now: Sheikh Shazly), and there he died in the year 656/1258.\n\nShortly before he died, in 656/1258, Sheikh Abu'l Hasan designated Abu'l Abbas al-Mursi as his successor in the order. After Sheikh Abu'l Hasan's death, Abu'l Abbas al-Mursi moved into the great tower that the founder of the Shadhiliyyah had used as residence, mosque, and zawiyah, and remained there until his death ( 686/1288) some thirty years later, seldom moving out to travel in Egypt.\n\nWhen asked who his spiritual master was, he used to reply, \"I used to be the close follower of Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, but still I am drinking the water of wisdom from five ponds Jibril, Mikhail, Israfil, Izra'il, Rooh.\" Shaykh Abul-Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1288), who succeeded Shaykh ash-Shadhili as the spiritual master of the Order, was asked about the knowledge of his spiritual master and replied, \"He gave me forty sciences. He was an ocean without a shore.\" He taught his close followers to lead a life of contemplation and remembrance of Allah while performing the normal everyday activities of the world. He disliked initiating any would-be follower unless that person already had a profession. His admonition to his close followers was to apply the teachings of Islam in their own lives in the world and to transform their existence.\nShadhili wrote several devotional recitations, prayers and letters, some of which remain today. One of the best known poems is his \"Litany of the Sea\" (hizb al-Bahr).\n\n\n\n"}

The objective of groups such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is not just to help their members stop abusing drugs and alcohol. It is acknowledged in these programs that addiction is more systemic than a \"bad habit\" and is fundamentally caused by self-centeredness. Long term membership in Alcoholics Anonymous has been found to reform pathological narcissism, and those who are sober but retain characteristics associated with addiction are known in AA as dry drunks. The term is used by Alcoholics Anonymous in relation to feelings of anger, depression and resentment.\n\nA dry drunk can be described as a person who refrains from alcohol or drugs, but still has all the unresolved emotional and psychological issues which might have fueled the addiction to begin with. These unresolved issues continue to have a hold on their psyche and hence, they act like \"dry drunks.\" In most cases, alcohol dependency is a substantial factor in the lives of the alcoholics and accepting sobriety comes with its own challenges and understanding of their personality. Despite leaving alcohol and de-addicting themselves, most of their personalities are an embodiment of their drunkard selves. \n\nThe dry drunk is portrayed with feelings of profound depression and frustration and with the indecisive feeling of wanting a drink that they have given up. Several alcoholics drink for about 10-20 years before maintaining sobriety and get used to the personality and character traits that are embodied by their drunkard selves. During this phase of dry drunk, the addicts face restlessness, frustration, anger, impatience and craving. The symptoms of dry drunkenness are irregular and become less intense as the period of sobriety increases. Most of the symptoms of dry drunkenness can be noticed in the initial phase of sobriety.\n\n"}

It was opened on 28 August 1997, replacing its predecessor, the now-demolished Dongjiao Airport. The airport is the only international airport in Henan and serves as a main gateway for the province and the central plain area.\n\nThe airport is operated by Henan Airport Group and is a hub for Cargolux, as well as a focus city for China Southern Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, West Air, Lucky Air, and Donghai Airlines. According to statistics of 2018, it is the 12th-busiest airport by passenger traffic in the People's Republic of China with 27,334,730 passengers, and the 7th busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic nationwide. As of 2018, the airport is the busiest airport in central China in both passenger and cargo traffic.\n\nIts IATA code \"CGO\" is derived from Zhengzhou's former romanization \"Chengchow\".\n\nThe principal airport of Zhengzhou had been Dongjiao Airport (), which was located to the east of downtown Zhengzhou, since 1956. To meet the demand of city development, a plan to build a new airport in Xuedian Township, Xinzheng to replace the old Dongjiao Airport was approved in 1992. The new airport was originally named \"Zhengzhou Xuedian Airport\" () after the township of its location and was later changed to the current name. Construction began in 1993 and the new airport was opened on 28 August 1997 with a terminal of 45,900 square meters and a runway (Runway 12R/30L) of 3,400 m. The designed capacity of the terminal was 3.8 million passengers a year. All the flights of Dongjiao Airport were transferred to the new airport. Dongjiao Airport was later demolished to build the Zhengdong New Area CBD on its site.\n\nIn 2000, the airport was approved by the state council to become the 21st international airport in China.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, the original terminal underwent a major expansion and renovation. The new terminal (current Terminal 1) has an area of 128,000 square meters and was opened on 29 December 2007.\nIn 2013, the state council approved the expansion project of the airport, including a new terminal (Terminal 2), the second runway (Runway 12L/30R) and a ground traffic center (GTC), in alignment with its first airport-based economy zone (Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone). The construction started in 2012, and was finished in 2015. Terminal 2 was opened on 19 December 2015 together with the GTC, and the second runway was opened on 7 January 2016, making the airport the first with two terminals and two runways in central China.\n\nAfter Foxconn Zhengzhou (the main production base for iPhone, located just to the north of the airport) was put into operation in 2010, the cargo transport of the airport has been booming. Between 2010 and 2017, the cargo volume handled by the airport increased from 85,798.1 to 502,714.8 metric tonnes, growing by 34 percent yearly on average, making it the 7th busiest airport in China by cargo traffic.\n\nLong-haul and intercontinental passenger services from the airport also began to emerge in recent years. In late 2015 Emirates announced it would begin service from Dubai to Zhengzhou via Yinchuan from May 2016, as part of the airline's expansion plans in China. This is Zhengzhou's first connection to the Middle East. The service started from 3 May 2016 and stopped from November 2018. On 11 November 2016, Sichuan Airlines launched non-stop flights to Vancouver. It is the first regular non-stop intercontinental passenger service for the airport. Non-stop flight service to Melbourne was opened by Jetstar on 6 December 2017. This is the first air route to Australia from the airport.\n\nThe airport rail link services between Zhengzhou city center and the airport became available after the completion of the ground traffic center in 2015, including the Zhengzhou–Xinzheng Airport intercity railway, which started operations from 31 December 2015 and served as an express link, and Zhengzhou Metro Chengjiao line, which started operations from 12 January 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the airport surpassed Wuhan Tianhe International Airport and Changsha Huanghua International Airport in terms of passenger traffic, making it the busiest airport in central China in both passenger and cargo traffic.\n\nThe current Terminal 1 was opened on 29 December 2007, after the expansion and renovation of the former terminal, which was opened in 1998. It covers an area of and has 14 gates with jet bridges. The roof of Terminal 1 is shaped like waves.\n\nAfter the opening of Terminal 2, it was closed as a future reserve and temporarily transformed into an exhibition hall.\n\nTerminal 2, the only terminal building in operation at present, is located to the northeast of Terminal 1. It was opened on 19 December 2015 with an area of . Terminal 2 has an X-shaped layout with four piers seeing from above, which resembles and implies \"opened arms to embrace the world\". The northwest pier is for international flights and others are for domestic use.\n\nThe ground traffic center was opened together with Terminal 2. It is to the west of Terminal 2 and is connected to the arrival hall of Terminal 2 by three corridors. The GTC has been designed to become a transportation hub for traffic between the airport and cities in central plains region, with an intercity train station and a metro station on the underground floors. Passengers can take taxis, intercity coaches, intercity trains and Zhengzhou Metro trains here.\n\nThe new air-traffic control tower was put into use on 7 January 2016, together with the second runway. The control tower is in height and its shape resembles the Jiahu Gudi (bone flute) discovered in Henan.\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways:\n ( long and wide, opened in 1997)\n\nThe north runway has a Category II Precision Approach. Normally, the north runway (12L/30R) is used for landing while the south runway (12R/30L) is used for taking-off.\n\n\nBoth expressways are connected to the airport via Yingbin Elevated Road.\n\nAirport rail link is served by Zhengzhou–Xinzheng Airport intercity railway and Zhengzhou Metro Chengjiao line.\n\nThe Xinzheng Airport railway station is located in the GTC. The waiting hall and ticket offices are on the B2 floor and platforms are on the B3 floor. Intercity trains to Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou East, Jiaozuo and Songchenglu (Kaifeng) are in operation.\n\nTrains of the Chengjiao Line of the Zhengzhou Metro connects the airport to downtown Zhengzhou using through services via Line 2.\n\nThere are several airport shuttle bus routes to various destinations in Zhengzhou. The bus station is on the 1st floor of Terminal 2.\nThe airport also offers inter-city coach services to and from other cities in the central plain region, including Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Xinxiang, Nanyang, Anyang, Jiaozuo, Pingdingshan, Shangqiu, Zhoukou, Zhumadian, Heze, Changzhi, and Jincheng.

{"id": "2068282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068282", "title": "King Wuling of Zhao", "text": "King Wuling of Zhao\n\nKing Wuling of Zhao (Traditional Chinese: 趙武靈王, Simplified Chinese: 赵武灵王) (died 295 BCE, reigned 325 BCE – 299 BCE) reigned in the State of Zhao during the Warring States period of Chinese history. His reign was famous for one important event: the reforms consisting of \"Wearing the Hu (styled) Attire and Shooting from Horseback (in battle)\" (Simplified Chinese: 胡服骑射, Traditional Chinese: 胡服騎射) He was credited for the implementation of protective outfit during military events and proceedings.\n\nProbably the son of Zhao Suhou (Marquess Su of Zhao, Simplified Chinese: 赵肃侯), King Wuling of Zhao ascended to the throne at 325 BCE, about halfway into the Warring States Period. His reign coincided with the appearance of several other notable figures in the Warring States. He was also the first ruler of Zhao to style himself \"king\" (王), but later reversed the decision. He would later receive the title as part of his posthumous name.\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, the Kingdom of Zhao was constantly harassed by the Donghu, the Linhu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 林胡), the Loufan (Simplified Chinese: 楼烦) and the Beidi, all nomadic animal husbandry tribes. This might have been the inspiration for his later reforms. On another level, Wuling himself had been humbled after a great defeat by Qin. Previously, during 325-323 BC, he, along with the rulers of Han, Wei, Yan and Zhongshan, had declared himself king. However, in 318 BC, Zhao suffered a great defeat in the hands of Qin, causing Wuling to muse that since he did not have the power of a king, he should not use the title. \n\nIn 307 BCE, Wuling started his reforms. Mostly military, they concentrated on making the military more suited to fighting battles. Up to that time, Zhao commanders riding on horseback still wore robes and normal court attire. Wuling ordered all commanders, including the whole court and military, to adopt the Hu style of dress: pants, belt, boots, fur caps and fur clothes. He created a cavalry division in the army and trained them not only in the ways of a cavalry charge, but also in horse archery.\n\nWhile many reformists and officials supported the reforms, seeing it as a way to greatness and power, conservative members of the royal family such as Zhao Wuling's uncle Lord Cheng (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 公子成) disliked it, claiming that there should not be any \"Copying of barbaric clothing and changing of old rules\" (Simplified Chinese: 不该 \"袭远方之服, 变古之教\"). Lord Cheng even went so far as to be absent from court.\n\nWuling did much to check the opposition. He said, \"There is not only one way to rule the world, nor is there any need to copy the old to benefit the country\" (Simplified Chinese: \"理世不必一道, 便国不必法古\") and \"Those who use the old to define the new do not achieve change\" (Simplified Chinese: \"以古制今者, 不达于事之变\"). He wore the \"barbaric\" clothes on court and persuaded others to do the same. He even visited Lord Cheng and gave him a suit of the Hu people's clothing. Finally, Lord Cheng relented, and the controversy stopped.\n\nWuling's reforms greatly improved the fighting capability of the Zhao military. The same year, the Zhao attacked the Hu people's state of Zhongshan and took several cities. In 306 BCE the Zhao military launched expeditions into Wuhu territories in the north. The northern expedition was highly successful: the kings of the Loufan and Linhu surrendered and their territories became administered by a governor of Dai. In the next year, parts of Zhongshan were annexed. In 304 BCE the upper reaches of the Yellow River were invaded and taken from the Hu tribes like the Hezong (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 河宗氏) and the Xiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 休). In the conquered areas King Wuling created two prefectures in 302 BCE - Yunzhong (Simplified Chinese: 云中) and Jiuyuan. In a little over five years Zhao Wuling had expanded his country to the border with the Yan, the upper reaches of the Yellow River and into the north, and had forced two tribal leaders, the Loufan and Linhu kings, to surrender. King Wuling took control of their armies and added them to his military, creating extra divisions made up entirely of indigenous and hardy nomadic warriors.\n\nIn 299 BCE, Zhao Wuling, perhaps tired out from all he had done and wishing to become more involved with military instead of political affairs, abdicated and gave the throne of Zhao to his younger son, Zhao He (Simplified Chinese: 赵何) who was to become King Huiwen of Zhao (Simplified Chinese: 赵惠文王). He called himself the \"Lord Father\" (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 主父), using his new title to visit neighbouring countries, especially the Qin, which he visited secretly. He lived long enough to see the annexation of the Zhongshan by the Zhao in 296 BCE.\n\nIn 295 BCE, Wuling's older son Zhao Zhang (Simplified Chinese: 赵章) rebelled against King Huiwen and lost. He escaped to the palace in Shaqiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 沙丘), where Zhao Wuling took pity on him and kept him in his palace.\n\nPrime Minister Lord Anping (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 安平君), who was Lord Cheng, the uncle of Wuling, and his subordinate Lord Fengyang (Simplified Chinese: 奉阳君), also known as Li Yu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 李兌) laid siege to the palace, allowing no food or water to be provided to the inhabitants inside. In desperation, King Wuling ordered Zhang to be killed, but still the besiegers did not retreat. Thus, after 100 days, King Wuling starved to death. When the siege was finally lifted, King Wuling's body was already rotting and full of worms, a pitiful ending for such a king.\n\n"}

In 1856 the Court of Session was designated as the Exchequer Court, which now carries out its judicial functions.\n\nFollowing the merger of the two courts a Lord Ordinary, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, is designated as the \"Lord Ordinary in Exchequer cases\".\n\nThe date of establishment of an Exchequer Court is unknown because of the loss of ancient records. Originally, Crown revenues were managed by overseers who came to be known as the \"Lords Auditors of the Checker\", later \"King's Compositors\", then \"Lords of Exchequer\". There is evidence that the Lords Auditors of Exchequer were sitting as a court by 1500, but under the jurisdiction of the King's Council. Charles I of Scotland appointed \"Lords Commissioners of Exchequer\" whose authority was both administrative and judicial, and it was during the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell that they became known as the Court of Exchequer.\n\nArticle 16 of the Act of Union 1707 provided:\n\nThe new Court of Exchequer was established by the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1707. It provided that the judges of the Court were to be the Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain and such other persons who might be appointed by royal commission, and who were known as the Chief Baron of Exchequer and Barons of Exchequer. The number of Barons of Exchequer was limited to five. The Court's jurisdiction related to customs and excise and matters of revenue, stamp duty and probate. It appears to have implemented English law in its determinations.\n\nIn 1856 the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court was transferred to the Court of Session by the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1856, which became the Court of Exchequer in Scotland. One of the Lords Ordinary in the Outer House of the Court of Session is to be designated as \"Lord Ordinary in Exchequer Causes;\" this was restated by the Court of Session Act 1988. The 1856 Act stated:\n\nThe Lord Ordinary in Exchequer Cases is designated by order of the Lord President of the Court of Session under powers granted by Schedule 4 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990, which amended previous enactments requiring the appointment to be made by Act of Sederunt.\n\nThe Court's jurisdiction related to customs and excise and matters of revenue, stamp duty and probate.\n\nIn modern times the business of the court consists in the main of appeals on law from the determination of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax on issues of liability to tax. The procedure for exchequer cases is determined by Chapters 41 and 48 of the Rules of the Court of Session.\n\n"}

Armstrong is one of the most successful football managers in the Finnish league, having won five Veikkausliiga championships, two Finnish Cups, and two Manager of the Year awards.\n\nArmstrong was born in Corbridge, Northumberland. He began his football career as an apprentice with Sunderland, making his debut in the Second Division on 4 October 1977 as a substitute in a 1–1 draw at home to Cardiff City. He played regularly at the end of the 1977–78 season, and during the following season spent time on loan to Newport County and Scunthorpe United before being released. He joined Newcastle United, but was promptly loaned out to the Finnish club Oulun Palloseura (OPS). He played with OPS for two years, before moving to Koparit in Kuopio. Subsequently, he played in nine different clubs around Finland, appearing in 179 league matches, scoring 60 goals, and winning three championships (with OPS in 1979 and 1980 and with Kuusysi in 1984).\n\nIn 1993, at the age of 35, he retired from playing professional football and started out as the manager of his then club Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS). For the 1995 season, he moved to Seinäjoki and took the local club, TP-Seinäjoki into the Veikkausliiga. In 1997, he was offered a post at FC Haka, which he accepted, getting the club promoted from the second tier and winning three league championships in a row with the Valkeakoski team. He received the Manager of the Year award in 2000, after Haka's second subsequent title.\n\nIn late 2001, he was signed by HJK, propelling the team to a league championship in 2002 and a league and cup double in 2003.

Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it.\n\nVideo games frequently feature fictional plants as items that can be collected by the player, or occasionally appear as non-player characters. \n\n\nThe Black Mercy is an extraterrestrial hallucinogenic plant used a weapon by the supervillain Mongul. Mongul first uses it in \"For the Man Who Has Everything\", a story by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons that was first published in \"Superman Annual\" #11 (1985) and later adapted into the \"Justice League Unlimited\" episode of the same name and for one episode of \"Supergirl\" called \"For the Girl Who Has Everything\", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian Non (comics). Described in the original story by Mongul as \"something between a plant and an intelligent fungus\", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of symbiosis, and feeds from the victim's \"bio-aura\". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of \"shrugging off\" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.\n\nThe Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like stigma, growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely. Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though Oliver Queen and Hal Jordan are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what \"Hal\" believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.\n\nIn the video game, \"Injustice 2\" Supergirl mentions Black Mercy in pre-battle dialogue with Scarecrow. She states dealing with him is no different than dealing with Black Mercy, causing Scarecrow to ask her what is Black Mercy out of curiosity, causing Supergirl to describe it as an evil space plant.\n\nCharacters who have experienced the Black Mercy include:\n\n\n\n"}

The division was created in 1900 and was one of the original 65 divisions contested at the first federal election. It is named for the locality of Parramatta. The name Parramatta has been sourced to an Aboriginal word for the area. The Darug people had lived in the area for many generations, and regarded the area as a food bowl, rich in food from the river and forests. They called the area Baramada or Burramatta ('Parramatta') which means \"the place where the eels lie down\".\n\nThe division is based in the western suburbs of Sydney. Besides Parramatta, it includes Camellia, Clyde, Constitution Hill, Dundas Valley, Granville, Harris Park, Holroyd, Mays Hill, North Parramatta, Oatlands, Rosehill, Rydalmere, Telopea, Wentworthville, Westmead; and parts of Carlingford, Dundas, Ermington, Guildford, Merrylands, North Rocks, Northmead, Old Toongabbie, Pendle Hill, South Granville, South Wentworthville, and Toongabbie.\n\nThe current Member for the Division of Parramatta, since the 2004 federal election, is Julie Owens, a member of the Australian Labor Party.\n\nAs originally created, it covered the outer northwestern suburbs of Sydney, though that city's dramatic growth made it an entirely urban seat after World War II. For most of the first seven decades after Federation, it included a large amount of conservative-leaning territory that usually swamped Parramatta itself, which has historically been a working-class area. As a result, the seat was held by the Liberals and their predecessors for all but one term from Federation until 1977.\n\nA redistribution ahead of the 1977 election split Parramatta almost in half. Most of the wealthier eastern half became the comfortably safe Liberal seat of Dundas. Most of the western half, including the bulk of the Parramatta LGA, became the core of a marginal Labor seat that retained the Parramatta name, as per Australian Electoral Commission guidelines that require the names of original Federation electorates to be preserved where possible. However, the reconfigured Parramatta was anchored in traditionally pro-Labor territory in western Sydney. Parramatta's Liberal incumbent, Phillip Ruddock, opted to follow most of his base into Dundas, allowing his 1975 challenger, John Brown to become only the second Labor member ever to win Parramatta.\n\nSince then, it has been located between Labor's traditional heartland of western Sydney and the traditional Liberal stronghold of the North Shore. As a result, whenever the seat is redistributed, a shift of a few kilometres to the west or east can radically alter its political landscape.\n\nMost recently, the 2006 redistribution shifted Parramatta from marginally Labor to \"notionally\" marginally Liberal (as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission). Nevertheless, as was widely expected at the 2007 federal election, the incumbent Labor member, Julie Owens, held the seat ahead of Liberal candidate Colin Robinson, a member of the Electrical Trades Union, with an increased majority.\n\nOwens has subsequently been re-elected at the 2010, 2013, 2016 elections, and 2019. Owens' win in the seat in 2004 marked the first time that the Liberals and their predecessors had won government without also winning Parramatta.\n\nProminent members of Parramatta over the years have included (Sir) Joseph Cook, a former Prime Minister; (Sir) Garfield Barwick and Nigel Bowen, both of whom served as Attorney-General before moving to senior judicial position, Barwick as Chief Justice of the High Court. Ruddock, a former Attorney-General and Immigration Minister also represented the seat (though he was the member for Berowra by then); as did Brown, a former Sports Minister.\n\n"}

It was owned and operated by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The school was founded by wrestler and WCW employee Jody Hamilton, who opened the training center in 1989 in Lovejoy, Georgia. By 1995, the school was moved to Atlanta and became the known as the Power Plant. The school stopped holding open tryouts in December 1999 and closed in March 2001 when WCW's assets were sold to the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE).\n\nWhile the school had several successful trainees—including Bill Goldberg, Kevin Nash and Diamond Dallas Page—it was not a highly regarded training center in the wrestling industry. Wrestler Bret Hart, who was injured by Goldberg during a match, characterized the training at the Power Plant as dangerous to your opponent. Journalist Dave Meltzer wrote in 1999 that the school was \"a total flop\" because of their training emphasis on physical appearance over personality. In 2001, wrestler Molly Holly told \"Live Audio Wrestling\", \"the Power Plant focused on push-ups, running, sit-ups, squats, and people yelling at you.\" Other trainees, including William Regal and Bob Sapp, had positive experiences at the Power Plant.\n\nThe predecesor to the WCW Power Plant was a wrestling school in Lovejoy, Georgia run by former wrestler Jody Hamilton under the direction of World Championship Wrestling. The school opened its doors in 1989 and Hamilton would continue to be employed by WCW until the company's dissolution in 2001. There was no tuition for the school. Hamilton would only train wrestlers who had a large physique or had already been trained in the fundamentals of working a match.\n\nKevin Nash, who trained under Hamilton, described the training facility as \"half of a quonset hut where the other side of the building was carpet remnants\". Nash has said that Hamilton's age limited the maneuvers he could teach, so much of his training focused on ring psychology. Early students of Hamilton include Nash, Jim Steele and Bryant Anderson. In 1991, Hamilton trained wrestler Mike Winner, who would later join the training staff of WCW Power Plant. Mike Graham began training students at Hamilton's school by 1992. He stayed on as a trainer when the school became the WCW Power Plant and worked there until its closure in 2001. Two early students of Graham were Marcus Bagwell and Van Hammer.\n\nWCW sent Hamilton and former wrestler Blackjack Mulligan to scout talent at promotions around the United States. In 1993, the pair went to scout Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) wrestlers and hold tryouts at the Tampa Sportatorium in Tampa, Florida for developmental contacts with WCW.\n\nIn 1993, WCW put on matches for small audiences at the Crystal Chandelier, a country western bar in Kennesaw, Georgia. The events gave students at Hamilton's school the opportunity to get in-ring experience before appearing on WCW television.\n\nThe school relocated near Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.\n\nThe Power Plant was in operation as early as 1995. That year, WCW began charging students $2,500 in tuition. Prior to 1995, WCW covered the cost of training for wrestlers they wanted to develop. A segment for the television show \"Good Morning America\" on ABC was filmed from the Power Plant on June 18, 1995. WCW filed for the service mark for \"Power Plant\" on March 21, 1996. Paul Orndorff began managing the Power Plant in February 1998.\n\nWCW formed a development deal in 1995 with the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), which was based in Memphis, Tennessee. Power Plant trainees, inluding Ron Reis, were sent to Memphis to get in-ring and television experience, as the USWA had a 36 station syndication deal. Reis and fellow trainee Bobby Walker were also allowed to work a match together for the small Georgia based promotion Peach State Wrestling on September 15, 1995. WCW occasionally ran house shows in small Georgia towns to give Power Plant trainees in-ring experience, the first being held in Canton on April 27, 1996 in front of 125 people.\n\nBefore his death in 1999, Tony Rumble was in negotiations to make his promotion, NWA New England, an official developmental territory of the WCW. The following year, WCW signed a developmental deal with Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), which was an independent wrestling promotion based in Cincinnati, Ohio run by Les Thatcher. The deal allowed Power Plant trainees to get in-ring experience at HWA events before appearing for WCW. WCW signed another development deal with NWA Wildside, which an independent promotion based in Cornelia, Georgia owned by Bill Behrens. The deal officially began on November 18, 2000 at a show in Cornelia that included Power Plant trainees Sam Greco, Bob Sapp and Robbie Rage.\n\nWCW briefly assigned some Power Plant trainees (including Sonny Siaki and Kid Romeo) to NWA Nashville in 2000. After a month in Nashville, WCW recalled their trainees to the Power Plant for an evaluation by Keiji Muto, who was scouting talent on behalf of New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Dusty Rhodes' promotion Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling (TCW), which was founded in 2000 and based in Marietta, Georgia, used a number of former WCW wrestlers and Power Plant trainees at their early events. Ray Lloyd, who trained at the Power Plant and was known best as Glacier in WCW, was the first TCW Heavyweight Champion.\n\nPower Plant trainees would often appear on WCW programming as jobbers. They would sometimes feature prominently on the c-show \"WCW Saturday Night\", as was the case with Chuck Palumbo in 2000. According to the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", trainees were required to work security at \"WCW Monday Nitro\" events and train at the Power Plant five days a week. They could sometimes be seen on-camera during Bill Goldberg's entrances.\n\nThe Power Plant was not only used by WCW to train new talent, but it also gave management the ability to bring veteran wrestlers in to rehab while contracts were negotiated. Wrestlers who regularly appeared on WCW programming could go to the Power Plant to test new maneuvers and use the training equipment. The Power Plant was also where wrestlers could go to run through matches they had scheduled for television or pay-per-view. When WCW brought in celebrities to wrestle, they were often sent to the Power Plant for training, as was the case with National Basketball Association players Karl Malone and Dennis Rodman. WCW used the Power Plant to develop their cruiserweight division in 1999.\nIn late 2000, \"Figure Four Weekly\" reported that the contracts of Chuck Palumbo, Allan Funk, Elix Skipper, Reno and Johnny the Bull were effectively voided and they were put back on development deals. WCW also sought to recoup Power Plant tuition from the wrestlers.\n\nThe Power Plant was advertised on \"WCW Monday Nitro\". Once a month, open tryouts were held for applicants between the ages of 18 and 29. If the applicants were suitably impressive, they would earn an invitation to join the school at a cost of $3,000 for six months training. Male applicants had to be at least tall and in weight.\n\nWhile researching professional wrestling for a BBC documentary, journalist Louis Theroux visited the Power Plant. He volunteered to take part in some training in an effort to show some respect for the business, but as he had asked DeWayne Bruce some questions about kayfabe, he was forced into very hard exercise. At one stage, Bruce encouraged the other trainees to call him a cockroach while Theroux was struggling to regain his breath. Theroux was later shown vomiting on camera.\n\nAs part of a racial discrimination lawsuit filed in 2000 against WCW by wrestler Ricky Reeves, former Power Plant trainer Pez Whatley gave a deposition in which he claimed African American trainees had less opportunities within the company as compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Whatley recalled telling African American trainees upon entering the Power Plant that they would have to put in twice the effort as Caucasian trainees to get ahead. According to Whatley, J. J. Dillon prevented the careers of African American trainees from advancing within the company. WCW production staffer Moses Williams also claimed to observe bias against African American trainees.\n\nPower Plant founder Jody Hamilton's alleged racist conduct was cited in the lawsuit as part of the institutional barriers African Americans faced at WCW. Hamilton's former assistant Brenda Smith, retired wrestler Thunderbolt Patterson, trainee Tony Carr and Whatley supplied depositions in which they claim Hamilton held bias against African Americans. Former WCW referee Randy Anderson supplied a deposition in which he alleged Power Plant manager Paul Orndorff \"hated\" African Americans. Anderson, Carr and Sonny Ono (who had a separate racial discrimination lawsuit against WCW) said Orndorff used racial slurs to describe African American wrestlers.\n\nFormer Turner Broadcasting human resources manager Timothy Goodly identified a lack of diversity among WCW wrestlers and brought it to the attention of company president Eric Bischoff, who Goodly said assured him would be addressed by bringing in more minority trainees to the Power Plant. Goodly did not believe that any effort was subsequently made by Bischoff or WCW management to bring in more diverse trainees.\n\nWrestler Harrison Norris, who trained at the Power Plant and wrestled in WCW as Hardbody Harrison, also sued the company for racial discrimination. He alleged he paid the tuition and graduated from the Power Plant, but was not offered a long-term contract with WCW. Instead he was occasionally used as a jobber and worked on the ring crew, the latter Norris said he was not compensated for.\n\nOne of the first instances of the WCW Power Plant being mentioned in a wrestling storyline (known as kayfabe) was by wrestler New Jack, who cut a promo in 1995 during an Extreme Championship Wrestling event in which he claimed The Gangstas were not allowed to train at the WCW Power Plant because they were seen as dangerous by other wrestlers.\n\nDuring the October 13, 1997 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", Diamond Dallas Page cut a promo from the Power Plant.\n\nOn a February 2000 episode of \"WCW WorldWide\", announcer Bobby Heenan left the studio desk to go search for the Power Plant. After asking unidentified members of the production staff for help, Heenan says, \"I need a lot of tight close ups of me. It's not important for me to interview or even see anyone from the Power Plant. But get all the shots of me.\" Heenan is ultimately unsuccessful in his search as the camera operator locks him within a chain link barricade in the studio warehouse. As he's signing off, announcer Tony Schiavone quips, \"What a dummy.\"\n\nThe stable Natural Born Thrillers, which was made up of Power Plant alumni, was created in 2000 and were the kayfabe enforcers of Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff. During a segment on the September 6, 2000 episode of \"WCW Thunder\", the Natural Born Thrillers returned to the Power Plant in a limousine. They preceded to accost trainer Mike Graham and trainee Danny Faquir, culminating in the group beating Graham in one of the training rings. The Natural Born Thrillers then move towards their former trainer Paul Orndorff's office assaulting a trainee along the way. They make entry to the office and huddle around Orndorff, who is standing behind his desk as the group approaches. After a brief argument, Orndorff charges towards them and a melee ensues that spills out of the office where security is alerted, who breaks up the scuffle.\n\nAt Fall Brawl on September 17, 2000, the Natural Born Thrillers faced the Filthy Animals in an elimination tag team match. Paul Orndorff entered the match as a surprise tag partner of the Filthy Animals. While attempting to piledrive Mark Jindrak, Orndorff fell awkwardly and was immobile in the center of the ring. After conferring with referee Charles Robinson, Orndorff was pinned by Sean O'Haire. Neither team won since Robinson stopped the match on account of Orndorff legitimately suffering a neck injury. He would not wrestle another match until March 5, 2017 when he appeared at the Canadian Wrestling's Elite eighth anniversary show as a tag team partner of Omar Amir and Danny Duggan.\n\nOn the September 22, 2000 episode of \"WCW WorldWide\", the Natural Born Thrillers (Reno, Chuck Palumbo and Mike Sanders with Sean O'Haire) defeated a team billed as Power Plant trainees (Steve Sharpe, Robbin Rage and Kevin Northcutt).\n\nTo succeed at the Power Plant, a trainee was required to display an abundance of strength and stamina rather than basic wrestling skills. Trainee Craig Pittman, who previously served in the United States Marine Corps, compared Power Plant training to a military boot camp. Trainees reported to the Power Plant at 9am and began the day with a half-hour of warm-up exercises consisting of squats, push ups and sit ups. They would then get in the ring for three hours of bumps, break for lunch and return for three more hours of bumps, practice matches and test promos.\n\nIn the May 17, 1999 edition of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", Dave Meltzer wrote, \"The Power Plant, for all its hype, has been a total flop. How many stars have come out of the Power Plant? The Giant, who didn't become a star because he was taught to be a skillful performer or a good interview, and Bill Goldberg. They both had an incredible can't miss physical look and, for their respective sizes, exceptional athletic ability which overcame the fact that neither were anything close to complete packages when they were put out in front of the public. [...] Is the answer to find some young tall guys with some genetics and a little athletic ability, gas them to the gills, and push them to the moon? The Power Plant is filled with guys like that, almost all of whom are exposed as stiffs in their rare appearances on \"WCW Saturday Night\".\" Meltzer put his views more bluntly in the September 30, 1999 edition, writing, \"The Power Plant in its current form has clearly been a failure.\"\n\n\"Pro Wrestling Torch\" columnist Bruce Mitchell was critical of the Power Plant in 1999, writing, \"Dump the management of the Power Plant since it’s great at putting out muscleheads who never get over. As a publicity magnet, the Plant has been great, but for making new stars it’s been a failure. Again, check the numbers, in money and new stars, and you’ll get the point.\" Bryan Alvarez of \"Figure Four Weekly\" wrote in 2001 that the Power Plant was \"hardly renowned for turning out world-class workers\".\n\nBret Hart, who was forced to retire when a stiff kick from Power Plant graduate Bill Goldberg tore a muscle in his neck and gave him post-concussion syndrome, blamed the end of his career on the Power Plant training regime, saying \"I don't think it was a priority to protect your opponent.\"\n\nKaz Hayashi, who wrestled in WCW from 1997 to 2001, has a finishing move known as the \"Power Plant\" (a modified over-the-shoulder back-to-belly piledriver), which is named after the training facility.\n\nAfter WWF (now WWE) purchased certain WCW assets in 2001, the Power Plant was shuttered. Former Power Plant lead trainer DeWayne Bruce opened a wrestling school known as the Super Power Plant in Jasper, Georgia, which was operated in conjunction with James Adams' Superior Wrestling promotion. Some of the WCW Power Plant trainers, including Jody Hamilton and Paul Orndorff, joined the WWA4 Pro Wrestling School staff in Atlanta following the WWF purchase. Bruce joined the training staff of WWA4 after his school closed. WWA4 is still in operation today.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of bookings he was receiving as a manager in WCW, Diamond Dallas Page, who was 35 years old at the time, decided to train to become a wrestler at the Power Plant. According to Page, both Dusty Rhodes and Eric Bischoff initially advised against it, but Power Plant manager Jody Hamilton encouraged him to peruse wrestling. Page told Wade Keller of the \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" in 2011, \"I lived at the Power Plant. I was constantly practicing my wrestling because they would not put me on the road. If you don't play guitar all the time, you don't get any good. If you don't get to wrestle all the time, you never get any good.\"\n\nWhen asked about his Power Plant training, wrestler Shark Boy told Bryan Alvarez of \"Figure Four Radio\" in 2005, \"It was tough [...] that was my job, nine to five Monday through Friday was to get up and go in there and get screamed at and take a lot of bumps and run around a lot [...] It was tough, though, though—but [...] I was probably [...] in the best shape of my life. You had to be just to survive there.\"\n\nBob Sapp, who is best known as a kickboxer and mixed martial artist, trained to be a wrestler at the Power Plant shortly before WCW folded. During an interview with Bryan Alvarez of \"Figure Four Radio\", Sapp said WCW provided him with a rental car and hotel room complimentary for 90 days during his training. Sapp reflected positively on his time at the Power Plant, saying, \"I'm in there with Sam Greco, Tank Abbott and other professional wrestlers [...] It was great, they were wonderful men and leaders to look up to.\"\n\nWrestler Elix Skipper claimed that Power Plant trainees were seen as threats to veteran WCW wrestlers, who feared new talent would take their airtime and eventually cause them to lose their job. On the Power Plant itself, Skipper told \"IYH Wrestling\" in 2005, \"I don't know what you guys heard about a tryout, but it's three days of hell [...] The training school—it was designed to break you down. You couldn't pass the first day unless you were physically in shape and then the second two days was [sic] just mentally, because your body already broke down after the first day [...] you have to physically keep pushing yourself to make it. [...] that's Buddy Lee Parker, that's the way he pushed us and years later he explained why [the trainers] did what they did [...] to weed out the people who loved it and didn't love it and to this day I still love wrestling.\"\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Eck of \"The Baltimore Sun\" asked wrestler Daffney about her training at the WCW Power Plant and if it was difficult training under instructor Debrah Miceli. Daffney responded, \"[Miceli] was hard on us because you had girls there who really had no experience and training, like a lot of the Nitro Girls that were professional dancers. It was difficult to train with girls that didn't have much experience, and they were kind of thrown into it — poor things, it was kind of thrown at them all at once, so it was kind of shocking. [...] I don't want to call them a wuss because they went home crying, because it's tough. There have been 400-pound football players that didn't last a day. So those girls tried. But [Miceli] is a tough lady and she was really tough on us because it's a tough business.\"\n\nIn an interview with Dan Lovranski of \"Live Audio Wrestling\" in 2001, Molly Holly said of her training, \"Dean Malenko’s school focused on wrestling while the Power Plant focused on push-ups, running, sit-ups, squats, and people yelling at you.\" Wrestler Shane Helms, who was briefly assigned to the Power Plant, claimed trainers told more senior trainees to be rough with new try-outs. Wrestler William Regal, who trained at the Power Plant in 1999, praised the school in his autobiography, \"Walking a Golden Mile\".\n\n\nThis list includes trainees of Jody Hamilton's school in the early 1990s, which was the predecessor to the WCW Power Plant\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term covers a variety of sects, not centrally organized and may not be connected to a specific tariqat. One was founded by Qalandar Yusuf al-Andalusi of Andalusia, Spain. They were mostly in Iran, Central Asia, India and Pakistan. \n\nStarting in the early 12th century, the movement gained popularity in Greater Khorasan and neighbouring regions, including South Asia. The first references are found in the 11th-century prose text \"Qalandarname\" (The Tale of the Kalandar) attributed to Ansarī Harawī. The term \"Qalandariyyat\" (the Qalandar condition) appears to be first applied by Sanai Ghaznavi (died 1131) in seminal poetic works where diverse practices are described. Particular to the qalandar genre of poetry are terms that refer to gambling, games, intoxicants and Nazar ila'l-murd, themes commonly referred to as \"kufriyyat\" or \"kharabat\". The genre was further developed by poets such as Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi and Farid al-Din Attar.\n\nThe Qalandariyya are an unorthodox tariqa of Sufi dervishes that originated in medieval al-Andalus as an answer to the state sponsored Zahirism of the Almohad Caliphate. From there they quickly spread into North Africa, the Mashriq, Greater Iran, Central Asia and Pakistan \n\nThe Qalandariya may have arisen from the earlier Malamatiyya and exhibited some Buddhist and Hindu influences in South Asia. The Malamatiya condemned the use of drugs and dressed only in blankets or in hip-length hairshirts.\n\nThe writings of \"qalandars\" were not a mere celebration of libertinism, but antinomial practices of affirmation from negative action. The order was often viewed suspiciously by authorities.\n\nThe term remains in popular culture. Sufi qawwali singers the Sabri brothers and international Qawwali star Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan favoured the chant \"dam a dam masta qalandar\" (with every breath ecstatic Qalandar!), and a similar refrain appeared in a hit song from Runa Laila from movie Ek Se Badhkar Ek that became a dancefloor crossover hit in the 1970s.\n\nIn Pakistan and North India, descendants of Qalandariyah faqirs now form a distinct community, known as the Qalandar biradari.\n\nSongs honoring famous qalandars are called \"qalandri dhamaal\" in Pakistan. Dhamaal are a popular South Asian musical subgenre about Sufi saints such as Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. These songs typically incorporate qawwali styles as well as different local folk styles, such as bhangra and intense naqareh or dhol drumming.\n\n\n"}

He became a medical man, visited Switzerland for the first time in 1790, and became so enamoured of it that he spent three years exploring the country and collecting all kinds of information relating to it. The result was the publication (Zürich, 1793) of his \"Anleitung, auf die nützlichste und genussvollste Art in der Schweitz zu reisen\" (2 vols), in which he gave a complete account of the country, the General Information sections being followed by an alphabetically arranged list of places, with descriptions. It at once superseded all other works of the kind, and was the best Swiss guidebook until the appearance of Murray (1838).\n\nIt was particularly strong on the geological and historical sides. The second (1804–1805) and third (1809–1810) editions filled four volumes, but the following (the 8th appeared in 1843) were in a single volume. The work was translated into French in 1795 (many later editions) and into English (by 1818).\n\nEbel also published a work (2 vols, Leipzig, 1798 1802) entitled \"Schilderungen der Gebirgsvölker der Schweiz\", which deals mainly with the pastoral cantons of Glarus and Appenzell. In 1801 he was naturalized a Swiss citizen, and settled down in Zürich. In 1808 he issued his chief geological work, \"Über den Bau der Erde im Alpengebirge\" (Zürich, 2 vols). He took an active share in promoting all that could make his adopted country better known, e.g. Heinrich Keller's map (1813), the building of a hotel on the Rigi (1816), and the preparation of a panorama from that point (1823). From 1810 onwards he lived at Zürich, with the family of his friend, Conrad Escher von der Linth (1767–1823), a celebrated engineer.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLong before the Spanish colonizers landed on the Philippine shores, there were already natives living in this place. These people live in huts built on the hillsides located at the northern and eastern parts of the valley. This was so because the present valley was then the course of the Bakun River. For many years, the natives lived simply but peacefully. Such peaceful life did not last forever for it was soon disturbed by an unusual and fearful occurrence in the people’s environment. It all started with the continuous heavy downpour or “LEMLEM” in the native dialect. This “lemlem” caused the Bakun River to swell to an extraordinary size and overflow its banks. In the middle part of the river, there was a big “ALICONO” or whirlpool which the people feared so much. Even after the rains ceased, the ‘alicono’ remained; so the people believed it to Kabunian’s (GOD) punishment for their sins. As it was their custom, the people held native feast called “kaniaw”, the “alicono” vanished and the Bakun River changed its course to the foot of the mountains in the southern part leaving a dry level land suited for residential lots and farms. The people moved their homes to the valley and named the place ALILEM after the “ALICONO” and “LEMLEM”.\n\nAccurate and reliable information on the exact date of the founding of the town cannot be secured because there are no complete historical records available. However, basing from its information gathered from the old folks, it could be deduced that the town of Alilem was founded sometime after 1820. What is certainly known only is that the lay-out of the town was done by the Spaniards. During the Spanish occupation, Alilem was noted for being the center of the district government of “commandancia politico-militar” of Amburayan. This commandancia was composed of Alilem, Sigay, Suyo, Tagudin, Sudipen, San Gabriel and Bakun. In 1908, the commandancia of amburayan became a sub-province of the newly created special capital of the sub-province until the Americans transferred the seat to Tagudin.\n\nAlilem is politically subdivided into 9 barangays.\n\n\nIn the , the population of Alilem was people, with a density of .\n\n"}
{"id": "2068410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068410", "title": "Banayoyo", "text": "Banayoyo\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSettlements in the municipality are mostly established along the roads and in the areas near the people’s sources of livelihood. With limited economic opportunities in the municipality, some residents of the town have also left their town to seek higher education, better employment opportunities, better opportunities for trade and commerce not only to other more developed areas in the country but even abroad.\n\nThe municipality of Banayoyo was originally called “Bacsayan”. How it got its present name could be recounted by the following story: in the eastern part of Poblacion, there was a big tree, which was called “Banayoyo”. The people built a “Dap-ay” under the shady branches of the big tree, where the old folks held their meetings and settled any disputes or criminal acts committed by the barangay folks. After every bountiful harvest, the people gathered around the “Banayoyo” tree and offered their thanksgiving in a festivity called “Kaniaw”, the rituals lasting for three days.\n\nDue to old age, the big “Banayoyo” tree died. The death of the big tree brought famine and drought. The calamity prompted the older folks to gather in the “Dap-ay” and decided to change the name of the community. The people thought of a name so that the big “Banayoyo” tree will always be remembered, and called the place “Banayoyo” instead of “Bacsayan”.\n\nIn its earliest stage, Banayoyo was a “rancheria” (or a pasture land under the Spanish regime). But as more people from the highlands of Abra called “Tinguians” came to settle, it developed into a small community.\n\nBefore Banayoyo became a township, during the 18th century, it was part of the now municicpalities of Candon and Santiago. Reliable sources indicate that lands existing in the southern part of the town, particularly from Barangay Cadanglaan in the south-west to the Barangay Lopez in the Southeast, were registered in the local civil registrar at Candon, while lands in the northern part were also registered in the local civil registrar at Santiago before they were given new declarations by the local civil registrar of Banayoyo. It was only in the year 1907 when Banayoyo gained its township, separating itself from Candon and Santiago. In 1912, it became a Municipality under Ilocos Sur Province.\n\nDuring World War II, Banayoyo was once the seat of ongoing local Philippine Commonwealth Military and Ilocano Guerilla Resistance Outfit, under the command of Army Major Walter M. Cushing, a fearless American fighter. The closeness of the residents to the Guerilla Outfit by way of provisions and financial assistance irked the Japanese Imperial Army, who were then garrisoned at an old Sugar Central in nearby Bucong, a barrio of Candon. Angry patrols of the Japanese Imperial Army burned down some barrios of Banayoyo. Barangay Elefante, which was the bivouac area of the elements of the “M” Company, 121st Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP NL, suffered the worst atrocities. On October 16, 1944, one half of the barrio was burned down and on November 14, 1944 the other half met the same fate. During the same dates, not only Elefante was set on fire but the whole town. The Banayoyo Catholic Church was not spared nor the Municipal Hall.\n\nThe municipality of Banayoyo is one of the 36 municipalities of Ilocos Sur in Region I. It is bounded on the south by the Bucong River, also called “Carayan a Bassit”; on the west by a small canal called “Calip”; on the east by the Cabcaburao Hills, and on the north by Bay-asan Hills. Municipalities abutting the town area are: on the east by Lidlidda; on the south by Candon; on the west by Santiago; and on the north by Burgos.\n\nBanayoyo, which is one of the interior towns of Ilocos Sur, is approximately east of the Manila North Road. It is south of Vigan, the provincial capital city; north-east of Candon; from San Fernando, La Union, the regional capital; from Baguio City; and from Manila.\n\nThe municipality can be reached by jeepneys going to Lidlidda and San Emilio or tricycles from Candon.\n\nBanayoyo is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Banayoyo was people, with a density of .\n\nMany religions have been established in the municipality like Protestantism, Catholicism, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayan, Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many residents have been given elementary and secondary education with the establishment of several elementary schools.\n\nTinguians were the foremost inhabitants of the place, who came down from the highlands of Abra. With the coming of the Spaniards, Americans, Japanese, Chinese and other foreigners and people from nearby provinces of Ilocos Norte, La Union and Mountain Province, the original settlers intermingled with and intermarried with them. At present, however, remnants of the Tinguian tribe still reside in the town.\n\nLike before, farming is the major source of livelihood of the people. During the early period, they used crude methods of farming like plowing by the use of cows and carabaos, and tilling the soil by the hands or sticks. But with the coming of the Westerners who brought with them modern technologies, the farmers of Banayoyo have already adopted semi-mechanized methods of farming like the use of tractors, threshers, commercial fertilizers, etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "2068411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068411", "title": "Bantay", "text": "Bantay\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. It is situated just north-east of Vigan, the provincial capital.\n\nSpanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo first arrived in Ilocos in 1571 and began setting up tribunals that soon became the seat of municipal governance. Augustinian friars followed in 1572 built the convent and house of worship that later became \"Iglesia Parroquial de San Agustín\" (St. Augustine Parish Church). But it was only in 1591 that the parish was recognized or first established, while the town of Bantay was formally founded as a \"pueblo\" in 1593 because it was formerly part of Vigan. It is one of the thirty-four (34) towns of the Province of Ilocos Sur, the legal basis of its creation is the Maura Law of 1893 and, thus, was constituted as a separate political subdivision during the American Regime.\n\nThe early Spanish settlers made the town beautiful by building the 'tribunal', otherwise known as the town hall, the church, bell tower, roads and streets by forced labor. The St. Augustine Church was originally made of bamboo and cogon structure by Bantay residents to house the miraculous Image of Our Lady of Charity, but it was later-on changed into a permanent edifice (built and completed in 1590) because of the good fortune it brought to the people. The Augustinian friars chose St. Augustine de Hippo, the Doctor of Grace, as the Patron Saint and the town fiesta used to be celebrated every 28 August, but because of inclement weather during this month, Most Rev. Alfredo Verzosa (Parish Priest, 1912-1916) caused the transfer of the festivity to May 5 every year.\n\nThe original inhabitants of the town have family names with letter \"P\" taken from the designated listing, as an adopted system of the Spanish rulers in all towns of Ilocos Sur, to easily identify and monitor movement of residents. In a report of Most Reverend Bishop Domingo de Soria on August 15, 1613, the population of Bantay was 4,000 souls while at that time, Vigan has only 2,000. This can be explained by the fact that by then, Bantay parish was very extensive and broad the inclusions of the parishes of Magsingal(separated in 1676), Santo Domingo (separated in 1742), San Ildefonso (separated in 1769), San Vicente (Separated in 1795), Santa Catalina de Baba (separated in 1795) and Santa Catalina de Alexandria (now Santa) within its coverage or \"bisitas\".\n\nOne of the Augustinian friars, Rev. Francisco Lopez, a great Augustinian philologist, with the help of Pedro Bukaneg, the blind genius of the Ilocano tongue who was from this place and author of the epic - \"Biag Ni Lam-ang\", labored hard to translate the \"Bellarmine Cathechism\" originally written by Robert Cardinal Bellarmine. The book was approved at the Bantay Convent in 1616 printed in Malayan Script and Spanish alphabet and was first published in 1621. The Bellarmine Catechism was the first book in Ilocano to be printed and its influence on the morality, culture and language of the entire Ilocos is measurable.\n\nSeveral battles have spillovers in Bantay, one of which was the Ilocos Revolution (Dec. 24, 1762 to May 1763) led by Diego Silang. Here, this heroic figure resolved to kill the bishop-elect Bernardo Ustariz and all Spanish friars imprisoned by him in Bantay. The prisoners prayed fervently to Our Lady of Charity for their deliverance until a Spanish mestizo nicknamed \"Miguel Vicos\" treacherously killed Silang on May 28, 1763, with a pistol at his makeshift fort on a place on a hillside referred to as Calle Encuentro (now Crisologo Street). For the Spaniards, Vicos was their savior and to his honor a commemorative monument was erected in 1763 which became the epitome of the Town Plaza. It is replaced later by a memorial to Diego Silang towards the end of the 19th century.\n\nInspired with the common vision that it will strengthen and improve the totality of local governance, Municipal buildings [Annex I (Legislative Building) and Annex II (Puericulture Building)] were blessed and inaugurated on December 23, 1999, and May 5, 2003, respectively. Considered as major breakthroughs and milestone feats in the History of Bantay, these massive structures were built to 'reinforce' the Old(Main) Building in order to meet the vast administrative demands and service requirements of the publice clientele. Sourced from Provincial and Municipal funds, these expansion edifices are the lasting tributes of the municipal andministrators (1998-2001 and 2001-2004) showcasing local accomplishment and a legacy during their incumbency.\n\nThe Municipality holds the distinction of being the first Local Government Unit in Ilocos Sur to use an Electronic Scoreboard in a sporting event (the first ever to do so in the province was the University of Northern Philippines); the first to open hiking trails; and the first municipality in Ilocos Sur to hold a National Shootfest.\n\nBantay is north of San Fernando City, La Union, the Regional Capital of Ilocos Region, from Metro Manila, and from Vigan City, the provincial capital.\n\nBantay has an average elevation of 100 meters (328.08 feet), with a land area of . It is bounded by Vigan City and the municipalities of Caoayan, San Vicente, Santa Catalina, Santo Domingo, and Magsingal, Ilocos Sur; and San Quintin in the neighboring province of Abra. It is an elevated and hilly municipality but some barangays, especially those near creeks, are being flooded during heavy typhoons.\n\nBantay is politically subdivided into 34 barangays.\n\nBantay's reserved forests and farms make it home to a diverse range of plants, animals, and river creatures. Around more than 60 species can be found in Bantay including over 9 mammal, reptile (including monitor lizards), and amphibian species; 10 bird and fish species; several insects and plants are existing in the farms and wild.\n\nTypical of places all over the Philippines, cattle and water buffalo are domesticated. Herons are often sighted in rice paddies, and beetles (especially the \"aros-aros\" and the \"abal-abal\") and crickets come seasonally. Mudfish, carp, the Abra River eel, and other fish abound in its rivers and creeks, most of which are also seasonal. Monkeys, wild boar, and wild chickens can be seen in the mountains, but not as plentiful as before.\n\nSpanish plum trees (known locally as \"sarguelas\") abound in the municipality, especially in Barangays Paing and Banaoang. Valuable lumber trees such as mahogany and molave abound in its mountains, especially in Caniao. Bamboo also abound in the municipality, especially the \"bayug,\" \"bikal,\" and \"bulo\" (\"buho\") varieties.\n\nIn the , the population of Bantay was people, with a density of .\n\nAbout 94% of the total inhabitants are Christians, while the remaining 6% are Muslims or belong to other major religions/sects like .\n\nIn the total population of Christian Bantayenos, Roman Catholics are 99%. Since it was occupied by Spaniards during the Early Colonial Period.\n\nSince the Ilocano language is the mother tongue of the Ilocanos, most of the Bantayeños especially the Muslims and Indians speak it alongside Tagalog. However, in schools and during Legislative Sessions (by the Sangguniang Bayan), they are required to speak English.\n\n\nFor the 2010-2013 term, Samuel C. Parilla is the elected mayor of the town (since 1988-1998; 2007–present), with Floro Jose P. Peredo, Sr. as the vice mayor. The municipality's Sangguniang Bayan members include William Pre, Roberto Reboroso, William Pacpaco, Ireneo Quintinita, Edilberto Mercurio, Nick Pamuspusan, Arnold Paz, and George Leones. Also in the Sangguniang Bayan are ABC President Gloria Ramirez and Sangguniang Kabataan Federated President Jonalyn Pre.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two major educational institutions in Bantay:\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nDuring pre-Spanish times the port of Pandan was an important trading post for Chinese and inter-island vessels, and one of the commodities once traded there was bamboo. With the arrival of the Spaniards came the project to identify the names of places in the Philippines. Spaniards, patrolling the area for pirates known as \"tirong,\" came to a place near the island called Puro, and asked the name of the place. Thinking that the Spaniards wanted to know the name of the bamboo floating in rafts on the Baggoc River waiting to be traded, they answered \"\"kawayan\".\" The Spaniard then listed the place's name as Caoayan.\n\nFrom that time on, the place's registered name was \"Caoayan\", and has been registered as a barrio of the capital town Bigaan. It became a parish in 1825. The first missionaries that founded Saint Paul College of Ilocos Sur landed in Pandan. A commemorative marker stands at Pandan Port to commemorate the event.\n\nCaoayan, which was once a barrio of Ciudad Fernandina, now Vigan, became a municipality in 1911. Don Dimas Querubin was the town’s founder and got elected as the first municipal mayor. He was succeeded by his son, Don Asterio Q. Querubin I, who served for four terms and became president of the Mayors' League of Ilocos Sur.\n\nCaoayan is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Caoayan was people, with a density of .\n\nDue to its geographical location, fishing has been the main source of livelihood of the inhabitants. Next is agriculture where farmers planted onions, tomatoes, rice and corn bound. The town is also known for its loom-weaving industry which dates back before Spanish regime. Palafox and Associates have declared Caoayan as the fish-bowl and onion basket of Ilocos Sur.\n\nBoat-sailing was one of the major industries of Caoayan but was eased out as means of transportation with the onset of modern highways especially those connecting the Ilocos provinces to Manila and the Cagayan Valley. The provincial government has recognized the Caoayano skill by awarding locals who are engaged in boat-making and calesa-manufacturing as living legends of Ilocos Sur.\n\nCurrently, LGU-Caoayan has launched the country's first ever One-Barangay, One-Product (OBOP) program. Although its official One-Town, One-Product (OTOP) as per DTI's initiatives is Abel Iloko, only 5 out of the 17 barangays are into loom-weaving. Under Mayor Goulart, the OBOP was designed to give all barangays equal economic development opportunity. Under this program, non- Abel Iloko barangays are empowered to adopt their respective OBOPs depending on the raw materials that are indigenous and abundant in their communities.\n\nThe OBOP has now produced a wide array of local products: processed Rosangis (clam shells), Bagoong Ipon, native Cakes and Delicacies, processed peanuts, Pickled Singkamas (turnips), Smoked Tilapia, Corn Husk souvenir items, Water Lily handicrafts, Smoked/De-boned Bangus (milkfish), with others that are following soon. Abel Iloko weavers have also undergone training programs that will enable them to come up with high-end Abel outputs.\n\nCaoayan is also presently riding on the coattails of Vigan, which has been declared as one of the new 7 wonder cities of the world. To be able to get a fair share of the city's tourist influx, Caoayan opened the Pinakbet Farm in Barangay Nansuagao, offering the quintessential Ilokano dish - Pinakbet - as its centerpiece. Currently opened is the Caoayan Choco Surf Point in Barangay Manangat, a resort-type destination that offers surfing and other water-based sports classes, rejuvenating massage and the Black Sand exfoliating rub, and the resto-bar that offers drinks and seafood paella as the chef's choice. These tourism-based projects have been launched to achieve the town's vision of improving all Caoayanos' standard of living through additional revenue and employment generation.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIn the beginning, the place was only a wilderness, a thick forest where peaceful nomadic tribesman roamed and hunted. For fish, which were also abundant, there was a river. On these occasional visits, the hunters noticed the fertile and flatlands that can be tilled and they decided to stay. They were the first settlers.\nAs to how the name of the town evolved, there are interesting legends transmitted through generations.\nSome claimed that during the pre-Hispanic regime, there were also numerous uncivilized warring tribes. \"Kabu Angaw\", a man with a good sense of humor headed one such tribe. In an intertribal rivalry, Kabu Angaw suffered defeat forcing him and his remaining warriors to move southward until they reached the village where the friendly and hospitable nomads settled. Kabu Angaw's natural carefree manners and ability to relate entertaining stories endeared him to the settlers especially the young. His fairness and righteousness earned him respect and esteem, eventually making him as the village chieftain. His leadership became legendary so much that his people were referred to as “ taga Kabu Angaw”. When he died, the villagers deeply mourned on such a great loss.\nOn the other hand, some assert that the village by the river was ruled by a certain \"Aggao\". When the Spaniards arrived, his subjects called him “\"Cabo Aggao\"” meant chief. Finding difficulty in pronouncing the headman's name, the Spaniards contracted it to “ \"Cabugao\"” denoting not only the ruler but also the place he ruled.\nAs time passed, Kabu Angaw or Cabogao was transformed into \"Cabugao\".\n\nCabugao is the second northernmost town of the province of Ilocos Sur. It is from Vigan City, the capital of the province; from Laoag City, the capital of Ilocos Norte; from the San Fernando, La Union, the regional center; and north of Manila. It is accessible to almost all modes of land transportation and a 7–kilometer portion of the MacArthur Highway passes through the town center.\n\nIts total land area is . It is bounded on the north by Sinait; on the south by San Juan; on the east by Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte and the Cordillera Mountain Ranges; and on the west by the South China Sea.\n\nThe Cordillera mountain range borders on the eastern part of the municipality. Hills are located in all the four corners of the municipality. Off the coast of Barangay Sabang there is Salomague Island.\n\nThe Cabugao River is the largest river in the municipality. Two tributaries to the east feed the main channel of the Cabugao River. The headwaters of the north fork of the Cabugao River originate in Sitio Caset in Barangay Maradodon and the southern fork's headwaters originate in Sitio Gaco in Barangay Cacadiran. Cabugao's drinking water supply comes from three water resources in the Cordillera mountain range.\n\nThe barangays that lie along the Cabugao River are flood prone areas during the rainy season. The uncontrollable surges of water erode the properties that line the Cabugao River endangering life and limb. The creek that runs through the poblacion easily clogs up in rain causing portions near it to be inundated.\n\nThe municipality of Cabugao is divided into thirty-three (33) barangays, four (4) in the \"poblacion\" and twenty-nine (29) in the rural areas, further subdivided into ninety-four (94) sitios.\n\nThe climate of Cabugao is characterized by two (2) well-pronounced seasons; dry and wet. Dry season is usually experienced from November to April; while wet (rainy) season starts in May until October. Occasional rainfall also occurs at the onset of the dry season caused by the north-east monsoon passing through the region. The town is naturally shielded from the trade winds by the Cordillera Mountain Ranges. In the middle of May, drift winds from the Pacific Ocean sweep over the area, signaling the imminent wet season. \nTemperature ranges from or a minimum temperature of and a maximum. Average relative humidity is 87.3%.\n\nIn the , the population of Cabugao, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe first data on population of the Municipality of Cabugao was recorded on March 2, 1903, indicating 8,848 residents. This number steadily increased to 35,706 in the 2010 census. The biggest population increase was on December 31, 1918 with 3,754.\n\nThe people of Cabugao are generally religious. A majority of the population is Roman Catholic, while a sizable number practice other religions such as the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Iglesia ni Cristo, various Protestants groups, the Church of Jesus the Latter Day Saints, and Islam.\nPeople are primarily engaged in farming and fishing. Cabugao, with its big \"poblacion\", is one of the most urbanized towns in the province.\nWhile it is true that many natives of the town have gone to greener pastures in other parts of the country and abroad, the number of migrants has been offset by the number of immigrants – Pangasinenses, Bataguenos, Kapampangans and Maranaos who have come for trade and commerce and have stayed here for good.\n\nPeople's organizations and non-government organizations are active in the municipality responding to the needs of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabugao has 26 public elementary schools and private primary schools, 3 public high schools ( Pug-os National High School,Cabugao [Turod] National High School, Lipit National High School, and Sisim National High School), 1 private high school (Cabugao Institute).\n\n\n"}

The municipality was the site of the Battle of Tirad Pass where General Pilar fought to the death against the Americans.\n\nThe town lies among the western hills of the Cordilleras in the interior eastern portion of the province of Ilocos Sur. It is bounded in the north by the town of San Emilio, Quirino in the east, Sigay in the south and Salcedo in the west. Its 7 barangays and sitios are connected by winding foot trails and seasonal rugged roads. The town is likewise endowed with natural scenery and wonders such as the \"payoh\" or rice terraces, pristine waterfalls, and the distinctive peak of Mount Tirad.

March, prepared for an assault of the Filipino forces fortification under the Command of General Gregorio del Pilar. On the narrow trail of Tirad Pass, the Filipino soldiers watched as the enemy began to move up the trail. On around a few hundreds yards above the pass, General Gregorio del Pilar, with his staff and accompanied by two civilians from Sitio Mabatano, spotted the American forces through his spy glass as they were starting to move. But as he watched, he noticed that the American forces broke formation and instead sent a messenger on horse back with a white banner. As the messenger was coming near the fortification of Filipino forces, the sound of a gun was heard and the messenger fell. The American forces divided into three separate groups. One group followed the trail towards the pass.\n\nAnother group ascended the hill facing the Filipino soldiers stationed in the pass. The third group, led by a Filipino from the lowlands named Januario Galut, made their way up unnoticed through the old trail which was hastily barricaded by felled trees a few days before the American forces arrived. This old path lead to the place where General del Pilar stood watching. As the American forces dispersed, the general ordered the two civilians, Tucdaden and Abeng to proceed to the trenches and deliver the breakfast of the Filipino soldiers. All of a sudden continuous gunshots were heard continuously and went unabated for several hours. General del Pilar was shot and killed.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is home to the Lidlidda Protected Landscape, a protected area situated in the municipality's watershed.\n\nIn the year 1800, there lived a group of people called Agsalog (Igorot) in the East Hinterlands of Golot (Mountain Province). Some groups of these people were hospitable, while some were fierce fighters, head hunters, animal rustlers, robbers and the like which worsened the already impoverished state of their place. Tired of such constant inconveniences, the hospitable and peaceful people plotted to leave after holding a secret meeting. They grouped themselves into three: one group to head for the North, another to the South and the third to the West. Being Igorots with customs and traditions firmly instilled by their ancestors, they observed their usual religious rites before starting the journey. A number of chickens were killed and offered to Kabunian (God) and his son Lumawig. It is a peace offering meant to appease the gods in order not to anger them. After the ceremony, a safe and peaceful passage to a wonderful land destined especially for them, is expected. The night after the ceremony was held, the peaceful people started their journey. They moved silently under cover of the tall, thick trees eastward and the shining stars up above served as their guide. The group that traveled to the west were the ones who reached the place, which would be known in the future as \"Lidlidda\". Members of this group had such names as \"Conay, Caoas, Digay, Caoeng, San-E, Gumanab, Anggon, Calugay\" and others. Along the way, they met obstacles and hardships associated with the mountainous terrain and the constant feeling of hunger and tiredness. After twenty days of hiking, they arrived in a place that looked suitable for building homes. It was a valley with grassy plains, a river along its sides, creeks, brooks, and wells. There were plenty of fish, wild animals and game for food. The surrounding hills and mountains abundantly covered with tall trees and bamboo could provide them with shade and fruit. The immediate belief that soon a peaceful, progressive and happy community would be positively established in the said place compelled the travelers to stop their seemingly nomadic existence and settle on the area.\n\nThey made a begnas (fiesta) to express their gratitude to Kabunian because of their successful journey. Within three days after the fiesta, they started digging and pulling the \"ledda\" (Thick tall grasses or ‘\"Talahib\"’ in the Tagalog dialect) to convert the land into rice paddies. Years passed and the population increased. The inhabitants started to search further places for food and dwelling. One time, a group of hunters saw smoke near seashore from atop of the mountains west of the place. Eager to see what was there, they bravely hiked to the place. Suddenly they came to reach a street and houses. The people who inhabited the place were Ilokanos, who were also kind and friendly. An elderly rich man met them and told them of his great desire to visit their place. He said that he wanted to make friends with them as well as barter with their goods. Furthermore, he wishes to teach religion (Christianity) to the tribe. In the process, he will teach them the three R’s of education: Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. The impressionable elderly man’s offer was highly appreciated. The rich man along with his neighbors bundled some clothes, utensils, reading and writing materials and went with the hunters. After a few hours, they reached the top of ‘\"Baggiing Hill\"’ where they rested. The rich man anxiously asked how far more to go. A hunter stood and said, “Sir, our home is located there at the edge of that plain covered with those ‘\"Adu nga Ledda\"’ (many thick tall grasses)”. Then, they hurried down and in a few minutes reached the place. The natives came around and made friends with the strangers. As a show of respect and hospitality, they performed their native dances and songs and offered ricewine along with other delicious and nutritious foods. The rich man and his companions were exhilarated to meet these peaceful people.\n\nBefore departing, he promised the folks that he’d visit them again. His parting words were, “To all of you my beloved brethren, I am pleased and proud to say that, day by day, your living condition will surely improve and prosper because of your rich and fertile soil. Let us therefore name this place “\"Lidlidda\"” in memory of these thick tall grasses (\"Ledda\") whose area in the near future will be converted into ricefields”. This is how Lidlidda got its name.\n\nIn 1890, the sub-province of Bangued, Abra occupied the western part of Ilocos Sur. During that period Governor Ortega, of Filipino race, was the Governor. San Esteban town was in-charge of the Lidlidda locality which automatically means that it was within the control of the Presidente of San Esteban. It did not last long, however, because the people of Lidlidda launched a general campaign to request Governor Ortega to make Lidlidda a township.\n\nThe governor authorized the Presidente of San Esteban town to assist in appointing Mr. Manog Caoas, the choice of the people, as the first Presidente of Lidlidda Township. The barrios of Lidlidda were: Callitong, Patac, Sabangan Pinggan, Bessang, Balugang, Mapanit, Banucal, Bequi-Walin, Camatlioan (San Vicente), Nalasin (Poblacion Norte), Kuwangi (Poblacion Sur), Suysuyan, Carcarabasa, Bugui, Calungbuyan, Labut and Tay-ac. After Caoas’ term (1908–1910) a man named Andan Domaoa became the Second Presidente. Before his term ended, he sanctioned the separation of the barrios of Mapanit, Bessang, Patac, Balugang, Callitong, and Sabangan Pinggan from the township of Lidlidda to be made part of the town of Burgos, Ilocos Sur. He served from 1911-1913. Miguel Segundo became the third head of the town. Upon assuming his office, he immediately worked for the conversion of the township into a full municipality.\nLidlidda is politically subdivided into 11 barangays.\n\n\nIn the , the population of Lidlidda was people, with a density of .\n\nElected officials (2013–2016):\n\nPresidentes\n\nMunicipal Mayors\n\n"}
