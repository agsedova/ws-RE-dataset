Newlands\n\nFrancis Griffith Newlands (August 28, 1846December 24, 1917) was a United States Representative and Senator from Nevada and a member of the Democratic Party. \n\nA supporter of westward expansion, he helped pass the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, which created the Bureau of Reclamation and boosted the agricultural industry by building dams to support irrigation in the arid Western states. An avowed white supremacist, Senator Newlands argued publicly for racial restrictions on immigration and repealing the 15th Amendment.\n\nNewlands also founded the neighborhoods of Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C.; and Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n\nNewlands was born in Natchez, Mississippi, on August 28, 1846, to Jessie and James Newlands, immigrants from Scotland. Sources vary as to whether Newlands was born in 1846 or 1848. Newlands was the fourth of five children. His father, trained as a physician in Edinburgh, died in 1851. Newlands was raised in Illinois and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1867, he went to Yale University. In 1869, he graduated from Columbian College, which is now George Washington University Law School. He was admitted to the bar in 1869. In 1901, he received an honorary M.A. degree.\n\nIn 1870, Newlands moved to San Francisco, California. He married Clara Adelaide Sharon, the daughter of future Nevada senator William Sharon, in 1874. They had three daughters. Newlands helped William Sharon to reopen the Bank of California, and supervised the management of the Palace Hotel, San Francisco. When Newlands’ wife died, he inherited the Sharon estate. Newlands married Edith McAllister and moved to Nevada in 1888.\n\nIn the late 1880s, Newlands and his partners began to acquire farmland in northwestern Washington, D.C., and southern Montgomery County, Maryland, in order to develop a residential streetcar suburb for the nation's capital. On June 23, 1888, Newlands chartered the Rock Creek Railway for a single-track streetcar. Two years later, Newlands and his partners purchased more than 1,700 acres and formed the Chevy Chase Land Company. Between 1890 and 1892, the Land Company built two bridges, constructed five miles of road, and laid streetcar tracks along the road. The Rock Creek Railway opened in 1892. To supply the electricity to the streetcars, the company dammed Coquelin Run, a small tributary of Rock Creek, just east of Connecticut Avenue; the resulting Chevy Chase Lake supplied water for an electric generating plant. From 1894 to 1936, the Land Company operated an amusement park on the lake as a means to draw prospective buyers to the development and to keep the streetcars supplied with evening and weekend passengers.\n\nNewlands created the Chevy Chase Springs Hotel (later the Chevy Chase School for Girls, now the 4-H Youth Conference Center). Newlands ensured the community included schools, churches, country clubs, tree-lined streets, a water supply and a sewage system. Groceries and daily purchases were brought from Washington, D.C., on the railway at no charge to residents.\n\nIn 1893, Newlands began to subdivide the San Francisco property in Burlingame, California, he inherited, beginning with the Burlingame Country Club and five cottages. The following year, he added the Burlingame train station.\n\nNewlands represented Nevada in the United States House of Representatives from 1893 to 1903 as a member of the Silver Party. In 1898, he created the Newlands Resolution, which annexed the Republic of Hawaii, creating a new territory. He supported a greater federal role in conservation and pushed for federal funding of western arid land irrigation projects. He helped pass the Reclamation Act of 1902, also called the Newlands Act, which created what would become the Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nNewlands entered the United States Senate in 1903 as a Democrat. He supported the protection of the National Forests under the United States Forest Service in 1905, and the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. He was a member of the Senate subcommittee that investigated the 1912 sinking of . In 1916, he was the only Democratic senator to vote against the nomination of Louis Brandeis to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nNewlands held white supremacist beliefs and spoke publicly in favor of restricting the rights of African-Americans.\n\nHe served until his death in Washington, D.C., on December 24, 1917. He died of heart failure in his home.\n\nThe Francis Griffith Newlands Memorial Fountain is in Chevy Chase Circle, a federal park that divides D.C. and Maryland. In 2014, a member of the Chevy Chase advisory neighborhood commission proposed a resolution calling for the removal of Newlands’ name from the fountain because of his white supremacist views on race, including his desire to remove the vote for African-Americans. Others believe that Chevy Chase should not alter the monument because the change would belittle Newlands' legislative accomplishments.\n\nNewlands' former mansion in Reno is one of six properties in Nevada designated as a National Historic Landmark. Many notable people, including Barbara Hutton in 1935, stayed at the house while waiting for their divorce paperwork to be finalized by George Thatcher, a local divorce lawyer who purchased the home in 1920.\n\n\n\n"}

Western television series \"Bronco\".\n\nHardin was born in New York City, but reared in Texas, after his family moved to the capital city of Austin when he was six months old. His father, an acoustical engineer, left the family four years later.\n\nAs a growing boy, his grandmother, with whom he lived part of the time after his parents divorced, nicknamed him \"Ty\" because he was as active as a \"Texas typhoon\". Hardin graduated in 1949 from Lamar High School in Houston. A football scholarship enabled him to attend Blinn College in Brenham, Texas for one year, and then he went to the Dallas Bible Institute for one semester.\n\nHe served in the United States Army during the Korean War. He was commissioned after attending Officer Candidate School in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and he became a pilot of Forward Observer O-1 Bird Dog liaison aircraft. He attained the rank of first lieutenant. After his return from service, he began taking courses at Texas A&M University in College Station on a scholarship under Coach Bear Bryant, for whom he played tight end.\n\nA Paramount Pictures talent scout discovered Hardin while Hardin attended a costume party. He had rented revolvers from a motion picture costume rental company.\n\nBy 1957, Hardin acquired the services of agent Henry Willson and made his way to Hollywood, where he was put under contract by Paramount Pictures.\n\nInitially billed as \"Ty Hungerford\", he made various minor appearances in several Paramount films, such as \"The Space Children\" (1958), \"As Young as We Are\" (1958) \"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\" (1958), \"The Buccaneer\" (1958) and \"Last Train from Gun Hill\" (1959).\n\nHardin tried to obtain a support role in the 1959 film \"Rio Bravo\" that had been promised to singer Ricky Nelson. John Wayne reportedly saw Hardin while visiting a film set at Paramount and was impressed with Hardin's appearance. Wayne introduced him to Howard Hawks and William T. Orr at Warner Bros. Television; they bargained for his seven-year contract and he moved to Warner Bros., who changed his stage surname to \"Hardin\", reminiscent of the Texas gunfighter John Wesley Hardin.\n\nHe attended actors' school at Warner Bros. and landed small parts in various Warner productions.\n\nWhen Clint Walker walked out on his ABC series \"Cheyenne\" in 1958 during a contract dispute with Warner Bros., Hardin got his big break. Warner bought out Hardin's contract from Paramount Studios and installed him into \"Cheyenne\" for the remainder of the season, as the country cousin \"Bronco Layne\".\n\nWalker and Warner Bros. came to terms after the season ended, but Hardin had made such a big hit on the show that Jack L. Warner gave him his own series, \"Bronco\", under the Cheyenne title. \"Bronco\" alternated weeks with \"Sugarfoot\", starring Will Hutchins, and \"Cheyenne\" for four years. The series ran from 1958 to 1962.\n\nHardin guest starred on other Warners shows such as \"Maverick\" and \"77 Sunset Strip\".\n\nWarners cast Hardin in some films such as \"Merrill's Marauders\" (1962), where he was second billed to Jeff Chandler; \"The Chapman Report\" (1962); the spring break film \"Palm Springs Weekend\" (1963); \"PT 109\"; and \"Wall of Noise\" (1963).\n\nWhen his contract expired, Hardin did \"Guys and Dolls\" in stock. He then left Hollywood to seek opportunity overseas as his series aired all over the world. Like many other American actors, Hardin traveled to Europe, where he made several spaghetti Westerns, including \"Man of the Cursed Valley\" (1964).\n\nHe appeared in the war film \"Battle of the Bulge\" (1965) shot in Spain, and the Western \"Savage Pampas\" (1966). He had the lead in \"Death on the Run\" (1967).\n\nHe was reportedly the first choice to play the starring role in the television series \"Batman\", which went instead to Adam West. Hardin turned down \"Batman\" because of film commitments overseas.\n\nWas offered the lead by \"Sergio Leone\" in \"A Fistful of Dollars\" but turned it down.\n\nHe supported Joan Crawford in \"Berserk!\" (1967) and played Captain Reno in \"Custer of the West\" (1967) shot in Spain. He had the lead in \"Ragan\" (1968) and \"One Step to Hell\" (1968).\n\nHardin starred in the 1968–1969 Australian television series \"Riptide\", in which he played an American running a charter boat company along the eastern seaboard of Australia.\n\nHe returned to Europe to star in \"The Last Rampage\" (1970), \"Quel maledetto giorno della resa dei conti\" (1971), and \"Drummer of Vengeance\" (1971). He was in a 1970 German television series called \"On the Trail of Johnny Hilling, Boor and Billy\", shown in the former West Germany.\n\nHadin was in \"The Last Rebel\" (1971) \"Acquasanta Joe\" (1971), and \"You're Jinxed, Friend You've Met Sacramento\" (1972) and a small role in \"Avanti!\" (1972).\n\nIn 1974 he was arrested in Spain for drug trafficking and spent time in prison.\n\nHardin's later appearances included \"\" (1977), \"Fire\" (1977), and \"Image of the Beast\" (1980) as well as episodes of TV shows such as \"The Love Boat\".\n\nHe was in \"The Zoo Gang\" (1985) and \"Red River\" (1988) and had a late lead in \"Born Killer\" (1989).\n\nHardin could be seen in \"Bad Jim\" (1992), and \"Rescue Me\" (1992).\n\nIn 1958, Hardin had his name changed legally from Orison Whipple Hungerford Jr. to Ty Hardin. He ascribed the change to a matter of convenience.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1966, he was married to the 1961 Miss Universe, German beauty queen Marlene Schmidt, who later worked in the movie industry; they had one daughter. At the time of his death, Hardin lived with his eighth wife, Caroline, in Huntington Beach, California.\n\nHardin died on August 3, 2017, aged 87.\n\nAfter difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service, Hardin founded an anti-tax movement in Prescott, Arizona. In 1982, the movement became known as the Arizona Patriots. The anti-Semitic group first gained public notice by its efforts to clog the Arizona court system with nuisance lawsuits in the 1980s, a tactic also employed by the violence-prone Posse Comitatus. The Patriots evolved from its anti-tax origins into a group described by the government and militia tracking groups as anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant and anti-black with a record of stockpiling weapons and threatening to assassinate Arizona state officials. It eventually disappeared after being infiltrated by the FBI, and federal agents raided one of its camps in 1986. Three men (James Ellison, Kerrey Noble and William Thomas) were sentenced to prison, others to lesser sentences, and one remains a fugitive. Hardin eventually left Arizona for California.\n\n"}

Over the following hours and days there were several security alerts throughout the United Kingdom, and in some foreign cities. London largely returned to normality in the following days, though with several further security alerts and a reduced service on the Underground.\n\n\n\n\nThe first indication of the attacks came at 9:15 a.m., when Sky News, during its \"Sunrise\" breakfast show, flashed a report of an explosion at Liverpool Street Station in the City of London. The main UK TV networks (BBC One and ITV) dropped programming and carried news solidly within 30 minutes of the first reports. Initially, the BBC's response was slow. At 9:20 a.m., a graphic appeared on BBC News 24 reporting an explosion in the City of London, only for it to be removed and go unmentioned by the channel's presenters for a further five minutes. Around this time, BBC One broke into programming with a short news report, and then returned to regular programming, only to have to return to the news studio several minutes later when the gravity of the incident became clearer. The major television channels' coverage continued throughout the day with simulcasts of the channels' respective rolling news services BBC News 24 and the ITV News Channel. The length of this media coverage in the UK was unprecedented: for example it was the single longest broadcast in ITN's history. There was total blanket coverage on all UK rolling news channels for several days.\n\nRadio stations toned down their programming with extended news and information throughout the day. BBC Radio 4 took rolling news programming from BBC Radio 5 Live during the morning. GCap Media's London music radio stations – Capital Radio, Capital Gold, Choice FM and Xfm – simulcast rolling news coverage from the time the first reports came in. This coverage, aimed at Londoners struggling to get home or to work in the aftermath of the attacks, was much acclaimed within the industry and won the coveted Sony Gold Award.\n\nBBC Radio 4 pulled its scheduled Classic Serial without explanation; it was to have been John Buchan's \"Greenmantle\", about the revolt of Muslims against British interests abroad. ITV cancelled a broadcast of the film \"The X-Files\" at midnight on 9 July, which featured an explosion at a U.S government building caused by a bomb. Another film, \"Stakeout\", was shown instead. The following evening, the terrorism-themed action film \"The Siege\", originally scheduled for a 10:15 p.m. broadcast on ITV1, was replaced by \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". Similarly, in Denmark \"Blown Away\" featuring Tommy Lee Jones as a bomber was replaced on national TV station Danmarks Radio by \"Rain Man\". Five postponed the showing of the \"\" fifth-season finale by a week because it featured a suicide bomber. It was replaced with a repeat from an earlier season. Sky One replaced the advertised episode of their documentary series \"Conspiracies\" on 10 July. The planned episode was due to focus on the Lockerbie bombing. It was replaced with an episode that focused on the Siege of Waco instead. Meanwhile, the network removed references to terrorism when broadcasting an episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\". The episode was taped two days before the attacks. (However, this episode, in which The Undertaker was the subject of a mock attack by two Muslim wrestlers, was shown unedited in the United States, to the chagrin of many viewers and critics.)\n\nBBC Two's topical news quiz \"Mock the Week\" was cancelled – the episode had been the last one of the show's first series and was replaced instead by a clip show showing edited highlights and outtakes from previous episodes in the show's run. Channel 4's comic panel game \"8 out of 10 Cats\" was edited to remove a section of the show in which the panellists discussed which news stories the public had been discussing that week, and that portion remained absent from most of the rest of the series.\n\nBBC Radio 1's programming proceeded as normal throughout the day but with regular reports and updates both from the incumbent DJs and the Newsbeat team generally including listener feedback on the transport situation. Scott Mills at the time usually had an afternoon slot but was standing in that morning for Chris Moyles' Breakfast Show (Moyles was on holiday), with Vernon Kay in turn due to stand in for Mills in the evening. Due to the transport disruption Kay was unable to make it into the studio and Mills (also unable to travel out from the studio) filled in his usual evening slot. He managed to speak to Kay on the phone, who assured listeners that he was OK and just stuck somewhere. Finally due to high listener demand (he claimed) Mills rounded off this show with \"Tubthumping\" by Chumbawamba. The lyrics \"\"I get knocked down, but I get up again, you're never gonna keep me down\"\" were meant to represent the defiant attitude of the tuned-in listeners.\n\nThe bbc.co.uk website recorded an all time bandwidth peak of 11Gbit/s at 12:00 on 7 July. BBC News received some 1 billion total hits on the day of the event (including all images, text and HTML), serving some 5.5 terabytes of data.\n\nPress photographs of a victim of the attacks being assisted by former firefighter Paul Dadge became iconic of the attacks.\n\nR.E.M.'s concert in Hyde Park, scheduled for 9 July, was postponed until 16 July. Queens of the Stone Age were also obliged to call off their 7 July show at Somerset House.\n\nIn \"The Guardian\" Tariq Ali and Robert Fisk in \"The Independent\", echoing earlier comments by George Galloway in parliament, claimed that the Iraq War was the cause of the attacks, though both also ran opinion pages and letters responding that such claims were too oversimplified, and the general mood of the press was that Britain was always a terrorist target and at most the war made Britain a more prominent target.\n\nRichard Littlejohn on 9 July used his column in the \"Daily Mail\" to attack politicians in an article titled \"Hello bombers...and welcome to Londonistan\". Littlejohn attacked Ken Livingstone (\"throughout his career he has given the impression that he has never met a terrorist he doesn't like\") and Cherie Blair (\"will [she] extend to him the same sympathy and understanding that she lavishes on Palestinian suicide bombers\"), while calling for the Human Rights Act to be scrapped and extremist mosques shut down.\n\nThe American Fox News network was criticised for its response to the news. Brian Kilmeade claimed that the attacks worked to the advantage of conservatives, putting terrorism back on the political agenda at a time when the G8 were discussing climate change and poverty. Washington managing editor, Brit Hume, claimed his first response to the news was that it was \"time to buy\", referring to the stock market, and host John Gibson quipped that if the International Olympic Committee \"picked France instead of London to hold the Olympics, it would have been the one time we could look forward to where we didn't worry about terrorism. [Terrorists would] blow up Paris, and who cares?\"\n\nOn 19 July 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke announced in parliament the fast-tracking of a trimmed-down anti-terror bill, for which cross-party support had been secured, to become law by the end of the year. The new law would make criminal 'acts preparatory to terrorism' (possibly to include the accessing of any websites offering knowledge of terror tactics and bomb-making information), seeking or providing terrorist training domestically or overseas, and 'indirect incitement to terrorism'.\n\nThis law became the Terrorism Act 2006, which despite broad cross-party support for many of the new offences legislated, created controversy due to the governments desire to introduce 90-day detention, though this was later reduced to 28 days.\n\nWithin hours of the explosions, several websites were established including You Will Fail, which celebrated Mayor of London Ken Livingstone's and We're Not Afraid, inviting all people to express their resolution not to be 'afraid, intimidated or cowed by the cowardly act of terrorism'. The theme of the latter site was to post a picture of individuals or groups holding a note with the words 'We are not afraid'. While initially intended for Londoners, the site was soon receiving supporting messages worldwide.\n\nOn Sunday 17 July around 1,000 people joined a 'peace' vigil in Russell Square called by the Stop the War Coalition (StWC) and the Muslim Association of Britain. Speaking at the rally the StWC national convenor Lindsey German condemned the bombings but added that “\"The only way to end the bombings is to withdraw from Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine. When we have justice around the world we will have peace as well\"”. The StWC also participated in vigils across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganisations such as the Stop the War Campaign take the view that the fault for the bombings lies with the foreign policy decisions of Tony Blair, and particularly his decision to send troops to Iraq to attack the régime of Saddam Hussein, which he claimed harboured weapons of mass destruction. Journalist John Pilger in a column published in the \"New Statesman\" on 25 July 2005, ascribed blame to Blair, whose decision to support the invasion of Iraq, and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, generated the rage that he claimed precipitated those bombings.\n\n\nTony Blair and Home Secretary Charles Clarke, among other ministers and key officials from government and the emergency services attended a meeting in COBR after the second wave of attacks occurred. Blair also interrupted a meeting with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard to attend a COBR meeting, although he and Howard would later gave a joint news conference in response to the attacks on both the London Underground and Bethnal Green (Howard was also in Washington, D.C., at the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks.)\n\n\n"}

Established in 1856, it is one of the oldest colleges of the University of Mumbai. Alumni include Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Virchand Gandhi, Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozshah Mehta, Nanabhai Haridas, Kashinath Trimbak Telang and Jamsetji Tata and teachers include Dadabhai Naoroji. It has played a key role in the spread of Western education in the Bombay Presidency.\n\n2006 marked the sesquicentennial celebrations of the college (1856–2006). It offers undergraduate level courses in the arts, sciences and commerce and is under the governance of the Maharashtra Government.\n\nBy the 19th century Bombay was a prosperous centre for maritime trade and commerce. In 1824 an English school was set up by the Bombay Native Education Society for Indian students.\n\nIn 1827 a resolution was passed that an institution for promotion of education should be established under Bombay Native Education Society and be designated as \"Elphinstone College\" (distinct from High School). This is after Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, the departing governor of Bombay who was responsible for beginning higher education in the city. Rs.2,29,636.00 was collected by public subscription to fund teaching professorships in the English language and the Arts, Science and Literature of Europe. The professorships were in honour of Mountstaurt Elphinstone. The college was formally constituted in 1835. The classes commenced in 1836, at Town Hall, with the first two professors: Arthur Bedford Orlebar (Natural Philosophy - i.e. Science) and John Harkness (General Literature).\n\nIn 1840, the professors' classes were amalgamated with the Society's High School to form the Elphinstone Native Education Institution. In 1845, the name was shortened to Elphinstone Institution.\n\nElphinstone College became a distinct institution, separated from the high school, on 1 April 1856. This year is officially considered to be the year of the establishment of Elphinstone College.\n\nThe college was affiliated to the University of Bombay in 1860.\n\nIn 1871, Elphinstone College got it own building in Byculla. James Trubshawe, an architect who flourished in the early part of the 19th century, designed the structure, which was built by the engineer, John Adams. This older Elphinstone College building stands opposite the Victoria Memorial Gardens in Byculla, Mumbai. It is now a hospital, and a second Elphinstone College across the Jehangir Art Gallery was built a decade later.\n\nThe University of Bombay was established in 1857. Inception classes were held at Elphinstone College and were subsequently moved to the present Fort campus.\n\nTo formalise legal education, a chair of Jurisprudence, the Perry Professorship, was set up at Elphinstone Institution in 1855. The same year, R. T. Reid (LL. B. Bar-at-Law) was appointed the first Perry Professor of Jurisprudence and the Government Law School as it was then called. This is taken as the inception of the Government Law College Mumbai.\n\nIt was suggested that Elphinstone College premises be used (during morning hours) for initial classes of Jaihind College. The proposal was accepted and admission started for the Arts Faculty in June 1948, with a formal inauguration in September 1948 at the Elphinstone College Library Hall.\n\nThe Sir J. J. School of Arts was founded in 1857 and was instituted to offer drawing classes. Initial classes were held at Elphinstone Institution.\n\nElphinstone College, like many other colleges of Mumbai, constitutes two academic entities: Senior and Junior colleges.\n\nSenior college is affiliated to University of Mumbai and imparts education leading to bachelor's degrees while Junior college is monitored by HSC Board and provides higher secondary education.\n\n\n\n\nThe legacy of the college as a center of excellence was unparalleled in western India. During British rule, it was most coveted among colleges, standing alongside Presidency Colleges of Calcutta and Madras. However, post independence its standards declined and more so in the recent times. This is generally attributed to government negligence and red tapism.\nThe college was an important center of radical left sympathies during the 1970s decade: and produced leaders for this movement.\n\nThe college building, with its Gothic architecture, has been classified as a grade 1 heritage structure. It is one of the most identified buildings of South Mumbai as a symbol British Raj heritage.\n\nLocally, the college is famous for its Romanesque Transitional style building that has been categorized as Grade I Heritage structure.\nThe building was designed by Trubshaw, supervised by Khan Bahadur Muncherjee Murzban, and completed in 1888.\n\nMaharashtrotsav is a National Level Inter College Cultural Festival organized by all the students and faculties of Elphinstone College.\n\nMaharashtrotsav 2011-12 gathered a crowd of more than 75 colleges with nearly 2500 students which was the then a State Level Event. 2012-13 marked a huge progress in its type making it National Level Festival with nearly 5000 students from more than 130 colleges across India.\n\nMaharashtrotsav promises to be a launch pad for new talents who are lost in the shadow of big names. This event shall bring them into the limelight and be a milestone in their path of glamour world. Maharashtrotsav is a budding event planned to cater to all those who intend to prove their talent through their extraordinary skills. It is a phenomenon which brings together untapped talents on one platform with the basic aim and spirit to promote Culture, Harmony and Talent.\n\nTechTsar started back in 2009, with a budget of INR 75,000, which was contributed by advertisements in the Techtsar brochure and banners. Amongst the notable past sponsors are Bank of Maharashtra, Dena Bank, Airtel, etc.\n\nThe name of the festival was inspired by two words: technology [tech] and king [tsar] and was proposed by Elphinstone College alumni Rohan Bhambhani. The motto is \"Merging Talent with Technology.\" The festival consists of many events such C and Java debugging, LAN gaming, quiz, debate, photography, logo designing, grand prix, treasure hunt etc. Students from many colleges across Mumbai, Thane, and Navi Mumbai participate. The festival takes place in the final week of November. Currently in its second year it was even more successful than the previous year with a huge rise in participants.\n\nThe Biotechnology Department organizes the festival known as Primers. It started in 2009. The festival consists of seminars by well-known speakers and continued by events in which the students of colleges of Mumbai and Thane participate.\n\nIn 2010 the students had organized a job fair for all the college students with free entry and are concluding the event with a fashion show.\n\nThe students of F.Y., S.Y., and T.Y. Biotechnology together work very hard for the success of this event.\n\nThe college is located in the Kala Ghoda area of South Mumbai. Several landmarks, business districts and waters of Arabian Sea are at close by.\n\nThe college is easily accessible by train (from Churchgate and CST) and bus.\n\nThe well-known Jehangir Art Gallery is across the street as entrance to the Museum.\n\n\n\n"}

A characteristic of Nematoda is the one-way digestive tract, with a pseudocoelom (body cavity made up of only an ectoderm and endoderm).\n\nThe genus was first recognised in a larval form in 1835. The L1 larvae live in a modified skeletal muscle cell. The adult worms occupy a membrane-bound portion of columnar epithelium, living as intramulticellular parasites of animals, including humans. Infections with this genus have been reported from more than 150 different naturally or experimentally infected hosts. It has been shown to have a worldwide distribution in domestic and/or sylvatic animals.\n\n\"Trichinella\" is the smallest human nematode parasite, yet it is also the largest of all intracellular parasites.\n\nOral ingestion of larvae-contaminated tissue is the usual route of infection, but congenital and mammary transmission can occur in rats.\n\nEight species are currently recognized. Four additional genotypes require adequate description before they can be recognized as valid species.\n\nTwo main clades are recognized in the genus: one group (\"T. britovi\", \"T. murrelli\", \"T. nativa\", \"T. nelsoni\", \"T. spiralis\") that encapsulates in host muscle tissue and a second (\"T. papuae\", \"T. pseudospiralis\", \"T. zimbabwensis\") that does not.\n\nThe nonencapsulated group infects saurians, crocodilians, and other nonavian archosaurs (\"T. papuae\", \"T. zimbabwensis\") and birds (\"T. pseudospiralis\"). The encapsulated group infects synapsid and mammalian hosts. \"T. spiralis\" and \"T. nelsoni\" appear to be basal in the encapsulated group and \"T. murrelli\" and \"T. nativa\" the most recently evolved.\n\n\"Trichinella\" species can infect swine, wild animals (foxes, wolves, bears, skunk, raccoons, rats, and other small mammals), and humans.\n\nIn swine, the prevalence varies from country to country, and regionally. Long-standing meat inspection programs in some European countries have drastically lowered prevalence rates among domestic swine. Domestic swine can be exposed to the parasite by:\n\nIn wild animals, \"Trichinella\" infection rates vary from region to region and seem to increase in colder climates. Foxes, wolves, and bears have the highest infection rates, but small mammals, such as skunks, raccoons, and rats, provide the highest risk to infecting the domestic pig. In horses, natural infections are rare; however, horses from Mexico and Romania have been found to be infected.\n\nHuman infection caused by the domestic pig varies from country to country. While some countries do not report any human infection, other countries in Eastern Europe and Asia report hundreds or thousands of cases annually.\n\nThe United States reported 25 cases per year from 1991 to 1996, with few implicating raw or undercooked pork. Documented sources of human infection have also included game meats, such as wild boar, bear, walrus, fox, and cougar. From 1997 to 2001 meats other than pork were the most common source of infection, with more cases associated with home-raised pork than commercial. The decreased incidence of trichinellosis in the United States has resulted from changes in pork industry management standards and government regulations.\n\nIn Finland, meat inspection revealed a small but worrisome number of swine infections in the early 1980s, peaking in 1996. However, due to the swine industry's modernization process, the number of cases decreased, with the last infected swine diagnosed in 2004. As of 2010 only eight known human infections had been reported in Finland since the 1800s, with the last one more than three decades before.\n\nA study of the sera from 197 wild boars from 25 farms slaughtered in Finland between 2007 and 2008 found four (2.0%) of the sera, originating from three (12.0%) farms, to be \"Trichinella\"-seropositive.\n\nTrichinosis is often diagnosed in humans once the larvae invade the muscle tissue. Some symptoms include fever, myalgia, malaise, and edema. Trichinosis treatment focuses on reducing inflammation, and corticosteroids are usually administered. This treatment often leads to complete recovery, but muscle pain and weakness may persist.\n\nKnowledge on the epidemiology, host range and transmission of \"Trichinella\" species occurring in wildlife in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. However, hypothetical transmission cycles have been proposed for \"Trichinella zimbabwensis\", \"Trichinella\" T8 and \"Trichinella nelsoni\"; these cycles consider the role of Lions and Spotted Hyenas as apex predators.\n\nArtificial digestion is used to detect the presence of encysted trichinella larvae in suspected muscle tissue. The meat sample is dissolved by a digestive solution and the remains are examined for the presence of larvae.\n\nTreatment is by either thiabendazole or mebendazole.\n\n\"Trichinella\" infection can be prevented by cooking pork meat properly, or by freezing pork. However, freezing pork is not an effective method for killing larvae.\n\nOne way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to a safe temperature (at least 145 °F, 63 °C internal temperature as measured by a food thermometer, followed by a three-minute rest for fresh pork). The meat is not safe until cooking is completed.\nTo help prevent \"Trichinella\" infection in animal populations, pigs or wild animals should be prevented from eating uncooked meat, scraps, or carcasses of any animals, including rats, which may be infected with \"Trichinella\", in order to break the oral ingestion cycle of infection.\n"}

The airport is a principal component of the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, a industrial complex. It is owned and operated by the Mobile Airport Authority. Prior to 1969, the airport was part of an active military installation known as Brookley Air Force Base.\n\nAccording to the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2009–2013, it is categorized as a \"general aviation\" facility. This was a change from the 2007–2011 NPIAS Report, when it was categorized as a \"reliever airport\".\n\nThe airport has a control tower and has both a runway and a runway. Various instrument approaches to all runways are available, including an on-site VORTAC and instrument landing system (ILS). The complex is served by a 24-hour fixed-base operator, Signature Flight Services. \n\nStarting in late 2018, the Mobile Airport Authority began renovating an underutilized building partially occupied by Airbus into a low cost carrier passenger airport facility termed \"Terminal 1.\" After its opening on May 1, 2019, Terminal 1 houses two boarding gates and five ticket counters. Frontier Airlines Flight 410 from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was the first scheduled revenue flight, arriving at the facility on May 1. In the summer of 2019, the authority plans to take over the remaining space in the building to completely build out Terminal 1. After this build-out, Terminal 1 will have four gates and additional holding and concession space. The total square footage will be around 50,000 square feet. \n\nTerminal 1 is located at the southern terminus of Michigan Avenue in the Brookley complex, less than 1 mile south of Interstate 10.\n\nFor the 12-month period ending January 31, 2010, the airport had 82,820 aircraft operations, an average of 226 per day: 49% general aviation, 43% military, 5% air taxi, and 3% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 34 aircraft based at this airport: 65% single-engine, 18% multi-engine, 15% jet and 3% helicopter.\n\nIn 2018, the Mobile Airport Authority commissioned a study on whether to move passenger service to Downtown Airport from Mobile Regional Airport and announced ViaAir would start a route to Orlando in the spring. In January 2019, Frontier Airlines announced new service to Denver and Chicago beginning in May 2019. ViaAir announced they were ending most scheduled services network-wide, including at BFM, on May 23, 2019.

{"id": "2190527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190527", "title": "Digitaria exilis", "text": "Digitaria exilis\n\nDigitaria exilis, referred to as findi or fundi in areas of Africa, such as The Gambia, with English common names white fonio, fonio millet, and hungry rice or acha rice, is a grass species. It is the most important of a diverse group of wild and domesticated \"Digitaria\" species known as fonio that are harvested in the savannas of West Africa. The grains are very small. It has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable use of the land. Despite its valuable characteristics and widespread cultivation, fonio has generally received limited attention research and development, which is also why the species is sometimes referred to as an underutilized crop.\n\nThe name (borrowed by English from French) is from Wolof \"foño\".\n\nFonio has continued to be important locally because it is both nutritious and one of the world's fastest growing cereals, reaching maturity in as little as six to eight weeks. It is a crop that can be relied on in semi-arid areas with poor soils, where rains are brief and unreliable. The grains are used in porridge and couscous, for bread, and for beer.\n\nThe small grains make it difficult and time-consuming to remove the husk. Traditional methods include pounding it in a mortar with sand (then separating the grains and sand) or \"popping\" it over a flame and then pounding it (which yields a toasted color grain; this technique is used among the Akposso). The invention of a simple fonio husking machine offers an easier mechanical way to dehusk.\n\nThe genetic diversity of \"Digitaria exilis\" varies from region to region in Africa. For example, not much genetic diversity was detected among the domesticated \"Digitaria exilis\" landraces from Mali. In contrast, large levels of genetic diversity were detected among the domesticated \"Digitaria\" exilis landraces of the Upper Niger River Basin of West Africa. The many different landraces of Digitaria exilis are affected differently by the various processing methods.\n\nThe European Commission with the EU Regulation L 323/1 of December 19 2018 approved the commercialization in Europe of Fonio as Novel Food, upon the scientific dossier managed and submitted by “the applicant” Italian company Obà Food.\nThe fonio is an annual, erect herbaceous plant which reaches stature heights from 30 to 80 centimeters. The ears consist of two to five narrow part ears, which are up to 15 centimeters long. The spikelets comprise a sterile flower and a fertile flower, the latter of which gives rise to the fonio grain. The grain is a caryopsis, which remains surrounded by glumes and husks. Its size is very small, only 1.5 mm (around 2000 seeds to 1 gram). The colour ranges from white, yellow and purple.\nFonio mature faster than all other cereals. Some varieties can already be harvested 42–56 days after sowing. Other ripen more slowly, usually in 165–180 days.\n\nFonio is one of the ancient African crops, possibly the oldest West African crop as its cultivation seems to have started about 7,000 years ago. The first references to Fonio as food are reported from the mid-14th century. \"D. exilis\" was originally derived from the wild species \"D. longiflora\".\n\nSignificant cultivation is in West Africa from Chad to Cape Verde, South Mali, in western Burkina Faso, eastern Senegal, northern Guinea, in north-eastern Nigeria as well as in the south of Niger, where the plant supplies the staple food for several million people. In some regions of Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Nigeria, Fonio is the most important or one of the main cereals. The White Fonio has its main growing region in the highland plateaus of Nigeria, where it is called Acha. The second Fonio-species Iburu or Black Fonio is limited on the Jos-Bauchi Plateau in Nigeria and the northern regions of Togo and Benin.\n\nFonio is grown in parts of the Dominican Republic, where it has already brought in 1500 from West Africa, firstly only grew as a weed, but it is also cultivated again lately.\n\nSource:\n\nMore than 550 000 ha of fonio are grown each year in West Africa and the production runs at 587 000 t. Yields are relatively stable, the yield average is currently 1t/ha. In the peripheral regions the yields are less than 500 kilograms and drop when in very poor soils down to 150 to 200 kilograms.\n\nFonio is cultivated in West Africa under tropical climate, with a pronounced dry season, temperatures between 25-30 °C and annual rainfalls of 600 to 1200 mm. Nevertheless, Fonio is also grown in higher altitude: over 1000 m, with higher annual rainfalls (1200 to 1500 mm) and colder temperatures (15-25°). Fonio has a well developed root system, which can reach more than one meter depth in the soil. This root system explains the good performance of the plant during the dry season and its adaptation to poor and low fertility soils. Fonio is mainly grown on sandy soils, but can also grow on rocky soils. It also thrives on acidic clay soils with a high aluminium content. On heavy soils, most varieties thrive badly. This crop is low demanding and can cope with unfavourable climate and soil conditions.\n\nThe most works are done by hand.\n\nThe main works to do before sowing are the cleaning of the field and ploughing. Sometimes animals are used for ploughing or a \"\" is utilized to do a superficial scratching.\n\nThe sowing time starts with the first rainfalls. This can vary depending on the variety and the geographical area of cultivation. The grains used for sowing are the best grains kept from the precedent harvest and are sown by hand (broadcast seeding). Sometimes the seeds are mixed with sand to have a more homogenous repartition on the soil. The seeds remain on the surface, so successive harrowing by hand or with the daba is needed to bury them slightly in the soil. Normally 30–40 kg/ha of seeds are used, but sometimes more than 70 kg/ha are sown, in order to control weeds at time of emergence. For germination and emergence a temperature of 30 °C is optimal. The germination and growth is rapid, and for the upkeep of the crop only weeding is needed.\n\nHarvesting is mostly still done by hand. As soon as the grains reach maturity, usually during July or August, men cut the fonio with sickles whilst woman and children collect them to sheaves. A facilitation is the use of a motor-driven mower. They have to be stored in a dry and airy space to prevent mould formation. During the dry season the sheaves are piled to big stacks in the sun to dry them completely. Threshing is done as well manually. Tractor-driven threshers are rarely used because of the higher costs and the higher loss of the small grains. The grains are stored loosely in storehouses. Before consumption the spelts have to be removed, they are not digestable. This process is traditionally done by women in mortars. After the fifth decortication the fonio is called \"whitened\". Adhering grit and sand is washed of with the help of gourds. This process demands very skilled woman and up to 10 liters clean water for one kilogram of fonio.\n\nInstead of the labour-intensive manual processing machines could be used. There has been much effort for a long time to obtain efficient machines. The same threshing-machine used for rice could be adapted with some technical modification for fonio. Because of the high cost and performance of such machines they have to be operated by multiple villages to be economically efficient. To clean the threshed seeds winnowing machines or rotational sieves could be used. The CIRAD developed a decortication machine of the GMBF type especially for fonio.\n\n\"Digitaria exilis\" is a crop that has not been pursued for domestication worldwide, but actually has many qualities that make it a good crop candidate. \"Digitaria exilis\" is an annual plant that has a C4 metabolism and is medium in height. It can be planted alone or among other crops in the marginal land. Farmers value how quickly \"Digitaria exilis\" comes to maturation. In as little as six to eight weeks the crop reaches maturity.\n\nThe crop is an important part of cooking in West Africa. \"Digitaria exilis\" is a grain traditionally used for porridges and steamed cooked food. The species is known to have high carbohydrate and protein levels. These protein levels are seen with \"Digitaria exilis\" being rich in essential amino acids like methionine compared to other cereals like wheat, rice, and maize. These qualities show that \"Digitaria exilis\" could be a good source of food and if the right characters are selected for it could turn into a useful crop.\n\n\"Digitaria exilis\" has also good sustainability qualities and can survive in difficult environments. The crop maintained germination rates after being exposed to washing and scarifying treatments. Also \"Digitaria exilis\" germinated well in various soil types like sand and loam. The crop requires little input with surviving just on rain. It is adapted to marginal land doing well in poor soil and being drought resistant. All these characteristics make \"Digitaria exilis\" a possible good crop candidate.\n\n\"Digitaria exilis\" can be harvested in many ways. Some farmers just uproot them to get the seeds, but other methods may be more effective. People use sickles to cut the region with seeds instead of destroying the whole plant. Another process is threshing which can vary by region. One way of threshing is beating the straw to extract the grain or it can be done by trampling the straw to extract the seeds. After the grains must be dried usually for a few days. The crop has very small seeds surrounded by tough kernels so they are ground into a fine powder to be incorporated in cooking.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Digitaria exilis\" does have some implications with regard to its ability to be a crop candidate. One thing the crop struggles with is competing with weeds. So farmers are required to remove weeds after sowing. Another thing is that fields after planted with \"Digitaria exilis\" require time to regain nutrients in the soil. Usually a field must fallow for 1–2 years. These are some qualities that need improvement and through artificial selection can be achieved.\n\n\"Digitaria exilis\" is the oldest native cereal crop in West Africa at around 5 millennia BC. For that region, \"Digitaria exilis\" is vital for food security. Farmers emphasize the crop's cooking ability, growth cycle, productivity, and size. Regardless, the crop is facing difficulties with keeping diversity and production up because of lack of harvest and lack of technologies for processing. With that in mind, it is important to maintain and develop the fonio for producers and consumers. \"Digitaria exilis\" has many potential future uses such as cooking or technological purposes so it is necessary to select for good kernel properties to develop it into a new food source as a crop for the world.\n\n\"Digitaria exilis\" holds high nutritional value to humans.\nThe nutritional value of decorticated fonio is about 1470 kJ and for whitened fonio 1430 kJ per 100 gram.\nThe nutritional value of its product is very high without suffering from taste. Furthermore, it is a good source of fibres and phytonutrients.\n\nIt contains methionine and cysteine, two amino acids that are important to human survival. These two amino acids, however, are lacking in wheat, rice, maize, and other cereal crops. Moving from the amino acid level to the macromolecule level, \"D. exilis,\" compared to other cereal crops, has greater protein, carbohydrate, and fiber content. \"Digitaria exilis\" has more protein and fiber content than rice. Additionally, \"D. exilis\" has more carbohydrate content than millet, sorghum, and maize. Therefore, the nutritional benefit from \"D. exilis\" outweighs the nutritional benefits from other similar cereal crops.\n\nContent of Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins and Minerals of \"Digitaria exilis\" compared to other cereals (% dry weight)\n\nSource:\n\n\"D. exilis\" shows generally mineral contents that are in the range of other cereals (Table 1). But it contains much more sulphur than other cereals and they are also mainly concentrated in the grain and not in the husk.\nMethionine, which is built up with sulphur, is accumulated in fonio twice the amount compared to corn or millet and three times compared to rice. Some of the minerals are mostly concentrated in the husk which are therefore lost while hulling.\nThe remaining fatty acids in the decorticated grain are mainly unsaturated fats like linoleic and oleic acid. The most present saturated fat is palmitic acid. It has been reported that Digitaria exilis is an optimal food for people having diabetic problems.\n\nMineral content of Digitaria exilis, decorticated and whitened\n\nSource:\n\nThere are several factors that can alter this pre-existing high nutritional content. One method that distorts the nutritional composition of \"D. exilis\" is the extensive processing required to bring it to an edible state. During milling, the outer layers of its grains are removed, and these layers are where the nutrients are primarily located. Therefore, with the loss of the outer layers of the grains, there is a loss in the nutrient content. As a result, the iron, zinc, and phytate concentrations present in the edible form of \"D. exilis\" are reduced in abundance relative to their respective concentrations before processing.\n\nCoeliac disease is an intolerance to a certain prolamine, so called gluten in wheat, which can cause chronic small intestinal problems. Fonio is closer to sorghum and rice than to wheat, and therefore it does not contain the sequence of amino acids that cause this intolerance. Fonio is therefore an interesting crop for people suffering from coeliac disease.\n\nAdditionally, the nutrient content and yield of \"D. exilis\" can be affected by the soil nutrition present in the varying climatic conditions of West Africa, which is where \"D. exilis\" primarily grows. Through experimentation, it was seen that the nitrogen concentration in the soil has the greatest effect on the nutrition and productivity of \"D. exilis\". When nitrogen was added to the soil in limited quantities with an excess of potassium and phosphorus, productivity of \"D. exilis\" increased by 22%. Such significant results were not observed, however, when either potassium or phosphorus was added to the soil with excess nitrogen and phosphorus, or with excess nitrogen and potassium, respectively. On the contrary, when nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were added to the soil in equal and moderate quantities, the greatest amount of yield and nutrition was seen. This overall trend is seen as a result of the low rainfall and poor soil conditions that \"D. exilis\" naturally grows in.\n\nAdditionally, farmers evaluated \"D. exilis\" landraces on key agricultural characteristics. These included ease of processing, productivity, grain size, and facility of harvesting among many others. Based on the evaluations given by these farmers, it can be seen that the agronomic traits (traits that allow for a greater ease of growing to farmers) of \"D. exilis\" would be having a big and long stem, having a long panicle with lots of grains, and having a large grain size. These traits allow for easier growing and harvesting by farmers.\n\nFrom an evolutionary biology standpoint, information about the nutritional content of \"D. exilis\", factors that modify its nutritional content, and its agronomically important traits can be of importance under artificial selection of \"D. exilis\". The \"Digitaria exilis\" landraces that exhibit the greatest amount of nutrition and display the agriculturally important qualities can be further cultivated under improvement. As a result, \"Digitaria exilis\" can serve as a perennial crop to provide the human species with food security in the future.\n\nWWF and Knorr in a joint study, dated February 2019, name \"Digitaria exilis\" as one of the “50 future foods for healthier people and a healthier planet\". WWF and the multinational Unilever (Knorr) teamed up to launch a campaign to raise awareness of the 50 Future Foods which people should eat more of in order to help reduce the environmental impact of food productions and to improve human health – \"Digitaria exilis\" has been identified as one of those ingredients.\n\nOne of the things that makes \"Digitaria exilis\" such a sought after grain is its chemical composition. \"Digitaria exilis\" is an important source of nutrition because it is rich in methionine, which is an amino acid that is vital to human health. Since \"Digitaria exilis\" was such an important part of people's nutrition, researchers wanted to find out what made it taste so good. Volatile compounds were used to determine what contributed to the flavor of \"Digitaria exilis\". It was found that \"Digitaria exilis\" contains several amino acids that readily react with monosaccharides to form alkylpyrazines. There were three types of volatiles: those formed from starch degradation, those formed from reactions between starch and proteins, and those formed through lipid oxidation.\n\n One of the things that makes \"Digitaria exilis\" unique is its physicochemical properties. The physicochemical properties of \"Digitaria exilis\" can differ depending on if its starch is natural or succinylated. The pH of succinylated \"Digitaria exilis\" is lower than that of natural \"Digitaria exilis\". This could be because some of the molecules introduced by succinylation resembled those of acetylation. While succinylation does decrease the pH of starch, it can increase some of its properties such as bulk density and water absorption capacity. The difference in bulk density is caused by the particle size decreasing as the bulk density increases. Succinylation increases the water absorption capacity of the starch which indicates that it could be helpful in some food products such as dough.\n\n Compared to starches like \"D. iburua\" and \"Eleusine coracana\", \"Digitaria exilis\" has more branched molecules. This was an important finding because although it has more branched molecules, it has fewer chains than the other starches which is unusual chemically. Aside from these differences, most other chemical characteristics were very similar to rice which was not surprising because \"Digitaria exilis\" and rice are both starches of the A. crystalline type.\nAdditionally, the microstructure of \"Digitaria exilis\" was studied, and it was discovered that it is very similar to the grain millets. Researchers found that \"Digitaria exilis\" is most abundant in protein bodies and that most of the protein is located towards the center of the cell. The specific structure of \"Digitaria exilis\" was analyzed and it was found that it is surrounded by thin bracts and two glumes. The caryopsis, a type of fruit that contains a pericarp that is fused with a thin seed coat, of the \"Digitaria exilis\" contains several layers that serve the purpose of protecting the endosperm and embryonic tissues. \nThe composition of fonio can differ depending on what part of the world you are in. The main differences are in the protein and fiber content. This information could be useful in giving people dietary advice if their diet is lacking a certain protein or fiber.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2190528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190528", "title": "Vexel", "text": "Vexel\n\nVexel is a neologism for an entirely pixel-based form of raster art that imitates the visual appearance of vector graphics technique (i.e. sharp-edged lines and areas of flat colour or smooth gradient fills). The word itself is a portmanteau derived from a combination of \"vector\" and \"pixel.\"\n\nThere is no one defined way to create a vexel, however, one archetypal way to create a vexel follows. Instead of using vector-based lines, shapes, and polygons to create an image, a vexel is typically created using a raster program's support for transparent layers. Each transparent layer is given a solid (or sometimes gradient) shape and a display ordering that when displayed together with other near shape layers appears to create a stepped-but-gradual color transition. In some cases, for more realism, gradients are used that remove the stepping in the color transitions to create a smoother, photo-realistic image.\n\nThe different nature of raster programs over a vector-plotted approach gives some vexel images a unique appearance when compared with traditional rasterized vector graphics. However, the increased flexibility comes with a loss of image scalability for print media, which vector artwork retains. To compensate for this, most vexels are created at very high resolution.\n\nA vexel may even be composed using vector graphic techniques, however it becomes a vexel when the vector elements are rasterized and further manipulations to the image are done in raster. Sometimes true raster images are placed behind and/or in front of the original vector elements to emphasize the surrealism that the vector elements produce. A vexel is not essentially created with paintbrushes, airbrushes or a freehand tool such as pencil, although some may include these elements if they are not the primary medium. Ben Woolley says \"[V]exels were originally meant to involve a vector technique, not any particular aesthetic style.\"\n\nVexels are often characterized by crisp, clean color and lines (that look nearly vector-graphics style) but is entirely pixel-based, with a variety of color levels, from 2-color outlines to pseudo-realism.\n\nThe term vexel was created by Seth Woolley while he was a technical contributor to the now defunct but once popular teen message board Nova Boards to give it a distinctive name from traditional vector graphics. Seth didn't approve of calling the raster images that looked like vectors the name of \"vector\". In response to a question of what they would be called, he coined the term \"vexel\" as a combination of vector and pixel since they were not simply rasters, and those asking needed a name for a new style. He at first suggested calling them rasterized or posterized vector images, but the community took the word \"vexel\" as an acceptable neologism. Ben Woolley has described its derivation.\n"}

{"id": "2190535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190535", "title": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization", "text": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\n\nIn mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is an ionization technique that uses a laser energy absorbing matrix to create ions from large molecules with minimal fragmentation. It has been applied to the analysis of biomolecules (biopolymers such as DNA, proteins, peptides and sugars) and large organic molecules (such as polymers, dendrimers and other macromolecules), which tend to be fragile and fragment when ionized by more conventional ionization methods. It is similar in character to electrospray ionization (ESI) in that both techniques are relatively soft (low fragmentation) ways of obtaining ions of large molecules in the gas phase, though MALDI typically produces far fewer multi-charged ions.\n\nMALDI methodology is a three-step process. First, the sample is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate. Second, a pulsed laser irradiates the sample, triggering ablation and desorption of the sample and matrix material. Finally, the analyte molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of ablated gases, and then they can be accelerated into whichever mass spectrometer is used to analyse them.\n\nThe term matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) was coined in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These researchers found that the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266 nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed with this kind of \"matrix\". The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the \"ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method\" that combined 30 nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337 nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266 nm laser. Further improvements were realized through the use of a 355 nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337 nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.\n\nThe matrix consists of crystallized molecules, of which the three most commonly used are 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (α-CHCA, alpha-cyano or alpha-matrix) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). A solution of one of these molecules is made, often in a mixture of highly purified water and an organic solvent such as acetonitrile (ACN) or ethanol. A counter ion source such as Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is usually added to generate the [M+H] ions. A good example of a matrix-solution would be 20 mg/mL sinapinic acid in ACN:water:TFA (50:50:0.1).\nThe identification of suitable matrix compounds is determined to some extent by trial and error, but they are based on some specific molecular design considerations. They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several conjugated double bonds, as seen in the structure of cinnamic acid. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.\n\nThe matrix solution is mixed with the analyte (e.g. protein-sample). A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both hydrophobic and water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn analysis of biological systems, Inorganic salts, which are also part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process. The salts can be removed by solid phase extraction or by washing the dried-droplet MALDI spots with cold water. Both methods can also remove other substances from the sample. The matrix-protein mixture is not homogenous because the polarity difference leads to a separation of the two substances during co-crystallization. The spot diameter of the target is much larger than that of the laser, which makes it necessary to make many laser shots at different places of the target, to get the statistical average of the substance concentration within the target spot.\nThe matrix can be used to tune the instrument to ionize the sample in different ways. As mentioned above, acid-base like reactions are often utilized to ionize the sample, however, molecules with conjugated pi systems, such as naphthalene like compounds, can also serve as an electron acceptor and thus a matrix for MALDI/TOF. This is particularly useful in studying molecules that also possess conjugated pi systems. The most widely used application for these matrices is studying porphyrin like compounds such as chlorophyll. These matrices have been shown to have better ionization patterns that do not result in odd fragmentation patterns or complete loss of side chains. It has also been suggested that conjugated porphryin like molecules can serve as a matrix and cleave themselves eliminating the need for a separate matrix compound.\n\nThere are several variations of the MALDI technology and comparable instruments are today produced for very different purposes. From more academic and analytical, to more industrial and high throughput. The MS field has expanded into requiring ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as the FT-ICR instruments as well as more high-throughput instruments. As many MALDI MS instruments can be bought with an interchangeable ionization source (Electrospray ionization, MALDI, Atmospheric pressure ionization, etc.) the technologies often overlap and many times any soft ionization method could potentially be used. For more variations of soft ionization methods go to Soft laser desorption or Ion source.\n\nMALDI techniques typically employ the use of UV lasers such as nitrogen lasers (337 nm) and frequency-tripled and quadrupled (355 nm and 266 nm respectively).\n\nInfrared laser wavelengths used for infrared MALDI include the 2.94 μm , mid-IR optical parametric oscillator, and 10.6 μm carbon dioxide laser. Although not as common, infrared lasers are used due to their softer mode of ionization. IR-MALDI also has the advantage of greater material removal (useful for biological samples), less low-mass interferences, and compatibility with other matrix-free laser desorption mass spectrometry methods.\n\nThe type of a mass spectrometer most widely used with MALDI is the TOF (time-of-flight mass spectrometer), mainly due to its large mass range. The TOF measurement procedure is also ideally suited to the MALDI ionization process since the pulsed laser takes individual 'shots' rather than working in continuous operation. MALDI-TOF instruments are often equipped with a reflectron (an \"ion mirror\") that reflects ions using an electric field. This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution. Modern commercial reflectron TOF instruments reach a resolving power m/Δm of 50,000 FWHM (full-width half-maximum, Δm defined as the peak width at 50% of peak height) or more.\n\nMALDI has been coupled with IMS-TOF MS to identify phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides.\n\nMALDI-FT-ICR MS has been demonstrated to be a useful technique where high resolution MALDI-MS measurements are desired.\n\nAtmospheric pressure (AP) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is an ionization technique (ion source) that in contrast to vacuum MALDI operates at normal atmospheric environment. The main difference between vacuum MALDI and AP-MALDI is the pressure in which the ions are created. In vacuum MALDI, ions are typically produced at 10 mTorr or less while in AP-MALDI ions are formed in atmospheric pressure. In the past the main disadvantage of the AP-MALDI technique compared to the conventional vacuum MALDI has been its limited sensitivity; however, ions can be transferred into the mass spectrometer with high efficiency and attomole detection limits have been reported. AP-MALDI is used in mass spectrometry (MS) in a variety of applications ranging from proteomics to drug discovery. Popular topics that are addressed by AP-MALDI mass spectrometry include: proteomics; mass analysis of DNA, RNA, PNA, lipids, oligosaccharides, phosphopeptides, bacteria, small molecules and synthetic polymers, similar applications as available also for vacuum MALDI instruments. The AP-MALDI ion source is easily coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer or any other MS system equipped with ESI (electrospray ionization) or nanoESI source.\n\nIn aerosol mass spectrometry, one of the ionization techniques consists in firing a laser to individual droplets. These systems are called single particle mass spectrometers (SPMS). The sample may optionally be mixed with a MALDI matrix prior to aerosolization.\n\nThe laser is fired at the matrix crystals in the dried-droplet spot. The matrix absorbs the laser energy and it is thought that primarily the matrix is desorbed and ionized (by addition of a proton) by this event. The hot plume produced during ablation contains many species: neutral and ionized matrix molecules, protonated and deprotonated matrix molecules, matrix clusters and nanodroplets. Ablated species may participate in the ionization of analyte, though the mechanism of MALDI is still debated. The matrix is then thought to transfer protons to the analyte molecules (e.g., protein molecules), thus charging the analyte. An ion observed after this process will consist of the initial neutral molecule [M] with ions added or removed. This is called a quasimolecular ion, for example [M+H] in the case of an added proton, [M+Na] in the case of an added sodium ion, or [M-H] in the case of a removed proton. MALDI is capable of creating singly charged ions or multiply charged ions ([M+nH]) depending on the nature of the matrix, the laser intensity, and/or the voltage used. Note that these are all even-electron species. Ion signals of radical cations (photoionized molecules) can be observed, e.g., in the case of matrix molecules and other organic molecules.\n\nThe gas phase proton transfer model, implemented as the coupled physical and chemical dynamics (CPCD) model, of UV laser MALDI postulates primary and secondary processes leading to ionization. Primary processes involve initial charge separation through absorption of photons by the matrix and pooling of the energy to form matrix ion pairs. Primary ion formation occurs through absorption of a UV photon to create excited state molecules by\n\nwhere S is the ground electronic state, S the first electronic excited state, and S is a higher electronic excited state. The product ions can be proton transfer or electron transfer ion pairs, indicated by M and M above. Secondary processes involve ion-molecule reactions to form analyze ions.\nThe lucky survivor model (cluster ionization mechanism) postulates that analyte molecules are incorporated in the matrix maintaining the charge state from solution. Ion formation occurs through charge separation upon fragmentation of laser ablated clusters. Ions that are not neutralized by recombination with photoelectrons or counter ions are the so-called lucky survivors.\n\nThe thermal model postulates that the high temperature facilitates the proton transfer between matrix and analyte in melted matrix liquid. Ion-to-neutral ratio is an important parameter to justify the theoretical model, and the mistaken citation of ion-to-neutral ratio could result in an erroneous determination of the ionization mechanism. The model quantitatively predicts the increase in total ion intensity as a function of the concentration and proton affinity of the analytes, and the ion-to-neutral ratio as a function of the laser fluences. This model also suggests that metal ion adducts (e.g., [M+Na] or [M+K]) are mainly generated from the thermally induced dissolution of salt.\n\nThe matrix-assisted ionization (MAI) method uses matrix preparation similar to MALDI but does not require laser ablation to produce analyte ions of volatile or nonvolatile compounds. Simply exposing the matrix with analyte to the vacuum of the mass spectrometer creates ions with nearly identical charge states to electrospray ionization. It is suggested that there are likely mechanistic commonality between this process and MALDI.\n\nIn proteomics, MALDI is used for the rapid identification of proteins isolated by using gel electrophoresis: SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, strong/weak ion exchange, isotope coded protein labelling (ICPL), and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Peptide mass fingerprinting is the most popular analytical application of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers. MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometers are used to reveal amino acid sequence of peptides using post-source decay or high energy collision-induced dissociation (further use see mass spectrometry).\n\nLoss of sialic acid has been identified in papers when DHB has been used as a matrix for MALDI MS analysis of glycosylated peptides. Using sinapinic acid, 4-HCCA and DHB as matrices, S. Martin studied loss of sialic acid in glycosylated peptides by metastable decay in MALDI/TOF in linear mode and reflector mode. A group at Shimadzu Corporation derivatized the sialic acid by an amidation reaction as a way to improve detection sensitivity and also demonstrated that ionic liquid matrix reduces a loss of sialic acid during MALDI/TOF MS analysis of sialylated oligosaccharides. THAP, DHAP, and a mixture of 2-aza-2-thiothymine and phenylhydrazine have been identified as matrices that could be used to minimize loss of sialic acid during MALDI MS analysis of glycosylated peptides.\n\nIt has been reported that a reduction in loss of some post-translational modifications can be accomplished if IR MALDI is used instead of UV MALDI\n\nIn molecular biology, a mixture of 5-methoxysalicylic acid and spermine can be used as a matrix for oligonucleotides analysis in MALDI mass spectrometry, for instance after oligonucleotide synthesis.\n\nSome synthetic macromolecules, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers, and other assemblies, have molecular weights extending into the thousands or tens of thousands, where most ionization techniques have difficulty producing molecular ions. MALDI is a simple and fast analytical method that can allow chemists to rapidly analyze the results of such syntheses and verify their results.\n\nIn polymer chemistry MALDI can be used to determine the molar mass distribution. Polymers with polydispersity greater than 1.2 are difficult to characterize with MALDI due to the signal intensity discrimination against higher mass oligomers.\n\nA good matrix for polymers is dithranol or AgTFA. The sample must first be mixed with dithranol and the AgTFA added afterwards; otherwise the sample would precipitate out of solution.\n\nMALDI/TOF spectra are used for the identification of micro-organisms such as bacteria or fungi. A portion of a colony of the microbe in question is placed onto the sample target and overlaid with matrix. The mass spectra generated are analyzed by dedicated software and compared with stored profiles. Species diagnosis by this procedure is much faster, more accurate and cheaper than other procedures based on immunological or biochemical tests. MALDI/TOF is becoming a standard method for species identification in medical microbiological laboratories.\n\nOne main advantage over other microbiological identification methods is its ability to rapidly and reliably identify, at low cost, a wide variety of microorganisms directly from the selective medium used to isolate them. The absence of the need to purify the suspect or \"presumptive\" colony allows for a much faster turn-around times.\n\nAnother advantage is the potential to predict antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria. A single mass spectral peak can predict methicillin resistance of \"Staphylococcus aureus\" MALDI can also detect carbapenemase of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including \"Acinetobacter baumannii\" and \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\".\nHowever, most proteins that mediate antibiotic resistance are larger than MALDI-TOF's 2000–20,000 Da range for protein peak interpretation and only occasionally, as in the 2011 KPC outbreak at the NIH, a correlation between a peak and resistance conferring protein can be made.\n\nMALDI/TOF spectra have been used for the detection and identification of various parasites such as trypanosomatids, \"Leishmania\" and \"Plasmodium\".\nIn addition to these unicellular parasites, MALDI/TOF can be used for the identification of parasitic insects such as lice or cercariae, the free-swimming stage of trematodes.\n\nMALDI/TOF spectra are often utilized in tandem with other analysis and spectroscopy techniques in the diagnosis of diseases. MALDI/TOF is a diagnostic tool with much potential because it allows for the rapid identification of proteins and changes to proteins without the cost or computing power of sequencing nor the skill or time needed to solve a crystal structure in X-ray crystallography.\n\nOne example of this is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of premature infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of sepsis, and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC. There is hope that a similar technique could be used as a quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.\n\nAnother example of the diagnostic power of MALDI/TOF is in the area of cancer. Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most deadly and difficult to diagnose cancers. Impaired cellular signaling due to mutations in membrane proteins has been long suspected to contribute to pancreatic cancer. MALDI/TOF has been used to identify a membrane protein associated with pancreatic cancer and at one point may even serve as an early detection technique.\n\nMALDI/TOF can also potentially be used to dictate treatment as well as diagnosis. MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the drug resistance of bacteria, especially to β-lactams (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics. It is predicted that this could serve as a method for identifying a bacterium as drug resistant in as little as three hours. This technique could help physicians decide whether to prescribe more aggressive antibiotics initially.\n\n\n"}

The album was released in March 1969, by ABC Dunhill Records.\n\nIt was the first Steppenwolf album to feature bass player Nick St. Nicholas; and the last album to feature guitarist Michael Monarch, who left the band in August 1969. Although it was less critically acclaimed than their successful first two albums, \"Steppenwolf\" and \"The Second\", it contains a few well-known hits, such as \"It's Never Too Late\" and \"Jupiter's Child\", as well as \"Rock Me,\" which had been featured in the 1968 film \"Candy\". Although the band would be very successful in the early 1970s, \"At Your Birthday Party\" would be their last top ten album and features their last top ten single. The album showcases Steppenwolf coming out of, but not yet completely abandoning, the psychedelia of \"The Second\" and stepping into the distinctive hard rock of their later releases.\n\nThe album's cover was designed by art director Gary Burden. The original LP was a gatefold with a punched-out front cover; the punchout revealed a photo of the band which comprised the inner sleeve's recto. This photo of the band was shot by Henry Diltz, and it shows the band sitting in the remnants of amplifiers and equipment in a charred house which had belonged to Canned Heat. (A 1969 fire ripped through Canned Heat's house and rehearsal studio on Lookout Mountain Ave in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California.) Original lead guitarist Michael Monarch did not show up for the photo shoot. Steppenwolf producer Gabriel Mekler bore a physical resemblance to Monarch, and it was decided that Mekler would take Monarch's place in the photo. Mekler was able to hide himself all the more in the photo by sporting a pair of sunglasses. Initially, not too many noticed. Monarch was still in the band, however. (A dispelled myth is that Monarch was no longer in the band at the time of the photo shoot; he was in the band until the latter part of 1969, and the album came out in early 1969.) The LP was reissued on CD by MCA in late 1980s. MCA decided to not use the photo for their CD re-issue and opted only for the original unfinished war mouse painting, originally intended as the LP's cover. The resulting CD artwork indeed looks bare as a result. The surrounding black-and-white image of the LP's gate-fold sleeve was made by importing images of cartoon mouse heads onto the bodies of soldiers within an image of a U.S. Civil War trenched battlefield. The black-and-white portion of the album art was a collage made by Gary Burden, who planned to enlist Rick Griffin to paint a final version of the album art, but Dunhill Records declined to pay for the painting and so used Burden's black-and-white prototype.\n\n\n\nAlbum - Billboard (United States)\nSingles - Billboard (United States)\n"}

Translated, it means \"black-banded\", and is a reference to the often striking lateral black bands that run along the bodies of those in the genus \"Melanotaenia\".\n\nThe Melanotaeniidae is characterised by having their distal premaxillary teeth enlarged. They have a compressed body with the two dorsal fins being separated but with only a small gap between them. There are 3-7 spines in the first dorsal fin while the second has 6-22 rays, with the first ray being a stout spine in some species, the anal fin has 10-30 rays and, again, the first may be a stout spine in some species. The lateral line is either weakly developed or absent. They have comparatively large scales and these number 28-60 in the lateral series. The pelvic fins are attached to the fish’s abdomen by a membrane which runs along the length of the innermost ray and this is a feature which can be used to separate rainbowfishes from silversides, although the membrane is easily torn. The majority of the species in this family demonstrate sexual dimorphism with the males usually being the more colourful sex and also showing am elongated median fin ray.\n\nMost species of rainbowfish are less than in length, with some species measuring less than , while one species, \"Melanotaenia vanheurni\", reaches lengths of up to . They live in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including rivers, lakes, and swamps. Although they spawn all year round, they lay a particularly large number of eggs at the start of the local rainy season. The eggs are attached to aquatic vegetation, and hatch seven to 18 days later. Rainbowfish are omnivorous, feeding on small crustaceans, insect larvae, and algae.\n\nRainbowfish are popular aquarium fish along with \"Pseudomugil\" blue-eyes, which are another small, colourful fish found in a similar range and habitats. In the wild, some rainbowfish populations have been severely affected by the aggressive introduced eastern mosquitofish (\"Gambusia holbrooki\"), tilapia cichlids, and pollution.\n\nMelanotaeniidae is divided into a number of subfamilies, these families have been considered by some authorities to separate families but the 5th Edition of \"Fishes of the World\" classifies these as subfamilies of a single family as they form a monophyletic group or clade. They are therefore classified as follows:\n\nRainbowfish usually do best with tropical community fish, such as tetras, guppies, and other rainbowfish. However, two males may sometimes fight at breeding season if there are not enough females. Rainbowfish usually eat floating flakes in captivity, because in the wild they will often eat insects floating on the surface.\n\n"}

Owned by Pacific Telestations, Inc., it is sister to the local public access cable channel Local 2. KUAM-TV's studios are located at 600 Harmon Loop in Dededo, and its transmitter is located east-northeast of Agat.\n\nKUAM was Guam's first television station, signing on August 5, 1956 on analog channel 8. It carried programming from all three networks, but has always been a primary NBC affiliate. KUAM began its first broadcast in color in 1970. When Fox debuted in 1986, they carried its lineup as well. For a time, this made KUAM one of the few stations to be affiliated with all four major networks.\n\nDespite being affiliated with all four networks, KUAM was hindered by the fact that Guam was a day ahead of the U.S. mainland and that most shows, especially those from the network, were sent via air and/or mail, which meant that viewers would have to wait from a period of two weeks to a month to see any of the offerings. When it was not showing any network fare it featured local in-house programming, syndicated shows and films (mostly travel or cultural) to make up the difference.\n\nKUAM-TV, together with KUAM radio, were originally owned by Harry S. Engel, a former owner-manager of radio station KVEN in Ventura, California, with Adam Young International as the stations' representative. Two enterprising mainlanders, H. Scott Kilgore and Sam Rubin, formed the Pacific Broadcasting Corporation and bought the KUAM stations in 1964; the company changed its name to Pacific Telestations, Inc. in the 1970s.\n\nAt one point, the station also served the Northern Mariana Islands, via satellite station WSZE on VHF channel 10 in Saipan. However, by the 2000s, the station had gone dark and its license deleted by the FCC.\n\nKUAM would lose ABC to KTGM when it began operations in 1987, and lost Fox to the same station in 1990. CBS programming was dropped in 1995 with the launch of KUAM-LP; that station, in turn, would be added as KUAM's digital subchannel, broadcasting on channel 8.2, in 2009.\nAs technology and satellite started to take off and expand, KUAM began to gradually catch up with the rest of the continental United States.

Launched in August 2001, it was the younger sister version of \"Elle\" magazine, and similarly focused on beauty, health, entertainment and looking at bold fashion—its slogan: \"\"Dare to be different\"\". The magazine was published monthly and was based in New York City.\n\nIts staffers were informed in early April 2006 that \"Elle Girl\" (USA)'s final issue would be its June/July 2006 Summer Issue, while they were already in the middle of working on the August 2006 issue, which is traditionally the largest issue of the year-covering fall fashion and back-to-school topics. The company intended to continue updating the Elle Girl website, and create new media in conjunction with Alloy.com, as well as publishing bi-annual special issues.\n\nHachette Filipacchi CEO Jack Kliger, who was also responsible for closing three other Hachette magazines—\"George\", \"Mirabella\", and \"Travel Holiday\", commented on \"Elle Girl's\" future on the internet, stating: \"When teen girls are not on the Web, they are on their cells. The company will keep the website and work on Elle Girl ringtones, wallpaper mobile pages and projects in the mobile blogging area.\"\n\nELLEgirl.com relaunched in early 2008 after parting ways with Alloy.

It was founded by Steve Stavro, and operated from 1951 to 2001.\n\nStavro's father operated Louis Meat Market in Toronto from the 1930s to the 1950s. By 1954, Stavro had gone off on his own, managing outdoor markets and grocery stores under the Knob Hill Farms name. By the late 1950s, he was operating at nine sites in Toronto.\n\nIn 1963, Stavro changed direction and opened his first \"food terminal\"—a forerunner of the big-box store with 65,000 square feet (6,000 square-metres) of space just north of Toronto at Woodbine Avenue and Highway 7 in Markham.\nIn 1971, Knob Hill Farms expanded into Pickering with its second terminal. A third location — the first within Toronto, at Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street West on the site previously occupied by a National Cash Register (NCR) plant — followed in 1975. A second Toronto terminal opened in 1977 at Cherry Street and the Gardiner Expressway. The fifth store, billed as the largest food store in North America, opened in 1978 at Dixie Road and the Queen Elizabeth Way in Mississauga. This was the first store in the chain to sell some non-food products and was initially two storeys tall. The second storey was later closed to customers and used for storage. A restaurant, drug store, and wine shop all rented space within the building.\n\nIn 1981, the opened a location in Oshawa, Ontario in the structure of the Ontario Malleable Iron Company Limited's factory. The building had been used as an iron foundry since 1898, although the company had operated at that site since 1872. The 226,000 square foot (21,000 square-metre) store opened in June 1983. It had spurs for both Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway lines running right to the store. A pharmacy, bakery (RH Bakery—the RH stood for Richmond Hill), dentist's office, video rental store, as well as a wine store (Wine Rack), and a card shop were among the other businesses initially located within the terminal.\n\nThe Ontario Municipal Board and the Ontario government approved a site in 1982 for the seventh Knob Hill Farms terminal, this one at Weston Road and Highway 401 in the Weston community of Toronto. The 325,000 square foot (7.45 acres, or 30,200 square-metre) store opened in the fall of 1985.\nThe company proposed to convert an abandoned Canadian General Electric plant in Scarborough, Ontario into a store, but Scarborough City Council voted against the project in 1985 and that decision was upheld by the Ontario Municipal Board in 1987.\n\nIn 1988, the Ontario Labor Relations Board found that Knob Hill Farms had acted improperly two years earlier when it fired 14 employees who were trying to organize workers in Oshawa under the United Food and Commercial Workers union. The Oshawa store became the first in the Knob Hill Farms chain to be unionized.\n\nThe same year, construction began on a terminal in Cambridge, Ontario, the first outside the Greater Toronto Area. Construction was delayed repeatedly, resulting in penalties of about $2.4 million paid to the City of Cambridge. The 31,500 square-metre store finally opened in August 1991. The store began laying off workers less than two months after it opened. In 1999, the company proposed redeveloping the site into a convention centre.\n\nThe 10,000 square-metre, two-storey Riverdale food terminal at Carlaw Avenue and Gerrard Street in Toronto opened in 1992 and was the company's ninth location. A wholesale warehouse opened in Scarborough the following year.\n\nIn the 90's Knob Hill Farms was easily recognized in local newspapers with their one or two page ads printed in black and blue. Advertised on the air they used the jingle \"You know you get good value when you shop, at Knob Hill Farms.\"\n\nThe store in Weston was considered the largest supermarket in the Greater Toronto Area for 15 years. The site was an industrial building dating back to the 1930s which was used for the construction and assembly of airplanes (de Havilland Mosquito) by Massey Harris during World War II. Features around the supermarket included a man-made waterfall with three structures to the northwest side which stopped running after its closing. This was featured at the end of its commercials. The area was about 250 to 300m (800 to 1,000 ft) from south to north and about 50 m (150 ft) from west to east, with an extra 50 m to the northern part featuring parking lots and another 50 m with shipping sectors.\n\nThe south side featured several shops, rides and a photo shop near the west exit. A mural by artist John Richmond and a team of assistants depicted a history of food, from Prometheus stealing fire for cooking to Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau eating in space. Another mural facing the south side featuring Southern Ontario from downtown Toronto, with a street written as \"Baloor\" instead of Bloor Street and the Don Valley Parkway, the western suburbs, the Hamilton Mountain, Niagara Falls and near Fort Erie. The supermarket also featured two doorways in the east and the west sides. The walkway featured streetlights that looked liked a promenade or a walkway.\n\nIn August 2000, Stavro announced that all stores would close. At the time, the company had about 800 employees at 10 locations. Knob Hill Farms had lost market share to new competitors, including Costco and large Loblaws stores, and had racked up significant debts. The final store — the Weston site — closed in February 2001.\n\nThe Markham site was sold for $11.5 million to Michael-Angelo's Market Place Incorporated (supermarket closed and now LA Fitness). Loblaw Companies paid $34.2 million for three properties (Lansdowne & Dundas, Mississauga, and Carlaw & Gerrard) and reopened as No Frills stores. It subsequently purchased the Weston site, demolished the Knob Hill site and redeveloped as a Real Canadian Superstore, which opened in 2006. The Cambridge site is now occupied by Home Depot and Canadian Tire. The site in Scarborough became a Wal-Mart Supercentre. The Pickering store at 1630 Kingston Road was occupied by DOT Patio and T-Phat Supermarket, but now lays abandoned as building was demolished. The Cherry Street site became a T & T Supermarket in 2007 and now part of Loblaws chain but may close pending area redevelopment. The Knob Hill Farms building, at 500 Howard Street in Oshawa, became a discount/liquidation outlet and a flea market for a brief period of time before finally closing its doors and sealing off the property. In July 2014, the Oshawa location was expropriated for the new Oshawa Central GO Station.\n\n"}

This family includes the bee flies, true flies that have developed Batesian mimicry characteristics to avoid predators. That is, they look like bees because that helps them avoid bee-wary predators, but they lack stingers.\n\n\"P. willistoni\" also has larvae that act as parasitoids on other insect species. They drop their eggs strategically so that when the larvae emerge they can easily locate and consume grubs and caterpillars. The bee fly sometimes propels its eggs into holes where beetles live, and when the bee fly's eggs hatch, the larvae attack and eat the beetles' offspring. This species of bee fly lives on sand dunes, and so parasitizes sand dune insect species.\n\nThis species at a glance resembles a bee, fumbling flowers for nectar and sporting alternating orange and black bars down its abdomen. Unlike a bee, however, it has large red eyes and long, swept-back wings that it holds out from its body.\n\nIn Canada, it is found in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; in the United States, it occurs in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming; in Mexico, it is only found in Baja California.\n"}

The term nurse cell is used in several unrelated ways in different scientific fields.\n\nNurse cells are specialized macrophages residing in the bone marrow that assist in the development of red blood cells. They absorb the nuclei of immature red blood cells and may provide growth factors to help the red blood cells mature. In the bone marrow, immature red blood cells (erythroblasts) can be seen grouped in a cluster around a nurse cell.\n\nThe epithelial cell found in the cortex of the Thymus is also called a \"nurse cell.\" These cells produce Thymic hormones that cause T Lymphocytes to mature and differentiate.\n\nIn parasitology, a nurse cell is an infected cell in the disease trichinosis discovered by Dickson Despommier. A trichinella larva enters a cell and develops there, probably as a way of concealing itself from the immune system. The parasite has evolved a way of stimulating blood vessel development around the cell, in order to receive the nutrients it needs. In trichinosis, nurse cells are invariably skeletal muscle cells; these are the only type of cell that can support the parasite.\n\nIn mycology, a nurse cell is any hyphae that supplies food material to spores that have detached from the basidia; used especially in reference to taxa from the family Sclerodermataceae.\n\nIn respect to invertebrates, nurse cells are polytenic germline cells that contribute to the development of the oocyte, producing multiple nuclei. In fruit flies \"(Drosophila),\" nurse cells surround the developing oocyte and synthesize proteins and RNAs that are to be deposited in it. Nurse cells are highly polyploid (up to 8000C). They dump their cytoplasm containing RNAs and proteins into the oocyte via ring canals.\n\nDue to their high metabolic activity, nurse cells likely experience the DNA damaging effect of oxidative free radicals produced as a byproduct of this metabolism. This damaging effect would otherwise befall the DNA of the egg cells if they were responsible for their own synthesis. The many genome copies in each nurse cell may provide redundancy of genetic information that would allow the nurse cell to carry out its provisioning function even in the face of considerable oxidative DNA damage.\n\n"}

It was written by W. W. Fosdick (lyrics) and George R. Poulton (music). The melody was used in Elvis Presley's 1956 hit song \"Love Me Tender\".\n\nAura Lea was published by Poulton, an Englishman who had come to America with his family as a boy in 1838, and Fosdick in 1861. It was a sentimental ballad at a time when upbeat and cheerful songs were more popular in the music halls. It became popular as a minstrel song, and the tune was also taken up by the U.S. Military Academy as a graduating class song, called \"Army Blue\"; new lyrics by L. W. Becklaw were sung to the original melody.\n\nThe Civil War began shortly after the song's release, \"Aura Lea\" was adopted by soldiers on both sides, and was often sung around campfires.\n\nThe tune is familiar to modern audiences from the 1956 Elvis Presley #1 hit \"Love Me Tender\" with new lyrics by Ken Darby, a derivative adaptation of the original. A later Presley recording for the film \"The Trouble with Girls\" entitled \"Violet (Flower of N.Y.U.)\" also used the melody of \"Aura Lea\".\n\nThe lyrics as written by Fosdick:\n<poem>\nWhen the blackbird in the Spring,\nOn the willow tree,\nSat and rocked, I heard him sing,\nSinging Aura Lea.\nAura Lea, Aura Lea,\nMaid with golden hair;\nSunshine came along with thee,\nAnd swallows in the air.\n\nIn thy blush the rose was born,\nMusic, when you spake,\nThrough thine azure eye the morn,\nSparkling seemed to break.\nAura Lea, Aura Lea,\nBirds of crimson wing,\nNever song have sung to me,\nAs in that sweet spring.\n\nAura Lea! the bird may flee,\nThe willow's golden hair\nSwing through winter fitfully,\nOn the stormy air.\nYet if thy blue eyes I see,\nGloom will soon depart;\nFor to me, sweet Aura Lea\nIs sunshine through the heart.\n\nWhen the mistletoe was green,\nMidst the winter's snows,\nSunshine in thy face was seen,\nKissing lips of rose.\nAura Lea, Aura Lea,\nTake my golden ring;\nLove and light return with thee,\nAnd swallows with the spring.\n</poem>\n\n\"Aura Lee\" was sung by Frances Farmer and a male chorus in the 1936 film \"Come and Get It\", based on Edna Ferber's novel.\n\nBing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album \"Join Bing and Sing Along \" (1959)\n\nDiana Muldaur sings the song to David Carradine in the episode \"The Elixir\" of \"Kung Fu\".\n\nJerry Lanning performed the song in \"Big Star\", a 1962 episode of \"The Donna Reed Show\".\n\nThe television cavalry comedy \"F Troop\" used a variation of the song to welcome saloon singer Laura Lee in the episode \"She's Only a Build in a Girdled Cage\" (cf. \"She's only a bird in a gilded cage\").\n\nThe television western \"The Young Riders\" used the song in its series finale, which took place in 1861 and showed how the American Civil War was affecting its characters' lives.\n\nIt is the running theme music in the background of the 1954 John Ford film \"The Long Gray Line\".\n\nAllan Sherman topicalized the song with this polio-based version:\n<poem>\nEvery time you take vaccine, take it orally [a pun on \"Aura Lea\"]\nAs you know the other way is more painfully!\n</poem>\n\nAn episode of The Rockford Files called \"Aura Lee Farewell\". However the few lyrics that are recited are actually from the poem \"Annabel \nLee\" by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nOn the show \"Beverley Hills 90210\" on the episode The Real McCoy (05/10/95), Dylan McKay Luke Perry was led into a past life in the wild wild west through hypnotic regression with his hypnotherapist. During his hypnosis session, he imagined that he walked into a saloon, where a hurdy gurdy girl was singing \"Aura Lea.\" \n\nThe tune is used by the Cartoon Planet Band in the song \"I Love Almost Everybody\" which was also found on the associated album, \"Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que\".\n\nCaitlín R. Kiernan's 2007 novel \"Daughter of Hounds\" has a character singing the winter verse of \"Aura Lee\" during a snowstorm.\n\nOona Laurence sings the song in the Sofia Coppola film \"The Beguiled\" (2017).\n\nThe 1983 film \"Trading Places\" includes Ivy League stockbrokers at their racquet club singing a sexualized parody of this song about their college days and their fraternity's conquest of various women on locations at campus, with the refrain changed to \"Constance Frye.\" The television show \"How I Met Your Mother\" 2009 episode (season 5 episode 22) \"Robots Versus Wrestlers\" features Ted Mosby at an upper-class party singing the \"Trading Places\" \"Constance Frye\" version along with film director Peter Bogdanovich and \"The New York Times\" crossword editor Will Shortz.\n\nIn \"Revenge of the Nerds\", Betty Childs and the other girls from her sorority sing a parody (though not the exact tune) to the Tri-Lambs.\n\n"}

The film unfolds in the real time narration method. It is Donner's final directorial effort, as he retired the same year the film was released.\n\nJack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an alcoholic, burned-out NYPD detective. Despite a late shift the night before, his lieutenant orders him to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from local custody to the courthouse 16 blocks away to testify on a police corruption case before a grand jury at 10 a.m. Bunker tries to be friendly with Mosley, telling him of his aspirations to move to Seattle to become a cake baker with his sister who he has never met, but Mosley is uninterested, and stops at a liquor store. They are suddenly ambushed by a gunman, and Mosley drags Bunker to a local bar to take shelter and call for backup. Mosley's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse), and several other officers arrive. Nugent and his men are part of the corruption scheme, and he tells Mosley that Bunker is not worth defending as his testimony will likely expose several corrupt officers, including Nugent. The corrupt cops try to frame Bunker for firing at an officer before they try to kill him. Mosley intervenes, rescuing Bunker and fleeing.\n\nMosley briefly stops at his sister Diane's (Jenna Stern) apartment to retrieve guns and ammo, and learns the police have already approached her about his activities earlier that day. He and Bunker take steps to further elude the police, and Mosley is wounded in the process. They become cornered in a run-down apartment building as Nugent and his men search floor by floor. Mosley calls the district attorney to arrange for help, but purposely gives the wrong apartment number, suspecting there is a mole involved. Mosley and Bunker are able to escape onto a passenger bus, and as the police follow them, Mosley is forced to treat the passengers as hostages. The bus crashes into a construction site and is soon surrounded by the ESU. Aware that Nugent will likely order the ESU to raid the bus, risking the safety of the passengers, Mosley allows the passengers to go free, using their cover to allow Bunker to sneak off the bus in the confusion. Mosley finds a tape recorder in the discarded possessions on the bus, and prepares a farewell message to Diane.\n\nTo his surprise, Bunker returns to the bus; while Nugent is ready to fire on him, Nugent is made to stand down by a superior officer. Bunker has come to see Mosley as his friend and wants to be there for him to see this through. Bunker's tenacity convinces Mosley to get to the courthouse, and he manages to drive the bus into an alley, temporarily blocking the police from following them. He finds that Bunker has been wounded, and calls Diane, a paramedic, to bring an ambulance around to help, despite knowing she will be followed. Diane cares for Mosley and Bunker's wounds, though Bunker still needs further treatment at a hospital. As Diane's ambulance drives away, the police stop her but discover the ambulance is empty; she had a second ambulance pick up Mosley and Bunker that would not be under similar surveillance. Meanwhile, Mosley reveals to Bunker that should he testify, not only will Nugent be convicted but so would Mosley as one of the corrupt cops. Mosley gets off a block from the courthouse and wishes Bunker luck with his bakery, instructing the paramedic to take Bunker to the Port Authority and put him on a bus for Seattle. Bunker promises to send him a cake on his birthday.\n\nMosley continues to the courthouse, where the police and ESU are waiting for him, as well as the district attorney. Mosley enters the courthouse building through the underground garage, encountering Nugent alone, who tries unsuccessfully to dissuade him from testifying in Bunker's place. Mosley enters the courthouse proper, where one of Nugent's men (David Zayas) tries to shoot Mosley but is killed by one of the ESU snipers. Mosley informs the district attorney that he will testify in exchange for Bunker having his record expunged, also revealing that he had recorded the conversation with Nugent in the garage on the tape recorder, which he submits as evidence.\n\nTwo years later, Mosley is freed from prison. He celebrates his birthday with Diane and other friends, and is surprised to find that the cake had indeed come from Bunker, who has been successful in starting \"Eddie & Jack's Good Sign Bakery\" in Seattle.\n\nWillis originally wanted rapper Ludacris to play the part of Eddie Bunker. \"16 Blocks\" is the second film in which David Morse plays the villain to Bruce Willis as the protagonist; the first was \"12 Monkeys\", in which Morse plays Dr. Peters.\n\nThe film, released by Warner Bros., opened in the United States on March 3, 2006.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $12.7 million, which was the second-highest grossing film of the weekend. As of its May 15, 2006 closing date, the film grossed a total of $36.895 million in the U.S. box office. It made $65.6 million worldwide. According to Box Office Mojo, production costs were around $55 million. The film made $51.53 million on rentals, and remained on the DVD top 50 charts for 17 consecutive weeks.\n\nBased on 161 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 56% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 5.9/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Despite strong performances from Bruce Willis and Mos Def, \"16 Blocks\" barely rises above being a shopworn entry in the buddy-action genre.\" Metacritic, which assigns a rating in the 0–100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated a score of 63, based on 34 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMichael Atkinson of \"The Village Voice\" commented that \"the clichés come thick on the ground\" and called it \"a small movie trying to seem epic, or a bloated monster trying to seem lean.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars and called Willis and Mos Def \"a terrific team,\" concluding that \"Until Richard Wenk's script drives the characters into a brick wall of pukey sentiment, it's a wild ride.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and commended Mos Def for his \"character performance that's completely unexpected in an action movie,\" while calling the film \"a chase picture conducted at a velocity that is just about right for a middle-age alcoholic.\" Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" described the film as admirably old fashioned, praising Donner for his direction, but criticized the film for lacking originality, saying it feels like a remake of \"The Gauntlet\" directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nIn May 2013, Original Entertainment confirmed to have sealed a five-picture deal with Millennium Films to produce Bollywood remakes of \"Rambo\", \"The Expendables\", \"16 Blocks\", \"88 Minutes\", and \"Brooklyn's Finest\", with the productions for \"Rambo\" and \"The Expendables\" expected to start at the end of that year.\n\n"}

In 1974, David Schoengold, a record store owner and law school student, took over the station from Cole and expanded its broadcast schedule to 24 hours a day. It became very popular, with people waiting at all hours of the day to go on the air. It also gained the attention of National Public Radio, which sent tapes of All Things Considered. The nearest NPR station in the area was KWSU in Pullman, which was all but unlistenable in most of the city despite being only an hour south.\n\nSchoengold wanted a better station for the area, so he formed the Spokane Public Broadcasting Association to raise funding for a full-power public radio station. The 10-watt transmitter went off the air at the suggestion of one of Schoengold's friends in order to make it easier to raise the money. Getting the required funding took longer than expected, in part because the board was committed to keeping the proposed station as a community license. While linking up with a local nonprofit or an educational institution would have provided greater security, many board members believed that it would have also compromised the station's ability to program potentially controversial content.\n\nAfter several years of fundraising (with a final goal larger than that of a typical year's fundraising at area public television station KSPS-TV) and several delays in the on-air date, KPBX finally went on the air on January 20, 1980. The station was actually ready to sign on in 1979, having hired a general manager/program director and 13 staffers. However, FCC concerns forced a year's delay. The station had to postpone its first pledge drive because it was scheduled for May 18, the date Mount St. Helens erupted, and Pacific Northwest Bell requested that phone lines be used for emergencies only.\n\nToday, the station broadcasts a mix of NPR news and entertainment, classical music and jazz. KPBX also airs BirdNote, a two-minute show about birds and nature, produced in Washington State. \n\nIt is one of seven local Spokane FM radio stations heard across Canada to subscribers of the Shaw Direct satellite TV service.\n\nKPBX also broadcast the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library's Evergreen Radio Reading Service to blind and handicapped listeners on its 67kHz subcarrier, until the service's closure on 2014 August 15. KPBX was one of three major FM stations in Washington to do so; KUOW-FM in Seattle and KFAE-FM in Yakima were the others. This service could be freely and legally listened to by the public. However, this required a special FM radio capable of receiving such broadcasts; it could not be received on a standard FM radio.\n\nOther station data\n"}

The words are credited to Ken Darby under the pseudonym \"Vera Matson\", the name of his wife, and Elvis Presley. The RCA Victor recording by Elvis Presley was no. 1 on both the \"Billboard\" and \"Cashbox\" charts in 1956. The song was adapted from the melody for \"Aura Lee\", a sentimental Civil War ballad. The song is also featured in many other films and television shows such as \"FM, Touched By Love, This is Elvis, Porky's Revenge, Wild at Heart, Die Hard 2, Honeymoon in Vegas, Backbeat, Gaudi Afternoon, Machine Gun Molly, , William Eggleston in the Real World, California Dreamin', Love in Space, Masters of Sex, Devil's Due, Just Before I Go,\" \"90 Minutes in Heaven\", and \"Ready or Not\".\n\nThe 1956 song \"Love Me Tender\" puts new words to a new musical adaptation of the Civil War song \"Aura Lee,\" published in 1861. \"Aura Lee\" had music by George R. Poulton and words by W. W. Fosdick. It later became popular with college glee clubs and barbershop quartets. It was also sung at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.\n\nThe principal writer of the lyrics was Ken Darby, who also adapted Poulton's Civil War tune, which was in the public domain. The song was published by Elvis Presley Music. and credited to Presley and Darby's wife Vera Matson. Presley received co-songwriting credit due to his Hill & Range publishing deal which demanded songwriters concede 50 percent of the credit of their song if they wanted Presley to record it; Presley had songwriting input on only a very small number of the many songs he recorded\n\nAs with nearly all his early RCA recordings, Presley took control in the studio despite not being credited as producer. He would regularly change arrangements and lyrics to the point that the original song was barely recognizable. Ken Darby described Elvis Presley's role in the creation of the song:\n\nHe adjusted the music and the lyrics to his own particular presentation. Elvis has the most terrific ear of anyone I have ever met. He does not read music, but he does not need to. All I had to do was play the song for him once, and he made it his own! He has perfect judgment of what is right for him. He exercised that judgment when he chose 'Love Me Tender' as his theme song.\n\nElvis Presley performed \"Love Me Tender\" on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on September 9, 1956, shortly before the single's release and about a month before the movie, \"Love Me Tender\", was released (for which the reworded song had been written). After that, RCA received more than a million advance orders, making it a gold record before it was even released. The studio, 20th Century Fox, originally wanted to call the movie \"The Reno Brothers\", but instead re-titled it \"Love Me Tender\" to capitalize on the song's popularity.\n\nMovie producer David Weisbart would not allow Presley's regular band (Scotty Moore, Bill Black, and D.J. Fontana) to play on the soundtrack. Instead, The Ken Darby Trio provided the musical backing with Red Robinson on drums, Charles Prescott on bass, Vita Mumolo on guitar, and Jon Dodson on background vocals, with Presley providing only lead vocals.\n\nThe single debuted at #2 on the \"Best Sellers in Stores\" pop singles chart, the first time a single made its first appearance at the #2 position.\n\nThe song hit #1 on the \"Billboard\" charts the week ending November 3, 1956, remaining in the position for 5 weeks and reached no. 11 on the charts in the UK. \"Love Me Tender\" also reached number three for three weeks on the R&B chart.\n\nThis version was ranked #437 on \"Rolling Stone\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIn 1968, Presley recorded a 52-second track entitled \"Violet (Flower of N.Y.U.)\" for the soundtrack of the film \"The Trouble with Girls\". Unreleased until after Presley's death, the song was Presley's second adaptation of \"Aura Lee\".\n\nAlthough Presley never re-recorded \"Love Me Tender\" in a studio setting, two live recordings of the song were released on the albums: \"NBC-TV Special\" and \"\", with additional performances from concert and television appearances being released after Presley's death. The song was also performed in the Golden Globe-winning concert film \"Elvis on Tour\" (1972). As seen in that film, and in other filmed and recorded accounts, Presley generally performed only a portion of the song's lyrics live, instead usually using the song as a device to interact with (usually) female members of the audience.\n\n\"Love Me Tender\" was also included in the four song extended play (EP) album \"Love Me Tender\" of the songs from the film. The reprise of the song was not included on the EP.\n\n\nThe 1997 compact disc reissue with bonus tracks of the \"Jailhouse Rock\" EP contains these three versions.\n\n\n"}

It was also sold in Prince's own, now defunct, retail outlets. It is long out of print, thus very scarce and can fetch high prices second-hand.\n\nThe track \"Guess Who's Knockin'\" referenced Paul McCartney's \"Let 'Em In\" without credit. Probably to avoid any legal difficulties, the track was removed from second and subsequent pressings, making initial copies of the album even more highly sought after.\n\nThe album presents hip hop in the setting of a live band. Vocalist Tony M. raps on most of the songs and a variety of segues throughout the album provide a humorous storyline about the recording of the album, as well as Tony M.'s sexual exploits. Many of the themes are about racism and other ills in the black community. Prince plays a background role in the album, though he sings in character on the songs \"Black M.F. In the House\" and \"Johnny\". Both songs were played live in concert by Prince several times during this time period. The track \"Call the Law\" is older than most of the songs, being considered for release on an early version of 1991's \"Diamonds and Pearls\" and later being released as a B-side for a track from that album, \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\".

Sinegal (born January 1, 1936), also known as Jim Sinegal, is a retired American billionaire businessman who is the co-founder and former CEO of the Costco Wholesale Corporation, an international retail chain.\n\nHe was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955. He attended San Diego State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959.\n\nAfter Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium from 1977 to 1978, an executive vice president for the Price Company from 1978 to 1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company that acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first \"warehouse club\" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services.\n\nSinegal was a protégé of Sol Price, widely considered to be the \"father\" of the \"warehouse club\" concept. Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees — at every level of the company, including the stores — compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the \"lowest\" employee turnover rate in retail.\n\nIn 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price's earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price's breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc.\n\nIn 1997, the name of Sinegal's company was changed to Costco Wholesale.\n\nIn an interview published in the \"Houston Chronicle\" on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, \"We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now.\" A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, \"You have to take the shit with the sugar.\" Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later — a return of 354% (15.855%, annually). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five \"thousand\" percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.\n\nIn 2009, Sinegal was considered one of \"The TopGun CEOs\" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.\n\nOn January 1, 2012, Sinegal retired as CEO of Costco Wholesale, continued to serve as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. Sinegal retired from the Board of Directors in January 2018.\n\nIn 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise. The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).\n\nSinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children. Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA. \n\nSinegal is an avowed Democrat, and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Sinegal has hosted President Barack Obama at his home on two separate occasions.\n\nSinegal received an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth College alongside Jake Tapper and others in June of 2017. \n"}

He ruled as King of Macedon along with his brother Antipater from 297 to 294 BC.\n\nWhen Antipater murdered their mother and ousted him from power, Alexander turned to Pyrrhus and Demetrius I Poliorcetes for help in recovering his throne. To the former he promised, as the price of his alliance, the land on the sea-coast of Macedonia, together with the provinces of Ambracia, Acarnania, and Amphilochia. Demetrius, according to Plutarch, arrived after Pyrrhus had retired, and when matters had been settled between Alexander and Antipater. Demetrius was now an unwelcome visitor, and Alexander, while he received him with all outward civility, is said by Plutarch to have laid a plan for murdering him at a banquet, a plan which was stymied by the precautions of Demetrius. The next day Demetrius took his departure, and Alexander attended him as far as Thessaly. Here, at Larissa, Alexander went to dine with Demetrius, and, taking no guards with him, was assassinated, together with his friends who attended him.\n"}

Following retirement, he was appointed to DAE's Homi Bhabha Chair for a period of five years. Concurrently with his position in the DAE, he conceptualized setting up of Homi Bhabha National Institute and led it from 2005 to 2016. Presently he is Emeritus Professor, Homi Bhabha National Institute. His prior positions include Director of the Knowledge Management Group and Associate Director, Technical Coordination & International Relations Group at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). He represented BARC training school in the World Nuclear University in 2003.\n\nRavi B.

In 2016, Delhi college of Engineering Alumni Association bestowed him with a Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nDuring first 25 years of his career, Dr. Grover worked as a nuclear engineer and specialised in thermal hydraulics. He worked on fluid to fluid modelling techniques for two-phase flows, reactor fuel and core thermal hydraulics, safety analysis and process design of reactor systems and equipment. Post 1996, he took up managerial responsibilities including technology transfer, human resource development and extramural funding.\n\nOn 15 January 2013, the Prime Minister of India conferred on him the Lifetime Achievement Award for the year 2011 for his outstanding contributions in the field of nuclear engineering, towards national initiative to open international civil nuclear trade, further development of framework for governance of nuclear power and human resource development. The citation for the award stated, \"During a career spanning four decades, Dr. Grover has distinguished himself as an academic, research and development engineer and a science administrator. His knowledge of nuclear engineering and nuclear law has earned him the title 'nuclear diplomat'.\" Citation says, \" He played maximum role in all steps taken by the Government of India towards opening international civil nuclear trade.\" Citation also acknowledges his role during negotiations in 2005 aimed at India joining ITER and he has been leading the Indian delegation to ITER Council since its inception.\n\nIn 2014, he was conferred India's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri. In 2016, Delhi College of Engineering Alumni Association presented him a lifetime achievement award for his continued high level involvement in professional activities.\n\nRavi Grover is well known in India as a proponent of nuclear energy as can be seen from his publications related to nuclear energy. He is an editor of the International Journal of Nuclear Knowledge Management.\n\nDr Grover along with his colleagues formulated a scenario for growth of electricity demand in India by taking into consideration economic growth, population growth, and improvement in energy intensity of GDP and formulating a possible supply mix considering India's fuel resource base to delineate niche area for nuclear energy. This was the first such long-term forecast of electricity demand in India and firmly established the role of nuclear energy in India's electricity mix. Based on a very simple logic, in an article published in The Hindu, he explains why India needs nuclear energy. He has been writing in media about issues related to India's electricity needs and have been highlighting the importance of nuclear energy.\n\nHe has worked on details of India's regime on civil liability for nuclear damage and is credited with explaining fine detail regarding Supplier's liability.\n\nRavi Grover is one half of the Kakodkar-Grover duo who are chiefly responsible for the success of the Indo-US negotiations that culminated in the 123 agreement signed in July 2007. Anil Kakodkar and Ravi Grover were the technical advisors to India's politicians in the tense negotiations that led to the Indo-US nuclear agreement, a culmination of two years of painstaking negotiations.\n\nQuoted from Frontline magazine, Volume 24 – Issue 16 :: 11–24 Aug. 2007:\n\nOfficials of the DAE called it “a fantastic team effort” and complimented the crucial, but low-key, role of Ravi B. Grover, Director of the DAE’s Strategic Planning Group. According to the DAE, Grover, who is also Director of the Knowledge Management Group of BARC, stood like a rock against the onslaught of American demands. While the core negotiating team comprised officials of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), India’s High Commissioner to Singapore S. Jaishankar, Joint Secretary (Americas) Gayatri Kumar and Grover, National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan and Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon stepped into the picture when the negotiations reached a decisive stage. In the final round in Washington in July, AEC chairman and DAE Secretary Anil Kakodkar was available for consultations, although he did not participate directly in the negotiations.\nShivshankar Menon has described nuclear scientist Ravi Grover and the diplomat S Jaishankar as \"the sources of ideas and details\" for the civil nuclear initiative with the United States. Ravi Grover has written in detail about the initiative to open civil nuclear cooperation.\n\nHomi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI) was accredited as a deemed to be university in 2005 and Ravi Grover was its first Director.

{"id": "2190686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190686", "title": "Sutan Sjahrir", "text": "Sutan Sjahrir\n\nSutan Sjahrir (5 March 1909 – 9 April 1966) was an Indonesian revolutionary independence leader and prime minister, described as an idealistic Indonesian intellectual. He became the first prime minister of Indonesia in 1945, after a career as a key Indonesian nationalist organizer in the 1930s and 1940s. From there, Sutan worked hard as Prime Minister to ensure Indonesia was living up to its name. He was considered an idealist and an intellectual who despite his political interest, put his country first before his own needs. Unlike some of his colleagues, he did not support the Japanese and worked to gain independence for Indonesia.\n\nSjahrir was a close associate of the older statesman Mohammad Hatta, a key leader of the Indonesian revolution and leader of the Indonesian underground resistance during the Japanese occupation. Sutan Sjahrir was imprisoned by Sukarno, and then released by Sukarno in 1965 so he could seek medical treatment. Sjahrir went to Zurich Switzerland where he then died after a stroke at age 56.\n\nSjahrir was born in 1909 in Padang Panjang, West Sumatra. He was born to a Minangkabau family from Koto Gadang, Agam. His father was the chief public prosecutor in Medan and advisor to the Sultan of Deli. His eldest half-sister Siti Rohana (nicknamed the Minangkabau Kartini) was an advocate for women's education and a journalist with the first feminist newspaper of Sumatra. He studied (ELS and MULO) in Medan and in 1926 (AMS) in Bandung. During his school years in Medan, he was a violinist in Hotel de Boer at night. In Bandung he became co-founder of the 'People's University', battling illiteracy and raising funds for the performance of patriotic plays in the Priangan countryside.\n\nSjahrir arrived in the Netherlands in 1929, enrolling first at the University of Amsterdam and later becoming a law student at Leiden University where he gained an appreciation for socialist principles. He was a part of several labor unions as he worked to support himself. He was briefly the secretary of the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (\"Indonesian Association\"), an organization of Indonesian students in the Netherlands. Sjahrir was also one of the co-founders of \"Jong Indonesie\", an Indonesian youth association in lieu of the need of an association to assist in the development of Indonesian youth for further generations, only to change within a few years to \"Pemuda Indonesia\". This, in particular, played an important role in the Youth Congress (\"Sumpah Pemuda\"), in which the association helped the congress itself to run. During his political activities as a student in the Netherlands he became a close associate of the older independence activist Mohammad Hatta, future vice-president of Indonesia. While he spent years in exile in the Banda Islands, he taught the local children to love their country and inspired them in many ways.\n\nThe Perhimpoenan Indonesia came under increasing communist influence, and Hatta and Sjahrir were both expelled in 1931. In a reaction to the intrigue by communist cells in the PI against Hatta and himself Sjahrir stayed calm and in character. In his memoirs their Dutch associate Sol Tas recalls: \"\"He was not intimidated for one minute by official or quasi-official declarations, by communiques or other formulae, not afraid for one second of the maneuvers directed against him, and still less concerned for his reputation. That mixture of self-confidence and realism, that courage based on the absence of any ambition or vanity, marked the man.\"\"\n\nSjahrir had not finished his law degree, when Hatta sent Sjahrir ahead of him to the Dutch East Indies in 1931, to help set up the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Sjahrir was heavily involved in the \"Daulat Rajat\", the newspaper of the new PNI. Within a relatively short time he developed from a representative of Hatta into a political and intellectual leader with his own standing. Both leaders were imprisoned in the Cipinang Penitentiary Institution by the Dutch in March 1934 and convicted for nationalist activities in November 1934, exiled to Boven Digul where they arrived March 1935, then to Banda a year later, and just before the Indies fell to the Japanese in 1941, to Sukabumi.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Indonesia he had little public role, apparently sick with tuberculosis, while he was actually one of the few independence leaders that was involved in the resistance movement against the Japanese occupation. Sukarno, Hatta and Sjahrir had in fact agreed that Sjahrir would go underground to organise the revolutionary resistance while the other 2 would continue their cooperation with the Japanese occupier.\n\nAt the height of chaos and violence during the early Bersiap period of the Indonesian revolution Sjahrir published an epoch-making pamphlet named 'Our Struggle'. Originally published in Dutch as 'Indonesische Overpeinzingen' ('Indonesian Musings'), it was soon thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' in 1945, and was then translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York, 1949. The English version contains a considerable amount of additional text. \"\"Perhaps the high point of his career was the publication of his pamphlet 'Our Struggle'. Whoever reads that pamphlet today can scarcely comprehend what it demanded in insight and courage. For it appeared at a moment when the Indonesian masses, brought to the boiling point by the Japanese occupation and civil war, sought release in racist and other hysterical outbursts. Sjahrir's pamphlet went directly against this, and many must have felt his call for chivalry, for the understanding of other ethnic groups, as a personal attack.\"\" Sol Tas.\n\nAfter writing his pamphlet he was appointed Prime Minister by President Sukarno in November 1945 and served until June 1947. Professor Wertheim describes Sjahrir's early accomplishments as Prime minister as follows: \"\"...Sjahrir knows what he wants and will not be distracted by popular sentiment or circumstantiality. He is able to overturn a ministry fabricated by the Japanese and establish a new ministry of honest, fairly capable, fairly democratic and social minded men under his leadership. No small feat in revolutionary circumstances...\"\"\n\nDue to his non-cooperative stance during the Japanese occupation he was one of the few Republican leaders acceptable to the Dutch government during the early independence negotiations. In 1946 Sjahrir played a crucial role in negotiating the Linggadjati Agreement. Because his thoughts were ahead of his time he was often misunderstood and started to acquire internal political adversaries.\n\n\"If we determine the value of Indonesia's freedom by its genuinely democratic quality, then in our political struggle vis-a-vis the outside world, it is for this inner content that we must strive. \"The State of the Republic of Indonesia\" is only a name we give to whatever content we intend and hope to provide.\" In 'Perdjoeangan Kita' (Our Struggle), October 1945, Sjahrir.\n\nAlthough Sjahrir was one of the most significant Indonesian politicians of his time, he did not engage in politics through a sense of vocation nor out of interest, but rather through a sense of duty to his country and compatriots and commitment to his democratic ideals. Described as an omnivorous intellectual Sjahrir had education at the heart of his passion. When he was appointed Prime Minister in 1945, he was the youngest prime minister in the world only being 36 years old.\nSjahrir founded the Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI) in 1948 to politically oppose the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Sutan's socialist party ultimately failed to win support and was later banned in 1960. Already in the mid 1930s Sjahrir warned for the tendency of socialists to be dragged into the notions of the extreme political left. Sjahrir described his fear of the trend of socialists to adopt ideas of communist absolutism as follows: \"\"Those socialist activists, with all good intentions, suddenly and unnoticed become 'absolute' thinkers, 'absolutely' discarding freedom, 'absolutely' spitting on humanity and the rights of the individual.[...]They envision the terminus of human development as one huge military complex of extreme order and discipline [...]\"\"\n\nAlthough small, his party was very influential in the early post-independence years, because of the expertise and high education levels of its leaders. But the party performed poorly in the 1955 elections, partly due to the fact that the grassroots constituency at the time was unable to fully understand the concepts of social democracy Sjahrir was trying to convey. It was banned by President Sukarno in August 1960 because of its support for a rebellion in Sumatra and his oppostion to the president's policies.\n\nIn 1962 Sjahrir was jailed on alleged conspiracy charges for which he was never put on trial. Instead of fighting back and creating more conflicts, he choose to step back from politics and accept the consequences. During his imprisonment he suffered from high blood pressure and in 1965 had a stroke, losing his speech. He was sent to Zürich, Switzerland for treatment and died there in exile in 1966.\n\nAlthough a revolutionary opponent of Dutch colonialism his intellectual prowess was recognised by his adversaries and he remained highly respected in the Netherlands. After his death in 1966 the former Dutch Prime-Minister Professor Schermerhorn commemorated Sjahrir in a public broadcast on national radio, calling him a \"\"noble political warrior\"\" with \"\"high ideals\"\" and expressing the hope that he will be recognised as such by next generations in Indonesia.\n\nIn the 21st century Sjahrir's legacy in Indonesia is being publicly rehabilitated.\n\nIn 2009 Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said: \"“He was a thinker, a founding father, a humanistic leader and a statesman. He should be a model for the young generation of Indonesians. His thoughts, his ideas and his spirit are still relevant today as we face global challenges in democracy and the economy.”\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes misspelled \"Frasier,\" \"Frazer\" or \"Frazier.\"\n\nIn the past, it was also sometimes known as \"she-balsam\" because resin could be \"milked\" from its bark blisters, in contrast to the \"he balsam\" (red spruce) which could not be milked. It has also occasionally been called balsam fir, inviting confusion with \"A. balsamea\".\n\n\"Abies fraseri\" is a small evergreen coniferous tree typically growing between 30 and 50 feet (10–15 m) tall, but rarely to 80 ft (25 m), with a trunk diameter of 16 to 20 inches (40–50 cm), but rarely 30 in (75 cm). The crown is conical, with straight branches either horizontal or angled upward at 40° from the trunk; it is dense when the tree is young and more open in maturity. The bark is thin, smooth, grayish brown, and has numerous resinous blisters on juvenile trees, becoming fissured and scaly in maturity.\n\nThe leaves are needle-like; arranged spirally on the twigs but twisted at their bases to form 2 rows on each twig; they are 0.4–0.9 inches (10–23 mm) long and 79–87 mil (2–2.2 mm) broad; flat; flexible; rounded or slightly notched at their apices (tips); dark to glaucous green adaxially (above); often having a small patch of stomata near their apices; and having two silvery white stomatal bands abaxially (on their undersides). Their strong fragrance resembles turpentine.\n\nThe cones are erect; cylindrical; 1.4 to 2.75 inches (3.5–7 cm) long, rarely 3.2 in (8 cm), and 1–1.2 inches (2.5–3 cm) broad, rarely 1.5 in (4 cm) broad; dark purple, turning pale brown when mature; often resinous; and with long reflexed green, yellow, or pale purple bract scales. The cones disintegrate when mature at 4–6 months old to release the winged seeds.\n\nSome botanists regard the variety of Balsam fir named \"Abies balsamea\" var. \"phanerolepis\" as a natural hybrid with Fraser fir, denominated \"Abies × phanerolepis\" (Fernald) Liu.\n\nFraser fir is monoecious, meaning that both male and female cones (strobili) occur on the same tree. Cone buds usually open from mid-May to early June. Female cones are borne mostly in the top few feet of the crown and on the distal ends of branches. Male cones are borne below female cones, but mostly in the upper half of the crown. Seed production may begin when trees are 15 years old. Seeds germinate well on mineral soil, moss, peat, decaying stumps and logs, and even on detritus or litter that is sufficiently moist.\n\n\"Abies fraseri\" is restricted to the southeastern Appalachian Mountains in southwestern Virginia, western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, where it occurs at high elevations, from 3,900 feet to the summit of Mount Mitchell, the highest point in the region at 6,683 feet (1,200 m up to 2,037 m). It lives in acidic moist but well-drained sandy loam, and is usually mixed with \"Picea rubens\" (red spruce). Other trees it grows with include \"Tsuga caroliniana\" (Carolina hemlock), \"Betula alleghaniensis\" (yellow birch), \"Betula papyrifera\" (paper birch), and \"Acer saccharum\" (sugar maple). The climate is cool and moist, with short, cool summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall.\n\n\"Abies fraseri\" is severely damaged by a non-native insect, the balsam woolly adelgid (\"Adelges piceae\"). The insect's introduction and spread led to a rapid decline in Fraser fir across its range, with over 80 percent of mature trees having been killed. The rapid regeneration of seedlings with lack of canopy has led to good regrowth of healthy young trees where the mature forests once stood. However, when these young trees get old enough for the bark to develop fissures, they may be attacked and killed by the adelgids as well.\n\nFor this reason, the future of the species is still uncertain, though the Mount Rogers (Virginia) population has largely evaded adelgid mortality. The decline of the Fraser fir in the southern Appalachians has contributed to loss of moss habitat which supports the spruce-fir moss spider.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the adelgid population was down. While two-thirds of adult trees had been killed by the 1980s, a study of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park showed that as of 2020, the number of adult trees had increased over the previous 30 years, with three times as many on Clingmans Dome.\n\nThe Fraser fir is an endangered species. Threats include climate change, balsam woolly adelgid and destruction of trees for Christmas trees and timber.\n\nAlthough not important as a source of timber, Fraser fir is widely used as a Christmas tree. Its mild fragrance, shape, strong limbs, and ability to retain its soft needles (which do not prick easily when hanging ornaments) for a long time when cut make it one of the best trees for this purpose. Fraser fir has been used more times as the White House Christmas tree (the official Christmas tree of the President of the United States's White House) than any other tree.\n\nIt is grown in plantations in Scotland and sold by the thousands throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is also cultivated from seedlings in several northern states in the USA and adjacent parts of Quebec Province, especially for the Christmas tree trade.\n\nThe combination of form, needle retention, dark blue-green color, pleasant scent and excellent shipping characteristics has led to Fraser fir being a most popular Christmas tree species. Growing and harvesting this species for Christmas trees and boughs is a multimillion-dollar business in the southern Appalachians. North Carolina produces the majority of Fraser fir Christmas trees. It requires from seven to ten years in the field to produce a high tree. In 2005, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation making the Fraser fir the official Christmas tree of North Carolina.\n\n\n"}

It provides a continuity of the personality in the absence of a permanently abiding \"self\" (ātman), which Buddhism denies. The mindstream provides a continuity from one life to another, akin to the flame of a candle which may be passed from one candle to another: William Waldron writes that \"Indian Buddhists see the 'evolution' of mind i[n] terms of the continuity of individual mind-streams from one lifetime to the next, with karma as the basic causal mechanism whereby transformations are transmitted from one life to the next.\"\n\nAccording to Waldron, \"[T]he mind stream (\"santāna\") increases gradually by the mental afflictions (\"kleśa\") and by actions (\"karma\"), and goes again to the next world. In this way the circle of existence is without beginning.\"\n\nThe vāsanās \"karmic imprints\" provide the karmic continuity between lives and between moments. According to Lusthaus, these vāsanās determine how one \"actually sees and experiences the world in certain ways, and one actually becomes a certain type of person, embodying certain theories which immediately shape the manner in which we experience.\"\n\n\"Citta\" holds the semantic field of \"that which is conscious\", \"the act of mental apprehension known as ordinary consciousness\", \"the conventional and relative mind/heart\". \"Citta\" has two aspects: \"...Its two aspects are attending to and collecting of impressions or traces (Sanskrit: \"vāsanā\") cf. \"vijñāna\".\" \"\" or \"santāna\" (Sanskrit) holds the semantic field of \"eternal\", \"continuum\", \"a series of momentary events\" or \"life-stream\".\n\n\"Citta\" is often rendered as \"sems\" in Tibetan and saṃtāna corresponds to \"rgyud\", which holds the semantic field of \"continuum\", \"stream\", and \"thread\"-- is therefore rendered \"sems rgyud.\" \"Rgyud\" is the term that Tibetan translators (Tibetan: \"lotsawa\") employed to render the Sanskrit term \"\"tantra\"\".\n\n\"Thugs-rgyud\" is a synonym for \"sems rgyud\"--\"Thugs\" holds the semantic field: \"Buddha-mind\", \"(enlightened) mind\", \"mind\", \"soul\", \"spirit\", \"purpose\", \"intention\", \"unbiased perspective\", \"spirituality\", \"responsiveness\", \"spiritual significance\", \"awareness\", \"primordial (state, experience)\", \"enlightened mind\", \"heart\", \"breast\", \"feelings\" and is sometimes a homonym of \"citta\" (Sanskrit). \"Thugs-rgyud\" holds the semantic field \"wisdom\", \"transmission\", \"heart-mind continuum\", \"mind\", \"[continuum/ stream of mind]\" and \"nature of mind.\"\n\nThe Chinese equivalent of Sanskrit \"citta-saṃtāna\" and Tibetan \"sems-kyi rgyud\" (\"mindstream\") is \"xin xiangxu\" (). According to the \"Digital Dictionary of Buddhism\", \"xīn xiāngxù\" means \"continuance of the mental stream\" (from Sanskrit \"citta-saṃtāna\" or \"citta-saṃtati\"), contrasted with \"wú xiàngxù\" 無相續 \"no continuity of the mental stream\" (from \"asaṃtāna\" or \"asaṃdhi\") and \"shì xiāngxù\" 識相續 \"stream of consciousness\" (from \"vijñāna-saṃtāna\").\n\nThis compound combines \"xin\" \"heart; mind; thought; conscience; core\" and \"xiangxu\" \"succeed each other\", with \"xiang\" \"form, appearance, countenance, phenomenon\" and \"xu\" or \"continue; carry on; succeed\". Thus it means \"the continuum of mind and phenomena\".\n\n\"Xin xiangxu\" is pronounced \"sim sangsok\" in Korean and \"shin sōzoku\" in Japanese.\n\nThe notion of \"citta-santāna\" developed in later Yogacara-thought, where \"citta-santāna\" replaced the notion of ālayavijñāna, the store-house consciousness in which the karmic seeds were stored. It is not a \"permanent, unchanging, transmigrating entity\", like the atman, but a series of momentary consciousnesses.\n\nLusthaus describes the development and doctrinal relationships of the store consciousness (\"ālaya-vijñāna\") and Buddha nature (\"tathāgatagarbha\") in Yogācāra. To avoid reification of the \"ālaya-vijñāna\",\nDharmakīrti (fl. 7th century) wrote a treatise on the nature of the mind stream in his \"Substantiation of Other mind streams\" (\"Saṃtãnãntarasiddhi\"). According to Dharmakirti the mind stream was beginningless temporal sequence.\n\nThe notion of mind stream was further developed in Vajrayāna (tantric Buddhism), where \"mind stream\" (\"sems-rgyud\") may be understood as a stream of succeeding moments, within a lifetime, but also in-between lifetimes. The 14th Dalai Lama holds it to be a continuum of consciousness, extending over succeeding lifetimes, though without a self or soul.\n\n\n\n"}

In particular, choosing formula_13 shows that the empty sequence belongs to every tree.\n\nA branch through a tree formula_5 is an infinite sequence of elements of formula_1, each of whose finite prefixes belongs to formula_5. The set of all branches through formula_5 is denoted formula_18 and called the body of the tree formula_5.\n\nA tree that has no branches is called wellfounded; a tree with at least one branch is illfounded. By Kőnig's lemma, a tree on a finite set with an infinite number of sequences must necessarily be illfounded.\n\nA finite sequence that belongs to a tree formula_5 is called a terminal node if it is not a prefix of a longer sequence in formula_5. Equivalently, formula_22 is terminal if there is no element formula_23 of formula_1 such that that formula_25. A tree that does not have any terminal nodes is called pruned.\n\nIn graph theory, a rooted tree is a directed graph in which every vertex except for a special root vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, and in which the path formed by following these edges from any vertex eventually leads to the root vertex.\nIf formula_5 is a tree in the descriptive set theory sense, then it corresponds to a graph with one vertex for each sequence in formula_5, and an outgoing edge from each nonempty sequence that connects it to the shorter sequence formed by removing its last element. This graph is a tree in the graph-theoretic sense. The root of the tree is the empty sequence.\n\nIn order theory, a different notion of a tree is used: an order-theoretic tree is a partially ordered set with one minimal element in which each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors.\nEvery tree in descriptive set theory is also an order-theoretic tree, using a partial ordering in which two sequences formula_5 and formula_29 are ordered by <math>T if and only if formula_5 is a proper prefix of formula_29. The empty sequence is the unique minimal element, and each element has a finite and well-ordered set of predecessors (the set of all of its prefixes).\nAn order-theoretic tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences if and only if each of its elements has finite height (that is, a finite set of predecessors).\n\nThe set of infinite sequences over formula_1 (denoted as formula_33) may be given the product topology, treating \"X\" as a discrete space.\nIn this topology, every closed subset formula_34 of formula_33 is of the form formula_18 for some pruned tree formula_5.\nNamely, let formula_5 consist of the set of finite prefixes of the infinite sequences in formula_34. Conversely, the body formula_18 of every tree formula_5 forms a closed set in this topology.\n\nFrequently trees on Cartesian products formula_42 are considered. In this case, by convention, we consider only the subset formula_5 of the product space, formula_44, containing only sequences whose even elements come from formula_1 and odd elements come from formula_46 (e.g., formula_47). Elements in this subspace are identified in the natural way with a subset of the product of two spaces of sequences, formula_48 (the subset for which the length of the first sequence is equal to or 1 more than the length of the second sequence).\nIn this way we may identify formula_49 with formula_18 for over the product space. We may then form the projection of formula_18,\n\n"}

FirstClass's primary markets are the higher-education and K-12 education sectors, including four of the top ten largest school districts in the United States (Las Vegas, NV's Clark County School District, Florida's Broward County Public Schools, Hillsborough County Public Schools, and Chicago Public Schools).\n\nThe product is part of OpenText's Portfolio Group and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms, for both client and server. iPhone and Android client applications are also available. According to the company, the product is used at over 3,000 organizations and has 9 million users worldwide. \n\nFirstClass was originally a product of SoftArc, formed by three former members of Bell Northern Research, Nortel's research arm located in downtown Toronto. The team, consisting of two brothers and a friend, Steve Asbury, Jon Asbury and Scott Welch had been the primary developers of the successful Meridian Mail system, and styled themselves as the Toronto Ideas Group. After a run-in with management, the three left and formed SoftArc as a consulting firm.\n\nFirstClass was created in response to a request by a family friend who worked at the Scarborough Board of Education (now part of the Toronto District School Board). He asked them to find a reasonable Macintosh-based e-mail system that offered both LAN and modem support, a real GUI, and supported both private e-mail as well as public discussion areas (forums). He wanted a system that \"even teachers could use\". BBSes offered modem support and public forums, but typically had no LAN support and were character-based. Various LAN e-mail systems existed, those on the Mac had reasonable GUI's, but they tended to have poor modem support and few offered forums.\n\nThe team found only one product, AppleLink, which came close to filling the requirements. However, it was run on a mainframe for Apple Computer and couldn't be purchased, so the team offered to build a system under contract for $85,000. Scarborough Board really liked the Hypercard prototype, but couldn't afford the price, so they offered to buy a system for $9000 and then help sell it to other boards. The proposal was accepted, and work on EduNet started some time in 1989, debuting in 1990 at the ECOO conference.\n\nThe first implemented FirstClass system, operated by the Scarborough Board of Education and named \"ScriBE\", was administered by the Computers in Education department. It offered access to teachers, students, and parents. In the autumn of 1997, ScriBE was connected successfully to the internet.\n\nKey to FirstClass's operation was the underlying FCP (FirstClass Protocol). FCP was a transport layer networking protocol that all FirstClass communications used. The protocol guaranteed error-free communications for all activities, not just file transfers. FCP could run on several different physical layers, starting with modems and AppleTalk, and later adding Novell's IPX and TCP/IP. Both the client and server could communicate over any of these links, allowing a user to move from office to home and have access to the same server.\n\nFCP was based on a sliding window protocol, using a wide variety of packet sizes tuned to different networking protocols. Later versions of FCP could turn off their own error correction systems when running over error-free links like TCP/IP. FCP also implemented an optional encryption system based on the Blowfish cipher. With all of these features turned off, FCP still offered good performance even on the 2400 bit/s modems common in the era.\n\nAdditionally, every FCP packet included a \"task number\" identifier, similar to the port identifier in TCP/IP. This allowed FCP to construct a number of \"virtual links\" between each client and server. The server implemented a multithreaded kernel and opened a new thread for every task requested by a client. Users could therefore upload and download files at the same time, while simultaneously reading and writing mail.\n\nAfter renaming the product to the more generic \"FirstClass\", they started demonstrating early versions to Toronto-area Mac BBSes.\n\nAn Apple Canada employee, Mark Windrim, set up a FirstClass BBS in Toronto called MAGIC (the Macintosh Awareness Group in Canada). Local Mac users heard of the system and established accounts, quickly turning it into the largest Mac-oriented BBS system in the area. Having started with a single phone line and a tiny user base, MAGIC became a commercial entity called \"Magic\", eventually reached 6,000 users, and had 48 phone lines.\n\nDue to the multithreaded nature of the FirstClass client software, the user could open multiple messages at the same time, while uploading and downloading in the background. Whereas most systems indirectly encouraged users to simply \"leech\" files and then leave, users waiting for downloads on FirstClass had an entire modem channel free for uploading or writing.\n\nSoftArc sought to take advantage of the growing interest by offering reduced prices to BBS operators. During this time, some FirstClass BBS systems mushroomed to thousands of users, including the Boston Computer Society (BCS), which was the largest computer club of that era; the Virginia-based DigitalNation, which had hoped to become an AOL competitor; the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group's Planet BMUG; the BendNet BBS in Bend, Oregon; and Virtual Valley services operated by Silicon Valley's Metro Newspapers group. Another notable system was the Great Lakes Free-Net, billed as \"the world's first graphical Free-Net,\" based in Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\nThe FirstClass software later incorporated a feature that allowed individual FirstClass sites to share conference content and private mail by allowing the servers to link together. Originally this was accomplished via dialup connections, but eventually allowed sites to link via the internet using internet connections. Apple employee Scott Converse formed the first and probably the most extensive network of FirstClass-based sites in the world, known as OneNet.\n\nBy 1994, the internet was becoming a major force, obsoleting most BBS systems on both Mac and Windows over the next year or so.\n\nBy the mid 1990s FirstClass had evolved into a small-to-medium-sized internal e-mail system, but its BBS continued to receive attention. A FirstClass client for Microsoft Windows was introduced, along with a Windows NT-based server.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s FirstClass evolved to compete in the groupware marketplace. The product was successful to some degree, besting Microsoft Exchange in number of installed users until 1997.\n\nFirstClass added internet functionality and a scripting method by 2000 but both Lotus and Microsoft had introduced these features earlier and FirstClass lost market share to them. The Mac market simultaneously declined through the mid to late 1990s, eroding the product's primary customer base. Even among those organizations that considered using the FirstClass system, the lack of a robust calendaring component during this time (until FirstClass version 6 in 2001) was an obvious flaw. Nevertheless, FirstClass was recognized as a notable (though not top) vendor of worldwide integrated collaborative environments by International Data Corporation in 2004.\n\nDuring this period FirstClass added a voice mail solution integrated with the server. The feature, commonly known as unified messaging, allowed users to receive voice, fax and e-mail in their mailbox.\n\nIn 2007 with the release of version 9, FirstClass redesigned its interface and introduced an automatic server-based and policy-driven archiving service for legal compliance purposes, and full Unicode support.\n\nBy the end of 2010, version 11 was released, with mobile clients for Apple iOS, Android and Blackberry made available during 2011. IMAP mail and RSS support was added in version 11.1 in 2012.\n\nFirstClass Application Services or \"FCAS\" (formerly called \"RAD\" for \"Rapid Application Development\") allows third-party developers to create tools and applications for use with FirstClass. The BASIC-like language is documented in the FirstClass client's online Help, under \"Customization Tools, FCAS, Language Reference\".\n\nWith the release of FirstClass 12, FirstClass introduces a fully supported and documented Application Programming Interface (API) that will allow web developers to retrieve authenticated secure information from their FirstClass Collaborative system, and display it within their own web site. FirstClass API \n\nIn 1999 the company arranged a reverse takeover by a company from Vancouver to become listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as Centrinity. In September 2002 OpenText bought Centrinity, for a reported C$1.26 per share or C$19 million. OpenText was developing a suite of online collaboration products through a series of mergers, and FirstClass's educational background seemed to fit particularly well with some of their other offerings. At the time OpenText stated their intention to integrate FirstClass into the \"LiveLink\" internet information collection engine, but this integration has not yet happened and is rumored to be not practical due to the architecture of LiveLink.\n\nAs of March 31, 2010, the original founders of the FirstClass product and company (Steve Asbury, Jon Asbury, and Scott Welch) and two longtime employees (John Myers and Barry Carter) are no longer employed by OpenText; the only reason given was a difference of opinions in the future direction of the FirstClass product and other derivative products. They have since developed Edsby, a product that blends social media and classroom management tools.\n\nThe next year would see many other key team members voluntarily move on to new challenges. Among those departing were the UX designers behind FirstClass' rebirth as OpenText Social Media: one for Research In Motion, the other to start his own company. In June and August 2011, there were two more rounds of layoffs. Long-time employees Paul Whittemore, Desmond Ong, and Julie Oke, along with several others, asked to be included. Senior managers Terry Whyte and Dave Wormald left over the course of the summer.\n\nOpenText continues to develop the FirstClass software suite which has been opened up to support external \"Apps\".\n\nAs free offerings from Google Apps for Education and Office 365 for Education have become increasingly popular and functional, the traditional paid product that FirstClass offers has apparently become more difficult to justify in educational environments.\n\n\n"}

The field *R includes, in particular, infinitesimal (\"infinitely small\") numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical justification for their use. Roughly speaking, the idea is to express analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well to *R. This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level, the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to internal sets rather than to all sets (note that the term \"language\" is used in a loose sense in the above).\n\nEdward Nelson's internal set theory is an axiomatic approach to nonstandard analysis (see also Palmgren at constructive nonstandard analysis). Conventional infinitary accounts of nonstandard analysis also use the concept of internal sets.\n\nRelative to the ultrapower construction of the hyperreal numbers as equivalence classes of sequences formula_1, an internal subset [\"A\"] of *R is one defined by a sequence of real sets formula_2, where a hyperreal formula_3 is said to belong to the set formula_4 if and only if the set of indices n such that formula_5, is a member of the ultrafilter used in the construction of *R.\n\nMore generally, an internal entity is a member of the natural extension of a real entity. Thus, every element of *R is internal; a subset of *R is internal if and only if it is a member of the natural extension formula_6 of the power set formula_7 of R; etc.\n\nEvery internal subset of formula_8 is necessarily \"finite\", (e.g. has no infinite elements, but can have infinitely many elements; see Theorem 3.9.1 Goldblatt, 1998). In other words, every internal infinite subset of the hyperreals necessarily contains nonstandard elements.\n\n\n"}

It is owned by SummitMedia. KQCH's studios are located on Mockingbird Drive in South Omaha, while its transmitter is located off North 72nd Avenue and Crown Point at the Omaha master antenna farm.\n\nKQCH's origins began on May 21, 1999, when it flipped from Adult Contemporary to Rhythmic Contemporary as \"Channel 97.7\". The station became a serious challenger to Top 40 Mainstream KQKQ-FM during its three years on the 97.7 frequency.\n\nThe 94.1 frequency was originally KOAD, owned by the Omaha World-Herald, and launched on 94.3 FM in 1941. This lasted until 1949, when it moved to 94.1 and went silent. In 1959, it returned to the air as KMEO, where it had a MOR format until 1968, when it became AOR KOWH-FM. By 1979, KOWH-FM switched formats to R&B as KYNN-FM under then-new owner Great Empire Broadcasting, lasting until 1982, when it flipped to country. In September 1983, it became WOW-FM and retained the country format, where it enjoyed a successful 17-year run. Journal Broadcasting would buy out Great Empire in 1999. On October 10, 2000, WOW-FM changed its call letters and re-branded to KSSO, \"Kiss Country\", which prompted a cease and desist letter from Clear Channel Communications – who had previously trademarked and service-marked the \"Kiss\" name and had recently launched a \"Kiss\" station in nearby Lincoln, Nebraska. A couple of months later, they modified the call letters and became KMXM \"Max Country\" on January 2, 2001.\n\nOn May 3, 2002, at Noon, Journal Broadcasting moved KQCH and its rhythmic-leaning Top 40 format from 97.7 to 94.1 and was relaunched as \"Channel 94.1\". The station continued in a Rhythmic direction until 2004, when it shifted to a more mainstream (and slightly adult-leaning) direction after KQKQ flipped to Adult Top 40. KQCH currently has competition with KOPW, who ironically happens to be a Rhythmic and KQKQ's sister station. In early September 2012, KQCH received direct competition when iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel)'s KQBW flipped to Top 40.\n\nJournal Communications and the E. W. Scripps Company announced on July 30, 2014 that the two companies would merge to create a new broadcast company under the E. W. Scripps Company name that owned the two companies' broadcast properties, including KQCH. The transaction was completed in 2015. Scripps exited radio in 2018; the Omaha stations went to SummitMedia in a four-market, $47 million deal completed on November 1, 2018.\n\n"}

He then chose Shukaku as his Honinbō name. He is one of the few Honorary Honinbos. He was known for having a healthy rivalry with Sakata Eio. This could be seen as Sakata would constantly beat Takagawa from 1959 to 1966 in the finals of major tournaments.\n\nTakagawa's books, translated from their original Japanese, were instrumental in educating Westerners in the ways of Go. He also wrote a series of articles from 1961 through 1977 for the Nihon Ki-in which was the primary English source of information about Go during that period. These articles were later compiled into \"Improve Your Intuition\", still considered a valuable guide for Go players.\n\nSakata Eio was known to talk about Takagawa's style of play. He included him in his book \"Killer Of Go\", saying he'd drag out his games so they'd be longer and then his opponent would lose their edge. He was so very cool and collected during games, that he would never tense up before a match. This could be seen when he strolled to many Honinbō title wins.

{"id": "2190778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190778", "title": "Mamadou Dia", "text": "Mamadou Dia\n\nMamadou Dia (18 July 1910 – 25 January 2009) was a Senegalese politician who served as the first Prime Minister of Senegal from 1957 until 1962, when he was forced to resign and was subsequently imprisoned amidst allegations that he was planning to stage a military coup to overthrow President Léopold Sédar Senghor.\n\nOf rural origin, Mamadou Dia was born in Khombole, in the Thies Region of Senegal, on 18 July 1910. His father, a veteran turned into a policeman, played a key role in transmitting him faith to Sufi Islam and was an important example of rectitude.\n\nFormer pupil of the Blanchot elementary school in Saint-Louis, began his education in a Quranic school to later move into western education at the \"École William Ponty,\"principal training ground of the elite in French Africa in the 20s and 30s. Eventually, he persuaded graduate studies in economics at the University of Paris. Before entering politics (became motivated to so only after Vichy regime collapsed) in the early 1940s, he worked as journalist, teacher and school director.\n\nIn his book \"“Africa, the price of freedom”\" (2001, edited by L'Harmattan) he stated to believe to be actually born (according to some papers belonging to his father he had found) in July 1911.  It has been a teacher who made him one year older on official documents to allow him to pass the competition for the William Ponty school, as otherwise he would have been too young to candidate.\n\nDia started life in politics in 1947 as a leader in the Grand Council of the Afrique occidentale française (AOF) and as Secretary General of the Senegalese Democratic Bloc (BDS) from the following year. He served in the French Senate from 1948 to 1956 and as deputy in the French National Assembly from 1956 to 1958, sitting with the parliamentary group of Overseas Independent (IOM). With Senghor, Dia formed the African Convention Party (PCA) in January 1957 from the BDS. When Charles de Gaulle proposed a referendum on the French community in 1958, the two leaders stand by two opposite positions: Dia is in favor of a break with France, while Senghor wants to keep Senegal in the community,\n\nDuring his two terms as a senator, Mamadou Dia voted for the ratification of the Atlantic Pact (July 28, 1949), voted for the law Marie favorable to private education (September 12), and declared himself in favor of the ratification of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (1 st April 1952). On March 26, 1955, he opposed plans relating to the WEU, the end of the occupation in Germany, its entry into NATO and the Saar Agreement. It approved the draft law on state of emergency in Algeria (1 st April) and abstained on the draft electoral reform restoring the district election (15 November). He was also an active member of parliament, being a frequent speaker and devoting himself to the problems of the overseas territories.\n\nDia was one of the main figures (namely vice-president) of the abortive Mali Federation of Senegal and French Sudan (later Mali) until its collapse. Once independence has been proclaimed on August 20, 1960, he became Prime minister, in tandem with Senghor as President of the Republic of Senegal who, as a Catholic in a largely Islamic country, valued having a widely connected and able Muslim as his deputy. His time served as Prime Minister was often controversial and his radical socialist views often clashed with those of the more moderate Senghor.\n\nAfter slightly more than two years of legislature, Mamadou Dia was at the center of his country's first major post-independence crisis in December 1962, when he unsuccessfully attempted to stage a constitutional coup against Senghor. It was taken at the time as a classic example of the difficulties of power sharing in new-born states: Dia embodied the summit of the State in a two-headed parliamentary system (economic and internal policy for him, foreign policy for the President).\n\nHowever, different views with regards to the economy, played a major role: there was a serious liberal versus radical policy divide. In fact, Dia began to implement some of the radical ideas he had articulated in his book Réflexions sur l'Économie de l'Afrique Noire (1960), which rose concern among the Marabouts, the powerful religious leaders who controlled the groundnut business, and runs counter to French interests.\n\nAs result of the grave power struggle between the two former political allies, a group of dissident parliamentarians motivated by Senghor, tabled a motion of no confidence against the government, thus on Dia. He responded by invoking executive powers and ordering the army to lock the assembly building before the vote could be taken. Senghor charged it as an attempted coup, in turn calling out the army, which was in the majority loyal to him. Dia and several of his ministers were arrested and tried for treason. Eventually, he was forced to resign and subsequently imprisoned (initially sentenced to life in prison) in the eastern town of Kédougou, until 1974, but later pardoned (1974) and given amnesty (1976).\n\nHis political power may have been broken but not his spirit. Dia attempted to restart his career in the early 1980s, once multiparty democracy had been introduced by Abdou Douf, but the small party he led (the People Democratic Movement) found little support. Thus, he never returned to a position of power; however, he remained an iconic figure in Senegalese politics, retaining an intellectual and moral place in the country. He accompanied the Senegalese state during the years of decolonization and remained one of the main figures in the construction of modern Senegal. He gradually acquired the role of national treasure, as he continued regularly to write diatribes in the local press well into his 90s. He was noted for his attacks on the neo-liberal economic policies of the current president, Abdoulaye Wade, who ironically had been one of the lawyers who defended Dia in 1963. After his death on the 25th January 2009 (at the age of 98, in Dakar), there was a massive outpouring of sentiment in national newspapers due to admiration for his obdurate attachment to principles.\n\n\"Dia ne s’est jamais defait de son idealism pour devenir un homme d’Etat\"\n\nWhen Leopold Senghor (Catholic) and Mamadou Dia (Muslim) led Senegal to independence they had very clear ideas of what ideological and philosophical values would have formed the basis of the new State. African socialism, spirituality and secularisms were the concepts to guide the country towards modernity and development with a spirit of tolerance and pluralism to define their project. The two figures were both fundamentally convinced, on the one hand, of the necessity of a secular state, and on the other, that religious fervor is a cultural energy essential for achieving modernization. And that is why they charged themselves and their fellow nation builders, the institutions, the party and especially the political discourse with the mission of realizing the ideal of a nation uplifted by the spirit, committed to secularism and thus, ultimately, prosperous.\n\nDia’s reflection on Islam (like those contained in his \"Islam, African Societies and Industrial Culture\") are useful to understand the degree of faith he had in this spiritualist socialism as motivating force of development in Senegal.\n\n\"“Islam must remind the Muslim world […] that if it is required to act, it is so that one may fulfill oneself, that one may achieve even richer being. For industrial development to be a boon and not the ruin of mankind, it is crucial that it retain a human dimension, that it not give rise to a new kind of slavery under the pretense  of promoting productivity or efficacy, that it not create progress that is in reality perversion, desire of well-being and not of better-being […]”\"\n\nIt is the philosophy of a modern Islam actively participating in a process of transformation of itself and of the world in conformity with demands of justice.\n\nThis interpretation of secularization put Senegal out of the heir of France (where takes the form of a permanent hostility to any manifestation of religion) and more in Anglo-Saxon model of relation between church and State: aim to guarantee the autonomy of religious communities.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality happened to be different from the initial project as Senghor and Dia had to partially renounce to their ideas and had to accept a compromise pact to assure the support, especially during elections, of the marabouts (which thus became an integral part of the political life). Eventually, the demarcation between religion and politics was more blurred than what they initially hoped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Chester (born Harold Ribotsky; March 6, 1921 in Brooklyn, New York – March 25, 2012 in London), was an American film producer, writer, director, and former juvenile actor.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York City, he was the youngest of seven children born to affluent Polish-Jewish immigrants; his father was a property developer. After the Wall Street Crash, he took up work as a magician's assistant to help the family finances.\n\nOriginally credited as \"Hally Chester\" in theater productions (taking the surname of his step-mother), he appeared in the premiere production of \"Dead End\" by Sidney Kingsley on Broadway at the age of 14. Playing the part of Dippy, one of the gang of kids soon known as The Dead End Kids, he toured in this play for 22 weeks, before accepting an offer to appear in the sequel to the film version \"Crime School\" (1938) for Warner Bros which had Humphrey Bogart cast in one of the leading roles. As a teen actor, his most regular work was with the \"Little Tough Guys\" series for Universal, appearing also in \"Juvenile Court\" (1938) for Columbia, in which Rita Hayworth appears, and the \"East Side Kids\" for Monogram Pictures. His last appearance in this series was in \"Sea Raiders\" (1941).\n\nHal E. Chester, as he was now known, managed to convince Monogram to place him on contract as a producer in 1945. Meanwhile, he entered into an agreement with comic strip writer/cartoonist Ham Fisher, creator of the \"Joe Palooka\" comic strip cartoon character. Between 1946 and 1951, Chester, as producer, was responsible for a series of what became twelve Joe Palooka movies starring Joe Kirkwood, Jr beginning with \"Joe Palooka, Champ\" (1946).\n\nHe also produced \"Smart Woman\" (1948), \"The Underworld Story\" (1950), \"The Highwayman\" (1951), and \"Models Inc\" (1952). Working with stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen, he produced \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953), based on a Ray Bradbury story, in which a monster, created by the effects of atomic bomb tests terrorises Manhattan. From a budget of $250,000, its rentals totaled $5 million. \"Crashout\" (1955), a film about convicts on the run, followed. He co-wrote and produced \"The Bold and the Brave\" (1956) starring Nicole Maurey and Mickey Rooney, which led to Academy Award nominations for Rooney and the screenplay.\n\nAfter sailing to Britain on \"The Liberte\" in 1955 with his wife Virginia (née Wetherly) and two young sons, he was able to take advantage of tax laws intended to encourage international co-productions. The couple, who had married in 1948, soon had a third son soon afterwards. The family adapted so well to British life they set up permanent home in London, where Chester lived until he died. He produced \"The Weapon\" (1956) for Republic Pictures in a co-production deal. He co-wrote the screenplay and produced \"Night of the Demon\" (1957), which according to Martin Scorsese is \"one of the scariest films ever made\". Starring Dana Andrews and Peggy Cummins, it was directed by Jacques Tourneur. He followed it with \"The Two Headed Spy\" (1958) and \"School for Scoundrels\" (1960) with Terry-Thomas, Ian Carmichael, Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. This comedy, derived loosely from the books of Stephen Potter was a box-office success, but also the last hit of Chester's career.\n\nChester later produced \"His and Hers\" (1961), \"The Comedy Man\" (1964) and, along with Peter Stone and Frank Tarloff, co-wrote the screenplay for \"Father Goose\" (1964) starring Cary Grant. \"The Double Man\" (1967), a cold war spy thriller, features Yul Brynner and Britt Ekland in the leads while \"The Secret War of Harry Frigg\" (1968) stars Paul Newman. Chester's last film as producer was \"Take A Girl Like You\" (1970) directed by Jonathan Miller. It was based on the Kingsley Amis novel, adapted by George Melly and stars Hayley Mills and Oliver Reed.\n\nChester's second son died in a car accident in 1978, as did his grieving wife in 1980. In 2003, Hal E. Chester suffered a stroke which left him severely incapacitated and died in London, on March 25, 2012. For the remake of \"School for Scoundrels\" (2006) Chester was credited as an executive producer.\n"}

{"id": "2190792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190792", "title": "Independent Catholicism", "text": "Independent Catholicism\n\nIndependent Catholicism is a denominational movement of clergy and laity who self-identify as Catholic (most often as Old Catholic and/or as Independent Catholic) and form \"micro-churches claiming apostolic succession and valid sacraments\", in spite of not being affiliated to the historic Catholic churches such as the Roman Catholic and Old Catholic churches. The term \"Independent Catholic\" derives from the fact that \"these denominations affirm both their belonging to the Catholic tradition as well as their independence from Rome.\"\n\nIt is difficult to determine the number of jurisdictions, communities, clergy and members who make up Independent Catholicism, particularly since the movement \"is growing and changing in every moment.\" Some adherents choose Independent Catholicism as an alternative way to live and express their Catholic faith outside the Roman Catholic Church (with whose structures, beliefs and practices Independent Catholicism often closely aligns) while rejecting some traditional Catholic teachings.\n\nIndependent Catholicism may be considered part of a larger Independent Sacramental Movement, in which clergy and laity of various faith traditions –including the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion and various non-Catholic Christian churches–have separated themselves from the institutions with which they previously identified. Within the Independent Sacramental Movement, various independent churches have sprung from the Eastern Orthodox Church, but the members of these independent Orthodox groups most often self-identify as Independent Orthodox and not as Independent Catholic.\n\nBeginning in 1724, Dominique Marie Varlet (1678-1742), the Roman Catholic Bishop of Babylon, consecrated four successive men as Archbishop of Utrecht without papal approval. The cathedral chapter of Utrecht, which elected these men, had previously obtained an opinion from Zeger Bernhard van Espen (1646-1728) and two other doctors of canon law at the University of Louvain, which said that the chapter had the right, in special circumstances, to elect its own archbishop and have him consecrated without the consent of the pope, and that, in the case of necessity, one bishop alone might validly consecrate another. Nineteen doctors of the theological faculties at Paris, Nantes, Rheims and Padua approved of this opinion. This consecration by Varlet caused a theological controversy and schism within the Roman Church, which now possessed bishops who were validly consecrated without the permission of the pope. This schism marked the birth of the movement that would later be known as the Old Catholic Church (a term coined in 1853 for the Catholics of Utrecht), and it marked the beginning of an era in the Western Church, in which validly-consecrated bishops enjoyed apostolic succession but were not subject to the structures and strictures of the Roman church.\n\nThe sharing of apostolic succession in the west outside the Roman church was largely confined to the Church of Utrecht for over a century. After the (First) Vatican Council in 1870, many Austro-Hungarian, German and Swiss Catholics rejected assertions of universal jurisdiction of the pope and the declaration of papal infallibility, and their bishops, inspired by earlier acts in Utrecht, decided to leave the Roman Catholic Church to form their own churches, independent of Rome. Now independent of the pope, these bishops were sometimes referred to as autocephalous (or self-governing) bishops or \"episcopi vaganti\" (wandering bishops). These validly-consecrated bishops enjoyed apostolic succession, and they continued to share valid lines of apostolic succession with the priests and deacons they ordained. In 1889, they formally united as part of the Utrecht Union of Churches (UU).\n\nIn 1908, the movement that would become Independent Catholicism left continental Europe when Arnold Harris Mathew (1852-1919), a former Catholic priest, was consecrated in Great Britain by Archbishop Gerardus Gul (1847-1920) of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands. Mathew believed that Old Catholicism might provide a home for disaffected Anglican clergy who reacted to Pope Leo XIII's declaration that Anglican orders were null and void, and Gul incorrectly believed that Mathew had a significant following in the United Kingdom. Two years later, in 1910, Mathew consecrated two priests to the episcopate, without clear reasons and without consulting the Archbishop of Utrecht, and, in response to the ensuing protest, declared his autonomy from the Old Catholic Church. Mathew later consecrated several other bishops who spread through England and North America. Plummer writes that, as a result, \"we begin to see the small, endlessly multiplying groups, with a high percentage of the membership in holy orders, which came to characterize the independent movement.\" From a historical perspective, one of Mathew's most important consecrations was of Frederick Samuel Willoughby, who in turn consecrated James Wedgwood, the co-founder in 1918 of the Liberal Catholic Church, an esoteric community closely aligned with the Theosophical Society and allowing complete freedom of belief.\n\nJoseph René Vilatte (1854-1929), an Old Catholic priest ordained by Bishop Eduard Herzog (1841-1924) of the Old Catholic Church in Switzerland, is credited with being the first person to bring to North America the movement that would result in Independent Catholicism. In 1892, Vilatte traveled to India, where he was consecrated, as Mar Timotheos, by Mar Julius I (1836-1923) of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. In 1915, Vilatte founded the American Catholic Church which still exists. During the following 28 years, Vilatte consecrated \"a number of men who are the episcopal ancestors of an enormous variety of descendants\" in North America.\n\nThe last century has seen a number of clergy and laity move into the Independent Catholic movement, from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nPerhaps the largest departure from the Roman church was the Czechoslovak Hussite Church (CHC), which organized on 8 January 1920, when several thousand priests and laypeople formed an independent church in response to their deep concerns over the Roman church's opposition to modernism. The church's first patriarch was Karel Farský (1880-1927), a modernist and former Catholic priest. The first bishops of the CHC were consecrated by priests through the laying on of hands. In 1931, (1880-1937), who was consecrated by Liberal Catholic bishop James Wedgwood (1883-1951), consecrated two CHC bishops, (1872-1942) and (1894-1946), thus sharing apostolic succession with the CHC. The CHC ordained its first woman priest in 1947, and it consecrated its first woman bishop in 1999. According to the 2011 Czech Republic census, 39,276 people at that time self-identified as members of the CHC.\n\nCarlos Duarte Costa (1888-1961) was a Roman Catholic bishop in Brazil for twenty years before distancing himself, and being excommunicated by the Roman church over his opposition to its position on clerical celibacy, divorce, vernacular liturgy, and his suspicions of the Roman church's fascist sympathies during World War II. In 1945, Duarte Costa founded the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church and began consecrating numerous bishops in the apostolic succession. He is known as \"St. Charles of Brazil\" by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, which had grown to 560,781 members by 2010.\n\nFrom 1975 until his death in 1984, exiled Roman Catholic Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục (1897-1984) of Huế, Vietnam, an older brother of Ngo Dinh Diem, the first president of South Vietnam, consecrated a number of bishops, first for the Palmarian Catholic Church, then for the sedevacantists of the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church. Thục also consecrated individuals unaffiliated to either of these groups such as Jean Laborie. In 1999, pop star Sinéad O'Connor was ordained a priest by Bishop Michael Cox (b. 1945) of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, whose lines of apostolic succession came through Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục.\n\nEmmanuel Milingo (b. 1930) served as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lusaka, Zambia from 1969 to 1983. As such, he enjoyed valid lines of apostolic succession from the Roman Catholic Church, and, after departing from the Roman Church in 1983 over the issues of faith healing and clerical celibacy, he formed Married Priests Now! and consecrated four married priests as bishops: George Stallings of Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation, Peter Paul Brennan of the Old Catholic Confederation, Archbishop Patrick Trujillo of the Old Catholic Church in America, and Archbishop Joseph Gouthro of the Catholic Apostolic Church International. Since 2006, Milingo has performed at least four other consecrations. In 2013, Milingo, who still considers himself Catholic, retired from active ministry in the Ecumenical Catholic Apostolic Church of Peace.\n\nUpon encountering Independent Catholicism for the first time, the questions of many individuals \"are often historical: 'Where did this come from? Who ordained you? Did you invent this?'\" Many Independent Catholics respond by emphasizing their tie to the larger Christian tradition of which they form part, the heritage they have received from larger, historic, mainstream churches, like the Roman Catholic Church, and their continuity of faith and ministry with those churches. Like Christians of the early Church, many see their efforts as \"the seeds of a new kind of ministry that can adapt itself to the time and place of its exercise, the needs of the moment, and the people who are actually present in that particular place at that particular time. And yet is it so new? Is it not perhaps the very way that St. Paul set about spreading the Gospel and building the Church?\"\n\nMany Independent Catholic communities look to the past, seeking to create communities according to models provided by the New Testament (e.g., home-based fellowships led by volunteer clergy) and restoring various practices of the primitive Church, including the creation of an inclusive community and the honoring of the place of women and other marginalized persons within those communities. Many also find benchmarks for their current work in the annals of Christian history (e.g., the living of religious life, the sharing of various spiritual traditions, or the celebration of the Tridentine liturgy).\n\nThere have been situations of clergy claiming to be \"Independent Catholic\" practicing scams against unwary persons. They use a victim's Catholic faith to assert they are legitimate priests who can counsel and perform sacraments. The Catholic and Old Catholic churches frequently find themselves in a position of having to warn parishioners of these scams.\n\nVirtually all members of the Independent Catholic movement possess \"a deep commitment to the catholic (in the broadest possible sense) sacramental tradition\" and worship according to a prescribed liturgy, usually derived from a mainstream Christian rite (like the Roman rite). Plummer suggests that \"the most critical factor for independent sacramental identity is the single-minded focus on sacramental activity...[and that] very few independent communities offer coffee hour, Sunday School, and the array of other social programs which have come to characterize many mainstream churches.\"\n\nLike the liturgies of early Christian community, the liturgies of Independent Catholic communities often vary widely, with each cleric or community making \"its own choices of emphasis in terms of doctrine, liturgy, and other matters.\" In practice, Independent Catholic polity is often essentially congregational.\n\nFor the most part, Independent Catholic communities possess a sacramental and eucharistic spirituality, often mirroring the sacramental life and theology of the Roman Catholic Church. Most possess a mediatory priesthood and an historic episcopate, which are often the only constants amid diversity that ranges from extreme traditionalism to radical experimentation. Julie Byrne comments: \"Independents vary widely, ranging from right to left in the political spectrum. On the right traditionalist churches practice versions of Catholicism more conservative than Rome. These include the Society of St. Pius X, founded by Marcel Lefebvre, as well as the Mount St. Michael's community in Spokane, Washington, and actor Mel Gibson's church in Malibu, California, which made headlines when he directed the movie, \"The Passion of the Christ\" in 2004. On the left stand groups such as the Church of Antioch, the Ecumenical Catholic Communion, and the White-Robed Monks of St. Benedict.\"\n\nWhile the western Church and its theology have remained constant, despite changing clergy, Independent Catholicism often possesses another model in which \"the priesthood remains constant, while the church it serves and the theology it teaches are often in a state of flux. While some western Christians may see this state of affairs as a distortion, it is nonetheless the centerpiece of the independent sacramental inheritance from the west.\"\n\nPlummer says: \"Independent sacramental Christians have given a unique primacy to the priesthood, carrying the 'priesthood of all believers' to an extent never before envisioned. In many such churches, most or all of the members are ordained, with ordination functioning more like [the sacrament of confirmation], rather than a professional credential. For better or worse, there is great freedom to create new church structures, new forms for the sacraments, and new theologies, or at least a new synthesis of inherited elements.\"\n\nMany Independent Catholic communities are small, are led by an unpaid clergy, and lack a stable schedule or location. Larger Independent Catholic communities have often resulted from schism within the Roman Catholic Church or are often led by clergy who were formed by and formerly ministered to the Roman church; these communities often resemble mainstream churches with a larger population of laity and a small number of paid clergy. In Independent Catholicism, freelance ministries meeting the needs of a small number of persons are far more common than large parishes.\n\nWhile many Independent Catholic clergy and communities affirm the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed, with or without the \"filioque\" and with varying interpretations, they espouse a variety of doctrines and beliefs, ranging from neo-gnostic and theosophical beliefs allowing for \"freedom in the interpretation of scriptures, creeds, and liturgies,\" or the belief in no creed at all, to extremely traditional orthodox Catholic positions. Plummer says: \"The nature of the movement makes it virtually impossible for there to ever be a unified theology\" among Independent Catholics.\n\nWithin the movement of Independent Catholicism, views vary widely on such issues as the ordination of women, homosexuality, divorce, issues of conscience, and other issues that are also controversial in other mainstream Catholic and Christian churches. Drawing from the ecumenical Christian tradition and other religious traditions, a growing number of Independent Catholic clergy and communities espouse a certain universalism, believing that God's loving embrace and forgiveness might be extended to all. Sometimes reaching beyond the bounds of the Christian tradition, some Independent Catholic clergy and communities feel greater liberty to incorporate into their lives and their worship a wide ranges of elements from other spiritual and religious traditions.\nIndependent Catholic communities, often being quite small, tend to be internally fairly homogeneous on these and other issues, which means that divisions more often exist between different Independent Catholic communities, rather than within specific Independent Catholic communities.\n\nPlummer suggests the following categories for Independent Catholic communities: clergy who primarily celebrate alone, traditionalists with conservative theological commitments, churches maintaining traditional liturgy but with a different social or theological vision (e.g., full inclusion), groups with a particular focus on women's issues (e.g., the ordination of women) or the recovery of the Divine Feminine in worship, groups seeking liberal, non-dogmatic approaches to being church with little, if any, standards of dogmatic beliefs, and fellowships with an esoteric spirituality.\n\nHundreds of websites are devoted to Independent Catholic jurisdictions and communities, some of which \"seem to exist primarily in cyberspace\". Others have no web presence at all.\n\nIndependent Catholic clergy do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church. Rather, the bishops of the Independent Catholic movement are autocephalous or self-governing. At present, there is no single unifying structure for the many clergy and laity who make up Independent Catholicism, and no reliable, centralized record-keeping.\nIndependent Catholic communities are often small and extremely fluid. Various directories of Independent Catholic clergy have been attempted through the years, much of the information is provided by subjects, often with little verification, and most such directories contain hardly more than the quickly-outdated contact information of individual clerics, with little information on jurisdictions, communities, apostolic succession, and forms of worship.\n\nThe notion of apostolic succession (i.e., the ability of a bishop to trace spiritual ancestry through a purportedly unbroken line of bishops back to the original faith established by Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles) has played an important role in the history of the western Church since the Donatist controversy in the fourth and fifth centuries AD. The traditional Catholic position holds that a validly consecrated bishop shares apostolic succession with the bishops he consecrates and the priests and deacons he ordains regardless of any heresy or schism he may have committed. Some theologians argue that this view is mechanical and reductionist, and that episcopal consecration is for service within a specific Christian community; in this view, consecration or ordination of an individual with no reference to a community is without effect. Independent Catholic clergy reject this view, arguing that bishops are consecrated and priests and deacons ordained for the service of others, whether of a defined community or jurisdiction, or of a more broadly defined group. Independent Catholics tend to share the view that, \"whatever else we may disagree about, we all believe earnestly in apostolic succession!\"\n\nMany in the Independent Catholic movement who say they possess valid lines of apostolic succession received them from lines derived from Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa, Roman Catholic Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngo Dihn Thuc or Roman Catholic Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, who are seen within the movement as having validly, even if illicitly, consecrated and ordained individuals outside the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWhile making no explicit statement about the validity or invalidity of consecrations and ordinations carried out in the Independent Catholic movement, the Roman Catholic Church suspended Roman Catholic Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngo Dihn Thuc, who had purportedly excommunicated himself by his \"latae sententiae\" act of consecrating other bishops and ordaining priests whom the Roman church will not recognize.\n\nBecause the claim of apostolic succession has traditionally been viewed as a primary determinant of the validity of certain sacraments, some Independent Catholic clergy, particularly in the early days of the movement, underwent more than one ordination or consecration in order to be certain of having valid lines of apostolic succession. According to liturgical theology, these lines of apostolic succession are shared by bishops with the persons consecrated or ordained by them and, due to the indelible nature of the sacrament of holy orders, once ordained or consecrated, a person can never be ordained or consecrated again; nor can the orders be taken away. Subsequent ordinations and consecrations are considered \"conditional\" and without effect unless the recipient has previously received no valid ordination or consecration.\n\nThese conditional consecrations and ordinations complicate conversations on the historical origins of the Independent Catholic movement and its communities. Plummer writes: \"Many independent bishops have been consecrated multiple times, in an effort to ensure sacramental validity and consolidate claims to the historic episcopate. Such consecrations, in which literally dozens of 'lineages' can be transmitted from one bishop to another, only increase the difficulty of accurately describing the ancestry of any given group.\" He says that this \"crossbreeding of ecclesiastical lineage\" has reached such a point that most Independent Catholic clergy share most or all of their heritage in common, even if this shared heritage has not contributed in any way toward jurisdictional unity.\n\nIndependent Catholicism comprises a wide variety of clergy, many of whom are \"primarily ritually focused\" and possess \"a particularly strong attachment to the liturgical aspect of being Christian.\"\n\nMany Independent Catholic clergy and their communities are \"those who have felt themselves excluded from the mainstream liturgical churches due to gender, sexuality, race, culture, style of worship...or theology.\" Plummer says that within the Independent Sacramental Movement, which includes Independent Catholicism, \"ordination is often open to a much larger percentage of the membership than in mainstream churches. Thus, those who want to become priests can generally do so. In the case of women and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons, there is a redemptive reversal in which those who were denied a public role in the church's sacramental life have assumed the previously forbidden place at the altar. Persons from ethnic or cultural minority groups who have been denied leadership positions, or who feel that their culture has been stifled, can work to more fully integrate their cultural identity and their faith...Thus, we have those who have been excluded from the church's sacramental life, for whatever reasons, taking ownership of the liturgical traditions, and creatively innovating to form new communities.\". Many Independent Catholics see this spirit of inclusiveness as being in line with St. Paul's vision of an inclusive community and with Jesus' reconciliation of all on the cross, with the subsequent rending of the Temple veil, thus granting access by \"all\" to the Holy of Holies. As a result, an increasing number of Independent Catholics find it difficult to justify how a church following in the footsteps of Jesus might justify withholding the sacrament of Holy Orders from women and sexual minorities, and the sacrament of Marriage from same-sex spouses.\n\nOutside of mainstream churches, Plummer says, such clergy \"have often been accused of 'playing church.' Perhaps there is a grain of truth in that barb, as there is a touch of a playful attitude, when all these unlikely folks process into the church's sanctuary.\"\n\nIndependent Catholic clergy have been described as \"often very attached to their individual views of theology, liturgy, and other matters...and would rather belong to minuscule groups which more closely approximate their vision of Christianity.\" Plummer shares: \"Many independent clergy, perhaps a majority, at least theoretically subscribe to fairly standard Catholic/Orthodox/Anglican theology, with few distinctive beyond, for instance, the rejection of papal infallibility. Most spent many years within those mainstream jurisdictions...[and now as independent Catholic clergy] they have often expended great energy in appearing 'real,' and 'just like' the larger liturgical churches, with only one or two adjustments.\"\n\nMany Independent Catholic clergy are \"essentially alone in their priestly practice\" and exercise a primarily solitary vocation, with many of their family members and friends not even knowing of their clerical status. In line with Jesus' command to pray to God in secret and with the monastic tradition of hermit priests (e.g., Catholic Carthusians) praying alone but in mystical union with the entire church and interceding for the entire world, much of their worship is performed in private. Plummer suggests: \"A growing number of clergy are comfortable with private celebration, when a community is not available, or if they have discerned that their vocation is largely a hidden one...Private celebration is often grounded in a deep conviction of the objective reality and efficacy of the sacraments. From such a perspective, even a mass said in one's living room unknown to any other soul, is still a radiant gift to the world, and a powerful prayer for those held in mind and heart. On a less exalted level, private masses for those without a community enforce one's priestly identity, which may be outwardly expressed in less obvious ways.\" Practically speaking, Plummer says, \"viable independent communities are not always easily created, and these clergy would deprive themselves of the benefits of communion, and of the joining of themselves to Christ in his sacrifice, if they waited for the presence of others in order to approach the altar.\" When engaged in ministry with others, Independent Catholic priests often see themselves as missionaries, freely sharing the grace of the Church's sacraments with those who may not regularly participate in a church community.\n\nOften volunteering their time in ministry, many Independent Catholic bishops, priests and deacons are a \"working clergy\" who support themselves and their ministries with jobs outside their ministries. As such, many often struggle to integrate their secular jobs and \"ordinary\" lives with their vocations and ministries.\n\nWhile all religious traditions contain examples of unhealthy individuals and of clergy misconduct, critics often draw attention to the personalities and idiosyncrasies of Independent Catholic clergy.\n\nSimilar to the Catholic Church, which possesses a rich tradition of varied religious orders, Independent Catholicism also consists of a diversity of religious communities. Most often, these communities and their jurisdictions resemble their Catholic counterparts. Some Independent Catholic religious communities are founded by and are exclusively for the members of particular jurisdictions; others are open to all who wish to live and grow in the spirituality of the religious community. Many religious communities within the Independent Catholic tradition are less structured than Catholic religious orders, with their members making certain vows (that may be interpreted differently than the traditional evangelical counsels), living a lifestyle in line with the spirituality of the tradition, and sharing the charism of their religious order with the world.\n\nApart from those members of the clergy who were formed within the seminary system of the Catholic Church or of a similar mainstream church, very few Independent Catholic clergy have received a formal theological education. Independent Catholic clergy \"are not usually specialized professionals, but volunteers who hopefully know at least enough to celebrate the sacraments for themselves and those around them...Such radically different models of Christian priesthood raise questions of what sort of clergy training is needed, and offered within these communities.\" Plummer shares interviewee feedback suggesting that \"the challenge of clergy training...was cited as the most important challenge facing the movement.\"\n\nResources for the formation and education of Independent Catholic clergy and seminarians are sparse, many Independent Catholic seminarians lack the financial and personal resources to be full-time seminarians, and many are not \"willing to go to such lengths, and incur such debt [for a graduate degree], with no prospect of paid ministry.\" Instead, many Independent Catholic seminarians work full-time at secular jobs and do not have the leisure to pursue full-time studies. Independent Catholic clergy have established a number of seminaries, most featuring distance learning or mentoring programs that vary considerably in quality, but very few of which grant legitimate degrees possess meaningful accreditation or could lead to a paycheck or a reasonably well-assured career path. More common is the mentoring and training of candidates by bishops and priests who have few if any clear guidelines or expectations for ordinands and instead adjust training requirements to meet the needs of the ordinand's vocation. Plummer concludes: \"Mentoring will likely continue to be the primary means of clergy training in the Independent Sacramental Movement, due in part to the extremely flexible, anarchic nature of the movement, which works against the creation of formalized seminary programs.\"\n\nThe grace of God in the sacrament of Holy Orders is often freely shared within Independent Catholicism, thus leading to such characterizations as that of the young and ministerially-unprepared teenager whom poet Robert Kelly (b. 1935) says he once was: \"A Unitarian I came into the world in Pride's Crossing, Massachusetts, and a Unitarian I shall leave it, notwithstanding my daily practice of certain Vedic sacrifices, my twenty-year long pursuit of ritual magic, the fact that I am technically a Muslim, and the more resplendent fact that I awoke from a teenage binge one day to find myself consecrated bishop of the Primitive Restored Old Catholic Church of North America.\" Plummer concludes: \"It is very difficult to know what to do about such untrained clergy. Some provide themselves the training they did not receive from their bishop, and serve admirably well, perhaps better than some of their formally educated peers. Others are walking disasters, spiraling into psychological distortions that injure themselves and others, or ignoring their ordained status altogether.\"\n\nIt has been pointed out that much of the writing (and liturgical books) concerning the Independent Catholic movement are self-published at best, and that they are often directed by Independent Catholic clergy toward other Independent Catholic clergy. It has been suggested that sustained theological reflection might one day come forward from clergy and communities with greater theological formation or from larger, more stable communities that have survived into their second or third generation. In the meantime, \"as Independent clergy are most often volunteers with secular jobs, and little formal theological training, they lack both the time and the tools helpful to the development of a fully imagined theology.\"\n\nAcademic literature on Independent Catholicism has historically been relatively sparse and often not sympathetic to the movement.\n\n\n\n"}

Ramsay revisits the restaurant a few months later to see how business has fared in his absence. Episodes from series one and two have been re-edited with additional new material as \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares Revisited\"; they featured Ramsay checking up on restaurants a year or more after he attended to them.\n\nAn American adaptation of this show, titled \"Kitchen Nightmares\", debuted 19 September 2007 on Fox. It is broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 as \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA\". Its run ended on 12 September 2014.\n\nIn October 2009 Ramsay announced that after his four-year contract expired in 2011 he would not continue with \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and would instead work on his other shows. In June 2014, however, Ramsay announced that the UK version would return for four episodes after a seven-year hiatus. The show has won BAFTA and Emmy awards.\n\nA one-off special entitled \"Ramsay's Great British Nightmare\" aired on Channel 4 on 30 January 2009 as part of 'The Great British Food Fight', a two-week series of food-related programming. In the programme, Ramsay campaigned for viewers to start supporting local restaurants, especially in a bad economy.\n\nIn June 2006, Ramsay won a High Court case against the \"Evening Standard\", which had alleged that scenes and the general condition of the restaurant had been faked for the first episode of \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\". These allegations followed reports from the previous owner of Bonapartes, Sue Ray. Ramsay was awarded £75,000 plus costs. Ramsay said at the time: \"I won't let people write anything they want to about me. We have never done anything in a cynical, fake way.\"\n\nThe programme received favourable reviews for its in-depth look into the restaurant industry. Jane Redfem of \"Off the Telly\" commented that the show \"could have been cynically designed to exploit Ramsay's foul-mouthed reputation... But watch, listen and think about what he is saying, and his genuine commitment to his profession in general, and the task at hand become abundantly evident.\" Lorna Martin of \"The Observer\" said \"\"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" is compulsive viewing – packed with excitement, emotion and entertainment.\"\n\"Slate's\" Sara Dickerman was impressed by the show's \"economic realism\" in the tired food television genre. She wrote, \"There is something refreshing about a show that doesn't promise a ticket to ride (a surgical makeover, a million dollars, Richard Branson's job) but instead offers restaurant owners the hope—if they seriously reform their establishments—that they might, just might, break even for the next few months.\"\n\n\"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" was named Best Feature at the 2005 and 2008 BAFTA awards. It also earned the 2006 International Emmy for best non-scripted entertainment.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, Acorn Media released season 1 of \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" on DVD in the US. Season 2 was released on 1 September 2009. \n\nFor the Canadian market, Visual Entertainment has released the first three seasons of \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" on DVD in two volume sets.\n\n"}

James starred in \"The Salt-N-Pepa Show\", a reality TV series focusing on reforming the group which aired on the VH1 network in 2008.\n\nThe daughter of a transit worker and Barbara James, a banker, James was born in Brooklyn, New York. The middle of three children, James grew up in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. James attended Grover Cleveland High School, graduating in 1983. After high school, James enrolled at Queensborough Community College to study nursing. James met Queens-native Sandra Denton in 1985 while attending college. James soon became close friends with Denton, eventually working together as telephone solicitors at Sears.\n\nAfter forming a friendship with Denton, James' then-boyfriend and co-worker Hurby Azor approached the pair and asked them to record a rap for a class project. With Azor's guidance as their manager, James and Denton then formed the group \"Super Nature\" (which eventually changed to \"Salt N' Pepa\") and were joined by Latoya Hanson who was replaced by Deidra Roper joined in 1987. They released five studio albums: \"Hot, Cool & Vicious\" (1986), \"A Salt with a Deadly Pepa\" (1988), \"Blacks' Magic\" (1990), \"Very Necessary\" (1993), and \"Brand New\" (1997). Salt also co-starred in the 1993 motion picture \"Who's the Man?\". In 1997, she recorded the song \"Stomp\" with gospel artists Kirk Franklin and God's Property for their album \"God's Property\", one of the best-selling albums in gospel music history. They were the first female rap act to have gold, platinum, and multi-platinum albums, and the first female rap act to win a Grammy. The group disbanded in 2002 but reformed in 2008.\n\nJames appeared on VH1's inaugural \"Hip Hop Honors\" program in November 2004, along with Pepa, but they did not perform. Salt, Pepa, and Spinderella, however, did perform on the second Hip Hop Honors on September 22, 2005, performing their hit \"Whatta Man\". This was the trio's first performance as Salt-N-Pepa since 1999. On October 23, 2008, Salt-N-Pepa performed \"Shoop\", \"Push It\", and \"Whatta Man\" at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards. In 2009, James was featured in the Generation Gospel Exclusive on 106 & Gospel.\n\nJames dated Salt N' Pepa group manager Hurby Azor during the early start of the group from 1984 until 1989. James married her husband Gavin Wray on Christmas Eve 2000, although they dated for ten years before the marriage. James and Wray have two children, a daughter Corin (b. 1991) and a son Chapele (b. 1999). They currently reside in New York City.

James' daughter Corin attended Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, New York.\n\nJames and her daughter are referenced in Tupac's song \"Keep Ya Head Up.\" In an interview James stated she considers herself a feminist \"in a way,\" emphasizing the need for women to avoid complete emotional and financial dependence on men. Songs like \"Tramp\" and \"Shake Your Thang\" by Salt-N-Pepa express such feminist themes as female autonomy. She was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church on a mission trip in Ethiopia with Oakwood College.\n\n\n"}

He began the 2006 season in the No. 92 Oak Gloves Chevrolet driving for Front Row Motorsports, however, he switched to the No. 34 Oak Gloves Chevrolet within the organization after two races. After another eight races, he yet again moved within FRM, this time to the recently acquired No. 61 team. Chaffin has currently made four of the fourteen races he has attempted, three in the No. 34 Oak Gloves Chevrolet and two cars with No. 61 team.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 season, Chaffin switched to the No. 37 R&J Racing car but was replaced by John Andretti before qualifying for a race. After Mike Bliss' resignation as the driver of the No. 49 BAM Racing Dodge on June 27, 2007, Chaffin was selected as one of the replacements with Larry Foyt. In his first attempt to qualify of the season at Loudon, Chaffin made the race after Brian Vickers and the No. 83 Team Red Bull Toyota were disqualified after failing post-qualifying inspection. In 2008, he attempted to qualify the No. 34 Chevrolet for Front Row Motorsports in the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono and the Camping World RV 400 at Dover, but failed to qualify in either.\n\nHis NASCAR career began in a 1993 Busch Series race at Rockingham. He drove three races in the No. 16 31-W Insulation Chevrolet with a best finish of 29th in his debut. In 1994, he again turned to the No. 16 and had a best finish of 20th in seven races. During 1997 he ran one race in the No. 87 BellSouth Mobility Chevrolet and posted a finish of 19th at Nashville. Again in 1998 he ran one race, this time in a family-owned No. 84 Logan's Roadhouse Ford, where he finished 28th. In 1999, Chaffin made nine starts, three with his family-owned team and six with No. 77 Lear Corporation Ford featuring Tony Hall as the owner. He had a best finish of 9th at Richmond.\n\nChaffin made 18 starts in 2000, all except for one in the No. 77 Lear Corporation Ford. He posted his best finish again at Richmond with an 11th place. In 2001, he drove for Team Rensi Motorsports and Day Enterprise Racing. Making 14 starts, he would have a best finish of 16th at Atlanta. 2002 is Chaffin's most active year in the Busch Series to date with 26 starts out of the 34 races. The majority of these starts came in the No. 16 31-W Insulation Chevrolet owned by Day Enterprise Racing. Although he struggled to finish many of the races because of mechanical failures he was able to achieve a best finish of 12th at Talladega. Chad was absent from the series for two years before returning for a race in 2005. He finished 36th in his only start during that year. For the 2006 season Chaffin was expected to compete in up to 15 events for Day Enterprise Racing in the No. 05 31-W Insulation Chevrolet, but ended up only making 2 starts for the team, then returned later in the year to make a single start for Sadler Bros. Racing. He has one career Top 10 finish in over 80 starts.\n\nChad first raced in the Craftsman Truck Series in 2000 with three teams. He raced the No. 84 Romeo Guest Associates Ford owned by Long Brothers Racing to his best finish of the season a 3rd at Nashville. He returned in 2001 and again raced with Long Brothers Racing and had a best finish of 4th. In 2002, he started only two races as well and was unable to finish either in a family-owned car. For the next two years he drove the No. 18 Dickies Dodge for Bobby Hamilton Racing and had two wins in 2004 (Dover International Speedway and Indianapolis Raceway Park). He finished a career-best 10th in the final points standings in 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn 2005, he drove for three teams and competed in 21 of the 25 races. Chaffin began the season in the No. 30 Germain Racing Toyota and had a best finish of fourth before bring replaced by Todd Bodine. Despite being replaced, Wyler Racing selected Chaffin as their driver and he ran 10 races with them placing 9th as his best finish. Jack Sprague then replaced Chaffin and he was left without a ride. He ran one final race in 2005 with No. 13 ThorSport Racing Chevrolet and finished 13th at Phoenix. For 2006, he was scheduled to drive the No. 40 Chevrolet for Key Motorsports in the opening races of the season, but has since left to focus on his Nextel Cup team. Ryan Moore, a Dale Earnhardt, Inc. development driver, has replaced him as of Charlotte. Chaffin made one start this season in the No. 02 Team Copaxone Chevrolet for Sutton Motorsports. It was announced on July 3 that Chaffin would drive the No. 59 Harris Trucking Ford for HT Motorsports after Steve Park's departure. In 2007 and 2008, Chaffin ran part-time in the No. 40 Chevrolet for Key Motorsports. In 22 combined starts, he earned two top 10 finishes.\n\nChaffin's only attempt in ARCA came in 2000 with his own Chaffin Motorsports. The No. 92 Upstate Helicopters Ford, which was a '97 Thunderbird, qualified third for Pro2Call 200 at Daytona. He exited the race after a transmission failure on lap 10, leaving him in the 40th position.\n"}

After winning the track championships at Thunderbird Raceway and later Winston Raceway, Sprague began racing in the NASCAR Winston Racing Series, in its North Carolina Late Model Division competition. He won the Big Ten Championship at Concord Motorsports Park, and won more than 30 Late Model Races. Eventually, he won the NASCAR Winston Racing Series championship at Concord Motorsports Park.\n\nSprague finished first in the inaugural race of the NASCAR Sportsman Division at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1989, but was disqualified in post-race inspection, giving the win to Tim Bender.\n\nSprague made his Busch Series debut in 1989 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Driving the No. 78 Griffin Racing Chevrolet, he qualified 28th but finished 41st after suffering engine failure early in the race. After a 40th-place finish at the Goody's 300 for Pucci & Associates, Sprague moved up to drive the No. 34 Keystone Beer-sponsored car for Frank Cicci Racing in 1990. He competed in nineteen races and had a best finish of sixth at Orange County Speedway. The following season, Sprague competed in seven races, driving the No. 48 Staff America-sponsored Oldsmobile. He won his first career pole at Charlotte. He continued to drive the car in 1992, where he had a second-place finish at New River Valley Speedway. He finished 24th in the final standings.\n\nIn 1993, Sprague signed to drive the No. 74 BACE Motorsports car. Despite four top-ten finishes, he was released with just a handful of races left in the year. He finished nineteenth in points. Sprague returned to the Winston Cup Series in 1994.\n\nSprague began racing in the Trucks' first year of competition in 1995. He began the season in the No. 31 Chevrolet Silverado for Griffin Racing, winning the pole at Louisville Speedway. After the Action Packed Racing Cards 150, Sprague switched to the No. 25 Budweiser-sponsored Chevy for Hendrick Motorsports. He ended the season with a pole at Phoenix International Raceway, and had three fourth-place finishes. In 1996, he slid over to the No. 24 Quaker State-sponsored truck owned by Hendrick, winning his first race at Phoenix, followed up by back-to-back victories at Nazareth Speedway and The Milwaukee Mile. With five wins total and two poles, Sprague lost the championship by 53 points. That season, he made his Winston Cup debut, running a pair of races in the No. 52 Pedigree Petfoods-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for Ken Schrader. He led two laps and finished 23rd in his debut at Phoenix, but wrecked the following week at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nThe following season, Sprague won at Phoenix, Nazareth, and Nashville Speedway USA, and won the championship. In addition, he returned to the Cup series, subbing for Ricky Craven at Bristol Motor Speedway, but finished 40th after a wreck. Despite winning the Truck Series championship, Quaker State did not return as Sprague's primary sponsor, forcing him to start the 1998 unsponsored. After a one-race deal with Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce at Portland Speedway, Sprague won The No Fear Challenge in his debut for sponsor GMAC, allowing them to join full-time as sponsor. He won five races total that season and finished second in points. He returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 40 Channellock-sponsored Chevy for Doug Taylor at Watkins Glen International, finishing sixth.\n\nIn 1999, Sprague won three races as well as the Craftsman Truck Series championship by eight points. He also drove at Watkins Glen in a Terry Labonte-owned car, finishing twelfth, and attempted the Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400 for Tyler Jet Motorsports, but failed to qualify. He won three more times in 2000, but crashes caused him to drop to fifth in the standings. In 2001, NetZero became his primary sponsor, and he won seven poles and four races, and took home his third championship trophy.\n\nAfter 2001, Sprague and teammate Ricky Hendrick moved back to the Busch Series, with Sprague driving the No. 24 NetZero Chevy. He won his first career Busch race at Nashville Superspeedway as well as leading the points during the season, before finishing fifth in the final standings. That same year, he ran the IROC series, finishing in the top-ten in all four events. He returned to Winston Cup to run a handful of races for Haas CNC Racing's No. 60 entry. His best finish was a 30th at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Haas switched to Pontiac and the No. 0 with a NetZero sponsorship for 2003, signing Sprague to compete for Winston Cup Rookie of the Year honors. Sprague's best finish that season was a fourteenth at the Daytona 500. After the Tropicana 400, Sprague was fired from the ride. He drove in two Truck races that year for Xpress Motorsports, finishing fifth in both events.\n\nSprague took over the 16 Xpress truck full-time in 2004, winning six poles and the UAW/GM Ohio 250. He finished seventh in points. The following season, he won at Texas Motor Speedway, but late in the season, was released in favor of Mike Bliss and took over at newly formed Wyler Racing for Chad Chaffin. Despite switching teams mid-season, he finished eighth in points.\n\nSprague finished the 2006 season fifth in points with two wins and two poles. He returned to the Con-Way Freight Tundra for the 2007 season. Sprague started the 2007 season in the Craftsman Truck Series with a win in the Chevy Silverado HD 250 at the Daytona International Speedway. However, Sprague began to struggle throughout the year, even dropping out of the top 10 in points. This, combined with Con-way's departure at the end of the season, led Sprague to leave Wyler for Kevin Harvick Incorporated where he drove the No. 2 American Commercial Lines Chevrolet. Late in the year, he left KHI to return to Wyler Racing.\n\nSprague remained on the sidelines throughout 2009 and 2010, into at least October 2011.\n\nSprague was rumored to return to the Trucks with Winfield Motorsports at Homestead. It was also rumored that Sprague had struck a deal with Randy Moss Motorsports to return to the series in 2012, though both deals apparently did not materialize as RMM's equipment was purchased by crew chief Richie Wauters to form his own team, Wauters Motorsports.\n\n"}

{"id": "2190868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190868", "title": "Woody Jenkins", "text": "Woody Jenkins\n\nLouis Elwood Jenkins, Jr., known as Woody Jenkins (born January 3, 1947), is a newspaper editor in Baton Rouge and Central City, Louisiana, who served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 2000 and waged three unsuccessful races for the United States Senate in 1978, 1980, and 1996.\n\nJenkins was born in the capital city of Baton Rouge to the late Louis E. \"Ory\" Jenkins, Sr., and the former Doris Laverne Rowlett (1922–2013), a native of Houston, Texas, who was reared in Shreveport and Alvin, Texas. Early in their married life, his parents operated a restaurant, Little Ory's Den in Ponchatoula in Tangipahoa Parish. Later Ory Jenkins was employed as an operator by Ethyl Corporation. Doris Jenkins worked in safety deposit at the American Bank on the Plank Road in Baton Rouge, a position from which she retired in 1982 after twenty-five years.\n\nHe attended Istrouma High School, where he served as student body president and was his 1965 class valedictorian. While in high school, he worked as a radio newsman at WLCS and in college as an announcer at WAFB-TV, the CBS affiliate in Baton Rouge. While at the Louisiana State University School of Journalism, he became the conservative columnist for the LSU student newspaper, \"The Daily Reveille\".\n\nAt age nineteen, while still in journalism school, Jenkins and his future wife, the former Diane Aker, who is a few days older than Jenkins, started a community weekly newspaper, the \"North Baton Rouge Journal\", which was honored by the Louisiana Press Association for editorial writing. Jenkins received a Bachelor of Arts in journalism from LSU in 1969 and a Juris Doctor degree from the Louisiana State University Law Center, where he was a member in 1972 of the \"Law Review\".\n\nJenkins owned an advertising agency from 1972 to 1981, when he became executive director of the Council for National Policy. From 1985 to 2005, he was president and general manager of WBTR-TV in Baton Rouge. Since 2005, he has served as editor of the \"Central City News\", a community weekly newspaper. At WBTR-TV, he produced a daily television news program from 1991 to 2005, \"Baton Rouge Today\", which won first place as the Best Community News Program in the nation from the Community Broadcasters Association. The \"Central City News\" has won more than twenty national and state awards from the National Newspaper Association and the Louisiana Press Association, including General Excellence, Best Feature Writing, Best Columnist, and Best Local News Coverage. Jenkins is an inductee of the LSU Journalism School Hall of Fame.\n\nJenkins had been a Young Republican in high school. At seventeen, he was a page for State Representatives Morley A. Hudson and Taylor W. O'Hearn, the first Republicans elected to the Louisiana House since Reconstruction. However, in 1971, he switched to the Democratic Party to run for a Baton Rouge-area seat in the state House. Even though Louisiana was becoming increasingly friendly to Republicans nationally, Democrats still fully dominated at the state level. At the time of Jenkins' election only two members of both houses of the legislature were Republicans.\n\nJenkins faced five older opponents in his first race but walked door to door and was elected with 67 percent in the Democratic primary and was unopposed in the general election. (Louisiana's nonpartisan blanket primary was not enacted until 1975.) He was sworn in at the age of twenty-four, just a few days before he graduated from LSU Law School.\n\nDuring his 28-year tenure in the Louisiana House from 1972 to 2000, Jenkins authored more than three hundred major bills that became law, including the Free Enterprise Education Act, which requires all high school students in Louisiana to complete a one-semester course on the free enterprise system; the Private Education Deregulation Act, which removed many regulations from private and Christian schools and legalized home schooling in the state. The Teacher Proficiency Act requires all new public school teachers in Louisiana to pass the National Teachers Examination; the TOPS scholarship program, under which more than 100,000 Louisiana students have been granted full college scholarships. Jenkins also sponsored the Concealed Carry Act and the Shoot the Burglar Act.\n\nWhile in the legislature, Jenkins organized and served as chairman of the Conservative Caucus in the state house, which had begun with only four members in 1972. By 1980, a caucus member, John Hainkel of New Orleans, was elected House Speaker. Jenkins served as chairman of the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations. Jenkins personally favored right-to-work legislation, but voted against a 1976 right-to-work bill signed into law by Governor Edwin Edwards due to the large number of union workers who lived in his House district.\n\nIn 1990, Jenkins helped to secure the override in the Louisiana House of Governor Buddy Roemer's veto of a ban on abortion, including cases of rape and incest and fines of up to $100,000 and ten years imprisonment on the practitioners. The legislation was authored by Democratic State Senator Mike Cross of Baker. Roemer declared the legislation incompatible with the United States Supreme Court decision \"Roe v. Wade\". His veto alienated large numbers of his socially conservative electoral base. Though the House overrode the veto, the state Senate failed to do so. Jenkins argued that the prohibition regarding rape and incest is needed to prevent women from filing false claims in such matters. State Senator Sydney B. Nelson of Shreveport, however, announced his opposition to the abortion ban championed by Cross and Jenkins because of the problems of unwanted children and defective births. Nevertheless, in 1991, United States District Judge Adrian G. Duplantier of New Orleans, a former state senator, ruled that the measure was in conflict with \"Roe v. Wade\".\n\nJenkins was elected as a delegate to Louisiana's state constitutional convention, which met from late 1972 to early 1974. His colleagues included fellow Representative R. Harmon Drew, Sr., future Governor Buddy Roemer and later Secretary of State and Insurance Commissioner James H. \"Jim\" Brown. He served on the convention's Committee on Bill of Rights and Elections, and he authored much of the new constitution's Declaration of Rights. The proposed constitution was approved by the delegates and ratified by the voters in a statewide election held in April 1974. Formally adopted in 1975, the document is still in effect.\n\nWhen Republicans failed to field candidates for the United States Senate in 1978 against the incumbent Democrat J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., and again in 1980 against Russell B. Long, Jenkins opposed both incumbents, himself running as a Democrat.\nIn a campaign appearance in Minden in Webster Parish, Jenkins vowed to secure funds for the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant, since closed, and Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City. He claimed that Johnston had voted \"too closely\" with proposals advanced by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. He questioned why Johnston had voted to divert intrastate natural gas from Louisiana industries to residential areas in such states as New York and Ohio.\n\nJenkins won twenty-eight of the sixty-four parishes, but Johnston prevailed, 58–42 percent. In the 1980 race, Jenkins criticized Long's support of the Panama Canal Treaties. He said Long was \"the most powerful man in the Senate, but he isn't using that power for us.\" Again, Jenkins lost, 59–41 percent. In both races, he was outspent by large margins, 5 to 1 in the Johnston race and 10 to 1 in the Long race. In the second of those campaigns, Republican Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, later his party's Majority Leader and presidential nominee, made a campaign commercial for his friend Russell Long. Coincidentally, Dole took over chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee from Long after the Republicans won a majority in the 1980 elections.\n\nIn 1972, Jenkins made an effort to promote the influence of conservative Democrats. He endorsed conservative Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles, California, for the party's presidential nomination, but the choice fell upon U.S. Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota. In 1976, he was elected as Louisiana's member of the Democratic National Platform Committee where he offered numerous conservative proposals during the meetings in Washington, D.C. He was the only member of the committee to vote against the final version of the platform.\n\nIn 1976, Jenkins and Dan Richey of Ferriday in Concordia Parish were the only House members to oppose the state appropriations bill, which passed 88-2. Richey stumped for Jenkins during his 1978 and 1980 U.S. Senate election runs, and Jenkins returned the favor by campaigning for Richey's election to the state Senate in 1979.\n\nIn early 1980, Jenkins was elected Democratic National Committeeman from Louisiana over the opposition of then outgoing Governor Edwin Edwards, but Jenkins resigned that position in October 1980 to campaign for Ronald W. Reagan for president, while Edwards stood with President Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn 1981, Jenkins and later U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish, one of the four parishes that Jenkins had carried in his 1980 Senate race against Russell Long, spoke at a rally in Alexandria. There the two endorsed proposed constitutional amendments to halt forced busing for the purpose of desegregating public schools and to require the election, instead of presidential appointment and U.S. Senate confirmation, of U.S. judges. Jenkins told the rally:\n\nWhat we need in America is a constitutional amendment against forced busing, and any American who says he is against busing and won't support a constitutional amendment is a liar.\n\nIn 1989, Jenkins joined a coalition of mostly supporters of Edwin Edwards to defeat a tax reform referendum designed by the Roemer administration to reduce sales taxes and state income taxes while raising property taxes. The successful opponents to the reform measure also included newly elected State Representative David Duke, former and later Speaker John Alario, and Victor Bussie, long-term president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO.\n\nIn 1994, after twenty-two years as a Democrat, Jenkins held a news conference with U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Democrat-turned-Republican, to announce his decision to change his party affiliation to Republican. Jenkins said that he felt conservatives no longer had any hope of influencing the direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 1996, Jenkins ran for the Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Bennett Johnston. Although five other Republicans ran against him in the nonpartisan blanket primary, Jenkins was endorsed as the party's \"official\" candidate at the Republican state convention. He also faced four Democrats and five independents. The field included Attorney General Richard Ieyoub, former Democratic state Treasurer Mary Landrieu of New Orleans, Congressman Jimmy Hayes (a recent convert to the GOP), former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke, and two wealthy businessmen, state Representative Chuck McMains of Baton Rouge and William \"Bill\" Linder of New Orleans, the brother of Republican U.S. Representative John Linder from Georgia.\n\nU.S. Representative Bob Livingston of New Orleans led the party as it rallied behind Jenkins. Support also came from Edward J. Steimel, former executive director of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Jenkins ran first in the primary with 27 percent of the vote. He and Landrieu then competed in the November general election. Former President George H. W. Bush came to campaign on Jenkins' behalf. He defended Jenkins against Democrat charges that Jenkins had personally benefited with rent and salaries from a charity which Jenkins headed. Other party figures supporting Jenkins were Senators John McCain of Arizona, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, and Connie Mack, III, of Florida. Governor Foster and former Governors David C. Treen, Buddy Roemer, and the Democrat former Governor Jimmie Davis all endorsed Jenkins too.\n\nOn Election Day, television network exit polls showed Jenkins leading, 51–49 percent. Jenkins' lead held up throughout the evening, but a late surge of votes from heavily Democratic New Orleans, as well as Bill Clinton's strong performance in the state, put Landrieu ahead by 5,788 votes out of 1.7 million cast.\n\nIt was the closest U.S. Senate race in the presidential election year of 1996, and one of the closest in Louisiana history. Jenkins carried thirty-eight parishes and exclusive of Orleans parish, he secured 53 percent of the vote. New Orleans gave Landrieu a 100,000 vote margin. The final returns showed Landrieu with 852,945 votes and Jenkins with 847,157 votes.\n\nJenkins led Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole by more than 134,000 votes statewide. Jenkins' vote total, as of 2004, was the third highest by a Republican running in a statewide race in Louisiana, topped since only by former Governor Foster and former U.S. Senator David Vitter.\n\nAfter losing this election, Jenkins contested the results. He claimed that at least 7,454 \"phantom votes\" were cast in 4,000 precincts in the state in 1996. The so-called phantom votes were alleged to have occurred when more votes were cast on the voting machines than voters who signed up to vote in that precinct on election day. Jenkins also claimed that more than thirty thousand signatures of voters on election day did not match their signatures on voter registration cards. Claims were also made that individuals were hauled multiple times to various precincts in New Orleans to cast votes without being required to sign the register. The Jenkins forces alleged that buses drove through the inner city and offered payments to anyone who would vote. Moreover, they claimed that further investigations proved that about 1,300 votes were cast by voters whose registered addresses were abandoned public housing units.\n\nJenkins took his case to the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate, claiming that Landrieu's 5,788-vote margin was made possible only by fraudulent votes in New Orleans. In a hearing before the Senate Rules Committee carried live on C-SPAN, Jenkins charged massive election fraud. He petitioned the Senate to unseat Landrieu and to order a new election – and on an 8–7 party-line vote the committee agreed to set up a probe.\n\nOnly a month into the probe, however, Democrats claimed that Thomas \"Papa Bear\" Miller, a detective hired by Jenkins' campaign to investigate claims of fraud, had coached witnesses to claim they had participated in election fraud. The Jenkins campaign denied the charge and declared it to be a Democratic attempt to distract attention from the massive vote-buying and election fraud they said had occurred in the election. Miller had several felony convictions on his record, including a guilty plea to attempted murder. Miller was killed in a drive- by shooting in May 2003. The Democrats walked out of the probe in protest, but the deliberations continued.\n\nIn October 1997, after a ten-month investigation, the committee allowed Landrieu's victory to stand. It concluded that while there were numerous irregularities, it was impossible to determine if they were egregious enough to change the outcome.\n\nIn 2004, Jenkins and Dan Richey, his long-term friend and former legislative colleague, helped to organize David Vitter's grassroots campaign, when Vitter, then a member of the U.S. House, became the first Republican elected from Louisiana to the United States Senate since Reconstruction.\n\nIn 1999, Jenkins ran for Commissioner of Elections against incumbent Democrat Jerry Fowler, whom Jenkins had alleged was part of the election fraud in 1996. Jenkins pledged to clean up elections in Louisiana and create a Voter Fraud Unit. In the primary, Jenkins ran first and fellow Republican Suzanne Haik Terrell finished in second place. Fowler ran third and was eliminated.\n\nIn the run-off between Jenkins and Terrell, the first statewide run-off between two Republicans in the history of Louisiana's open elections system, Terrell won handily. She took office and made many changes, including creation of a Voter Fraud Unit, which successfully prosecuted numerous cases of voter fraud.\n\nIn January 2000, Jenkins retired from the Louisiana House after twenty-eight years in office. In 2002, Suzanne Terrell was a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, matched against Landrieu, in a race that also included U.S. Representative John Cooksey of Monroe and State Representative Tony Perkins of Baton Rouge, Jenkins' 1996 campaign manager in the Senate race against Landrieu. Jenkins endorsed Perkins in the primary. In the runoff between Terrell and Landrieu, Jenkins endorsed Terrell, but Landrieu was elected to her second term.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, U.S. Representative Richard Hugh Baker, representing Louisiana's 6th congressional district, announced that he would soon resign from Congress. The political careers of Jenkins and Baker actually began on the same day thirty-four years earlier in 1972, when both were freshman Democratic members of the East Baton Rouge Parish state House delegation.\n\nBaker vacated his congressional seat on February 2. As a result, Governor Bobby Jindal called a special election to fill the vacancy. The Republican and Democratic primaries, again closed primaries, were held on March 8 in conjunction with the presidential primaries, with the runoff, if needed, set for April 5, and the general election on May 3.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, Jenkins announced his candidacy for the GOP nomination in the special election. Jenkins received the endorsements of Pat Toomey's Club for Growth Political Action Committee, and Dr. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family. He also received the endorsement of the East Baton Rouge Parish Republican Party. Jenkins later received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn the primary, he faced Paul Sawyer, Baker's congressional aide, Laurinda L. Calongne, president of Robert Rose Consulting; and Michael Cloonan, a veteran of the United States Navy from East Feliciana Parish.\n\nJenkins led in public opinion polls prior to the primary but fell eighty-four votes short of an outright majority to win the GOP nomination. Calongne, with 7,584 ballots (25 percent), finished second and forced Jenkins, with 14,849 votes (just under 50 percent), into a runoff. Sawyer trailed with 6,924 (23 percent). Cloonan held the critical balance of 425 votes (1 percent).\n\nIn the April 5 Republican runoff against Calongne, Jenkins won handily, taking 15,179 (62 percent) of the vote to Calongne's 9,327 (38 percent) votes. He faced Democratic State Representative Don Cazayoux of New Roads in the special election. Jenkins was immediately endorsed by Governor Jindal.\n\nIn Congress, Senator David Vitter and the three Republicans in Louisiana's House delegation – Jim McCrery, Rodney Alexander, and Charles Boustany endorsed Jenkins. Jenkins was also supported by House Minority Leader John Boehner, Minority Whip Roy Blunt, and Assistant Whip Eric Cantor. On April 25, former U.S. Senator John Breaux, now a resident of Maryland, endorsed Cazayoux on grounds that the self-styled \"John Breaux Democrat\" could work across party lines. In 1996, Breaux had also opposed Jenkins in the race against Mary Landrieu.\n\nDespite support from the state Republican establishment, some Republicans were cool toward Jenkins. Some considered him a second-tier candidate despite his long tenure in the state legislature, his near-victory in the Senate race a decade earlier, and support among social conservatives in the Louisiana GOP. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, reportedly tied his financial aid to meeting certain financial benchmarks, an unusual obstacle considering that the GOP had held this seat since 1975. Additionally, Jenkins faced potential problems from a past indirect connection to David Duke. Before the 1996 Senate general election, Jenkins' campaign retained a firm to do automated phone calls to voters. The firm had previously done work for Duke. He was fined $3,000 by the Federal Election Commission because the purchase was paid for by his ad agency instead of directly by the campaign. Later Jenkins learned that Duke received a commission from the firm he had hired, but Jenkins insisted that he had no knowledge that Duke would profit from the transaction. However, his signed agreement with the FEC admitted that he knew Duke had used the same firm.\n\nCazayoux won the special election on May 3, 2008, with 49,702 votes (49 percent) to Jenkins' 46,741 votes (46 percent). An independent Republican candidate and two minor candidates held the remaining 5 percent of the vote. Jenkins ran best in the City of Central, where he received 77 percent of the votes cast, and Livingston Parish, a heavily Republican suburban parish near Baton Rouge, where he received 72 percent. However, Cazayoux won by almost 5,000 votes in Jenkins' own East Baton Rouge Parish.\n\nJenkins was expected to seek a rematch against Cazayoux in the election for the full term in Congress in the fall of 2008 but announced instead that he would support Republican state Senator Bill Cassidy, who unseated Cazayoux and held the seat until 2014, when he defeated incumbent Mary Landrieu for the US Senate.\n\nIn private life, Jenkins has been active in efforts to assist refugees and poor people in Latin America. Jenkins has visited Latin America more than sixty times.\n\nJenkins served as CEO for WBTR-TV in Baton Rouge from 1987 to 2004. He was named to the LSU School of Journalism Hall of Fame in 1991; \"Legislator of the Year\" by the National Taxpayers Union, 1977, and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, 1990; 96 percent rating, Louisiana Association of Business and Industry; recipient, Winston Churchill Award, Council for National Policy, 1990; producer, \"Baton Rouge Today\", named \"Outstanding Local News Program in the U.S.\" by Community Broadcasters Association, 1992; named \"Louisiana's Pro-Family, Pro-Life Champion\" by Christian Coalition of Louisiana for his service in the legislature; listed in \"Who's Who in America\"; B.A., Journalism, Juris Doctor, LSU.\n\nJenkins and Daniel Duggan started a community weekly newspaper called the \"Central City News\" in 2005. In 2006, they started the \"Zachary Post\". In 2007, Duggan's company acquired the \"South Baton Rouge Journal\". Jenkins served as editor of all three papers. In 2008, Duggan and Jenkins dissolved their partnership, with Duggan assuming ownership of the \"Zachary Post\" and Jenkins ownership of the \"Central City News\". The \"South Baton Rouge Journal\" suspended publication. In 2012, Jenkins resumed the \"South Baton Rouge Journal\" under a new name, the \"Capital City News\". In 2010, the Louisiana Press Association awarded the \"Central City News\" first place in the state for General Excellence and in 2011, the LPA awarded Jenkins its Freedom of Information Award.\n\nOn May 18, 2008, Jenkins was elected as Louisiana's representative on the Platform Committee at the Republican National Convention, which met in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2012, he elected to a four-year term as Republican chairman for East Baton Rouge Parish.\n\nIn May 2012, small business owners in Baton Rouge formed the new Chamber of Commerce of East Baton Rouge Parish. The group is an affiliate of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Jenkins was elected chairman of the group.\n\nIn the Spring of 2020, Jenkins became a leading supporter of Pastor Tony Spell and Life Tabernacle Church in that church’s civil disobedience against Governor John Bel Edwards’ “Stay at Home” order in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Jenkins’ Central City News and St. George Leader began live-streaming services from Life Tabernacle Church in March of 2020. \n\n\n"}

He is married to former Craftsman Truck pit reporter Amy East, and brother-in-law to driver Bobby East. He is currently the spotter and driver coach for driver John Wes Townley and Athenian Motorsports, after serving as the competition director for Red Horse Racing.\n\nTerry Cook is the son of Harold Cook, a former driver and mechanic, and Laureen Cook. He also has a brother Jerry (not to be confused with the NASCAR Hall of Famer of the same name), who competed in a single Truck Series race and seven ARCA Racing Series events. The two brothers worked on father Harold's car as teenagers.\n\nCook graduated from Sylvania Northview High School in 1986, two years after his brother.\n\nCook began racing on a professional level in 1987 at Flat Rock Speedway and Toledo Speedway, collecting eleven wins in his first year of competition. Cook doubled his win total in 1988 before he moved up to super late models. He won the track championship in 1989 and 1990 at Flat Rock Speedway. Cook then went on to win the Super Late Model Championship at Toledo Speedway in 1992 and again at Sandusky Speedway in 1995.\n\nCook was set to make his NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series debut in 1995, but an injury at Toledo curtailed those plans. Cook made his Truck Series debut in 1996 at The Milwaukee Mile. Qualifying the #88 Sealmaster Racing (now ThorSport Racing) Chevrolet Silverado 24th, he finished 24th, three laps down. He ran two additional races that season for Sealmaster, finishing 23rd at Phoenix International Raceway. In 1997, Cook ran fifteen races during the season, with sponsorship from the PBA Tour. He won his first career pole at Flemington Speedway and posted a best finish of fifteenth twice.\n\nCook ran the full schedule in 1998. He won his first career race at Flemington and had six top-ten finishes, ending the season 20th in the final points. Due to a lack of primary sponsorship in 1999, Cook only posted three top-ten finishes before Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce came on board towards the end of the season, when he finished fifteenth in the standings. In 2000, PickupTruck.com became the team's primary sponsor, and despite seven top-tens, Cook was released with one race to go for Matt Crafton. He drove for K Automotive Racing at the season finale, finishing seventh. He drove K Automotive's #29 Ford F-150 full-time in 2001, winning the pole at Nazareth Speedway and finishing a career-high seventh in points.\nIn 2002, Cook won a career best four races and two poles, but dropped to eighth in points. He won an additional two poles in 2003, but did not finish in the top-five all season. He joined ppc Racing's fledgling truck team in 2004. Despite winning the pole at the season-opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250, he dropped to sixteenth in the standings. He moved up one spot in points in 2005 after posting two top-fives.\n\nIn 2006, Cook grabbed a win at Kansas Speedway and finished eighth in points. With no sponsorship at ppc, he left the team after the 2006 season to replace Chad Chaffin at HT Motorsports. He had four top tens and finished fourteenth in points, but was released at the end of the season. He signed to drive for Wyler Racing in 2008 and had an additional seven top-tens but was released before the season was over in favor of Jack Sprague. He immediately rejoined HT Motorsports for the remainder of the season. At the end of 2008, HT renumbered his truck to the #25, and Cajun Industries and Harris Trucking shared sponsorship duties of the truck. With two races to go in the season, Cook was released from HT. He drove the next race in the #02 Koma Unwind Chevy for Corrie Stott Racing, but was unable to find a ride for the season-ending Ford 200, ending a streak of 296 consecutive races started in the Truck Series.\n\nIn addition to his Truck Series efforts, Cook made several starts for MSRP Motorsports (now Phil Parsons Racing) in the Nationwide Series. In 2008, Cook ran 7 Nationwide races with MSRP, followed by twenty 2009 races, failed to qualify for three races. All of Cook's Nationwide starts were start-and-parks.\nCook was signed to drive the #46 Dodge in the Sprint Cup Series for the newly formed Whitney Motorsports in 2010. The cars were former Richard Petty Motorsports Dodges purchased after RPM's switch to Ford. Cook would run for Rookie of the Year against Kevin Conway. The team failed to make the first four races of 2010. Cook made a total of three starts in the #46 while failing to qualify for 7 races. He parted ways with Whitney Motorsports after Richmond. He attempted one race with Phoenix Racing but failed to qualify. \n\nIn 2010, Cook was hired as a drivers coach for Truck Series team Red Horse Racing, assisting driver Justin Lofton. Cook became the team's competition director in 2011, serving that position until 2014. In 2015, he was hired by Truck and Xfinity Series team Athenian Motorsports, serving as a driver coach and spotter for drivers John Wes Townley and Dylan Lupton.\n\nCook remains a popular figure in the garage area and among fans.\n\n"}

It airs an adult contemporary radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. The station has local DJs during the day and carries the syndicated Delilah show in the evening from Premiere Networks, an iHeart subsidiary. The station calls itself \"Kiss 98.1\", using a logo trademarked by iHeart, mostly associated with Top 40 stations that also call themselves \"KISS-FM.\".\n\nIts studios and offices are on East Sprague Avenue in Spokane. Its transmitter is also in Spokane, off South Krell Ridge Lane, on Krell Hill, also known as \"Tower Mountain.\" KISC broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD2 subchannel airs Country music as \"KIX 99.3.\"\n\nOn February 16, 1961, the station first signed on as KHQ-FM. It was the FM counterpart to AM 590 KHQ (now KQNT). The two radio stations, and Channel 6 KHQ-TV, were owned by \"The Spokesman-Review\", a daily newspaper in Spokane. At first, KHQ-FM simulcast the AM station, but it soon switched to an automated beautiful music format.\n\nIn the early 1970s, KHQ-FM flipped to a Top 40 format. At first, the contemporary version of KHQ-FM was also largely automated, but over time, DJs were added. In the 1970s, most radios were still not able to receive FM signals, and Spokane already had two popular Top 40 stations, AM 790 KJRB and AM 970 KREM (now KTTO). At first, KHQ-FM was not much of a factor in the ratings. But as more listeners acquired FM radios, the station's ratings improved. Eventually, the AM stations switched to other formats. \n\nIn 1985, KHQ Incorporated decided to keep its TV station but sold off the radio stations to Lilac City Broadcasting. In those days, call signs could not be shared if the different stations were not co-owned. KHQ-TV kept its call letters, while the radio stations switched. The AM station became KLSN and the FM station became KISC, known as \"Kiss-FM 98.\" In 1984, former album rock station 92.9 KREM-FM became Top 40 KZZU. KISC and KZZU were locked in a battle as Spokane's two big Top 40 outlets on FM.\n\nAs hard rock and rap music began to dominate the Top 40 charts, KISC shifted to Adult Top 40 and eventually to an upbeat Adult Contemporary format. KISC aired a popular locally based Love Notes request show like the Delilah love songs program they air today. In the 1990s, KISC would take pot shots at 99.9 KXLY-FM, which had made the transition from easy listening to soft adult contemporary. KISC accused KXLY-FM of playing too much \"soft sleepy music.\" When KXLY-FM flipped to Adult Alternative and then to Country music, KISC became Spokane's only mainstream adult contemporary station.\n\nIn March 2020, KISC's HD2 sub-channel dropped \"UP! 98.1 HD2\" and adopted the country format of KZFS and the \"Kix 99.3\" branding (the frequency being in reference to FM translator 99.3 K257FX, with KISC-HD2 now being the primary relay station for it). Subsequently, KZFS began simulcasting on new translator 101.5 K268DL and flipped to classic hip hop.\n\nIn 1996, KISC and AM 590, then called KAQQ, were bought by Triathlon Broadcasting. But Triathlon only controlled the stations for three years. \n\nIn 1999, ownership passed to AMFM Broadcasting. AMFM was later acquired by Clear Channel Communications, the forerunner to current owner iHeartMedia.\n"}
{"id": "2190884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190884", "title": "She's Lost Control", "text": "She's Lost Control\n\n\"She's Lost Control\" is a song by British post-punk band Joy Division. Released on their 1979 debut album, \"Unknown Pleasures\", \"She's Lost Control\" was first performed live by the band in June 1978 and draws primary lyrical inspiration from a young woman experiencing a violent epileptic seizure.\n\nTwo separate recordings of the song have been released: the version appearing on the band's debut album, and an extended, more electronic version was released in 1980 as a 12\" single. This 12\" single version contains an additional verse not present on the initial version of the song, and was recorded in March 1980 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, making this song one of the last studio recordings recorded by the band prior to the May 1980 suicide of their lead singer, Ian Curtis. On the US release of the 12\" single, \"She's Lost Control\" appeared as the A-side (with \"Atmosphere\" as the B-side), as opposed the UK version, where the song appeared as the B-side to \"Atmosphere\".\n\nCurtis primarily drew the lyrical inspiration for \"She's Lost Control\" from a young woman with whom he had become acquainted through his employment as an Assistant Disablement Resettlement Officer at a Macclesfield occupational rehabilitation centre between 1978 and 1979. The woman had epilepsy and had been desperate to find employment, yet she suffered seizures whenever she came to the exchange, which would greatly disturb Curtis. At one stage, this young woman ceased attending her appointments at the occupational rehabilitation centre. Initially, Curtis assumed she had found a job, but he would later discover she had died of an epileptic seizure.\n\nHer unexpected death and Curtis's subsequent awareness and experiences of the stigma endured by individuals suffering from neurological impairments formed the lyrical inspiration for the song.\n\nThe composition of \"She's Lost Control\" centres upon Peter Hook's bassline, played high up on the neck, and a mechanistic drum beat played by Stephen Morris. For the song's recording, each drum was recorded completely separately, as producer Martin Hannett obsessively pursued clean drum sounds with no \"bleed through\" (when one drum's sound is added to the signal of another drum unintentionally) on songs he considered potential singles.\n\nLive, this song would be played at a faster pace than that upon the album, and much more aggressively, with Curtis often shouting the lyrics before the bridge sections. The syndrum used upon live performances of this song would often be more abrasive and louder in the mix than that used upon the studio recordings. On later live recordings, Curtis would play a keyboard line during the coda, one of only a few songs on which he would play an instrument.\n\nA number of live versions of the song appear on re-issues of the band's albums. In addition, the 2008 compilation release, \"The Best of Joy Division\", includes the Peel session the band had recorded of this song in January 1979.\n\nMany indie bands and artists have since covered \"She's Lost Control\". These artists include Girls Against Boys, Siobhan Fahey, Grace Jones and Spoek Mathambo. The guitar riff for \"She's Lost Control\" was also sampled in 1993 by the Manchester electronic music group 808 State for their single \"Contrique\".\n\nA very loose cover version of the song, recorded by the Greek minimal wave band Alive She Died, featured prominently in a 2015 advertising campaign for the cruise/resort collection of the Italian fashion house, Gucci.\n\nThe 2002 film \"24 Hour Party People\" includes a scene dramatizing the recording of the song, and suggests that Morris recorded the drum beat on the roof of the studio, as well as continuing to play the beat long after the other band members had left the studio.\n\nThe name of the song is referenced in the title of the 2007 Ian Curtis biopic \"Control\", which includes the incident which inspired the song, and also the actual recording of the song. This later scene depicts drummer Stephen Morris using an aerosol can sprayed into a microphone as percussion.\n\n"}

In fact, his brother Charley, has been a long-time crew chief in the NASCAR level. Pressley began running at New Asheville Speedway and Greenville-Pickens Speedway and won championships at both tracks. He also put together 150 wins in various Late Model Series in the Southeast. In 1984, Pressley made his NASCAR debut in the Busch Series at Charlotte Motor Speedway, finishing 26th. Five years later, Pressley ran a limited schedule in the Busch Series, and won in just his twelfth series start at Orange County Speedway. He ran full seasons from 1991–1994, his best year coming in 1992 when he won races and finished fifth in points. In 1994, he ran three races in the Winston Cup Series in a car sponsored by Manheim Auctions, his best finish being a 31st at Charlotte.\n\nIn 1990 Pressley was involved in Michael Waltrip's horrific Bristol crash in which he tapped Waltrip from behind, sending Waltrip's #30 Kool-Aid car into a fence, disintegrating the car on impact.\n\nIn 1995, Pressley took over for the retired Harry Gant in the #33 car owned by Leo Jackson Motorsports in Cup. He posted one top-ten finish and was runner-up to Ricky Craven for Rookie of the Year. The following year, he put together two top-five finishes. Unfortunately, Jackson was retiring and sold his operation to crew chief Andy Petree. After Pressley ran just one race for his new owner, he was released, but able to hook onto a ride with Diamond Ridge Motorsports. Pressley just ran ten races for Diamond Ridge in 1997, posting a best finish of 14th, when he was suddenly fired from the ride. While he waited for a Cup ride to appear, Pressley returned to the Busch ranks, running the No. 47 Chevrolet for ST Motorsports, and finished out the year with three top tens. Over in Cup, he joined the No. 77 Jasper Motorsports team, which became one of the more popular tandems in the Cup circuit among fans.\n\nFollowing his abbreviated Cup run in 1997, Pressley returned full-time in 1998 with the Jasper team, where he posted a then career-best third-place finish at Texas Motor Speedway. Despite being replaced temporarily by Hut Stricklin due to injuries, Pressley finished 32nd in points that year. 1999 was a struggle however, as Pressley and company failed to qualify six times that season, and often had trouble finishing races. Following the addition of Ryan Pemberton in 2000, Pressley was able to increase his position in points to 25th. In 2001, he had five top-tens, nearly won the inaugural Tropicana 400 before finishing in second, and finished 25th in points handing the driving duties to the car for the road course events to Boris Said. Robert Pressley, although competitive in some races, struggled with consistency, and would part ways with Jasper at the conclusion of the 2001 season.\n\nIn 2002 he had a one race deal with Melling Racing for the Daytona 500 and locked himself in by qualifying speed on Pole Day, Qualifying 5th overall with the same car they had qualified 3rd or better on the 2001 restrictor plate tracks. After receiving sponsorship from Brand Source he had an engine problem at the end of the race. When he blew up, his car was nearly destroyed on pit road as an accident happened on the tri-oval and Michael Waltrip's car came across onto pit road, also nearly hitting the pace car as well.\n\nAt the end of 2001, Pressley was released from Jasper, and he tackled on a new venture, the Craftsman Truck Series. He signed with Bobby Hamilton Racing and won his Truck Series debut at Daytona International Speedway. He also ran the season opening Daytona 500 in Cup for what was the last race for Melling Racing, finishing 22nd. In 2003, Pressley moved to HT Motorsports in the Trucks, finishing 12th in points. He returned to the Busch Series to drive the 47 again for ST Motorsports, finishing in the top-ten twice, before moving back to the trucks with HT in 2005, finishing 20th in the standings.\n\nHis son Coleman Pressley won the 2010 UARA-Stars championship and raced sporadically in NASCAR. He currently serves as Brad Keselowski's spotter.\n\nPressley served as promoter at the Kingsport (TN) Speedway from 2011-2014, moving the track to NASCAR Whelen All-American Series-sanctioned status beginning with his first season. Pressley also owns a restaurant in the Asheville, North Carolina area.\n\nIn 2016, Pressley was elected as a county commissioner in Buncombe County, North Carolina.\n\n"}

Crawford competed in the Craftsman Truck Series full-time from 1997 to 2009. He is the former promoter and manager of Mobile International Speedway.\n\nCrawford began his racing career as a short-track racer in the southeastern United States. He won the 1989 running of the prestigious annual short track Snowball Derby race. He also won the track championship at Five Flags Speedway in 1981 and 1984, and won the championship at Mobile International Speedway in 1981, 1982, and 1984. After that, he moved to the Slim Jim All Pro Series, where he collected sixty-one top tens, and earned five victories. In 1993 and 1994, he attempted four Winston Cup Series races in the No. 84, but did not qualify for any of them.\n\nIn 1997, Crawford moved to the Craftsman Truck Series with his Circle Bar team. He qualified for every race, had ten top-tens, a top 5 at Texas Motor Speedway and finished 12th in the points. He was also runner-up to Kenny Irwin, Jr. for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Rookie of the Year. The next season, he picked up his first career win at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Unfortunately, the team struggled to find consistency, with only five top-ten finishes and he dropped to eighteenth in the standings. Crawford started 1999 with two consecutive top-tens, but only wound up fourteenth in the points, scoring ten top-tens and four top fives.\n\nIn 2001, Crawford finished 8th in points, his first top-ten points finish, he would earn sixteen top tens and ten top fives. The 2002 season would prove to be Crawford's most successful to date, although winless for the season he had 17 top-ten finishes, a career high 12 top five finishes, two poles (at Dover and Phoenix), and finished second in the standings only 46 points behind champion Mike Bliss. 2003 saw him grab his second victory, at the Florida Dodge Dealers 250, in a memorable three-wide race to finish line at Daytona International Speedway. He finished the season seventh in points with 16 top tens and 10 top fives.\n\nIn 2004 in his first race after a massive crash at Atlanta Motor Speedway, in which Tina Gordon and Hank Parker, Jr. were also involved, he picked up a win at Martinsville Speedway. He would finish the season with 9 top tens and 4 top fives, and fell to 12th in points. Despite a win at Loudon in 2005, Crawford finished seventeenth in points, mainly due to missing the first race of his Truck career after suffering injuries, ironically while practicing for the Built Ford Tough 225. Boris Said, who was scheduled to be a guest on the Speed Channel's race coverage, was hired to drive the truck. While he wrecked later in the race, he returned to the booth to cover the rest of the race, as the late Neil Bonnett once did at Talladega Superspeedway in 1993 after taking a wild ride into the tri-oval. He did score two poles at Atlanta and Martinsville and had 11 top tens and 3 top fives.\n\nFor the 2006 season Crawford had five top-fives and thirteen top-ten finishes including a win on August 4 at O'Reilly Raceway Park, finishing 9th in the final standings, the win at O’Reilly was his final career victory. Rick had a consistent year in 2007 racking up 11 top 5 finishes, 18 top 10s and a near win at Mansfield Motorsports Park en route to a 5th place standing in the points championship. The eighteen top ten finishes would be a career high to date. In 2008 Crawford put together another solid season with thirteen top tens and seven top fives and a pole at Texas. He would end the season seventh in points. In 2009, now age 50, Crawford would again finish in the top ten in points at 10th. He scored seven top tens and three top fives and would win the pole at Martinsville for the second time in his career.\n\nCrawford would start the 2010 season with a great deal of uncertainty. Longtime sponsor Circle Bar Motel and RV Park would cut back their sponsorship of the team dramatically and Crawford stated that he was unsure how many races they would be able to run without a new sponsor. He would run the first four races of the season with Circle Bar, scoring two top tens. However, prior to Kansas Crawford announced that he would not race for Circle Bar in the #14 truck and would instead race in the Ray Hackett Racing #76 truck with sponsorship from SUPERSEAL Construction Products. This would be the first race in his record 327 Camping World Truck Series starts that he would not be in the #14 and would not be racing under Circle Bar Racing. Crawford would qualify for that race 15th and finish 31st after an accident going for the lead. In August, Crawford would take yet another unfamiliar step in his career as he would join forces with Tagsby Racing to race in the EnjoyIllinois.com 225 at Chicagoland Speedway. This would be the first race in his career that he would race in a Chevrolet truck. Crawford would earn his 3rd top ten finish in 6 races with an 8th-place finish in the race. He ran in two more races with Tagsby to close out the season.\n\nCrawford attempted to race with Tagsby Racing and make his 12th consecutive start in the season opening race at Daytona in 2011, but failed to qualify. Before 2011, Crawford was one of only 3 drivers to compete in all Camping World Truck Series races at Daytona.\n\nCrawford is a former manager and promoter of Mobile International Raceway, and attempted the 2012 season-opening race at Daytona with Tagsby Racing.\n\nCrawford holds the current record for most starts in the Camping World Truck Series. He raced in 210 consecutive races before missing the 2005 Built Ford Tough 225 race at Kentucky due to injuries sustained from a hard crash in practice. He had not missed a race since that date until failing to qualify at Daytona in February 2011. Prior to 2011, Crawford was one of the few drivers in the history of the sport with more than 50 starts who has never raced in any major series in NASCAR other than the Truck Series. However, that statistic was ended in 2011, when Crawford made his Nationwide Series debut driving for Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing at Chicagoland Speedway.\n\nOn March 2011 Crawford entered a multi-year contract to be the promoter and manager at Mobile International Speedway, his home track, in Irvington (Mobile), Alabama.\n\nIn March 2014 it was announced that Crawford would serve as crew chief for Team Stange Racing and driver Maryeve Dufault in the ARCA Racing Series.\n\nOn March 1, 2018, Crawford was arrested in Florida; he was charged for \"attempted enticement of a minor.\" He plans on pleading his innocence and was released into the custody of his family until his trial. Crawford was convicted by a jury on August 30, 2018. On November 26, 2018, Crawford was sentenced to 130 months in a federal prison. He was given BOP number 70138-018 and is serving time in FCI Beaumont.\n\n"}

{"id": "2190909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190909", "title": "Rich Bickle", "text": "Rich Bickle\n\nRichard Bickle Jr. (born May 13, 1961) is an American professional stock car racing driver. Now retired from NASCAR racing, Bickle, who never completed a full season in the NASCAR Cup Series, had a long history in short track racing. The \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" described him in 2012 as a \"stud on the short tracks in the late 1980s and early '90s and a journeyman who rarely caught a break in NASCAR.\" He won three NASCAR truck races, had a career-best fourth-place finish in the Cup Series in 218 career NASCAR starts.\n\nBickle was brought into the sport as a child, when he watched his father, Rich Sr., race throughout Wisconsin. The younger Bickle began racing motocross at the age of five. While winning the 250cc championship on Sunday nights when he was 16, he raced stock cars at Jefferson Speedway on Saturday nights in 1977. He went behind his father's barn to pick out one of his father's old racecars and selected a beat up 1968 Pontiac GTO. \"It was so beat up you could hardly tell what it was.\" Bickle started racing a 1974 Pontiac as a sportsman at Jefferson for the second half of the 1977 season and the whole 1978 season. Bickle stopped racing motorcycles after he graduated in 1979. He built a 1972 Ford Torino with a 302 cubic inch motor that year, which he began using at mid-season. He used the car to win a heat and the semi-feature at Columbus 151 Speedway in the car's first night out, and it ran well at Lake Geneva Raceway and Rockford Speedway. That off-season he changed the rear clip on the car to improve it for Rockford before deciding to give away the car and build a new one. In 1980 he raced weekly at Rockford, Lake Geneva, and Capital Speedway (now Madison International Speedway), winning 23 semi-features which was the most in the United States. He was named the Sportsman Rookie of the Year at Lake Geneva and Rockford.\n\nBickle turned his Rockford car into a late model in 1981 and raced the car to a Top 5 points finish at Lake Geneva and ninth place at Capital. He raced the car at Slinger Super Speedway and selected ARTGO races. He won his first late model feature that season at Lake Geneva. For 1982, he decided to try to run as many races as he could within 300 miles of his home, and he had raced in between 90 and 100 events by the end of the season. He had won a couple of features and had set fast time at Wisconsin Dells Speedway (now Dells Raceway Park). At the off-season banquet for Slinger Super Speedway, he told track owner Wayne Erickson that he would win the 1983 track championship. Bickle focused on winning Slinger's track championship that year and he finished in the Top 5 in 17 of 18 features that season to win the track championship. In 1984 he raced primarily at Slinger, Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), and Capital. Bickle won his first half mile feature at WIR even though he had raced at Capital for several seasons.\n\nBickle updated his car, hauler, engine, and equipment for 1985 with a new sponsor. He won the season opener at Capital and several other features later in the season en route to winning the track championship. He had a good season at WIR and raced well at the ARTGO races that he ran. In 1986 he won the points championship at Capital Speedway. He had 17 feature wins that season, and he ran well at Slinger, WIR, and Wisconsin Dells. In 1987, he raced at numerous Wisconsin tracks. He won a $15,000-to-win event at Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1987. Butch Miller, who had led most of the race, went in for a pit stop with 60 laps left and Bickle and Ted Musgrave gained the lead. The race was halted for rain and hail with 46 laps left, and it was declared over with Bickle receiving the win.\n\nHe had won 230 races at various short tracks, including Lake Geneva Raceway, Wisconsin International Raceway, and late model track championships at Slinger Super Speedway in 1983 and 1989. Bickle won the Snowball Derby at Five Flags Speedway a record five times: 1990, 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999.\n\nIn 1990, he made his debut in the American Speed Association, a Midwest-based racing organization based primarily in short tracks. He finished runner up to Johnny Benson in Rookie of the Year standings.(Ironically, Benson would take over Bickle's old Cup ride in 2000.)\n\nBickle made his NASCAR Winston Cup debut in 1989 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, in his self-owned, unsponsored #02 Buick. He finished 39th out of 42 cars after his engine expired 37 laps into the race. He made his first start in the Daytona 500 the next year when, once again driving his own underfunded Oldsmobile, and finished 28th, just five laps down. Bickle competed in 11 events over the next three years (leading one lap at Charlotte in 1993). 1994 marked a then career-high in terms of starts, driving ten races, most of them for Harry Melling. After years of limited starts, Bickle made the full-time jump to Cup in 1998, driving the #98 Thorn Apple Valley Ford Taurus for Cale Yarborough, replacing Greg Sacks who had been critically injured in an accident at Texas. Bickle had two top-five qualifying efforts and finished a career-best 4th at Martinsville and delivered an emotional post-race interview. When the sponsorship went away, Bickle signed with Tyler Jet Motorsports to drive the #45 10-10-345 Lucky Dog Pontiac. It was an up-and-down year for Bickle and the team; Bickle posted top-10s at the Pontiac Excitement 400 and the Pocono 500. However he had trouble qualifying for races, and after the Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington, he was released from the team. Bickle drove some for Melling Racing that year. In 2000, Bickle did substitute duty for Joe Bessey's team, and drove one race for Morgan-McClure Motorsports the following year, in addition to driving once for Midwest Transit Racing.\n\nBickle has found considerably more success in the lower levels of NASCAR than he has in Winston Cup. He made his Busch Series debut in 1993 at Atlanta, finishing 27th with engine failure. Bickle's best season in the Busch Series was 1994, where he won one pole and had four top-10 finishes in a limited schedule. In 2001, he made his first full-time run in the Busch Series, driving the #59 Kingsford Chevy, and competed in 27 events before he was released. He has run only one Busch Series race since then.\n\nBickle began racing in the Craftsman Truck Series in 1996 for Petty Enterprises, winning two poles, having 9 top-10 finishes and wound up a solid 11th in points.\n\nFor 1997, he switched to the #17 DieHard Chevrolet owned by Darrell Waltrip Motorsports, and the combination was an instant success. Bickle started four races on the pole position, winning three. He nearly won a fourth race at Sonoma until both a chaotic next-to-last restart occurred as well as rookie Boris Said retaliating against Bickle for contact during that restart; foiling the race for Bickle. When the checkered flag fell on the season, he was second in championship points. Since then he has run a limited schedule in the trucks, the most starts he's had in a season since then is twelve in 2003.\n\nBickle occasionally races at special events at his home tracks in Wisconsin. , Bickle planned to open an auto fabrication business in Edgerton with his father, tentatively named Rock County Flatheads and Fabrication. Bickle had owned an auto customization at his racing shop in Mooresville. He began concentrating more being a businessman and by 2012 he operated three businesses. He owned a hot rod shop in Janesville, Wisconsin, a bar in Madison, Wisconsin, and a drive-shaft business in Madison.\n\nBickle built a new chassis that he raced from 2005 until 2010. He was dissatisfied with the car's performance and acquired one of his early 2000s cars back for the 2011 National Short Track Championship at Rockford Speedway. Bickle was second fastest in practice and raced in the top five during the feature. In 2012 he qualified third for the Slinger Nationals behind Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth. After being sent to the back of the field for early-race contact, he battled his way up to the lead just after half way, and he finished sixth. At the end of the 2012 season, Bickle won the National Short Track Championship race at Rockford Speedway for the second time.\n\nBickle announced that 2013 would be his final season of racing stock cars; competing for the full season in the ARCA Midwest Tour, he also returned to Slinger Super Speedway where he won his fourth Slinger Nationals after the apparent winner, Steve Apel, was disqualified. Bickle battled for the lead in the middle of the 2013 National Short Track Championship race and ended up finishing fourth. He ended his career on the following weekend finishing 22nd at the Oktoberfest 100 ARCA Midwest Tour race at the La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway on October 6, 2013. \nHe came out of retirement in 2015 - racing at the Slinger Nationals, Madison, and several races at Wisconsin International Raceway. In 2015, he was inducted in the Southeastern Wisconsin Short Track Hall of Fame citing his two Slinger track championships and four Slinger Nationals wins. Bickle is the subject of a 2019 book \"Barnyard to Brickyard - The Rich Bickle Story\" and he announced a book signing tour of Wisconsin race tracks in July 2019.\n"}
{"id": "2190913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190913", "title": "Prenatal development", "text": "Prenatal development\n\nPrenatal development () includes the development of the embryo and of the fetus during a viviparous animal's gestation. Prenatal development starts with fertilization, in the germinal stage of embryonic development, and continues in fetal development until birth.\n\nIn human pregnancy, prenatal development is also called antenatal development. The development of the human embryo follows fertilization, and continues as fetal development. By the end of the tenth week of gestational age the embryo has acquired its basic form and is referred to as a fetus. The next period is that of fetal development where many organs become fully developed. This fetal period is described both topically (by organ) and chronologically (by time) with major occurrences being listed by gestational age.\n\nThe very early stages of embryonic development are the same in all mammals. Later stages of development across all taxa of animals and the length of gestation vary.\nIn the human:\n\nDifferent terms are used to describe prenatal development, meaning development before birth. A term with the same meaning is the \"antepartum\" (from Latin \"ante\" \"before\" and \"parere\" \"to give birth\") Sometimes \"antepartum\" is however used to denote the period between the 24th/26th week of gestational age until birth, for example in antepartum hemorrhage.\n\nThe perinatal period (from Greek \"peri\", \"about, around\" and Latin \"nasci\" \"to be born\") is \"around the time of birth\". In developed countries and at facilities where expert neonatal care is available, it is considered from 22 completed weeks (usually about 154 days) of gestation (the time when birth weight is normally 500 g) to 7 completed days after birth. In many of the developing countries the starting point of this period is considered 28 completed weeks of gestation (or weight more than 1000 g).\n\nFertilization marks the first germinal stage of embryonic development. When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes where fertilization usually takes place. Many sperm cells are released with the possibility of just one managing to adhere to and enter the thick protective layer surrounding the egg cell (ovum). The first sperm cell to successfully penetrate the egg cell donates its genetic material (DNA) to combine with the DNA of the egg cell resulting in a new organism called the zygote. The term \"conception\" refers variably to either fertilization or to formation of the conceptus after its implantation in the uterus, and this terminology is controversial.\n\nThe zygote will develop into a male if the egg is fertilized by a sperm that carries a Y chromosome, or a female if the sperm carries an X chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a gene, SRY, which will switch on androgen production at a later stage leading to the development of a male body type. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of the zygote comes entirely from the egg cell.\n\nFollowing fertilization the embryonic stage of development continues until the end of the 10th week (gestational age) (8th week fertilization age). The first two weeks from fertilization is also referred to as the germinal stage or preembryonic stage.\n\nThe zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube dividing several times to form a ball of cells called a morula. Further cellular division is accompanied by the formation of a small cavity between the cells. This stage is called a blastocyst. Up to this point there is no growth in the overall size of the embryo, as it is confined within a glycoprotein shell, known as the zona pellucida. Instead, each division produces successively smaller cells.\n\nThe blastocyst reaches the uterus at roughly the fifth day after fertilization. It is here that lysis of the zona pellucida occurs. This process is analogous to zona hatching, a term that refers to the emergence of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida, when incubated in vitro. This allows the trophectoderm cells of the blastocyst to come into contact with, and adhere to, the endometrial cells of the uterus. The trophectoderm will eventually give rise to extra-embryonic structures, such as the placenta and the membranes. The embryo becomes embedded in the endometrium in a process called implantation. In most successful pregnancies, the embryo implants 8 to 10 days after ovulation. The embryo, the extra-embryonic membranes, and the placenta are collectively referred to as a conceptus, or the \"products of conception\".\n\nRapid growth occurs and the embryo's main features begin to take form. This process is called differentiation, which produces the varied cell types (such as blood cells, kidney cells, and nerve cells). A spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, in the first trimester of pregnancy is usually due to major genetic mistakes or abnormalities in the developing embryo. During this critical period (most of the first trimester), the developing embryo is also susceptible to toxic exposures, such as:\n\n\nThe embryo passes through 3 phases of acquisition of nutrition from the mother:\n\nFetal development is the third of the three stages of prenatal development, following from the initial germinal stage (preembryonic stage), and stage of embryonic development. These stages are also referred to in pregnancy as terms or trimesters.\n\nFrom the 10th week of gestation (8th week of development), the developing organism is called a fetus.\n\nAll major structures are already formed in the fetus, but they continue to grow and develop. Since the precursors of all the major organs are created by this time, the fetal period is described both by organ and by a list of changes by weeks of gestational age.\n\nBecause the precursors of the organs are now formed, the fetus is not as sensitive to damage from environmental exposure as the embryo was. Instead, toxic exposure often causes physiological abnormalities or minor congenital malformation.\n\nDevelopment continues throughout the life of the fetus and through into life after birth. Significant changes occur to many systems in the period after birth as they adapt to life outside the uterus.\n\nHematopoiesis first takes place in the yolk sac. The function is transferred to the liver by the 10th week of gestation and to the spleen and bone marrow beyond that. The total blood volume is about 125 ml/kg of fetal body weight near term.\n\nMegaloblastic red blood cells are produced early in development, which become normoblastic near term. Life span of prenatal RBCs is 80 days. Rh antigen appears at about 40 days of gestation.\n\nThe fetus starts producing leukocytes at 2 months gestational age, mainly from the thymus and the spleen. Lymphocytes derived from the thymus are called T lymphocytes (T cells), whereas those derived from bone marrow are called B lymphocytes (B cells). Both of these populations of lymphocytes have short-lived and long-lived groups. Short-lived T cells usually reside in thymus, bone marrow and spleen; whereas long-lived T cells reside in the blood stream. Plasma cells are derived from B cells and their life in fetal blood is 0.5 to 2 days.\n\nThe thyroid is the first gland to develop in the embryo at the 4th week of gestation. Insulin secretion in the fetus starts around the 12th week of gestation.\n\nInitial knowledge of the effects of prenatal experience on later neuropsychological development originates from the Dutch Famine Study, which researched the cognitive development of individuals born after the Dutch famine of 1944–45. The first studies focused on the consequences of the famine to cognitive development, including the prevalence of intellectual disability. Such studies predate David Barker's hypothesis about the association between the prenatal environment and the development of chronic conditions later in life. The initial studies found no association between malnourishment and cognitive development, but later studies found associations between malnourishment and increased risk for schizophrenia, antisocial disorders, and affective disorders.\n\nThere is evidence that the acquisition of language begins in the prenatal stage. After 26 weeks of gestation, the peripheral auditory system is already fully formed. Also, most low-frequency sounds (less than 300 Hz) can reach the fetal inner ear in the womb of mammals. Those low-frequency sounds include pitch, rhythm, and phonetic information related to language. Studies have indicated that fetuses react to and recognize differences between sounds. Such ideas are further reinforced by the fact that newborns present a preference for their mother's voice, present behavioral recognition of stories only heard during gestation, and (in monolingual mothers) present preference for their native language. A more recent study with EEG demonstrated different brain activation in newborns hearing their native language compared to when they were presented with a different language, further supporting the idea that language learning starts while in gestation.\n\nGrowth rate of fetus is linear up to 37 weeks of gestation, after which it plateaus. The growth rate of an embryo and infant can be reflected as the weight per gestational age, and is often given as the weight put in relation to what would be expected by the gestational age. A baby born within the normal range of weight for that gestational age is known as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). An abnormally slow growth rate results in the infant being small for gestational age, and, on the other hand, an abnormally large growth rate results in the infant being large for gestational age. A slow growth rate and preterm birth are the two factors that can cause a low birth weight. Low birth weight (below 2000 grams) can slightly increase the likelihood of schizophrenia.\n\nThe growth rate can be roughly correlated with the fundal height which can be estimated by abdominal palpation. More exact measurements can be performed with obstetric ultrasonography.\n\nIntrauterine growth restriction is one of the causes of low birth weight associated with over half of neonatal deaths.\n\nPoverty has been linked to poor prenatal care and has been an influence on prenatal development. Women in poverty are more likely to have children at a younger age, which results in low birth weight. Many of these expecting mothers have little education and are therefore less aware of the risks of smoking, drinking alcohol, and drug use other factors that influence the growth rate of a fetus.\n\nWomen between the ages of 16 and 35 have a healthier environment for a fetus than women under 16 or over 35. Women between this age gap are more likely to have fewer complications. Women over 35 are more inclined to have a longer labor period, which could potentially result in death of the mother or fetus. Women under 16 and over 35 have a higher risk of preterm labor (premature baby), and this risk increases for women in poverty, women who take drugs, and women who smoke. Young mothers are more likely to engage in high risk behaviors, such as using alcohol, drugs, or smoking, resulting in negative consequences for the fetus. Premature babies from young mothers are more likely to have neurological defects that will influence their coping capabilities irritability, trouble sleeping, constant crying for example. There is a risk of Down syndrome for infants born to those aged over 40 years. Young teenaged mothers (younger than 16) and mothers over 35 are more exposed to the risks of miscarriages, premature births, and birth defects.\n\nAn estimated 5 percent of fetuses in the United States are exposed to illicit drug use during pregnancy. Maternal drug use occurs when drugs ingested by the pregnant woman are metabolized in the placenta and then transmitted to the fetus.\n\nWhen using cannabis, there is a greater risk of birth defects, low birth weight, and a higher rate of death in infants or stillbirths. Drug use will influence extreme irritability, crying, and risk for SIDS once the fetus is born.\nMarijuana will slow the fetal growth rate and can result in premature delivery. It can also lead to low birth weight, a shortened gestational period and complications in delivery.\n\nOpioids including heroin will cause interrupted fetal development, stillbirths, and can lead to numerous birth defects. Heroin can also result in premature delivery, creates a higher risk of miscarriages, result in facial abnormalities and head size, and create gastrointestinal abnormalities in the fetus. There is an increased risk for SIDS, dysfunction in the central nervous system, and neurological dysfunctions including tremors, sleep problems, and seizures. The fetus is also put at a great risk for low birth weight and respiratory problems.\n\nCocaine use results in a smaller brain, which results in learning disabilities for the fetus. Cocaine puts the fetus at a higher risk of being stillborn or premature. Cocaine use also results in low birthweight, damage to the central nervous system, and motor dysfunction.\n\nPrenatal methamphetamine exposure has shown to negatively impact brain development and behavioral functioning. A 2019 study further investigated neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure. This study had two groups, one containing children who were prenatally exposed to methamphetamine but no other illicit drugs and one containing children who met diagnosis criteria for ADHD but were not prenatally exposed to any illicit substance. Both groups of children completed intelligence measures to compute an IQ. Study results showed that the prenatally exposed children performed lower on the intelligence measures than their non-exposed peers with ADHD. The study results also suggest that prenatal exposure to methamphetamine may negatively impact processing speed as children develop.\n\nMaternal alcohol use leads to disruptions of the fetus's brain development, interferes with the fetus's cell development and organization, and affects the maturation of the central nervous system. Even small amounts of alcohol use can cause lower height, weight and head size at birth and higher aggressiveness and lower intelligence during childhood. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that is a consequence of heavy alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy. Children with FASD have a variety of distinctive facial features, heart problems, and cognitive problems such as developmental disabilities, attention difficulties, and memory deficits.\n\nTobacco smoking during pregnancy exposes the fetus to nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine results in less blood flow to the fetus because it constricts the blood vessels. Carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen flow to the fetus. The reduction of blood and oxygen flow may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and premature births. Exposure to secondhand smoke leads to higher risks of low birth weight and childhood cancer.\n\nIf a mother is infected with a disease, the placenta cannot always filter out the pathogens. Viruses such as rubella, chicken pox, mumps, herpes, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, prematurity, physical malformations, and intellectual disabilities. HIV can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Untreated HIV carries a risk of between 10 and 20 per cent of being passed on to the fetus. Bacterial or parasitic diseases may also be passed on to the fetus, and include chlamydia, syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria, and commonly toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis can be acquired through eating infected undercooked meat or contaminated food, and by drinking contaminated water. The risk of fetal infection is lowest during early pregnancy, and highest during the third trimester. However, in early pregnancy the outcome is worse, and can be fatal.\n\nAdequate nutrition is needed for a healthy fetus. Mothers who gain less than 20 pounds during pregnancy are at increased risk for having a preterm or low birth weight infant. Iron and iodine are especially important during prenatal development. Mothers who are deficient in iron are at risk for having a preterm or low birth weight infant. Iodine deficiencies increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and fetal brain abnormalities Adequate prenatal care gives an improved result in the newborn.\n\nLow birth weight increases an infants risk of long-term growth and cognitive and language deficits. It also results in a shortened gestational period and can lead to prenatal complications.\n\nStress during pregnancy can impact the development of the embryo. Reilly (2017) states that stress can come from many forms of life events such as community, family, financial issues, and natural causes. While a woman is pregnant, stress from outside sources can take a toll on the growth in the womb that may affect the child's learning and relationships when born. For instance, they may have behavioral problems and might be antisocial. The stress that the mother experiences affects the fetus and the fetus' growth which can include the fetus' nervous system (Reilly, 2017). Stress can also lead to low birth weight. Even after avoiding other factors like alcohol, drugs, and being healthy, stress can have its impacts whether families know it or not. Many women who deal with maternal stress do not seek treatment.\nSimilar to stress, Reilly stated that in recent studies, researchers have found that pregnant women who show depressive symptoms are not as attached and bonded to their child while it is in the womb (2017).\n\nExposure to environmental toxins in pregnancy lead to higher rates of miscarriage, sterility, and birth defects. Toxins include fetal exposure to lead, mercury, and ethanol or hazardous environments. Prenatal exposure to mercury may lead to physical deformation, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and poor motoric coordination. Exposure to high levels of lead prenatally is related to prematurity, low birth weight, brain damage, and a variety of physical defects. Exposure to persistent air pollution from traffic and smog may lead to reduced infant head size, low birth weight, increased infant death rates, impaired lung and immune system development.\n\n\n\n"}

Some of his work includes organizing a number of vehicles for peace in Mexico; including \"Thinking Out Loud\" (\"Pensar en Voz Alta\", 1995), a Gandhian-inspired nonviolent action collective; and the \"Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity\" (MPJD, 2011), founded by the poet Javier Sicilia and the families of dead and missing persons.\n\nDrawing on Gandhian strategy, Ameglio helped organize some of the largest mass civic actions against violence and war in Mexico. Ameglio, along with close collaborator Javier Sicilia, served as a main organizer of the National March for Peace with Justice and Dignity in May 2011.\n\nAfter the death of Sicilia's son on March 28, a cry for social justice was launched under the slogan \"We've had it up to here!\" ( \"\"¡Estoy hasta la madre!\"\"), demanding an end to violence and state complicity in escalating militarism. Ameglio organized an 85-kilometer \"Silent March\" for survivors and victims of drug-related violence whose suffering had largely been ignored by the public. Between 15,000 and 25,000 protesters joined this four-day march from Cuernavaca to Zócalo (the main plaza in Mexico City) where 200,000 people gathered to listen to their testimony.\n\nThe protestors also called for an alternative approach to Mexico’s “war strategy” in the escalating war on drugs. Over the four day march for peace with justice, thousands of protestors signed a “Social Pact” calling for the government to enact reforms to bring truth and justice, end the war on drugs, fight corruption and impunity, combat poverty and the crime-based economy, implement economic policies to help the youth, and democratize politics and the media. The movement called for autonomous bodies of peace rather than just a call for dialogue with the government, and represented a radical change from a “war strategy” to one of citizen security with respect for human rights. The agreement was signed by civil society organizations on June 10 in Ciudad Juarez.\n\nThe movement spurred related protests in 31 Mexican cities and 17 cities across the globe to oppose violence and recognize the dignity of survivors and victims. The largest protest took place in San Cristobal de Las Casas, in the southern State of Chiapas, where 5,000 members of the left-wing Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) expressed support for the movement, solidarity with victims, and opposition to the armed forces fighting the war on drugs.\n\nFollowing up on the May 2011 protests, Ameglio worked with the MPJD to create the “Caravan of Consolation” (June 2011) and the “Caravan to the South” (September 2011), which traveled through the areas of northern and southern of Mexico, the hardest hit by the violence. The caravans provided a platform for victims’ families to speak out, to connect with the Movement of Peace and human rights groups, and to become active in the struggle for victims’ rights, and to stop terror.\n\nIn 2011, he played a key role in organizing a two-day public fast and bi-national encounter in Juarez on the US-Texas border when it was the epicenter of the violence. Prior to this, Ameglio had organized nonviolent direct action outside of military bases (the first of their kind in Mexico) and civil disobedience in defense of the rights of street vendors in Cuernavaca.\n\nAs a member of SERPAJ-Morelos and the Latin American Council of Peace Research (CLAIP), Ameglio defended the rights of environmentalists, helping to organize a national ecological civil resistance struggle to save the Casino de la Selva park space in Cuernavaca in the face of a Costco construction project (2001-2004), resulting in his arrest and incarceration as a prisoner of conscience. He has extensive experience in practicing nonviolence with direct actions in Bosnia with “Mir Sada” (1993) and in Chiapas conflict zones (1994-2006) working with peace camps, solidarity caravans, and human rights denunciations.\n\nBorn in Uruguay and educated in México, Ameglio completed his undergraduate studies in History at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and earned a Master’s in Contemporary History at the Autonomous University of Morelos (UAEM). Ameglio served 18 years as Chair of the Humanities Department at La Salle University in Cuernavaca.\n\nAmeglio has held both the Henry D. Thoreau Special Chair and the Spanish Exile Masters – Due Disobedience Special Chair (2008-2014) within the School of Philosophy and Literature at National Autonomous University (UNAM) in Mexico City. He teaches classes on “Peace Pedagogy”, “Civil Resistance” and “Techniques of Nonviolence” at the UNAM and the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana. These courses combine peace and nonviolence culture from Gandhi, Thich Nhat Hanh, Donald Hessler, Nelson Mandela, and the Zapatistas. Ameglio uses a methodology of constructing knowledge that draws on Jean Piaget and Juan Carlos Marín.\n\nIn the spirit of Gandhi’s “construction program,” Ameglio has collaborated with indigenous education promoters in the autonomous territories of Chiapas to develop curricula that include their cultural and artistic expressions, as well as their history of social and political struggle. This curriculum is now taught within the Zapatista autonomous school system.\n\nAmeglio is the founder and member of “Thinking Out loud”, or \"Pensar en Voz Alta\" (SERPAJ-PICASO), a Gandhian research collaborative that compiles, analyzes and publicizes statistical information on the nature of social conflict in Mexico. SERPAJ-PICASO also promotes nonviolent direct actions through peace camps and anti-militarism protests, and engages the public through expositions about Gandhi and militarism in Mexico. The expositions cover different forms of exclusion, discrimination, violence, and repression of social movements that affect society, especially indigenous groups.\n\nAmeglio also co-founded, with an ecumenical community in 1991, an alternative school called \"Walking Together\" in Cuernavaca for children who live or work on the streets to build community solidarity and study to create more human alternatives for their future lives. Ameglio is committed to engaging youth more directly in peace education and nonviolent activism. In 2014, he co-founded the Peace and Nonviolence Team with students in the Philosophy Department at the UNAM.\n\nPietro is a frequent contributor to conferences, newspapers and magazines, and is author of \"Gandhi y la desobediencia civil: Mexico hoy\" (Gandhi and civil disobedience. Mexico today) (Plaza y Valdés, México, 2002). He is the author of \"Gandhi y la desobediencia civil: México hoy\" (Gandhi and the civil disobedience, Mexico today) (Plaza and Valdés, Mexico, 2002), a book on non-violence in Mexico. He co-founded the ecumenical and nonviolence review, \"Ixtus: Society and Culture\", with Javier Sicilia in 1991. He has written in \"La Jornada-Morelos\", and also served as Project Coordinator and Research Traveling Exhibition \"“Racismo y Cultura”\" (Racism and Culture 1996); \"“Gandhi: encuentros con la verdad”\" (Encounters with Truth 1998); \"“La paz tras el cerco”\" (where he contributed with the script and video production); \"“Atenco libre”\" (2006).\n\n2014 – Winner of the annual El-Hibri Peace Education Prize.\n\n2008 - Service of Peace and Justice in Cuernavaca, México. SERPAJ was a recipient of the International Pfeffer Prize, granted for Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) at the Festival of Peace (Nyack, NY.)\n\n"}

Endowed with such spectacular mountainous terrain, Núi Cấm is known as the \"Đà Lạt of the Mekong Delta\".\n\nBefore reaching the Seven Mountain, tourists have to ascend Ba The mountain. The mountain is approximately 200 meters above sea level and by the poetic Thoai Ha River, there is home to many species of monkeys, squirrels, herons, and wild birds\n\nThe common names of the seven mountains in the Thất Sơn range are:\n\n\nThe prince Nguyễn Ánh, who later proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945), sought refuge on the mountain from the Tây Sơn insurgents. Ánh forbade anyone to come to the mountain, hence its Vietnamese name meaning \"forbidden mountain\". Followers of the Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương tradition, founded in An Giang in 1849, refer to these mountains as \"Bửu Sơn\" (\"Precious Mountains\"), since their founder, Đoàn Minh Huyên, is said to have spent time in meditation in these mountains.\n\nThe history of Cam Mountain (Thiên Cẩm Sơn, \"heaven's forbidden mountain\")- Prince Nguyen Anh (later Gia Long king) lost the battle who was wanted by Tay Son. He decided to hide in this mountain. The Mandarins had to ban people from going to the mountain with a fake reason that there were many ogres and poisonous creatures and beasts. The name of the mountain came after this event, The Forbidden Mountain.\n\nThe history of Co To Mountain- The Co To Mountain was a secret place to hide for Vietnamese soldiers in the Vietnam War. The place was covered by rock paths, wide, and narrow trail. Inside of the mountain, there was a large cave that used to call as the Tuyen Dao cave of An Giang Provincial Party Committee. The cave was used as the weapon storage, and could accommodate up to 150 people.\n\nThe mystery of Ngu Ho son (Five Wells Mountain)-In the dry season, every well is always full of water mysteriously. It is because of this mystery that women and men usually come here to worship.\n\nThe history of Dai mountain-This was a dangerous forest area. Between 1962–1967, this place was a base of An Giang Provincial Party Committee in Vietnam War. According to the story, in 1969 a front-line platoon of 61 was bombed by enemy aircraft. The mouth of the cave collapsed. Seven soldiers were trapped in the cave. The seven soldiers used bamboo tubes to bring milk and porridge. After a few days, the unit had to leave the teammates and retreat to U Minh forest.\n\nKet Mountain (Anh Vũ Sơn)- According to history, in 1851, Doan Minh Huyen was a Buddha Master Tay An and his disciples went to the Ket mountain to develop the Ket Mountain. After a while, the Ket Mountain become a large and fertile lands. After they were gone, Hung Thoi and Xuan Son villages residents have continually built the land of the mountain and it became the Ket Mountain today.\n\nTuong Mountain - In the 1870s, Tuong Mountain was wild. Ngo Loi was a Buddha Master who was the Tuong Mountain Keeper. He and his disciplines went to the mountain to develop a few small villages. They were called as An Dinh, An Thanh, An lap villages. He and his disciplines also built Tam Bao and Phi Lai temples. Tuong Mountain became more popular and attracted a lot of people visit\n\nWater Mountain-In 806–820, there was a gust from North Vietnam who was a discipline of Cao Bien (a Buddha Master). When he came to the Water Mountain, Cao Bien's discipline discovered a beast on Water mountain, so he used his hand to control a beast successfully and stopped the beast came out from the water.

The area is roughly bounded by the Dallow Downs to the north and north-east, Stockwood Park to the south, the M1 to the west, and Wilsden Avenue and Bolingbroke Road to the east.\n\nIn the late 12th century a 'hospital' was built on the Stockwood Estate in Farley Hill. This old hospital was partly renovated and extended to house a museum that holds the 'Mossman Collection', a large collection of horsedrawn carriages and other vehicles, along with locally found artifacts, a historical garden and a craft center.\n\nThe estate was constructed after World War II to replace houses destroyed by German bombers. The design of the estate primarily consists of residential housing, which was considered advanced at the time of its construction, incorporating a shopping precinct in the centre of a large roundabout and a wide avenue stretching from the centre to the edge of Stockwood Park. Farley Hill is served by two Junior schools, St Margaret Of Scotland Roman Catholic which opened in 1960 to serve the large, mainly Irish, Roman Catholic population and Farley Juniors which opened in 1952.\n\nA single secondary school, Rotheram Senior School existed until 1988 but dwindling numbers and government funding restrictions led to its amalgamation with Stockwood High School into South Luton High School on Cutenhoe Road. The school then converted to academy status in 2007, and it was renamed Barnfield South Academy as part of the Barnfield Federation. In 2011, the school moved to a new £30 million building situated on the old playing field of the former Rotheram High School site. In 2015 the school changed its name to South Academy and became part of The Shared Learning Trust. In 2016 it was renamed as Stockwood Park Academy.\n\nA view of Luton can be seen from the top of the Dallow Hills which are situated on the outskirts of the estate.\n\nThe area is next to Stockwood Park, which contains the Mossman Collection, Stockwood Museum, gardens, playing fields and 3 par golf course.\n\nThe Farley ward is represented by Cllr Paul Castleman (Labour), Cllr Mahmood Hussain (Labour) and Cllr Sian Timoney (Labour). \nThe ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Luton South, and the MP is Gavin Shuker.\n\nTwo weekly newspapers are delivered free to all houses in Farley Hill, with news about Luton and the surrounding area.\n"}

He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 62 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE for Beard Motorsports. Gaughan is the grandson of Vegas gaming pioneer Jackie Gaughan and son of Michael Gaughan, a hotel and casino magnate.\n\nGaughan began his career racing in off-road racing and he rose through the ranks from pickup trucks to the professional two-wheel-drive Trophy Truck class. In the late 1990s, he switched to pavement racing in a stock car. This led to a career in NASCAR racing. He began in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series (now NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series), which was followed by the Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) and Cup Series during the 2000s.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California but a long-term resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, Gaughan attended Georgetown University and played collegiate basketball as a walk-on for the Hoyas with friend and former Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson. He is also the brother of Las Vegas gaming executive John Gaughan.\n\nGaughan earned All-Conference honors as a placekicker on Georgetown's NCAA Division I-AA football team. He was primarily a role player on the basketball team whose jobs were mostly practice related but did see action in 25 games.\n\nA unique individual, he even sported cornrows during a race at Dover International Speedway during the 2005 Craftsman Truck Series season. On August 18, 2007, he married his wife Tatum, and on October 30, 2010, Gaughan and Tatum welcomed a baby boy, who they named Michael James. His second son William was born on October 11, 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Gaughan appeared as a spokesperson for the South Point Casino in an episode of the History Channel series \"Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy\".\n\nIn 2015, Gaughan was a guest analyst for the ARCA Racing Series race at Kentucky.\n\nGaughan won his first race in a 1991 Southern Nevada Off-Road Enthusiasts (SNORE) off-road race. He was the Class 10 SNORE champion in 1991, 1992, and 1993.\n\nIn 1995, he moved to SODA (Short-course Off-road Drivers Association) series driving a Dodge Ram for the Walker Evans team. He was the 1995 Class 13 champion. He raced in premiere two-wheel-drive trophy truck Class 8 in 1996 and 1997 but did not win either championship as Scott Taylor won both championships. He moved with most SODA drivers to Championship Off-Road Racing (CORR) at the end of 1997 and raced in the Pro-2 category through 1998 where he finished third behind champion Ricky Johnson and Scott Taylor.\n\nHis biggest wins came at Crandon International Off-Road Raceway. His multiple wins there solidified his reputation as one of the premier off-road racers at the time with his most memorable battle coming between himself and future NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson in 1996. The two dueled throughout the race with Johnson having to come from behind after contact with Scott Taylor. However, Johnson's truck succumbed to crash damage from a previous incident with Jimmie Crowder and Gaughan took his first win at Crandon in a pro category. He followed the win with a repeat performance the next year at Crandon, this time piloting a Chevrolet.\n\nGaughan made his NASCAR debut in a Truck Series race in 1997 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Driving the No. 20 Orleans Hotel & Casino-sponsored Dodge for Walker Evans, he qualified 18th and finished 24th. He ran two races in 1998 with the No.20 team, but he failed to finish both races. He also attempted his first Busch race at Las Vegas, but he failed to qualify. In 1998, he was part of the Coca-Cola 500 at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan and was involved in a crash that also collected Bobby Hamilton.\n\nHe then decided to move to stock car racing. He ran in the Winston West Series in 1999, and was the 2000 and 2001 champion on the circuit. He attempted to qualify for a Busch Series race at Pikes Peak International Raceway in 2000, but failed to make the race. In 2001, he made his Busch Series debut at Fontana for Ed Whitaker but finished 41st. The next week, he attempted his first Winston Cup race at Las Vegas but failed to qualify. He also ran seven times in the Truck Series for Bill McAnally and TKO Motorsports, and had two top-five finishes.\n\nIn 2002, Gaughan and his father fielded a team for himself in the Truck Series full-time. He drove the No. 62 NAPA Auto Parts-sponsored truck to two victories on his way to the Rookie of the Year title. In 2003, he drove the No. 62 Orleans-sponsored Dodge for his father Michael, and he won six times, including twice at Texas Motor Speedway, giving him four consecutive wins at the track. He also held the points lead for most of the season, but finished 4th in points after wrecking in the last race of the season with Marty Houston, a teammate of one of Gaughan's rivals for the championship, Ted Musgrave.\n\nIn 2004, Gaughan moved up to the Nextel Cup Series, driving the No. 77 Eastman Kodak-sponsored Dodge for Penske-Jasper Racing. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year standings and 28th in the final points standings. He finished the season with four Top 10’s, including a career-best Top 5 finish at Talladega Superspeedway, where he had been in contention to win before Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and several other drivers shuffled Gaughan back to fourth place. He did come close to a win at the Glen where he led a total of seven laps in the final 25 laps. He then spun out with 19 laps to go and then broke a transmission, finishing 34th. He was replaced at the end of the season by Travis Kvapil, after team owner Roger Penske was not satisfied with Gaughan's progress in the sport.\n\nIn 2005, he moved back to the Truck Series, behind the wheel of the No. 77 Dodge Ram. He finished 19th in the final points standings, with 2 top-five and 7 top-ten finishes. Starting with the September 23 race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the team began sporting a new livery of the South Point Casino in which his father, Michael, is the owner.\n\nIn 2007, the South Point team switched to Chevrolet Silverados, where Gaughan returned to the manufacturer which he drove during his efforts in the AutoZone West championships. In 2008, South Point Racing was to merge with Wyler Racing into Wyler-Gaughan Racing, fielding the No. 60 and No. 77 Toyotas. But the deal fell through and SPR was forced to close, leaving Gaughan and 10-12 of his crew members without a team. Gaughan signed to the drive No. 10 Ford F-150 for Circle Bar Racing in the 2008 CTS season. He had five top-tens and finished fifteenth in points.\n\nIn 2009, Gaughan drove the No. 62 Chevy for Rusty Wallace Racing in the Nationwide Series. In 2010, he rejoined RWR, but this time in a Toyota, RWR switched manufacturers at the end of 2009. He also competed in the November Phoenix Cup race for TRG Motorsports where he finished 43rd after a first-lap crash. For 2011 he returned to the Camping World Truck Series to drive the No. 62 South Point Toyota for Germain Racing while Michael Annett replaced him at RWR. However, Gaughan was unhappy with the lagging performance of the team and left the team at the end of the season. In 2012, he joined Richard Childress Racing to compete in 18 races between the Truck Series and Nationwide Series, as well as four Sprint Cup Series races in the No. 33 South Point Casino Chevrolet. Gaughan's performances in his limited opportunities were strong, posting four top 5s in 8 truck races, and five top 10s in 10 Nationwide Series races.\n\nGaughan returned to the Truck Series full-time in 2013, driving the No. 62 South Point Chevrolet for Childress with crew chief Shane Wilson. After 77 laps led, 10 top 5s and 13 top 10s in the 22 truck races that season, it was announced that Gaughan and Wilson would be moving up to the Nationwide Series full-time for RCR for the 2014 season.\n\nGaughan won his first Nationwide Series race at Road America in June 2014 after Alex Tagliani ran out of gas before the final caution. After a battle with Chase Elliott, he passed Elliott on the final lap to win the race. He was very emotional about his win as he was running a car dedicated to his deceased grandfather John Jackie Gaughan. Following the emotional win, Gaughan continued his success racing up front consistently and by winning the VisitMyrtleBeach.com 300 at Kentucky.\n\nIn 2015, Gaughan competed full-time in the Xfinity Series once again for RCR. He also drove the No. 62 Sprint Cup car for Premium Motorsports in most of the series' races without RCR support. Gaughan would not reach victory lane as he did the season before, with his best finish being runner up in California. He would finish the Xfinity season with a career-high 14 top 10s.\n\nIn the Cup series, after a 28th-place finish to begin the season in Atlanta, Gaughan failed to qualify with Premium Motorsports at Martinsville suffering his first DNQ of the year. He then failed to qualify for five of the next six after that, and blew a tire and crashed in his only start in this period, at Talladega. He successfully qualified for the 2015 Autism Speaks 400 and again for Pocono, before suffering two more DNQs at Michigan and Sonoma. He did make the field at Daytona and finished 28th after suffering from a stuck throttle for more than half the race. Before Kentucky, he and Premium Motorsports agreed to part ways.\nThe 2016 season would mark Gaughan's third season in the number 62 for RCR. Gaughan, on the strength of career highs in top 5s (4), top 10s (15), and average finish (11.4), qualified for the Xfinity Series Chase. Gaughan successfully made it into the Round of 8 with two top 10s in the first 3 races. The Round of 8 began with bad luck, as Gaughan spun through the grass in the first race of the Round of 8 at Kansas, leaving him below the cut line with two races left.\n\nAfter speculation about retirement, Gaughan announced he would return to RCR's No. 62 in 2017. Gaughan also announced he would run his first Daytona 500 since 2004, driving for Beard Motorsports. He finished the 500 in 11th place, earning him starts with Beard at the three remaining Cup Series restrictor-plate races.\n\nGaughan then had a dismal first quarter of the Xfinity season, with many mechanical failures and several instances of being swept up in accidents. Gaughan's average finish in Xfinity following Talladega was below 25th. Gaughan did return to the No. 75 Cup car at Talladega, finishing 27th. He returned to the No. 75 for the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona, where, despite being involved in a couple wrecks, was able to finish 7th. It was his first top-10 of the year, as well as his first top-10 and best Cup finish since finishing 6th at the season-ending Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway in 2004. After the 2017 Xfinity season, Gaughan announced it would be his final full season in NASCAR, though he intends to continue racing part-time for Beard at the Cup Series' superspeedways.\n\nDuring the 2019 1000Bulbs.com 500 at Talladega, Gaughan ran as high as second and led for a split second before being collected in a wreck that sent his No. 62 car into a flip over Kurt Busch and Matt DiBenedetto. Gaughan finished 27th and was unharmed in the crash. On December 21, 2019, Gaughan announced that he will retire from racing after the 2020 season.\n\nOn February 9, 2020, Gaughan made the field at the 2020 Daytona 500 by posting the second fastest qualifying speed of all the non-charter teams (188.945 mph; 33rd overall).\n\n Season still in progress\n\n"}
{"id": "2190930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190930", "title": "Juan Almonte", "text": "Juan Almonte\n\nJuan Nepomuceno Almonte (May 15, 1803 – March 21, 1869) was a 19th-century Mexican official, soldier and diplomat, the natural son of Fr. José María Morelos. He was a veteran of the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. Almonte was also a leader of Mexico's Conservatives in the 1860s and served as regent after the Second Mexican Empire was established by Napoleon III of France.\n\nAlmonte was born in the town of Carácuaro in the state of Michoacán. He was the son of José María Morelos, a Roman Catholic priest who led the insurgents in the Mexican War of Independence from 1811 to 1815, and Brígida Almonte. His mother, Brígida Almonte, was said to be of pure Amerindian ancestry. In 1815 Morelos sent Almonte to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was educated and learned fluent English. At his trial, Morelos was accused by the Mexican Inquisition following his capture that he had sent his son there to learn the doctrines of \"heretical maxims of Protestantism,\" to which Morelos responded he sent his son there because of his concern about his son's safety in Mexico. While in New Orleans, Almonte worked as a clerk for hardware merchant Puech & Bein. His time in the United States was cut short when his father was executed on December 22, 1815 in the village of San Cristóbal Ecatepec.\n\nBetween 1822 and 1824, Almonte was on the staff of insurgent rebel leader José Félix Trespalacios in Texas and then was sent as a part of the Mexican delegation to London. Almonte assisted Ambassador José Mariano Michelena in negotiating a commercial and amity treaty with England. This was Mexico's first treaty as a new nation. In 1830, while serving in Mexican Congress, Almonte became an object of government attention as editor of \"El Atleta\". He accused President Anastasio Bustamante of allowing foreign intervention in national affairs. Because of his stance, Almonte's arrest was ordered on April 16, 1830. He was forced to seek refuge in New Orleans due to government pressure, and the paper collapsed due to heavy fines levied by Bustamante’s government. Later, Bustamante relented and appointed Almonte secretary of the Mexican Legation Extraordinary in 1831. His new job was to represent Mexico in the Republics of South America and the Empire of Brazil. Almonte married María Dolores Quesada on March 1, 1840 in Mexico City and they had a daughter named María de Guadalupe Anastacia Aleja Brígida Saturnina.\n\nIn 1834 Vice President Valentín Gómez Farías appointed Almonte and Col. José María Díaz Noriega to make an inspection tour of Texas and write a status report on what they witnessed. In late January 1836 Almonte was appointed aide-de-camp to Antonio López de Santa Anna and accompanied him to Texas in an attempt to quell the rebellion there.\n\nSanta Anna led his army directly for San Antonio de Bexar, where a small group of Texians was garrisoned at the former Alamo Mission. As the Mexican army occupied the city, Texian co-commander James Bowie sent Green B. Jameson to speak with Santa Anna. Instead, Jameson met with Almonte. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional. In his March 6 journal entry after the battle, Mexican Almonte listed the Texian casualty toll as 250, with the survivors being five women, one Mexican soldier and one slave. Almonte did not record the names of either the defenders or the survivors, and his count was based solely on who was there during the final assault.\n\nAlmonte is said to have had the role in saving Susannah Dickinson. According to some interviews she gave, a Mexican officer intervened to spare her and her daughter's life. This officer was presumed to be either an English mercenary named Black, or Almonte. Then, she said she was taken before Santa Anna, who was talked out of imprisoning her by Almonte.\n\nOn April 21, 1836, Almonte, at the head of part of the Guerrero battalion, surrendered to Texian Thomas J. Rusk at the Battle of San Jacinto. Almonte led the last organized resistance of the panicked army. On the following day Santa Anna also was taken prisoner. Almonte stayed with Santa Anna during his imprisonment acting as interpreter and negotiator. Almonte accompanied Santa Anna during his incarceration on Galveston Island. Then they were taken up the Brazos river to the Phelps plantation, about 30 miles from Velasco, and kept there during the summer and autumn of 1836. While staying there the rumors spread that there were plans to rescue the prisoners. When an escape plot was later discovered, Almonte and Santa Anna were each forced to wear a heavy ball and chain for 52 and 53 days respectively. Finally, through the efforts of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston, Almonte, accompanied by Texas Vice-President Lorenzo de Zavala and Bailey Hardeman was sent along with Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., where they had several meetings with U.S. President Andrew Jackson. After eight days in Washington, they left the U.S. on January 31, 1837. The party returned to Mexico in February. By then, Santa Anna had been replaced as President of Mexico and went into retirement. Almonte, though, continued his diplomatic and military career and eventually rose to the rank of major general. He published a book on geography in late 1837.\n\nIn January 1838, Almonte became a member of the Junta Directiva, which governed the Normal School of the Army. In March 1838 he was appointed secretary of the Mexican legation to London. In June 1839 Almonte headed the Mexican legation to Belgium. From July 1839 to October 1841, he was secretary of war and marine under President Bustamante. Almonte was later appointed minister plenipotentiary to Washington in 1841-1845 under President José Joaquín de Herrera. With the annexation of the Republic of Texas to the United States, Almonte packed his bags on March 6 and returned to Mexico via Veracruz. Almonte favored the installation of Gen. Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga at this time. But while stopping in Havana as minister to France, Almonte re-joined forces with the exiled former president and general Santa Anna and together they traveled back to Mexico.\n\nWhen the Mexican–American War broke out, José Mariano Salas was \"ad interim\" president for Santa Anna and Almonte served as Secretary of War until he was replaced with Valentín Canalizo. In February 1847 Almonte and a few other Mexican generals tried to oust Gómez Farías from power, but failed. They were arrested and jailed for a time in the convent of Santiago Tlatelolco.\n\nAfter the war, Almonte served as senator from Oaxaca for four years, then served as Mexico's representative to the U.S. under President Santa Anna (his last time as president).\n\nAfter the ouster of Santa Anna in 1855, Mexican liberals came to power and began to implement their vision of Mexico through changes in law and ultimately the writing of a new constitution in 1857. The Constitution of 1857, established February 5, 1857, codified major changes, especially the separation of church and state. Mexican conservatives refused to swear fealty to the new constitution and set up a parallel government under general Félix Zuloaga and precipitated the War of the Reform (or Three Years' War). During this period, General Almonte was named special emissary to Spain to deal with outstanding bilateral issues between the two countries. While in Europe, he sought European powers' intervention in Mexico, concerned that the turmoil would be disastrous for the country. \"Unless we can persuade some European power to aid us in establishing some stable government, it is inevitable that the whole of Mexico must be swallowed up by the United States.\" Almonte was a signatory of the Mon-Almonte Convention with Spain in 1859, which ended a period of suspension of diplomatic relations between Spain and Mexico over a debt dispute. The treaty saw Mexico pay debts to the Spaniards in exchange for economic aid against the Mexican Liberals.\n\nOnce overseas, Almonte became involved in the promotion of foreign intervention and monarchical plans for Mexico. His machinations culminated in the French intervention in Mexico. In Paris, with José Hidalgo and José María Gutiérrez de Estrada, an expatriate expelled from Mexico for advocating monarchy, Almonte sought supporters for a new monarchy in Mexico.\n\nHe was also appointed lieutenant of the empire by Maximilian in April 1864, and some weeks later marshal of the empire. He adhered to the fortunes of his imperial patron throughout his short reign, and, when Maximilian was executed, he fled to Europe, spending his last days in exile.\n\nThe town of Almonte, Ontario was named for General Almonte when Canada as well as Mexico were concerned with United States expansionism. The town of Almont, Michigan is also named after him.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A native of Zephyrhills, Florida, he has competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, and Camping World Truck Series. In 2004, he won NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors in the Craftsman Truck Series. He is the son of Buzzie Reutimann.\n\nHe began his racing career in dirt-track modifieds and late models. In 1997, Reutimann moved into the NASCAR regional series before moving to the Busch Series in 2002. He moved up to the Sprint Cup Series in 2007, driving for Michael Waltrip Racing. Between the 2007 and 2011 Sprint Cup seasons, Reutimann recorded two wins, 26 top-tens, and four pole positions.\n\nReutimann lives in Mooresville, North Carolina, with his wife Lisa and daughter Emilia. They are members of Berea Baptist Church in Mooresville.\n\nBefore he was a full-time race car driver, Reutimann worked briefly for the United Parcel Service, which in 2008 became his primary sponsor for the rest of that season.\n\nReutimann, a third-generation racer, began his racing career in dirt-track modifieds and late models before moving up to the Slim Jim All Pro Series in 1997. He was named Rookie of the Year, finishing in the top-ten eight times and had a fifth-place points finish. The next season, he dropped to seventh in points, but received the Sportsmanship award at season's end. After several years, Reutimann got his first three wins in 2002 and finished second in the overall championship standings.\n\nThat same year, Reutimann made his Busch Series debut at Richmond International Raceway. Driving the No. 87 GEICO Chevrolet Monte Carlo for NEMCO Motorsports, Reutimann started thirty-fourth but finished sixteenth. He led twelve laps at his next race at Memphis Motorsports Park, and finished in the top-fifteen in each of his next two races. In 2003, Reutimann won a contest named \"Hills Bros. Coffee Break of a Lifetime\", a contest where Hills Bros. Coffee selected one driver to receive full sponsorship from them for 5 Busch Series races, and if that driver were to score three top 10s in those races, they'd receive a chance to start a Cup race. He ran those 5 races, along with 2 extra races, for NEMCO Motorsports. He finished fifth at Nashville Speedway USA and The Milwaukee Mile, as well as qualifying Greg Biffle's car on the pole at Memphis. He also attempted the New England 300 and the Brickyard 400 in the Winston Cup Series in the No. 04 for Morgan-McClure Motorsports, but failed to qualify both times.\n\nIn 2004, Reutimann signed on with Darrell Waltrip Motorsports to race the NTN Bearings truck in the Craftsman Truck Series. Winning the pole in his second race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Reutimann had four top-fives and finished 14th in points, garnering Rookie of the Year honors. Reutimann won his first career race in 2005 at Nashville Superspeedway, and ended the season thirteenth in points. He also made his Cup debut at Lowe's Motor Speedway, driving the No. 00 State Fair Corn Dogs Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Michael Waltrip. He finished 22nd. He went winless in 2006, but had two poles and finished third in the championship standings. He also made fifteen Busch starts and had four top-tens.\n\nReutimann moved up to the Nextel Cup Series in 2007 with Michael Waltrip Racing, and was a Raybestos Rookie of the Year Candidate.\n\nReutimann edged Kevin Lepage for a transfer spot during the Gatorade Duels into the Daytona 500. However, despite qualifying 14th, he was started from the rear of the field because before the Duels, NASCAR penalized Waltrip's team including Reutimann's for illegal fuel additives in all MWR cars. At the same time the No. 00 car suffered an electrical problem during a wind-down lap. Reutimann ran in the top twenty of the Daytona 500 until he was collected in an accident on lap 173; he eventually finished 40th.\n\nThe following race, at Fontana, Reutimann was involved in a vicious crash. With 4 laps left in the race, Greg Biffle tapped his bumper, sending his car head-on into the wall. Upon impact, the car exploded in flames and slid backwards. The red flag flew, as Reutimann had instantly fallen unconscious. Paramedics came to the wreck, extinguished the flames, and helped a sore, dazed Reutimann out of his racecar. He was airlifted by a helicopter to a hospital. Reutimann suffered a minor concussion, a cracked rib and a few bruises; despite the injuries he returned to the track the next weekend in Mexico City for the Busch series. NASCAR said that Reutimann's accident tied with several other wrecks as the hardest crash in NASCAR history. This record stood until Elliott Sadler crashed at Pocono in 2010.\n\nThe next few weeks after were not very good for Reutimann and the 00 team, failing to qualify at Las Vegas, Bristol, and Texas. However, in the races he did make, he failed to make the top 30 until the tenth race of the season at Richmond, where he finished 28th. After having engine issues at Darlington and failing to qualify for the Coca-Cola 600 and the spring Dover race, along with a disappointing run at Pocono, Reutimann finished in the top 20 for the first time in his Cup career at Michigan, finishing 15th. Despite this, Reutimann was replaced for the races at Sonoma and Watkins Glen by road course ringer P. J. Jones in an attempt to get the #00 to the top 35 positions in owner points.\n\nThe rest of the season would end up repeating a cycle of bad finishes below 30th followed by a good finish above the top 20. After failing to qualify at Bristol, Atlanta, and Phoenix, Reutimann went on to finish the season 39th in points.\n\nLate in the season, he won the 2007 Sam's Town 250 at Memphis Motorsports Park for his first career Busch Series win, and Toyota's second win in Busch Series competition. He finished second overall in the Busch Series' last season before becoming the Nationwide Series.\n\nIn 2008, Reutimann ran the first five races of the season in the No. 00 Aaron's Dream Machine-sponsored car, before taking over for the retiring Dale Jarrett in the No. 44 UPS-sponsored car and handing the No. 00 car over to rookie Michael McDowell. Starting the season out with an 18th place in the Daytona 500, Reutimann started to show improvement over the last season. At Fontana the following week, he finished 23rd before getting 37th at Las Vegas a week later.\n\nIn his first two races in the No. 44 car, Reutimann had mechanical issues, having a suspension issue at Martinsville and getting a blown engine the following week at Texas.\n\nReutimann scored his first career top 10 at Lowe's Motor Speedway during the Coca-Cola 600 with a 10th-place finish. He also recorded top 10's at the Auto Club Speedway, Texas Motor Speedway, and the Richmond International Raceway. At the Richmond race in September, Reutimann led a race high 104 laps, but fell to 9th place. In the season finale at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Reutimann claimed his first career pole position, becoming the 23rd driver to win poles in all three of NASCAR's top series.\n\nIn 2009, Reutimann moved back to the No. 00 car. He competed a limited schedule in the Nationwide Series, splitting time with MWR's No. 99 Toyota Camry and Braun Racing's No. 10 Toyota Camry. During the Daytona 500, Reutimann finished 12th, which would be a new career high at the race. Two weeks later at Las Vegas, Reutimann would score his first top 5, finishing 5th in the race. At Texas, Reutimann would score his first pole of the season, finishing 11th in the race. A week later, at Phoenix, Reutimann would score his 2nd top 10 of the season.\n\nOn May 24, he qualified well in the Coca-Cola 600 but the race was delayed due to rain. The next day on lap 222 his crew chief Rodney Childers made a call to conserve fuel which put Reutimann in the lead. A few laps later on lap 227, a rain shower soaked the track for the second time of the race, red-flagging it with Reutimann in the lead. Reutimann spent a 1-hour wait praying and planning backup plans with boss Michael Waltrip and his pit crew. Despite blue skies being shown nearby the track, officials declared that the rain would last for the remainder of the night and called the race, thus giving Reutimann his first Cup series win in the Coca-Cola 600 and Waltrip giving him a full-time sponsorship until 2011.\n\nWith this emotional victory, Reutimann became the 20th driver to win a race in all three of NASCAR's top series (Cup, Nationwide, and Truck). This race was also the 50th Coca-Cola 600 at Lowes Motor Speedway. He also became the first driver in Cup history to win a race without leading a lap under green. In addition, he was the first driver to ever win with the No. 00 in the NASCAR Cup Series This also entered Reutimann automatically into the 2010 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race. \n\nA week after his victory, Reutimann would win his second pole of the season at Dover, finishing the race in 18th on the lead lap. The next week at Pocono, Reutimann would end up finishing 3rd, and would get another top 5 at Loudon a couple races after. Reutimann would end up getting five more top 10's at Indianapolis, Michigan, Atlanta, Kansas, and Phoenix. Reutimann would go on to finish the season 16th in the point standings, a personal best.\n\nReutimann returned to the No. 00 car during the 2010 season. He would start the season with a personal best finish in the Daytona 500, finishing 5th. Reutimann won his second career race at the 2010 LifeLock.com 400 at Chicagoland Speedway in the No. 00 TUMS MWR Toyota. Reutimann ran in the top-five all night and with under seventy laps remaining, chased down Jeff Gordon and passed him for the lead. He would pull away and lead the rest of the race, holding off a late charge by Carl Edwards.\n\n2011 was a disappointing year for both Reutimann and MWR. Reutimann and the No. 00 team only scored one top five finish and two top ten finishes. At Watkins Glen on the final lap, Boris Said accidentally turned David Ragan entering the esses. Ragan came back onto the track and hit Reutimann, hit the ARMCO outside barrier and he rolled over spectacularly after the hard hit. He was mostly unscathed and Ragan dislocated his ankle as a result.\n\nWith three weeks remaining in the 2011 season, Reutimann could not come to an agreement with Aaron's for 2012 and thus Michael Waltrip and MWR's staff reluctantly released Reutimann from his team as well as the number 00.\n\nAfter Christmas 2011, Reutimann signed up to drive for part-time with Stewart-Haas Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing in 2012 sharing the No. 10 Go Daddy car with rookie Danica Patrick.\n\nOn January 3, 2012, Reutimann signed a one-year contract to drive for Tommy Baldwin Racing. As part of an alliance with Stewart-Haas Racing that TBR agreed to on January 31, Reutimann shared the SHR No. 10 entry, which was fielded by TBR, with Danica Patrick. He also drove the No. 92 RBR Enterprises vehicle in the Camping World Truck Series on a limited schedule. As Patrick drove the No. 10 in the 2012 Daytona 500, Reutimann drove the No. 93 Toyota Camry for BK Racing in the event with Todd Anderson serving as crew chief. Reutimann also drove the BK Racing No. 93 at Darlington.\n\nReutimann caused a controversy at the April Martinsville race when the No. 10 Tommy Baldwin Racing Chevrolet stalled on lap 497, drawing a caution. He was accused of intentionally causing the caution after limping around the track for a few laps at speeds well below the rest of the field. The result was a broken timing belt and Reutimann was credited with a 35th-place finish. He insists he was just trying to keep the car in the Top 35 in owner's points; the team left Martinsville just one point outside a guaranteed start. Reutimann qualified for the next race at Texas and finished 26th, getting the No. 10 back into the Top 35. During Coca-Cola 600 qualifying, David did not qualify fast enough in the No. 73 BK Racing entry and missed his first Cup race since 2007.\n\nReutimann drove the No. 51 Chevrolet for Phoenix Racing at the June Pocono race during the one-race suspension of Kurt Busch for actions detrimental to the sport. Baldwin explained his decision as helping another small team (Reutimann was to drive the No. 10 car that weekend). Reutimann finished 21st. Reutimann qualified and raced for a new team Xxxtreme Motorsports at the fall Phoenix race in the No. 44 No Label Watches Ford, finishing 40th.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, BK Racing announced that Reutimann would drive the No. 83 Toyota during the 2013 season, replacing Landon Cassill. Reutimann started the season a high note, finishing 16th in the Daytona 500. However the team would struggle through the season, not recording another top-20 finish. Reutimann finished 33rd in points. Following the season Reutimann and the team parted ways.\n\nReutimann began the 2014 season without a ride in any of NASCAR's top three divisions, however in March it was announced that he would drive the Sprint Cup No. 35 Ford for Front Row Motorsports at Bristol Motor Speedway. However, he failed to qualify for the event. Reutimann made the field in three of the six Cup races he attempted. It was the last time he ran a NASCAR-sanctioned race.\n\nAfter ending his NASCAR career, Reutimann became a dirt track racing driver and chassis builder, founding Beak Built Chassis to develop UMP modified cars. In 2019, he joined Lee Faulk Racing as the crew chief for late model driver Ryan Rackley.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

However, Busch would beat Peters dramatically by 0.017 to win the race leading the 2010 Mountain Dew 250 at Talladega as the closest truck finish.\n\nPeters ran in the top five early at Iowa in July 2014, but got into an accident with Ron Hornaday Jr. In reply to Hornaday shoving Peters into the outside wall, Peters retaliated and spun Hornaday 2 laps after the previous collision. For his actions NASCAR parked him for the rest of the race, though Peters was too damaged to continue so his parking made no difference in Peters' final result. Peters finished 31st.\n\nFor 2015, Peters got 2 wins, he won from the pole at Talladega for the Fred's 250 and got back to back victories, because he also won the previous year, and would follow up with another win at a wreck filled Phoenix race, the Lucas Oil 150, getting his 10th Truck career win, after Championship contenders Matt Crafton and Erik Jones wrecked while battling for the lead.\n\n2016 saw the first winless season of Peters' full-time truck career, but nonetheless he qualified for the final round of the inaugural Truck chase and finished fourth in the standings.\n\nIn 2017 after a normal start to the year, on May 22 after the Charlotte race, race team owner Tom DeLoach suspended operations of Red Horse Racing effective immediately unless finding of a sponsor. This left Peters and teammate Brett Moffitt without rides; at the time of the team's shutdown, Peters was sixth in points. He drove a single race for MDM Motorsports at Texas Motor Speedway in his last start to date. Out of turn 4 on the second to last lap of the race, Austin Wayne Self got loose and hit the wall. Self then came back down and hit Peters causing him to spin into the grass. The front end dug into the grass and got lifted up in the air. The truck then spun 180 degrees, and the front of the truck came down. This caused the truck to launch 10-20 feet in the air and land on its roof. The truck slid for hundreds of feet and didn't flip back over. He was okay after the crash and finished 13th. Peters drove two races for Young's Motorsports, Las Vegas with an 11th-place finish, and Homestead with a 10th-place finish.\n\nFor the 2018 season, Peters joined RBR Enterprises at Martinsville, finishing seventh. He and the team attempted Charlotte too, but rain ended up canceling qualifying, which sent the team home. It was the first time in his career he failed to qualify for a race.\n\nIn April 2018, he made his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut at Talladega, driving the No. 92 Advance Auto Parts / BB&T Ford Fusion for RBR. Peters and the team came back to Daytona in the summer, but failed to qualify. In late August, he began racing for GMS Racing in the truck series, occupying the No. 25 entry for the team due to the release of Dalton Sargeant. Peters won the Talladega race after avoiding a last lap crash involving Noah Gragson.\n\nIn 2019, Peters signed with Niece Motorsports to run the Truck Series' first three races in the No. 44 Silverado.\n\nPeters married his longtime girlfriend, Sara Haskins Peters, on May 19, 2007. They have two children, a son named Brantley, born in 2012 and Macie, born in 2015.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

It was taken from her debut solo album \"Diva\" and reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"Why\" peaked at No. 34 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was also a big hit internationally, reaching No. 1 in Italy and peaking within the Top 10 in Belgium, Canada, Ireland and five other countries.\n\nJennifer Bowles from \"Associated Press\" described the song as an \"emotional, hypnotizing ballad\". Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" called it a \"soft-yet-vivid ballad that beautifully showcases the rich and distinctive tone of her voice\". He noted that the \"sophisticated nature of track will strain at (and should ultimately knock down) the tight boundaries of top 40 radio.\" Keith Wallace from \"Columbia Daily Spectator\" said that \"Why\" \"wants to be a soulful ballad, but it's so drippy and goofy that it doesn't come anywhere close.\" HuffPost wrote that Lennox' vocal approach \"evokes\" Sting and Paul Simon and added \"she declares, \"This is the book I never read, these are the words I never said, this is the path I'll never tread\", then went on to say, \"These are the dreams I'll dream instead\", making this her sideways stab at creating her own \"My Way\" (as the artist points out in the notes [of her 2009 collection]).\"\n\n\"Music & Media\" commented that Lennox \"confidently goes AC on her first solo effort\" and that the song is \"gently moving and highly polished. She could hardly move farther away from the stirring rock of Eurythmics.\" Kjell Moe from \"Nordlys\" called it \"beautiful and intense\". Pop Rescue noted that \"a soft brushed beat and gentle percussion sit comfortably beneath Annie's sad vocals. This song gently grows, throwing in some extra soft beats, but generally keeps itself a little low-key.\" Nick Griffiths from \"Select\" said that it is \"the sort of tasteful soulful ballady thing you 'd probably expect of her by now, and when the tide of tasteful soulful balladiness swamps her halfway through it's no surprise either.\" \"Slant Magazine\"s Eric Henderson wrote that \"Why\" is \"hardly the sort of melodramatic setting we'd imagine from an album whose very name evokes histrionic pretense. But Annie Lennox isn't and has never been a representative pop diva. Her body is lanky and angular instead of curvaceously plush. Her exaggerated facial features (capped off with a most spectacular set of cheekbones that she wisely never allowed her hair to grow long enough to cover) are matched in androgen-fabulousness only by her tremulously guttural alto.\"\n\nIn 2015, Stereogum ranked \"Why\" at number-one in their list of the 10 best Annie Lennox songs.

She gained considerable popularity in the late 1990s for playing Mimi Bobeck, the outrageously made-up, flamboyantly vulgar, and vindictive nemesis of Drew Carey on the sitcom \"The Drew Carey Show\". She had been involved in television, feature film, and stage work for years.\n\nKinney was born in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, the daughter of Irish American parents Marian and Harold Kinney, an automobile dealer. Her father died when she was 15 years old. \n\nAfter high school, Kathy Kinney worked for the California Conservation Corps between 1972 and 1974. After completing a six-month Back Country season in Kings Canyon, she left the program with thousands of dollars in scholarships. She attended the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point in the 70’s and officially received her degree in 2016. In 1976 she moved to New York City, where she found work as a secretary at WCBS-TV. Her boss enjoyed hunting, and sometimes she chatted with him about his hunting trips, occasionally quipping, \"So, did you kill anything this week?\" She used this experience to inspire herself for the role of Mimi. During this time at WCBS she worked nights at New York comedy clubs to improve her improvisational comedy skills. This \nled to a job teaching improv classes. Bill Sherwood, a director, attended. He later wrote a part for her in his 1986 film, \"Parting Glances\".\n\nArmed with the success of \"Parting Glances,\" Kinney visited friends in Los Angeles, and decided to permanently move there to pursue a career in acting. In L.A., Kinney worked hard as a character actress, getting small roles in various TV series such as \"Seinfeld\" (Season 4, Episode 22, \"The Handicap Spot),\" \"\" (with Drew Carey, with whom she would work again in \"The Drew Carey Show\"), \"Grace Under Fire,\" \"Full House,\" \"Boy Meets World,\" \"The Larry Sanders Show,\" and \"My Name Is Earl.\" Her first memorable television role is generally considered her regular stint on \"Newhart\" as Miss Goddard, the town librarian (1989–1990).\n\nKinney has avoided auditions for what she calls \"the heavy-girl roles\". Critics occasionally grumble that Mimi, her character on \"The Drew Carey Show\", is a waddling fat joke, but her weight has never seemed to be the point of a fat joke. \"One time I had to say to Drew, 'Aw, you're just fat,' as the ultimate put-down. I personally don't like it, but if fat jokes slip in because they're funny, I don't care.\" She is, however, less comfortable about being typecast because of her weight. \"Once in a while I would lose some weight, just by accident, and someone would say to me, 'You're going to diet yourself out of a career,'\" she says. \"And I tell them, 'I'm losing weight, not my talent.' Why is it the first thing [some people] look at is the shape? It points up to me the prejudice that still exists.\" The Mimi Bobeck character was written only into the pilot of \"The Drew Carey Show\". The character interviewed for a cosmetics job at Winfred-Louder and when not hired, because of her garish makeup, raised a big fuss and threatened to sue. Positive public reaction prompted the Mimi storyline to continue, as the store hired her as a secretary to prevent her from suing. The show aired from 1995 to 2004.\n\nKinney has also appeared in the American version of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", again working with Drew Carey.\n\nIn addition to her television roles, Kinney has appeared in several movies, including \"Arachnophobia\", \"Stanley & Iris\", \"Scrooged\", \"Three Fugitives\", \"Lenny the Wonder Dog\", and \"This Boy's Life\". In 2006 she visited Iraq with former co-star Drew Carey and his Improv All-Star Team, a series of USO performance for American troops; film of her appearance appears in the documentary \"\".\n\nIn 2008, Kinney became the co-creator and star of MrsP.com, an entertainment website for children. Kinney portrays Mrs. P, an eccentric redhead who loves books and reads classic children's stories from her magical library. After nearly two years in development, the site launched in beta on November 10, 2008.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, Kinney appeared in character as Mimi in the beginning of \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". A week later (April Fools' Day), Kinney reprised her role as Mimi during that day's \"The Price Is Right\", hosted by Carey, appearing as a guest model. She repeated the role on April Fool's Day 2010, this time usurping the post of executive producer. She replaced the show's announcer with a man in a monkey suit along with using 4 male models.\n\nShe guest starred on \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" as Rhonda the walrus, Marlene's disgusting roommate, in the 2009 episode \"Roomies.\" Rhonda made a second appearance in the episode \"The Hoboken Surprise\" in 2011.\n\nIn March 2010, Kinney co-authored with Cindy Ratzlaff a book entitled \"Queen of Your Own Life: The Grown-up Woman's Guide to Claiming Happiness and Getting the Life You Deserve\", published by Harlequin.\n\nKinney also guest-starred on \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager.\" Beginning in March 2011, Kinney appeared in \"Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza.\"\n\nIn September 2019, Kinney appeared on \"American Housewife.\" She played the lunch lady in the episode \"Bigger Kids, Bigger Problems\" and she reunites with former co-stars Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles and Diedrich Bader as part of ABC's Cast from the Past Week.\n"}

{"id": "2191002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191002", "title": "2005 Egyptian presidential election", "text": "2005 Egyptian presidential election\n\nThe Egyptian presidential election of 2005, held on September 7, 2005, was the first allegedly contested presidential election in Egypt's history. Hosni Mubarak, the former President of Egypt, won a fifth consecutive six-year term in office, with official results showing he won 88.6% of the vote. Mubarak's opponent, Ayman Nour, of the Tomorrow Party, is estimated to have received 7.3% of the vote and Numan Gumaa received 2.8%, however, Nour claimed that prior polling results showed over 30%. Criticism of the election process has centred on the process of selecting the eligible candidates, and on alleged election-law violations during voting. Mubarak was sworn in for his new term on September 27.\n\nThe election was the first-ever multi-party election in the history of Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian rule. Ten parties were set to take part; the leading candidates were:\nAlso contending were:\n\nUntil recently, Egyptians have only been able to approve or reject a candidate appointed by parliament, which is dominated by Hosni Mubarak's NDP.\n\nMubarak had been re-elected four times during his 24-year rule by such a referendum. Mubarak won the 1999 referendum with almost 94% of the vote, though turnout was probably around 10%.\n\nA constitutional amendment approved in a referendum in May 2005 opened the way for multi-candidate presidential elections.\n\nUnder Egyptian election law, all Egyptians over age eighteen are required to vote. However, out of a population of approximately 77,500,000 (the largest in the Arab world), only about 32 million voters were registered (approximately 40% of the total population).\n\nUnder the election law, parties proposed candidates for the election, which were reviewed by the Presidential Election Commission. Of the 30 proposed candidates, only 10 were allowed to participate in the presidential election by the Presidential Election Commission. One prominent candidate not allowed to run was Talaat Sadat, the nephew of former President Anwar Sadat, who appealed his disqualification unsuccessfully.\n\nEgypt's largest Islamic group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was not permitted to field a candidate for the election because the organization is banned by the government, which prohibits political parties with a stated religious agenda. The Brotherhood did not back any of the other candidates, but they encouraged Egyptians to go to the polls and vote for anyone other than Mubarak.\n\nThe election campaign kicked off on August 17, 2005 and lasted until September 4, 2005. While many believed Hosni Mubarak's re-election a foregone conclusion, he campaigned seriously, trying to win votes across Egypt.\n\n9,865 polling places were open until 10:00 p.m. Wednesday, September 7, so that voters could cast their ballots. Full results were not expected until at least Thursday September 8.\n\nThe election was overseen by Egyptian judges. No international monitors were allowed to oversee the election.\n\nAccording to a late August report by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, media coverage was biased in favour of Hosni Mubarak.\n\nIf no candidate had received 50% of the vote, the top two candidates would have contested a second election scheduled for September 17.\n\nSome of the main legal opposition parties, including the leftist Tagammu Party and the Nasserist Party, boycotted the election, saying it was unlikely to be free or fair. Those opposing the election said the electoral reforms had not gone far enough because the election regulations severely restricted independent candidates and overwhelmingly favoured the NDP.\n\nSecondly, the Muslim Brotherhood, believed to be the most popular opposition group in Egypt, was excluded from running in the elections because Mubarak's government had made it officially illegal and barred from major political processes. Supporters of the Brotherhood and other opposition parties stated that this undermined the credibility of the election.\n\nIn addition, there appeared to be official harassment of the leading opposition candidate Nour, who was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested on January 2005, on what many observers regarded as trumped-up charges. He was imprisoned for a short time that year before public and international outcry resulted in his release before trial.\n\nThe New Wafd Party and the Tomorrow (Ghad) Party contested the election even though they had opposed the May 2005 constitutional referendum, and their respective candidates, Numan Gumaa and Ayman Nour, drew significant support—Nour won 12% and Gumaa won 5-7%.\n\nMedia reports on September 8, based on anonymous statements from election commission officials, stated that preliminary results showed President Hosni Mubarak winning 78% - 80% of the vote and Ayman Nour winning 12%. Gumaa was reported as receiving 5-7%.\n\nLate reports from September 8 placed Mubarak's numbers at approximately 72%, based once again on anonymous sources.\n\nThe official result, that Mubarak won the election with 88.6% of the vote, was announced on September 9, 2005. Detailed results, with results and voting breakdowns by province for 15 of the 26 provinces (not including the largest provinces), were published in Al-Ahram, a state newspaper. The same source states that Nour won 6.2% in the 15 provinces, 20% in the Nile delta province of Buheira, and 16% in Alexandria.\n\nFollowing widespread reports of election law violations, Nour immediately demanded a rerun of the election. However, the Presidential Election Commission rejected his request as baseless on September 8, 2005, a decision that cannot be appealed. Nour's campaign manager, Wael Nawara, noted the Nour camp's surprise that the Presidential Election Commission would reject Nour's claims \"despite the coverage from the media and the repetitive nature of these complaints.\"\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal stated that the elections show that Mubarak has democratic intentions and that elections can take place there without harming stability: \"The poll that took place in Egypt refutes the case made by those who claim Egypt is unstable and question its march toward the future.\"\n\nUnited States State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that the United States saw this election as a \"historic departure\" and the debate during the election process would \"enrich the Egyptian political dialogue, certainly for years to come.\" McCormack also stated that \"the Egyptian security services showed discipline in ensuring safety and security\" and praised the \"relative calm\" of Election Day.\n\nHowever, McCormack criticized the lack of international monitors and the late decision to allow monitors, as well as the lack of media access that prevented opposition candidates from getting their message out. As for election day itself, he stated that \"there were reports of some irregularities at polling places in terms of campaign posters or t-shirts being seen at the actual polling place and a variety of other issues.\" The United States expressed its hope that \"the Egyptian Government and the Egyptian people can build upon this positive first step in holding this multi-candidate presidential election and build on the positive experiences, the positive actions in this election, as they look towards parliamentary elections in the fall time and look to addressing some of those issues that I mentioned that were less positive.\"\n\nThough support for Mubarak is significant and he was expected to win by a wide margin, charges of widespread confusion, ballot stuffing, vote-buying, intimidation, and other forms of voter fraud marred the election on September 7, 2005.\n\nThe Mubarak government initially stated that turnout was high, though numbers varied. Surprisingly, on September 9, the government released results and turnout figures that were low and may have been accurate, as low in some places as 19%.\n\nOn September 8, however, an election official and Mubarak's campaign both stated that it was around 30%.\n\nBoth on election day and afterwards, election monitoring groups stated that turnout was low, reportedly because ordinary Egyptians thought the outcome a foregone conclusion.\n\nOn September 8, anonymous sources stated turnout in Alexandria, the second-largest city in Egypt, was 17%, and turnout in Ismaïlia (a city of about 750,000) was about 24%, with Mubarak taking more than 80% of the vote.\n\nWael Namara, a spokesman for Ayman Nour of the Tomorrow Party, estimated turnout to be between 10 and 15% in the countryside and from 3 to 5% in the cities.\n\nIn previous elections, voter turnout has run at less than 10 percent. Voter turnout in the May 2005 referendum that allowed the presidential election was officially reported as 54%, but judges monitoring the elections said it was more like 3%.\n\nAllegations of election law violations surfaced during the voting. News media reported that Mubarak's National Democratic Party transported voters to the polls by bus, and allegedly did not allow voters to mark their choices behind a curtain, an essential requirement of a secret ballot. Polling stations in Cairo were plastered with Mubarak posters and members of the NDP hovered over voters, taking ballots from voters and handing them to polling station officials.\n\nAyman Nour of the Tomorrow Party, one of the most prominent opposition candidates, along with others, has accused the government of not using truly indelible ink on the hands of voters, allowing voters favoring Hosni Mubarak to remove stamps indicating they had voted and return to vote again. Indelible ink was used only in major boxes, while non-permanent ink was used in many other boxes. There were rumors of certain voters that had no ink at all which would make voter fraud even less difficult. Nour also alleged that there was widespread vote-buying, a charge supported by the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, though not otherwise corroborated.\n\nThe Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, while supporting Nour's claims, has stated that the irregularities were insufficient to require a rerun of the election.\n\nOn September 7, 2005, men in plainclothes broke up a Cairo protest by the Kefaya movement calling for Egyptians to boycott the elections, beating some of the protesters. Media sources state that as many as three thousand Kifaya protesters illegally marched on central Cairo, possibly the largest crowd ever drawn by that protest movement, while armed soldiers and police watched.\n\nAt 10:00 a.m. on September 7, two hours after the start of the election, Egypt's Presidential Election Commission unexpectedly stated that it would allow civil society groups to monitor the election. However, in many cases they were not allowed into polling places and were beaten and interrogated, especially in Southern Egypt.\n\nThese citizen monitors were in addition to the Egyptian judges who have been allowed to independently monitor the elections.\n\nA larger protest of around 10,000 people was organized by Kifaya on September 10, 2005, to contest the election results and the mass rigging activities and cheating that occurred on the election day. It was reported by independent observers, reporters and candidate representatives that the NDP (Mubarak's Party) used government resources to change the election results. In some cases, citizens were beaten or forced to vote for Mubarak. In other cases, the boxes were already filled with marked ballots. However, the most explicit action that provoked the protest was allowing pro-Mubarak voters only to vote without being previously registered in the voter lists, giving Mubarak between 20 and 30 extra illegal points in the results.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2191017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191017", "title": "Access Communications", "text": "Access Communications\n\nAccess Communications is a Canadian telecommunications service provider operating in over 235 communities in Saskatchewan. Headquartered in Regina, the co-operative provides internet, cable television, telephone and security services to residential and business customers. Its primary competitor is Saskatchewan's government-owned SaskTel.\n\nAccess Communications was established in 1974 as the Regina Cablevision Co-operative. After a prolonged legal and constitutional dispute between the federal and the provincial governments, which had differing visions of how cable television should be delivered in the province, the co-operative was granted a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licence for broadcast in 1976 and began providing cable television services as Cable Regina on February 14, 1978. More than 24,000 households in Regina signed up for cable services in its first years of operations.\n\nAfter nearly two decades focusing solely on cable television and local broadcasting, the co-operative launched dial-up internet service in September 1995 and cable modem broadband service followed in 1997. Cable Regina diversified and extended its reach into other areas of the province in the 1990s through the acquisition of other cable television providers in Regina Beach, White City, Weyburn, Estevan and Yorkton. On April 17, 2000, the co-operative's name changed to Access Communications. In the early 2000s, Access Communications merged with the Battlefords Community Cablevision. Primary line telephone services were launched in 2007.\n\nLooking to further expand its presence in smaller communities, Access Communications purchased Persona's cable operations in Saskatchewan from Halifax-based Eastlink in 2009, becoming the largest cable television provider in the province. In 2015, Access Communications acquired Askivision and Saskatoon-based Little Loon Wireless; the purchase of the latter allowed the co-operative to deliver fixed-wireless broadband high-speed internet to rural areas in Saskatchewan.\n\nAccess Communications offers cable modem and fixed-wireless broadband internet, cable television (digital and analog), telephone, home security and home automation.\n\nAccess Communications uses a hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) network infrastructure to deliver its internet services. On March 2019, it announced that it is one of the internet service providers participating in the federal government's Connecting Families Program.\n\nAccess Communications distributes standard definition and high-definition cable television programming, including digital cable. It offers digital video recorders such as TiVo, video-on-demand services and has implemented switched digital video (SDV) technology in many markets.\n\nAccess Communications' digital phone service was launched in February 2007 and utilizes IP technology instead of a traditional landline. Such a system operates on an ATA (Analog Telephony Adapter) device with a built-in cable modem. The modem communicates over cable lines to a private IP network. In this sense, it can be considered VoIP, in that it is voice delivered over an IP network. However, because it travels over dedicated lines, it is still designed to be usable in a power outage scenario.\n\nThe co-operative offers home security and home automation services. In 2016, an Alarm.com-based home automation monitored service was introduced. Subscribers can secure and monitor their property through web-based and mobile applications, as well as through Apple, Amazon and Google devices.\n\nAccess Communications broadcasts the Access7 community channel in 100 communities and airs a variety of locally produced shows and events, including shows highlighting multicultural, Indigenous and LGBTQ2S+ perspectives in Saskatchewan. Its sports coverage includes broadcasts of the Regina Pats and other Western Hockey League games. Its first agreement with the Western Hockey League was signed in 1993.\n\nAccess Communications operates as a not-for-profit co-operative and its brand focuses on its community-based ownership, reinvesting its revenues on service improvements, as well as promoting and supporting local events and community organizations. It has a charity, the Access Communications Children's Fund, as well as a scholarship program. In 2019, the co-operative supported close to 2,000 community groups and was recognized as one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers, one of Saskatchewan Top 100 Companies and was named a Caring Company by Imagine Canada in 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "2191021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191021", "title": "Bellingen, New South Wales", "text": "Bellingen, New South Wales\n\nBellingen is a small town on Waterfall Way on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia. It is approximately halfway between the major Australian cities of Sydney and Brisbane. It is the seat of Bellingen Shire and has a mixture of valley, plateau and coastal environments.\n\nThe township lies on the Bellinger River. In 1841, Government surveyor Clement Hodgkinson visited the area. When naming newly discovered places, he preferred to use existing native place names rather than foreign ones, so he used the Gumbaynggir name for river, \"Billingen\" as the name of the area. The name has also been reported as meaning \"clean water\", \"winding river\", \"quoll\" and \"cheeky fellow\". Originally, Bellingen was pronounced \"Billingen\", where the \"ng\" was pronounced as in \"sing\".\n\nWhen it came time to write the word, the Aboriginal voice and the European ear combined to give a spelling of \"Billingen\", \"Billengen\", \"Bellengen\" or \"Bellingen\". European usage has altered the original pronunciation to the current \"Bellin-jen\".\n\nTo further confuse the issue, a draughtsman who was compiling the Colony map from original documents misread Hodgkinson's final handwritten \"n\" as an \"r\"; meaning that the Bellingen River officially became the \"Bellinger\", while the town retained the correct name of \"Bellingen\".\n\nThe Bellinger Valley including Bellingen was first settled by Kooris – the Gumbaynggir people – long before European settlement. The first European into the Bellinger Valley was the stockman William Myles who arrived in 1840 looking for new valleys north of Kempsey and the Macleay River. The following year Myles, accompanied by Surveyor Clement Hodgkinson explored the valley and by 1842 there were cedar cutters at the mouth of the Bellinger River and sheep grazing in the valley. In July 1843 the first cargo of red cedar from the Bellinger valley was transported to Sydney. So determined were the local Aborigines to keep the cedar cutters and explorers off their land that they regularly attacked the cedar cutters camps and when Hodgkinson returned to the valley he was accompanied by members of the Yarrahappinni group who he hoped would explain his 'innocent' intentions to the locals. In 1845 it was estimated that there were 300 Aborigines living in the Bellinger Valley.\n\nThe growth of cedar cutting throughout the 1840s was dramatic with 20 pit sawers operating along the river by 1843 and, by 1849, the first timber vessel, the 'Minerva', being built by a shipwright named William Darbyshire. The cedar was hauled down to the river by teams of bullocks or horses. So rich was the area in cedar that it was estimated that over 2 million feet of cedar were being extracted each year.\n\nIn 1864 a site was set apart and reserved for the village of Bellingen. The town allotments were surveyed in 1869 and were sold by public auction at West Kempsey Court House on Sep 14 1870, the deeds in every case describing the land as in the village of Bellingen\n\nIn the 1890s, Bellingen was selected as the government centre of the valley, due to its location at the tidal limit of the Bellinger River and the availability of fresh water. A period of rapid growth ensued.\n\nBy the early 1900s, red cedar supplies were virtually depleted, except for those that survived in the inaccessible upper reaches of the Bellinger Valley. The cleared areas were turned into prime farming land and the valley became a dairying centre. The indigenous population had been decimated by disease and inability to move across the land to locate traditional food supplies, and many were killed in their bid to drive away the cedar getters and new settlers from traditional Gumbaynggir land. 'Black Jimmy' is reported to be the last full-blood member of the Bellinger Gumbaynggir People. Black Jimmy died in 1922 and is buried in Bellingen Cemetery. The Gumbaynggir People still live in the area of Bellingen.\n\nThe dairy industry crashed in the 1960s with the rise of the European Common Market, when export prices fell (with Britain no longer relying on Australian dairy products) and the margarine industry finally overcame laws restricting its production levels. Dairy farming still continues to a lesser extent.\n\nRainforest logging ceased altogether in 1975. Sclerophyll forest logging is still carried out, but to a much lesser extent than in the past.\n\nIn 1950, Bellingen came to national fame with the birth of the Sara Quads (Sara family quadruplets). From the 1970s until the present, alternative life-stylers purchased land in the area and built owner-built homes. Numerous intentional communities were established, many of which are still in existence. The rural lifestyle of Bellingen and surrounds has consequently diverged and is now a mix of traditional and non-traditional farming. Many of today's residents, such as artists, craftspeople, writers, musicians and horticulturalists, have established home-based activities.\n\nBellingen has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,074 people in Bellingen.\n\nOwing to high rainfall and its proximity to the valleys of the Bellinger and Kalang rivers, Bellingen is known for its frequent flooding. Tallowood Point near Bellingen often has the State's highest annual rainfall.\nthe Bellingens Lavender Bridge also gets flooded often\n\nBellingen was one of the filming locations for the 2003 comedy film \"Danny Deckchair\", written and directed by Jeff Balsmeyer. Bellingen was also the notional setting of the book \"Oscar and Lucinda\" written by Booker Prize winning author Peter Carey. The film version of the novel \"Eucalyptus\" was scheduled to be filmed in Bellingen as well before it fell through.\n\nBellingen has a strong affinity with the arts and is home to numerous festivals: historically the popular Global Carnival (often known simply as \" The Global\"), the Bellingen Jazz and Blues Festival, and the current Camp Creative, the Bellingen Music Festival (classical music), Bello Winter Music Festival and the Bellingen Readers and Writers Festival, held for the first time in 2011. The first and original festival, an annual event, was the Azalea Festival, which included a procession of floats, the local brass band and pipeband, and various community organisations marching down Hyde Street to the cheers and applause of the spectators.\n\nBellingen also hosts the twice yearly Plant Fairs as a fundraiser for the Bellingen Environment Centre. These fairs attract thousands of visitors to the town and the 70+ stall-holders provide information and sell bushland-friendly Australian native, food-bearing and landscape plants and heirloom seeds, garden equipment, furniture and supplies to provide local food, and habitat for native birds and animals.\n\nTourism has been encouraged in recent years by the cafe, market, festival and motorcycling culture. More recently, there has been an annual meet for Harley Davidson enthusiasts riding from Queensland and regional NSW. This annual meet has been organised by a local motorcycling enthusiast which sees riders converging at the Diggers Tavern for accommodation and then riding the scenic roads in the region.\n\n\n\n"}

It was commanded by Paul Hausser during the Third Battle of Kharkov and the Battle of Kursk in 1943 and by Wilhelm Bittrich on the Western Front in 1944.\n\nThe II SS Panzer Corps was formed from SS Division Leibstandarte, SS Division Das Reich and SS Division Totenkopf in July 1942 as the SS Panzer Corps. In August, it was sent to northern France before taking part in the Case Anton, the occupation of Vichy France in November, during which it captured Toulon. In early February 1943, the corps, under the command of SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser, was attached to Army Group South in Ukraine and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov.\n\nThe corps was renamed II SS Panzer Corps in June 1943, after the I SS Panzer Corps was created during that same month. In July 1943, the corps took part in the failed Operation Citadel, spearheading 4th Panzer Army's attack in the southern sector. The corps' three SS divisions were involved in the Battle of Prokhorovka at the edge of the German penetration into the salient. After the operation was canceled in light of its failure, the corps was ordered to the Italian front in August. Only one division, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ended up being transferred, along with the corps personnel. The remaining combat divisions remained on the Eastern Front to deal with the developing threats from the Soviet Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation. Leibstandarte took part in operations to disarm Italian troops.\n\nBetween 20 September and 20 of November 1943 the corps conducted operations against Yugoslav Partisans in order to establish a connection with Army Group F in the Balkans and to secure communications east and northwards from Trieste and Rijeka. In these operations, according to the Corps Headquarters' Medical Department, the corps suffered total losses of 936 men. According to Croat authors, in the first phase against partisans on Istrian peninsula (Unternehmen Istrien), some 2000 partisans and 2000 civilians were killed by German forces, and additional 1200 were arrested, with some 400 transported to concentration camps. In November, 1943, Leibstandarte returned to the Soviet Union, with the corps remaining in Slovenia, Istria and northern Italy. \n\nIn January 1944, the corps was ordered to the Alençon area of France to refit.\n\nIn late March-early April 1944, the corps, alongside other reinforcements, was sent from France to the Eastern Front, where it played the main role in de-blockading the encircled 1st Panzer Army in the Kamenets-Podolsky Pocket, also known as Hube Pocket. It was the first major transfer of forces from France to the East since the creation of the Führer Directive 51, which no longer allowed any transfers from the West to the East. \n\nAfter rescuing the better part of the 1st Panzer Army, the corps then participated in the attempt to de-blockade the trapped German garrison of the 4th Panzer Army in the town of Tarnopol, which was declared to be fortress (Festung) by the Germans. However, the Red Army had prepared defenses there and the relief operation ultimately failed. After this, the corps was moved into the reserve of the newly created Army Group North Ukraine. \n\nIn mid-June 1944, the corps was ordered west to take part in the Battle of Normandy, arriving to the invasion front in late June 1944. \n\nThe corps was involved in heavy fighting against the British 21st Army Group in the Battle of Caen. During this period, SS-Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich was placed in command of the corps. In August 1944, the corps participated in the battles in and around the Falaise Pocket. The corps then retreated across France. On 17 September 1944, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden, an airborne offensive aimed at capturing the Rhine bridge at Arnhem. The corps was involved in fighting against the British 1st Airborne Division in the Battle of Arnhem and also against the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and British XXX Corps in Nijmegen.\n\nIn preparation for the , the corps was placed in reserve of 6th SS Panzer Army and committed on 21 December 1944 near St. Vith. After the northern assault stalled, the corps was transferred south to take part in the attack on Bastogne. The corps' divisions suffered heavy losses in the battles against the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. After the operation's failure, the corps returned to the defensive, seeing action against American forces in the Eifel region.\n\nIn February 1945, the corps was ordered to Hungary to take part in an offensive to recapture Budapest and the Hungarian oilfields. The corps took part in Operation Spring Awakening, launched near Lake Balaton on 6 March 1945. After the failure of the offensive, the corps retreated, alongside the I SS and IV SS Panzer Corps, towards Vienna. After the Soviet forces captured the city, individual units attempted to break out to the west. The elements of the corps surrendered to the U.S. Army on 8 May 1945.\n\n\nJuly 1943 – Operation Citadel\n\nSeptember 1943\n\nOctober 1943\n\nSeptember 1944 - Operation Market Garden\n\nMarch 1945 - Operation Frühlingserwachen\n\n"}

In this comedy, a 12th-century knight and his squire travel in time to the end of the 20th century and find themselves adrift in modern society.\n\n\"Les Visiteurs\" was the Number 1 box office film in France in 1993, with 13,782,846 ticket sales and was the highest-grossing non-English language film worldwide that year. It remains, in 2019, the fifth highest grossing French film ever. The publicity for the film used the tagline \"Ils ne sont pas nés d'hier\" (\"They weren't born yesterday\"). Reno and Clavier reprised their roles in a sequel in 1998, the American remake \"Just Visiting\" in 2001 and a in 2016. The castle of Ermenonville, in Oise département, served as decoration for the castle of Montmirail in the current time and the Cité de Carcassonne for medieval period.\n\nIn the year 1123, Godefroy Amaury de Malfête, Count of Apremont and Papincourt, saves the life of his beloved sovereign, King Louis VI \"Le Gros\" (\"\"The Fat\"\") from the sword of a \"horribilis\" Englishman.\n\nFor this action of bravery, the King makes him Count of Montmirail and promises him the woman he loves, the beautiful Frénégonde de Pouille. On his way to the castle to marry Frénégonde, Godefroy takes a witch prisoner, and she drugs his drinking flask. Hallucinating, he believes the Duke of Pouille, father of his future wife, is a ferocious bear, and kills him with a crossbow bolt. During the Duke's funeral, Frénégonde refuses to marry Godefroy because of the tragedy; meanwhile, Godefroy's servant, the disreputable Jacquouille la Fripouille, steals the Duke's jewels at end of the funeral.\n\nIn an attempt to repair his mistake, Godefroy asks the wizard Eusebius to send him back in time to a moment before he shot the Duke. The old wizard muddles his magical spell, accidentally sending Godefroy and Jacquouille to the year 1992. There, they immediately run into trouble. Godefroy attacks a postman driving his car, mistaking him for a Moor in a devil's chariot; when he meets his descendant, Béatrice de Montmirail, an aristocrat who looks exactly like Frénégonde, she calls the Gendarmerie, who first imprison him, then as Béatrice thinks Godefroy is her distant cousin suffering from amnesia, take him to a mental hospital. Jacquouille, meanwhile, is befriended by Ginette la Clocharde (\"Ginette the Tramp\" in French), an attractive vagrant they meet early in their adventure.\n\nBéatrice, thinking Godefroy to be her long-lost stuntman cousin Hubert, gets Godefroy out of the mental hospital and takes them back to her home, much to her husband (who greatly dislikes the fact of the two being in their home) Jean-Pierre's dismay. There, various culture-shock comedy ensues as Godefroy and Jacquouille attempt to fathom modern household appliances, such as flooding the bathroom by leaving the tap open, using an umbrella as a pike to roast a chicken and setting it on fire, washing their hands in the toilet, trashing the bathroom during their baths and wasting all of the family's 6,000 FF Chanel No. 5, greatly angering Jean-Pierre.\n\nSeeing the family seal on Godefroy's hand, Beatrice assumes he stole the jewel from the castle de Montmirail, now renovated into an expensive hotel. They go there and meet the owner of the castle, the effete Jacques-Henri Jacquard, the unwitting descendant and close likeness of Jacquouille (they react to each other with mutual disgust). The jewel on Godefroy's hand starts to burn as they get closer to the castle, where the present-day version of the seal is. The two seals explode and destroy Jacquard's brand new Range Rover.\n\nGodefroy books a room for the night and reopens a secret passage known only to him. There he finds a letter telling him to go to a certain address, where an aged Monsieur Ferdinand, the last descendant of the wizard Eusebius, gives him the potion that will return him to the year 1123. Jacquouille, however, wants to stay, enjoying Ginette's company and having proved more adaptable than Godefroy in discovering toothpaste, modern clothing and other amenities of the future. Furious at his behavior, Godefroy finally brings him to the hotel room by force.\n\nWhile Godefroy is talking with Béatrice, Jacquouille swaps jackets with his descendant, closes the curtains, dims the lights, drugs Jacquard and puts him on the bed in his place. In the dark, Godefroy gives Jacquard (thinking it is Jacquouille) the potion which then sends him back to the year 1123. Godefroy equally comes back just in time to stop himself from shooting Frénégonde's father, and the deflected crossbow bolt kills the witch who caused the whole misadventure by drugging Godefroy's flask. The bewildered Jacquard finds himself stranded in the past in the role of Godefroy's servant as Godefroy leaves on horseback with Frénégonde.\n\n\n\nA sequel, \"\" followed in 1998, and an American remake, \"Just Visiting\", made with the same stars, was released in 2001.

He is remembered today for his taxonomic work on the fauna of Siberia and for his attempts to establish relations between Imperial Russia and Tokugawa Japan.\n\nIn 1757, Laxmann started his studies at the Academy of Åbo and was subsequently ordained a Lutheran priest in St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia. In 1764, he was appointed as a preacher in a small parish in Barnaul in central Siberia, whence he undertook a number of exploratory journeys, reaching Irkutsk, Baikal, Kiakhta and the border to China. His collection of material on the fauna of Siberia made him famous in scientific circles and in 1770, he was appointed professor of chemistry and economy at the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1769, Laxmann was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1780, Laxmann settled in Irkutsk, where he would spend much of the rest of his life. In 1782, Laxmann founded a museum in Irkutsk, which is the oldest in Siberia.\nLaxmann also ran a glass factory in a suburb of Irkutsk, around 6 versts (24 kilometers) away from the center of the city with a famous merchant Alexander Andreyevich Baranov as a business partner; the factory was roughly 36 metres (20 \"ken\") square. Products were not only sold domestically, but also to northeastern China.\n\nAlthough he had many connections to local people of importance, Laxmann developed an antagonistic relationship with Grigory Shelikhov, a seafarer and merchant. Laxmann noticed that Shelikhov, along with the Irkutsk Governor-General's Office had tried to pressure Daikokuya Kōdayū, a Japanese castaway, into staying in Russia and serving as a translator for the merchant. The fact that Shelikhov also had strong connections with some Russian bureaucrats made the situation more complex. After Laxmann went to St.Petersburg on Kodayu's behalf, he began to send letters directly to Grand Chancellor Alexander Bezborodko (due to the Chancellor's high position, the use of intermediaries was normally required).\n\nLaxmann already had some knowledge about Japan before he met Japanese castaways, reading books written by Carl Peter Thunberg, with whom Laxmann had some communication.\n\nIn 1789, while doing research in Irkutsk, Laxmann came across six Japanese who had been found in Amchitka, one of the Aleutian Islands, by Russian furriers whose leader was a person called Nivizimov. Laxmann escorted the castaways to St. Petersburg, where Daikokuya Kōdayū, their nominal leader, pleaded with Empress Catherine the Great to be allowed to return to Japan. During this stay in the capital, Laxmann began discussions on various matters with Alexander Bezborodko, but succumbed to a bout of typhoid fever which left him incapacitated for three months.\n\nLaxmann recovered consciousness in early May when Catherine had just moved to Tsarskoye Selo for the summer. Laxmann sent Kodayu to Tsarskoye Selo ahead of him, and Kodayu was able to meet with the Empress several times over six months, as a result of Laxman's dedicated efforts among the Russian bureaucracy, especially with Alexander Bezborodko and chancellor Alexander Vorontsov. At each presentation at Tsarskoye Selo, Laxmann walked along with Kodayu in order to assist him in the proper etiquette required in the Empress' presence.\n\nIn 1791, Catherine agreed to a plan conceived by Laxman, under which Laxman's son, Lt. Adam Laxman would command a voyage to Japan, where he would exchange the castaways for economic agreements and concessions. Grigory Shelikhov had proposed another plan that would make the Japanese castaways Russian citizens so that they would be Japanese teachers and translators, but Catherine chose Laxmann and Bezborodko's plan. The elder Laxmann remained in Russia while his son traveled with the castaways.\n\nLaxmann wrote letters to two Japanese scholars, Nakagawa Junan and Katsuragawa Hoshū, at the recommendation of Carl Peter Thunberg, their teacher. There is no record that the letters ever reached the scholars, even though Adam Laxmann handed the letters to Ishikawa Tadafusa, a staff member of Tokugawa Shogunate, in Matsumae, Hokkaidō. Erik Laxmann had showed Kodayu the letters before Kodayu left Okhotsk.\nKatsuragawa Hoshu had lots of communication with Kodayu after Kodayu lived in Yedo so Hoshu edited some books on Russia and Kodayu's experience. It would be possible to think that Hoshu may have known that Laxmann had sent him a letter.\n\nLaxmann had a wife, Yekaterina Ivanovna, five sons, Gustav, Adam, one who died young, Afernaci and Martin and a daughter Mariya. He also lived with his younger brother, his wife and their two daughters, Anna and Elizabeta. Laxmann also had another younger brother, who lived in St. Petersburg.\n\n"}
{"id": "2191091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191091", "title": "Post-perovskite", "text": "Post-perovskite\n\nPost-perovskite (pPv) is a high-pressure phase of magnesium silicate (MgSiO). It is composed of the prime oxide constituents of the Earth's rocky mantle (MgO and SiO), and its pressure and temperature for stability imply that it is likely to occur in portions of the lowermost few hundred km of Earth's mantle.\n\nThe post-perovskite phase has implications for the \"D\"′′ layer, which influences the convective mixing in the mantle responsible for plate tectonics.\n\nPost-perovskite has the same crystal structure as the synthetic solid compound CaIrO, and is often referred to as the \"CaIrO-type phase of MgSiO\" in the literature. The crystal system of post-perovskite is orthorhombic, its space group is \"Cmcm\", and its structure is a stacked SiO-octahedral sheet along the \"b\" axis. The name \"post-perovskite\" derives from silicate perovskite, the stable phase of MgSiO throughout most of Earth's mantle, which has the perovskite structure. The prefix \"post-\" refers to the fact that it occurs after perovskite structured MgSiO as pressure increases (and historically, the progression of high pressure mineral physics). At upper mantle pressures, nearest Earth's surface, MgSiO persists as the silicate mineral enstatite, a pyroxene rock forming mineral found in igneous and metamorphic rocks of the crust.\n\nThe CaIrO-type phase of MgSiO phase was discovered in 2004 using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC) technique by a group at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and, independently, by researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology who used a combination of quantum-mechanical simulations and LHDAC experiments. The TIT group's paper appeared in the journal \"Science\". The ETH/JAM-EST collaborative paper and TIT group's second paper appeared two months later in the journal \"Nature\". This simultaneous discovery was preceded by S. Ono's experimental discovery of a similar phase, possessing exactly the same structure, in FeO.\n\nPost-perovskite phase is stable above 120 GPa at 2500 K, and exhibits a positive Clapeyron slope such that the transformation pressure increases with temperature. Because these conditions correspond to a depth of about 2600 km and the D\" seismic discontinuity occurs at similar depths, the perovskite to post-perovskite phase change is considered to be the origin of such seismic discontinuities in this region. Post-perovskite also holds great promise for mapping experimentally determined information regarding the temperatures and pressures of its transformation into direct information regarding temperature variations in the D\" layer once the seismic discontinuities attributed to this transformation have been sufficiently mapped out. Such information can be used, for example, to: \nFor these reasons the finding of the MgSiO-post-perovskite phase transition is considered by many geophysicists to be the most important discovery in deep Earth science in several decades, and was only made possible by the concerted efforts of mineral physics scientists around the world as they sought to increase the range and quality of LHDAC experiments and as \"ab initio\" calculations attained predictive power.\n\nThe sheet structure of post-perovskite makes the compressibility of the \"b\" axis higher than that of the \"a\" or \"c\" axis. This anisotropy may yield the morphology of a platy crystal habit parallel to the (010) plane; the seismic anisotropy observed in the D\" region might qualitatively (but not quantitatively) be explained by this characteristic. Theory predicted the (110) slip associated with particularly favorable stacking faults and confirmed by later experiments. Some theorists predicted other slip systems, which await experimental confirmation. \nIn 2005 and 2006 Ono and Oganov published two papers predicting that post-perovskite should have high electrical conductivity, perhaps two orders of magnitude higher than perovskite's conductivity. In 2008 Hirose's group published an experimental report confirming this prediction. A highly conductive post-perovskite layer provides an explanation for the observed decadal variations of the length of day.\n\nAnother potentially important effect that needs to be better characterized for the post-perovskite phase transition is the influence of other chemical components that are known to be present to some degree in Earth's lowermost mantle. The phase transition pressure (characterized by a two-phase loop in this system), was initially thought to decrease as the FeO content increases, but some recent experiments suggest the opposite. However, it is possible that the effect of FeO is more relevant as most of iron in post-perovskite is likely to be trivalent (ferric). Such components as AlO or the more oxidized FeO also affect the phase transition pressure, and might have strong mutual interactions with one another. The influence of variable chemistry present in the Earth's lowermost mantle upon the post-perovskite phase transition raises the issue of both thermal and chemical modulation of its possible appearance (along with any associated discontinuities) in the D\" layer.\n\nExperimental and theoretical work on the perovskite/post-perovskite phase transition continues, while many important features of this phase transition remain ill-constrained. For example, the Clapeyron slope (characterized by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation) describing the increase in the pressure of the phase transition with increasing temperature is known to be relatively high in comparison to other solid-solid phase transitions in the Earth's mantle, however, the experimentally determined value varies from about 5 MPa/K to as high as 13 MPa/K. \"Ab initio\" calculations give a tighter range, between 7.5 MPa/K and 9.6 MPa/K, and are probably the most reliable estimates available today. The difference between experimental estimates arises primarily because different materials were used as pressure standards in Diamond Anvil Cell experiments. A well-characterized equation of state for the pressure standard, when combined with high energy synchrotron generated X-ray diffraction patterns of the pressure standard (which is mixed in with the experimental sample material), yields information on the pressure-temperature conditions of the experiment. However, as these extreme pressures and temperatures have not been sufficiently explored in experiments, the equations of state for many popular pressure standards are not yet well characterized and often yield different results. Another source of uncertainty in LHDAC experiments is the measurement of temperature from a sample's thermal radiation, which is required to obtain the pressure from the equation of state of the pressure standard. In laser-heated experiments at such high pressures (over 1 million atmospheres), the samples are necessarily small and numerous approximations (e.g., gray body) are required to obtain estimates of the temperature.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2191103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191103", "title": "Dauer larva", "text": "Dauer larva\n\nDauer (German \"\"die Dauer\"\", English \"the enduring\", \"the duration\" in the meaning of \"a length of time\",) describes an alternative developmental stage of nematode worms, particularly rhabditids including \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", whereby the larva goes into a type of stasis and can survive harsh conditions. Since the decision to enter the dauer stage is dependent on environmental cues, it represents a classic and well studied example of polyphenism. The dauer state is given other names in the various types of nematodes such as ‘diapause’ or ‘hypobiosis’, but since the \"C. elegans\" nematode has become the most studied nematode, the term ‘dauer stage’ or 'dauer larvae' is becoming universally recognised when referring to this state in other free-living nematodes. The dauer stage is also considered to be equivalent to the infective stage of parasitic nematode larvae.\n\nAs E. Maupas first proposed in 1899-1900, all nematodes have five stages separated by four moults. Under environmental conditions that are favorable for reproduction, \"C. elegans\" larvae develop through four stages or moults which are designated as \"L1\", \"L2\", \"L3\" and \"L4\". After L4, animals moult to the reproductive adult stage. However, when the environment is unfavorable, L1 and L2 animals have the option to divert their development from reproduction to dauer formation. Signals such as temperature, food supply, and levels of a dauer-inducing pheromone, a population density cue, influence this dauer decision. Dauer larvae are thus considered an alternative L3 stage larva, and this stage is sometimes preceded by L2d. L2d animals are considered pre-dauer and are characterised by delayed development and dark intestines produced by storage of fat. L2d larvae can either continue normal development or enter dauer stage depending on whether the conditions that triggered their formation persist. Dauer is not, however, a permanent condition. In fact, if the food supply and the population density become optimal for growth the dauer larvae can exit this stage and become L4s and then adults.\nDauer larvae are extensively studied by biologists because of their ability to survive harsh environments and live for extended periods of time. For example, \"C. elegans\" dauer larvae can survive up to four months, much longer than their average lifespan of about three weeks during normal reproductive development. Two genes that are essential for dauer formation are \"daf-2\" and \"daf-23\". Dauer formation in \"C. elegans\" requires a nuclear receptor DAF-12 and a forkhead transcription factor DAF-16. In favorable environments, DAF-12 is activated by a steroid hormone, called dafachronic acid, produced by the cytochrome p450, DAF-9. DAF-9 and DAF-12 have been implicated by Cynthia Kenyon and colleagues as being required for extended longevity seen in animals that lack germlines. Kenyon showed that, although the \"daf-16\" gene is required for life extension in \"C. elegans\", the life extension effect can be uncoupled from dauer growth arrest. The lifespan increase was shown to be associated with an increase in stress resistance.\n\nA characteristic of the dauer stage is the pronounced alae which may be implicated in the entering (L1) and exiting (pre adult or L4 in \"C. elegans\") of the dauer stage.\n\nDauer larvae generally remain motionless, but can react to touch or vibrations. They can stand on their tails, waving their bodies in the air, and attach themselves to any passing animals, particularly insects, enabling them to travel to new food sources. For example, dauer larvae of rhabditids are often found in parallel rows under the elytra of dung beetles, which transport them to fresh supplies of dung.\n\n\"C\". \"elegans\" strains lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) undergo increased dauer arrest when grown without cholesterol. A study found endocannabinoids inhibit the dauer formation caused by PUFA deficiency or impaired cholesterol trafficking.\n\n\n"}

He played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Colorado Rockies, San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Angels.\n\nAfter a standout college baseball career for the Texas Longhorns, the Athletics drafted Street in the first round of the 2004 MLB draft. He won the MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 2005, and was named an All-Star in 2012 and 2014.\n\nStreet attended Westlake High School in Austin, Texas, from 1997 to 2001, where he lettered in both football and baseball, winning all-state and all-district honors in both sports. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin from 2001–2004, where he pitched for the school's baseball team. Statistically one of the best collegiate closers of all time, Street is in the top 20 for career saves (41) and fewest hits allowed per nine innings (5.46). Street received All-American honors at Texas every season he was there, and helped his team win the College World Series of collegiate baseball in 2002. In that season, he set a CWS record for the most saves and was named Most Outstanding Player. He won the USA Baseball Richard W. \"Dick\" Case Award in 2003. A year later, Street led the Longhorns to the Series semifinals, and in 2004, he helped his team to the finals, only to lose in two games to Cal State Fullerton. In 2010, Street was named to the NCAA College World Series Legends Team.\n\nDrafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round, 40th overall, of the 2004 MLB draft, Street spent a few months in the minor leagues, spending no more than a month at each level. He then was invited to the Arizona Fall League where his team took the championship.\nStreet was called up to the MLB at the start of the 2005 season. He became Oakland's closer when incumbent Octavio Dotel went down in May with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. Street saved 23 games in 27 chances to go along with a 5–1 record, 72 strikeouts, and a 1.72 ERA. Only Mariano Rivera's 1.38 ERA for the Yankees was better among American League relievers. Street had 72 strikeouts in 78 innings pitched, and opposing hitters batted only .194 against him. He was rewarded for his effort by being named Rookie of the Year, as the third player in a row who had spent some time in the Athletics organization (after Ángel Berroa in 2003, and Bobby Crosby in 2004).\n\nStreet continued to serve as the closer for the A's in 2006. He finished the season with a 4-4 record, 37 saves, 67 strikeouts, a 3.31 ERA in 70.2 innings pitched, and 11 blown saves. On October 14, Street gave up a walk-off three-run home run to Magglio Ordóñez of the Detroit Tigers in Game 4 of the 2006 ALCS that ended the A's postseason. Street had a solid season in 2007, despite missing time with an injury. He went 5–2 with a 2.88 ERA, with 16 saves and 62 strikeouts in 50 innings. Street struggled somewhat with a nagging injury in 2008. After a rough stretch in July and August, he lost his closer position to rookie Brad Ziegler. Street's health and pitching improved, although Ziegler continued to close.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Street was traded to the Colorado Rockies with outfielder Carlos González and pitcher Greg Smith for outfielder Matt Holliday.\n\nHe beat out Manny Corpas to earn the role of the Rockies' closing pitcher for the 2009 season. After poor performances by Street, Corpas was renamed the closer on April 17; however, Corpas also pitched poorly, and the closer job was given back to Street on May 1. Since that time, Street excelled in the closer role and was a key cog in the Rockies' mid-season run back into the race (16–1 from June 4 to 22). He finished 2009 with 35 saves in 37 opportunities, a 3.06 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 61.2 innings.\n\nAfter a 2009 season in which he blew only two saves, Street struggled during the playoffs for the Rockies. In Game 4 of the 2009 National League Division Series, Street entered the ninth inning with the Rockies leading 4–2. He was able to record the first two outs before allowing three runs that gave the Phillies a 5–4 win and a series victory. Before the 2010 season, Street and the Rockies agreed on a three-year $22.5 million contract with an option for 2013.\n\nStreet missed the first two-and-a-half months of the season of the 2010 season with shoulder soreness, but on returning to the team he assumed the role of closer. Prior to a game on July 26, 2010, Street was struck in the midsection by a line drive during batting practice. He fainted several times from the pain and needed to be taken off the field in an ambulance, but he avoided the disabled list. Street finished 2010 with 20 saves in 25 opportunities and a 3.61 ERA.\n\nStreet opened 2011 as the Rockies closer, saving 29 games in 32 opportunities through early August. He suffered a right triceps strain and was sent to the 15-day disabled list on August 12. When he returned, he worked in the role of set-up man while Rafael Betancourt remained as closer. Street finished 2011 with a 3.86 ERA and 55 strike-outs versus 9 walks in 58.1 innings.\n\nStreet was traded by the Rockies to the San Diego Padres for left hander Nick Schmidt on December 7, 2011. The Padres picked up all but $500,000 of Street's remaining contract, and he moved immediately into the closer role vacated by Heath Bell. Street missed a month with a right shoulder strain, but otherwise had an excellent first half with the Padres. He compiled a 1.13 ERA, was 13 for 13 in converting save opportunities, and did not allow a home run in his 25 games, earning a selection to his first All-Star Game. On July 29, 2012, the Padres and Street agreed to terms on a two-year contract extension with a club option for the 2015 season.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Street suffered a strained left calf while fielding the final out of the game and missed the next six weeks. At the time of the injury, he had not allowed a run since June 17. He returned to pitch in three more games at the end of the season, earning his 200th career save in his first game back. His only blown save, loss, and home runs given up for the season (two) all occurred in his final appearance of the year against the San Francisco Giants. Street finished the 2012 season with 23 saves in 24 chances and a 1.85 ERA in 39 innings pitched, striking out 47 against 11 walks.\n\nStreet had difficulties in the first half of the 2013 season, giving up 10 home runs in 26 innings through June 23. But he followed that with a streak of 20 scoreless innings from June 26 through September 3, earning the National League Player of the Week honor for the week ending September 8. Street appeared in 58 games in 2013, missing only a couple weeks in early June with a calf strain. He converted 33 of 35 save opportunities and posted a 2.70 ERA, striking out 46 and walking 14 in 56 innings.\n\nOn July 19, 2014, Street was traded to the Los Angeles Angels with Trevor Gott in exchange for Taylor Lindsey, José Rondón, R. J. Alvarez, and Elliot Morris. After joining the Angels, Street recorded 10 saves in a row without allowing any runs, providing a huge upgrade for the struggling Angels bullpen.\n\nIn May 2015, Street signed a two-year contract extension with the Angels worth $18 million.\n\nOn July 22, 2015, Street recorded his 300th career save in a victory over the Minnesota Twins, becoming the 27th pitcher all time to reach the 300 saves milestone.\n\nAfter struggling for most of the 2016 season, Street was ruled out for the remainder of the year after undergoing right knee surgery on August 24.\n\nStreet was activated from the disabled list on June 22, 2017 to play for the first time since 2016. He made his season debut on June 23, pitching a scoreless inning with one strikeout. He went back on the disabled list and was ruled out for the season, only pitching in 4 games.\n\nOn March 29, 2018, Street announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on Twitter after battling injuries for the previous two seasons.\n\nAs opposed to many other closers who are power pitchers, Street was a finesse pitcher. Street's fastball usually hovered in the 88-92 mph range, but it had exceptional tailing movement. He also featured a sharp slider at 84–86 mph that he used frequently against righties, as well as a good circle changeup at around the 82–84 mph range with splitter-like movement that he used effectively against lefties.\n\nStreet's father was former University of Texas quarterback James Street, and his brother Juston Street was previously a pitcher for the minor league Vancouver Canadians. Street and his wife, Lacey, have three sons named Ripken Rae Street, Ryder James Street, and Rafe William Street.\n"}

Over a career that spanned nearly six decades, DeCarava came to be known as a founder in the field of black and white fine art photography, advocating for an approach to the medium based on the core value of an individual, subjective creative sensibility, which was separate and distinct from the \"social documentary\" style of many predecessors.\n\nRoy DeCarava was born in Harlem, New York on December 9, 1919. DeCarava came of age during the Harlem Renaissance, when artistic activity and achievement among African Americans flourished across the literary, musical, dramatic, and visual arts. After graduating from Textile High School in New York City in 1938, DeCarava independently began working as a visual artist. He continued his formal education at Cooper Union (1938–1940), where he studied painting, architecture, and sculpture. DeCarava expanded upon this early training at the Harlem Art Center (1940–1942) as well as the George Washington Carver Art School, where in addition to painting he began to experiment with printmaking. DeCarava first began to use photography as a means to record and as reference for his paintings, but was so enthralled by the medium that he began devoting all of his time to it and championed black and white silver gelatin photography as an art form of its own. He used his camera to produce striking studies of everyday black life in Harlem, capturing the varied textures of the neighborhood and the creative efflorescence of the Harlem Renaissance. Resisting explicit politicization, DeCarava used photography to counter what he described as “black people...not being portrayed in a serious and artistic way.”\n\nDeCavara was drafted in the Army in 1942, where he would first be sent to Virginia, and then stationed in Fort Claiborne, Louisiana, in the Jim Crow South. There, DeCarava experienced a racism so intense that he broke down. In Peter Galassi's biographical essay for the MoMA show, the artist recalled: \"The only place that wasn’t segregated in the army was the psychiatric ward of the hospital. I was there for about a month. I was in the army for about six or seven months altogether, but I had nightmares about it for twenty years.\" \n\nDeCarava produced five published art books, including \"The Sound I Saw\" and \"The Sweet Flypaper of Life\", as well as landmark museum catalogs and retrospective surveys from the Friends of Photography and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The subject of at least 15 solo art exhibitions, DeCarava was the first African-American photographer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship and as a result of the fellowship, was able to photograph his community and New York City for one year; expressing early creative impressions through the black and white silver gelatin process. His first photo exhibit was in 1950, at the Forty-Fourth Street Gallery in New York City, and he soon found a mentor in Edward Steichen, director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art. Gradually, DeCarava became known for his dedication to the field of visual art and for his own work within it, including many distinctive black and white, silver gelatin photographs of great American musicians. His work also appeared on several record album covers, such as \"Porgy and Bess,\" by Miles Davis, \"Bless this House,\" by Mahalia Jackson, \"Flamenco Fire\" by Carlos Montoya, and \"Big Bill's Blues\", by Big Bill Broonzy. DeCarava received honorary degrees from Rhode Island School of Design, the Maryland Institute of Art, Wesleyan University, The New School for Social Research, The Parsons School of Design and the Art Institute of Boston for contributions to American art.\n\nIn 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest award given to artists by the United States Government.\n\nDeCarava encouraged other fine art photographers and believed in the accessibility of the medium. From 1955 to 1957, at his own expense, he established and supported A Photographer's Gallery in his apartment in a brownstone block at 48 West 85th Street, New York, in which was shown artwork by the great names of American photography of the period. In 1963, he co-founded and became the first director of the Kamoinge Workshop, a Harlem-Based collective that supported the work of black photographers through exhibitions, public programs, group critiques, and published portfolios.\n\nIn 1972 DeCarava received the Benin Creative Photography Award for his contributions to the black community as a creative photographer.\n\nDeCarava died in New York City, on October 27, 2009.\n\nComing of age in the 1940s, DeCarava appears nothing short of iconoclastic in both his approach to photography, a medium strenuously identified with evidentiary truth, and in his aesthetic ambitions to, as he said, “break through a kind of literalness,” and “express some things I felt.” Maintaining his quest to create a visually autonomous photographic subject of color, DeCarava endured decades of embittering misunderstanding. He has pointed out over and over that despite his “reputation as a documentar[y] photographer, … I really never was,” and reiterated his steadfastly modernist concern to achieve “a creative expression,” rather than a “documentary or sociological statement.” While DeCarava never worked in the field of cinema himself, he grew up in the era of black-and-white filmmaking and, in an interview much later in his career, noted, “I think I absorbed the visual aesthetic of black-and-white films, so that when I started taking pictures, it was natural.” \n\nHis largest work is \"Roy DeCarava: A Retrospective\", over 200 black and white photos spanning the late 1940s to the 1990s. Another work is \"The Sweet Flypaper of Life\". Published in 1955, it is a pictorial narrative of family life in Harlem with photographs by DeCarava and text by Langston Hughes. DeCarava wrote ”in spite of poverty, you see people with dignity and a certain quality that contrasts with where they live and what they’re doing.” His Guggenheim fellowship helped fund the project while he spent a full year shooting the photographs for the book.\n\n\nDeCarava's work is held in the following permanent public collections:\n\n\n"}

Within the larger long bar stretching across the center of the galaxy appears to be a smaller bar that comprises the core, with an apparent size of about 50″ × 40″. This second bar is more prominent in infrared images of the central region of the galaxy, and likely arises from a combination of dynamical instabilities of stellar orbits in the region, along with gravity, density waves, and the overall rotation of the disc. The inner bar structure likely rotates as a whole more rapidly than the larger long bar, creating the diagonal shape seen in images. \n\nThe spiral arms extend in a wide curve north and south from the ends of the east-west bar and form an almost ring like Z-shaped halo. Astronomers think NGC 1365's prominent bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, drawing gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the central black hole.\n\nNGC 1365, including its two outer spiral arms, spreads over around 200,000 light-years. Different parts of the galaxy take different times to make a full rotation around the core of the galaxy, with the outer parts of the bar completing one circuit in about 350 million years. NGC 1365 and other galaxies of its type have come to more prominence in recent years with new observations indicating that the Milky Way could also be a barred spiral galaxy. Such galaxies are quite common — two thirds of spiral galaxies are barred according to recent estimates, and studying others can help astronomers understand our own galactic home.\n\nSupernovae 2012fr, 2001du, 1983V, and 1957C were observed in NGC 1365.\n\nThe central supermassive black hole in the active nucleus, which has a mass of about 2 million solar masses, rotates at close to the speed of light. These observations, announced in February 2013, were made using the X-ray telescope satellite NuSTAR. \n\n\n"}

It is owned by Stephens Media Group and airs a Top 40 (CHR) radio format. KZBD carries \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show\" in AM drive time, syndicated by Premiere Networks. \n\nKZBD has an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts, the maximum output for non-grandfathered FM stations. It is heard in parts of Washington, Idaho and Montana. The transmitter is in Spokane, off South Krell Ridge Lane, on Krell Hill, also known as \"Tower Mountain.\" Programming is also heard on translator station K265AV at 100.9 MHz in Bonners Ferry, Idaho. The studios and offices are on East 57th Avenue.\n\nKZBD is one of seven local Spokane FM radio stations heard across Canada by subscribers of the Shaw Direct satellite TV service.\n\nIn July 1965, the father-son team of Loren (father) and Terry W. (son) Denbrook, doing business as Denbrook Enterprises, was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit to build an FM station in Spokane on 105.7 MHz using the call sign KTWD. KTWD signed on the air on February 23, 1966. \n\nThe station's transmitter and studio were located on 610 West Garland Avenue in Spokane and the station played popular music. KTWD was Spokane's first FM-only commercial station, not co-owned with an AM station. It was also Spokane's first FM stereo station. Terry Denbrook served as the station's chief engineer and station manager. The call letters were Terry W. Denbrook's initials.\n\nIn 1970, Denbrook Enterprises sold the station to Bellevue Broadcasters, which changed the format to easy listening and the call letters to KEZE-FM. The station used the identification \"KEZE, E-Z listening.\" It was paired with AM 1380 which became KEZE, simulcasting the FM station's beautiful music sound. (1380 is now off the air.)\n\nIn 1979, Great American Broadcasting acquired KEZE (AM), switching it to KCKO, airing a middle of the road format. KEZE-FM was acquired by Kaye-Smith Enterprises. Kaye-Smith already owned Top 40 AM 790 KJRB, so the FM station flipped to a format that would also bring in young listeners, album-oriented rock. KEZE called itself \"Rock 106 - Spokane's Best Rock.\" In 1989, KJRB and KEZE were acquired by Apollo Broadcasting. Under Apollo, KEZE leaned more toward active rock, with plenty of harder-edged rock acts on its playlist.\n\nOn October 20, 1995, the station flipped to Adult Album Alternative (AAA) as KAEP \"105.7 The Peak.\" The former album rock format and KEZE call letters returned to the FM dial at 96.9 on March 4, 1996. \n\nIn 2003, 105.7 shifted to active rock, becoming \"105.7 The Buzzard\" KZBD. In 2008, the station switched back to \"105.7 The Peak\", but with an alternative rock format instead of AAA. It was also the Spokane home of two syndicated shows, \"The Bob & Tom Show\" in AM drive time and \"Loveline\" at night.\n\nOn May 19, 2010, KZBD flipped to a Top 40/CHR format, branded as \"Now 105.7 FM.\" This marked the first time since 2005 that Spokane had a full-powered Top 40/CHR format since 92.9 KZZU flipped to Adult Top 40. The station added Elvis Duran's syndicated morning show to its lineup on May 24, 2010. Middays featured \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\", which was added the day of the switch. DJ Kowax hosted afternoons and B-Mega was heard in nights, both local and live. \n\nWhen 96.1 KIXZ flipped to Top 40/CHR in March 2012, it picked up the Elvis Duran and Ryan Seacrest's shows. Both programs were owned by Clear Channel Communications, which also owned KIXZ. (Clear Channel has since become iHeartMedia, Inc.) On May 8, 2014, KZBD once again became Spokane's only Top 40/CHR when KIXZ returned to country music and has since switched to alternative KFOO-FM. Elvis Duran returned to KZBD mornings when it no longer was airing on 96.1.\n\nIn October 2019, the station was sold to Stephens Media Group after it acquired most of the properties of former owner Mapleton Communications.\n"}

Fort Niagara guards the mouth of the Niagara where it flows into Lake Ontario.\n\nFort Schlosser was occupied by American troops at the start of the War of 1812, but was captured in 1813 and burned. The fort was located in present-day Niagara Falls, New York in what is now Niagara County, New York, near the current water intakes for the New York Power Authority off of the Robert Moses Parkway. Today, all that remains is the Old Stone Chimney, which was moved to near the intersection of Buffalo Avenue and the Robert Moses Parkway traffic circle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2191130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191130", "title": "Forward secrecy", "text": "Forward secrecy\n\nIn cryptography, forward secrecy (FS), also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a feature of specific key agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if the private key of the server is compromised. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future compromises of secret keys or passwords. By generating a unique session key for every session a user initiates, the compromise of a single session key will not affect any data other than that exchanged in the specific session protected by that particular key. \n\nForward secrecy further protects data on the transport layer of a network that uses common SSL/TLS protocols, including OpenSSL, which had previously been affected by the Heartbleed security bug. If forward secrecy is used, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future, even if the adversary actively interfered, for example via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nThe value of forward secrecy depends on the assumed capabilities of an adversary. Forward secrecy has value if an adversary is assumed to be able to obtain secret keys from a device (READ access) but not modify the way keys are generated in a device (WRITE access). In some cases an adversary who can read keys from a device may also be able to modify the functioning of the session key generator. In these cases forward secrecy has no value.\n\nThe term \"perfect forward secrecy\" was coined by C. G. Günther in 1990 and further discussed by Whitfield Diffie, Paul van Oorschot, and Michael James Wiener in 1992 where it was used to describe a property of the Station-to-Station protocol.\n\nForward secrecy has also been used to describe the analogous property of password-authenticated key agreement protocols where the long-term secret is a (shared) password.\n\nIn 2000 the IEEE first ratified IEEE 1363, which establishes the related one-party and two-party forward secrecy properties of various standard key agreement schemes.\n\nAn encryption system has the property of forward secrecy if plain-text (decrypted) inspection of the data exchange that occurs during key agreement phase of session initiation does not reveal the key that was used to encrypt the remainder of the session. \n\nThe following is a hypothetical example of a simple instant messaging protocol that employs forward secrecy:\n\nForward secrecy (achieved by generating new session keys for each message) ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if one of the keys generated in an iteration of step 2 is compromised, since such a key is only used to encrypt a single message. Forward secrecy also ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if the long-term private keys from step 1 are compromised. However, masquerading as Alice or Bob would be possible going forward if this occurred, possibly compromising all future messages.\n\nForward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a long-term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past conversations. However, forward secrecy cannot defend against a successful cryptanalysis of the underlying ciphers being used, since a cryptanalysis consists of finding a way to decrypt an encrypted message without the key, and forward secrecy only protects keys, not the ciphers themselves. A patient attacker can capture a conversation whose confidentiality is protected through the use of public-key cryptography and wait until the underlying cipher is broken (e.g. large quantum computers could be created which allow the discrete logarithm problem to be computed quickly). This would allow the recovery of old plaintexts even in a system employing forward secrecy.\n\nWeak perfect forward secrecy (wPFS) is the weaker property whereby when agents' long-term keys are compromised, the secrecy of previously established session-keys is guaranteed, but only for sessions in which the adversary did not actively interfere. This new notion, and the distinction between this and forward secrecy was introduced by Hugo Krawczyk in 2005.\nThis weaker definition implicitly requires that full (perfect) forward secrecy maintains the secrecy of previously established session keys even in sessions where the adversary \"did\" actively interfere, or attempted to act as a man in the middle.\n\nForward secrecy is present in several major protocol implementations, such as SSH and as an optional feature in IPsec (RFC 2412). Off-the-Record Messaging, a cryptography protocol and library for many instant messaging clients, provides forward secrecy as well as deniable encryption.\n\nIn Transport Layer Security (TLS), cipher suites based on Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DHE-RSA, DHE-DSA) and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman key exchange (ECDHE-RSA, ECDHE-ECDSA) are available. In theory, TLS can choose appropriate ciphers since SSLv3, but in everyday practice many implementations have refused to offer forward secrecy or only provide it with very low encryption grade. TLS 1.3 leaves ephemeral Diffie–Hellman as the only key exchange mechanism to provide forward secrecy.\n\nOpenSSL supports forward secrecy using elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman since version 1.0, with a computational overhead of approximately 15% for the initial handshake.\n\nThe Signal Protocol uses the Double Ratchet Algorithm to provide forward secrecy.\n\nOn the other hand, among popular protocols currently in use, WPA does not support forward secrecy.\n\nForward secrecy is seen as an important security feature by several large Internet information providers. Since late 2011, Google provided forward secrecy with TLS by default to users of its Gmail service, Google Docs service, and encrypted search services. Since November 2013, Twitter provided forward secrecy with TLS to its users. Wikis hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation have all provided forward secrecy to users since July 2014 and are requiring the use of forward secrecy since August 2018. \n\nFacebook reported as part of an investigation into email encryption that, as of May 2014, 74% of hosts that support STARTTLS also provide forward secrecy. TLS 1.3, published in August 2018, dropped support for ciphers without forward secrecy. , 96.6% of web servers surveyed support some form of forward secrecy, and 52.1% will use forward secrecy with most browsers.\n\nAt WWDC 2016, Apple announced that all iOS apps would need to use App Transport Security (ATS), a feature which enforces the use of HTTPS transmission. Specifically, ATS requires the use of an encryption cipher that provides forward secrecy. ATS became mandatory for apps on January 1, 2017.\n\nThe Signal messaging application employs forward secrecy in its protocol, notably differentiating it from messaging protocols based on PGP.\n\nGerman security-focused email provider Mailbox.org uses PFS and HSTS for messages in transit.\n\n\n"}

In the 1820s, Black Rock was the rival of Buffalo for the terminus of the Erie Canal, but Buffalo, with its larger harbor capacity and greater distance from the shores of Canada, a recent antagonist during the War of 1812, won the competition. Black Rock took its name from a large outcropping of black limestone along the Niagara River, which was blasted away in the early 1820s to make way for the canal.\n\nIn spite of losing the Erie Canal terminus to Buffalo and twice being burned to the ground by the British during the War of 1812, Black Rock continued to prosper. In 1814, a small group of American riflemen defended Black Rock and neighboring Buffalo from a British assault and, in 1839, it was incorporated as a town. In 1853, the City of Buffalo annexed the town of Black Rock.\n\nBecause of its strategic position across the Niagara River from Canada, Black Rock was an important crossing place for African-Americans escaping slavery via the Underground Railroad. This heritage is celebrated with an annual Underground Railroad Re-Enactment at Broderick Park on Unity Island at Niagara and West Ferry Streets, the site of a ferry crossing prior to the construction of passenger bridges.\n\nThe area's first industry was shipbuilding, later supplanted by foundries, manufacturing, and canal commerce. Today Black Rock boasts some pre-annexation houses and many excellent, often vacant examples of early 20th century brick and masonry industrial architecture.\n\nBlack Rock's history is amply documented in the library collections of the Buffalo History Museum.\n\nThe Market Square Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\n\nIn the 1870s, the International Railway Bridge connected the two nations at Black Rock, an engineering marvel at the time. The Black Rock Rail Yard handled both passenger service and commercial transport of goods into and out of Canada. Following the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the construction of the United States's Interstate Highway system, Canada's Queen Elizabeth Highway, and the increase of commercial air travel, the Black Rock Rail Yard lost its passenger service and later most of its commercial freight service. The railroad bridge, however, remains in heavy usage and is one of the most important rail crossings between the United States and Canada.\n\nBlack Rock's best-known resident was American poet Robert Creeley, who lived with his family in a converted firehouse at the corner of Amherst and East Streets from 1990 to 2003. Another prominent resident was US Secretary of War Peter Buell Porter. Current residents include prominent Buffalo architect Max Willig who lives in the historic Amherst National Bank Building at the corner of Amherst and Germain Streets.\n\nFormer US Congressman John M.

{"id": "2191164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191164", "title": "Matthew 5:17", "text": "Matthew 5:17\n\nMatthew 5:17 is the 17th verse of the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament and is part of the Sermon on the Mount. One of the most debated verses in the gospel, this verse begins a new section on Jesus and the Torah, where Jesus discusses the Law and the Prophets.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleGateway Matthew 5:17\n\nThis verse is central to the debate over the relationship between the New Testament and the Old Testament first begun by Marcion of Sinope. There are several parts of the New Testament where Jesus can be read as rejecting some tenets of Mosaic law. Issues include the traditional understanding of the Sabbath in , divorce laws in , and dietary prohibitions in .\n\nThe antinomian viewpoint holds that, because Jesus accomplished all that was required by the law, thus fulfilling it, he made it unnecessary for anyone to do anything further. Proponents of this view believe this view was described by the Apostles in Acts of the Apostles, and that the Jewish Christians overlooked such teaching as they continued to worship in Herod's Temple as prescribed by the Mosaic Law, even after the resurrection. According to this view, anyone accepting his gift of salvation would not only avoid consequences of failing to live up to the law, but is no longer expected to do any works of the law for any spiritual reason (See also Hyperdispensationalism).\n\nThe opposite of antinomianism, is that the entire Torah Law is still entirely applicable to Christians; not for salvation, but rather for simple obedience. This interpretation stems primarily from the New Testament affirmation that Jesus Christ was sinless in every way (), sin is defined by the Torah (), and that Jesus' followers, both Jew and Gentile, are admonished to imitate Him in every way (). This view affirms the six points of St. Augustine listed above, but differs from other traditional views by affirming obedience to specific commands of the Law such as dietary laws; laws to which other views teach obedience is no longer intended by God. Proponents of this view see and as evidence that Jesus did not negate any aspects of the Biblical Torah Law for his followers. Furthermore, they see it as a contradiction of Jesus' sinlessness (according to His own words, ) for Him to have taught disobedience to any Torah command, no matter how small. For references for this view, see Christian views on the old covenant.\n\nThis issue was a central one to the Jewish Christians, that the author of Matthew is widely believed to have been a part of, as the Jewish Christians would have accused the Pauline Christians of abandoning Jewish doctrine, for example the Council of Jerusalem and Acts of the Apostles :\nSome scholars also believe that antinomianism, the belief that all was allowed because there were no laws, was believed by a faction in the early Christian community. In this verse the Gospel of Matthew directly counters these views by insisting the \"old laws\" such as the Ten Commandments are still valid. France notes that \"law and prophets\" was a common expression for the entirety of what Christians today call the Old Testament, though it more correctly refers to the Mosaic Law and Neviim, see Biblical Canon.\n\nThe main controversy over this verse is over the word \"fulfill.\" What exactly does fulfilling the laws entail? A wide number of reading of the word \"plerosai\", fulfil, have been advanced. Among them are: establish, confirm, validate, complete, bring into actuality by doing, set forth in their true meaning, accomplish, and obey. These varying definitions and the textual uncertainty over the status of the law have led to a number of understandings of the relationship between Mosaic law and the New Testament. \n\nIn the early church there were a number of factions that felt the coming of Jesus had brought about a rejection of the Old Testament, these included the followers of Simon Magus, Marcionism, Gnosticism, Montanism, Manichaeism, and others. The Ante-Nicene Fathers in the early church rejected these views and spent considerable time rebutting them. For example, Irenaeus rejected Marcion and praised the Apostles in his \"Against Heresies\" 3.12.12:\n\nAnother important writer who rejected any break between Jesus and Moses was St. Augustine who outlines his view in his \"Reply to Faustus\", a Manichaeist. Augustine outlined six different ways in which Jesus fulfilled the law:\n\nThe most important of these arguments was the sixth, that Jesus expanded the law but did not replace it. A number of others used analogy to explain this notion. Chrysostom used the analogy of a race saying that Jesus had added extra distance for the Christians to run, but the beginning remained the same. Theophylact of Bulgaria used the image of an artist colouring in an outline, and St. Thomas Aquinas saw it as how a tree still contains the seed. This view became the accepted Roman Catholic position, but was challenged in the Protestant reformation. Leading Protestants such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli rejected the idea Jesus had added to the Law. Rather they argued that Jesus only illustrated the true Law that had always existed, but had been badly understood by the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders. The Anabaptists took the opposite view and felt the Jesus had greatly reformed the Law and felt that Old Testament precepts could only be justified if they had been reaffirmed by Jesus.\n\nE. P. Sanders in \"Jesus and Judaism\", published in 1985, argued that Jesus was a Pharisee, as he could find no substantial points of opposition. Jesus himself did not transgress any part of the Mosaic law, did not oppose or reject the law, and that the disciples continued to keep it, as is shown by their continued worship in Herod's Temple (e.g. ; ). Sanders also argued that Jesus' sayings did not entirely determine early Christian behaviour and attitude, as is shown by Paul's discussion of divorce (), where he quotes Jesus' sayings (\"not I but the Lord\") and then gives his own independent (\"I and not the Lord\") rules. (See also Great Apostasy, Cafeteria Christianity).\n\n"}

{"id": "2191184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191184", "title": "Hepatozoon", "text": "Hepatozoon\n\nHepatozoon is a genus of Apicomplexa alveolates which incorporates over 300 species obligate intraerythrocytic parasites. Species have been described from all groups of tetrapod vertebrates, as well as a wide range of haematophagous arthropods, which serve as both the vectors and definitive hosts of the parasite. By far the most biodiverse and prevalent of all haemogregarines, the genus is distinguished by its unique reciprocal trophic lifecycle which lacks the salivary transmission between hosts commonly associated with other apicomplexans. While particularly prevalent in amphibians and reptiles, the genus is more well known in veterinary circles for causing a tick-borne disease called hepatozoonosis in some mammals.\n\nMembers of the genus \"Hepatozoon\" possess particularly complex lifecycles which vary considerably among species. Sexual reproduction and sporogenic development occur within the haemocoel of the invertebrate host, which is subsequently consumed by the vertebrate host. The sporozoites then migrate to the liver of the vertebrate, where they undergo multiple fission (asexual reproduction) to produce merozoites. The meronts are released into the bloodstream where they form gametocytes, the final stage of development within the vertebrate host. The gamonts are large, conspicuous organisms which occupy a significant portion of the erythrocyte, and are easily visible on simple blood films. When the invertebrate vector feeds on the blood of the infected vertebrate, the gamonts are taken up into the gut once more, where they undergo gametogenesis and the cycle begins once more.\n\nThis simplified lifecycle is, of course, insufficient for species which infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts which do not directly feed on one another, necessitating an even more complex cycle. For instance, \"Hepatozoon sipedon\" infects mosquitoes and snakes, but since snakes do not typically feed on mosquitoes, a third, intermediate host is required, in this case a frog. The frog ingests the infected mosquito, and the snake acquires the infection by feeding on the now-infected frog. Another mosquito can then feed on the snake, thus continuing the lifecycle.\n\nHepatozoonosis, therefore, results when an animal eats an infected tick - the disease is not spread by tick bites. Species include \"Hepatozoon muris\" and \"Hepatozoon canis\", which typically infects mice and dogs, respectively, and \"Hepatozoon atticorae\", which is found in birds.\n"}
{"id": "2191185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191185", "title": "Neutron cross section", "text": "Neutron cross section\n\nIn nuclear and particle physics, the concept of a neutron cross section is used to express the likelihood of interaction between an incident neutron and a target nucleus. In conjunction with the neutron flux, it enables the calculation of the reaction rate, for example to derive the thermal power of a nuclear power plant. The standard unit for measuring the cross section is the barn, which is equal to 10 m or 10 cm. The larger the neutron cross section, the more likely a neutron will react with the nucleus.\n\nAn isotope (or nuclide) can be classified according to its neutron cross section and how it reacts to an incident neutron. Nuclides that tend to absorb a neutron and either decay or keep the neutron in its nucleus are neutron absorbers and will have a \"capture cross section\" for that reaction. Isotopes that fission, are fissionable fuels and have a corresponding \"fission cross section\". The remaining isotopes will simply scatter the neutron, and have a \"scatter cross section\". Some isotopes, like uranium-238, have nonzero cross sections of all three.\n\nIsotopes which have a large scatter cross section and a low mass are good neutron moderators (see chart below). Nuclides which have a large absorption cross section are neutron poisons if they are neither fissile nor undergo decay. A poison that is purposely inserted into a nuclear reactor for controlling its reactivity in the long term and improve its shutdown margin is called a \"burnable\" poison.\n\nThe neutron cross section, and therefore the probability of an interaction, depends on:\nand, to a lesser extent, of:\n\nThe neutron cross section is defined for a given type of target particle. For example, the capture cross section of hydrogen-2 (referred to as deuterium) is much smaller than that of common hydrogen-1. This is the reason why some reactors use heavy water (in which most of the hydrogen is deuterium) instead of ordinary light water as moderator: fewer neutrons are lost by capture inside the medium, hence enabling the use of natural uranium instead of enriched uranium. This is the principle of a CANDU reactor.\n\nThe likelihood of interaction between an incident neutron and a target nuclide, independent of the type of reaction, is expressed with the help of the total cross section \"σ\". However, it may be useful to know if the incoming particle bounces off the target (and therefore continue travelling after the interaction) or disappears after the reaction. For that reason, the scattering and absorption cross sections \"σ\" and \"σ\" are defined and the total cross section is simply the sum of the two partial cross sections:\n\nIf the neutron is absorbed when approaching the nuclide, the atomic nucleus moves up on the table of isotopes by one position. For instance, U-235 becomes U-236* with the * indicating the nucleus is highly energized. This energy has to be released and the release can take place through any of several mechanisms.\n\n\n\nThe scattering cross-section can be further subdivided into coherent scattering and incoherent scattering, which is caused by the spin dependence of the scattering cross-section and, for a natural sample, presence of different isotopes of the same element in the sample.\n\nBecause neutrons interact with the nuclear potential, the scattering cross-section varies for different isotopes of the element in question. A very prominent example is hydrogen and its isotope deuterium. The total cross-section for hydrogen is over 10 times that of deuterium, mostly due to the large incoherent scattering length of hydrogen. Some metals are rather transparent to neutrons, aluminum and zirconium being the two best examples of this.\n\nFor a given target and reaction, the cross section is strongly dependent on the neutron speed. In the extreme case, the cross section can be, at low energies, either zero (the energy for which the cross section becomes significant is called threshold energy) or much larger than at high energies.\n\nTherefore, a cross section should be defined either at a given energy or should be averaged in an energy range (or group). See here for more details.\n\nAs an example, the plot on the right shows that the fission cross section of the uranium 235 is low at high neutron energies but becomes higher at low energies. Such physical constraint explains why most operational nuclear reactors use a neutron moderator to reduce the energy of the neutron and thus increase the probability of fission, essential to produce energy and sustain the chain reaction.\n\nA simple estimation of energy dependence of any kind of cross section is provided by the Ramsauer Model, which is based on idea that the \"effective\" size of a neutron is proportional to the breadth of the probability density function of where the neutron is likely to be, which itself is proportional to the neutron's thermal de Broglie wavelength.\n\nTaking formula_3 as effective radius of the neutron, we can estimate area of circle formula_4 in which neutron hit nuclei of effective radius formula_5 as\n\nWhile the assumptions of this model are naive, it explains at least qualitatively typical measured energy dependence of neutron absorption cross section. For neutron of wavelength much larger than typical radius of atomic nuclei (1–10 fm, E = 10–1000 keV) the formula_7 can be neglected. For these low energy neutrons (such as thermal neutrons) cross section formula_8 is inversely proportional to neutron velocity.\n\nThis explains the advantage of using neutron moderator in fission nuclear reactor. On the other hand, for very high energy neutrons (over 1 MeV), formula_9 can be neglected, and neutron cross section is approximately constant, determined just by cross section of atomic nuclei.\n\nHowever, this simple model does not take into account so called neutron resonances, which strongly modify neutron cross section in energy range of 1 eV–10 keV, nor threshold energy of some nuclear reactions.\n\nCross sections are usually measured at 20 °C. To account for the dependence with temperature of the medium (viz. the target), the following formula is used:\n\nwhere \"σ\" is the cross section at temperature \"T\", and \"σ\" the cross section at temperature \"T\" (\"T\" and \"T\" in kelvins).\n\nThe energy is defined at the most likely energy and velocity of the neutron. The neutron population consists of a Maxwellian distribution, and hence the mean energy and velocity will be higher. Consequently also a Maxveliian correction-term (sqrt(Pi)/2) has to be included when calculating the cross-section Equation 38. \n\nA Doppler broadening of neutron resonances is very important phenomenon, which improves nuclear reactor stability. The prompt temperature coefficient of most thermal reactors is negative, owing to a nuclear Doppler effect. Nuclei are located in atoms which are themselves in continual motion owing to their thermal energy (temperature). As a result of these thermal motions, neutrons impinging on a target appears to the nuclei in the target to have a continuous spread in energy. This, in turn, has an effect on the observed shape of resonance. The resonance becomes shorter and wider than when the nuclei are at rest.\n\nAlthough the shape of resonances changes with temperature, the total area under the resonance remains essentially constant. But this does not imply constant neutron absorption. Despite the constant area under resonance a resonance integral, which determines the absorption, increases with increasing target temperature. This, of course, decreases coefficient k (negative reactivity is inserted).\n\nImagine a spherical target (outlined in grey in the figure) and a beam of particles (in blue) \"flying\" at speed \"v\" (vector in blue) in the direction of the target. We want to know how many particles impact it during time interval \"dt\". To achieve it, the particles have to be in the green cylinder in the figure (volume \"V\"). The base of the cylinder is the geometrical cross section of the target perpendicular to the beam (surface \"σ\" in red) and its height the length travelled by the particles during \"dt\" (length \"v dt\"):\n\nNoting \"n\" the number of particles per unit volume, there are \"n V\" particles in the volume \"V\", which will, per definition of \"V\", undergo a reaction. Noting \"r\" the reaction rate onto one target, it gives:\n\nIt follows directly from the definition of the neutron flux formula_13 = \"n v\":\n\nAssuming that there is not one but \"N\" targets per unit volume, the reaction rate \"R\" per unit volume is:\n\nKnowing that the typical nuclear radius \"r\" is of the order of 10 cm, the expected nuclear cross section is of the order of \"π r\" or roughly 10 cm (thus justifying the definition of the barn). However, if measured experimentally ( \"σ\" = \"R\" / (\"Φ N\") ), the experimental cross sections vary enormously. As an example, for slow neutrons absorbed by the (n, γ) reaction the cross section in some cases (xenon-135) is as much as 2,650,000 barns, while the cross sections for transmutations by gamma-ray absorption are in the neighborhood of 0.001 barn (See here for more example of cross sections).\n\nThe \"nuclear cross section\" is consequently a purely conceptual quantity representing how big the nucleus should be to be consistent with this simple mechanical model.\n\nCross sections depend strongly on the incoming particle speed. In the case of a beam with multiple particle speeds, the reaction rate \"R\" is integrated over the whole range of energy:\n\nWhere \"σ(E)\" is the continuous cross section, \"Φ(E)\" the differential flux and \"N\" the target atom density.\n\nIn order to obtain a formulation equivalent to the mono energetic case, an average cross section is defined:\n\nWhere \"Φ\"= formula_18 \"Φ(E) dE\" is the integral flux.\n\nUsing the definition of the integral flux \"Φ\" and the average cross section \"σ\", the same formulation as before is found:\n\nUp to now, the cross section referred to in this article corresponds to the microscopic cross section \"σ\". However, it is possible to define the macroscopic cross section \"Σ\" which corresponds to the total \"equivalent area\" of all target particles per unit volume:\n\nwhere \"N\" is the atomic density of the target.\n\nTherefore, since the cross section can be expressed in cm and the density in cm, the macroscopic cross section is usually expressed in cm. Using the equation derived in #Link to reaction rate and interpretation, the reaction rate \"R\" can be derived using only the neutron flux \"Φ\" and the macroscopic cross section \"Σ\":\n\nThe mean free path \"λ\" of a random particle is the average length between two interactions. The total length \"L\" that non perturbed particles travel during a time interval \"dt\" in a volume \"dV\" is simply the product of the length \"l\" covered by each particle during this time with the number of particles \"N\" in this volume:\n\nNoting \"v\" the speed of the particles and \"n\" is the number of particles per unit volume:\n\nIt follows:\n\nUsing the definition of the neutron flux \"Φ\"\n\nIt follows:\n\nThis average length \"L\" is however valid only for unperturbed particles. To account for the interactions, \"L\" is divided by the total number of reactions \"R\" to obtain the average length between each collision \"λ\":\n\nFrom #Microscopic versus macroscopic cross section:\n\nIt follows:\n\nwhere \"λ\" is the mean free path and \"Σ\" is the macroscopic cross section.\n\nBecause lithium-8 and beryllium-12 form natural stopping points on the table of isotopes for hydrogen fusion, it is believed that all of the higher elements are formed in very hot stars where higher orders of fusion predominate. A star like the Sun produces energy by the fusion of simple H-1 into helium-4 through a series of reactions. It is believed that when the inner core exhausts its H-1 fuel, the Sun will contract, slightly increasing its core temperature until He-4 can fuse and become the main fuel supply. Pure He-4 fusion leads to Be-8, which decays back to 2 He-4; therefore the He-4 must fuse with isotopes either more or less massive than itself to result in an energy producing reaction. When He-4 fuses with H-2 or H-3, it forms stable isotopes Li-6 and Li-7 respectively. The higher order isotopes between Li-8 and C-12 are synthesized by similar reactions between hydrogen, helium, and lithium isotopes.\n\nIn the following, some cross sections which are of importance in a nuclear reactor are given. The thermal cross-section is averaged using a Maxwellian spectrum and the fast cross section is averaged using the uranium-235 fission spectrum. The cross sections are taken from the JEFF-3.1.1 library using JANIS software.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"negligible, less than 0.1% of the total cross section and below the Bragg scattering cutoff\"'\n"}

It was known as Clayton County Airport – Tara Field, which was the name still used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) until 2011. The airport was renamed Atlanta South Regional Airport, which was approved by the airport board of commissioners in December 2011, and was approved by the GDOT and the FAA before it went into effect. It was also known as Henry County Airport from 2013 to 2017.\nAlthough the airport is located in Henry County, it was owned and operated by Clayton County to the north from 1992 until 2011. It is not near most of that county, except for its very small southern tip. The north end of Clayton County has part of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, thus Tara Field served general aviation, especially for the Atlanta Motor Speedway immediately next to it. At its July 12, 2011 meeting, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners voted to sell the airport to Henry County in a deal worth $17.7 million. The Henry County Board of Commissioners agreed to the purchase at a meeting on July 13, 2011, and the sale was completed in August 2011. Henry County paid just $2.7 million toward the purchase price, with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Georgia Department of Transportation funding the balance of $15 million.\n\nThe Henry County Board of Commissioners voted Tuesday, December 4, 2012 to move forward with the runway expansion project, which extended the runway to 5,500 feet and widened it by 25 feet. The project was complete in time for the Labor Day race at Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton.\nThis airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"general aviation\" facility. There is no weather station or FAA flight info reported for this airport.\n\nOn April 15 2013, the airport runway was closed for 2 months to allow for construction on widening of the runway. Phase I of the Airport Expansion began in February 2013 and was completed for the 2013 NASCAR weekend at the nearby Speedway. Expansion consisted of adding 1,000 feet to the 24 end and widening the existing runway 25 feet. At the completion of Phase I, the new runway will be 5,503 feet long by 100 feet wide.\n\nThe airport was originally named Bear Creek Airport and was built in the late 60's and operated by a Mr. Morris.\n\nIn July 2005, the airport and the adjacent speedway were hit by an F2 tornado on the evening of July 6. Millions of dollars in damage was done to the airport, in addition to the tens of millions at the speedway. Four airplanes were flipped over, hangars were torn apart, and fiberglass insulation and sheet metal were plastered into iron fences, along with another plane. The storm was a result of Hurricane Cindy, after it had already been downgraded to a tropical depression after landfall.\n\nAnother severe thunderstorm struck in 2014, causing a downburst with winds at minimal hurricane strength on the evening of September 7th. Planes were again flipped over, destroying six of them and damaging another 15, in addition to relatively minor damage to some hangar doors and other airport facilities.\n\nThe airport has changed its ID from 4A7 to KHMP.\n\nIn 2013 the county changed the facility’s name from Atlanta South Regional Airport to Henry County Airport, and again in 2017 to Atlanta Speedway Airport, owing it to be across the street from Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Turns 1 and 2 are overlook the runway.\n\nSpeedway Motorsports officials have indicated that they will allow the county to use the new name which identifies the airport more closely with the race track facility (aircraft used by teams will fly into the airport), and it will also help increase visibility around the United States for economic development purposes.\n\nThe airport covers an area of 160 acres (65 ha) at an elevation of 874 feet (266 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 6/24 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,500 by 75 feet (1,676 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending June 9, 2011, the airport had 42,000 aircraft operations, an average of 115 per day: 96% general aviation and 4% air taxi. At that time there were 93 aircraft based at this airport: 63% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, 4% jet, 14% helicopter, and 3% ultralight.\n\n"}
{"id": "2191207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191207", "title": "Forward air control", "text": "Forward air control\n\nForward air control is the provision of guidance to close air support (CAS) aircraft intended to ensure that their attack hits the intended target and does not injure friendly troops. This task is carried out by a forward air controller (FAC).\n\nA primary forward air control function is ensuring the safety of friendly troops during close air support. Enemy targets in the front line (\"Forward Edge of the Battle Area\" in US terminology) are often close to friendly forces and therefore friendly forces are at risk of friendly fire through proximity during air attack. The danger is twofold: the bombing pilot cannot identify the target clearly, and is not aware of the locations of friendly forces. Camouflage, a constantly changing situation and the fog of war all increase the risk. Present day doctrine holds that Forward Air Controllers (FACs) are not needed for air interdiction, although there has been such use of FACs in the past.\n\nAn additional concern of forward air controllers is the avoidance of harm to noncombatants in the strike area.\n\nEven as close air support began during World War I, there were pioneer attempts to direct the trench strafing by the ground troops marking their positions by laying out signal panels on the ground, firing flares, or lighting smoke signals. Aircrews had difficulty communicating with the ground troops; they would drop messages or use messenger pigeons. Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg, an Austro-Hungarian pilot, pioneered the use of radio for fire control; at the Battle of Gorlice he used a radio transmitter in his airplane to send changes via morse code to an artillery battery on the ground. Colonel Billy Mitchell also equipped his Spad XVI command airplane with a radio, and the Germans experimented with radios in their Junkers J.I all-metal-structure, armored-fuselage sesquiplanes.\n\nThe Marines in the so-called Banana wars of the 1920s and 1930s used Curtiss Falcons and Vought Corsairs that were equipped with radios powered by airstream-driven generators, with a range of up to 50 miles. Another method of communication was for the pilot to drop messages in a weighted container, and to swoop in and pick up messages hung out by ground troops on a \"clothesline\" between poles. The objective was aerial reconnaissance and air attack. Using these various methods, the Marine pilots combined the functions of both FAC and strike aircraft, as they carried out their own air attacks on the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in 1927. The commonality of pilots and ground troops belonging to the same service led to a close air support role similar to that sought by use of FACs, without the actual use of a FAC. On 27 October 1927, a Marine patrol used cloth panels to direct an air strike—arguably the first forward air control mission. This distinctive U.S. Marine doctrine of interaction between Marine infantry and aviation would persist, recurring in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nFrench colonial operations in the Rif War from 1920–1926 used air power similarly to the Marines in Nicaragua against the Sandinistas but in a different environment, the desert. The French Mobile Groups of combined arms not only used aircraft for scouting and air attack; the airplanes carried trained artillery officers as observers. These aerial observers called in artillery fire via radio.\n\nThe German military noted close air support operations in the Spanish Civil War and decided to develop its forward air control capability. By 1939, they had forward air control teams called Ground Attack Teams attached to every headquarters from regiment level upwards. These Teams directed air strikes flown by Luftwaffe close air support units. Extensive coordinated training by air and ground troops had raised this system to state of the art by the beginning of World War II.\n\nWhen the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was founded on 20 June 1941, it included provisions for Air Ground Control Parties to serve with the United States Army at the division, corps, and Army headquarters. The Air Ground Control Parties functions were to regulate bombing and artillery in close conjunction with the ground troops, as well as assess bomb damage. They were thus the first of similar units to try to fulfill the functions of the FAC without being airborne. However, these units were often plagued by turf wars and cumbersome communications between the respective armies and air forces involved. As a result, it could take hours for an air strike requested by ground troops to actually show up.\n\nHowever, forward air control during World War II came into existence as a result of exigency, and was used in several theaters of World War II. Its reincarnation in action was a result of field expedience rather than planned operations.\nIn the Pacific Theater, 4 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force began forward air control at the Battle of Buna-Gona, New Guinea in November 1942. The RAAF continued forward air control in the Pacific for the rest of the war. By November 1943, the U.S. Marines were using forward air control during the Battle of Bougainville.\n\nOn the Allied side in the European Theater, British forces in North Africa campaign began using the Forward Air Support Links, a \"tentacle\" system that used radio links from front line units to the rear requesting close air support from the next \"cab rank\" of on-call airborne fighter-bombers. The requesting unit would direct the air strikes. The U.S. Army would not copy the British system until the Allied invasion of Italy, but adapted it for use there and in France after the Invasion of Normandy of 6 June 1944.\n\nThe United States would end World War II still without an air control doctrine. When the U.S. Air Force split from the U.S. Army in 1947, neither took on the responsibility for forward air control; the U.S. military thus had no functional forward air control when the Korean War broke out.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Commonwealth continued to build on their experience in the Second World War in various campaigns around the world in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Malayan Emergency, the Suez Crisis, the Indonesian Confrontation and operations in Aden and Oman. With the re-formation of the Army Air Corps in 1957 this new corps's functions included airborne forward air control.\n\nAlthough the United States, as part of the United Nations Command (UNC) in the Korean War, entered the war on 26 June 1950 with no forward air controllers, it rapidly improvised close air support procedures for UNC forces. By 20 July, jury-rigged systems were not only controlling air strikes against the communist foe, but also occasionally directing aerial interceptions of opposing aircraft. Both the U.S. high command and North Korean General Nam Il agreed that only tactical air power saved United Nation forces from defeat during the mobile warfare stage of the war.\n\nWhen the front lines bogged down into static trench warfare in Summer 1951, forward air control diminished in importance. To cope with the communist switch to night operations, both radar and Shoran bombing techniques were developed. However, close air support continued, and sometimes used to direct interdiction missions against the communist lines of communications. By this time, Allied air forces were contributing a considerable portion of the tactical air strikes.\n\nBy the cessation of hostilities, airborne forward air controllers alone were credited with flying 40,354 forward air control sorties, and directing air strikes that killed an estimated 184,808 communist troops. At times, tactical air was credited with inflicting about half of all communist casualties.\n\nDespite having agreed on a common forward air control doctrine as embodied in \"Field Manual 31 - 35 Air-Ground Operations\", a turf war over doctrine raged between the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army for the entire war. Additionally, the U.S. Marine Corps maintained its own FAC operation during the war. Also, U.S. Navy carrier aviation would not completely coordinate its operations with the Air Force/Army system until the final month of the war. With no common doctrine agreed upon during the war, forward air control systems were shut down postwar in 1956.\n\nForward air controllers played a major part in the largest bombing campaign in history during the Vietnam War. While World War II had featured indiscriminate mass air raids on major cities worldwide, bombing during the Vietnam War was aimed at smaller targets in a country the size of New Mexico. Unless bombs were dropped in a free fire zone, or on a pre-briefed target, the bombing in Vietnam was directed by FACs. Also unlike World War II, serious efforts were made to avoid hitting the civilian populace, which also called for FAC intervention.\n\nIn 1961, when forward air control was revived, it promptly ran into the recurring problems of unreliable radios, a shortage of supplies, lack of suitable aircraft, differing concepts of close air support, and unfavorable terrain.\n\nThe first manning requirement for FACs, levied in 1962, amounted to 32 slots in Vietnam. Even as the slots slowly filled, the requirement proved inadequate. The 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron was then assigned in-country in mid-1963 to augment the FAC force. By January 1965, there were still only 144 USAF FACs in Southeast Asia. While the U.S. Air Force would continue to add more FACs, projecting a need for 831 FACs, and stationing four more Tactical Air Support Squadrons in Southeast Asia by April 1965, the manning levels of assigned FACs would run about 70% of need until December 1969. Other branches of the U.S. military also had FACs; the U.S. Army had at least two aviation companies of FACs, the U.S. Marine Corps had an organic FAC squadron within its forces, and the U.S. Navy established its own FAC squadron in the Mekong Delta. U.S. involvement had begun with a South Vietnamese FAC training program; later in the war, Laotians and Hmong were also trained as FACs.\n\nThere was a great deal of technical innovation in forward air control operations during the course of the Vietnam War. The United States came up with a number of ways to make its forward air control system more effective. As early as 1962, Douglas C-47 flareship FACs began the forward air control mission in South Vietnam, mostly on night missions. In September 1965, another C-47 went into action as the first Airborne Command and Control Center. As additional ABCCC aircraft were added, they would constantly govern the air war in Southeast Asia.\n\nBy early 1966, a rising level of communist anti-aircraft fire against propeller-driven FAC aircraft necessitated the use of jet aircraft for FACs in high-risk areas in North Vietnam. The Fast FAC mission would supplement the FAC mission in Southeast Asia until war's end.\n\nIn July 1966, night FAC operations began against the Ho Chi Minh Trail; A-26 Invaders began a dual FAC/strike mission under call sign \"Nimrod\". The U.S. Air Force began Operation Shed Light as a test of night time battlefield illumination. In response to increasing pressure from air strikes, the communists turned entirely to night operations in Vietnam by 1968. C-123 Provider cargo aircraft were used as flareships to light up the Trail and direct air strikes, under the call sign \"Candlestick\", until late 1969. Withdrawn in the face of mounting opposition, the flareships would still serve elsewhere in theater until 30 June 1971. In a similar role, Lockheed AC-130 gunships, call sign \"Blindbat\", not only lit the Trail and directed air strikes, but used its own copious firepower on enemy trucks. The gunships carried both electronic sensors tied into Operation Igloo White and night observation devices for spotting enemy trucks, as well as a computerized fire control system.\n\nOn 1 November 1968, President Lyndon Johnson declared a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam. With that act, the focus of the contending forces became the Ho Chi Minh Trail. As the U.S. more than quadrupled the number of airstrikes aimed at interdiction, North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns and gunners transferred south to the Trail to match this new onslaught. Both sides realized that the supply of military necessities being moved south to insurgents would be crucial to a communist victory. At about this time, the Raven FACs began supporting Vang Pao's Central Intelligence Agency-supported guerrilla army on the Plain of Jars in northern Laos with air strikes serving as aerial artillery blasting the way clear for offensive sweeps by the partisans.\n\nIn early 1970, in an attempt to improve bombing accuracy, the USAF began using laser guided ordnance.\n\nBy May 1971, U.S. Air Force intelligence concluded that air strikes had wiped out all the North Vietnamese trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This was a demonstrably untrue conclusion, as trucks still traversed the Trail until the communist victory in 1975. After war's end, the U.S. Air Force ended the forward air control mission, just as they had following World War II and Korea.\n\nMajor Atma Singh, of the Indian Army, flying a HAL Krishak, played a crucial part in a close air support defense against steep odds. The Pakistani loss of armor in December 1971 was one of the most severe since the great armored clashes of World War II. Major Singh won the Maha Vir Chakra for his performance under heavy ground fire.\n\nDuring the Portuguese Overseas War, the Portuguese Air Force used mainly Dornier Do 27 and OGMA/Auster D.5 light aircraft in the forward air control role, in the several theatres of operation: Angola, Portuguese Guinea and Mozambique.\n\nDuring the Rhodesian Bush War the Rhodesian Air Force mounted Airborne FACs in Aermacchi AL60 B Trojans and Lynx aircraft.\n\nSouth Africa deployed both Airborne FACs (in AM.3CM Bosboks) and ground-based FACs during the Border War including the Battle of Cassinga.\n\nFor NATO forces the qualifications and experience required to be a FAC are set out in a NATO Standard (STANAG). FACs may form part of a Fire Support Team or Tactical Air Control Party, they may be ground based, airborne FACs in fixed-wing aircraft (FAC-A) or in helicopters (ABFAC). Since 2003 the United States Armed Forces have used the term joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) for some of their ground based FACs. \nNATO is making efforts to increase the safety and reduce the risk of fratricide in air to ground operations. Co-operation between different NATO agencies such as the NATO Standardization Agency and the JAPCC resulted in the development of common standards for Forward Air Controllers and these are now set out in STANAG 3797 (Minimum Qualifications for Forward Air Controllers). NATO FACs are trained to request, plan, brief and execute CAS operations both for Low Level and Medium/High Level operations and their training NATO FACs includes electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defences, enemy air defence, air command and control, attack methods and tactics and weaponeering.\n\nFACs in the United Kingdom are trained at the Joint Forward Air Controller Training and Standards Unit (JFACTSU). In light of operational experience, British FACs now form part of Fire Support Teams as well as TACPs able to direct a wide range of fires. FACs are also provided by the Royal Marines (and Royal Marines Reserve) and some from the RAF Regiment Tactical Air Control Parties. The Army Air Corps also provides Airborne Forward Air Controllers.\n\nWhen deployed on operations each USMC infantry company is allocated a FAC or JTAC. Such assignment (designated as a \"B-Billet\") is given to Marine aviators often as they are most knowledgeable about close air support and air superiority doctrines.\n\nThe Afghan National Army (ANA) currently relies on coalition partners to raise and sustain its FAC and Joint Fires Officer (JFO) capability. The ANA capability, known as the Afghan Tactical Air Coordinator maintains a skill equivalency to that of a JFO. Australian JFOs have pioneered this capability within the ANA.\n\n\n\n"}

The duo was founded in 1999 and became a prominent figure of the underground hip hop scene, becoming known for Eyedea's philosophical and socially conscious lyrics, along with DJ Abilities' dynamic experimental fusion of stylistic elements from both rap and rock, as well as electronic music. The group was active until Eyedea's death in October 2010.\n\nOver the course of just over a decade, the duo had collaborated with many well-known hip hop groups and artists such as Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, playing a prominent role in the emerging underground rap movement. Eyedea's highly successful background work in rap battles, along with his greatly introspective, complex and poetic sense of lyrical integrity heavily influenced E&A's distinctive musical output and largely defined the group as a unique and stylistically independent presence within alternative hip hop.\n\nEyedea first became known around the local midwest hip hop circuit for his battling and freestyle skills. Eyedea was best known for his victory at the Blaze Battle, which was aired on HBO and hosted by KRS-One. Afterwards, Eyedea went on to tour as Atmosphere with Slug and other Rhymesayers crew. DJ Abilities was known for winning two DMC awards and for his work on his mixtapes and 1200 Hobos.\n\nEyedea & Abilities made their jump from the battle scene with the release of their debut album \"First Born.\"\n\nFollowing a solo effort by Eyedea in 2002 under the name Oliver Hart, Eyedea and Abilities released \"E&A\" in 2004, which returned Eyedea back to his battle rapper roots, with Vish Khanna from Exclaim! giving it a favorable review, saying: \"Eyedea is a pesky braggadocio, spitting out disses like a mouthy schoolyard bully cracking his crew up at your expense.\"\n\nFollowing \"E&A\", the duo went on an unannounced hiatus, bringing speculation that Eyedea & Abilities were no longer together. However, in August 2007, the duo announced via their MySpace that they would be at the Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop performing old songs, as well as new material.\n\nEyedea & Abilities returned to the road in the Winter of 2007 with their 'Appetite For Distraction Tour'. Accompanied by fellow Minnesota artists Kristoff Krane and Sector7G, the tour was mainly on the west coast until the Spring of 2008 when the duo brought the 'Appetite For Distraction Tour' to listeners in east coast cities. The tour has garnered excitement from fans, as E&A had taken a four-year hiatus, and the duo's next album was one of the most anticipated among the independent hip hop scene. The album \"By the Throat\" was released through Rhymesayers Entertainment on July 21, 2009.\n\nIn 2007, Eyedea created a book of poetry and art with painter Louis N. LaPierre, who is also responsible for Face Candy's 'This Is Where We Were' album art. The book was titled 'Once A Queen... Always A Creep'. Only 80 copies were made. It was on sale during Eyedea & Abilities 'Appetite For Distraction' Tour.\n\nOn October 16, 2010, Micheal Larsen's mother found him dead in his home as a result of an opiate toxicity. Ramsey County officials ruled the opiate overdose accidental.\n\nEyedea & Abilities has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was produced by Casablanca Records president Neil Bogart, as the label's financial situation at the time did not permit the hiring of a professional producer.\n\n\"Dressed to Kill\" was re-released in 1997 in a remastered version. Possibly due to the short length of the album, original vinyl versions had long pauses between each track to create the illusion that the sides were longer than they were. Each side ran just 15 minutes, and some of the song times were listed incorrectly on the vinyl versions. For example, \"Two Timer\" was listed at 2:59 and \"Ladies in Waiting\" was listed at 2:47.\n\nWhile the album cover depicts Kiss in business suits, the only member of the band who actually owned one was Peter Criss. The suits worn on the cover by the rest of the band were owned by manager Bill Aucoin. The original vinyl release of the album also had the Kiss logo embossed around the picture. The photograph of the band on the album cover was taken on the southwest corner of 23rd Street and 8th Avenue looking north in New York City.\n\n\"Dressed to Kill\" peaked at No. 32 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart in the US and was certified gold by the RIAA on February 28, 1977. \"C'mon and Love Me\" and \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" were released as singles but failed to rise up the charts.

It precisely asks how something like objectivity is possible in the first place. Phenomenology has also made important contributions to most areas of philosophy. Contemporary phenomenology is a somewhat heterogeneous field.The contributions of phenomenology in architecture are among the most significant and lasting in architecture, due to architecture's direct involvement with experience.\n\nThe phenomenology of architecture is the philosophical study of architecture. In contrast, architectural phenomenology is a movement within architecture beginning in the 1950s, reaching a wide audience in the late 1970s and 1980s, and continuing until today. Architectural phenomenology, with its emphasis on human experience, background, intention and historical reflection, interpretation and poetic and ethical considerations stood in sharp contrast to the anti-historicism of postwar modernism and the pastiche of postmodernism. It was never a movement proper because it did not have an immediate aesthetic associated with it, thus is should be understood as more of an orientation to thinking and making.\n\nAmerican architects first started seriously studying phenomenology at Princeton University in the 1950s under Prof. Jean Labatut, whose student Charles W. Moore was the first to write a PhD dissertation, titled Water and Architecture (1958), that drew heavily on the philosophy of Gaston Bachelard. In Europe, Milanese architect Ernesto Nathan Rogers, through his influential editorship of the journal Casabella Continuità helped to advance architectural phenomenology in Europe. He collaborated with philosopher Enzo Paci, and influenced a generation of young architects including Vittorio Gregotti and Aldo Rossi. By the 1970s, the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian Christian Norberg-Schulz achieved international acclaim with his book \"Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture\" (1979), which was markedly influenced by Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic ontology. Christian Norberg-Schulz was, for many architecture students of the 1980s, an important reference in architectural phenomenology, especially because the combination of texts and images in his books provided readily accessible explanations for how a phenomenological approach to architecture could be translated into designs. Norberg-Schulz spawned a wide following, including his successor at the Oslo School of Architecture, Thomas Thiis-Evensen. In the 1970s, the School of Comparative Studies at the University of Essex, under the direction of Dalibor Vesely and Joseph Rykwert, was the breeding ground for a generation of architectural phenomenologists, which included David Leatherbarrow, professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, Alberto Pérez-Gómez, professor of architectural history and theory at McGill University, the architect Daniel Libeskind. In the 1980s, the phenomenological approach to architecture was continued and further developed by Vesely and his colleague Peter Carl in their research and teaching at the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge. As architectural phenomenology became established in academia, professors developed theory seminars that tried to expand the movement's range of ideas beyond Gaston Bachelard, and Martin Heidegger, to include Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Hans-Georg Gadamer Hannah Arendt and an ever wider group of theorists whose modes of thinking bordered on phenomenology, such as Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson, Paul Virilio, Charles Taylor, Hubert Dreyfus and Edward S. Casey.\n\nThe phenomenon of dwelling was one research theme in architectural phenomenology. Much of the way it was understood in architecture was shaped by the later thought of Martin Heidegger as set in his influential essay: \"Building Dwelling Thinking.\" He links dwelling to what he refers as the \"gathering of the fourfold,\" namely the regions of being as entailed by the phenomena of: \"the saving of earth, the reception of sky (heavens), the initiation of mortals into their death, and the awaiting/remembering of divinities.\" The essence of dwelling is not architectural, per se, in the same manner that the essence of technology for him is not technological per se.\n\nProminent architects, such as Daniel Libeskind, Steven Holl, and Peter Zumthor were described by Juhani Pallasmaa as current practitioners of the phenomenology of architecture.\n\nNotable architects and scholars of architecture who are associated with architectural phenomenology include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2191232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191232", "title": "Sport in Mexico", "text": "Sport in Mexico\n\nThe most popular sport in Mexico currently is association football followed by boxing. However, there are regional variations: for example, baseball is the most popular sport in the northwest and the southeast of the country. Basketball, American football and bull riding (called \"Jaripeo\") are also popular. The tradition of bullfighting remains strong in Mexico.\n\nThe Pre-Columbian people of Mesoamerica have played the Mesoamerican ball game for over 3,000 years. Archaeologists found the oldest ballcourt yet discovered – dated to approximately 1400 BC – at Paso de la Amada in Mexico. The exact rules of the traditional ballgame remain unknown. Researchers believe that the sport probably resembled racquetball or volleyball, where the object is to keep the ball in play.\n\nIn their Post-Classical Era (1000–1697 CE), the Maya began placing vertical stone rings on each side of the court, with the object of passing the ball through one. Several of these were placed quite high, as at Chichen Itza, where they stand 6 meters from the ground. Players would strike the ball with their hips or forearms, or employed rackets, bats, or hand-stones.\n\nThe ball was made of solid rubber and weighed up to 4 kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played. Games took place between two individuals and between two teams of players. The ballgame played out within a large masonry structure which contained a long narrow playing alley flanked by walls with both horizontal and sloping (or, more rarely, vertical) surfaces. The walls were often plastered and brightly painted.\nA version of the game called Ulama is still played in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Spanish introduced bullfighting to colonial Mexico. The sport has been one of the most popular in the country for the last 400 years. One of the most prominent bullfighters of the 20th century in Mexico was Carlos Arruza. He was known as \"El Ciclón\" (\"The Cyclone\").\n\nTypically, a bullfight in Mexico includes a variety of rodeo events known as charreadas, and traditional folkloric dances. Thousands of bullfighting events occur in Mexico. In certain areas of the country, bullfighting generates a large amount of revenue from the local population, as well as visiting tourists.\n\nAs evidence of the popularity of the sport, the largest bullring in the world is the Plaza Mexico, located in Mexico City. The Plaza México has been host to many of the world's best and most famous bullfighters. The anniversary of the 1946 opening of Plaza Mexico is celebrated annually with a special bullfight called the \"Corrida de Aniversario\".\n\nCharrería is the national sport of Mexico, it dates back to the 16th century and consists of a series of Mexico-developed equestrian events. The most notable event is the charreada, a style of rodeo developed in Mexico in the interest of maintaining the traditions of the charro. A charro is a term referring to a traditional horseman or a cowboy of Mexico, originating in the state of Jalisco. The national horse of Mexico, used in Charreria, is the Azteca.\n\nThe Federación Mexicana de Charrería (Mexican Federation of Charreria) organizes charrería events.\n\nCockfighting is not banned in Mexico, and practiced in the Mexican states of Michoacán, Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Sinaloa, and Veracruz, mostly during regional fairs and other celebrations. Cockfights are performed in \"palenques\" (pits). Cockfighting remains legal in the municipality of Ixmiquilpan and throughout Mexico.\n\nMexico City hosted the 1968 Summer Olympics, the first time that the event was held in Latin America. Since then, the only edition of the Olympic Games held in the region was in 2016, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nMexico first participated at the Olympic Games in 1900 and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since 1924. Mexico has also participated in several Winter Olympic Games since 1928. Mexico has performed best in athletics, boxing, equestrian, diving, and Swimming events, and more recently taekwondo and football.\n\nEnriqueta Basilio made history by being the first woman to light the Olympic Cauldron at 19th Summer Olympics in Mexico City on 12 October 1968.\n\nIn diving, Mexico is the best Latin American representative with a long tradition of diving founded by Joaquín Capilla, a Mexican diver who won the largest number of Olympic medals among Mexican athletes. Many others who have excelled in World Championships and Olympics are Carlos Girón, Fernando Platas and Paola Espinosa who is the first latina woman to become world champion. Soraya Jiménez became the first ever female athlete from Mexico to win an Olympic gold medal in 2000.\n\nAt the 2012 Summer Olympics, Mexico finished in thirty-ninth place; the Mexico team brought home seven medals, including their first gold medal won in football, and the rest of the medals in archery, diving, and taekwondo.\n\nThe Pan American Games competition is held among athletes from nations of the Americas, every four years in the year before the Summer Olympic Games. Mexico Ranks 6th in the top ten nations all time at the Pan American Games (minus medals won at the Winter Pan American Games). Mexico and Canada have hosted three Pan American Games each, more than any other nation. Among cities, only Winnipeg and Mexico City have played host to the Pan American Games more than once, each holding that honor twice.\n\nSimilar to the Olympic flame, the Pan American Games flame is lit well before the Games are to commence. The flame was lit for the first games in Olympia, Greece. For subsequent games, the torch has been lit by Aztec people. in ancient temples, first in the Cerro de la Estrella and later in the Pyramid of the Sun at the Teotihuacan Pyramids. The only exception was for the São Paulo games in 1963, when the torch was lit in Brasília by the indigenous Guaraní people. An Aztec then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Pan American Games torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's main stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony.\n\nThe Central American and Caribbean Games a multi-sport regional championship event, held quadrennial (once every four years), typically in the middle (even) year between Summer Olympics. The Games are for countries in Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, and the South American Caribbean countries of Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. They are designed to provide a step between sub-CACG-region Games held the first year following a Summer Olympics (e.g. Central American Games) and the Continental Championships, the Pan American Games, held the year before the Summer Olympics. The CACGs are the oldest continuing regional games in the world, and only the Olympics have run longer. Mexico has hosted four times the games Three in Mexico city and on in Veracruz in 2014. Mexico is also one of the three countries present at the first games and the first organizer of the Games. Mexico is the only country that has attended all editions, without a single absence and has the most medals and second most gold medals as of 2019.\n\nMexico's most popular team sport is association football. Football is widely followed and practiced all over the country and it is considered the most popular sport in most states. It is believed that football was introduced in Mexico by English Cornish miners at the end of the 19th century. By 1902 a five-team league emerged with a strong English influence. Football became a professional sport in 1943.\n\nMexico has hosted two World Cup tournaments (1970 and 1986). Many of the stadiums in use in the league have a World Cup history. Sites such as Estadio Jalisco in Guadalajara, and Estadio Azteca in Mexico City are renowned for their national and international history. The legendary Estadio Azteca, for example, is one of the only two stadiums in the world to have hosted two men's World Cup finals (the other being the Maracana) and is one of the highest capacity stadiums in the world. Mexican's biggest stadiums are Estadio Azteca, Estadio Jalisco, Estadio BBVA Bancomer, Estadio Olímpico Universitario and Estadio Cuauhtémoc.\n\nThe 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico was broadcast to a global audience, and the wave or the Mexican wave was popularized worldwide after featuring during the tournament.\n\nThe Mexico national football team (Spanish: Selección de fútbol de México) represents Mexico in association football and is governed by the Mexican Football Federation (FMF, from the native name of \"Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación\"), the governing body for football in Mexico. Mexico's home stadium is the Estadio Azteca and their head coach is Juan Carlos Osorio. The team is currently ranked 21st in the World Football Elo Ratings.\nMexico has qualified for fifteen FIFA World Cups and has qualified consecutively since 1994, making it one of six countries to do so. The Mexico national team, along with Brazil and Germany, are the only nations to make it out of the group stage over the last six World Cups. Mexico played France in the very first match of the first World Cup on July 13, 1930. Mexico's best progression was reaching the quarter-finals in the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, both of which were staged on Mexican soil, and will host once again in 2026 sharing with Canada and United States.\n\nThe Mexico national football team won the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup and the Gold Medal in London 2012, finished twice as runners-up at the Copa América, won the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and have reached the quarter finals twice at the World Cup. Recently, some players from Mexico have moved on to European clubs, including Rafael Márquez, Carlos Salcido, Ricardo Osorio, Pável Pardo, Andrés Guardado, Guillermo Franco, Carlos Vela, Giovani dos Santos, Omar Bravo, Aaron Galindo, Héctor Moreno, Francisco Javier Rodríguez and others.\n\nMexico is historically the most successful national team in the CONCACAF region, holding nine CONCACAF championships, including six CONCACAF Gold Cups, one North American Nations Cup and three NAFC Championships. Mexico is the only team from CONCACAF to have won an official FIFA competition, the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup. Although Mexico is under the jurisdiction of CONCACAF, the national football team has been regularly invited to compete in the Copa América since 1993 finishing as runner-up twice and obtaining the third place medal on three occasions.\n\nThe first Mexican club, C.F. Pachuca, survives. Since 1996, the country has played two split seasons instead of a traditional long season. There are two separate playoff and league divisions. This system is common throughout Latin America. After many years of calling the regular seasons as \"Verano\" (Summer) and \"Invierno\" (Winter); the top-level Liga MX, formerly the \"Primera División\", has changed the names of the competition, and has opted for a traditional name of \"Apertura\" (opening) and \"Clausura\" (closing) events. The Apertura division begins in the middle of Mexico's summer and ends before the official start of winter. The Clausura division begins during the New Year, and concludes in the spring season.\n\nMexican football is divided into four divisions, beginning with Liga MX and followed by Ascenso MX, the Liga Premier, and Tercera División. The bottom two leagues translate literally as \"Second Division\" and \"Third Division\"; their names reflect their former positions in the league hierarchy before the Segunda División was split into two leagues, with the league now known as Ascenso MX becoming the new second level.\n\nThe teams are promoted and relegated by the FMF based on percentage calculations. Relegation is a common practice in Mexican football. There is a club exchange of each tier with the adjacent tiers so that a division's least successful team is relegated (transferred) to the next lower tier and the most successful club of the lower tier is promoted to the tier above. By the placement of each, the top tier cannot promote and the bottom tier cannot relegate.\n\nThe relegation system does not punish clubs for producing a single poor season. Mexican clubs are assessed on their previous five campaigns. Points are accumulated for five seasons, and are divided by the number of matches played. The club with the lowest percentage in the Apertura is relegated to a lower division. Each team must earn their promotions.\n\nSince 1943, Mexico's five most successful clubs in Mexican football league system matches have been América (13 championships), Chivas (12), Toluca (10), Cruz Azul (8) and Pumas (7). America is the historical arch-nemesis of Chivas, so a match between the two is the Clásico Nacional derby that the entire country awaits. Another noted derby in Mexico is the Clásico Regiomontano between crosstown rival teams Monterrey and Tigres. Whereas the Clásico Nacional involves two teams from cities in different states the Clásico Regiomontano game involves two neighboring cities. Chivas are renowned for using only Mexican players in their squad. Consequently, they have long fed players to the Mexico national football team.\n\nHugo Sánchez widely regarded as the greatest Mexican footballer of all time, was named best CONCACAF player of the 20th century by IFFHS. No other Mexican footballer has scored as many goals in Europe as Hugo Sánchez. He is the fourth highest scorer in the history of La Liga, the third highest scoring foreign player after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Rafael Márquez the first Mexican to win the UEFA Champions League is considered by many the best defender in the country's football history. Márquez is Mexico's record World Cup player and one of only three players with appearances in five tournaments. Cuauhtémoc Blanco is the only Mexican football player to be presented with an award (The Silver Ball and Silver Shoe) in a major international FIFA competition (1999 FIFA Confederations Cup). He shares the record as the highest scorer of the tournament with Ronaldinho (nine goals in two editions). He has been awarded the MVP of the México Primera División League five times. Jorge Campos with the national team, appeared in three World Cups, two Confederation Cups, two Gold Cups and three Copas América. Horacio Casarín was sought out by defenders and fouled him mercilessly during a 1939 game between Casarin's Necaxa, and Asturias F.C., Necaxa fans were so angry that they burnt the Parque Asturias stadium. Horacio retired as the all-time Mexican scorer, with 256 goals to his count. Antonio Carbajal was the first player to appear in five World Cups and the only Mexican player that has received the FIFA Order of Merit. Claudio Suárez is the most capped player in the history of Mexico national team with 178 caps. As of 2006, it was estimated that Mexico has over 324,000 registered players and 8,155,000 unregistered players.\n\nThe Mexico women's national football team boasts one silver (1971) and one bronze (1970) in the Women's World Cup, though these accomplishments are not officially recognized, as they took place prior to FIFA's recognition of the women's game.\n\nMexico stopped allocating players to the NWSL management of the United States, having established its own women's league the Liga MX Femenil in 2017, and the numbers of allocated players and international players on each team vary each year due to trades. Maribel Domínguez was a noted captain and leading scorer of the Mexico women's national football team. She is known internationally as \"Marigol\" for her record of 46 goals scored in 49 matches for the Mexico women's national team.\n\nBeach football is a variant of the sport of association football which was invented in Brazil. It is played on beaches, and emphasizes skill, agility and goal scoring. The FIFA Beach Football World Cup has been held annually since 2005. Mexico finished as runners up to Brazil in its first appearance at the 2007 Beach Football World Cup.\n\nRecently indoor association football has become a popular sport in Mexico, being included as part of the Universiada (University National Games) and the \"CONADEIP\" (Private School Tournament), which match University school teams from all over Mexico. In Mexico, \"indoor\" football fields are commonly built outdoors, and the sport is known as \"fútbol rápido\" (fast football).\n\nThe Mexican team Monterrey La Raza joined the Major Indoor football League in 2007 and finished the season in second place during its inaugural year. A previous version of Monterrey La Raza (1992–2001) won three championships in the now defunct organizations Continental Indoor Football League and World Indoor Football League.\n\nBaseball has been traditionally known as the most popular sport in some regions of Mexico, mainly in Sonora and Sinaloa and arguably in Oaxaca, Yucatán, Campeche and Tabasco, where football is also widely followed. Other states where baseball has had some tradition include Baja California, Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila, Veracruz, Puebla, Nuevo León and Quintana Roo, yet overshadowed by football in popularity. Nevertheless, Mexico has had relative success in the sport, probably just behind boxing and comparable to the success obtained in football.\n\nAlthough there is some dispute about exactly when and where baseball started in Mexico, baseball has a long and colorful history in Mexico, particularly in the north, with historians placing its origin there as early as the 1840s. Today, baseball flourishes in Mexico, where it is played professionally in both summer and winter.\n\nOver 100 Mexicans have played in the major leagues in the United States, including Cy Young Award winner Fernando Valenzuela, top 300 home run hitter Vinny Castilla, Gold Glove Award winner Aurelio Rodríguez, and AL batting champion Bobby Ávila. The first Mexican to play in Major League Baseball in the United States was Mel Almada, who participated with the Boston Red Sox in 1933.\n\nThe Mexican Baseball League (\"Liga Mexicana de Béisbol\" or \"LMB\") was founded in 1925, establishing six teams, and playing all their matches in Mexico City. In the 1930s and 1940s, African-Americans from the United States – who were still barred from Major League Baseball until Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947 – played alongside Mexicans and Cubans in the Mexican League. In 1937, legendary Negro Leagues' stars Satchel Paige and \"Cool Papa Bell\" left the Pittsburgh Crawfords to play in Latin America. After playing a year in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Paige and Bell joined the Mexican League.\n\nIn the 1940s, multi-millionaire Jorge Pasquel attempted to turn the Mexican League into a first-rate rival to the major leagues in the United States. In 1946, Pasquel traveled north of the border to pursue the top players in the Negro and major leagues. Pasquel signed up close to twenty major leaguers, including such well known names as Mickey Owen and Sal Maglie, and a number of Negro league players. Ultimately, Pasquel's dream faded, as financial realities led to decreased salaries and his high-priced foreign stars returned home.\n\nCurrently, 16 teams divided into North and South Divisions play in the Mexican Baseball League in a summer season, which ends in a 7-game championship series between the winners of the two divisions. Since 1967, the league has been sanctioned as an AAA minor league, though no team has an affiliation with any team in the United States.\n\nIn the winter, eight teams play in the Mexican Pacific League (\"Liga Mexicana del Pacífico\" or \"LMP\"), whose winner advances to the Caribbean Series against other Latin American champions. Although the Mexican League has a longer history, the Mexican Pacific League is the premier baseball league in Mexico today. It is played during the Major League Baseball (MLB) off-season, so many MLB players also compete in the LMP.\n\nThe Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted 167 players, consisting of 138 Mexicans, 16 Cubans, 12 from the United States, and one Puerto Rican. Distinguished players include MLB stars Roy Campanella and Monte Irvin, who played in the Mexican League in the 1940s. Nicknamed \"El Bambino Mexicano\", or the Mexican Babe Ruth, Héctor Espino was inducted in the Mexican Hall of Fame in 1988, after playing with San Luis Potosí, and Tampico from 1962 to 1984. His 453 home runs remained the record until Nelson Barrera surpassed him in 2001. Espino still holds the all-time records in many offensive categories.\n\nThe Mexico national baseball team represents Mexico in international tournaments, most notably the World Baseball Classic. In the Bronze Medal Game of the Premier12 tournament in Tokyo, Mexico defeated USA, 3-2, in 10 innings to earn a spot in the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nBasketball is the third most popular team sport in Mexico. Mexico has a few professional basketball leagues, the top professional league is the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional where the Halcones UV Xalapa are the most successful team of the league, having won the competition four times. The best teams of the LNBP advance to the FIBA Americas League. In the northwestern states is the CIBACOPA competition, with professional basketball players from Mexico and U.S. universities. This regional league have a stake in the rest months of the LNBP.\n\nManuel Raga is the first and only Mexican inducted in the FIBA Hall of Fame. In 1996 Horacio Llamas made history by becoming the first Mexican to participate in an NBA game. Since then, several Mexicans followed, including Eduardo Nájera, Earl Watson, Gustavo Ayón and Jorge Gutiérrez; also, Manuel Raga and Gustavo Ayón had notable triumphs in the European Basket, as the only Mexican champions in the EuroLeague.\n\nThe best results of the National team is the 1st place in the 2013 Americas Championship, for qualify to the 2014 Basketball World Cup, where it reached the playoffs, the team also won the Bronze Medal in Berlin 1936.

The LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. There are plans to expand the league and increase the number of teams and the number of participating states.

The team that became champion of the first season are the Pioneros de Querétaro (Pioneers of Querétaro).\n\nBefore this professional league was founded, the maximum competition of American football in Mexico was at the college level. American football has been played in Mexico since the early 1920s in different colleges and universities, mainly in Mexico City. In 1928 the first college championship was played, organized by Jorge Braniff. Over successive decades, more universities and colleges joined the championship, and four categories, called \"Fuerzas\", were created. The First Fuerza became the National League in 1970.

{"id": "2191243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191243", "title": "Standard Reference Method", "text": "Standard Reference Method\n\nThe Standard Reference Method or SRM is one of several systems modern brewers use to specify beer color. Determination of the SRM value involves measuring the attenuation of light of a particular wavelength (430 nm) in passing through 1 cm of the beer, expressing the attenuation as an absorption and scaling the absorption by a constant (12.7 for SRM; 25 for EBC). \n\nThe SRM (or EBC) number represents a single point in the absorption spectrum of beer. As such it cannot convey full color information which would require 81 points, but it does remarkably well in this regard (it conveys 92% of spectral information) even when fruit beers are considered. \n\nAuxiliary \"deviation coefficients\" (see Augmented SRM below) can pick up the remainder and are necessary for fruit beers and when subtle color differences in malt beers are to be characterized.\n\nThe ASBC and EBC measurements are now identical (both done at the same wavelength and in the same size cuvette) but the scaling is different. \n\nA photometer or spectrophotometer is used to measure the attenuation of deep blue (violet) light at 430 nm, as it passes through 1 cm of beer contained in a standard 1 cm by 1 cm cuvette. The absorption is the log of the ratio of the intensity of the light beam entering the sample to the intensity leaving. This difference is multiplied by 12.7 in the SRM system and 25 in the EBC (see below). \n\nFor example, if the light intensity leaving is one one-hundredth the light intensity entering the ratio is 100, the absorption is 2 and the SRM is 25.4. The scale factor derives from the original definition of SRM discussed in the next paragraph.\nThe SRM number was originally, and still is, defined by \"Beer color intensity on a sample free of turbidity and having the spectral characteristics of an average beer is 10 times the absorbance of the beer measured in a 1/2-inch cell with monochromatic light at 430 nanometers.\" Modern spectrophotometers use 1 cm cuvettes rather than 1/2 inch ones. When a 1 cm cuvette is used, application of the Bouguer-Beer-Lambert law shows that the multiplier should be 12.7 rather than 10. When the SRM value for a beer or wort is larger than about 30 the log linear limit of some instruments using 1 cm cuvettes is approached. In such cases the sample is diluted with deionized water. Using Beer-Lambert again gives the mathematical definition of SRM in the general case as: \n\nwhere formula_2 is the dilution factor (formula_3 for undiluted samples, formula_4 for 1:1 dilution etc.) and formula_5 the absorbance at 430 nm in 1 cm.\n\nThe 430-nanometer wavelength corresponds to a deep blue (violet) light, and was chosen, as was the multiplier, to make values determined in the SRM system comparable to those determined using the Lovibond system in use at the time the SRM was adopted.\n\nThe SRM was adopted in 1950 by the American Society of Brewing Chemists which had recognized the need for an instrument based measurement of color unburdened by the difficulties of the Lovibond system which relies (it is still in use in many industries including brewing malts are often labeled with the Lovibond color of laboratory worts prepared from them) on visual comparison of the sample to tinted glass discs. Beer colors measured in SRM and degrees Lovibond were, as noted above, approximately equal at the time of adoption of the SRM. However, modern analytical methods show that SRM and Lovibond diverge for darker colors. Comparison of EBC and Lovibond data published by modern malsters shows that the relationship between SRM and Lovibond (ºL) is:\n\nThe EBC system of color measurement is similar to the SRM. Measurements are taken at 430 nm in a 1 cm cell but the unit of color is 25 times the dilution factor times A as opposed to 12.7 times the dilution factor times A so that\n\nThus EBC is approximately twice SRM and this applies at any color depth. The agreement between SRM and Lovibond is fair for pale beers (10 °L ~ 12.7 SRM) but worsens for darker beers or worts (40 °L ~ 53.4 SRM).\n\nBoth systems demand that the beer be free of turbidity prior to the measurement at 430 nm. In the SRM a second measurement is taken at 700 nm. If the absorption at this wavelength is less than 0.039 (this number comes from ) times the absorption at 430 nm the beer is considered turbidity free. If not, it is to be filtered or centrifuged and the reading repeated. If the ratio test is not passed after clarification then the beer does not have \"average spectral characteristics\" and, technically, is not qualified to be characterized by the SRM method. The augmented SRM method described below removes this difficulty.\n\nIn the EBC system the beer is required to be filtered if its turbidity is more than 1 EBC turbidity unit (equivalent to 1 FTU). No absorption measurement is made other than at 430 nm. (the turbidimeter measures scattering at 650 nm).\n\nNote that an earlier version of EBC color was based on absorption at 530 nanometers, which permitted no direct conversion between the two systems. However, if one assumes a linear log absorption spectrum (the Linner hypothesis from the realm of caramel color), and knows the Linner Hue Index, formula_9, the absorptions are related by:\n\nA formula for converting between the old EBC color value and SRM sometimes continues to appear in literature. It should not be used, as it is flawed and based on measurements which are no longer taken.\n\nPart of the problem with this formula is that beer spectra are \"not\" log linear. The absorption of 1 cm of a beer with \"average spectral characteristics\" (average here means the average of the absorption spectra of the ensemble of 99 beers as described in) at wavelength formula_11 is well described by\n\nWhile it is clear that one could use this formula to compute A from the SRM measured at 430 nm and thus interconvert between SRM and old EBC this is not where its value lies. Because it represents, at least approximately, the full absorption spectrum of the beer it can be used to calculate the tristimulus color (three color coordinates in a chosen color space which describes the color an observer actually sees) of a beer of known SRM by following the prescription of ASTM E-308.\n\nThere has been interest in tristimulus reporting in the brewing community in recent years and the ASBC has an approved Method of Analysis [MOA] for tristimulus characterization. The absorption of the sample is measured in 1 cm at 81 wavelengths separated by 5 nm starting at 380 nm and extending to 780 nm. These are converted to transmission values (by taking the antilogarithm of each absorption) and inserting the results into ASTM E-308. The reported tristimulus values are in Lab color space and describe what is seen under Illuminant C (daylight) by a 10° observer when the path is 1 cm. The choice of path, illuminant, observer and color space does not represent a limitation of E-308 but rather the ASBC's need to standardize reporting.\n\nIf we are given only the SRM value for a beer we can compute the approximate transmission spectrum if the beer has average spectral characteristics simply by taking the antilog of formula_13:\n\nThis can be used with E-308 to calculate tristimulus color in any path, for any illuminant, for either observer in any colorspace derivable from CIE XYZ space. This formula could, for example, be used to compute color patches to be printed on transparency or card stock for use in evaluating the SRM of actual beers but color swatches prepared in this way are only valid for the illuminant, observer and path used in the E-308 calculation. The BJCP color guide was prepared in this way. This illustrates that the SRM does convey full color information if the beer has average spectral characteristics. If it does not then we need more information than just the SRM provides.\n\nRecent research has shown that the transmission spectrum of a beer (with no restriction on its spectral characteristics) can be represented by:\n\nformula_15\n\nwhere the formula_16 are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the normalized transmission spectra of the ensemble of beers from which the average normalized spectrum (the sum of the two exponential terms in parentheses in the formula_13 formula) was determined and formula_18, formula_19 etc. are obtained as the dot products of the eigenvectors with the normalized transmission spectrum of the beer being characterized. This formula is identical to the one given previously with the exception that it has been augmented by the formula_20 coefficients which encode the deviation of the sample normalized spectrum from the average normalized spectrum. Where the sample beer has a normalized spectrum close to the average the c's are small and it is remarkable how often this is the case. Typically one or two augmentation coefficients are sufficient and they are frequently small enough that one or more can be neglected. For example, an imported ale with SRM equal to 6.8 has coefficients -0.07 and -0.1. Using both these coefficients one obtains color accuracy of less than one Lab space unit (the limit of perception) in up to a 10 cm path under Illuminant C. Using just the SRM for this beer gives a reasonably good description of its color with error of about 4 Lab units. Beers which deviate dramatically from the \"average\" spectrum are easily accommodated. Thus a sample of Kriek Lambic (Belgian cherry beer), has an SRM of 15.27. Were its color to be reconstructed from just the SRM it would be the color of an \"average\" beer which will be dark amber not the red of a Kriek. Including 3 coeffiecents (1.8, 0.8 and -0.1) yields color accuracy of less than 1 Lab unit in paths up to 8 cm again under Illuminant C.\n\nAugmented SRM is advantageous relative to the ASBC tristimulus method in that color under any viewing circumstances can be computed in addition to which the familiar SRM rating is retained. Because of metamerism one cannot, in the general case of non zero deviation coefficients, estimate the original spectrum from the Lab values reported by the ASBC method.\n\n"}

It was historically considered the third largest and most prominent town in the Tibet region (after Lhasa, and Shigatse), but there are now at least ten larger Tibetan cities.\n\nThe town is strategically located in the Nyang Chu valley on the ancient trade routes from the Chumbi Valley, Yatung and Sikkim, which met here. From Gyantse, routes led to Shigatse downstream and also over the Kora La (Pass) to Central Tibet. The fortress (constructed in 1390) guarded the southern approaches to the Yarlung Tsangpo Valley and Lhasa. The town was surrounded by a wall 3 km long.\n\nIn 1952, Gyantse had a population of perhaps 8,000 people, about the same as in 2008. It is 3,977 meters (13,050 ft) above sea level, and is located 254 km southwest of Lhasa in the fertile plain of the Nyang river valley and on a side branch of the Friendship Highway, which connects Kathmandu, Nepal to Lhasa. Gyantse was the third largest city in Tibet before being overtaken by Qamdo.\n\nA British military garrison, consisting mainly of Indian soldiers, was stationed at Gyantse in the first half of the 20th century. It was referred to as a \"small\" outfit by Sir Walter Buchanan in 1919. Under the reign of the 13th Dalai Lama, it served as a military school to help train Tibetan officers. One Hank Baker, a radio operator posted in Tibet in World War II , is reported to have inspected \"the Indian army garrison\" \"at Gyantse fort\" in 1938. In 1940 the town was still garrisoned by British military.\n\nGyantse is notable for its restored Gyantse Dzong or fort, and its magnificent tiered Kumbum (literally: '100,000 images') of the Palcho Monastery, the largest chörten in Tibet. The Kumbum was commissioned by a Gyantse prince in 1427 and was an important centre of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. This religious structure contains 77 chapels in its six floors, and is illustrated with over 10,000 murals, many showing a strong Nepali influence, which have survived almost entirely intact. They are the last of its kind to be found in Tibet. Many of the restored clay statues are of less artistry than the destroyed originals - but they are still spectacular.\n\nThe town was nearly destroyed by flooding in 1954. After rioting in 1959, local industries were dismantled and artisans fled while others were placed in workcamps. Some 400 monks and laypeople were imprisoned in the monastery. During the Cultural Revolution, the fort, the monastery and Kumbum were ransacked. Precious objects were destroyed or sent out of Tibet. The chorten was spared.\n\nThe main building of the Pelkor Chode or Palcho Monastery and the Kumbum have been largely restored but the \"dzong\" or fort is still largely in ruins. There is an \"Anti-British Imperialism Museum\" there which gives the PRC version of the 1904 British invasion.The sculpture that forms the centerpiece of the museum are two \"Tibetan\" warriors, but they were based on photos taken by Lt. G. J. Davys in Chumbi Valley of non-Tibetans doing fake battles, and the armor were worn backwards.\n\nGyantse has an elevation-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: \"Dwb\"). \n"}
{"id": "2191262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191262", "title": "Lake Borgne", "text": "Lake Borgne\n\nLake Borgne () is a lagoon of the Gulf of Mexico in southeastern Louisiana. Although early maps show it as a lake surrounded by land, coastal erosion has made it an arm of the Gulf of Mexico. Its name comes from the French word \"borgne\", which means \"one-eyed.\"\n\nIn southern Louisiana, three large lakes—Maurepas, Pontchartrain, and Borgne—cover 55% of the Pontchartrain Basin. A brackish marsh land bridge and Lake St. Catherine separate Lake Pontchartrain from Lake Borgne. The Rigolets and Chef Menteur Pass are the two open water connections between Pontchartrain and Borgne.\nDue to coastal erosion, Borgne is now a lagoon connecting to the Gulf of Mexico. Early 18th-century maps show Borgne as a true lake, largely separated from the Gulf by a considerable extent of wetlands that have since disappeared. \n\nIn a 1902 case before the United States Supreme Court over the oyster banks at the boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi, the State of Mississippi argued that at the time of Louisiana's admission into the Union, there probably was no such \"Lake Borgne\" or \"Mississippi Sound\".\n\nThe basin contains 483,390 acres (1956 km²) of wetlands, consisting of nearly 38,500 acres (156 km²) of fresh marsh, 28,600 acres (116 km²) of intermediate marsh, 116,800 acres (473 km²) of brackish marsh, 83,900 acres (340 km²) of saline marsh, and 215,600 acres (873 km²) of cypress swamp. Since 1932, more than 66,000 acres (267 km²) of marsh have converted to water in the Pontchartrain Basin—over 22% of the marsh that existed in 1932.\n\nThe primary causes of wetland loss in the basin are the interrelated effects of human activities and the estuarine processes that began to predominate many hundreds of years ago. The Mississippi River delta was abandoned by natural changes in the river.\n\nIn response to the extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed the 1.8-mile-long (2.9 km) IHNC Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, as part of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) for southeast Louisiana. The project cost approximately $1.1 billion and was built at the confluence of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO). It is the largest design-build civil works project in the history of the Corps. It was first used in 2012 to protect against storm surge from Hurricane Isaac, and was fully completed in 2013.\n\nThe Mississippi River levees significantly limit the input of fresh water, sediment, and nutrients into the Pontchartrain basin. This reduction in freshwater input plays a role in the critical problem of the Pontchartrain Basin—increased salinity. The construction of the Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet Canal (MRGO), which breaches the natural barrier of the Bayou La Loutre ridge and the Borgne land bridge, has allowed sea water to push farther into the basin. Relative sea level rise of up to 0.96 feet per century also gives saltier waters greater access to surrounding wetlands. As a result, mean monthly salinities have increased since the construction of the MRGO and other canals. In recent years, salinities have stabilized. The heightened salinity has stressed wetlands, especially freshwater marshes and swamps.\n\nSince 1932, approximately 24% of the Borgne Land Bridge has been lost to severe shoreline retreat and rapid tidal fluctuations, and the loss rate is increasing. During the same time, 17% of the Maurepas Land Bridge marshes disappeared due to subsidence and spikes in lake salinity. These land bridges prevent estuarine processes, such as increased salinity and tidal scour, from pushing further into the middle and upper basins. Additionally, from 1968 to 1988, 32% of the cypress swamp on the land bridge had either converted to marsh or became open water. If these buffers are not preserved, the land loss rates around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas will increase dramatically.\n\nSeveral marshes in the basin are vulnerable to rapid loss if adequate protection is not quickly provided.\n"}

It honors Leif Erikson (Old Norse: \"Leifr Eiríksson\", , ), the Norse explorer who led the first Europeans thought to have set foot in continental North America (other than Greenland).\n\nThe 1874 book \"America Not Discovered by Columbus\" by Norwegian-American Rasmus B. Anderson helped popularize the idea that Vikings were the first Europeans in the New World, an idea that was all but verified in 1960. During his appearance at the Norse-American Centennial at the Minnesota State Fair in 1925, President Calvin Coolidge gave recognition to Leif Erikson as the discoverer of America due to research by Norwegian-American scholars such as Knut Gjerset and Ludvig Hektoen. In 1929, Wisconsin became the first U.S. state to officially adopt Leif Erikson Day as a state holiday, thanks in large part to efforts by Rasmus Anderson. In 1931, Minnesota did also. Thanks to the efforts of the Leif Erikson Memorial Association of Saskatchewan, the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan proclaimed—through an order-in-council in 1936—that Leif Ericsson Day would be observed on October 9. By 1956, Leif Erikson Day had been made an official observance in seven states (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois, Colorado, Washington, and California) and one Canadian province (Saskatchewan). \n\nIn 1963, Senator Hubert Humphrey and Representative John Blatnik, both from Minnesota, introduced bills to observe Leif Erikson Day nationwide. On September 2, 1964, Congress unanimously authorized and requested the President to create the observance through an annual proclamation. Lyndon B. Johnson did so that year, as has each president in the years since, often using the proclamation to praise the contributions of Americans of Nordic descent generally and the spirit of discovery.\n\nBills have been introduced in the Parliament of Canada to observe Leif Erikson Day.\n\nOctober 9 is not associated with any particular event in Leif Erikson's life. The date was chosen because the ship \"Restauration\" coming from Stavanger, Norway, arrived in New York Harbor on October 9, 1825, beginning a wave of immigration from Norway to America.\n\nIn addition to the federal observance, some U.S. states officially commemorate Leif Erikson Day. It is celebrated in many communities, particularly in the Upper Midwest and other places where large numbers of people from the Nordic countries settled. It has long been observed in Seattle, Washington. In 2012, the day was made official in Las Vegas, Nevada. Westby, Wisconsin and Norway, Michigan have held festivals near the day. There have been Canadian commemorations, including in Edmonton, Alberta and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The day is also celebrated in Iceland.\n"}

Following the publication of Cicely Mary Barker's original Flower Fairy paintings and verses, two series of fairy stories featuring original Flower Fairies characters, Flower Fairies Friends and, more recently, Secret Stories, have also been published.\nThe Flower Fairies were Cicely Mary Barker's most well-known creations. They are notable in particular because of the sweet, realistic depiction of the children, modelled on children enrolled in her sister Dorothy's kindergarten. She has also been likened to Beatrix Potter in the botanical accuracy of the plants and flowers amidst which the fairies dwell. The Flower Fairies and all related publications are licensed properties of Frederick Warne & Co and the Estate of Cicely Mary Barker.\n\nBelow are the eight original Flower Fairies books and the dates they were published by Cicely Mary Barker's original publisher, Blackie.\n\n\nThough first published in the first half of the century, Cicely Mary Barker's original eight volumes were re-launched in 2002 with slightly contemporary jackets, while maintaining their classic artwork.\n\nIn addition, Frederick Warne & Co has published the following compilations of Cicely Mary Barker's Flower Fairy artwork and poetry.\n\n\nFrederick Warne & Co have published two other series of fairy stories based on Cicely Mary Barker's original characters and incorporating her original artwork.\n\n\"Flower Fairies Friends\" are books for younger readers, each telling the story of a particular fairy and her friends, and were first published in 2003.\n\n\"Secret Stories\" is a new departure for the Flower Fairies. Introduced in 2006, they feature the characters of the \"Flower Fairies Friends\" books in chapter book length stories for 6-10 year olds.\n\nA new range of gift books was launched in 2005 with \"Flower Fairies Journal (Fairyopolis)\" and continue with \"How to Find Flower Fairies (2007)\", featuring ephemera such as postcards, mini-books and letters plus tabs, lenticulars and pop-ups. They explore the worlds of the author Cicely Mary Barker and the Flower Fairies in exquisite detail. A sequel to Fairyopolis has been released, entitled \"Return to Fairyopolis\".\n\nThe Flower Fairies are highly successful internationally and are sold in more than 35 countries. Flower Fairies merchandise includes items such as giftware, toiletries, cross stitch and stationery.\n\n"}

{"id": "2191307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191307", "title": "Local on the 8s", "text": "Local on the 8s\n\nLocal on the 8s (or the Local Forecast) is a program segment that airs on the American cable and satellite television network The Weather Channel. It provides viewers with information on current and forecasted weather conditions for their respective area; a version of this segment is also available on the channel's national satellite feed that features forecasts for each region of the United States. The name \"\"Local on the 8s\"\" comes from the timing of the segment, as airs at timeslots that end in \"8\" (examples: 9:18 and 12:48); because of this manner of scheduling, the forecast segments air on the channel in ten-minute intervals. From 2006-2013, each forecast segment has usually been preceded by a promo for one of The Weather Channel's programs or services, leading into the segment with the announcer stating \"And now, your \"Local on the 8s\"\". On November 12, 2013 the promo segment was replaced by an intro that was built into the \"Local on the 8s\" segment.\n\nThe Weather Channel has carried a local weather forecast segment since the network was launched on May 2, 1982. The segments were originally seen either every five minutes or eight times an hour at various times (airing more frequently in the morning and less frequently at night). The structure of scheduling the segments six times an hour at times ending in \"8\" was implemented in mid-1995. The \"Local on the 8s\" name was first used on April 21, 1996 to coincide with a sweeping revamp of the channel's on-air presentation; The Weather Channel filed for a trademark on the name on June 24, 1997. The name has caused confusion in the New York City market, as CBS Corporation's television and radio combination of WCBS-TV and WCBS (AM) use \"traffic and weather on the 8s\" to refer to the combined traffic and weather segments featured on those stations (which appear on WCBS-TV only during its morning newscasts and on WCBS radio at all hours).\n\nForecasts are generated by a WeatherStar machine, a proprietary hardware system in the form of a computerized unit that is installed in a headend at the facilities of local pay television providers that carry the channel. Weather information is received from the vertical blanking interval of the TWC video feed and from data transmitted via satellite, which is then sent to the WeatherStar unit that inserts the localized data over the TWC feed. The WeatherStar systems are capable of adding or removing segments shown within the main local forecast segment, with the common exception of the extended forecast; these customized segments are referred to as \"flavors,\" which allow variabilities in the weather graphics displayed during each local forecast segment, resulting in certain types of specialized weather data appearing only at specific times or lengths. , the length of these flavors is uniformally one minute; flavor lengths previously varied between 30 seconds and two minutes prior to April 2013 and extended flavors of three to six minutes were previously included between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s.\n\nDespite the name, the segment occasionally airs at times that do not end in \"8\" (such as 9:27, 9:57, 10:09, etc., usually no more than two minutes before the \"8\"s in an hour), particularly during original long-form programming and weekday morning forecast programs, such as \"AMHQ\" and the now-defunct \"Wake Up With Al\".\n\nThe majority of cable operators () use the IntelliStar, the sixth-generation and second-most recent STAR model, which was released in 2002. The IntelliStar platform can also generate graphics for Weatherscan, The Weather Channel's 24-hour localized weather network that is available on select cable and satellite systems. With an IntelliStar, in addition to current weather conditions for a given area, surrounding areas, and a specific region; 24- and 36-hour, daypart, and seven-day forecasts; and almanacs (products that are largely also available on older STAR systems that remain in use); cable viewers can also see air quality and health reports; specialized school day and activity forecasts; in coastal areas, tides and marine forecasts; and, in the past in certain large media markets, traffic conditions supplied by Traffic Pulse (which gathered the information in real time from intelligent transportation systems operated by state departments of transportation). The most recent STAR model, the IntelliStar 2, which was released in 2010 and is the seventh-generation model, generates weather data for The Weather Channel HD, the channel's high definition simulcast feed (the IntelliStar 2 is available in participating markets, with some cable and IPTV providers that use the SD-only IntelliStar system opting to transmit the national LDL/sidebar instead if the head-end does not have an IntelliStar 2 installed).\n\nBoth the IntelliStar and IntelliStar 2 (and from 2000 to late 2000s/early 2010s even for the WeatherSTAR XL) have an audio feature, known as Vocal Local – a function that assembles pre-recorded tracks for narration of the current temperature and sky conditions, descriptive forecasts and introductions to certain forecast products (the tracks are narrated by Allen Jackson and TWC meteorologist/storm tracker Jim Cantore for the respective systems). This function is similar to a narration feature in the WeatherSTAR 4000 that was used from 1990 to 1995; the narration, voiced by Dan Chandler, was used only to introduce products in the forecast segment.\n\nThe IntelliSTAR 2 and the IntelliSTAR 2 Jr are the only STAR models that are currently in operation.\n\nThree other STAR systems were used sporadically until June 2014: the WeatherSTAR 4000 is the oldest (having first been introduced in 1989/1990) and was the first in the series to be capable of producing graphical local forecasts and radar images. The Weather Star Jr. is a budget model introduced in 1994 that was very uncommon from its introduction, and is similar to the now-discontinued WeatherSTAR III (known as WeatherSTAR 3000) in terms of products and appearance, although it uses the typeface of the 4000.\n\nThe WeatherSTAR XL, introduced in the fall of 1998, is an IRIX-based machine, a major leap from the 4000 systems in terms of capabilities and graphic generation; it was used for Weatherscan until 2003 (the first use of the IntelliSTAR occurred that year on Weatherscan).\n\nAll STAR systems are capable of generating a crawl, which runs a series of scrolling text advertisements that appear at the bottom of the screen during each forecast segment.\n\nAs satellite television is broadcast to a large area, this localized weather model must be adapted for its viewers. The satellite forecast segment includes national weather headlines, daily forecasts and composite satellite/radar loops for the respective regions of the Northeastern, Southeastern, Central and Western United States. Until 2008, the satellite forecasts also featured four-day forecasts for 30 U.S. cities, regardless of region (similar to the former \"Travel Cities Forecast\" product used by STAR models from the WeatherStar 4000 and earlier).\n\nIntelliSTARs are installed at the primary uplink sites respectively used by DirecTV and Dish Network, but they run a different lower display line graphic and sidebar (the latter is seen only on the channel's HD feed) at all times even during commercial breaks. This cycles through current conditions (only denoting the sky condition, temperature, wind data and if applicable, apparent temperature) and daypart forecasts for major U.S. cities. The current time, based on time zone, and a news ticker displaying weather-related headlines appear above the LDL (while the IntelliSTAR models key the local time over the national LDL's time bar, the ticker, as with the segment rundown in the upper portion of the sidebar, is visible to all viewers).\n\nOn November 8, 2006, Dish Network viewers began to be able to view local weather conditions and radar on The Weather Channel on DISH HOME Channel 100, based on their billing ZIP code, along with access to weather information in other cities. DirecTV viewers can receive local forecasts by ZIP code, which works through the \"interactive\" function of later receiver models (this function was temporarily suspended on January 14, 2014 due to the channel's carriage dispute with the satellite provider, and was restored when the channel was restored in April 2014 following the reach of a new carriage agreement).\n\nAlthough IPTV services are wired services (in a similar vein to cable television systems), allowing for the use of WeatherStar systems, AT&T U-verse also does not provide localized forecasts through the aid of an IntelliStar computer (AT&T U-verse does provide a dedicated Weather on Demand channel with forecasts provided by AccuWeather); as such, U-verse subscribers also see the satellite forecast segment during the \"Local on the 8s\" segments.\n\nDuring The Weather Channel's \"Storm Alert\" mode (which was introduced in 2005), specifically when a dangerous hurricane prepares to make landfall, the number of local forecasts seen throughout each hour is reduced from six times to four – :18, :28, :48 and :58 past the hour.\n\nThe Weather Star systems also utilize weather information in the form of a Lower Display Line (LDL); the LDL displayed by Weather Star systems from Weather Star Jr. and earlier were strictly text-based, and therefore contained no graphical background, and also only included current weather observations and monthly precipitation totals.\n\nThe Weather Star XL included a semi-translucent background for the LDL and added local weather forecasts, while the IntelliStar system includes current conditions and forecasts for four (originally, three) nearby areas and until March 11, 2010, included air quality indexes, travel forecasts for three cities in the region, traffic information and almanac data.\n\nTime data was included on the LDLs as well as the full-screen local forecast graphics since the initial Weather Star system (this function was dropped on March 11, 2010 on the IntelliSTAR, though it returned to the LDL six days later on March 16) and the current date was also included on systems from Weather Star XL and earlier.\n\nWith the addition of a national LDL during national programming on March 11, 2010, cable headends still using the Weather Star 4000 and Weather Star Jr. now overlay the text-only LDL over the national LDL due to the lack of a background on the 4000 and Jr.'s LDLs; the XL's LDL stopped receiving a signal to cue as well after this update. However, on extreme, rare conditions, the 4000 and/or Jr.'s LDLs will cue and remain on for a period during the day it gets cued.\n\nIn recent years with the inclusion of original programming such as \"Storm Stories\" and \"Full Force Nature\" to The Weather Channel, the local forecasts began airing only for four times an hour during long-form entertainment-based programs and some forecast programming on the channel. Local weather information was provided during the other \"8\"s on the Lower Display Line during these programs. The standard \"Local on the 8s\" segment airs during non-forecast programming once every half-hour; until November 11, 2013, at about :18 and :48 minutes of each hour, an L-bar displaying localized weather observations and forecasts aired during a live national forecast update performed by one of the channel's on-camera meteorologists, running in a simultaneous picture-in-picture format. On November 12, 2013, The Weather Channel began to display the Lower Display Line full-time, throughout commercial breaks and telecasts of its long-form programs (prior to the change, commercials were broadcast full-screen and the LDL appeared during long-form programs on an intermittent basis).\n\nThe graphical revamp resulted in other changes to the on-air display; the LDL was replaced on the \"Local on the 8s\" segments by a combined segment rundown/progress bar display, with time data being moved to an upper-third graphic. A sidebar was introduced, appearing on the right third of the screen (outside of the 4:3 safe area for standard definition viewers) on The Weather Channel HD, which unlike the LDL, is removed during commercial breaks and is only shown during the channel's forecast programming; the satellite version of the sidebar displays major airport delays, temperature and precipitation extremes for the current or previous day around the U.S., snowfall reports for major ski resorts (during the winter months only), as well as a rundown of the segments within the program (at the top of the screen) and weather information to be featured in the center portion of the sidebar (at the bottom-right corner, which is covered by the supplementary localized weather data on providers using the IntelliStar 2). For cable and IPTV subscribers, the IntelliStar 2 generates arrival and departure delays for area airports; visibility, dew point and barometric pressure data not included within the current observations featured on the LDL; almanac data (showing average and record minimum and maximum temperatures; sunrise and sunset, and in coastal areas, high and low tide times; and moon phase data for the current date); and air quality forecasts on the center of the sidebar.\n\nPop and smooth jazz music is regularly played during the \"Local on the 8s\" segments; the music that is heard over the national feed's forecast segments is also transmitted over the localized segments generated by the STAR headend units. The Weather Channel released its own Smooth Jazz CD in 2007, \"\", based on collections of popular music played during the \"Local On the 8s\" segments. It peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top Contemporary Jazz charts that year. Artists included on this CD are Joyce Cooling, Dave Koz, Paprika Soul, Four 80 East, Jeff Lorber, Pieces of a Dream, Chick Corea, Jeanne Ricks, Ryan Farish, Mark Krurnowski, Najee and 3rd Force. In 2008, a second compilation CD containing the channel's most requested music was released, titled \"\". Artists on this CD include Russ Freeman & The Rippingtons, Jeff Lorber, Ramsey Lewis Trio, Bradley Joseph, Bernie Williams, David Benoit, Spyro Gyra, Norman Brown, Chris Geith, Joe Sample, Charlie Parker Quartet and Eric Marienthal.\n\nOther songs that can be heard during this segment include production music from the Network Music stock music service, and music from artists such as Trammell Starks (who composed 40 tracks specifically for The Weather Channel), The Rippingtons, Moby, EKO, Pat Metheny Group, Shadowfax, Roberto Tola, Chris Camozzi, Scott Ward, Miles Davis, Robert A. Wolf, David Becker and Kent Marcum. Instrumentals performed by bands such as The B-52's (\"Follow Your Bliss\"), Derek and the Dominos (the \"Layla\" piano exit), Devo (\"Gut Feeling\"), The Who (the beginning intro of \"Eminence Front\"), the Allman Brothers Band (\"Jessica\"), parts of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", \"Terminal Frost\" and Run Like Hell by Pink Floyd, and \"Divided Sky\" by Phish have also been heard during this segment. When \"Wake Up With Al\" premiered in July 2009, music from 3 Doors Down including \"Here Without You\" was added to the lineup, marking the first time the broadcast played music that contained lyrics. Most recently, much of the solo piano music was provided by new age pianist, Matthew C. Shuman, with his original pieces (\"Chasing the Wind\", \"Stormy Sea\", \"Finding Freedom\", \"Frosty Sunrise\", \"Fallen Snow\", \"Falling Rain\", \"Night Storm\", \"Mixed Emotions\", \"White Water\", \"Running Out of Time\", \"Ocean Journey\" and \"Into the East\").\n\nOther songs containing lyrics from artists such as Taylor Swift and Vanessa Carlton have been rotated into the local forecast cycle since then, though the inclusion of lyrical songs poses a problem as the ducking feature of the IntelliStar's Vocal Local function causes both the music and lyrics to be nearly muted (this is not the case with the IntelliStar 2) as the narration track is played in a nearly continuous manner until the end of the 24- to 48-hour forecast segment. This is in addition to the fact that the songs will not be played in their entirety due to the variable and often limited local forecast lengths.\n\nThe Weather Channel suspends the music playlist regularly used during the forecast segments at other times (which is rotated on a seasonal basis) when a tropical storm or hurricane approaches coastal areas of the United States, during which time it is substituted with the \"Storm Alert\" music. During the holiday season, the normal music is replaced with appropriately-themed music such as instrumental versions of popular Christmas carols and music from \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" is often played during the \"Local on the 8s\". Music and scores from various films including \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Jurassic Park\", \"Harry Potter\", \"Home Alone\", \"Shaft\", \"St. Elmo's Fire\", and \"\" have also been played. On July 7, 2009, into the early morning of July 8, The Weather Channel played the hit Michael Jackson song \"Billie Jean\", to commemorate the memorial service held in honor of Jackson that day in Los Angeles, two weeks after his June 25 death. It was also played during the \"Wake Up with Al\" playlists in the months that followed.\n\nSince November 12, 2013, the new music package introduced to The Weather Channel on that day also began to be played during the local forecasts, replacing the other music. Three songs from that package are being used for the local forecasts, with a fourth being used during the segments when the channel's \"Red Alert\" mode (which replaced the \"Storm Alert\" mode in 2012) is ongoing, which also suspends all music during very frequent weather situations. It also used vocal music from February to May 2014 along with the music package. In September 2014, a new song was added to the package; with seven more songs added in November 2014. The channel returned Christmas songs in December 2014. Smooth jazz music returned in 2016 on pre-determined days, usually four or five days per month. In September 2016, four new Storm Alert songs were added during coverage of Hurricane Hermine, replacing the one used since 2013. However, the original track returned during coverage of Hurricane Matthew and subsequent events (including Winter Storm Jupiter and the tornado outbreak of January 21–23, 2017) the following month. In March 2017, during coverage of Winter Storm Stella, another new storm alert theme was added. On July 4, 2017, and again on August 18, 2017, Weezer's newest song \"Feels Like Summer\" was played. On the day of the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, music containing the words \"sun\", \"sunshine\" or \"eclipse\" in the songs' title were played, including \"Ain't No Sunshine\", \"Walking on the Sun\", \"Let the Sunshine In\"; \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\" by Stevie Wonder, \"Here Comes the Sun\" by the Beatles, and \"Eclipse\" by Pink Floyd. Three new songs from Extreme Music were added to the package in August 2018.\n\n\n"}

It replaced the Corona and Carina wagons, and was sold at both \"Toyota Store\" and \"Toyopet Store\" locations in Japan.\n\nWhile the Caldina has never been officially exported by Toyota outside Japan, its All-Trac 4WD capability and large capacity have made it a popular grey import in Australia, New Zealand, Russia and many South American countries.\n\nThe Caldina was discontinued in 2007, with the T270 series Avensis wagon/estate assuming the market position previously held by the Caldina.\n\nAccording to Toyota, the name \"Caldina\" is inspired by the Italian (and English) adjective \"cardinal\", meaning \"essential\" or \"fundamental\".\n\nThe first generation Caldina is a 5-door wagon and commercial van version (1992–2002) of the Corona/Carina sedan in Japan. The wagon has independent strut rear suspension while the commercial wagon has semi-independent leaf springs.\n\nThe second generation Caldina is the Japanese version of the European Avensis wagon, launched in Japan in 1997.\n\nThe four-wheel drive models are coded ST215, and were also offered as Active Sports GT models with the \"3S-GE\" engine. The top-of-the-line GT-T came with the turbocharged fourth generation \"3S-GTE\" engine, and included a four-wheel drive system similar to the Celica GT-Four. The GT-T also came with optional electronic stability control (standard on Active Sports versions). The Aerial version features a large sunroof and contoured roof racks as standard. Weighing , the manual Caldina GT-T has a time of 6.4 seconds, with the automatic version only 0.1 seconds slower. A refresh was given in 2000 with new plastic bumpers and plastic headlights. The mostly-plastic interior was also updated. In 2001, an extra lug was added to the turbo manifold to prevent the manifold from warping which had been a common issue on GT-T models. Reliability of the GT-T engines proved to be a concern throughout the lifespan of the \"3S\" powered GT-Ts, with spun main bearings and shattered oil pump gears being common issues amongst owners.\n\nEngines for lesser models are the 1.8 L \"7A-FE\" petrol, the 2.0 L \"3S-FE\" petrol and the 2.2 L \"3C-TE\" diesel. Reliability and maintenance issues combined with relative obscurity, hampered perceived resale values of the GT-T in countries outside Japan, making the GT-T a very cheap people carrier in grey markets like Australia.\n\nThe third generation Caldina launched in September 2002 is a pure sports wagon and does not share body panels with Allion, Premio and Avensis.\nEngines for the Caldina are 1.8 L \"1ZZ-FE\", 2.0 L \"1AZ-FSE\" and 2.0 L turbocharged \"3S-GTE\". Trim levels are 1.8 X, 1.8 Z, 2.0 Z, 2.0 ZT and GT-Four (the latter is coded ST246). All models have an automatic transmission and the GT-Four model only comes in a tiptronic transmission.\n\nAs a tribute to Toyota's motorsports development guru and the creator of the first GT-Four, Hiromu Naruse, a special edition Caldina GT-Four was produced, the Caldina GT-Four \"N\" edition (N for Naruse). This model was equipped with several performance enhancements specified by Naruse:\n\nProduction of the third generation Caldina ended in mid-2007 without a direct successor, but is indirectly replaced with the T270 series Avensis wagon/estate imported from UK.\n"}

Its closest relative is \"Rhododendron vaseyi\" from the Appalachian Mountains, which differs in having seven stamens. DNA sequencing shows that \"R. vaseyi\" is not related to \"R. canadense\", but more to \"R. albrechtii\".\n\nIt reaches a mature height of 0.5–1.2 m (approximately 1–3 feet). In early spring, it produces pinkish-purple flowers in clusters of 2–6 together; each flower is 2–3 cm (approximately 1 inch) in diameter, with a five-lobed purple corolla. The flowers are unusual in comparison with other species of the genus \"Rhododendron\" found in northeastern North America. Most rhododendrons of the region have tubular flowers with 5 stamens each, while \"R. canadense\" has 10 stamens housed inside a zygomorphic corolla. The leaves open only after the flowers have bloomed and wilted; they are narrow oval, 2–6 cm long and 1–2 cm broad. When not in flower, it can still be identified by its peculiar, orange-brown seed cases, 1–1.2 cm long.\n\nThe wild distribution of the rhodora begins at its easternmost extreme in Canada in Newfoundland and extends into eastern Ontario and the United States, where it has its most famous home in New England and also occurs naturally in New York, New Jersey, and at high altitudes in the Appalachian Mountains further south to Pennsylvania. It thrives in the moist, acidic soils of bogs, swamps, and clearings in woodlands.\n\nFor a long time, the species was regarded as a botanical icon of New England. The Transcendentalist writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, who spent his life in Concord, Massachusetts, paid homage to it in his poem \"The Rhodora: On Being Asked Whence Is the Flower\" (1834, pub. 1847). In this reflective lyric, the poet arrives at the epiphany that the beauty of the rhodora exists not only for its own sake but also discloses the mystical unity of all creation under God. The poet embraces this unity in his parting words to the rhodora: \"The self-same Power that brought me there brought you\". The composer Mary Lynn Lightfoot later set the poem to music in a song of the same name for a women's choir.\n\n\"Rhodora\" is also the name of the journal of the Harvard-affiliated New England Botanical Club, which is a peer reviewed scientific publication dedicated to the flora of North America.\n\n"}

{"id": "2191347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191347", "title": "Mobile content", "text": "Mobile content\n\nMobile content is any type of electronic media which is viewed or used on mobile phones, like ringtones, graphics, discount offers, games, movies, and GPS navigation. As mobile phone use has grown since the mid-1990s, the significance of the devices in everyday life has grown accordingly. Owners of mobile phones can now use their devices to make calendar appointments, send and receive text messages (SMS), listen to music, watch videos, shoot videos, redeem coupons for purchases, view office documents, get driving instructions on a map, and so forth. The use of mobile content has grown accordingly.\n\nCamera phones not only present but produce media, for example photographs with a few million pixels, and can act as pocket video cameras.\n\nMobile content can also refer to text or multimedia hosted on websites, which may either be standard Internet pages, or else specific mobile pages.\n\nMobile content via SMS is still the main technology for communication used to send mobile consumers messages, especially simple content such as ringtones and wallpapers. Because SMS is the main messaging technology used by young people, it is still the most effective way of reaching this target market. SMS is also ubiquitous, reaching a wider audience than any other technology available in the mobile space (MMS, bluetooth, mobile e-mail or WAP). More important than anything else, SMS is extremely easy to use, which makes adoption increase day by day.\n\nAlthough SMS is an old technology that may someday be replaced by the likes of Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) or WAP, SMS frequently gains new powers. One example is the introduction of applications whereby mobile tickets are sent to consumers via SMS, which contains a WAP-push that contains a link where a barcode is placed. This clearly substitutes MMS, which has a limited reach and still suffers from interoperability problems.\n\nIt is important to keep enhancing the consumer confidence in using SMS for mobile content applications. This means, if a consumer has ordered a new wallpaper or ringtone, this has to work properly, in a speedy and reliable way. Therefore, it is important to choose the right SMS gateway provider in order to ensure quality-of-service along the whole path of the content SMS until reaching the consumer's mobile.\n\nModern phones come with Bluetooth and Near field communication. This allows video to be sent from phone to phone over Bluetooth, which has the advantages that there is no data charge.\n\nMobile application development, also known as mobile apps, has become a significant mobile content market since the release of the first iPhone from Apple in 2007. Prior to the release of Apple's phone product, the market for mobile applications (outside of games) had been quite limited. The bundling of the iPhone with an app store, as well as the iPhone's unique design and user interface, helped bring a large surge in mobile application use. It also enabled additional competition from other players. For example, Google's Android platform for mobile content has further increased the amount of app content available to mobile phone subscribers.\n\nSome examples of mobile apps would be applications to manage travel schedules, buy movie tickets, preview video content, manage RSS news feeds, read digital version of popular newspapers, identify music, look at star constellations, view Wikipedia, and much more. Many television networks have their own app to promote and present their content. iTyphoon is an example of a mobile application used to provide information about typhoons in the Philippines.\n\nMobile games are applications that allow people to play a game on a mobile handset. The main categories of mobile games include Puzzle/Strategy, Retro/Arcade, Action/Adventure, Card/Casino, Trivia/Word, Sports/Racing, given in approximate order of their popularity.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that the majority of mobile games are bought and played by women. Sixty-five percent of mobile game revenue is driven by female wireless subscribers. They are the biggest driver of revenue for the Puzzle/Strategy category; comprising 72 percent of the total share of revenue, while men made up 28 percent (see Table 2). Women dominate revenue generation for all mobile game categories, with the exception of Action/Adventure mobile games, in which men drive 60 percent of the revenue for that category. It's also said that teens are three times as likely as those over twenty to play cell phone games.\n\nMobile images are used as the wallpaper to a mobile phone, and are also available as screensavers. On some handsets, images can also be set to display when a particular person calls the users. Sites like adg.ms allow users to download free content, however service operators such as Telus Mobility blocks non Telus website downloads.\n\nMobile music is any audio file that is played on a mobile phone. Mobile music is normally formatted as an AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) file or an MP3, and comes in several different formats. Monophonic ringtones were the earliest form of ringtone, and played one tone at a time. This was improved upon with polyphonic ringtones, which played several tones at the same time so a more convincing melody could be created. The next step was to play clips of actual songs, which were dubbed Realtones. These are preferred by record labels as this evolution of the ringtone has allowed them to gain a cut of lucurative ringtone market. In short Realtones generate royalties for record labels (the master recording owners) as well as publishers (the writers), however, when Monophonic or Polyphonic ringtones are sold only publishing or \"mechanical\" royalties are incurred as no master recording has been exploited. Some companies promote covertones, which are ringtones that are recorded by cover bands to sound like a famous song. Recently Ringback tones have become available, which are played to the person calling the owner of the ringback tone. Voicetones are ringtones that play someone talking or shouting rather than music, and there are various of ringtones of natural and everyday sounds. Realtones are the most popular form of ringtones. As an example, they captures 76.4% of the US ringtone market in the second quarter of 2006, followed by monophonic and polyphonic ringtones at 12% and ringback tones and 11.5% – but monophonic and polyphonic ringtones are falling in popularity while ringback tones are growing. This trend is common around the globe. A recent innovation is the singtone, whereby \"the user’s voice is recorded singing to a popular music track and then “tuned-up” automatically to sound good. This can then be downloaded as a ringtone or sent to another user's mobile phone\" said the director of Synchro Arts, the developers.\n\nAs well as mobile music there are full track downloads, which are an entire song encoded to play on a mobile phone. These can be purchased and bought over the mobile network, but data charges can make this prohibitive. The other way to get a song onto a mobile phone is by \"side loading\" it, which normally involves downloading the song onto a computer and then transferring it to the mobile phone via Bluetooth, infra-red or cable connections. It is possible to use a full track as a ringtone. In recent years, websites have sprung that allow users to upload audio files and customize them into ringtones using specialized applications, including Myxer, MobilesRingtones, Bongotones, Ringtoneslab and Zedge.\n\nMobile music is becoming an integral part of the music industry as a whole. In 2005, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI) said it expects mobile music to generate more revenues that online music before the end of that year. In the first half of 2005, the digital music market grew enough to offset the fall in the traditional music market – without including the sale of ringtones, which still makes up the majority of mobile music sales around the globe.\n\nMobile video comes in several forms including 3GPP, MPEG-4, RTSP, and Flash Lite.\n\nA Mobishow or a cellsode are terms to describe a broadcast quality programme / series which has been produced, directed, edited and encoded for the mobile phone. Mobishows and Cellsodes can range from short video clips such as betting advice or the latest celebrity gossip, through to half-hour drama serials. Examples include \"The Ashes\" and \"Mr Paparazzi Show\" which both were created for mobile viewing.\n\nMobile streaming radio is an application that streams on-demand audio channels or live radio stations to the mobile phone. In the U.S., mSpot was the first company to develop and commercialize streaming radio which went live in March 2005 on Sprint. Today, all major carriers offer some sort streaming radio service featuring programmed stations based on popular genres and live stations which included both music and talk.\n\nMobile video also comes in the form of streaming TV over the mobile network, which must be a 2.5G or 3G network. This mimics a television station in that the user cannot elect to see what they wish but must watch whatever is on the channel at the time.\n\nThere is also mobile broadcast TV, which operates like a traditional television station and broadcasts the content over a different spectrum. This frees up the mobile network to handle calls and other data usage, and because of the \"one-to-many\" nature of mobile broadcast TV the video quality is a lot better than that streamed over the mobile networks, which is a \"one-to-one\" system.\n\nThe problem is that broadcast technologies don't have a natural up link, so for users to interact with the TV stream the service has to be closely integrated to the carriers mobile network. The main technologies for broadcast TV are DVB-H, Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), and MediaFLO.\n\nLive video can also be streamed and shared from a cell phone through applications like Qik and InstaLively. The uploaded video can be shared to friends through emails or social networking sites. Most Live video streaming application works over the cell network or through Wi-Fi. They also require most users to have a dataplan from their cell phone carriers.\n\nSince the late 1990s, mobile content has become an increasingly important market worldwide. The South Koreans are the world leaders in Mobile Content and 3-G mobile networks, then the Japanese, followed closely by the Europeans, are heavy users of their mobile phones and have been attaining custom mobile content for their devices for years. In fact, mobile phone use has begun to exceed the use of PCs in some countries. In the United States and Canada, mobile phone use and the accompanying use of mobile content has been slower to gain traction because of political issues and because open networks do not exist in America.\n\nOn current trends, mobile phone content will play an increasing role in the lives of millions across the globe in the years ahead, as users will depend on their mobile phones to keep in touch not only with their friends but with world news, sports scores, the latest movies and music, and more.\n\nMobile content is usually downloaded through WAP sites, but new methods are on the rise. In Italy, 800,000 people are registered users to Passa Parola, an application that allows users to browse a big database for mobile content and directly download it to their handsets. This tool can also be used to recommend content to others, or send content as a gift.\n\nAn increasing number of people are also beginning to use applications like Qik to upload and share their videos from their cell phone to the internet. Mobile phone software like Qik allows user to share their videos to their friends through emails, SMS, and even social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook.\n\nA 2016 Pew Research report \"The Modem News Consumer\" said 70 percent of those ages 18–29 preferred getting news from mobile devices rather than desktops, while the number was 53 percent for persons 30 to 49.\n\n"}

A shrug is an emblem, meaning that it integrates the vocabulary of only certain cultures and may be used in place of words. It can also be used when simply ignoring a question. It may be accentuated with raised eyebrows, a turned-down mouth, an exaggerated frown, and raised palms. It is very common in Western culture—rather than saying \"I don't know\", one may simply perform a shrug.. In the English-speaking world it may be accompanied by a three-syllable grunt or hummed mumble mimicking the intonation of \"I don't know\" (low-high-low).\n\nShoulder shrugs are among the symptomatic tics of Tourette syndrome.\n\nThe shrug gesture is a Unicode emoji included as .\nThe shrug emoticon, made from Unicode characters, is also typed as ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ .\n\n"}
{"id": "2191357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191357", "title": "Chinese numerology", "text": "Chinese numerology\n\nIn Chinese tradition, certain numbers are believed by some to be auspicious (吉利, ) or inauspicious (不吉, ) based on the Chinese word that the number sounds similar to. The numbers 6, 8, and 9 are generally considered to be auspicious, while 4 and 7 are considered inauspicious.\n\nThe number 0 (零, ) is the beginning of all things \n\nThe number 1 (一, ) is neither auspicious nor inauspicious. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. But it can also symbolize loneliness or being single. For example: November 11th is the Singles' Day in China, as the date has four ‘1’ which stand for singles.\n\nThe number 2 (二 or 兩, ) is most often considered a good number in Chinese culture. There is a Chinese saying: \"good things come in pairs\". It is common to repeat characters in product brand names, such as the character 喜 (), can be repeated to form the character 囍 (). \nIn Cantonese, 2 (二 or 兩, ) is homophone with the characters for \"easy\" (易, ) and \"bright\" (亮, ). \n\nThe number 3 (三, ) sounds like 生 (), which means \"to live\" or \"life\" so it's considered a good number. It's significant since it is one of three important stages in a person’s life (birth, marriage, and death).<br>On the other hand, number 3 (三,) sounds like 散 () which means \"to split\" or \"to separate\" or \"to part ways\" or \"to break up with\" so it's a bad number too.\n\nThe number 4 (四, ) is considered an unlucky number in Chinese because it is nearly homophonous to the word \"death\" (死 ). \nThus, some buildings in East Asia omit floors and room numbers containing 4, similar to the Western practice of some buildings not having a 13th floor because 13 is considered unlucky. \nWhere East Asian and Western cultures blend, such as in Hong Kong, it is possible in some buildings that the thirteenth floor along with all the floors with 4s to be omitted. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would in fact have just eighty one floors.\n\nThe number 5 (五, ) sounds like \"me\" in Mandarin (吾, ) and Cantonese (唔, ). \nFive is also associated with the five elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Metal) in Chinese philosophy, and in turn was historically associated with the Emperor of China. For example, the Tiananmen gate, being the main thoroughfare to the Forbidden City, has five arches.\n\nThe number 6 (六, ) in Mandarin sounds like \"slick\" or \"smooth\" (溜, ). In Cantonese, 6 () sounds like \"good fortune\" or \"happiness\" (祿, 樂 ).\nTherefore six is considered a good number for business.\n\nThe number 7 (七, ) in Mandarin sounds like \"even\" in Mandarin (齊, ), so it is a good number for relationships. It also sounds like \"arise\" (起, ) and \"life essence\" (氣, ) in Mandarin.\nSeven can also be considered an unlucky number since the 7th month (July) is a \"ghost month\". It also sounds like \"to deceive\" (欺, ) in Mandarin.\nIn Cantonese, 7 () sounds like 𨳍 (), which is a vulgar way of saying \"penis\".\n\nThe number 8 (八, ) sounds like \"發\" ().\nThere is also a visual resemblance between 88 and 囍 (), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters 喜 ().\n\nThe number 8 is viewed as such an auspicious number that even being assigned a number with several eights is considered very lucky.\n\nThe number 9 (九, ) was historically associated with the Emperor of China, and the number was frequently used in matters relating to the Emperor, before the establishment of the imperial examinations officials were organized in the nine-rank system, the nine bestowments were rewards the Emperor made for officials of extraordinary capacity and loyalty, while the nine familial exterminations was one of the harshest punishments the Emperor sentenced; the Emperor's robes often had nine dragons, and Chinese mythology held that the dragon has nine children.\nAlso, the number 9 sounds like \"long lasting\" (久, ), so it is often used in weddings.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of these interludes range from ten seconds to a minute in length (with the exception of \"vi. Drifting Patterns\" which is over two and a half minutes long). The result length is 27 minutes.\n\nCritical response to the album was varied. A common criticism was that the album contained too many interludes. (In fact, there are more musical interludes on the album than there are songs.) Pitchfork Media, for instance, stated that many of these interludes were \"annoying\" . \n\nThe psychedelic production of the album led critics to make comparisons to popular albums by The Beatles and The Beach Boys.\n\nAll tracks written by Robert Schneider except where noted.\n\n\nThe Australian and Japanese versions of \"Her Wallpaper Reverie\" contain five bonus tracks.

{"id": "2191363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191363", "title": "WPFO", "text": "WPFO\n\nWPFO, virtual channel 23 (UHF digital channel 17), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Waterville, Maine, United States and serving the Portland, Maine television market, including southern Maine and eastern and northern New Hampshire. The station is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting; the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns Portland-licensed CBS affiliate WGME-TV (channel 13), operates WPFO under a local marketing agreement (LMA). However, Sinclair effectively owns WPFO as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Northport Drive in the North Deering section of Portland and transmitter facilities on Brown Hill west of Raymond.\n\nThe station began broadcasting on August 27, 1999 as WMPX-TV and was a Pax TV (now Ion Television) affiliate owned by Paxson Communications (now Ion Media Networks). In addition to Pax programming, WMPX carried a small amount of local programming and in 2001, the station began airing rebroadcasts of NBC affiliate WCSH (channel 6)'s 11 p.m. newscasts when NBC had a partnership with Pax. Paxson sold the station in December 2002 to Corporate Media Consultants Group who changed the call sign to the current WPFO. The new calls reflected an affiliation change to Fox, which took place in April 2003, filling a gap created in fall 2001 when WPXT (channel 51) switched to The WB. In the interim, prime time and children's programming from the Fox network was provided exclusively on WFXT (which was owned by the network at the time) for those living on the New Hampshire side of the market, and on Foxnet for cable subscribers throughout the entire state of Maine; WCKD-LP served as a secondary affiliate of Fox during that time, but only carried the network's sports programming. In July 2007, WPFO debuted a new logo and updated website. The website's design was outsourced to Fox Interactive Media which also develops websites for Fox's owned-and-operated stations. WPFO switched website providers to Broadcast Interactive Media in March 2010. Currently WPFO's website provider is Sinclair Interactive Media.\n\nAs WPFO, in addition to Fox prime time, sports and syndicated programming, the station produces and airs local paid programming under the titles \"Fox 23 Lifestyle\" and \"Your Hometown\". It was announced by the Maine Lottery on April 16, 2010, that starting May 11, WPFO would begin airing the Mega Millions lottery drawings Tuesday and Friday nights at 11 following the hour long 10 o'clock newscast. Maine joined the Mega Millions lottery on May 9 starting ticket sales on that date.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the non-license assets of WPFO from Corporate Media Consultants Group for $13.6 million; the deal made it a sister station to WGME-TV, which already produced newscasts for the station. On November 20, it was announced that Cunningham Broadcasting will acquire the license assets for $3.4 million. The sale of the license assets was approved on June 23, 2017. The sale was completed on August 1.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nSyndicated programming on WPFO includes \"Maury\", \"Hot Bench\", \"The Doctors\", \"Family Feud\", and \"The Big Bang Theory\".\n\nFor a time in the early-2000s, WMPX re-aired some newscasts from WCSH and WLBZ as part of a larger deal between Paxson Communications and Gannett. This station also operated from WCSH's Downtown Portland studios at Congress Square and sold air time jointly with WCSH and WLBZ under a time brokerage agreement. In 2003, a three-hour-long weekday morning talk show with a call-in format called \"So Goes the Nation\" began airing. It was hosted by Alan Silberberg and former WVOM host Charlie Horne from the studios of Bangor's Fox affiliate WFVX-LP. Originally seen only on WFVX, simulcasts were later added on WPFO and area radio station WLOB. \"So Goes the Nation\" was canceled in September 2004.\n\nFrom November 9, 2005 until March 27, 2009, WPFO simulcasted WLOB's weekday morning show under the branding \"The Fox Morning News\" hosted by Ray Richardson and Ted Talbot. There were short features and news stories from Fox News Channel and weather forecasts with former WGME-TV meteorologist Paul Cousins during breaks in the show. Appropriately for WLOB's conservative talk format, it also featured live call-ins from viewers and listeners. On March 30, 2009, it was replaced by the nationally syndicated morning show \"The Daily Buzz\". WLOB's program moved to MNTV affiliate WPME as \"The Ray Richardson Show\" and aired from 6:30 to 7:30 until June, 2013.\n\nOn February 5, 2007, WGME began producing a nightly 10 o'clock newscast on WPFO called \"News 13 on Fox\" after a news share agreement was established between the two. It is aired from a secondary set at WGME's studios on the corner of Washington Avenue and Northport Drive in the North Deering section of Portland. Starting April 5, 2010, the Sunday-Friday 10 o'clock broadcast was expanded to an hour. The newscast features national content from CBS, CNN, and Sinclair. The newscast was renamed \"Fox 23 News at Ten\" on January 30, 2014.\n\nA morning show was launched on WPFO called \"Good Day Maine\" also produced by WGME. It is a talk, entertainment, news, weather, and sports program that airs from 7 to 8. The show is the only local morning broadcast during the time slot and competes against \"CBS This Morning\" (on WGME), \"Good Morning America\" (on WMTW), and \"Today\" (on WCSH). This newscast airs from the secondary set at WGME's facilities (which received an update) along with a new secondary weather set (while also using the main weather center outside of WGME's \"CBS This Morning\" cut-ins) to deliver weather reports. There is also a live interview desk that was previously used on WGME during news headline updates on that station's weekday morning show and a new light story room which includes a nighttime backdrop of the Portland skyline along with several couches and armchairs. WPFO's website hosted video from both of the WGME-produced newscasts through April 2013; subsequently viewers were directed to a third-party website where individual segments could be purchased for a fee. Launched as a two-hour broadcast, \"Good Day Maine\" was shortened to one hour by October 2013 before returning to the two-hour format on September 30, 2019.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, WPFO launched \"Fox 23 News at 6:30\", a half-hour weekday newscast scheduled directly against the evening news on the Big Three television networks. It was cancelled on December 23, 2016; \"Seinfeld\" reruns began airing in the time slot on December 26.\n\nAll WGME-produced newscasts on WPFO were made available in high definition format starting on February 8, 2012; the newscasts are presented in widescreen (letterboxed) format on WPFO's standard definition feed.\n\n10 p.m. newscasts that start late due to sports overruns or other special programming are typically recorded in advance and most often a half-hour in length even on those days when a typical 10 p.m. newscast would be an hour.\n\n"}
{"id": "2191365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191365", "title": "Kearney, Ontario", "text": "Kearney, Ontario\n\nKearney is a town and municipality in the Almaguin Highlands region of Parry Sound District of Ontario, Canada. With a landmass of 531 square kilometres and a year-round population of 882 in the Canada 2016 Census, Kearney claims to be the \"Biggest Little Town in Ontario.\"\n\nPerry Township was opened to settlement in 1873 and the first two Post Offices in the township were established at Scotia and Emsdale, on the Muskoka Road. In 1879, in the north-east corner of the township, settlers Arthur J. O'Neil and his partner William Kearney opened a store on the 12th Concession, near what is now Cherry Hill Road, (west of Beaver Lake). In the following year a post office was opened in \"Kearney Store\" and inherited the name. In those days the closest railway was the Northern at Gravenhurst from which all supplies were brought up the Muskoka Road.\n\nKearney prospered as a logging town with many sawmills and lumber camps. The logs were floated down the Magnetawan River, some as far as Byng Inlet.\n\nWith the arrival of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway in 1895, a siding was built at the foot of what was known as Long Lake (now Perry Lake). The commerce of the village shifted to the east side of the lake, near the railway station, where logs would be loaded onto the train after only a few days drive. In 1908, Kearney separated from the township of Perry, and it was incorporated as a town. The original parcel of land included 600 acres (2.4 km²).\n\nThe Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway was absorbed into the Canada Atlantic Railway, which was sold to the Grand Trunk Railway in 1905. In 1923 the Grand Trunk became part of the Canadian National Railways. The track from Kearney into Algonquin Park was abandoned in 1959. The rail bed was converted into a road to allow continued access to the now ghost towns of Ryan and Ravensworth, and Rain Lake in Algonquin Park. Sections of the original frontier roads around Ryan and Ravensworth now serve as snow-mobile trails, while others have been completely abandoned and allowed to grow wild.\n\nThrough the 1970s Kearney claimed to be \"The Smallest Town in Ontario.\" On December 1, 1979, legislation was passed to amalgamate the town of Kearney, with the geographic townships of Proudfoot and Bethune, as well as the portions of Butt and McCraney townships in Nipissing District that were not part of Algonquin Provincial Park.\n\nIn the mid 90s, a town councillor and Kearney Youth Group founder, Dale Louise Germaney, coined the name \"Ontario's 'Biggest Little Town'\" which is still used to this day.\n\nKearney is a gateway to Algonquin Park wilderness with three access points - one at Tim Lake, one at Magnetawan Lake and most popular, at Rain Lake. Both canoe and hiking routes can be accessed from these park entry points. In the early years, the train took visitors right into the park, with many side trips available from there. Today the roads run right back into the park's three access points. Kearney is well known as a tourist centre, and has a seasonal population of over 2000 people. Kearney's popularity is not only because of its proximity to Algonquin Park, but for its swimming, water sports, camping and fishing. Lakes within the town boundaries, including Clam, Beaver, Fisher, Grass, Island, Loon and Sand Lakes, are vacation destinations for many visitors - boasting cottages, resorts, and campgrounds. Bear, moose and deer hunting provides sport for hunters coming to the area.\n\nThe Kearney Community Centre, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2000, houses the municipal offices, library, and seniors room and banquet facilities. The centre offers indoor activities during the weekdays such as card parties and special interest classes.

During his childhood, he lived on Bolshoi Karetny Lane. During his teens, he would dress as a stilyaga and often got into fights, one such incident resulting in a scar across his stomach (which can be seen in the film \"Igla\", which he starred in over 20 years later). Mamonov's parents separated in the mid 1950s and his mother began a relationship with Nikolai Bortnichuk, also an engineer. This relationship resulted in the birth of Mamonov's half-brother, Aleksei Bortnichuk, on 13 July 1958.\n\nHis first band were a covers band called Express, who were active in the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s, playing covers of popular rock bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, although Mamonov himself preferred black R&B, soul and rock 'n roll music. During the 1970s, he suffered from depression and worked various jobs, including boiler operator and Norwegian translator (he learned the language from his mother). He lived with the artist Olga Gorokhova between 1979 and 1981. Gorokhova stated that Mamonov would listen to a lot of Weather Report during this period.\n\nIn 1982, he began Zvuki Mu. The name originates from a series of affectionate names beginning with the syllable \"mu\" that Mamonov and Gorokhova would call each other, though the earliest occurrence of the name \"Zvuki Mu\" occurs in some of Mamonov's poetry from the late 1960s. Between 1986 and late 1987, he wore a moustache – it can be seen in images of Mamonov from that period, such as the images inside the booklet of the compilation \"Mamonov '84–'87\".\n\nMamonov was one of the few rock musicians from former USSR who managed to achieve recognition abroad, through his collaboration with Brian Eno in the late 1980s. Around the same period he started acting in films, and over the next decade wrote, produced and acted in several one-man theatrical performances establishing himself as a cult figure in Russia.\n\nZvuki Mu initially performed between 1982 and 1990, after which Mamonov started a new band called Mamonov and Aleksei with his half-brother Aleksei Bortnichuk. The new band performed music of a similar style to Zvuki Mu, using backing tracks instead of live drums, but in 1993-4, they acquired a live drummer and developed a new, back-to-basics hard rock sound, with Mamonov rewriting some older Zvuki Mu songs to fit in with this style. They released one album in 1992 and were recording a second one when Mamonov decided to rename the group to Zvuki Mu, resulting in the release of Zvuki Mu's \"Gruby zakat\" album in 1995.\n\nIn 1996, after disagreements between Mamonov and the other Zvuki Mu members, the band broke up again, with \"Zvuki Mu\" becoming just a pseudonym for Mamonov's solo work. He switched to using his own name for music in 2005, but in 2015, he formed a new band, \"Sovershenno novye Zvuki Mu\" (Brand New Zvuki Mu) with musicians from the indie band Stoneberry.\n\nIn August 2019, Mamonov suffered a heart attack, necessitating the cancellation of his concerts for two and a half months while he had surgery.\n\nOne of Mamonov's best-known film appearances is in the leading role in Pavel Lungin's 1990 \"Taxi Blues\". His theatre creations include \"Is There Life on Mars?\", an absurdist take on Anton Chekhov's \"A Marriage Proposal\", and \"Chocolate Pushkin\", which makes a comical reference to (but doesn't cite) the Russian national poet Alexander Pushkin. Piotr explains the name for the album as his own comparison to a popular DJ who calls himself \"Black Elvis\" and also describes the genre on this record as \"lit-hop\" (literature hip-hop).\n\nIn 2001 he appeared in a short but characteristic role in Serguei Loban's \"Dust\" () that was released only 4 years later and became a cult film. He returned to play the lead role in Pavel Lungin's religious film \"The Island\" (Russian: \"Остров\"), which closed the 2006 Venice Film Festival. His acting in the film was praised by Alexis II, Patriarch of Moscow, and won him a Best Actor Nika Award.\n\nIn 2009 Pavel Lungin invited him again to appear in his new production entitled \"Tsar\" (Russian Царь). Mamonov plays the title hero, tsar Ivan the Terrible, a character torn between passionate faith and cruelty.\n\nIn 1995, he stated in an interview that he enjoyed listening to alternative rock, heavy metal and grunge, naming Nine Inch Nails, Jane's Addiction, the Butthole Surfers, White Zombie and Pantera as examples.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mamonov converted to Orthodox Christianity, left the capital, and settled in a village.\n\n"}

It started out as a small theater called the Gem, which showed silent movies with a piano for music. It was later closed down and demolished, but rebuilt and expanded into the Iris Theater by owner Tony Duvall. After his retirement, the Iris changed hands several times before being renamed the Vista.\n\nThe National Register of Historic Places, notes Iris Theater, Apartments and Commercial Building, built in 1930, is significant for its role in the urbanization of Murray City. With its combination of entertainment, retail, and residential space, the building represents an elaborate example of the multi-use commercial block common during the early twentieth-century development of the city's commercial business district. The building was owned by the Duvall family who managed the theater while living in the apartments above the storefronts. The Iris building is also significant as the only commercial building in Murray built in the Art Deco style. Though not a particularly ornate example of the style, the building makes a distinctive contribution to the State Street frontage of the Murray Downtown Historic District. The building is in good condition and is a contributing historic resource of the city.\n\nThe Iris was considered state-of-the-art at the time. The theater showed both blockbusters (e.g.\n\"Gone with the Wind\"), and more obscure fare (e.g. some Thursday nights were reserved for Swedish films shown especially for Swedish immigrants brought to Murray by the smelters). The theater had a stage where local groups could mount theatrical productions. The Iris Theater was a\ncommunity place. Murray firemen sometimes held conventions there. Many of Murray's youths,\nincluding the Duvall children, worked in the theater. During the Great Depression, Tony Duvall would\nsometimes let children see a movie in exchange for scrap metal, or sometimes simply for free. Tony\nDuvall, with partner Joe Lawrence, later built the Murray Theater at 4961 South State. In the 1940s, the Iris would close during the summer while movies were shown in the larger (and cooler) Murray Theater.\n\nThe theater first became Desert Star when Mike and Alyce Todd attempted to produce a play near This Is The Place Heritage Park. This play was the first to exhibit the common traits found today in Desert Star plays. After the summer ended, they attempted to find an indoor location for their plays. They considered the closed down Vista, and eventually took it and renamed it the Desert Star Playhouse.\n\nIn 2000, after several successful plays, the city of Murray said that the building had to be brought up to code or torn down. The owner wanted to go with the latter, but the Todds decided to buy the theater and renovate. Today, the playhouse features Dinner and Cabaret theaters, as well as performing two shows in different theaters.\n\nDesert Star is known for parody plays, doing comedic spoofs of classic movies and stories. They are also known for political jokes, and their themes tend to revolve around Utah. Each show also ends with a musical olio, in which the performers dress up in various costumes and do musical numbers.\n\n\n\n"}

Johnson hides motionless behind some eucalyptus branches and waits for unsuspecting people to wander by. When they approach, he shakes the bush towards the unsuspecting tourists and startles them, sometimes making gruff \"oogah-boogah\" noises, while in-the-know observers giggle. Crowds gather to watch him work, often including those he has previously scared. The Bushman typically operates toward the western end of the Wharf (at Jefferson and Hyde Streets or thereabouts), well to the west of the Grotto. Johnson used to work with or, at different points in time, as a rival to a second Bushman, Gregory Jacobs, until the death of Jacobs in 2014.\n\nCrowds usually watch Johnson across the street from where he usually sits, to see him entertain people.\n\nIn a \"good year\", Johnson claims to earn $60,000. However, he cited the same figure to one of his victims (after said victim chided him) in 1992. At one point, he employed a bodyguard to protect himself against attacks by the unamused, distract his targets, and to alert him to the approach of elderly people so he could avoid scaring them.\n\nThe police have received a number of complaints about the Bushman, and Fisherman's Wharf merchants have tried to shut him down. In 2004, he was charged with four misdemeanors, but a jury cleared him. The District Attorney subsequently dropped several remaining public nuisance complaints.\n\nAlthough engaging in his street performance utilizing the bush as a prop, as of the mid 1990s, Johnson did not formally refer to himself as \"The Bushman\" until he was befriended by then Alameda residents John and daughter Alison Nowakowski, who would refer to him as such. Eventually, the name stuck and Johnson adopted the name as his formal street performing moniker.\n\nWhile it is clear that from the 1990s until the death of Gregory Jacobs in 2014, two World Famous Bushmen operated on Fisherman's Wharf both as a team and as separate acts, sources differ as to whether Jacobs or Johnson was first to come up with the act.\n\nA 2009 article in SFSU's Xpress Magazine says:\nMany people are unaware that there are, in fact, two Bushmen. When Gregory Jacobs first came up with this gig, he recruited David Johnson, a man he met at Fisherman's Wharf. As they worked together they developed a close friendship. Johnson's deep voice scares those who unknowingly pass by the man-made bush. Back then, Johnson would hold the bush and Jacobs would tell the jokes, entertain those watching the action, and collect the tips. It has been about fifteen years, and now they are complete enemies. Jacobs accuses Johnson of running off with their money. Jacobs tries to avoid any conflicts with Johnson by not working where and when he is.\" \nHowever, the San Francisco Chronicle reports that Johnson was the original Bushman, joined by Jacobs in the 1990s. An article from 1999 suggests that Jacobs joined Johnson in a bodyguard role as well as to help with the act: \"'I look after him,' says Gregory Jacobs, who recently joined the act as a full partner. 'I watch his back.' \n\nGreg Jacobs was featured in the video \"Act (Diogenes)\" by the artist Whitney Lynn. Jacobs is also the subject of a short film, \"The Bush Man\". Gregory Jacobs died February 23, 2014 due to heart failure at the age of 60 years old, whilst Johnson remains active.\n\nThe Bushman was also featured in a holiday video for HEAT, an advertising agency in San Francisco, California\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2191393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191393", "title": "Plasmodium ovale", "text": "Plasmodium ovale\n\nPlasmodium ovale is a species of parasitic protozoa that causes tertian malaria in humans. It is one of several species of \"Plasmodium\" parasites that infect humans including \"Plasmodium falciparum\" and \"Plasmodium vivax\" which are responsible for most malarial infection. It is rare compared to these two parasites, and substantially less dangerous than \"P. falciparum\".\n\nP. ovale has recently been shown by genetic methods to consist of two subspecies, \"P. ovale curtisi\" and \"P. ovale wallikeri\".\n\nThis species was first described in 1914 by Stephens in a blood sample taken in the autumn of 1913 from a patient in the sanitarium of Pachmari in central India and sent by Major W. H. Kenrick to Stephens (who was working in Liverpool).\n\n\"P. ovale\" is primarily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and islands in the western Pacific. However \"P. ovale\" has also been reported in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, as well as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam\n\nIn several studies, the reported prevalence of \"P. ovale\" was low relative to other malaria parasites, with fewer than 5% of malaria cases being associated with \"P. ovale\" infection. Higher prevalences of \"P. ovale\" are possible under certain conditions, as at least one study in Cameroon found the prevalence of \"P. ovale\" infection to be greater than 10%.\n\nIt has been estimated that there are about 15 million cases of infection each year with this parasite.\n\nWhile similar to \"P. vivax\", \"P. ovale\" is able to infect individuals who are negative for the Duffy blood group, which is the case for many residents of sub Saharan Africa. This explains the greater prevalence of \"P. ovale\" (rather than \"P. vivax\") in most of Africa.\nIn humans, symptoms generally appear 12 to 20 days after the parasite has entered the blood. In the blood, the parasite's replication cycle lasts approximately 49 hours, causing tertian fever which spikes approximately every 49 hours as newly replicated parasites erupt out of red blood cells. Mean maximum parasite levels have been found to be 6,944/microl for sporozoite-induced infections and 7,310/microl for trophozoite-induced infections.\n\nIn some cases, relapse may occur up to 4 years after infection.\n\nThe microscopic appearance of \"P. ovale\" is very similar to that of \"P. vivax\" and if there are only a small number of parasites seen, it may be impossible to distinguish the two species on morphological grounds alone. There is no difference between the medical treatment of \"P. ovale\" and \"P. vivax\", and therefore some laboratory diagnoses report \"\"P. vivax/ovale\"\", which is perfectly acceptable as treatment for the two are very similar. Schüffner's dots are seen on the surface of the parasitised red blood cell, but these are larger and darker than in \"P. vivax\" and are sometimes called James' dots or James' stippling. About twenty percent of the parasitised cells are oval in shape (hence the species name) and some of the oval cells also have fimbriated edges (the so-called \"comet cell\"). The mature schizonts of \"P. ovale\" never have more than twelve nuclei within them and this is the only reliable way of distinguishing between the two species.\n\n\"P. vivax\" and \"P. ovale\" that has been sitting in EDTA for more than half-an-hour before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to \"P. malariae\", which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives.\n\nMolecular tests (tests that look for DNA material from \"P. ovale\" in blood) must take into account the fact that there are two subspecies of ovale and tests designed for one subspecies may not necessarily detect the other.\n\nStandard treatment is concurrent treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. The combination atovaquone-proguanil may be used in those patients who are unable to take chloroquine for whatever reason.\nAn overdose on Chloroquine can be very dangerous and can result in death.\n\nAmong the species infecting the great apes, \"Plasmodium schwetzi\" morphologically appears to be the closest relation to \"P.ovale\". this had not been confirmed by DNA studies.\n\nThe original species has been shown to be two morphologically identical forms – \"Plasmodium ovale curtisi\" and \"Plasmodium ovale wallikeri\" – which can be differentiated only by genetic means. Both species have been identified in Ghana, Myanmar, Nigeria, São Tomé, Sierra Leone and Uganda. The separation of the lineages is estimated to have occurred between 1.0 and 3.5 million years ago in hominid hosts. A second analysis suggests that these species separated (95% confidence interval 0.5 – 7.7 Mya). A third worked sequenced the whole genome of both species, confirmed the differences and dated the split at around million years. Although dating is always difficult, the authors date that split to be 5 times older than the \"P. falciparum\" and \"P. reichenowi\" split.\n\nThese species appear to be more closely related to \"Plasmodium malariae\" than to \"Plasmodium vivax\".\n\nThe two species appear to differ in their biology with \"P. ovale wallikeri\" having a shorter latency period than \"P. ovale curtisi\".\n\n\"P. ovale\" is introduced into the human host by the bite of an infected mosquito, in a motile form called a sporozoite. The sporozoites are carried by the blood to the liver, where they replicate asexually by merogony into non-motile merozoites. Several hundred merozoites are produced and released into the blood stream where they infect erythrocytes. Inside the erythrocyte, the parasite's replication cycle takes approximately 49 hours, after which the erythrocyte ruptures and between 8 and 20 merozoites are released to infect other erythrocytes. Some of these merozoites will instead form gametocytes which remain in the blood and are ingested by a mosquito.\n\nWhen gametocytes are ingested by a mosquito, the gametocytes enter the mosquito gut where fertilisation occurs forming a zygote known as an ookinete. The ookinete moves to the outer wall of the mosquito midgut where it develops over the course of several weeks. This developing stage is called an oocyst. After the oocyst develops, it ruptures releasing several hundred sporozoites. The sporozoites are carried by the mosquito's circulation to the mosquito salivary glands. When the mosquito feeds again, the sporozoites enter through the salivary duct and are injected into a new host, starting the life cycle again.\n\nThere are situations where some of the sporozoites do not immediately start to grow and divide after entering the hepatocyte, but remain in a dormant, hypnozoite stage for weeks or months. The duration of latency is variable from one hypnozoite to another and the factors that will eventually trigger growth are not known; this explains how a single infection can be responsible for a series of waves of parasitaemia or \"relapses\".\nWhile humans appear to be the natural mammalian host of \"P. ovale\", chimpanzees and \"Saimiri\" monkeys have also been experimentally infected.\n\n\"Anopheles gambiae\" and \"Anopheles funestus\" are likely the natural mosquito hosts of \"P. ovale\". Experimentally, several other mosquito species have been shown to be capable of transmitting \"P. ovale\" to humans, including:\n\nThe full genomes of the two \"P. ovale\" species can be seen on geneDB.org – \"P. ovali curtisi\" \"P. ovale wallikeri\" and plasmoDB.org, published 2017.\n\n\n"}

It was first published in 1959 in the United Kingdom as The Minnipins and in the United States as The Gammage Cup. It was later republished by Scholastic in November 1991 and by Harcourt in 2000. It tells the story of a race of little people called the Minnipins who, despite inner divisions, must unite to defend their village and the valley in which they live against an evil race of humanoid creatures called the Mushrooms or Hairless Ones. The sequel, \"The Whisper of Glocken\", was published in 1965.\n\nThemes in the book include conformity and individualism. The book also includes several references to the real world including the poem Mary Had a Little Lamb and several common abbreviations such as ltd., co., bros., etc. It was highly praised and became a Newbery Honor book and an ALA Notable Children's Book. Audiobook and cartoon versions of the book were also created.\n\nCaroll Kendall became interested in writing for children when her first novel \"The Black Seven\" was published in 1946. She enjoyed writing about children and eventually decided to write children's stories. Of her first forays into fantasy writing she says, \"I thought I didn't know enough to write fantasy, and then suddenly I had a theme to work on and gradually the characters became real\". Kendall's main character Muggles was inspired by a friend who often joked about being in a muddle. an article in \"Child Life\" inspired her to write about the dangers of conformity. She said:\n\nIt was about a costume party, and went something like this: 'Everybody' was having costume birthday parties that yearit was the very latest fad and the mothers met in protest to plan an end to their children's obsessive copy-catism. When the day of the party finally came and the children began to arrive at the birthday house, they found that their secret costumes were exactly like all the other secret costumes. They were a party of sheep.\n\n\"The Gammage Cup\" was illustrated by Erik Blegvad and was first published in 1959 by Harcourt Brace in New York. The copyright on the book expired and was renewed in 1987. It was later published by Scholastic in 1991 and then by Harcourt in 2000 with cover art by Tim and Greg Hildebrandt. The book was also published in the United Kingdom under the title of \"The Minnipins\". Its sequel \"The Whisper of Glocken\" was published in 1965.\n\nThe story starts in a fictional valley named the Land Between the Mountains. It is surrounded by four mountain ranges: Snowdrift to the north, Frostbite to the south, the Sunrise Mountains to the east and the Sunset Mountains to the west. This valley is populated by twelve villages of Minnipins, a race of industrious \"little people\" rather like hobbits. The novel takes place in a village called Slipper-on-the-Water, in and around the gold mines in the Sunset Mountains and on a nearby knoll where the outlaws live. The date of the story is given as the year of Gammage\n\nSlipper-on-the-Water is home to a clan known as the Periods, who are descendants of Fooley the Magnificent or the Great Fooley, who 440 years before the book opens constructed a balloon, flew to the land beyond the mountains and returned with a case of curiosities. They hold high offices in Slipper-on-the-Water, have very high opinions of themselves and have a \"Council of Periods\" that rules the village. Also living in the village are a group of Minnipins referred to as \"Them\" by the other villagers. These include Gummy, Walter the Earl and Curley Green. \"Them\" shun the tradition-based existence of the other Minnipins. One night, a Minnipin named Muggles wakes up and sees fires in the Sunset Mountains in the West. While digging for treasure, Walter the Earl discovers a vault under his house and finds iron chests that contain ancient scrolls, swords, armor and military trumpets. The scrolls reveal that Fooley the Magnificent's story and contain ominous warnings from Walter the Earl's forebear Walter the Obtuse saying that the vault will be found when it is needed for the protection of the Minnipins.\n\nThe mayor returns from the annual meeting of village mayors with news that there will be a contest to find the finest village in the Land Between the Mountains. The winning village will win the legendary and sacred Gammage Cup. The villagers are excited but the Periods convince the villagers that \"Them\" will ruin their chances of winning the cup. During a town meeting, the Periods outlaw \"Them\". Mingy, the curmudgeonly money-keeper who resists spending money for \"fancying up the village\" is also outlawed. Along with Muggles who has become involved with \"Them\" because of her seeing the fires on the Sunset Mountains.\n\nThe \"Outlaws\" paddle up the river to Gummy's stone cabin on The Knoll. They move in but the cabin is too small for all of them and decide to sleep outside until a new house is built. Muggles organizes their working efforts and after much progress is made, they explore the Old Mines in the Sunset Mountains. Walter the Earl brings an iron sword from the vault. Inside the mines the sword glows as a warning, and they hear tapping sounds. After this phenomenon occurs again, they assume that the legendary enemies of the Minnipins known as The Mushrooms have returned and are preparing to attack, and they hold a council of war.\n\nMuggles decides that Mingy should reconnoiter the Old Mines while the rest of the \"Outlaws\" wait behind. In the mines, Mingy sees several hairless creatures with mushroom-colored skin round bellies and big ears and wearing tight, brownish-white clothes. Over 200 of them emerge from the mines. Mingy concludes that these must be the Mushrooms and tries to return to the others, but his is foot is trapped in the rocks. The rest of the Outlaws rush to save Mingy as the Mushrooms swarm to capture him. They chase most of the Mushrooms away but four of them capture Mingy and carry him into the mountain. Gummy chases them into the Old Mines and returns after he is hit by a poisonous spear.\n\nThe group return to Gummy's cabin to tend to his worsening wound. Curly Green and Muggles stay and defend Gummy while Walter the Earl returns to Slipper-on-the-Water to raise an army to fight the Mushrooms. Walter the Earl tries to tell the Periods mayor and council about the coming Mushroom army but they will not listen. He decides to raise the village without the help of the Periods. He is successful, but the Periods tell the villagers the Walter is deranged and the villagers are uncertain what to do. An eerie chanting is heard from the mountains.\n\nIn the Old Mines, the Mushroom chief refuses to kill Mingy. One of the Mushrooms is scratched by a poison spear and Mingy watches as a white substance is used on the scratch, and thinks this may help his foot. After the Mushrooms leave to fight, he puts some on his foot, which feels better. The Mushroom army attacks the cabin where Gummy, Curly Green and Muggles are hiding. Gummy becomes weak because of the poison from the spear and Curly Green is knocked out while Muggles wards off the Mushrooms. The Minnipin army attacks and a fierce battle ensues. As the Mushrooms flee back into the Old Mines, Mingy sets a heap of mats on fire, making it impossible for the Mushrooms to escape. They rush out to escape the flames and are defeated by the Minnipin army. Mingy emerges from the cave holding the pot of white substance which is used cure Gummy and the injured Minnipins soldiers.\n\nThe Period village council regrets expelling the Outlaws and no longer cares about winning the Gammage Cup. The villagers celebrate the return of the soldiers and the five Outlaws. The three judges of the contest arrive. Witnessing the happy scene, they decide that Slipper-on-the-Water is the most deserving village and leave the Gammage Cup in the town square.\n\n\nThe Periods are descendants of Fooley the \"magnificent\". They are each given one of the \"names\" from Fooley's book. They tend to have positions of prominence in the Minnipin society.\n\n\nMost of the villagers are distinguished by their trade and their names.\n\n\n\nThe Mushrooms are big bellied, mushroom colored, have almost no hair, and smell like mushrooms. They speak a strange language and are all killed and burned in a funeral pyre.\n\nThe main theme in the book is conformity verses nonconformity. Kendall uses five characters who do not fit in with their society but are able show their worth in saving it. The \"New York Times Book Review\" called the book a \"fable about conformists and non-conformists\". A reviewer from the \"Black Gate\" said the book is \"a warning against 1950's conformist tendencies\".\n\nAnother theme used in the book is uniting against a common foe. Although the Periods and the outcasts are initially in opposition to one another, they are forced to reconcile their differences when they are all threatened by the Mushrooms. The theme of individualism are prevalent throughout the book. When Muggles is invited to return to the village by Ltd., she tells him she is no longer \"poor simple Muggles\" (184) and has gained individuality in her life at the knoll. Horn Book said that the book offers \"insights into the value of individualism\". Muggles' heroism makes the book appear feminist; Kendall neither confirmed or denied this, saying \"I just write the way it is\".\n\nAnother theme is a kind of military racism, or species-ism. The Mushrooms are clearly described as different, although they would seem to be human, to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins feel no pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.\n\nA review of the book by \"Horn Book Magazine\" said, \"This highly creative fantasy ... will be a gift book treasured by the entire family\" (Back cover). \"The New York Times Book Review\" called it \"highly amusing, imaginative, and thought provoking\". In 2001, a review in \"Black Gate\" described \"The Gammage Cup\" as readable and enjoyable with a cute turn of phrase and clever notions, though standing \"at best in the second rank of the great children's fantasies.\" The reviewer said it includes the typical 1950s themes of conformity and the threat from outsiders.\n\n\"The Gammage Cup\" was named a Newbery Honor Book for 1960. It was one of Horn Book's best books of 1959 and won the Ohioana book award in 1960.\n\nInterest in the book was revived during the 1999 lawsuit between Nancy Stouffer and J.K. Rowling over the creation of the name \"Muggles\". An article in the \"Lawrence Journal-World\" on June 14, 2000, said Kendall had used the name about 30 years before Stouffer and Rowling. Kendall found the incident amusing and was not ill-disposed towards either author. Speaking about the copying, she said, \"I've got no quarrel with them ... There's only so many ideas and if you have one then someone else out there probably has the same one, too.\"\n\nA cartoon version of \"The Gammage Cup\" was created by Hanna-Barbera and aired on \"CBS Storybreak\" in 1982 and was later aired with closed captions. The cartoon stuck to the main premise of the book but changed the storyline.\n\nAn audiobook version of \"The Gammage Cup\" was produced by Recorded Books in 2000. It was read by Christina Moore who was praised by \"School Library Journal\", which said it conveys \"the full emotional range of each character\". The reviewer also said, \"Moore consistently nails the perfect tone of the story\" and, \"this delightful fantasy is sure to please fans on several levelshumor, suspense, plot twists, winsome characters, and adventure\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2191408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191408", "title": "Plasmodium malariae", "text": "Plasmodium malariae\n\nPlasmodium malariae is a parasitic protozoan that causes malaria in humans. It is one of several species of \"Plasmodium\" parasites that infect humans, including also \"Plasmodium falciparum\" and \"Plasmodium vivax\", responsible for most malarial infection. Found worldwide, it causes a so-called \"benign malaria\", not nearly as dangerous as that produced by \"P. falciparum\" or \"P. vivax\". The signs include fevers that recur at approximately three-day intervals – a \"quartan fever\" or \"quartan malaria\" – longer than the two-day (tertian) intervals of the other malarial parasites.\n\nMalaria has been recognized since the Greek and Roman civilizations over 2,000 years ago, with different patterns of fever described by the early Greeks. In 1880, Alphonse Laveran discovered that the causative agent of malaria is a parasite. Detailed work of Golgi in 1886 demonstrated that in some patients there was a relationship between the 72-hour life cycle of the parasite and the chill and fever patterns in the patient. The same observation was found for parasites with 48-hour cycles. Golgi concluded that there must be more than one species of malaria parasite responsible for these different patterns of infection.\n\nEach year, approximately 500 million people will be infected with malaria worldwide Of those infected, roughly two million will die from the disease. Malaria is caused by six \"Plasmodium\" species: \"Plasmodium falciparum\", \"Plasmodium vivax,\" \"Plasmodium ovale curtisi\", \"Plasmodium ovale wallikeri\", \"Plasmodium malariae\" and \"Plasmodium knowlesi\". At any one time, an estimated 300 million people are said to be infected with at least one of these \"Plasmodium\" species and so there is a great need for the development of effective treatments for decreasing the yearly mortality and morbidity rates.\n\"P. malariae\" is the one of the least studied of the six species that infect humans, in part because of its low prevalence and milder clinical manifestations compared to the other species. It is widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, much of southeast Asia, Indonesia, on many of the islands of the western Pacific and in areas of the Amazon Basin of South America. In endemic regions, prevalence ranges from less than 4% to more than 20%, but there is evidence that \"P. malariae\" infections are vastly underreported.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) has an application that allows people to view specific parts of the world and how they are affected by \"Plasmodium vivax\", and other types of the \"Plasmodium\" parasite. It can be found at the following link: http://cdc.gov/malaria/map/index.html.\n\n\"P. malariae\" can infect several species of mosquito and can cause malaria in humans. \"P. malariae\" can be maintained at very low infection rates among a sparse and mobile population because unlike the other \"Plasmodium\" parasites, it can remain in a human host for an extended period of time and still remain infectious to mosquitoes.\n\nThe vector of transmission of the parasite is the female Anopheles mosquito, but many different species have been shown to transmit the parasite at least experimentally. Collins and Jeffrey report over thirty different types of species, which vary by geographic region.\n\nInformation about the prepatent period, or the period of time between the infection of the parasite and demonstration of that parasite within the body, of \"P. malariae\" associated malaria is limited, but the data suggests that there is great variation, often the length of time depending on the strain of \"P. malariae\" parasite. Usually, the prepatent period ranges from 16 to 59 days.\n\n\"Plasmodium malariae\" causes a chronic infection that in some cases can last a lifetime. The \"P. malariae\" parasite has several differences between it and the other \"Plasmodium\" parasites, one being that maximum parasite counts are usually low compared to those in patients infected with \"P. falciparum\" or \"P. vivax.\" The reason for this can be accounted for by the lower number of merozoites produced per erythrocytic cycle, the longer 72-hour developmental cycle (compared to the 48-hour cycle of \"P. vivax\" and \"P. falciparum\"), the preference for development in older erythrocytes and the resulting earlier development of immunity by the human host.\nAnother defining feature of \"P. malariae\" is that the fever manifestations of the parasite are more moderate relative to those of \"P. falciparum\" and \"P. vivax\" and fevers show quartan periodicity. Along with bouts of fever and more general clinical symptoms such as chills and nausea, the presence of edema and the nephrotic syndrome has been documented with some \"P. malariae\" infections. It has been suggested that immune complexes may cause structural glomerular damage and that renal disease may also occur. Although \"P. malariae\" alone has a low morbidity rate, it does contribute to the total morbidity caused by all \"Plasmodium\" species, as manifested in the incidences of anemia, low birth rate and reduced resistance to other infections.\n\nDue to a similarity in the appearances of the pathogens, \"P. knowlesi\" infections are often misdiagnosed as \"P. malariae\" infections. Molecular analysis is usually required for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe preferable method for diagnosis of \"P. malariae\" is through the examination of peripheral blood films stained with Giemsa stain. PCR techniques are also commonly used for diagnoses confirmation as well as to separate mixed \"Plasmodium\" infections. Even with these techniques, however, it may still be impossible to differentiate infections, as is the case in areas of South America where humans and monkeys coexist and \"P. malariae\" and \"P. brasilianum\" are not easily distinguishable.\n\n\"P. malariae\" is the only human malaria parasite that causes fevers that recur at approximately three-day intervals (therefore occurring every fourth day, a \"quartan fever\"), longer than the two-day (\"tertian\") intervals of the other malarial parasites.\n\nIn this stage, many thousands of merozoites are produced in each schizont. As the merozoites are released, they invade erythrocytes and initiate the erythrocytic cycle, where the parasite digests hemoglobin to obtain amino acids for protein synthesis.\n\nThe total length of the intraerythrocytic development, is roughly 72 hours for \"P. malariae\".\n\nAt the schizont stage, after schizogonic division, there are roughly 6–8 parasite cells in the erythrocyte.\n\nFollowing the erythrocytic cycle, which lasts for seventy two hours on average, six to fourteen merozoites are released to reinvade other erythrocytes. Finally, some of the merozoites develop into either micro- or macrogametocytes. The two types of gametocytes are taken into the mosquito during feeding and the cycle is repeated. There are no animal reservoirs for \"P. malariae.\"\n\nSimilar to the other human-infecting \"Plasmodium\" parasites, \"Plasmodium malariae\" has distinct developmental cycles in the Anopheles mosquito and in the human host. The mosquito serves as the definitive host and the human host is the intermediate. When the Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected individual, gametocytes are ingested from the infected person. A process known as exflagellation of the microgametocyte soon ensues and up to eight mobile microgametes are formed.\n\nFollowing fertilization of the macrogamete, a mobile ookinete is formed, which penetrates the peritropic membrane surrounding the blood meal and travels to the outer wall of the mid-gut of the mosquito. The oocyst then develops under the basal membrane and after a period of two to three weeks a variable amount of sporozoites are produced within each oocyst. The number of sporozoites that are produced varies with temperature and can range from anywhere between many hundreds to a few thousand.\nEventually, the oocyst ruptures and the sporozoites are released into the hemocoel of the mosquito. The sporozoites are then carried by the circulation of the hemolymph to the salivary glands, where they become concentrated in the acinal cells. A small number of sporozoites are introduced into the salivary duct and injected into the venules of the bitten human. This initiates the cycle in the human liver.\n\nThe ring stages that are formed by the invasion of merozoites released by rupturing liver stage schizonts are the first stages that appear in the blood. The ring stages grow slowly but soon fill one-fourth to one-third of the parasitized cell. Pigment increases rapidly and the half-grown parasite may have from 30 to 50 jet-black granules. The parasite changes various shapes as it grows and stretches across the host cell to form the band form.\n\n\"P. vivax\" and \"P. ovale\" sitting in EDTA for more than 30 minutes before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to \"P. malariae\", which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives.\n\nMicroscopically, the parasitised red blood cell (erythrocyte) is never enlarged and may even appear smaller than that of normal red blood cells. The cytoplasm is not decolorized and no dots are visible on the cell surface. The food vacuole is small and the parasite is compact. Cells seldom host more than one parasite. Band forms, where the parasite forms a thick band across the width of the infected cell, are characteristic of this species (and some would say is diagnostic). Large grains of malarial pigment are often seen in these parasites: more so than any other \"Plasmodium\" species, 8 merozoites.\n\nFailure to detect some \"P. malariae\" infections has led to modifications of the species-specific primers and to efforts towards the development of real-time PCR assays. The development of such an assay has included the use of generic primers that target a highly conserved region of the 18S rRNA genes of the four human-infecting species of \"Plasmodium\". This assay was found to be highly specific and sensitive. Although serologic tests are not specific enough for diagnostic purposes, they can be used as basic epidemiologic tools. The immunofluorescent-antibody (IFA) technique can be used to measure the presence of antibodies to \"P. malariae.\". A pattern has emerged in which an infection of short duration causes a rapidly declining immune response, but upon re-infection or recrudescence, the IFA level rises significantly and remains present for many months or years.\n\nThe increasing need to correctly identify \"P. malariae\" infection is underscored by its possible anti-malarial resistance. In a study by Müller-Stöver \"et al.,\" the researchers presented three patients who were found to be infected with the parasite after taking anti-malarial medications. Given the slower pre-erythrocytic development and longer incubation period compared to the other malaria causing \"Plasmodium\" species, the researchers hypothesized that the anti-malarials may not be effective enough against the pre-erythrocytic stages of \"P. malariae.\" They thought that further development of \"P. malariae\" can occur when plasma concentrations of the anti-malarials gradually decrease after the anti-malarial medications are taken. According to Dr. William E. Collins from the Center of Disease Control (CDC), chloroquine is most commonly used for treatment and no evidence of resistance to this drug has been found. In that event, it is possible that the results from Müller-Stöver \"et al.\" provided isolated incidences.\n\nThe food vacuole is the specialized compartment that degrades hemoglobin during the asexual erythrocytic stage of the parasite. It is implied that effective drug treatments can be developed by targeting the proteolytic enzymes of the food vacuole. In a paper published in 1997, Westling \"et al.\" focused their attention on the aspartic endopeptidase class of enzymes, simply called plasmepsins. They sought to characterize the specificity for the enzymes cloned from \"P. vivax\" and \"P. malariae.\" Using substrate specificity studies and inhibitor analysis, it was found that the plasmepsins for \"P. malariae\" and \"P. vivax\" showed less specificity than that for \"P. falciparum.\" Unfortunately, this means that the development of a selective inhibitor for \"P. malariae\" may prove more challenging than the development of one for \"P. falciparum.\"\nAnother study by Bruce \"et al.\" presented evidence that there may be regular genetic exchange within \"P. malariae\" populations. Six polymorphic genetic markers from \"P. malariae\" were isolated and analyzed in 70 samples of naturally acquired \"P. malariae\" infections from different parts of the world. The data showed a high level of multi-genotypic carriage in humans.\n\nBoth of these experiments illustrate that development of vaccine options will prove challenging, if not impossible. Dr. William Collins doubts that anyone is currently looking for possible vaccines for \"P. malariae\" and given the complexity of the parasite it can be inferred why. He states that very few studies are conducted with this parasite, perhaps as a result of its perceived low morbidity and prevalence. Collins cites the great restrictions of studies with chimpanzees and monkeys as a sizeable barrier. Since the \"Plasmodium brasilianium\" parasite that infects South American monkeys is thought to be an adapted form of \"P. malariae,\" more research with \"P. brasilianium\" may hold valuable insight into \"P. malariae.\"\n\nThe continuing work with the plasmepsin associated with \"P. malariae,\" plasmepsin 4, by Professor Ben Dunn and his research team from the University of Florida may provide hope for long term malaria control in the near future.\n\nIn 2017 the full genome was published. The sequences can be accessed on geneDB.org and plasmoDB.org.\n\n"}

It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Namangan Region. Namangan is located in the northern edge of the Fergana Valley, less than 30 km from the Kyrgyzstan border. The city is served by Namangan Airport.\n\nNamangan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 17th century. Many factories were built in the city during Soviet times. During World War II, industrial production in Namangan increased fivefold compared with that of 1926–1927. Currently, Namangan is mainly a center for light industry, especially in food.\nThe officially registered population of the city was 475,700 in 2014. Uzbeks are the largest ethnic group.\n\nThe city takes its name from the local salt mines (in Persian نمک‌کان (\"namak kan\") — \"a salt mine\"). Babur mentioned the village of Namangan in his memoirs \"Baburnama\". In his book \"A brief History of the Khanate of Kokand\" () (Kazan, 1886), the Russian ethnographer Vladimir Petrovich Nalivkin wrote that Namangan is mentioned in legal documents dating back to 1643.\n\nNamangan, like many other cities in the Fergana valley, was originally populated by Sogdian people, although it later became a Persian speaking city; the local variety of Persian became known as the Tajik language. An influx of Turkic-speaking people into the region, starting in late medieval times, led to turkification. While Namangan still had a Tajik majority until the middle of the 19th century, identification of its residents with Turkic rather than Iranian cultures has increased. By the late 20th century, most residents of Namangan speak Uzbek, albeit with a significant Tajik-speaking minority.\n\nPolitically, Namangan became a part of the Uyghur Empire of the Karakhanid State and was known to have been a settlement in the 15th century. The residents of the ancient city of Akhsikat, which was severely damaged by an earthquake, moved to the then-village of Namangan in 1610. Namangan became a city afterward. On the eve of the Russian invasion in 1867, the town had been a part of the Khanate of Kokand since the middle of the 18th century.\n\nNamangan was hit by a destructive earthquake in 1926 which killed 34 people, injured 72, and destroyed 4,850 houses.\n\nSince Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, Namangan has gained a reputation for Islamic revivalism, with many mosques and schools funded by organizations from Middle Eastern countries, including the extremist Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia that produced jihadist terrorists like Juma Namangani who fought and died in support of the Afghan Taliban and the Al Qaeda. This has also translated into political opposition against the secular government of Uzbekistan. Some women have discarded traditional colorful scarves for large white veils or even the black paranja.\n\nNamangan is located above sea level. The Qoradaryo and Naryn Rivers join together to form the Syr Darya just outside the southern edge of the city.\n\nBy road Namangan is east of Tashkent, west of Andijan, and east of Chust.\n\nNamangan has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: \"BSk\") with cold winters and hot summers. The average July temperature is . The mean temperature in January is .\n\nNamangan is Uzbekistan's third-largest city by population. The population of Namangan was 475,700 in 2014. Uzbeks and Tajiks are the largest ethnic groups.\n\nNamangan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 17th century. After annexation by the Russians in 1867, cotton production and food processing became the dominant economic activity, as it did in many other places in the country. Many factories were built in the city during Soviet times. During World War II, industrial production in Namangan increased fivefold compared with that of 1926–1927. After the war both light and heavy industries increased significantly.\n\nCurrently Namangan is mainly a center for light industry, especially in food. There are 36 joint companies and over 400 small and medium enterprises in the city.\n\nThere are three higher education institutions in Namangan city — Namangan State University, Namangan Engineering Pedagogical Institute, and Namangan Engineering Technological Institute. Namangan State University is the largest, oldest and highest ranked of the three. The city is also home to ten colleges, two vocational schools, four academic lyceums (the best one is Lola academic lyceum under Namangan State University), and 51 general education schools.\n\nThe Mulla Kyrgyz Madrasa () was built in 1912 by a local cotton magnate. The Mosque of Ota Valikhan Tura (), built in 1918, is one of the largest in Central Asia, now home to a local branch of the Wahabi sect. Olmos city is counted among the landmarks of Namangan city.\n\nThe Namangan Natural History Museum houses local archaeological finds. The Hadja Amin Kabri Architectural Complex () has an ornate terra-cotta façade dating from the 18th or 19th century.\n\nAbout west of Namangan are the Akhsikat ruins, a 1st-century settlement on the Syr-Darya River. The former capital of the Fergana Valley was destroyed by the Mongols and rebuilt by the Timurids. It was abandoned in 1620 after an earthquake.\n\nNamangan is served by Namangan Airport which is located 12 km from the city center. The city is also served by a railway station which was built in 1912. Trolleybuses and buses operated in Namangan from 1973 until 2010. They have largely been replaced by public vans (known in Russian as marshrutkas).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2191442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191442", "title": "Magda Olivero", "text": "Magda Olivero\n\nMagda Olivero (née Maria Maddalena Olivero) (25 March 1910 – 8 September 2014), was an Italian operatic soprano. Her career started in 1932 when she was 22, and spanned five decades establishing her \"as an important link between the era of the verismo composers and the modern opera stage\". She has been regarded as \"one of the greatest singers of the twentieth century\". \n\nBorn as Maria Maddalena Olivero in Saluzzo, Italy, she made her singing debut in 1932 on radio in Turin performing Nino Cattozzo's (1886–1961) oratorio, \"I Misteri Dolorosi\". \n\nOlivero performed widely and increasingly successfully until 1941, when she married and retired from the stage, only taking part thereafter in sporadic charity events. Not having had children as she would have liked to, however, she resumed her career ten years later, at the request of Francesco Cilea, who asked her to sing again the title role in his opera \"Adriana Lecouvreur\". She performed this role at the Teatro Grande in Brescia on 3 February 1951, but Cilea did not see his wish come true as he had died less than three months earlier.\n\nFrom 1951 until her final retirement, Olivero appeared in opera houses throughout Italy and, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, all around the world (Europe, Egypt, U.S., Latin America), but never in such premier venues as the Royal Opera House or the Paris Opera. Olivero performed just once at the Vienna State Opera, and exceedingly rarely at La Scala. Among her most renowned interpretations were those of the leading roles in \"Adriana Lecouvreur\", \"Iris\", \"Fedora\", \"Tosca\", \"La Bohème\", \"La Fanciulla del West\", \"La Traviata\", \"La Wally\", \"Madama Butterfly\", \"Manon Lescaut\", \"Mefistofele\", \"Turandot\" (as Liù) and \"La Voix Humaine\", the Italian version of which she premiered in Trieste in 1968.\n\nShe debuted successfully in the United States in 1967 as Medea in the Italian version of Cherubini's \"Médée\", at the Dallas Opera, where she subsequently appeared in 1969 as \"Fedora\", in 1970 as Giorgetta in \"Il Tabarro\" and in a gala concert featuring Poulenc's \"La Voix Humaine\", sung for the first time in French; and finally as \"Tosca\" in 1974. The role of Medea, belonging to an eighteenth-century repertoire that was quite alien to her ordinary interests, was again taken at the Music Hall Theater in Kansas City in 1968, as well as, three years later, at Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, in concert, and eventually at Mantua's Teatro Sociale.\n\nIn 1975, at the age of 65, Olivero made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in \"Tosca\", \"as a late replacement for [Birgit] Nilsson.\" Her only three performances caused a furore, being met with wild applause from audiences, and were later referred to as \"legendary\". Her farewell to the Met's public is narrated in these words in a recent history of the New York theatre:\nHer last performances on stage were in March 1981, in the one-woman opera, \"La Voix Humaine\", in Verona; her stage career ending at age 71, after spanning nearly 50 years. She continued to sing sacred music locally and made occasional singing appearances well into her nineties.\n\nOlivero died at the Istituto Auxologico di Milano aged 104.\n\nDespite having a large cult following everywhere, Magda Olivero was never at the centre of the operatic star system, being largely restricted to Italian provincial theatres, and she was almost completely ignored by the official record industry. There exist only two studio recordings of complete operas featuring Olivero: \"Turandot\" (as Liù, with Gina Cigna, for Cetra Records, 1938) and \"Fedora\" (with Mario Del Monaco and Tito Gobbi, conducted by Lamberto Gardelli, for Decca, 1969). There exists a film, too, drawn from a 1960 RAI-television broadcast of \"Tosca\".\n\nStudio recordings of individual pieces are also rare. Between 1939 and 1953 Olivero was called upon by Cetra to record arias by Puccini, Cilea, Boito, Verdi and others, including the finale of Act 1 of \"La Traviata\", which Rodolfo Celletti described as \"the most fascinating performance of this scene and aria ever committed to the phonograph.\" Apart from these pieces, there are only two other official records: a sacred music recital entitled \"Quando il Canto Diventa Preghiera\", performed at the Angelicum Theatre in Milan (Ariston Records, no longer available at present), and the highlights from \"Francesca da Rimini\" (with Del Monaco, conducted by Nicola Rescigno, for Decca, 1969).\n\nIn 1993, when her stage career had been over for many years, Olivero recorded, with piano accompaniment, \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" (with Marta Moretto as the Princesse de Bouillon): excerpts from this recording were published on the Bongiovanni label. At age 86, she performed Adriana's monologue in Jan Schmidt-Garre's film \"Opera Fanatic\".\n\nIn spite of the scanty interest shown by the official record industry, live recordings exist of many of her performances that are fully able to document her great artistic skills. The extent of Olivero's ability was identified by her great admirer Marilyn Horne, who, in 1975, firmly insisted that the Met should at last engage Olivero: \"she practically gave acting and singing lessons while onstage; honestly, you could learn more from watching an Olivero performance than from reading most books on those very subjects.\"\n\nOn the occasion of her death, sympathetic obituaries appeared in the press around the world. In his \"TheaterJones\" article musician and critic Gregory Sullivan Isaacs reported the following opinion expressed by Emmanuel Villaume, the Dallas Opera's music director, as \"one of the best summaries\" of Olivero's artistry:\nMagda Olivero was a unique artist. People generally praise her mostly for her dramatic stage presence.

She has received the Newbery Honor, Ohioana award, Parents choice award, and the Mythopoeic Society Aslan award.\n\nCarol Kendall was born in Bucyrus, Ohio, and was a graduate of Ohio University. Some of her first books were directed at adults such as \"The Black Seven\" (1946) and \"The Baby Snatcher\" (1952). It was her travels across the world that inspired her folk tale stories. She even gathered old folk tales from other countries and translated them into English for children. Despite her love for traveling, she always loved returning to her home on Holiday Drive and to Kansas.\n\nCarol Kendall married Paul Murray Kendall. He was an English professor, historian, and a biographer. He died in November 1973. She died almost 40 years later, on July 28, 2012, in Lawrence, Kansas. She was survived by two daughters and three grandchildren.\n\nCommenting on her career Kendall once said:\n\nThose six brothers were as fine a set of boys and young men as one could want, but they did talk a lot. By the time I made my belated appearance into the family, they were so well gifted in the flow of conversation that there were few pauses for the addition of one small female voice. So I grew up listening. Family recollections would indicate that I was just one sentence short of being completely mute—my single comment of record (at age four) was \"Thank goodness that noisy thing is gone.\" The noisy thing was my brother Arden, whose goings and comings were as turbulent as a high wind gusting through the house.\n\nBut then came school! I loved school. The teachers also talked a lot, but they did it to me instead of to each other, and their words were about reading and writing—worth all the missed conversations in the world. My voice could be heard at last! Before the year was out, I started to write a \"diary-book\" with my new power. The opening line was \"I saw my first robin today.\" It was also the last line, for clearly I had run out of words I knew how to write. The rest of my thoughts would have to wait a spell.\n\nI am still not adept at entering conversations when there are more than three competing talkers, but I don't mind much because I know I can put my own offerings into the computer and fish them out when the time is ripe.\n\nKendall is most well known for her children's fantasy. Her book \"The Gammage Cup\" was a Newbery Honor book and won the Ohioana award.

It is a parody of the Native American removal policies from the mid 16th century to the early 20th century, particularly with the tribe's evil chanting laugh. The episode references the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, and features Alex Glick, who won a guest voice role in the episode in a contest.\n\nIn the episode, the owners of the Three Feathers Indian Casino have acquired the town of South Park. The citizens are being forced off their land to make way for a new super highway. Faced with saying goodbye to their friends and their way of life, the boys rally the townspeople to fight back against the rich and powerful Indians.\n\nThe boys and their parents go to an Indian casino on a Native American reservation. Kyle's father ends up losing his house betting on blackjack, due to him having a gambling problem. The entire town is bought out by the Native Americans, who plan to tear it down so that they can build a superhighway connecting their casino to Denver. The inhabitants are forced to leave their homes unless they can come up with $300,000 by the next day.\n\nThe boys meet with some of the other children in town to come up with an idea. An unfamiliar new boy named Alex points out that they have to save the town. The boys advise their parents to get all the money they have, and then go bet it at the casino. If they win a round of roulette, they would have enough money to buy back the town, plus $50,000. They miraculously win, but as expected from avid gamblers, bet all their winnings again (on the hopes of winning $12,250,000) and lose. When they are selling their homes, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny try to get them to stand up for the town, as does Alex. Initially the adults say they will move to Middle Park instead, to which the boys say \"...until the Native Americans come to take Middle Park too.\" While the adults remain naive, the four main characters run outside and stand in front of the Native Americans' bulldozers, blocking their path. The townspeople soon join the boys, whilst singing \"Love Is a Battlefield\" by Pat Benatar. The casino's owner, Chief Runs With Premise, plots another way to get rid of the townspeople.\n\nThe Chief decides to give blankets to the townspeople as a peace offering, after infecting the blankets with SARS (mirroring the events of the siege of Fort Pitt). The whole town gets sick, except for Stan, and Stan's father tells Stan he must cure SARS, or \"only 98%\" of the town would be left. At the same time, however, the casino owner's son, Premise Running Thin, gets infected with SARS accidentally because he had shared a drink with one of the Chinese men, and none of the Native Americans' herbs are able to cure him. The owner decides to take out his anger on the townspeople with Operation Shock and awe. Stan goes to a wise old man in a trailer in another town, who gives him an \"inward journey\" brought on by sniffing paint thinner. He discovers the trailer-living white man's way to cure the illness is Campbell's chicken noodle soup, DayQuil, and Sprite, and hands the mixture to the people of South Park, who all recover.\n\nThe casino chief arrives and is shocked to find the people are healthy and not half-dead. He begs them for the cure to SARS for his son, offering them a $5 coupon. The chief's wife gives him a disapproving look and a nudge, so he instead gives the titles back to the South Park residents. Alex notes the lesson that South Park is more than just a town, but a community of people that cannot easily be split up. Stan, visibly irritated at the new kid's presence, asks him who he is, and he responds that he is Alex Glick, a fan who was granted the opportunity to do a guest voice role. Kyle tells him to leave, and Alex does so, breaking the fourth wall to say hello to his family before walking off-screen, ending the episode.\n\n\"Red Man's Greed\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"The Complete Seventh Season,\" were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season an 8/10.\n\n"}

He was born and raised in Mexico City. While he took art classes at the Academy of San Carlos, his photography is self-taught. His career spanned from the late 1920s to the 1990s with its artistic peak between the 1920s and 1950s. His hallmark as a photographer was to capture images of the ordinary but in ironic or Surrealistic ways. His early work was based on European influences, but he was soon influenced by the Mexican muralism movement and the general cultural and political push at the time to redefine Mexican identity. He rejected the picturesque, employing elements to avoid stereotyping. He had numerous exhibitions of his work, worked in the Mexican cinema and established Fondo Editorial de la Plástica Mexicana publishing house. He won numerous awards for his work, mostly after 1970. His work was recognized by the UNESCO Memory of the World registry in 2017.\n\nÁlvarez Bravo was born in Mexico City on February 4, 1902. His father was a teacher but pursued painting, photography and writing, producing several plays and his grandfather was a professional portrait maker. Because of this, Alvarez Bravo had early exposure to the medium. He grew up in the historic center of Mexico City behind the Cathedral, in one of the many former colonial buildings converted into apartments for the city's middle and lower classes. He was eight years old when the Mexican Revolution began. He could hear gunfire and came across dead bodies as a child. This would have an effect on his photography later.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1914 Alvarez Bravo attended elementary at the Patricio Saénz boarding school in Tlalpan, but he had to leave school at the age of twelve when his father died. He worked as a clerk at a French textile factory for a time, and later at the Mexican Treasury Department. He studied accounting at night for a while but then switched to classes in art at the Academy of San Carlos. Alvarez Bravo met Hugo Brehme in 1923 and bought his first camera in 1924. He began experimenting with it, with some advice from Brehme and subscriptions to photography magazines. In 1927, he met photographer Tina Modotti. Álvarez Bravo had admired Modotti's work in magazines such as Forma and Mexican Folkways even before they met. She introduced him to a number of intellectuals and artists in Mexico City, including photographer Edward Weston, who encouraged him to continue with the craft.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Alvarez Bravo married three times, with all three wives photographers in their own right. His first wife was Lola Alvarez Bravo, whom he married in 1925, just as he was beginning his career as a freelance photographer. He taught her the craft but she did not achieve the renown that he did. They had one son, Manuel and separated in 1934. His second wife was Doris Heyden and his third was French photographer Colette Álvarez Urbajtel.\n\nIn 1973 he donated his personal collection of photographs and cameras to the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. An additional 400 photographs are purchased by the Mexican government for the Museo de Arte Moderno.\n\nHe died on October 19, 2002.\n\nÁlvarez Bravo's photography career spanned from the late 1920s to the 1990s. It formed in the decades after the Mexican Revolution (1920s to 1950s) when there was significant creative output in the country, much of it sponsored by the government wanting to promote a new Mexican identity based on both modernity and the country's indigenous past.\n\nAlthough he was photographing in the late 1920s, he became a freelance photographer full-time in 1930, quitting his government job. That same year, Tina Modotti was deported from Mexico for political activities and she left Alvarez Bravo her camera and her job at Mexican Folkways magazine. For this publication, Alvarez Bravo began photographing the work of the Mexican muralists and other painters. During the rest of the 1930s, he established his career. He met photographer Paul Strand in 1933 on the set of the film \"Redes\", and worked with him briefly. In 1938, he met French Surrealist artist André Breton, who promoted Alvaréz Bravo's work in France, exhibiting it there. Later, Breton asked for a photograph for the cover of catalog for an exhibition in Mexico. Alvarez Bravo created “La buena fama durmiendo” (The good reputation sleeping), which Mexican censors rejected due to nudity. The photograph would be reproduced many times after that however.\n\nAlvarez Bravo trained most of the next generation of photographers including Nacho López, Héctor García and Graciela Iturbide. From 1938 to 1939, he taught photography at the Escuela Central de Artes Plásticas, now the National School of Arts (UNAM). In the latter half of the 1960s he taught at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1959, he worked in the Mexican film industry doing still shots, prompting him to experiment some with cinema. In 1949, he collaborated with José Revueltas in an experimental film called Coatlicue. In 1957 he worked making stills for the film Nazarín by Luis Buñuel.\n\nHis career included over 150 individual exhibitions of his work along with participation in over 200 collective exhibitions. In 1928, a photograph of his was chosen to be exhibited in the First Salón Mexciano de la Fotografía. His first individual exhibition was at the Galería Posada in Mexico City in 1932. In 1935, he exhibited with Henri Cartier-Bresson at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, with catalogue texts from Langston Hughes and Luis Cardoza y Aragón. In 1940 his work was part of a surrealist exhibition by André Breton at the gallery belonging to Inés Amor. Edward Steichen selected three of Bravo's pictures for MoMA's 1955 The Family of Man exhibition which was exhibited around the world, seen by more people than any other to date. In 1968, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a retrospective of four decades of Alvarez Bravo's work. He exhibited at the Pasadena Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1971, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington in 1978, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1983 and the National Library in Madrid in 1985. From 1994 to 1995 Evidencias de lo invisible, cien fotografías (Evidence of the Invisible, One Hundred Photographs) was presented at the Fine Arts Museum in New Delhi, the Imperial Palace in Beijing and the Belém Cultural Center in Lisbon. In 2001, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles hosted a retrospective of his work.\n\nHis first publication was in 1945, writing the book “El arte negro.” His photographs appeared in many publications over his career including the book México: pintura de hoy by Luis Cardoza y Aragón in 1964. He co wrote and provided the photographs for the book \"Instante y revelación\" along with Octavio Paz in 1982. In 1959 he founded the Fondo Editorial de la Plástica Mexicana with Leopoldo Méndez, Gabriel Figueroa, Carlos Pellicer and Rafael Carrillo which produces books on Mexican art. He spent most of the 1960s with this project, putting him in relative obscurity until the 1970s when his work was widely exhibited again.\n\nAlvarez Bravo's first significant award for his photography was first prize for an image of two lovers on a boat at the Feria Regional Ganadera in Oaxaca. In 1931, he won first prize at a competition sponsored by the La Tolteca company with an image called La Tolteca. Diego Rivera was one of the judges. The rest of his awards did not come until the 1970s. These include the Elias Sourasky Arts Prize in 1974, Premio Nacional de Arte and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975, nomination for the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in 1982, Hasselblad Award in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1984, Master of Photography Prize from the International Center of Photography in New York in 1987, Hugo Erfurth International Photography Award and the Agfa Gevaert Prize in Leverkusen, Germany in 1991, nomination as Creador Emérito by CONACULTA in 1993 and Gold Medal Award from the National Arts Club in New York along with the Leica Medal of Excellence and the Grand Cross of Merit Order in Portugal in 1995.\n\nAlvarez Bravo continued to photograph until his death. About a year before his death, when he could no longer travel, he photographed nudes. He stated that “It wasn't the sort of work one can complain about.”\n\nSignificant collections of his work exist in Mexico and the United States. The Centro Fotográfico Álvarez Bravo is a non profit association founded in 1996 by Francisco Toledo in the city of Oaxaca. It contains six halls for temporary exhibitions of his photographs as well as works by others. It has a library specializing in photography and a permanent collection of 4,000 photographs by Álvarez Bravo and other notable photographers. The other is a collection of photographs that Alvarez Bravo began putting together himself in 1980 for the Fundación Cultural Televisa. This consists of 2,294 images, custody of which is now with the Casa Lamm Cultural Center in Mexico City which built a special vault for it. Since his death the photo archive at Casa Lamm continues to receive petitions for reproductions of the photographs from both Mexico and abroad, as well as provide assistance to researchers about the photographer and the times he lived in. Outside of Mexico, two significant collections are at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena.\n\nHe was the pioneer of artistic photography in Mexico and the most important figure in Latin American photography for the 20th century. His work reached creative heights from the 1920s through the 1940s. In developing his craft, he recognized the difficulties of the photographic medium, such as the inability to capture the past and the difficulty of avoiding stereotyping.\n\nHis primary subjects were nudes, folk art and rituals, especially burials and decorations, shop windows, urban streets and everyday interactions. Although he did much of his work in Mexico City, Diego Rivera encouraged him to visit the towns and rural areas. Alvarez Bravo's photographs almost never depict trappings of political power, instead preferring subjects related to everyday life. Most of his subjects are nameless. In addition to his main subjects, he also sought out certain textures, especially the surfaces of walls and floors. One example is “Hair on Tile” featuring a long lock of wavy hair on a tile floor with star and cross designs.\n\nHe used large cameras which produced more detail in the finished print. However, he was more concerned with the images he photographed than the technical quality of his prints. The compositions were generally excellent and the images poetic. He gave titles to his photographs in order to distinguish them. The titles of his photographs often are based on Mexican myth and culture.\n\nAlvarez Bravo's early work was influenced by European Cubism, French Surrealism and abstract art. Much of this came from two books, one of Picasso and another on Japanese prints with work by Hokusai that influenced his early landscape work. However, his career was being established during the post Mexican Revolution era, when there was a cultural and political push to redefine Mexican identity. In the 1930s, he abandoned European influences for more Mexican themes and styles, influenced by the art of the Mexican muralism movement. His photographs became more complicated with ancient symbols of blood, death and religion along with the paradoxes and ambiguities of Mexican culture. His experience with death as a child as the Mexican Revolution was unfolding played a role in his photographs from the explicit “Striking Worker, Assassinated” to the more subtle “Portrait of the Eternal.” However, while Alvarez Bravo was interested in Mexico's cultural identity, he was not particularly political.\n\nAlvarez Bravo's trademark was the ability to capture hidden and surreal essences beneath the apparently ordinary images he was photographing. Alvarez Bravo was the first Mexican photographer to take a militantly anti-picturesque stand, to avoid stereotyping Mexico's variety of cultures. To avoid the picturesque, he had to present images that went against what was expected from photographs about Mexico even if photographing something classically Mexican. One way Alvarez Bravo did this was to employ a sense of irony, to the addition of an element contrary to expectations and the main focus of the photograph. For example, while photographing an indigenous man in typical clothing (Señor de Papantla 1934), the man stares defiantly back into the camera. Another was to capture people doing ordinary activities avoiding romanticism and sentimentality. One example is a photo of a mother and a shoeshine boy (La mama del bolero y el bolero 1950s) eating lunch together. Another is a group of men eating at a lunch counter (Los agachadfos 1934).\n\nAlvarez Bravo used Mexico City's streets and squares to frame statements about the social and cultural realities of the city. He used his lens to present Mexico City not in terms of moral or heroic, but rather of social relationships and material clashes. These included class and gender roles. During the 1930s and 1940s, he discovered increasingly more complex ways to frame the contradictions of Mexico's urban life into social statements. In his pictures, feminine identity has a complex symbolic range where sex overlaps with other social identities of everyday life.\n\n\n"}

In 1938, he introduced lightweight aluminum bicycle components: pedals, cranks, cantilever brakes and stems. In 1940, he began making complete bicycles. Herse was a \"constructeur\", meaning he built not just the frame but the entire bike.\n\nHis hand-built bicycles were described as \"the pinnacle of French cycling\" from the 1940s until his death.

He gave the earliest public lecture on the principles behind the laser and the maser and developed the first gravitational wave detectors (Weber bars).\n\nWeber was born in Paterson, New Jersey and attended Paterson public schools (and the Paterson Talmud Torah), graduating from the \"Mechanic Arts Course\" of Paterson Eastside High School in June 1935, just after his sixteenth birthday. He began his undergraduate education at Cooper Union, but to save his family the expense of his room and board he won admittance to the United States Naval Academy through a competitive exam. He graduated from the Academy in 1940.\n\nHe served aboard US Navy ships during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander. A memorable experience was his service on the \"Lady Lex\" USS Lexington (CV-2). Weber was the Officer of the Deck on the Lexington when the ship received word of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the Battle of the Coral Sea his carrier sank the Japanese aircraft carrier Shōhō and was in turn mortally damaged on May 8, 1942. Weber often regaled his students with the story of how the Lexington glowed incandescent as she slipped beneath the waves.\n\nLater, he commanded the sub-chaser SC-690, first in the Caribbean, and later in the Mediterranean Sea. In that role, he took part in the invasion of Sicily at Gela Beach, in July, 1943.\n\nHe studied electronics at the Naval Postgraduate School in 1943-45, and from 1945–1948, he headed electronic countermeasures design for the Navy's Bureau of Ships, in Washington, DC. He resigned from the navy as a lieutenant commander in 1948 to become a professor of engineering.\n\nIn 1948, he joined the engineering faculty of the University of Maryland, College Park. A condition of his appointment was that he should quickly attain a PhD. Thus, he did his PhD studies, on microwave spectroscopy, at night, while already a faculty member. He completed his PhD, with a thesis entitled \"Microwave Technique in Chemical Kinetics\", from The Catholic University of America in 1951. Building on his naval expertise in tube microwave engineering, during the course of his doctoral research he worked out the idea of coherent microwave emissions. He submitted a paper in 1951 for the June 1952 Electron Tube Research Conference held in Ottawa, which was the earliest public lecture on the principles behind the laser and the maser. After this presentation, RCA asked Weber to give a seminar on this idea, and Charles Hard Townes asked him for a copy of the paper. Townes was working along similar lines, as were Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov. Although Weber was jointly nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1962 and 1963 for his contributions to the development of the laser, it was Townes, Basov, and Prokhorov, the first to build working prototypes of these devices, who received the 1964 Prize, \"for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser–laser principle.\"\n\nHis interest in general relativity led Weber to use a 1955–1956 sabbatical, funded by a Guggenheim Fellowship, to study gravitational radiation with John Archibald Wheeler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ and the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. At the time, the existence of gravitational waves was not widely accepted. Weber was the first to make a real attempt to detect these waves. After he began publishing papers on the detection of gravitational waves, he moved from the Engineering department to the Physics department at Maryland.\n\nHe developed the first gravitational wave detectors (Weber bars) in the 1960s, and began publishing papers with evidence that he had detected these waves. In 1972, he sent a gravitational wave detection apparatus to the moon (the \"Lunar Surface Gravimeter\", part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package) on the Apollo 17 lunar mission.\n\nIn the 1970s, the results of these gravitational wave experiments were largely discredited, although Weber continued to argue that he had detected gravitational waves. In order to test Weber's results, IBM Physicist Richard Garwin built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's. In six months, it detected only one pulse, which was most likely noise. David Douglass, another physicist, had discovered an error in Weber's computer program that, he claimed, produced the daily gravitational wave signals that Weber claimed to have detected. Because of the error, a signal seemed to appear out of noise. Garwin aggressively confronted Weber with this information at the Fifth Cambridge Conference on Relativity at MIT in June 1974. A series of letters was then exchanged in \"Physics Today\". Garwin asserted that Weber's model was \"insane, because the universe would convert all of its energy into gravitational radiation in 50 million years or so, if one were really detecting what Joe Weber was detecting.\" \"Weber,\" Garwin declared, \"is just such a character that he has not said, 'No, I never did see a gravity wave.' And the National Science Foundation, unfortunately, which funded that work, is not man enough to clean the record, which they should.\" In 1972, Heinz Billing and colleagues at Max Planck Institute for Physics built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's to verify his claim but found no results.\n\nThe process of how physicists and the general public came to reject Weber's claims that he had found gravitational waves is described in several books and articles, including \"Gravitational Wave Blues,\" excerpted from \"Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space,\" by Janna Levin; several articles and the books \"Gravity's Shadow\" and \"Gravity's Ghost: Scientific Discovery in the 21st Century\" by sociologist Harry Collins; and \"Einstein's Unfinished Symphony\" by Marcia Bartusiak.\n\nWeber himself continued to maintain his gravitational wave detection equipment until his death.\n\nOn February 11, 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration teams held a press conference to announce that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging, on Rosh Hashanah 2015, (Weber's yahrtzeit), using the Advanced LIGO detectors.\nDuring the announcement, Weber was credited by numerous speakers as the founder of the field, including by Kip Thorne, who co-founded LIGO and also devoted much of his career to the search for gravitational waves. Later, Thorne told the Washington Post, \"He really is the founding father of this field.\"\nWeber's second wife, astronomer Virginia Trimble, was seated in the front row of the audience during the LIGO press conference. In an interview with \"Science\" afterwards, Trimble was asked if Weber really saw gravitational waves, to which she replied: \"I don't know. But I think if there had been two technologies going forward they would have pushed each other, as collaborators not as competitors, and it might have led to an observation sooner.\"\n\nIn the course of defending his work on gravitational wave detection, Weber began related work on neutrino detection. Assuming infinite crystal stiffness, Weber calculated that it could be possible to detect neutrinos using sapphire crystals, and published experimental results on neutrino scattering with these crystals. Weber also patented the idea of using vibrating crystals to generate neutrinos. His experimental results contradicted previous and subsequent findings from other experiments, but Weber's neutrino theories continue to be tested.\n\nAlthough his attempts to find gravitational waves with bar detectors are considered to have failed, Weber is widely regarded as the father of gravitational wave detection efforts, including LIGO, MiniGrail, and several HFGW research programs around the world. His notebooks contained ideas for laser interferometers; later such a detector was first constructed by his former student Robert Forward at Hughes Research Laboratories.\n\nThe Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation was named in his honor.\n\nJoseph Weber was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on 17 May 1919, the last of four children born to Yiddish-speaking immigrant parents. His name was \"Yonah\" until he entered grammar school. He had no birth certificate, and his father had taken the last name of \"Weber\" to match an available passport in order to emigrate to the US. Thus, Joe Weber had little proof of either his family or his given name, which gave him some trouble in obtaining a passport at the height of the red scare.\n\nHis first marriage, to his high school classmate Anita Straus, ended with her death in 1971. His second marriage was to astronomer Virginia Trimble. He had 4 sons (from his first marriage), and six grandchildren.\n\nJoseph Weber died on 30 September 2000 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during treatment for lymphoma that had been diagnosed about three years earlier.\n\n\n \n"}

An intervening cause will generally absolve the tortfeasor of liability for the victim's injury \"only if\" the event is deemed a \"superseding cause\". A \"superseding cause\" is an \"unforeseeable\" intervening cause. By contrast, a \"foreseeable\" intervening cause typically does \"not\" break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible for the victim's injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable result.\n\nFor example, if a defendant had carelessly spilled gasoline near a pile of cigarette butts in an alley behind a bar, the fact that a bar patron later carelessly threw a cigarette butt into the gasoline would be deemed a foreseeable intervening cause, and would not absolve the defendant of tort liability. However, if the bar patron \"intentionally\" threw the cigarette butt into the gasoline because he wanted to see it ignite, this intentional act would likely be deemed unforeseeable, and therefore superseding.\n\nIn order for the intervening cause to be deemed \"superseding\" and relieve the tortfeasor of liability, both the act/event \"and\" the injury must be \"unforeseeable\". For example, assume that contractor A was responsible for fencing or marking a hole in the ground and negligently fails to do so while contractor B is working in the hole. Then, a driver—who negligently failed to take his medication before driving and therefore does not see clearly—drives into the unmarked hole and injures contractor B. Contractor A will still be liable for the damage to contractor B despite the driver's negligence in not taking medication. This is because, even though the negligent act of the driver is not foreseeable, the fact of injury by a driver is foreseeable (i.e., a car falling in because there is no guard).\n\n\n"}

This method may have been developed to bridge the many varieties of Chinese—for example, the numbers 4 () and 10 () are hard to distinguish in some dialects. Some suggest that it was also used by business people during bargaining (i.e., to convey a bid by feeling the hand gesture in a sleeve) when they wish for more privacy in a public place. These gestures are fully integrated into Chinese Sign Language.\n\nWhile the five digits on one hand can easily express the numbers one through five, six through ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication. The gestures are rough representations of the Chinese numeral characters they represent. The system varies in practice, especially for the representation of \"7\" to \"10\". Two of the systems are listed below:\n\n\nUse of the signs corresponds to the use of numbers in the Chinese language. For instance, the sign for five just as easily means fifty. A two followed by a six, using a single hand only, could mean 260 or 2600 etc. besides twenty-six. These signs also commonly refer to days of the week, starting from Monday, as well as months of the year, whose names in Chinese are enumerations.\n\nIn different regions signs for numbers vary significantly. One may interpret the \"8\" sign as a \"7\". The \"index finger-hook\" symbol for 9, also means \"death\" in other contexts.\n\nThe numbers zero through five are simpler:\n\n\nCounting with fingers is often different from expressing a specific number with a finger gesture. When counting, the palm can be either facing its owner or the audience, depending on the purpose. Before counting, all fingers are closed; counting starts by extending the thumb as \"the first\", then the index finger as \"the second\", till all fingers are extended as \"the fifth\"; then counting can be continued by folding fingers with the same sequence, from thumb through the little finger, for counting from \"the sixth\" through \"the tenth\". Repeating the same method for counting larger numbers. One can also starts counting with all fingers extended. Some believe that for formal scenario such as giving speech or presentation, counting with the palm facing the audience and starting with all fingers extended is more polite, since the gesture of folding of fingers representing bowing.\n\nWhen playing \"drinking finger games\" (划拳, 猜拳), slightly different sets of finger gestures of numbers is used. One of them is:\n\n\nThe gesture of the digit 0 is used for showing numbers like 20, 30, 40, etc, where the left hand shows the tens digit and the right hand shows the digit 0.\n\n"}

By far the most successful among them was Samori Touré of what is now southwestern Guinea.\n\nSamori's army was well equipped with European firearms and a complex structure of permanent units. His army was divided into an infantry wing of sofa (Mandinka for infantry, usually slaves) and a cavalry wing. By 1887, Samori could field 30,000 to 35,000 infantry and about 3,000 cavalry. Infantry were divided into units of 10 to 20 men known as a \"se\" or \"kulu\". Cavalry were divided into bands of 50 horsemen called a \"sere\". Kulus were under the command of a Kun-Tigui, meaning chief. Ten kulus equaled a bolo (100–200 men). The bolo, which in the Banmana language translates to \"arm\", was strictly an infantry unit. The bolo kun-tigui commanded this unit.\n\nSamori's campaign swept first through his neighbors, the Bérété and the Cissé, and then into the Wassoulou region (the border of today's Guinea and Mali). In 1876, he secured the Buré gold mines, and by 1878, his position was secure enough to officially declare himself \"faama\" (military leader) of a new Wassoulou Empire.\n\nLater conquests included Kankan, a key Malinke trading center, and sections of what are now Sierra Leone and northern Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nFrom 1880 until his death, Samori's ambition was opposed by the expansion of the French. He entered into combat with the colonial army, defeating them on several occasions, including a notable victory on 2 April 1882, at Woyowayanko in the face of French heavy artillery.\n\nNonetheless, Samori was forced to sign several treaties ceding territory to the French between 1886 and 1889. Samori began a steady retreat, but the fall of other resistance armies, particularly Babemba Traoré at Sikasso, permitted the colonial army to launch a concentrated assault against his forces. On 29 September 1898, he was captured by the French Commandant Goudraud and exiled to Gabon, marking the end of the Wassoulou Empire.\n"}

During World War II, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was lifted briefly to allow for hemp fiber production to create ropes for the U.S. Navy but after the war hemp reverted to its de facto illegal status.\n\nThe film was made to encourage farmers to grow hemp for the war effort because other industrial fibers, often imported from overseas, were in short supply. The film shows a history of hemp and hemp products, how hemp is grown, and how hemp is processed into rope, cloth, cordage and other products.\n\nBefore 1989, the film was relatively unknown. The United States government denied ever having made such a film. The United States Department of Agriculture library and the Library of Congress told all interested parties that no such movie was made by the USDA or any branch of the U.S. government. Two VHS copies were recovered and donated to the Library of Congress on 19 May 1989 by Maria Farrow, Carl Packard, and Jack Herer.\n\nThe only known copy in 1976 was a 3/4\" broadcast quality copy of the film that was originally obtained by William Conde in 1976 from a reporter for the Miami Herald and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church of Jamaica. It was given in trust that it would be made available to as many as possible. It was put into the hands of Jack Herer by William Conde during the 1984 Oregon Marijuana Initiative. The film is now available in numerous locations on the Internet.\nIn July 1989, Jack Herer together with Chris Wright, of the Grassroots Party, attempted to obtain a copy from the National Archives where it was listed, but the curators were unable to locate the film. Subsequently, in May 1990, the founder of The Institute for Hemp, John Birrenbach, recovered a copy of the film from the National Archives. \n\nHemp for Victory was produced by the US Department of Agriculture, and contained scenes from the 1926 silent film \"Old Ironsides\". It is public domain and is freely available for download from the Internet Archive.\n\nThe film, as well as clips shown, was referenced to in an episode of \"10 Things You Don't Know About\" on marijuana and its history.\n\n\"Hemp for Victory\" is also the title of a book about hemp, published 2006 in London by Whitaker Press (). It is the work of several authors active in the hemp world, including Kenyon Gibson, Nick and Cindy Mackintosh, Woody Harrelson, Mina Hegaard and Sam Heslop.\n\nIn 2008 efforts were made to make a sequel of the movie by UK-based production houses as a series of short films. It was developed as a three film series of 60 minutes each. The first part is starred by David Hayman and Jack Herer. The second part released at the 2009 Seattle HempFest had Steve Levine and Andrea Hermann on the speaker panel. The movie did not have a full official release. It was released as a 2012 remake at select locations. The conceptualisation of the movie was based on inputs from Smithsonian Institution, Greenpeace, MardiGrass, Robert West, Dr Tapan Kumar Pradhan and Howard Marks.\n\n\n"}

It is particularly common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, Japan and northern India; it is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native American Indians and Hispanics. If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and associated lymph nodes. Most often it is found after symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other organs such as the liver.\n\nIt is a rare cancer that is thought to be related to gallstones building up, which also can lead to calcification of the gallbladder, a condition known as porcelain gallbladder. Porcelain gallbladder is also rare. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. The outlook is poor for recovery if the cancer is found after symptoms have started to occur, with a 5-year survival rate close to 3%.\n\n\nEarly symptoms mimic gallbladder inflammation due to gallstones. Later, the symptoms may be that of biliary and stomach obstruction.\n\nOf note, Courvoisier's law states that in the presence of a palpably enlarged gallbladder which is nontender and accompanied with mild painless jaundice, the cause is unlikely to be gallstones. This implicates possible malignancy of the gallbladder or pancreas, and the swelling is unlikely due to gallstones due to the chronic inflammation association with gallstones leading to a shrunken, non-distensible gallbladder. However, Ludwig Georg Courvoisier's original observations, published in Germany in 1890, were not originally cited as a law, and no mention of malignancy or pain (tenderness) was made. These points are commonly misquoted or confused in the medical literature.\n\n\nEarly diagnosis is not generally possible. People at high risk, such as women or Native Americans with gallstones, are evaluated closely. Transabdominal ultrasound, CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) can be used for diagnosis. A large number of gallbladder cancers are found incidentally in patients being evaluated for cholelithiasis, or gallstone formation, which is far more common. A biopsy is the only certain way to tell whether or not the tumorous growth is malignant.\n\nXanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare form of gallbladder disease which mimics gallbladder cancer although it is not cancerous. It was first discovered and reported in the medical literature in 1976 by J.J. McCoy, Jr., and colleagues.\n\nThe most common and most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) with part of liver and lymph node dissection. However, with gallbladder cancer's extremely poor prognosis, most patients will die within a year of surgery. If surgery is not possible, endoscopic stenting of the biliary tree can reduce jaundice and a stent in stomach may relieve vomiting. Chemotherapy and radiation may also be used with surgery. If gallbladder cancer is diagnosed after cholecystectomy for stone disease (incidental cancer), re-operation to remove part of liver and lymph nodes is required in most cases. When it is done as early as possible, patients have the best chance of long-term survival and even cure.\n\nMost tumors are adenocarcinomas, with a small percent being squamous cell carcinomas.\n\n\nThe prognosis still remains poor. The cancer commonly spreads to the liver, bile duct, stomach, and duodenum.\n\n"}

Born in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy on 12 August 1923 to an unknown father, Green grew up in Essendon. Torn between becoming an architect or a cartoonist after leaving Essendon High School, he studied architecture at the Melbourne Technical College because his mother warned: \"You'll starve if you're a cartoonist.\"\n\nAt the age of 18 he enlisted in the Australian Army, and was attached to the 15th Brigade Army Intelligence in New Guinea. He drew cartoons that were published in the army's newspaper. Following his discharge from the army at the end of World War II, Green resumed his architectural studies but he abandoned architecture in favour of a postwar rehabilitation art course at the National Gallery of Victoria, where his tutors included Sir William Dargie. During this time he submitted cartoons to \"The Herald\". When the paper's political cartoonist, Sammy Wells, went on holiday for six weeks in 1946, Green was asked to fill in for him. His work appealed to the editor-in-chief, John Williams, and in 1947 he was invited to join \"The Herald\" staff permanently. He continued to be a political cartoonist for the paper until he retired in 1986, after 40 years in that role. Green was responsible for introducing the daily \"pocket\" cartoon, Weg's Day, a single column topical comment humorously presented, that appeared for the first time in 1949 and continued on the paper's front page for 38 years.\n\nOn 14 May 1949, Green married Joan Hettie Currell in Milton, Queensland.\n\nGreen continued working as a caricaturist and illustrator, with his work appearing in cricket books by Max Walker, on stamps and in children's books.\n\nIn the 1954 VFL season, Green began drawing premiership posters of the winning teams of the Victorian Football League (VFL) Grand Final for the \"Weekend Herald\". By 1966, Green's posters had become so popular that \"The Herald\" started producing and selling them after the grand final. The posters, generally featuring a caricature of the winning club's mascot smiling gleefully, continued to sell around 100,000 copies each year. Although the series started in 1954, Green produced posters for all the grand finals back to 1897 to satisfy collectors. An exhibition of all 55 of Green's original posters was staged at the National Sports Museum in 2009. The tradition continued after Green's death, with \"Herald Sun\" cartoonist Mark Knight taking over as the illustrator of the posters from 2009. The family of the late cartoonist release a grand final poster every year in his memory from artwork supply by Green before he died. He told family that he wanted his posters to go on after he was gone. His private company, Weg Art, supplies the posters each year.\n\nOn 14 January 2005, the 82-year-old Green confronted a burglar running through his back yard in Heathmont, Victoria. After confronting the man, Green called the police and then proceeded to take pen to paper and produce a caricature. His art was immediately recognisable to the local police. The offender was soon apprehended at a local shop as the cartoon clearly showed the man responsible. \n\nGreen died on 29 December 2008 at the Maroondah Hospital; he was survived by his wife Joan, daughter Lynette and son Ian.\n\nIn June 2001, Green received the Medal of the Order of Australia \"for service to art as a cartoonist and illustrator, and to the community, particularly through the Good Friday Appeal of the Royal Children's Hospital.\"\n\nIn 2003 he received the Jim Russell Award from the Australian Cartoonists' Association in acknowledgement of his lifelong contribution to the profession of cartooning.\n\nIn 2009 the Melbourne Press Club posthumously bestowed on him the Quill Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\n"}

He came to power as a child under his regent mother Zenobia, who led a revolt against the Roman Empire and formed the independent Palmyrene Empire.\n\nLucius Julius Aurelius Septimius Vaballathus was born and raised in the city of Palmyra, an oasis settlement in the Syrian Desert in 259 to the king of kings of Palmyra, Odaenathus, and his second wife, queen consort of Palmyra, Zenobia. Vaballathus is the Latinized form of his Palmyrene name, \"Wahballāt\", \"Gift of Allāt\". As the Arabian goddess Allāt came to be identified with Athena, he used \"Athenodorus\" as the Greek form of his name. He had a half-brother, Hairan I, born from his father and another woman, who reigned as co-king of kings with his father, and a lesser-known brother, Hairan II. He also might have had other brothers, who were mentioned in (and only known from) the \"Augustan History\", Herennianus and Timolaus. Herennianus may be Hairan; while Timolaus is probably a fabrication.\n\nIn 267, his father Odaenathus and half-brother Hairan I were murdered by a relative, perhaps a cousin of Odaenthus's, named Maeonius. Maeonius ruled as a usurper and crowned himself emperor but was almost immediately killed, as no inscription or evidence for his rule exists. With Odaenathus and his oldest son dead, the succession came to his younger son, Vaballathus. The young Vaballathus was made king (\"rex consul imperator dux Romanorum\", \"illustrious King of Kings\" and \"corrector totius orientis\") of the Palmyrene Empire at eight years old. Being too young to rule, his mother Zenobia ruled as queen regent and was the \"de facto\" ruler of Palmyra.\n\nInitially the Roman emperor Aurelian recognized Vaballathus' rule, perhaps because he was engaged in conflict with the Gallic Empire in the west and hesitated to incite open warfare with the Palmyrene Empire. This mutual recognition is testified by early coins issued by Zenobia under Vaballathus's name, but also acknowledging Aurelian as emperor. In the coins, Aurelian is shown wearing a radiate crown that signifies his supremacy as emperor, and Vaballathus was crowned with a laurel wreath. The Alexandrian minted coins showed Aurelian in his first year and Vaballathus in his fourth year with Vaballathus adopting honorary titles possibly inherited from his father Odaenathus. Although the Palmyrene Empire was centred in Palmyra, Vaballathus and Zenobia probably spent most of their reign in Antioch, Syria's administrative capital. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the newly established Palmyrene empire deteriorated, and a series of Palmyrene conquests, done under the protective show of subordination to Rome, began around 270.\n\nIn October of 270, a Palmyrene army of 70,000 invaded Egypt, and declared Zenobia, Vaballathus's mother, the Queen of Egypt. The Roman general Tenagino Probus was able to regain Alexandria in November, but was defeated and escaped to the fortress of Babylon, where he was besieged and killed by Zabdas, a Palmyrene general, who continued his march south and secured Egypt. Afterward, in 271, Zabbai, another Palmyrene general serving Zenobia, started the operations in Anatolia, and was joined by Zabdas in the spring of that year. The Palmyrenes subdued the Asian province of Galatia, and occupied the regional capital of Ancyra, marking the greatest extent of the Palmyrene expansion.\n\nAurelian disappeared from Palmyrene coinage, while Zenobia and Vaballathus adopted the titles of \"Augusta\" and \"Augustus\", respectively. Vaballathus was named in coins \"King, Emperor, \"Dux Romanum\" leader of the Romans\" and an open rebellion against Rome started.\n\nIn 272, the Emperor Aurelian crossed the Bosporus and advanced quickly through Anatolia. While the Roman general Marcus Aurelius Probus regained Egypt from Palmyra, the emperor continued his march and reached Tyana. Tyana fell from Palmyrene control; Aurelian up to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him, but he allegedly spared Tyana. Whatever the reason for his clemency, it paid off, as many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the emperor would not exact revenge upon them.\n\nPassing through Issus, Aurelian defeated Zenobia in the Battle of Immae near Antioch. The Palmyrene armies retreated to Antioch, then later Emesa, while Aurelian advanced and took the former. The defeat at Emesa forced the Palmyrene armies to evacuate to the capital. The Romans began a siege, and tried to breach the city defences several times but were repelled, however, the situation worsened, so Zenobia, Vaballathus's mother, left the city and headed east to ask the Sasanian Empire for help. The Romans followed the queen, arrested her near the Euphrates, and brought her back to the emperor. Soon after, the Palmyrene citizens asked for peace, and the city fell.\n\nThe end of Vaballathus's nominal rule came after losing the Siege of Palmyra. Vaballathus, his mother and her council were taken to Emesa and put on trial. Most of the high-ranking Palmyrene officials were executed, while Zenobia and Vaballathus's fates remain uncertain. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he most likely spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.\n\nAccording to Zosimus, Vaballathus died on the way to Rome, but this theory has been neither confirmed nor disproved. Other sources have implied that after shipping the defeated Zenobia and Vaballathus to Rome, Aurelian allowed both of the rebels to live, but only after they had been marched through the streets of the imperial city in accordance with Roman traditions of celebrating military victories with a triumphal procession. This would have been humiliating, but better than death. This theory is supported by Aurelian's similar treatment of the Tetrici, Tetricus I and Tetricus II of the Gallic Empire, long-time enemies of Rome whom the emperor allowed to retire following their defeat at the Battle of Châlons in 274.\n\nThe fate of Palmyra, however took a turn for the worse. In 273, a revolution was started by Septimius Apsaios declaring a relative of Zenobia, Septimius Antiochus, as \"Augustus\". Aurelian marched to Palmyra, razing it. Buildings were smashed, citizens clubbed and massacred and Palmyra's holiest temples pillaged. The city was reduced and disappeared from historical records from that time, thus ending the ascendancy of Palmyra over Roman Asia Minor.\n\n\n"}

Fill-Ins are common in puzzle magazines along with word searches, cryptograms, and other logic puzzles. Some consider Fill-Ins to be an easier version of the crossword. Since the Fill-In requires no outside knowledge of specific subjects, one can solve the puzzle in another language.\n\nSolving a Fill-In usually requires trial-and-error. Many times, a first word is already given to help the solver start, but some difficult puzzles require the solver to begin from scratch without any help. Word entries are listed alphabetically by number of letters.\n\nThe solver is given a grid and a list of words. To solve the puzzle correctly, the solver must find a solution that fits all of the available words into the grid. Generally, these words are listed by number of letters, and further alphabetically. Many times, one word is filled in for the solver to help him or her begin the game.\n\nSolving a Fill-In typically amounts to searching for words of a certain length with letters in specific places. If a starter word is given in the grid, it is often useful to use it as the beginning search point. Raw \"trial and error\" is best used when there are only two or three words that can potentially fit at a given location; temporarily assume one of the words, and see if an impossible letter combination results. If so, that word is not the one that should go in the grid at that location. Smaller words may be easier to fit in the grid, but longer words give more clues to connecting words.\n\nCare must be given to marking out words that are not explicitly placed in the grid; this occurs when one fills in a vertical sequence of horizontal words, or vice versa. Forgetting to do this results in \"extra words\" and often makes the puzzle more difficult to solve.\n\nA common variation on the standard Fill-In is using numbers, instead of specific words, sometimes called \"cross numbers\". In this puzzle, the entries could be listed as the number, a mathematical expression, or even an important year. \n\nA more complex variation on the Fill-In is the \"diagramless\" Fill-In, where the grid is initially empty. Another variation is having no words listed at all, but gathering them from a known group of words, such as the fifty American states.\n"}

She is a primary character in \"\" and \"Conviction\".\n\nCabot first appears in the \"SVU\" episode \"Wrong Is Right\", when she is hired to work with SVU as their permanent assistant district attorney (ADA) overseeing the legality of its arrests, following a rotating mix of ADAs, among them Abbie Carmichael (Angie Harmon) of the original \"Law & Order\". She is a graduate of Harvard Law School, and has an \"uncle Bill\" who is a federal judge. While Cabot has great compassion for the victims of sexual assault, child sexual abuse and domestic violence whom she advocates for, her strict code of legal ethics often forces her to make harsh decisions and judgments that go against her personal feelings. Her moral compass has earned her respect within the SVU squad.\n\nShe does occasionally bend the rules to suit her own notions of justice, but often with unpleasant results. In one case, she is so determined to put serial child molester Roy Barnett (Beau Gravitte) in prison that she aggressively pressures one of his victims, Sam Cavanaugh (Bret Harrison) to testify, going so far as to threaten the boy with legal action if he does not comply. Sam later attempts suicide, leaving him with severe brain damage and thus unable to testify. She then lies to the detectives about having a search warrant for Sam’s home, which results in Barnett’s conviction on a technicality, but gets her in trouble with her superiors. She is let off with a one-month suspension, but feels responsible for Sam’s plight.\n\nExecutive producer and head writer Neal Baer has said that an unaddressed sexual tension exists between Cabot and Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay). Baer said, \"We read the fan sites. We know that people are into the Alex-Olivia thing. All the codes are in there.\" When asked in a 2009 press call if Cabot and Benson were in love, March said, \"I’m not saying we’re not…I’m not saying we’re not in love.\"\n\nAfter three seasons, Cabot made her departure from SVU in the season-five episode \"Loss\", in which she is prosecuting a rapist named Rafael Zapata Gaviria (Jacinto Taras Riddick), who works for drug lord Cesar Velez. Zapata had brutally raped and murdered an undercover NYPD officer who was working with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Cabot receives a threat on her life, as well as that of her mother. Despite warnings from the rest of the SVU squad, Cabot continues to prosecute the case, unwilling to let Zapata scare her. Tim Donovan (Josh Hopkins), a key witness and DEA special agent, is murdered in a car bombing right before Cabot's eyes. Cabot initially wants to try Zapata, even with no witness and her own life on the line, but after pressuring from the SVU detectives and District Attorney Arthur Branch (Fred Thompson), she drops the charges. However, Zapata is immediately arrested by federal agents for the witness's murder and is subsequently killed in his cell.\n\nAt the conclusion of the episode, Cabot is apparently killed in a drive-by shooting while saying goodnight to Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). In the following scene, a cold, quiet SVU squad room is shown with Stabler reading a newspaper proclaiming her death. Benson and Stabler are called to a deserted area by federal agents, where Cabot emerges from the car. She tells the stunned detectives that she had insisted on telling them the truth before disappearing into the Witness Protection Program. She is replaced in the following episode by ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal).\n\nIn the season-six episode \"\", events surrounding the arrest of Liam Connors (Brian F. O'Byrne), the assassin who shot her, led to Cabot's return from the Witness Protection Program as Connors is arrested for her murder while being pursued for several others and an attempted murder of a young boy who witnessed one of his crimes. She reveals that the assumed identity she was given was an insurance salesperson from Tulsa, that she was living and working in Wisconsin under the name \"Emily\", and that she missed her mother's funeral while in hiding. She is reluctant to see Connors convicted of a murder he did not commit (he does not know she is alive, either), but still wants justice and testifies against him in court. Connors goes to prison, having been found guilty under two counts of attempted murder (Cabot and an eight-year-old boy), plus five counts of murder. Upon winning the case, the SVU squad goes to Novak's office to celebrate, awaiting Cabot to join them. She does not show up, and federal agents inform them that she has once again been moved and given a new identity.\n\nAbout a year after her reappearance on \"SVU\", Cabot returns to New York and resumes her work in the district attorney's office as the homicide bureau chief (replacing Tracey Kibre from \"\") in the \"Law & Order\" spinoff \"Conviction\". She plays a tough but understanding supervisor to a young group of ADAs. Her attitude and personality in this role were much different from those of the young ADA who prosecuted cases in \"SVU\". Cabot's departure from witness protection and return to New York as a bureau chief was not explained during the show's airing, as she was a last-minute addition to the cast and most of the early episodes had already been written before she was added. Plans were made for later episodes to explain Cabot's return to New York, plus a greater exploration of her personal life and past, but the cancellation of \"Conviction\" made this moot.\n\nThe explanation of Cabot's return from witness protection to the DA's office in \"Conviction\" was finally revealed in the \"SVU\" season-10 episode, \"\", where she reveals to the SVU detectives that she has been asked by DA Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) to step in for Kim Greylek (Michaela McManus), when Greylek was called back to the Justice Department. At that point, she had not told her former colleagues of her return; she is implied, and later confirmed, to be still traumatized by her attempted murder. The detectives learn she had left witness protection after Velez died in prison and Connors was extradited to Ireland. Sometime between 2006 and 2007, she stepped down from the position of homicide bureau chief and is replaced by Christine Danielson (Gloria Reuben). Cabot begins work in the Appeals Bureau until her return to SVU. She remains at SVU for the remainder of the season, in which she appears in six episodes in what Cabot calls a \"temporary\" role. She replaces Greylek.\n\nIn the season-11 premiere, Cabot is revealed to be training in Albany, and will eventually return to the Appeals Bureau. McCoy asks Executive ADA Sonya Paxton (Christine Lahti) to assume Cabot's role. Paxton is ultimately fired for showing up to trial drunk, and Cabot returns to her old job, commenting that she had \"clawed her way\" out of Appeals to return to SVU, to prosecute Kevin O’Donnell (Garret Dillahunt), the leader of a pedophile advocacy group. In this episode, Stephanie March is added to the season-11 opening credits as a series regular (though only in episodes in which she appears). Benson and Stabler are later informed that Cabot had been accused of withholding evidence and is being investigated by the state bar association. In that same episode, Paxton returns to give Cabot some \"much needed advice\" that helps her win the case.\n\nIn another episode, Cabot tries a rape case with an illegal immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo as her star witness. The witness was herself raped in the Congo, and Cabot works to help her get asylum, as well as trying the rape case, which then becomes a murder case after the victim dies from an infection caused by injuries sustained during the rape. Cabot succeeds in getting the rapist convicted and gets the witness a visa that would allow her to remain in the United States without fear of being deported. However, the case affects both the witness and Cabot; the witness decides to return to the Congo to help rape victims there, while Cabot decides to take a leave of absence and joins the prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes sex crimes and other human-rights abuses in areas such as the Congo. She is replaced by (Sharon Stone).\n\nADAs Alexandra Cabot and Casey Novak both returned to \"\" for the show's 13th season. In the season premiere \"\", Cabot makes her first appearance in the squad room since season 11. She is the lead prosecutor in a rape case against Roberto DiStasio (Franco Nero), a diplomat in the running to become Italy's next prime minister. When the accuser, a hotel maid, is caught on tape admitting she could make money off her alleged rapist, Cabot's new boss, SVU's Bureau Chief ADA Michael Cutter (Linus Roache), says that they are dropping the charges. Cabot fights Cutter, however, and the case does make it to trial, with mixed results; the jury finds the defendant guilty of unlawful imprisonment, but are deadlocked on the rape charge.\n\nIn the episode \"Spiraling Down\", Cabot is convinced by the detectives to set up a sting operation to catch johns after they rescue an underaged prostitute. They arrest former professional quarterback Jake Stanton (Treat Williams), and both Cabot and Benson seek to make an example out of him, but Cabot is unexpectedly forced to face off with defense attorney Bayard Ellis (Andre Braugher) at trial, after Benson tells Stanton's wife to call him. After the case takes a turn for the worse, Cabot berates Benson after court when Benson defends Stanton. Cabot implies she knows Benson had something to do with Ellis defending Stanton. Cabot ultimately loses the case after the jury finds Stanton not guilty due to mental instability caused by the numerous concussions he suffered during his career.\n\nCabot is the prosecutor in seven episodes of season 13, sharing the ADA duties with Novak, Cutter, and David Haden (Harry Connick Jr.). The character makes her final appearance in the season in \"Learning Curve\", in which she helps the investigation of sexual abuse in an exclusive preparatory school.\n\nCabot returns six years later in the Season 19 episode, \"Sunk Cost Fallacy\". At this point, she has retired from the D.A.'s office, and now helps battered women escape their abusers by “disappearing” them - smuggling them out of New York City and giving them new identities.\n\nIn SVU's latest case, a woman named Jules Hunter (Sarah Wilson) and her four-year-old daughter Ruby have gone missing, and the detectives find evidence of their apparent murders in Jules' car. They arrest their chief suspect, Jules’ abusive husband Nick (Scott Porter). However, now-Lieutenant Benson discovers that Cabot had faked Jules’ and Ruby’s deaths in order to help them escape their abusive home and start new lives.\n\nBenson is forced to reduce the charges against Nick to assault, and he makes bail. He then sues the department and the D.A's office for $50 million. During the resulting bench trial, Nick’s lawyer calls Benson as a witness and gets her to reveal that Jules and Ruby are alive. Cabot tries to hide them again, but Benson persuades Jules to stay and help put Nick in prison. Soon afterward, however, Jules is killed in an apparent car accident. Both Cabot and Benson believe that Nick is responsible, but he nevertheless wins custody of Ruby. Though now on opposite sides, Cabot and Benson part ways on good terms; they express admiration for each other and hug. Cabot then goes to meet another client.\n\nMarch has been credited in 97 episodes of \"SVU\" (appearing in 93), making her the third-longest ADA in the franchise history, surpassed by Casey Novak (\"SVU\"), and Ron Carver (\"\"). Additionally, she is credited in all 13 episodes of \"Conviction\", bringing her total episode count to 110.\n"}

The eastern terminus of State Route 568 is in downtown Carey at a signalized intersection that serves as all of the northern split of the U.S. Route 23/State Route 103 concurrency, the western split of the State Route 103/State Route 199 concurrency and the southern split of the U.S. Route 23/State Route 199 concurrency.\n\nState Route 568 was created in the middle of the 1960s.

There are no segments of State Route 568 that are incorporated within the National Highway System, a network of highways deemed most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country.\n\nState Route 568 was established in 1965. With the completion of a new four-lane divided expressway from Interstate 75 south of Findlay and U.S. Route 23/State Route 103 south of Carey, the State Route 15 designation, which had utilized a two-lane roadway between downtown Findlay and downtown Carey to that point, was transferred onto the new expressway, which parallels the two-lane road to the south. Consequently, this two-lane highway became known as State Route 568. The route has utilized the same alignment from inception to this day, and has not seen any significant changes since its original designation.\n\nPrior to the presently designated Route 568, a previous Route 568 traversed northern Lucas County and Fulton County, Ohio.

However, within a year, the part west of old U.S. 223 (present day Monroe Street and Alexis Road in Sylvania) was renamed Route 120. Subsequently only the portion east of Monroe Street remained as Route 568, entirely encompassing Alexis Road. It was decommissioned as a state route before 1953.\n"}

{"id": "2191618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191618", "title": "Eendracht (1615)", "text": "Eendracht (1615)\n\nThe Eendracht (; Concord) was an early 17th Century Dutch wooden-hulled 700 tonne East Indiaman, launched in 1615 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). It was captained by Dirk Hartog when he made the second recorded landfall by a European on Australian soil, in 1616.\n\nIts name in Dutch literally means 'carrying (as) one' meaning together or in concord, but is also translated as \"unity\" or \"union\", and was a common name given to Dutch ships of the period, from the motto of the Republic: \"Concordia res parvae crescunt\".\n\nUpon its commissioning, the \"Eendracht\" entered the service of the Dutch East India Company (\"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\", or VOC).\n\nFor her maiden voyage on the open ocean, the \"Eendracht\" set sail on 23 January 1616 from the Dutch port of Texel in the company of several other VOC ships, on a trading venture bound for Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (the present-day Jakarta). Her captain was Dirk Hartog, a thirty-five-year-old former private merchant, who had sailed for the VOC before but was now again in the employ of the VOC.\n\nSailing down the west Africa coastline, the \"Eendracht\" became separated from the others in a horrible storm and reached the Cape of Good Hope alone around August. She stayed there until 27 August when Hartog decided to set out unaccompanied across the Indian Ocean towards their destination.\n\nHartog's course across the Indian Ocean was a much more southerly one than the route usually followed. It made use of the prevailing westerly winds at those latitudes known as the \"Roaring Forties\", a route which had been pioneered a few years earlier by the Dutch navigator Hendrik Brouwer, who had noted it to be a faster way to reach Java. By this time, the VOC had not as yet instructed all its captains to take advantage of this route, which could reduce the overall traveling time from Europe by a good six months. The decision to do so was taken just a few months after Hartog departed Amsterdam. So Hartog took that decision himself. However, later the intention was to change heading northwards at a more westerly longitude than the \"Eendracht\" had done. Whether Hartog had intended to maintain such a southerly course for so long via this route, or was perhaps blown a little off course, is unclear.\n\nAfter approximately two months at sea, on 25 October Hartog and the \"Eendracht\" unexpectedly sighted land\"various islands, which were, however, found uninhabited\", at a latitude around 26° South. These islands and the nearby land were previously unknown to Europeans, and the \"Eendracht\" had become the second recorded European ship to visit the continent of Australia, having been preceded (albeit, on the opposite side of the continent) 10 years earlier by Willem Janszoon on the sailing along, and (briefly) landing on, the western shores of the Cape York Peninsula. Luis Vas de Torres is also reported to have mapped a portion of the west coast of Cape York in 1606 without knowing it was the great south land and ships logs suggests a landing where the natives were 'friendly'unlike many of the natives of New Guinea.\n\nHartog and crew made landfall on the island, now known as Dirk Hartog Island which lies off Shark Bay in Western Australia. This was the first recorded landing on the western coastline by a European. The island was uninhabited, and Hartog spent three days there, finding nothing of great interest or value to him or his company. \n\nBefore departing on 27 October, Hartog left behind a pewter dish affixed to a post set in a rock cleft (now called Cape Inscription), upon which he had inscribed the following brief account of his visit:\n1616 On 25 October arrived the ship Eendracht, of Amsterdam: Supercargo Gilles Miebais of Liege, skipper Dirch Hatichs of Amsterdam. on 27 d[itt]o. she set sail again for Bantam. Deputy supercargo Jan Stins, upper steersman Pieter Doores of Bil. In the year 1616.\nThis object, now known as the Hartog Plate, measuring in diameter, is the oldest known written artifact from Australia's European history. It lay unmolested \"in situ\" for a further eighty years, until it was re-discovered half-buried (the post had rotted away) by a Dutch expedition of three ships under the command of the Flemish captain Willem de Vlamingh in 1697. De Vlamingh had earlier explored Rottnest Island and the Swan River (later to be the site of the city of Perth), and had been making his way up the western coast of Australia. He replaced the Hartog dish with one of his own, onto which he copied Hartog's original inscription and added an account of his own landing, installing it in the same spot nailed to a cypress-pine trunk taken from Rottnest. Hartog's original dish returned with De Vlamingh later to Amsterdam, where it is displayed in the Rijksmuseum.\n\nAfter leaving the island, the \"Eendracht\" sailed in a north-west direction along the West Australian coastline, Hartog charting as he went. He gave this land the name \"t'Landt van d'Eendracht\" or \"Eendrachtsland\", after his ship.\n\nIn 1627 this name appeared on the Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht and on subsequent charts, replacing the former mythical and postulated land of \"Terra Australis Incognita\" (South Land), sparking considerable further interest by parties such as the Dutch East India Company. This gave further impetus to explore this region in the hope of something notable or exploitable, leading to a long period of further exploration where Hartog's name Eendrachtsland was at first being retained for just the art he visited, when the continent he was then thought to have visited was named \"Nova Hollandia (New Holland)\" by Abel Tasman in 1644 when further unveiled by him on two expeditions during the previous two years.\n\nHartog himself did not note anything which might be of use, making no further landfalls or contact with the Australian Aborigine inhabitants of the land. The \"Eendracht\" continued along the coast to about 22° South latitude, thereafter heading northwards toward the Timor Sea. She arrived first at Makassar on the island of Sulawesi on 14 December 1616 where a conflict with the local chief, caused the ship to leave for Ambon where it arrived 6 days later. \nSome excerpts of a letter from Supercargo, Cornelis Buysero at Bantam to the Managers of the East India Company at Amsterdam, with comments from author, Jan Heeres in 1899, is of interest to the history of the \"Eendracht\", as follows.\nWorshipful, Wise, Provident, very Discreet Gentlemen...\n...The ship Eendracht [*], with which they had sailed from the\nNetherlands, after communicating at the Cabo sailed away from them so\nfar southward as to come upon 6 various islands which were, however,\nfound uninhabited [**]...\n[* Commanded by Dirk Hartogs, or Hartogszoon.]\n[* What \"uninhabited islands\" the ship Eendracht \"came upon\", Buysero's\nletter does not say. Various authentic archival documents of 1618 and\nsubsequent years, however, go to show that the land afterwards named\nEendrachtsland or Land van de Eendracht, and the Dirk Hartogsreede\n(island) must have been discovered on this voyage.]\nBantam, this last day of August, A.D. 1617.\nYour Worships' servant to command\nCORNELIS BUYSERO [*]\n[* Buysero was supercargo at Bantam (DE JONGE, Opkcornst, IV, p. 68,) and\nwas therefore likely to be well informed as to the adventures of the\nship, which had sailed from the Netherlands in January 1616, departed\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope in the last days of August, and had arrived in\nIndia in December of the same year, as appears from what Steven Van der\nHaghen, Governor of Amboyna, writes May 26, 1617: \"That in the month of\nDecember 1616, the ship Eendracht entered the narrows between Bima and\nthe land of Endea near Guno Api (Goenoeng Api) in the south of Java\"\n(Sapi Straits).]\nIt proves that as early as 1618 the name of Eendrachtsland was known in\nthe Netherlands.\n\nThe Willems River discovery added to the boundary of Eendrachtsland in 1618, as shown by the prominence given to Eendrachtsland as the main name on the chart as the name for this South-land. It names the as the ship used for the discovery of the Willems River. The text on this close-up cropped image says, Willems revier, besocht by 't volck van 't Schip Mauritius in Iulius A° 1618 (\"Willem's River, visited by the crew of the ship Mauritius in July 1618\").\n\nThe \"Eendracht\" remained in the East Indies for about a year, possibly engaging in local commercial ventures.\n\nOn 17 December 1617 she again set sail for the return voyage home, leaving the port of Bantam and bound for Zeeland in the Dutch Republic, with Dirk Hartog again as her master. This voyage proved to be relatively uneventful, and she arrived back in the Netherlands on 16 October 1618 after a period of some ten months at sea. Captain Hartog left the service of the VOC shortly after the return, to resume private trading ventures in the Baltic. He died a few years later.\n\nOn 13 May 1619 the \"Eendracht\" again left port at Texel, bound a second time for Batavia and the East Indies. She rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 26 November, and reached her destination on 22 March 1620 without recorded incident, a journey of some ten months.\n\nShe apparently remained in the East Indies, until 13 May 1622, where on a local trading voyage she is recorded as having been wrecked and lost off the western coast of Ambon Island in the central Moluccas. She had aboard a cargo of coins, and her wreck has not been recovered.\n\n"}

As with gallstone disease in general, this condition occurs predominantly in overweight female patients of middle age. It is a morphological variant of chronic cholecystitis. Inflammatory scarring of the wall, combined with dystrophic calcification within the wall transforms the gallbladder into a porcelain-like vessel. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the recommended treatment.\n\nSymptoms are similar to gallstones and can include abdominal pain (especially after eating), jaundice, and vomiting. Porcelain gallbladder can also be asymptomatic and discovered on imaging obtained for a different reason.\n\nThe assertion that porcelain gallbladder increases the incidence of gallbladder cancer is widely taught in medical schools but is based on studies from 1931 and 1962. A prominent study aid for surgical residents even states that the risk of cancer in a porcelain gallbladder is 15%. The precise nature of the association between gallbladder cancer and porcelain gallbladder is uncertain. Two articles published in 2001 examined the association between cancer of the gallbladder and calcified gallbladder. The first study reviewed 10,741 cholecystectomies and found that the 88 patients with gallbladder cancer did not have calcified gallbladders while the 15 patients with porcelain gallbladders did not have gallbladder cancer. The second study reviewed 25,900 gallbladder specimens and found 150 patients with cancer and 44 patients with calcified gallbladders of two types (intramural calcification and selective mucosal calcification). The selective mucosal calcification group showed a 7% incidence of cancer with a significant odds ratio of 13.89.\n\nAn article published in 2013 reviewed 111 studies and found 340 patients with gallbladder wall calcification showed a 21% overall rate of gallbladder malignancy; however, when studies with obvious selection bias were excluded the rate of gallbladder malignancy fell to 6%. Comparatively, a matched cohort without gallbladder calcification showed a 1% rate of gallbladder malignancy.\n\nAbdominal radiography (X-ray), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.\n\nDue to the increased risk for gallbladder cancer, the recommended treatment is cholecystectomy which usually includes pre-operative or intra-operative imaging of the biliary tree. Cholecystectomy may be performed via an open incision or via laparoscopic methods, but gallbladder anatomy and consistency may complicate the operation.\n\nBased on evidence in the current literature, a prophylactic cholecystectomy is not routinely recommended for all patients with porcelain gallbladder and should be restricted to those with conventional indications, such as young patients\n\n"}

The object of the game is to assemble molecules from compound atoms by moving the atoms on a two-dimensional playfield.\n\n\"Atomix\" was received positively; reviewers noted the game's addictiveness and enjoyable gameplay, though criticized its repetitiveness.\n\n\"Atomix\" takes place on a playfield, consisting of a number of walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms; more specifically, the atoms must be arranged into a specific shape, identical with the shape of the molecule displayed on the left side of the screen. The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions; however, a moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits a wall or another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule can be a problem. Once the molecule is assembled, the player receives a score; the faster the puzzle is completed, the more score is given.\n\nEach puzzle must be completed within a time limit; otherwise the game ends, though the player can spend some of his score to restart the failed puzzle instead. The entire game consists of 30 puzzles of increasing difficulty. In addition, after every five puzzles, there is a bonus level where the player must move laboratory flasks filled with various amounts of liquid to arrange them from empty to full.\n\nThe game also offers a two-player mode, where two players are working on the same puzzle; they take turns which last up to thirty seconds.\n\n\nAmiga Format reviewed a pre-release version in its May, 1990 issue. It was almost a complete version of the game although it lacked sound.\n\nInitially the game was released for Amiga, Atari ST and the IBM PC; as of May 1990, the C64 version was not yet planned, and was only released a few months later. A ZX Spectrum version was also planned. It was to be distributed by U.S. Gold, but was never released.\n\nThe game was published for Enterprise 128 in 2006, this version was written by Zoltán Povázsay from Hungary.\n\nA clone for the Atari Jaguar called Atomic has been released in 2006, written by Sébastien Briais (AKA Seb from the Removers). A second version called Atomic Reloaded has been released in 2009.\n\n\"Atomix\" received warm reactions from reviewers. They stated it was highly enjoyable and addictive despite its high difficulty level. Reviewers also pointed out the possible educational application of the game.\n\nHowever, certain reviewers criticized the game for its repetitiveness and stated that it lacked replayability. Some reviewers also wrote about the game's unoriginality, noting similarities to earlier games, Xor and Leonardo.\n\nGraphics were generally considered adequate, though not spectacular; Zzap!64 called them \"a bit dull and repetitive\" and \"simplistic, but slick and effective\", while CU Amiga remarked that despite their simplicity, they \"create a nice, tidy display\". The soundtrack was found enjoyable, though the Commodore Format reviewer considered it annoyingly repetitive.\n\n\"Atomix\" has been the subject of scientific research in computational complexity theory. When generalized to puzzles of arbitrary sizes, the problem of determining whether an Atomix puzzle has a solution is PSPACE-complete. Some heuristic approaches have been considered.\n\n"}

He was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and was elected an officer of Cambridge University Students’ Union.\n\nFrom 1977–80, he worked for the investment banks Lehman Brothers and Lazard Frères in New York, training as an investment banker, and qualified as a barrister in 1976, becoming a member of Gray's Inn. He was seconded to the British Steel Corporation to work with Sir Ian MacGregor. He was appointed Managing director of British Steel Service Centres Ltd and later appointed Commercial Director British Steel, establishing joint ventures in China, Turkey, Europe and North America. After British Steel, he managed a number of private steel and manufacturing businesses.\n\nHe was elected as MP for North Norfolk in 1997 and he became Chief Executive of the Conservative Party and its deputy chairman and a member of the trade and industry select committee. In 2002 he was appointed chairman of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust, resigning in November 2006. He was acting chairman of the Conservative Party in 2001.\n\nOn 14 November 2006, he was arrested, among others, by Norfolk Constabulary investigating allegations of financial irregularities at Cawston Park Hospital previously known as Cawston College, a private psychiatric hospital in Cawston, Norfolk.

The southern terminus of SR 330 is at a diamond interchange with the SR 15 expressway just south of the village limits of Vanlue. Its northern terminus is at SR 568 nearly north of Vanlue.\n\nThis two-lane state route was created in the early 1930s, generally along its present routing. From the late 1930s until the middle of the 1960s, SR 330 continued further north along present-day County Road 330 (CR 330) to SR 12 near Arcadia. At the end of that time frame, the highway was restored to its original, shorter routing whose primary function was to serve the community of Vanlue.\n\nSR 330 is situated entirely within the eastern half of Hancock County. The highway begins at a diamond interchange with the SR 15 expressway in Amanda Township, picking up where CR 197 leaves off. The highway briefly travels to the northeast amidst farmland before entering Vanlue. SR 330 follows Buffalo Street into the village, passing amidst some commercial businesses as it enters into the downtown of the village. SR 330 turns southeast onto Main Street, and goes through a residential neighborhood before reaching the East Street intersection, which is located adjacent to Vanlue High School. The state route turns north onto East Street, and passes amidst a few more residences prior to departing the village and re-entering Amanda Township. The remainder of the highway travels among a landscape of vast farmland, with a few homes appearing here and there. SR 330 travels due north, then follows a slight reverse curve that takes it to the northwest before resuming a northerly trek. Amidst that curve, it enters Biglick Township. SR 330 comes to an end at its junction with SR 568. Continuing north following the end of the state route is CR 330.\n\nThis highway is not included as a component of the National Highway System, a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country.\n\nThe SR 330 designation was assigned in 1932. Originally, the highway, following its present alignment, served as a spur route off of what is now SR 568 serving the village of Vanlue. At the time, SR 568 was designated as a portion of SR 15.\n\nFive years after its assignment, SR 330 was extended north from its present northern terminus along the routing of CR 330 to a new endpoint at SR 12 approximately north of Arcadia. By 1965, SR 330's northern terminus was re-instated to its original location when the entirety of the 1937 extension was deleted from the state highway system. With jurisdiction of this portion of roadway transferred to Hancock County, the road was now identified as CR 330. Meanwhile, this was also the year when the SR 15 designation was transferred to a new four-lane expressway that was constructed in parallel to the south of its original two-lane alignment between Findlay and Carey, passing just to the south of Vanlue. Consequently, the route intersecting SR 330 at its northern terminus was now designated as SR 568. At the same time, SR 330 was extended slightly to the south of its former southern terminus in Vanlue to a new endpoint at a diamond interchange with the new SR 15 expressway.\n"}

He was awarded the prize for composition in his final year for his piece \"Dense\" which went on to win a Prix de Residence at the 1996 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition , leading to a residency at Xenakis' UPIC studio in Paris the following year. The piece was short-listed by the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) and following a performance at the Purcell Room in 1998, it was selected by then SPNM artistic director Howard Skempton for the George Butterworth award.\n\nFrom Bangor, Prior went on to study composition with Jonty Harrison at the University of Birmingham, graduating with a PhD in 2001. During his time in Birmingham, Prior's work was often concerned with integrating acoustic space as a compositional parameter in his work. This theme stimulated interests which still define the work he is involved in today, whether that be through his installations, sound-walks, acousmatic compositions or the sound designs he has made for museums and galleries. Another feature of the work Prior was producing during this period but less evident in more recent projects, was the attempt to assimilate free improvisation into the devising of his ultimately 'fixed' compositions, for example \"Somewhere Submarine\" (1996), for piano and tape (joint winner of the 1997 Cornelius Cardew Composition Competition) and \"Another Poisonous Sunset\" (1998).\n\nPrior was awarded a Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) stipendium in 1999, funding a one-year residency at the Technische Universität Berlin, where he completed the work submitted for his PhD. Following the completion of his residency, he stayed living in Berlin, undertaking a commission from the DAAD Kunstlerprogram which led to his twenty-four channel acousmatic piece \"Love and Death\", premiered at the Parochialkirche, Berlin as part of the Inventionen festival, 2000.\nIn 1997, Prior collaborated with Swiss choreographers Jürg Koch and R. Lucia Baumgartner on the piece \"an die Materie\" and the music from this piece went on to win an honorary mention at the 1998 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition and first prize in the 1998 EAR (Hungarian Radio) composition prize. When Koch went on to join CandoCo dance company, he worked with Prior again, commissioning him to write the score for \"Amaze in You\" in 2002.\n\nPrior first collaborated with architect Frances Crow in 1997 on \"Triptych\", an installation jointly commissioned by SPNM and the Southbank Centre, London. They worked together again on the Arts Council funded \"Good Vibrations\" children's education project in 1999 but it wasn't until 2003 that they formally established Liminal, a design studio with a particular interest in exploring sound and architecture. The partnership has resulted in projects ranging from installations to sound-walks as well as commercial sound design and consultancy and a number of theoretical publications and conference papers. Liminal was formed as a company in order to undertake \"Swash\" (2003), a large-scale, immersive sound installation for Living Coasts in Devon and in keeping with other recent work, this piece has evolved into a number of different iterations. Two years after the completion of the installation version of \"Swash\", Prior made an eight-channel, acousmatic concert version of the piece which was first performed at the Martin Harris Hall in Manchester as part of the Sonic Arts Expo, 2006. In 2007, Prior was commissioned by the SpACE-Net spatial audio research group in York to produce a third, improvised version of the work which has been performed a number of times subsequently. Following the completion of \"Swash\", liminal were made lead sound designers for the Churchill Museum in London designed by celebrated designers Casson Mann. The Churchill Museum has gone on to win a string of awards and was nominated for both the D&AD Award for Outstanding Achievement in Digital Installations and the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize.\n\nSince 2006, liminal have been involved as lead artists in the Warwick Bar development in Birmingham. Their work on this project involved close collaboration with masterplanning architects Kinetic-AIU and has since been cited as an exemplar for artist-architect collaborations by CABE, who part-funded liminal's involvement through their PROJECT fund and features as a case-study in their Artists & Places publication. It was during this project that liminal developed their use of the sound-walk as a research tool, in this instance consolidating the extensive research undertaken into the soundscape of the Warwick Bar site into a binaural walk available to the public. Liminal later contributed to the Cotswold Water Park's twenty-year strategic plan, working with masterplanning consultants Scott Wilson and building on the research techniques they developed for the Warwick Bar project on a series of proposals which address the soundscape of the water park. Liminal's recent work has focussed on the creation of 'listening spaces', whether this takes the form of a site-specific sound-walk, such as \"Black Water Brown Water\" (2008) or architectural interventions such as \"Song Pole\" with poet Larry Lynch (2008), the point of departure for these pieces is to create a reflexive listening experience for the audience; focussing attention back onto the act of listening itself.\n\nIn 2010 they were awarded £50,000 to create \"The Organ of Corti\" to 'recycle' and create new sounds.\n\nPrior began working with New Zealander Dugal McKinnon in 1998 on a composed radio documentary \"Ways of Hearing\" for Resonance FM as part of John Peel's Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre, London. The pair went on to form Arcades in 2000, slowly working towards their album \"Who's Most Lost?\" which was completed in late 2007. Meanwhile, Prior was also asked by UK songwriter John Matthias to produce two tracks on his Ninja Tune release \"Stories From the Water Cooler\". Prior and Matthias went on to form Derailer, whose first project was to remix a track by Corker Conboy called \"Radiant Idiot\". The resulting \"Radiant Idiot Remake\", was chosen by American independent film-maker Harmony Korine for his Thornton's television commercial \"Stuck\". The pair have remixed work by John Richards as well as working towards an album of original material. Prior also remixed John Matthias and Nick Ryan's \"Cortical Songs\", released on the non-classical label. Prior has recorded and/or produced work for artists and ensembles including Icebreaker, Nicola Hitchcock and Michael Bassett as well as contributing sound designs to films by artists Jane Grant and Anya Lewin. In 2007, Prior was invited by improvising vocalist Steve Lewis to join Antti Sakari Saario in providing live electronics for his \"Flocking\" project based around an improvising ensemble. Since 2002, Prior has been working with his brother Andrew Prior on a series of collaborative music projects. Their piece \"Gem Sprinter\" features on the Yacht Club compilation release \"Pallomeri\" under the moniker Orlando Hooks.\n\nSince 2002, Prior has made a series of short films often characterized by their brevity and simplicity. On a number of these films, Prior has collaborated with poet Larry Lynch, who as well as contributing texts often features in the films themselves. Their collaboration \"On What it Might Mean to be Spinning\" features the voice of poet John Hall and was premiered in February 2008 as part of the Voices III festival in Plymouth, UK. Prior's films have been screened across the UK, in Russia, Korea, China, Sweden, Holland and the USA.\n\nPrior's work has won prizes including a number of awards from the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition, Cornelius Cardew Prize, E.A.R (the composition prize of Hungarian National Radio), the George Butterworth prize and a PRS ATOM award. Prior has received awards from the University of Birmingham Alumni award, M.J. West Foundation, the Arts Council of England, the Banff Centre for the Arts, the DAAD and UNESCO.\n\nPrior began teaching in the music department at the University of Birmingham in the late 1990s while a post-graduate student there. Since 2001, Prior has been a lecturer, then senior lecturer in music at Dartington College of Arts, Devon. Prior has given guest lectures and presentations around the world at institutions including the Icelandic Academy of Arts, Reykjavík, Stadia Helsinki Polytechnic and ESMAE School of Music and Performing Arts, Polytechnic Institute of Porto.\n\nPrior lives with Frances Crow in Totnes, Devon.\n"}

{"id": "2191657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191657", "title": "Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary", "text": "Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary\n\nCordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary is a marine sanctuary located off the coast of California. It protects an area of of marine wildlife. The administrative center of the sanctuary is on an offshore granite outcrop by , located on the continental shelf off of California. The outcrop is, at its closest (Point Reyes), from the sanctuary itself.\n\nCordell Bank is one of the United States' 13 National Marine Sanctuaries that protect and preserve ocean ecosystems in the U.S. Cordell Bank is a seamount approximately northwest of San Francisco where the ocean bottom rises to within of the surface. The seamount was discovered in 1853 by the U.S. Coast Survey, and named for Edward Cordell, who surveyed the area more thoroughly in 1869. It was extensively explored and described during 1978-86 by Robert Schmieder, who published a monograph about it [Schmieder, 1991]. It has been protected as a sanctuary since 1989. The protected area encompasses 526 square miles (1347 km) of ocean.\n\nThe unique blend of ocean conditions and undersea topography creates a rich and diverse underwater ecosystem. A subsurface island rises from soft sediments covering the continental shelf. The upper pinnacles reach to within of the surface, and the average depth is . The sanctuary serves as a breeding ground for migratory marine mammals, birds, and fish. The prevailing California Current flows southward along the coast, causing an upwelling of nutrient-rich water that provided the foundation for the area's marine ecosystem.\n\nSanctuary regulations prohibit extraction of hydrocarbons (oil, natural gas), the removal of benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms, discharge of wastes, and removal of cultural resources. Recreational SCUBA diving is not recommended in the sanctuary due to depth and currents.\n\nCordell Bank was originally created 93 million years ago, as a member of the Sierra Nevada. The grinding of the plates at the San Andreas Fault, with the Pacific Plate moving north and the North American Plate moving south, parts of the Sierra Mountains were sheared off and carried northwards, including Cordell Bank. Eventually this grinding carried Cordell Bank to its present location opposite Reyes Point. Cordell Bank is still moving, by an average of per year.\n\nBetween 20,000 and 15,000 years ago the sea level in the area was below the current level, leaving most of Cordell Bank exposed and making it a true island. Today the bank rises out of soft sediment, deposited on the bank more recently by coastal erosion. Within just of Cordell Bank, the continental shelf drops to over deep. The seamount is largely composed of granite.\n\nCoastal California has a rich history of marine utilization by Native Americans and early settlers. Cordell Bank was a mystery prior to the 19th century because neither the Miwok natives nor the settlers had any incentive to venture far out from shore, when food resources were available close to shore. Many European mariners sailed right over Cordell Bank without even knowing it was there.\n\nIn the later half of the 1800s there was a strong incentive to survey the coast of California so as to promote maritime safety. Cordell Bank was discovered in 1853 by George Davidson of the US Coast Survey during a mapping expedition on California's north coast.\n\nIn 1869 Edward Cordell (the reserve's namesake) was sent to collect additional information on a \"shoal west of Point Reyes\". He found the area by following the numerous birds and marine mammals. To measure the depth, Cordell lowered a lead weight into the water until it hit the bottom and then measured the length of the line on its return to the surface. The area was considered a productive fishing area, but not much was discovered about its marine life until an expedition in 1977.\n\nNOAA carried out a detailed multibeam echosounder survey of the area in 1985 from aboard the R/V \"Davidson\".\n\nThe expedition was led by a non-profit research group, Cordell Expeditions. Over the next 10 years, scores of underwater dives documented the organisms living in, on, and around the bank. The efforts gave rise to an understanding of the biodiversity of the bank, and were instrumental in the decision to make it a sanctuary.\n\nA bill (H.R. 5352) was proposed to Congress by Representative Lynn Woolsey to expand the size of the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary and the neighboring Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary by .\n\nIn 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed an expansion of the borders of the sanctuary, along with expansion of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, to include an additional 2,700 square miles, reaching to Point Arena.\n\nExpansion was passed March 2015.\n\n26 species of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions, are known to frequent the waters of the sanctuary. In addition, Cordell Bank is one of the most important feeding grounds in the world for the endangered blue and humpback whales; these species travel all the way from their breeding grounds in coastal Mexico and Central America to feed on the krill that aggregate near the bank. Another unique species is the Pacific white-sided dolphin (\"Lagenorhynchus obliquidens\"), which can be seen in large numbers. Other visitors include California sea lions (\"Zalophus californianus\"), northern elephant seals (\"Mirounga angustirostris\"), northern fur seals (\"Callorhinus ursinus\"), and Steller sea lions (\"Eumetopias jubatus\"), all of which are attracted to the abundance in krill, squid, and juvenile fish. Leatherback sea turtles also inhabit sanctuary waters.\n\nCordell Bank is also a major foraging ground for passing seabirds. Known as the \"Albatross capital of the world,\" 5 of the 14 major species of albatross have been documented there. The two most common are the black-footed albatross (\"Phoebastria nigripes\") and sooty shearwater (\"Puffinus griseus\"). It is also one of the few places to see a short-tailed albatross (\"Phoebastria albatrus\"), which is extremely rare; the species was thought to have gone extinct after World War II. Currently the world population hovers at around 1000 individuals.\n\nCordell Bank is also known for its abundance of fish. Flatfish, most notably sanddabs, make their home on the mud of the seafloor in the sanctuary. Both solitary and schooling fish find refuge for predators among the bank's rocky pinnacles. Cordell Bank supports more than 246 species of fish, including 44 species of rockfish, ranging in size from the 8-inch pygmy rockfish to the yelloweye rockfish.\n\nAlthough far from shore, sport fishers prize Cordell Bank as a fishing spot, and regularly venture out from shore to catch albacore and salmon.\n\nThis unusual granite mountain is surrounded on three sides by deep waters, which allows the flow of deep nutrient-rich waters over relatively shallow waters with sufficient light to support photosynthesis.\n\nThe ecological cycle at Cordell Bank can be divided into three oceanographic seasons. During the spring, strong northwestern winds push the water southward along the California coast. Gale winds and the Earth's rotation drive surface water away from the shore, only to be replaced by an upwelling of more nutrient-rich waters from offshore. this contributes to the growth in numbers of phytoplankton, which are the foundation of the marine food web, in turn leading to a rise in the food supply, and thus numbers, of the organisms higher up the chain.\n\nDuring the late summer and fall seasons, the coastal winds that stirred up the deeper waters die down, and the northward-flowing Davidson Current prevails, bringing warm but nutrient-poor water from the south.\n\nDuring the winter storm months, the sea is dominated by rough weather, which mixes the deeper water with that above. The temperature on top of the continental shelf mixes, and the temperature, salinity, and the concentration of nutrients in them are assimilated.\n\nWorks cited\n\n"}

Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 24 approximately northeast of downtown Defiance, and its eastern terminus is at US 6 nearly north of Bradner. The majority of the route is known as the Defiance Pike.\n\nThe state route begins at a diamond interchange with the US 24 freeway (exit 28). The interchange is partially within the city limits of Defiance and partially in Richland Township. Defiance County Route 175 heads north from the interchange while SR 281 heads south along Domersville Road often crossing between Defiance and Richland Township. After a traffic signal at a connector road to Defiance County Route 424, the route crosses the Maumee River on a plate girder bridge. A short distance later, SR 281 intersects SR 18 and the two routes form a concurrency and head east out of the city past a General Motors factory. After , the SR 18 concurrency ends and SR 281 continues due east. Outside of the Defiance area, the route's surroundings becomes much more agricultural. After exiting Defiance County, it enters Henry County. SR 281 does not pass through any incorporated villages through Henry County, but it intersects State Routes 108, 109, and 65. After crossing into Wood County, SR 281 enters the small village of Custar. SR 281 continues east intersecting SR 235 and SR 25 but also passes over Interstate 75 without an interchange. After its intersection with SR 199, SR 281 turns to the northeast and enters the village of Wayne. Through Wayne, the route has the road names of Main Street and Church Street. northeast of Wayne, SR 281 then passes through the village of Bradner first on Church Street, then due north on Main Street. SR 281 ends at as stop-controlled intersection with US 6 about north of Bradner. The road continues north as the Freedom Township-maintained Bradner Road.\n\nSR 281 was first designated on its current alignment in 1930, but only on the segment between SR 109 and SR 65 in Henry County. In 1934, the route was extended east into Wood County to end at then-US 25 and US 68 in Wood County (modern-day SR 25) and within one year, was extended west to SR 18 near Defiance. The route was extended further east to its current eastern terminus in 1939 when SR 281 was routed over county roads and SR 297 from Wayne through Bradner to US 6. The route would remain unchanged for 33 years except for becoming fully asphalt-paved by 1950.\n\nIn 1972, SR 281 was extended west on a new bridge over the Maumee River and over existing roads to end at the US 24 bypass of Defiance and Napoleon. The road between CR 424 (formerly SR 424) and US 24 had been designated as a part of US 24 during the time the Defiance bypass was complete but the Napoleon portion was still under construction. The at-grade intersection with US 24 was replaced by a diamond interchange in 2007 as a part of the widening of US 24 through northwestern Ohio.\n"}

{"id": "2191711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191711", "title": "Mississippi River Delta", "text": "Mississippi River Delta\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta is the river delta at the confluence of the Mississippi River with the Gulf of Mexico, in Louisiana in the southeastern United States. It is a area of land that stretches from Vermilion Bay on the west, to the Chandeleur Islands in the east, on Louisiana's southeastern coast. It is part of the American Mediterranean Sea and the Louisiana coastal plain, one of the largest areas of coastal wetlands in the United States. The Mississippi River Delta is the 7th largest river delta on Earth (USGS) and is an important coastal region for the United States, containing more than of coastal wetlands and 37% of the estuarine marsh in the conterminous U.S. The coastal area is the nation's largest drainage basin and drains about 41% of the contiguous United States into the Gulf of Mexico at an average rate of .\n\nThe modern Mississippi River Delta formed over the last approximately 4,500 years as the Mississippi River deposited sand, clay and silt along its banks and in adjacent basins. The Mississippi River Delta is a river-dominated delta system, influenced by the largest river system in North America. The shape of the current birdfoot delta reflects the dominance the river exerts over the other hydrologic and geologic processes at play in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Prior to the extensive leveeing of the Mississippi River that began in the 1930s, the river avulsed its course in search of a shorter route to the Gulf of Mexico approximately every 1,000–1,500 years. The prehistoric and historic delta lobes of the Mississippi River Delta have influenced the formation of the Louisiana coastline and led to the creation of over of coastal wetlands.\n\nAs the river changed course, the natural flow of freshwater and sediment changed as well, resulting in periods of land building and land loss in different areas of the delta. This process by which the river changes course is known as avulsion, or delta-switching, and forms the variety of landscapes that make up the Mississippi River Delta.\n\nThe Atchafalaya River is the largest distributary of the Mississippi River and is also considered to be an influential part of the continual land-building processes within the Mississippi River Delta. The river's tributary channel was formed approximately 500 years ago and the Atchafalaya and Wax Lake deltas emerged around the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nStarting with the earliest European settlement, people have struggled with the delta's natural cycle of floods, progradation, and transgression. Increased economic development and human habitation in the region created a desire to protect society from the threats posed by this mighty waterway. Beginning in the 20th century, advances in technology and engineering allowed humans to alter the river in fundamental ways. Although these changes successfully shielded many people from danger and enabled significant economic development in the region, they have proven to have profoundly negative effects on the downstream delta.\n\nThe formation of the Mississippi River Delta can be traced back to the late Cretaceous Period, approximately 100 million years ago, with the creation of the Mississippi embayment. The embayment began focusing sediment into the Gulf of Mexico, which facilitated the deltaic land-building processes for the future. During the Paleogene Period (approx. 65.5 to 23 million years ago), a series of smaller scale, regional rivers entered present-day southern Louisiana allowing an increase in dispersion of sediment deposition into the delta region. The Mississippi embayment then became a primary focus of sediment deposition during the Miocene Epoch (approx. 23 to 5.3 million years ago), which built the foundation of the modern delta region. The modern day Mississippi River Delta plain began to evolve during the Holocene Epoch (around 7,500 to 8,000 years ago) due to the deceleration of sea level rise and the natural shifting of the river's course every 1,000–1,500 years.\n\nThe delta cycle refers to a dynamic process whereby the river deposits sediment at its outfall, growing a delta lobe, then eventually, seeking a shorter path to the sea, abandons its previous course and associated delta. After the river changes course and abandons the delta headland, the region experiences land loss due to the processes of subsidence, erosion of the marsh shoreline, and the natural redistribution of sands deposited along the delta that create the barrier islands. The delta cycle contains the natural process of land loss and land gain, due to the directionality and discharge of the river. This process formed the bays, bayous, coastal wetlands, and barrier islands that make up the coastline of Louisiana.\n\nThe Mississippi River major deltaic cycle began over 7,000 years ago, eventually forming six delta complexes which are major depositional elements of a delta plain. The Mississippi River Delta complexes consist of smaller areas known as delta lobes, which contain the basins and other natural landscapes of the coastline.\n\nThe six Mississippi River Delta complexes are as follows:\n\nThe history and culture that is linked to the Mississippi River Delta is as unique as its geologic landscape. The mouth of the Mississippi River was found in 1519 by Alvarez de Pineda of Spain. Robert Cavelier de La Salle claimed the territory around the mouth of the Mississippi River for France in 1682, and the region grew with importance with its strategic location for trade and security.\n\nIn 1699 the French built their first crude fort at La Balize, on the Southeast Pass in Pass á Loutre, to control passage on the Mississippi. By 1721, they had built the wooden lighthouse-type structure (la balise means seamark in French) that gave the settlement its name. Built in the marshes, the village was vulnerable to hurricane damage. In addition, ships had to deal with the shifting conditions of tides, currents and mudflats through the mouth of the river. From 1700 to 1888, the main shipping channel was changed four times in response to shifting sandbars, mudflats and hurricanes.\n\nIn 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. During this period, the economic and political significance of New Orleans and the mouth of the Mississippi River increased, and it became an integral part of the nation's farming industries. Due to the influx of nutrient-rich soil from the Mississippi River, the delta is a prime area for farming sugar cane, cotton and indigo, crops that were introduced into Louisiana farmlands during the pre-Civil War era. Many of these processes are important resources that the delta still provides today.\n\nThe importance of navigation and trade on the Mississippi only increased after the Civil War, and like the river itself, this economic development eventually flowed into the delta. In the 1870s, former delta swamplands were being transformed, via levee construction, into fertile farmland. Timber companies began harvesting lucrative forests and planters followed, taking advantage of the new agricultural opportunities. More railroads entered the area, replacing steamboats as the primary means of transporting the delta's rich natural bounty.\n\nWith the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, the Mississippi River Delta became an even more important transportation artery. In addition to shipping, local and commercial fisheries continued to expand. The discovery of vast oil and gas deposits brought further economic and environmental changes to the delta. Despite these profound changes, the delta today remains very much rooted in the vibrant cultural and social traditions of its residents.\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta is home to more than two million people. The location of the delta at the mouth of the Mississippi River allowed for the area to be a cultural gateway into the United States, and influenced the mix of nationalities which settled in the area over time, forming the diversity of the region.\n\nLouisiana's first 18th century colonists were French, but they were soon joined by Spanish and Acadian settlers. The region has been home to other European-immigrant ethnic groups, beginning in the 19th century, including German, Sicilian, and Irish. There are also the Africans, West Indians, and Native Americans in the mix. The combination of these groups over time has created the special culture found in the Mississippi River Delta.\n\nTwo unique groups are the Creoles and the Cajuns. In general terms, Creole refers to a black, white, or mixed-race native of Louisiana. Creoles descended from the union of various ethnic groups in Louisiana, and they are often categorized according to their heritage. Creole populations before 1803 were typically born of French and/or Spanish parents; as such, they kept their European characteristics and cultures. A sub-group is known as the \"Creoles of color,\" born of the mingling of African, European, and Native American identities. During the colonial period, the mixed-race Creoles were usually free from bondage, obtained an education, and often owned businesses and property.\n\nThe Cajuns are another ethnic group in southern Louisiana; they primarily consider themselves to be descendants of the Acadian settlers who were expelled from Nova Scotia by the British after the French and Indian War, when France lost its North American colonies. The Cajuns have intermarried with all ethnicities, profoundly influencing the culture of Louisiana. The Creole and Cajun cultures possessed distinct identities and remain strong influences in the Mississippi River Delta. They continue to shape preferences of food, music, and art, as well as to maintain the unique identities existing in the southernmost parts of the region. Both cultures speak a form of French; but they are considered to be autonomous and distinct dialects.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1920, New Orleans became the birthplace of jazz and since has continued its legacy of being home to budding musicians and new musical experiences, tying music directly to its unique culture and diverse heritage. The origins of jazz and blues music in the region is closely connected to the Mississippi River and the delta, as the location allowed for an influx of cultural influences, including blues and bluegrass music from upriver, to the African and Latin folk hymns and music from the Caribbean islands. The delta is still synonymous with the sounds of jazz, funk and zydeco and remains to be an important cultural hub for new sounds and music, bringing thousands to the area every year to experience the lifestyle and participate in the natural rhythms of the area.\n\nThe region is also home to a unique and renowned culinary tradition. Cajun food is defined by its use of ingredients widely available from the delta. Spices, shellfish, and grains, all provided by the delta's naturally rich environment, define many of these aromatic and flavorful dishes. Cajun culinary techniques and recipes continue to draw thousands of tourists to the region each year and have been exported around the world.\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta provides an array of natural habitats and resources that benefit not only the state of Louisiana and coastal region, but also the entire nation. The coastal wetlands have a number of diverse landscapes that connect a variety of habitats to both the land and water.\n\nLouisiana's wetlands are one of the nation's most productive and important natural assets. Consisting of natural levees, barrier islands, forests, swamps, and fresh, brackish and saline marshes, the region is home to complex ecosystems and habitats that are necessary for sustaining its unique and vibrant nature. In addition to the environmental factors, the Mississippi River Delta also provides numerous economic resources and benefits that are unique to the region. These vital resources are at constant risk of being lost with the continual land loss and the decreasing size of the natural coastal area.\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta has a strong economy which relies heavily on tourism and recreational activities such as fishing, hunting and wildlife watching as well as commercial fishing, oil, gas, and shipping industries. There are a number of major industries in the Mississippi River Delta that drive the local and national economy, including:\n\n\nIn total, the five Gulf Coast states generate around $34billion annually in tourism. The recreational wildlife tourism industry is an important component of the tourism sector for the Mississippi River Delta and the Gulf Coast. The report, \"Wildlife Tourism and the Gulf Coast Economy,\" shows how wildlife tourism is a vital industry, bringing in more than $19billion in annual spending by tourists and generating more than $5billion in federal, state and local tax revenue.\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta has an extremely diverse ecological landscape, consisting of a number of wildlife habitats and vegetation. The coastal landscape of the Mississippi River Delta is rich in resources and contains some of the most unusual areas in the United States. In addition to providing habitats for wildlife living in the region, the Mississippi River Delta's wetlands, marshes and barrier islands also provide the vital protection for coastal residents and communities from storm surge and flooding.\n\n\n\nA variety of mammals rely on the habitats that the delta provides, from forests to swamps to estuaries. These areas are home to Louisiana black bears, bottlenose dolphins, minks, beavers, armadillos, foxes, coyotes and bobcats. The region also supports a number of invasive mammals, such as nutria and feral hogs, which destroy native ecosystems – including coastal wetlands – and cause trouble for native species.\n\nThe delta is a vital stopping point along the Mississippi Flyway. The flyway stretches from southern Ontario to the mouth of the Mississippi River, and contains one of the longest migration routes in the Western Hemisphere. About 460 bird species have been recorded in Louisiana, with 90% (300 species) found within the coastal wetlands. Many diverse and rare species including indigo buntings, scarlet tanagers, yellow-crowned night herons and bald eagles call Louisiana home. Also found in the Mississippi River Delta are great egrets, glossy ibises, roseate spoonbills, wintering hummingbirds, birds of prey and wood storks.\n\n\nThroughout its geological history, the Mississippi River Delta experienced natural processes of growth and retraction as a result of sediment deposition from the river. However, in recent history, the processes of land loss have far surpassed the river's land-building properties due to a number of factors. Some of the causes of delta land loss stem from natural causes, like hurricanes and other effects of climate change. However, the Mississippi River Delta also suffers from a lack of sedimentation due to the levee systems, navigation canals and other man-made structures within the region. These structures have proven to be detrimental to the natural land-building power of the river as many of the structures slow or eliminate the river's flow into certain areas, increasing salt-water intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico into freshwater wetlands. The salt water weakens these freshwater ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to destruction by hurricanes and unable to withstand heavy storm surge.\n\nSubsidence: In the absence of riverine sediment inputs to counteract it, net subsidence in the Mississippi River Delta occurs at a much faster rate than in other areas of the United States. Researchers suggest that subsidence may be further exacerbated through fluid extraction by the gas and oil industry.\n\nHurricanes and storms: Coastal wetlands and barrier islands are the first line of protection for Louisiana communities and cities from hurricanes and storm surge. However, as these landscapes are weakened, they become more vulnerable to strong winds and flooding. For example, following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, approximately of wetlands became open water, demonstrating permanent wetland loss.\n\nSea level rise: A combination of subsidence, hurricanes and storms and sea level rise leads to increases in marsh and wetlands loss. Climate change also has effects on the strength of the coastline. As global sea levels rise, the areas within the Mississippi River Delta that experience subsidence may permanently flood and become open water. Additionally, the lack of sediment into these flooded areas also exacerbates the rate at which sea level rise affects the region.\n\nThe Mississippi River took thousands of years to build its delta, but land loss is occurring at a much faster pace. A number of steps have been taken over the past decade to increase the resiliency of coastal Louisiana. Research has been conducted in order to find the most feasible and effective restoration projects to mitigate further land loss and to implement rebuilding processes for the delta. Studies have conservatively estimated that without sediment input, of the Mississippi Delta may be submerged by 2100, indicating a need for directed restoration efforts. Projects to counteract this include:\n\nThese projects are authorized through the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA 2007), which authorizes flood control, navigation, and environmental projects and studies by the Army Corps of Engineers. Some of the important LCA Projects include:\n\nThe state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) brought together national and international scientists and engineers to create a $50-billion, 50-year plan to save Louisiana's coast. The plan was unanimously approved by the legislature in May 2012 and outlines 109 projects that intends to bring long-term benefits, resiliency and sustainability to the communities and ecosystems along the coast. Within the plan there are projects that vary in size and impact, including, hydrologic restoration, sediment diversions, barrier island restoration and marsh creation projects. Some of the projects are already underway, but many of them still need further approval and funding authorization.\n\nThe Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act (RESTORE Act) was passed by Congress as part of the Transportation Reauthorization Act on June 29, 2012 and was signed into law by the President Barack Obama on July 7, 2012. This law followed the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 and ensures that 80 percent of the civil Clean Water Act fines paid by BP and the other responsible parties are directed to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council and five Gulf Coast states to use for environmental and economic restoration.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on July 16, 2004, and stars Danielle Panabaker as Brittany Aarons and Brenda Song as Natasha Kwon-Schwartz. Brittany, a regular middle school student in the suburbs, accidentally exchanges cell phones with pop singer Jordan Cahill. This was one of the first made-for-television movies by Disney which was also accompanied by its own soundtrack. The film gathered 3.7 million viewers which made the film the most-watched telecast in its time period in the kids 6–11 and 9–14 demographics. The film's soundtrack entered the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 and peaked at #5 on the \"Billboard\" Top Kid Audio charts.\n\nBrittany Aarons (Danielle Panabaker) is a regular teenage girl, one of the many who has a crush on popular pop singer Jordan Cahill (Taran Killam). However, she is bored of living a suburban existence and pines for excitement. At school, she meets a new girl, Natasha Kwon-Schwartz (Brenda Song), who informs Brittany that she moved to suburbia from several years on and off living in Europe and New York. Brittany's other friends dislike Natasha for her nonconformism, but Brittany pursues a friendship with her. Upon finding out that Jordan is filming a video nearby, Brittany invites Natasha to join her and her fangirl friends to watch the shoot. Jordan, at the video shoot, expresses dislike for the shallow new single, wanting to sing his own lyrics, which his record company denies him. When Jordan and his team knock into Brittany and Natasha after the shoot, Eddie (Jordan's assistant, best friend and confidante) and Brittany accidentally pick up one another's phones in the ensuing mess.\n\nBrittany tries to return \"Eddie's\" phone but is denied entry at Jordan's hotel. Once they get a hold of Eddie and figure out the phone is Jordan's, they demand to speak with the pop star before they would return it, which Eddie refuses. Natasha convinces Brittany that it would be fun to mess with Jordan, and change his image. They prank call his hair stylist, get her to cut off all his hair, and get a new wardrobe for him. Along the way they find that Jordan's life is not the life he chooses, but rather the one his record company wants for him. At first he is terrified that his personal barber gave him a major haircut, but eventually accepts it as the first step towards a break from his manufactured image, enjoying his new wardrobe and look, which he thinks Eddie procured. Eventually, the girls demand Eddie have Jordan perform at a rally hosted by Brittany's mother to save a local landmark, which was previously failing to draw attention.\n\nJordan gets a hold of Brittany after Eddie confesses to the whole situation, and Jordan explains everything to her. She and Natasha make up from a falling out, and go to meet up with him while being chased by the record company who are tracking his phone. They send his lyrics for one of his songs \"More Than Me\" to everyone through Brittany's phone, ditch his phone and get a ride to the rally with Brittany's sister. At the rally, Eddie tries to stop Jordan from appearing but ultimately supports him, and the landmark is preserved. Brittany, Natasha, and Brittany's fangirl friends become dancers in the music video he was making at the beginning of the movie, which now features Eddie replacing Jordan. It is shown that Brittany and Jordan keep in touch, and although he invites her to go to New York with him (over the phone), she declines, saying things are really exciting in her suburban town.\n\n\nThe film was mostly shot on several locations throughout the Greater New Orleans Area, in particular St. Tammany Parish. The school scenes were filmed in the atrium, front steps, and the courtyard of Ben Franklin High School in the Lakefront area. Lockers were temporarily moved into the atrium to give the appearance of a hallway, and door frames were painted with temporary red paint.\n\nThe music video for \"Make a Wish\" was filmed in City Park in New Orleans. The other video is filmed at the Piaza d'Italia in Downtown New Orleans.\n\nThe \"Old House\" from the film is actually the Otis House from Fairview-Riverside State Park in Madisonville on the Northshore. The house was aged for production, but restored to its actual appearance at the end of the film. The Otis House was originally built in the 1880s, has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1998, and it actually is located near the expanding suburb of Mandeville. When Brittany is riding through the suburbs on her bike she is actually riding through Lafreniere Park.\n\nThe film received 3.7 million viewers at its TV premiere, including top rankings in the time period in the kids 6–11 and 9–14 demographics.\n\nWalt Disney Records released a soundtrack for the album to promote the television movie with the original movie promotional poster. The songs below are included in the first edition of the soundtrack:\nTaran Killam who played Jordan Cahill confirmed on social media that he did not sing in the film. Singer and actor Drew Seeley (who had a brief role in the film) sang in place of Killam. Seeley also sang for Zac Efron 2 years later for High School Musical\n\n\nThe enhanced golden collectors edition included the following songs with the same promotional movie poster:\n\n\n\"Good Life\" and \"Over It\" was featured in several DisneyMania and Walt Disney Records albums and complaition soundtracks. \"More Than Me\" by Jordan Cahill / Taran Killam was featured in \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" and Haylie Duff's \"A Whatever Life\" was in 7th Heaven.\n\n"}

It may also cleave polysaccharide chains between residues that are not the terminal residue, although releasing oligosaccharides from conjugated protein and lipid molecules is more common.\n\nIt breaks the glycosidic bonds between two sugar monomer in the polymer. It is different from exoglycosidase that it does not do so at the terminal residue. Hence, it is used to release long carbohydrates from conjugated molecules. If an exoglycosidase were used, every monomer in the polymer would have to be removed, one by one from the chain, taking a long time. An endoglycosidase cleaves, giving a polymeric product.\n\nPROTEIN-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-...-x\n\nThe mechanism is an enzymatic hydrolysis that requires two critical molecules; a proton donor (most likely an acid) and a nucleophile(most likely a base). The Endoglycosidases mechanism has two forms; an acid catalyzed protonation of the glycosidic oxygen yielding stereochemical retention at the anomeric carbon or an acid catalyzed protonation of the glycosidic oxygen with a concomitant attack of a water molecule activated by the base residue yielding a stereochemical inversion.\n\nBoth mechanisms exhibit the same distance between the proton donor and the glycosidic oxygen, situating the proton donor close enough to the glycosidic oxygen for hydrogen bonding. It is the distance between the nucleophile and the anomeric carbon where the two mechanisms begin to diverge. Because the inversion mechanism must accommodate enough space for the water molecule, the nucleophile is situated further away from the anomeric carbon. In the retention mechanism, this distance is only 5.5 -7 angstroms but increases to 9-10 angstroms in the inversion mechanism. Furthermore, the inversion mechanism was found to proceed through a single displacement mechanism involving an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state. Due to the retention mechanism's proximity between the two carboxyl groups, it goes through a double displacement mechanism that produces a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.\n\nAn exoglycosidase would remove each carbohydrate monomer (x) one by one from the end, starting at x, whereas and endoglycosidase can cut at any glycosidic bond (-) and may cleave after a signature 'link oligosaccharide' that links certain carbohydrates to certain proteins.\n\nThere has been great potential shown in the use of endoglycosidase enzymes undergoing mutagenesis. This new mutated enzyme when exposed to the proper compounds will undergo oligosaccharide synthesis and will not hydrolyze the newly formed polymer chains. This is an extremely useful tool, as oligosaccharides have a great potential for use as therapeutics. For example, globo H hexasaccharide will indicate cancer related malignant cell transformation in the breast, prostate and ovaries.\n\nEndoglycosidases also have potential application in fighting autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In 2008, a team of researchers demonstrated that injection of endgoglycosidase S “efficiently removes the IgG-associated sugar domain in vivo and interferes with autoantibody-mediated proinflammatory processes in a variety of autoimmune models.” Clearly the manipulation and mutation of this enzyme holds great promise for being able to fight a variety of diseases in the body.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2191746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191746", "title": "Royal Ann cherry", "text": "Royal Ann cherry\n\nThe Royal Ann or Royal Anne (also called \"Napoleon\", \"Napoleon Bigarreau\" and \"Queen Anne\") is a variety of cherry, similar in appearance and taste to the 'Rainier cherry'.\n\nKingdom: Plantae\n\nDivision: Magnoliophyta\n\nClass: Magnoliopsida\n\nFamily: Rosaseae\n\nGenus: \"Prunus\"\n\nScientific Name: \"Prunus avium\"\n\nRoyal Ann cherry trees are perennial semi-dwarfs that bloom early April with harvest in mid-summer. They are deciduous trees that can be characterized by dark green leaves and clusters of small fragrant white flowers that are about 2.5-3 centimeters wide. Royal Ann flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive organs, however, the tree cannot self-pollinate. Another pollinator species is necessary in order for fertilization to occur, most commonly bees. Each flower goes on to produce a single Royal Ann cherry. A mature fruit producing Royal Ann tree is about 12–15 feet in height. The trees prefer a half to full day of sun, and soil with good drainage. Royal Ann trees require a temperate climate, where the average winter temperature does not drop below 10 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRoyal Ann cherries are fleshy stone fruits similar in size to most cherry varieties, and are yellow to light pink colored. Royal Ann fruits are often mistaken for Rainier cherries because of their similar appearance and taste. Trees produce fruit within 1–3 years after planting and are considered fully mature around 8 years old. Royal Ann trees can produce up to 50 pounds of cherries per season.\n\nCherries are famous for containing high levels of antioxidants, which are substances that inhibit oxidation in living organisms. Sweet cherries, like the Royal Ann are also high in sugars, like glucose, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol. Organic acids in sweet cherries include malic, citric, shikimic, and fumaric.\n\nStone fruits are known to contain toxic compounds that produce hydrogen cyanide, which is toxic or lethal in large doses. These compounds can be found in the bark, flowers, seeds, and leaves of cherry trees. Children have been poisoned in the past by eating or swallowing large amounts of seeds. Livestock have been killed by grazing on branches and leaves.\n\nIt is thought that cherries first originated in Turkey, near the Black Sea. Cultivation has been credited to the Greeks who helped the fruit spread through the Roman Empire and to England, where cherry trees were used as a food source and also for timber.\n\nSweet cherry trees were initially brought to the United States with the colonists in 1629. In 1847, Henderson Lewelling brought 700 fruit trees of \"Napoleon Bigarreau\" from Iowa to Oregon’s Willamette Valley to start a cherry orchard. Seth Lewelling joined his brother Henderson in 1850, he renamed the tree 'Royal Ann'. Seth later developed the Bing cherry.\n\nSweet cherry trees are labeled as being very delicate and finicky. They are not a popular choice for growing with hobby gardeners because they can be very time consuming. Tips for facilitating growth and harvesting include bending the branches.\n\nSweet cherry trees grow vertically very quickly, as more nutrients from sunlight means a higher yield of fruits. However, the more vertical the tree is, the more foliage there is on the tree rather than fruit. By bending the branches at an angle of 30-60 degrees in relation to the trunk and anchoring them to the ground, the tree will produce more fruit and fewer leaves. Research findings show that bending branches slows the release of hormones coursing through the tree that are essential for fruit growth.\n\nBirds are the most common pest of cherry trees, seeking the sweet fruits. Birds can be repelled by using netting to cover trees in an orchard or deploying flash tape to scare them away.\n\nBacterial canker is a disease that can afflict all cherry trees, including Royal Ann trees. Signs of the disease include dead branches and brown colored damaged spots on branches or the trunk. Bacterial canker can be deterred by applying a copper spray to the trees in the fall and winter months.\n\nAnother common problem is rain splitting. This happens when the cherries are near ripe, and full of nutrients. With an excess of water intake, the skin of the fruit can no longer hold all of the nutrients and fluids and bursts open.\n\nBecause of their firm and fleshy traits, Royal Ann cherries are ideal for home commercial and home canning. They’re often used for making pies, sauces, and jams because of their natural sweetness. Because Royal Ann cherries are so fragile, they make a great option for canning because the fruit is not being selected based on appearances as if it were freshly picked. Bruised Royal Ann cherries will taste the same mashed into a pie or in canned preserves.\n\nRoyal Ann cherries are also the ideal variety used to make maraschino cherries for cocktails and dishes. Royal Ann cherries are also excellent and sweet eaten fresh on their own.\n"}

{"id": "2191771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191771", "title": "CPU core voltage", "text": "CPU core voltage\n\nThe CPU core voltage (V) is the power supply voltage supplied to the CPU (which is a digital circuit), GPU, or other device containing a processing core. The amount of power a CPU uses, and thus the amount of heat it dissipates, is the product of this voltage and the current it draws.\nIn modern CPUs, which are CMOS circuits, the current is almost proportional to the clock speed, the CPU drawing almost no current between clock cycles. (See, however, subthreshold leakage.)\n\nTo conserve power and manage heat, many laptop and desktop processors have a power management feature that software (usually the operating system) can use to adjust the clock speed and core voltage dynamically.\n\nOften a voltage regulator module converts from 5V or 12 V or some other voltage to whatever CPU core voltage is required by the CPU.\n\nThe trend is towards lower core voltages, which conserve power. This presents the CMOS designer with a challenge, because in CMOS the voltages go only to ground and the supply voltage, the source, gate, and drain terminals of the FETs have only the supply voltage or zero voltage across them.\n\nThe MOSFET formula: formula_1 says that the current formula_2 supplied by the FET is proportional to the gate-source voltage reduced by a threshold voltage formula_3, which depends on the geometrical shape of the FET's channel and gate and their physical properties, especially capacitance. To reduce formula_3 (necessary to reduce supply voltage and increase current) one must increase capacitance. However, the load being driven is another FET gate, so the current it requires is proportional to capacitance, which thus requires the designer to keep capacitance low. \n\nThe trend towards lower supply voltage therefore works against the goal of high clock speed.\nOnly improvements in photolithography and reduction in threshold voltage allow both to improve at once. On another note, the formula shown above is for long channel MOSFETs. With the area of the MOSFETs halving every 18-24 months (Moore's law) the distance between the two terminals of the MOSFET switch called the channel length is becoming smaller and smaller. This changes the nature of the relationship between terminal voltages and current. \n\nOverclocking a processor increases its clock speed at the cost of system stability. Withstanding higher clock speeds often requires higher core voltage at the cost of power consumption and heat dissipation. This is called \"overvolting\". Overvolting generally involves running a processor out of its specifications, which may damage it or shorten CPU life.\n\nA \"dual-voltage\" CPU uses a \"split-rail design\" so the processor core can use a lower voltage, while the external Input/Output (I/O) voltages remain at 3.3 volts for backwards compatibility.\n\nA \"single-voltage CPU\" uses a single power voltage throughout the chip, supplying both I/O power and internal power.\nAs of 2002 Microprocessor#Market statistics, most CPUs are single-voltage CPUs.\nAll CPUs before the Pentium MMX are single-voltage CPUs.\n\nDual-voltage CPUs were introduced for performance gain when increasing clock speeds and finer semiconductor fabrication processes caused excess heat generation and power supply concerns, especially regarding laptop computers. Using a voltage regulator, the external I/O voltage levels was transformed to lower voltages to reduce power draw, resulting in less heat for the ability to operate at higher frequencies.\n\n\"VRT\" is a feature on older Intel P5 Pentium processors that are typically intended for use in a mobile environment. It refers to splitting the core voltage supply from the I/O voltage. A VRT processor has a 3.3 V I/O and 2.9 V core voltage, to save power compared to a typical Pentium processor with both I/O and core voltage at 3.3V. All Pentium MMX and later processors adopted this so-called split rail power supply.\n\n\n"}

The band released six albums before splitting up in 1996. They reformed in 2001.\n\nAlice Donut formed in 1986 after the demise of the Sea Beasts, a band at Columbia University, the name soon trimmed from the initial Alice Donut Liver Henry Moore, a play on \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\". Ted Houghton, Tomas Antona, Dave Giffen and Tom Meltzer recruited drummer Stephen Moses and quickly found a substantial audience at CBGB. Guitarist Michael Jung soon replaced Meltzer. The band's first commercial release was the \"Donut Comes Alive\" album, released in 1988 on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label, followed in 1989 with \"Bucketfulls of Sickness and Horror in an Otherwise Meaningless Life\".\n\nIn August 1990 the band's debut single, a cover version of \"My Boyfriend's Back\", preceded third album \"Mule\", released the following month, and described by \"Trouser Press\" as \"challenging and invigorating\". \"Revenge Fantasies of the Impotent\" was released in May 1991 (and later included in Andrew Earles' \"Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981-1996\"), and included an instrumental cover of Black Sabbath's \"War Pigs\". Austrian born Bassist Sissi Schulmeister joined the band before the end of the year, with Richard Marshall also joining on guitar.\n\nThe band's fifth album, \"The Untidy Suicides of Your Degenerate Children\", was released in September 1992; It was described by \"CD Review\" as \"a peculiar mixture of ornate and wicked little bits about suicide, strippers, and a disgruntled ex-postal worker\". It would be over three years before the bands's next studio album, \"Pure Acid Park\", although a (mostly) live album, \"Dry-Humping the Cash Cow\", came out in 1994.\n\nThe band decided to call it a day after playing their 1,000th show, in London on November 25, 1995, and confirmed the split in February 1996. The band's many shows between 1988 and 1996 included tours of the United States, Europe, and Japan, including a performance at the Reading Festival in 1993.\n\nMoses went on to briefly join Rasputina, while Antona and Schulmeister got married and relocated to Durham, North Carolina.\n\nIn 2001 Alice Donut started recording and writing again and in 2003 \"Three Sisters\", their first release after their hiatus, was recorded as a four-piece with Tom Antona on vocals, Michael Jung on guitar, Stephen Moses on drums and Sissi Schulmeister on bass.\n\nGuitarist Dave Giffen rejoined the group for \"Fuzz\", which was recorded in Brooklyn's BC Studio with longtime co-producer Martin Bisi, mixed and engineered by Joel Hamilton, and released on September 5, 2006.\n\nThe band's tenth studio album followed, \"Ten Glorious Animals\", released in September 2009, again on Alternative Tentacles.\n\nIn 2011, the band's 25th anniversary was marked with the documentary \"Freaks in Love\". In 2012 the \"Freaks in love\" compilation was released. Alice Donut still performs live on some occasions, like a show in 2014 in France and 2017 in Baltimore, MD at Ottobar.\n\nOn November 11, 2016 Tomas Antona stated on Facebook that Alice Donut are writing a new album. No completion or release date was given.\n\nThe band has been described as \"punk...with elements of oddball country and funk\" by Allmusic writer John Bush, and as \"abstract metal\" by Andrew Earles. \"The New Yorker\" described the band as a \"dadaist punk ensemble\" playing \"oddball psychedelic noise-rock with a spiky sense of humor\". \"Trouser Press\" described the band as \"a little bit Zappa, a little bit cacophonous punk\", calling it \"a belated East Coast response to the Dickies and Redd Kross\". Critics also drew comparisons with artists such as Butthole Surfers, Frank Zappa, and G.G. Allin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There's a Curious Lump in My Sack\" (2004), Punkervision\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Black Mountain College in 1955 and later wrote a memoir of his time there. He hitchhiked to San Francisco where he encountered the literature of the Beat Generation. Returning to New York, he attended Columbia University and received an MFA in 1971, after which he began teaching writing.\n\nRumaker's first collection was in 1959 in the new-writer showcase \"Short Story 2\", which featured short stories from him and three other authors, including Gertrude Friedberg. His short stories in the book received a favourable review in The New York Times, where he was described as an \"impressive young writer\".\n\nHis first book, \"The Butterfly\", is a fictionalized memoir of his brief affair with a young Yoko Ono, published before Ono became famous. His short stories, \"Gringos and other stories\", appeared in 1967. A revised and expanded version appeared in 1991. He began to write directly about his life as a gay man in the volumes \"A Day and a Night at the Baths\" (1979) and \"My First Satyrnalia\" (1981). The novel \"Pagan Days\" (1991) is told from the perspective of an eight-year-old boy struggling to understand his gay self. \"Black Mountain Days\", a memoir of his time at Black Mountain College, has a strong autobiographical element. In addition, there are portraits of many students and faculty (including the poets Robert Creeley, Charles Olson and Jonathan Williams) during its last years, 1952-1956.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Black Mountain College, Rumaker made his way to the post-Howl, pre-Stonewall riots gay literary milieu of San Francisco, where he entered the circle of Robert Duncan. His account of that time in the book \"Robert Duncan in San Francisco\", first published by Donald Allen at his Grey Fox Press, gives an unvarnished look at the premier poet of the San Francisco Renaissance. Rumaker will release previously unpublished letters between himself and Robert Duncan for a new edition, published by City Lights.\n\n"}

His style of furniture design is regarded as one of the most elegant of its time.\n\nChapin was born in Massachusetts; his family were woodworkers, and he too entered the trade. In his early 20s, he was named in a paternity suit by Hannah Bartlett. Although he denied the suit, he settled with Bartlett by deeding a tract of land over to her. Probably as a result, in 1767 he moved to Philadelphia, a colonial center of fine furniture construction, to further study his craft. In the 18th century, Philadelphia was one of the most important cities both before and after the American Revolution and was a center of style and culture. At age 30, he returned to Connecticut, building a home and workshop in East Windsor where he spent the rest of his life, operating his furniture making shop from 1771 through 1798.\n\nIn contrast to the general style of his contemporary Connecticut furniture makers, which was tall and slim, with long slim legs, Chapin had a style which was more compact, blocky, and chunky, but lighter and cleaner in detail than the Philadelphia rococo design from which he also drew inspiration, resulting in a style known as Connecticut Chippendale. The detail work on his furniture was also consistent and distinctive, with similar very highly detailed carvings on the ball and claw feet of his furniture, similar distinctive spiral rosettes, open fretwork, scrolled pediments, and other decorations. This makes his pieces identifiable, even though he did not sign them or apply a maker's mark. The quality of construction extended even to invisible parts of the furniture; interiors and undersides of drawers were finished just as meticulously as the exteriors, pieces of wood were dovetailed together almost seamlessly, and no pegs or nails are showing in the finished work. \n\nEliphalet's second cousin or nephew Aaron Chapin also worked in Eliphalet's shop between 1774 and 1783. In the 1930s, a debate raged through the furniture scholar community over whether Aaron or Eliphalet was the real mastermind behind the style; the reluctance of either to sign their pieces (no signed piece by Eliphalet and only a few by Aaron have ever been found) has led to over a century of arguing about which Chapin was the actual builder behind any specific piece. It is currently believed, however, that Eliphalet was indeed the driving force, and his work is the more highly prized (and conversely, the more highly prized works are assumed to be by him).\n\nEast Windsor marriage records show that Eliphalet was married to Mary Darling on November 25, 1773, and to \"Anne Read of Canterbury\" on June 18, 1778; and that Aaron married Mary King on September 15, 1777. He died in East Windsor, Connecticut.\n\n"}

In 1705 Lewenhaupt won the Battle of Gemauerthof and was appointed Governor of Riga. In 1708, he was ordered to march east with a supply column, to support Charles's primary invasion force in Russia. This led to the Battle of Lesnaya (1708), in which he was defeated and forced to abandon his supplies. In 1709, after having connected with the King's army, Lewenhaupt was given command of the infantry at the disastrous Battle of Poltava (1709) and the Surrender at Perevolochna.

{"id": "2191813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191813", "title": "Darkstar (Marvel Comics)", "text": "Darkstar (Marvel Comics)\n\nDarkstar (Laynia Petrovna) is a fictional character, a mutant superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She has been a member of various super-teams in her career, including X-Corporation and Champions of Los Angeles.\n\nDarkstar first appeared in \"Champions\" #7 (August 1976), and was created by Tony Isabella and George Tuska. She became a regular character in \"Champions\" for the remainder of the series's brief run, though she never actually joins the titular supergroup. A memo from series writer Bill Mantlo reveals that he intended her to be a \"floating\" member who would come and go from the book as the occasion called for.\n\nLaynia Petrovna and her twin brother Nikolai Krylenko were born in Minsk. When she grew up, she became a special operative of the Soviet government.\n\nDarkstar joins a Soviet super-team recruited to bring Natasha Romanoff (the Black Widow) back to the USSR. She turns sides, and then fights alongside the Champions. Champion Iceman is smitten with her, but Laynia does not reciprocate his feelings. She helps the Champions on a few more missions before returning to Russia, leaving behind a devastated Iceman.\n\nDarkstar becomes a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers with her brother Nikolai (alias Vanguard) and the Crimson Dynamo. The Soviet Super-Soldiers battle Iron Man and Jack of Hearts on the moon, but wind up helping them against renegade Rigellians led by Commander Arcturus. Helping the very people they were sent to stop became a habit for the group.\n\nLater, Darkstar and Vanguard are sent along with new Soviet Super-Soldier Ursa Major by the KGB to defeat Sergei the Presence. Darkstar and Vanguard learn that Sergei is their father, and that Professor Phobos had exploited the Super-Soldiers. Darkstar aids in freeing Sergei and Starlight, and defeating Phobos.\n\nThe Soviet Super-Soldiers are then sent by the Soviet government to Khystym to battle the Gremlin. They fight the Spaceknights Rom and Starshine, but later ally with them against the Dire Wraiths. The Super-Soldiers wind up befriending the Gremlin instead of fighting him.\n\nLater, the Soviet Super-Soldiers agree to help bring Magneto to justice. They fight the Avengers, but turned against the Crimson Dynamo when it turns out that he had been manipulating events.\n\nThe Soviet Super-Soldiers Darkstar, Vanguard, and Ursa Major defect to the United States seeking political asylum. They arrive at Avengers Island, asking for Captain America's help. They are beaten nearly to death by the Supreme Soviets, who had disguised themselves as members of the Avengers. The comatose subconscious minds of the Super-Soldiers form a \"Great Beast\" that follows the Supreme Soviets back to the USSR and tries to kill them. Captain America persuades the \"Great Beast\" to stand down, and the three Super-Soldiers later regain consciousness and recover from their injuries.\n\nThe Soviet Super-Soldiers are captured and returned to the Soviet Union. They are rescued by Blind Faith and the Exiles (not to be confused with the reality-hopping team the Exiles), whom she joins.\n\nWhen the Supreme Soviets (who had changed their name to People's Protectorate) are rechristened the Winter Guard, Darkstar is recruited back into the team. After that team also disbands, Darkstar and Vanguard team with a Russian mutant team, and later join forces with their father, the Presence.\n\nAfter Vanguard dies on the Starbrand mission led by Quasar, Darkstar and her father Sergei decide to kill Quasar, who allows them to believe that they have succeeded while he has in fact left earth.\n\nDarkstar joins the Paris branch of X-Corporation, in which she is possessed by Weapon XII, a creation of the Weapon Plus Project, and subsequently killed by Fantomex. A funeral is held at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where she is buried.\n\nDarkstar is temporarily resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve in Selene's army of deceased mutants during their assault on the mutant nation of Utopia.\n\nA new, red-haired Darkstar first appeared as a member of the Winter Guard in \"Hulk\" #1. Her name is Sasha Roerich. She was genetically modeled to resemble the previous Darkstar. After being again altered by The Presence, her body betrays itself, and she is transformed into a multi-tentacled Darkforce beast. She is killed by Red Guardian.\n\nWith Sasha's death, Reena Stanicoff takes over the role. Reena is killed during an attack on Winter Guard headquarters by a Dire Wraith, who then begins to assume her form. Although the Winter Guard fights off the attack, Reena's death is subsequently covered up by the government.\n\nThe Dire Wraith who assumed Reena's form is suddenly overwhelmed and taken over by darkforce energy. The original Darkstar (Laynia Petrovna) seizes control of the creature and resurrects herself. She reunites with her brother Vanguard and returns to active duty alongside her brother and Ursa Major. She fights Hyperion.\n\nLaynia, along with the other members of the Winter Guard, is blasted into space by the Intelligencia, yet survives.\n\nDarkstar is present when the Winter Guard is brought back together.\n\nDarkstar is a mutant who can psionically access the extra-dimensional energy of the Darkforce dimension, which grants her a number of superhuman abilities. She is connected to the Darkforce dimension by means of her consciousness being split between her physical body and a Darkforce representation of same, both symbiotically linked. Darkstar can thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. She can cause Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. She may project Darkforce as simple, mentally-controlled solid objects, possessing the density of steel, such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as a beam of concussive force. If Darkstar is rendered unconscious any Darkforce constructs of her making immediately dissipate. Darkstar can teleport herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and travelling through it. The maximum distance she can teleport has never been revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disorients her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinds her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner is risky.\n\nDarkstar can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the Darkforce dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth's gravity. The upper limits of her powers are still unknown.\n\nDarkstar is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the KGB, and by the Black Widow. She is fluent in both Russian and English.\n\nWhile the original Darkstar's costume was designed by the Soviet government and was made of a synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, the other two Darkstars had costumes composed of Darkforce material.\n\nDarkstar is seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.\n\nDifferent versions of Darkstar have been encountered by the Exiles:\n\n\n\n"}

It is similar to the GTPS (Government Telephone Preference Scheme) for landlines.\n\nThis scheme allowed the mobile telephone networks to restrict access in a specific area to registered numbers only and is normally invoked by the Police Incident Commander (although it can be invoked by the Cabinet Office). The emergency services are responsible for registering their key numbers in advance.\n\nACCOLC was replaced by MTPAS (Mobile Telecommunication Privileged Access Scheme) in 2009.\n\nThe purpose of ACCOLC (US) was to restrict non-essential access to cellular phone networks during emergencies. This actively prevents unnecessary usage from congesting the cell networks, thus allowing emergency services personnel priority for communications. It also serves to control information flow in and out of a declared emergency area.\n\nMobile networks can become overwhelmed by a high concentration of calls that often occur immediately after a major incident. Reliable access to the mobile networks, even during times when an exceptionally large number of calls are being made, is achieved by installing a special SIM (subscriber identity module) card in the telephone handset. Special SIMs are only available to entitled users within the emergency services community, and not to members of the public.\n\nVerizon Wireless in the United States has also implemented ACCOLC on its wireless networks, the modalities of use may differ from those in Britain especially with regards to ACCOLC being activated permanently on the network.\n\nIn an emergency situation, the mobile network operator can implement ACCOLC onto specific mobile cell sites (that cover the area of the required restriction). Most systems allow the operator to allow/restrict specific Access Class levels to gain access to the cell sites. \nThe customer's SIM card is provisioned with an Access Class level between 0 and 15. Most SIM cards will be coded with a random access class level between 0 and 9. For special case mobile customers - e.g. emergency services, government officials, civil defence, etc. they will be issued with a SIM card with a high access class value (between 10 and 15).\nWhen the mobile operator needs to implement ACCOLC restriction, they will update the configuration on the specified cell sites. The access class value is a field that is transmitted in the broadcast channel of the cell. Under normal conditions, access class levels 0 - 15 are allowed. The SIM card compares what is allowed to its own access class level. If the allowed access class levels being broadcast by the cell site does not match what is on the SIM card, then the mobile device cannot access that cell - for any services.\n\nACCOLC was deployed at the Hillsborough disaster.\n\n\n"}

It generally lives in shallow waters with muddy bottoms.\n\nThis fish has a maximum size that sources say are between two and three feet.\n\nThe giraffe-like pattern will fade with age to a two-tone mottled brown. Various subspecies have been described for this fish, indicating some geographical variation in coloration.\n\nEggs are scattered in a nest and guarded by the male. \"Dinotopterus cunningtoni\" takes advantage of the care and allows the male giraffe catfish to care for its eggs and young, an example of interspecific brood care.\n\nThe giraffe catfish is occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Because of its large eventual size and its fast rate of growth, it is inappropriate for smaller aquaria.

{"id": "2191836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191836", "title": "Ocotea", "text": "Ocotea\n\nOcotea is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lauraceae. Many are evergreen trees with lauroid leaves.\n\nThere are 428 species currently accepted within the genus, distributed mostly in tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas (around 300 species) including the Caribbean and West Indies, but also with some species in Africa, Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. One species (\"O. foetens\") is native to the Macaronesia (in Canary Islands and Madeira).\n\nThey are trees or shrubs, occasionally with adventitious roots (\"O. hartshorniana\", \"O. insularis\"). Leaves simple, alternate, rarely opposite or whorled. The leaves are lauroid, they are commonly dark green glossy with sometimes brown on the underside and fragrant oil cells.\n\nThe African and Madagascan species all have bisexual flowers (possessing both male and female parts), whereas many of the American species have flowers that are unisexual (either male or female).\nThe apetalous flowers are in small panicles.\n\nThe fruits are globose or oblong berries, 3–5 cm in length, hard and fleshy and at the junction of the peduncle part with the fruit covered by a cup-shaped, occasionally flat, cupule, giving them an appearance similar to an acorn. The fruit is dark green, gradually darkening with maturity. The cupule at the base of the berry, can be more brightly colored. The fruit has a single seed wrapped in a hard coat and can be slightly lignified.\n\nThe genus has no standard common name. Names often refer to the aroma of the wood, which can be strong and not always pleasant. Sweetwood is usually applied only to this genus, although many names are also applied to this genus and other genera:\n\nThe common names of some species refer to their similarity to other Lauraceae such as \"Sassafras\" (Brazilian sassafras: \"O. odorifera\") or \"Laurus\" (Cape laurel: \"O. bullata\", Sword laurel: \"O. floribunda\", Guaika laurel: \"O. puberula\", etc.).\n\n\"Ocotea\" species are distributed in subtropical and tropical regions, often at higher altitudes. They are characteristic plants of many tropical montane habitats such as Araucaria moist forests, Laurisilva, Afromontane biomes, Knysna-Amatole montane forests and Talamancan montane forests, although in Madagascar and Brazil they also occur in lowland forests.\nMost relatively small fruit species are of great environmental importance because they are the food of many endemic birds and mammals, especially in Islands, and premontane and montane forests. The leaves of \"Ocotea\" species are the food source for the caterpillars of several species of endemic Lepidoptera, including several species of \"Memphis\". Some \"Memphis\" caterpillars feed solely on the leaves of one species of \"Ocotea\"; for example \"M. mora\" feeds only on \"O. cernua\", and \"M. boisduvali\" feeds only on \"O. veraguensis\"\n\nSeed distribution of some \"Ocotea\" species is performed by frugivorous birds such as toucans, the three-wattled bellbird (family Cotingidae), quetzal and Cape parrot. \"Ocotea\" fruit is also consumed by several Columbiformes such as \"Columba trocaz\", Delegorgue's pigeon, Bolle's pigeon (\"Columba bollii\"), African wood pigeon, and American doves.\n\nMost of the African tree species are ancient paleoendemic species, which in ancient times were widely distributed on the continent. This is not the case in the Americas: 89 species have been collected in Venezuela alone.\n\nSpecies of \"Ocotea\" can be attacked by various rot-inducing root pathogens, including \"Loweporus inflexibilis\", \"Phellinus apiahynus\" and \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\".\n\nSome \"Ocotea\" species are used as nesting sites by ants, which may live in leaf pockets or in hollowed-out stems. The ants patrol their host plants more frequently in response to disturbance or to the appearance of insect pests such as grasshoppers.\n\n\"Ocotea\" produce essential oils, which are rich in camphor and safrole. East African camphorwood (\"O. usambarensis\"), Peruvian rosewood (\"O. cernua\") and Brazilian sassafras (\"O. odorifera\") are traded internationally.\n\nDried fruit cupules of ishpingo (\"O. quixos\") are used in Ecuador to flavor beverages, such as colada morada.\n\nSome fast growing \"Ocotea\" tree species are harvested commercially for timber. These include \"O. puberula\", \"O. bullata\" (black or true stinkwood) and \"O. usambarensis\". The timber is valued for its resistance to fungal decay.\n\n\"O. odorifera\" (Brazilian sassafras) and \"O. kuhlmanni\" are frequently used as honey plants.\n\nThe following are some of the species of \"Ocotea\". Distinguishing \"Ocotea\" species from \"Nectandra\" and other close relatives is problematic. \"Povedadaphne\" may be better placed in \"Ocotea\".\n\n†\"Ocotea hradekensis\" from the early Miocene, has been described from fragmentary fossil leaf compressions that have been found in the Kristina Mine at Hrádek nad Nisou in North Bohemia, the Czech Republic. \"O. foetens\" from the Canary Islands is its nearest living relative. Fossil †\"Ocotea heerii\" leaf impressions of Messinian age (ca. 5.7 Ma) have been uncovered in Monte Tondo, northern Apennines, Italy.\n"}
