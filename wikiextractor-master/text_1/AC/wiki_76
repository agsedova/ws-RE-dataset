{"id": "2152984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152984", "title": "Daniel Coughlin", "text": "Daniel Coughlin\n\nFr. Daniel P. Coughlin, STL, (born November 8, 1934) served as the 59th Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives from March 23, 2000, to April 14, 2011. He was the first Roman Catholic priest to serve in that position, and the process that led to his selection included some controversy. However, as a \"Washington Post\" article pointed out in 2010, on the occasion of Coughlin's tenth anniversary in the House Chaplain position, \"there is ample evidence that the rancor that accompanied his selection has disappeared: Last week, lawmakers from both parties streamed onto the House floor to honor his decade of service.\"\n\nCoughlin was born November 8, 1934, in Illinois.\n\nThe son of Dan and Lucille Coughlin, he was raised on the North side of Chicago and graduated from St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Mundelein, Illinois, with a degree in Theology. Coughlin was ordained for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago on May 3, 1960. In 1968 he received a degree in Pastoral Studies from Loyola University, Chicago.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990 Coughlin was pastor at St. Francis Xavier Parish in La Grange, Illinois. He then became Director of the Cardinal Stritch Retreat House in Mundelein, Illinois. In 1995 he began working as Vicar for Priests of the Archdiocese of Chicago under Joseph Bernardin and later Francis George. His work both at the retreat house and in his role as Vicar for Priests—a position that included offering pastoral care to priests, including those involved in sexual abuse cases—would later lead to accusations of impropriety (that he was somehow involved with the overall problem of covering up sex crimes within the Catholic Church) later in his career.\n\nCoughlin's role was, in his words, a \"pastor for priests,\" helping priests \"comply with whatever protocols the archdiocese mandated,\" rather than making decisions about how accused priests should be managed. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights called any allegations of wrongdoing on Coughlin's part a \"witch hunt.\" Coughlin held the position of Vicar for Priests until he was sworn in as House Chaplain.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, during a sabbatical from his work in Illinois, he lived and worked with Trappist monks in Kentucky's Gethsemani Abbey, and worked in India with Calcutta's Missionaries of Charity. He has also served on numerous national and international committees focusing on the subjects of spirituality and renewal in prayer, and served as a scholar-in-residence at the North American College in Rome. He is also a contributor to \"The Spiritual Renewal of the American Priesthood,\" a publication of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nThe selection of the 59th Chaplain of the House of Representatives was a controversial process prior to Coughlin's eventual selection. Then House Speaker Dennis Hastert appointed a bipartisan search committee made up of 18 congressional members to recommend a new chaplain to him, but when that committee reportedly recommended a Roman Catholic priest, Father Timothy O'Brien (selected by secret ballot after consideration of more than 50 applicants and nominees for the position), Hastert chose Presbyterian minister Charles Parker Wright instead.\n\nIn a \"personal privilege\" address to Congress on March 20, 2009, Hastert denied that O'Brien's name was given to him as the first choice of the committee, instead saying that O'Brien's name was the first of the final three names submitted to him because the names were in alphabetical order, not numerical ranking.\n\nHastert's decision not to select O'Brien led to accusations of anti-Catholic bias, and ultimately resulted in Rev. Wright's decision to withdraw his name from consideration. Press reports of Hastert's \"surprise compromise selection of a Chicago Catholic priest\" covered the story of the Speaker's decision as a way of defusing the controversy.\n\nHastert, a native of and representative from Illinois, had his staff reach out to Chicago's Archbishop, Francis Cardinal George, for a recommendation of a priest to fill the role of House Chaplain.\n\nDaniel Coughlin, Cardinal George's recommendation and Hastert's ultimate selection, was described as a 65-year-old \"gentle, soft-spoken priest,\" who said he was \"blown away\" by the news that he had been \"plucked out of obscurity for the job and thrust into the middle of a political maelstrom.\" Responding to a reporter's comment that he was being thrown into a \"lion's den,\" Coughlin noted that perhaps it was fitting that his name was \"Daniel.\"\n\nHastert formally interviewed Coughlin on March 13, 2000, and Coughlin was sworn in as the fifty-ninth Chaplain of the House of Representatives on March 23, beginning his service with the 106th Congress. Since he was named while congress was in session, he served as Acting Chaplain throughout the remainder of the 106th Congress, formally elected to a full term as House Chaplain on January 3, 2001, when the 107th Congress convened.\n\nAs House Chaplain, Coughlin opened every session with a prayer, either delivering it himself or coordinating the service of a guest chaplain (often nominated by members of the House, representing their home districts). Coughlin has noted that \"Welcoming guest chaplains is one of the very rewarding things I do. It shows the breadth and depth of the religious experience in the U.S., and is a shining beacon of religious liberty.\" He has also shared his belief in \"prayer and the power of prayer,\" and its power to \"bring about change in the nation's capital.\"\n\nAs House Chaplain, he also offered and coordinated pastoral counseling to the House community, and his office coordinated a website with information about worship services and upcoming special events in the areas of religion and faith in the Capitol Hill and Washington, D.C., area.\n\nCoughlin has noted that he \"sensed how deeply lawmakers value prayer and the presence of the chaplain in the halls of Congress\" after the September 11 attacks. He has noted that his understanding of this need brought \"a further gravity to his duties.\"\n\nCoughlin has sometimes referred to the \"House family,\" to which he offers pastoral care regardless of the religions of its members and staffers, or whether individuals identify with a religious faith at all. For example, during the 110th Congress, when six House members died, Coughlin sensed the pain of Congress, even while he worked with families and ceremonies linked to this unusually high number of deaths.\n\nHe has spoken of a special pain on the part of Catholic members during debates within the Catholic Church over withholding Holy Communion from public officials whose votes (especially votes that could be interpreted as \"pro-choice\") were interpreted as being antithetical to Church teaching.\n\nReferring to such debates as \"very upsetting,\" Coughlin said that he \"talked to members of the hierarchy on that as well as members of the House,\" telling Church leaders that he would \"stay with my people whatever you do. I will be with my people whatever you do. I will hear them out. I will be with them.\" Coughlin has called this situation – the threat of using the liturgy \"as a threat\" – \"one of the saddest stories I heard.\"\n\nWhen asked whether a Catholic priest with his own theological beliefs can minister to the spiritual needs of men and women of all faiths, he acknowledged his own \"limitations\". Therefore, he met with ministers, rabbis, and other religious leaders to \"refer members of Congress to people who speak their spiritual language.\" He also noted that \"We have many more common concerns than differences,\" and that many conversations are not linked to any one religion's theological beliefs.\n\nCoughlin's service to the members and staffs of the House have earned him praise from both sides of the aisle. In 2010, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi described him by saying that \"He has seen us through the dark and through the bright,\" and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) confessed to being \"a better person for having known Father Coughlin and having been counseled by him.\" Representative Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.) called him \"an inspiration.\"\n\nHis awards and recognitions include the Distinguished Service Award from the Washington Theological Union in October 2006, the Alumni Extraordinary Service Award from the Institute of Pastoral Studies at Loyola University, and an Honorary Doctorate in Theology from Lewis University. In addition, House Resolution 1216, introduced in 2010 by Congressman Dan Lipinski to honor Coughlin's first ten years as House Chaplain, was passed by a vote of 412-0. In 2002 he received the John F. Kennedy National Award by the Saint Patrick's Committee of Holyoke, MA, presented annually to an American of Irish descent who has distinguished oneself in one's chosen field.\n\nA search for Coughlin's successor as House Chaplain was begun shortly before his retirement, with final approval in the hands of House Speaker John Boehner. In a 2011 audio interview with \"America magazine\" conducted two weeks before his retirement, Coughlin asked that citizens not only pray for all congressional members \"by name,\" but also pray for the new House Chaplain.\n\nCoughlin noted that \"If the chaplain is not a man of prayer -- or a person of prayer -- and a person of peace, we're good for nobody.\" On May 6, 2011, an announcement was made that Fr. Patrick J. Conroy was nominated to be the 60th Chaplain of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n"}

In addition, Rehman served as a law professor in the faculty of Karachi University and vice-chancellor of University of Dhaka while remaining active in promoting literacy across the country. After the independence of Bangladesh, Rehman's family retained Pakistan's citizenship and his son served as the Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court.\n\nChief Justice Rahman remained a very respected figure in Pakistan's judiciary, and is hailed for his honesty and patriotism that Senior Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday once publicly noted that \"his Commission was the most honorable commission that was investigated by a Bengali Chief Justice, in spite of East-Pakistan disaster.\" His findings could prove to be disastrous for Pakistan's powerful military so they never made public.\n\nHamoodur Rahman was born in Patna, Bihar, British India on 1 November 1910. Despite being born in Bihar, Rahman hailed from an Bengali Muslim family. Hamoodur Rahman's family practised law before the Partition of India— his brother, Maudoodur Rahman, was also a barrister who ascended as a Judge of Calcutta High Court. His father, Khan Bahadur Dr. Dawood ur Rahman was the first Muslim civil surgeon in undivided India to do FRCS form Royal College London. He was the personal surgeon to the Emir of Kuwait. His father in law, Nawabzada Ashraf Ali was a barrister who was an practising advocate in the Calcutta High Court. Ashraf Ali later participated in general elections held in 1930 and was a member of Bengal Legislative Assembly. Ali later served as deputy speaker of the Bengal Legislative Assembly before the Partition of India.\n\nHamoodur Rahman was educated in Calcutta and entered in the St. Xavier's College of the University of Calcutta where he secured his graduation in BA. He went to the Great Britain to attend the University of London where he graduated with the LLB degree and resume his studies in Gray's Inn, London, and was called to the Bar in London in 1937.\n\nUpon arriving to British India, Rehman began practising law at the Calcutta High Court in 1938 and served as the legal councillor of the Calcutta Corporation in 1940. In 1943, he also presented Mayor of Calcutta as its legal councillor, and was a member of the Junior Standing Counsel of the East Bengal from 1943 to 1947.

In 2007, his son refused to take an oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order issued by President Pervez Musharraf who imposed the Emergency in November 2007. After his restoration in 2009, he resumed hearing cases at the Lahore High Court and eventually ascended as Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court in 2013.\n\nJustice Hamoodur Rahman served as a judge of the Dhaka High Court from 1954 until 1960 when he was appointed as Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan by the President of Pakistan. In addition, Rahman served as the vice-chancellor of Dhaka University from 11 May 1958 until 14 December 1960 while serving as visiting professor of law at the Karachi University.\n\nDuring his career as Senior Justice at the Supreme Court, Rehman held various dignified positions and engaged himself in promoting the literacy across the country. From 1959 to 1960, he was a member of International Court of Arbitration that is based in the Hague, Netherlands. In 1964, Rehman, upon requested by the Ministry of Education (MoEd), led the \"Commission on Students Problems and Welfare\" as its chairman where he authored the report and submitted the case study recommendations to the Government of Pakistan in 1966. In 1967, he was the member of the \"Law Reforms Commission\" that conducted the various case studies on land reforms in Pakistan on behalf of Ministry of Law (MoL)– its report was submitted in 1970 to the President of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1968, Senior Justice Hamoodur Rehman was nominated as Chief Justice by outgoing Chief Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius; his appointment as Chief Justice was approved by President Ayub Khan. His tenure witnessed the resignation of President Ayub Khan who invited Yahya Khan to take over the country through enforcing the martial law in 1969. He heard the petition filed by Asma Jillani against Yahya Khan's takeover in case known as \"\"Asma Jillani vs. Government of the Punjab.\"\" Upon hearing the case, Hamoodur Rahman court retroactively invalidated the martial law that suspended the Constitution and notably ruled that Yahya Khan's assumption of power was \"illegal usurpation\". The Supreme Court also over-ruled and overturned its convictions that called for validation of martial law in 1958.\n\nChief Justice Hamoodur Rehman carefully distinguish the meaning of martial law in terms of controlling the internal disorder and imposing the martial law in alien territory. His stance stood firm against Yahya Khan's martial law but condone such actions by the application of doctrine of necessity. In 1970, he supported the Election Commission of Pakistan to held the general elections held in 1970 across the country.\n\nHamoodur Rahman, remained loyal to Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and the war with India in 1971. He did not supported the independence of Bangladesh and remained quiet throughout the events. He administrated the oath of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as President of Pakistan on 22 April 1971 at the Supreme Court building.\n\nIn 1972–73, he went onto work with the United Nation and was a member of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. Chief Justice Justice Hamoodur Rahman retired with state honours in 1975 and administrated the oath to appoint Senior Justice Muhammad Yaqub Ali as Chief Justice.\n\nIn 1974, he was the chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) until retiring in 1977.\n\nIn 1971, President Zulfikar Bhutto constituted a commission to investigate the of the war with India that led the liberation of East Pakistan and to provide insightful recommendations to prevent future armed foreign intervention. The commission, known as War Enquiry Commission (or otherwise known as Hamoodur Rahman Commission), was led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rehman as its chairman and consisted of both civilian and military members.\n\nInitially, Chief Justice Rahman was tasked to investigate the causes and the break-up of Pakistan, and role of the Pakistan Armed Forces in the national politics. His report revealed many aspects of politics in Pakistan Armed Forces during the East-Pakistan war. Because of the nature of the findings, it was not declassified for decades until an Indian newspapers, later Pakistani newspapers, published the details.\n\nFrom 1971 until 1975, the Commission led by Rahman conducted several interviews of Pakistan military's senior officers, bureaucrats, politicians, activists, and the Bengali nationalists. Criticism on the government and misconduct of civilian politicians were very heavy and intense, therefore, the Report was never made it public in Pakistan and concealed all of its information as the report was marked as \"Top secret\".\n\nThe report explores a number of issues such as, killing of thousands of East Pakistanis—both civilians and \"Bengali\" soldiers—rape, pan smuggling, looting of banks in East Pakistan, drunkenness by military officers, even an instance of a one star rank officer \"entertaining\" women while their troops were being shelled by Indian troops. The Report recommended a string of courts-martial and military trials against the top senior military officers including the PAF's Air Marshal Enamul Haq (the AOC of Eastern Air Command of Pakistan Air Force), Vice-Admiral Mohammad Shariff( Fleet Commander of the Eastern Naval Command of Pakistan Navy), and Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan (the GOC of Eastern Army Command of Pakistan Army), and former generals such as Amir Khan Niazi and Rao Farman Ali.\n\nDespite recommending field courts-martial by the Commission, there were no actions taken by Prime Minister Bhutto or the successive governments. Nearly 300 individuals were interviewed and hundreds of classified armed forces military signals were examined, with the final comprehensive Report was submitted on 23 October 1974 by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman who submitted the report to Prime minister Secretariat.\n\nOriginally, the Commission was to overlook the military failure to prevent the break–up of Eastern Pakistan but Chief Justice Rahman went into great depths in the roots of matter since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. A separate chapter on the political history of Pakistan was very detailed oriented and written by Chief Justice Rahman who critically opined on the political role of Zulfikar Bhutto. Rahman critically opined on Bhutto and, with some degree, implicated Bhutto of manipulating President Yahya Khan to take the military action as a solution.\n\nHe noted that President Yahya Khan failed to seek a sincere political settlement with East Pakistan. Though the responsibility of the debacle lay on the shoulders of the people in power then as was recommended in the report by Chief Justice Rahman.\n\nWhen the report was submitted the then Prime Minister Bhutto, the Prime minister wrote to the chairman War Enquiry Commission Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, that the commission has exceeded its limits. The Commission was appointed to look into the military \"aspect of debacle\", not the aspect of political failure; therefore, Bhutto classified the publications of the Commission and marked its report as \"Top Secret\".\n\nIn 1974, the final Report was submitted but both Bhutto and President Zia-ul-Haq claimed that the report was lost and was nowhere to be located in the National Archives of Pakistan.\n\nIn the 1990s, it was revealed through investigative journalism by \"News International\" that the Report was suppressed and was held secretly at the Joint staff HQ in Rawalpindi. In 2000, portion of the Report was leaked equally by the \"India Today\" and the \"Dawn\". However, the \"India Today\" wilfully suppressed its own publications as if the surrender was its own scandal.\n\nHamoodur Rahman lived a very quiet life in Lahore and remained active in the Supreme Court. He was appointed the Chairman of Islamic Ideology after his retirement for 3 years, later he was appointed as an advisor to the President of Pakistan on constitutional affairs. He also conducted a commission on election reforms and proposed the proportional representation system existing in Germany, Sri Lanka and many other countries. In which it can be accessed via the library to publish judicial supplements. He died in Lahore due to a cardiac arrest on 20 December 1981. He was buried in Lahore with close judicial associates and friends attending his funeral.\n\nChief Justice Rahman remained a very respected in Pakistan's judiciary even after his death, and is hailed for his honesty and patriotism that Senior Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday once publicly noted that \"his Commission was the most honorable commission that was investigated by a Bengali Chief Justice, in spite of East-Pakistan disaster\", in 2010.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2153006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153006", "title": "Sobhuza I", "text": "Sobhuza I\n\nSobhuza I (also known as Ngwane IV, Somhlolo) (ca. 1780–1836) was king of Eswatini, from 1815 to 1836. Born around 1780, his father was Ndvungunye (also known as \"Zikodze\"), and his mother was Somnjalose Simelane. He was called Somhlolo, \"the Wonder,\" upon his birth because his father Ndvungunye died as a result of being struck by lightning. When Sobhuza was king, Lojiba Simelane instead of his mother Somnjalose was Queen Mother because Somnjalose was an \"inhlanti\" or support bride to Lojiba. Somhlolo is a greatly revered king of Eswatini. He had his first royal capital or kraal at Zombodze in the Shiselweni region, but moved it north to new Zombodze in central Eswatini. Swazis celebrate Somhlolo Day every September 6 as their Independence Day and the national stadium is named Somhlolo stadium. Sobhuza was succeeded by his son Mswati II and his wife Tsandzile Ndwandwe as Queen Mother after a short regency by Queen Lojiba Simelane. Sobhuza by the time of his death a conquered a country claimed to be reaching modern day Barberton in the north, Carolina in the west, Pongola River in the south and Lubombo Mountains in the east.\n\nSobhuza's mother Somnjalose was the younger sister and \"inhlanti\" co-wife to her elder sister Lojiba Simelane, Ndvungunye's senior wife. Lojiba had no male children herself. Sobhuza, as son of her sister co-wife, was considered Lojiba's classificatory son under Ngwane royal kinship and succession principles. While Sobhuza thus became Ndvungunye's heir and successor, Lojiba rather than Somnjalose became \"Indlovukati\" or \"Queen Mother\" upon his accession.\n\nThe reign of Sobhuza I marked a crucial phase in the history of Eswatini. As Sobhuza began his reign, KaNgwane was a realm centered in territory along the Pongola River to the south of modern Swaziland, whose northern reaches encompassed today's southern Swaziland. KaNgwane was ruled by kings of the Dlamini clan, who had earlier ruled an area in and around the Lubombo Mountains to the east. It was only under Sobhuza's grandfather, Ngwane III, ca. 1750, that the Dlamini kings conquered and established the country Sobhuza inherited, incorporating more than a dozen smaller chiefdoms led by chiefs from other clans. Early in Sobhuza's reign, the Ngwane kingdom faced strong risks of conquest by the more powerful Ndwandwe and Zulu kingdoms to the south in the 1810s and 1820s. Sobhuza moved the main royal center northward into what is now Zombodze central Eswatini, with many of his followers relocating as well. The former royal centers in Shiselweni became southern outposts.\n\nAfter moving the center of Dlamini royal power to the north, Sobhuza led the conquest of many local chiefdoms. KaNgwane became a kingdom comparable in scope and power to those of the Zulu, the Maroti kingdom, or the Pedi. Sobhuza I notably married \"inkhosikati\" Tsandzile Ndwandwe the daughter of Zwide Ndwandwe the leader of the powerful Ndwandwe clan south of the Pongola River. The Swazi clans under the leadership of Sobhuza I were constantly in conflict with the Ndwandwe’s. As a result, Sobhuza made an offer to marry one of the daughters of Zwide and establish peace with his neighbors. Sobhuza I had in total three wives, the first of whom, Tsandzile, bore him Mswati II and Mzamose Dlamini. Mswati would eventually succeed him as king.\n\nSobhuza died in 1836 and is buried at the royal burial site at Mbilaneni. Sobhuza left his son Mswati II a country claimed to be reaching modern day Barberton in the north, Carolina in the west, Pongola River in the south and Lubombo Mountains in the east, which is larger than present day Eswatini. The clans that were conquered before and during Sobhuza's tenure are referred to as \"Emakhandzambili\".\n"}

{"id": "2153013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153013", "title": "CKMF-FM", "text": "CKMF-FM\n\nCKMF-FM (94.3 MHz) is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Montreal, Quebec.\n\nOwned and operated by Bell Media, it broadcasts with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 41,400 watts as a Class C1 station, using an omnidirectional antenna from the Mount Royal candelabra tower at 297.4 metres in height above average terrain (HAAT). Its studios and offices are located at the Bell Media Building at 1717 Rene-Levesque Boulevard East in Downtown Montreal.\n\nThe station airs a Hot Adult Contemporary radio format and is the flagship station of the Énergie network, which operates across Quebec. It offers personality DJs playing francophone and anglophone hits from the current charts to the 1980s.\n\nThe station signed on the air on May 11, 1964, as CJMS-FM. It was a sister station to the now-defunct 1280 AM CJMS. Both stations were owned by the Radiomutuel Group. After first simulcasting the AM station, CJMS-FM later aired a classical music format. Classical music ended in 1970 and the call sign was changed to CKMF-FM in May 1, 1971 , airing an automated Top 40 (CHR) format.\n\nThe station moved in 1972 from its original facility at 1700 Berri Street in the Quartier latin to 225 Roy Street East in the Plateau.\n\nIn November 1978, the station became Canada's first radio station with a disco music dedicated segment, heard most evenings (although \"Broadcasting Yearbook\" listed the station's full-time format as Disco). Because of Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rules and the fact that CKMF is a French-language station, it was required to play mostly French-language songs. Therefore English songs (mostly the disco tracks) were spread thinly across the broadcast schedule. The DJ who spun disco music for the first time on Montreal FM Radio was Robert (Bob) Ostiguy during his Saturday night dance show \"Style Libre\" (Free Style), heard from 1974 to 1976. \n\nLater on, Michel Trahan began to include disco music during his afternoon drive time show. \"Le 5 à 8\" became CKMF's most popular show between 1978 and 1986. CKMF concentrated its CRTC quota of English and International music (mostly disco) between the hours of 5-8PM. \"Le 5 à 8\" was hosted by Michel Jasmin and Alain Tanguay, and later by Alain Montpetit and Guy Aubry. The show featured the best disco DJs in Montreal including François L'Herbier, Alain Bourque, Big Dan Moreau and Michel Cadoch, doing shows like \"Live from the Limelight\" and other famous clubs in Montreal. Programs like \"Le Show A Mario,\" with Mario Lirette and DJ Michel Cadoch, gave CKMF 94.3 a unique sound for the Disco era. One of the station's biggest on-air personalities of the disco era was the openly gay Douglas Coco Leopold, whose trademark was his local trendsetting lists of who and what was \"in\" and \"out\" of fashion.\n\nAs was fictionalised in the 2010 Canadian film \"Funkytown\", Montpetit's popularity as an influential DJ and promoter was tarnished by being named as the prime suspect in the 1982 murder of a model in New York City (which would not be confirmed until 2002), and would prompt Leopold to criticize fellow airstaffer Montpetit on air publicly. In 1987, Montpetit died of a drug overdose in Washington, DC, just months after station management fired him after he showed up drunk and appeared too incoherent to do an air shift.\n\nThe station relocated for a final time in 1981 to its current building at 1717 Rene-Levesque Boulevard East (then named Dorchester Boulevard). Its sister station CJMS also moved to the Dorchester/Rene-Levesque building. The move reunited the two stations in the same facility for the first time in a decade as CJMS had never relocated to Roy Street in the 1970s and had instead stayed on Berri ever since.\n\nThe Énergie name began to be used as CKMF transitioned from Rhythmic Top 40 in the 1980s and 1990s, to mainstream Top 40, which began in 1994. In January 2000, Astral Media acquired the assets of Radiomutuel including CKMF.\n\nWhen fourth-adjacent 95.1 CBF-FM increased its power to 100,000 watts (from 17,030 watts), CKMF planned its own a power increase to 75,000 watts. But the boost in power never took place as the expected interference from CBF-FM did not happen. However this plan was notified internationally, which explains why the United States Federal Communications Commission's FM Query webpage erroneous claims that CKMF-FM has a power of 75,000 watts.\n\nThe Énergie branding was discarded in August 2009 when Astral Media licensed the \"NRJ\" branding from a European broadcaster. CKMF's last song as \"Énergie\" was \"Pictures Of You\" by The Last Goodnight, seguing to the station's morning show as the station relaunched as \"NRJ.\" The first song under the \"NRJ\" moniker was \"Beggin'\" by Madcon.\n\nIn 2010, the station became the French-language radio flagship of the Montreal Alouettes CFL football team. The contract was supposed to last until 2013. Both parties were apparently satisfied at the end of the 2010 season. But the contract was terminated as the Alouettes returned to 730 CKAC in time for the 2011 season.\n\nWith the merger of Astral and Bell Media on July 5, 2013, CKMF, as well as all \"NRJ\" stations in Quebec, came under Bell Media ownership.\n\nBy 2011, CKMF began moving away from Top 40/CHR to Adult Top 40 with an emphasis on modern adult contemporary material, which would later evolve into a straight-ahead modern rock presentation by late 2014.\n\nDue to its high cost, Bell Media didn't renew the \"NRJ\" branding, and on August 24, 2015, all Quebec \"NRJ\" stations were rebranded back to the \"Énergie\" moniker, including CKMF. However, CKMF continued the modern rock format, whereas the other \"Énergie\" stations remained Adult Top 40.\n\nIn March 2016, CKMF shifted to Hot Adult Contemporary, while retaining the \"Énergie\" branding, putting it in line with the Énergie stations in other parts of Quebec.\n\nIts programming is simulcast in all Énergie stations evenings, overnights and weekend mornings.\n\n"}

The current multifunction station is only used for emergency stops and maintenance. The portal lies above the tunnel.\n\nPorta Alpina would have been by far the deepest underground train station in the world at underground, outclassing Arsenalna Metro station at . It would also have connected the high-Alpine village of Sedrun and the Surselva to a major high-speed line from northern to southern Europe. The current station, along with Faido, is one of the two multi-function stations of the tunnel.\n\nThe multifunction station is located near a crossover between the northbound and southbound tunnels and is linked to the surface by an elevator, using tall shafts and a long access tunnel, exiting over the Anterior Rhine, south of Sedrun. This access was used for the construction of the tunnel and is now an emergency exit of the tunnel. Construction costs for a fully functional passenger station were estimated at CHF 50M ($39M, €32M, or £22M) in 2005 with annual operating costs of CHF 2.5M. It was initially projected to be opened in 2016 after the Base Tunnel was scheduled to come into service.\n\nProponents of Porta Alpina viewed it both as a potential tourist attraction in its own right, and as a useful transport link to assist the economically challenged Graubünden region. The station would have connected the North/South Gotthard railway line with the East/West Rhaetian Railway/Matterhorn-Gotthard Railway, which would link to the elevator by means of local buses to Sedrun station (MGB) and Disentis station (RhB). This was to have been the fastest public transport link between Zürich and the canton of Graubünden.\nThe project was initially positively received, and the Swiss parliament approved CHF 7.5M of startup funding in 2005. However, further studies indicated substantial problems including the questionable feasibility of the elevators, the negative impact on tunnel rail capacity and the unprofitability of the whole enterprise. The Swiss Federal Council and the government of the canton of Graubünden announced in September 2007 that the project was put on indefinite hold.\n\nFollowing renewed interest by private investors in 2012, the Federal Council decided to forgo construction for the time being, while leaving open the possibility of a similar project being implemented by a later generation. A government report stated that the \"Porta Alpina\" would have reduced the base tunnel's freight capacity (unless a passing loop were built, at a large cost for additional tunnelling) and would have been uneconomical to operate, requiring CHF 9M of annual public subsidies.\n\n"}

{"id": "2153034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153034", "title": "Shout at the Devil (film)", "text": "Shout at the Devil (film)\n\nShout at the Devil is a 1976 British war adventure film directed by Peter R. Hunt and starring Lee Marvin and Roger Moore. The film, set in Zanzibar and German East Africa in 1913–1915, is based on a novel by Wilbur Smith which is very loosely inspired by real events (see the sinking of the SMS \"Königsberg\"). The supporting cast features Barbara Parkins and Ian Holm.\n\nColonel Flynn O'Flynn (Lee Marvin), a hard-drinking American, manipulates British aristocrat Sebastian Oldsmith (Roger Moore) into helping poach ivory in Tanganyika, which is part of the German-controlled pre-World War I territory of German East Africa. On hearing news that the American has returned, Herman Fleischer, the local German Commander of the Southern Provinces, relentlessly hunts O'Flynn with his \"Schutztruppen\" (colonial troops).\n\nLater Sebastian meets and falls in love with O'Flynn's daughter, Rosa (Barbara Parkins). They are married and have a daughter together. Meanwhile the poaching continues. Fleischer has his warship ram and sink O'Flynn's Arab dhow loaded with poached ivory. Later, while attacking O'Flynn's home, \"Schutztruppe\" under Fleischer's command kill Sebastian's daughter Maria.\n\nO'Flynn and Sebastian decide to go and kill Fleischer as revenge for the death of the little girl. But when it is discovered that Britain is at war with Germany, allied officers convince O'Flynn to locate and destroy the German warship awaiting repair.\n\nO'Flynn, Sebastian, and Rosa pursue Fleischer, who happens to be on the warship. Eventually they find her in an inlet and plant a bomb on board. O'Flynn sacrifices himself so that Sebastian and Rosa can escape while Fleischer's crew search for the bomb. Fleischer jumps overboard just in time to get away also, but as he comes ashore, Sebastian kills him with a rifle. Sebastian and Rosa then watch the ship as it is ripped apart by more explosions and burns.\n\n\nThe script was based on a novel by Wilbur Smith. The critic from \"The New York Times\" called the book \"a bloodbath\".\n\nThe book which the film is based on is vaguely based on real events, but takes significant artistic licence with historical facts. The main story is loosely based on events concerning the light cruiser SMS \"Königsberg\", which was sunk after taking refuge in Rufiji Delta in 1915. Ivory hunter P J Pretorius had gone on board \"Königsberg\" disguised as a native to pace out the ranges for the Navy's guns.\n\nIn the film the German ship is named \"Blücher\"; there was a vessel of this name, but it did not serve in Africa. The film implies that Portugal became a co-belligerent with Britain against Germany when the First World War broke out in August 1914, as the Portuguese supply O'Flynn and Oldsmith with a marked Portuguese plane with a Portuguese pilot to conduct surveillance in German territory. In reality, the Portuguese would not have allowed this as they remained neutral until 1916.\n\nAlthough the motives for killing Fleischer are personal, Sebastian Oldsmith is in fact the only major character who is a citizen of a nation actually at war with Germany.\n\nFilm rights were bought by Michael Klinger, who would also buy the rights to \"Gold Mine\", \"The Sun Bird\", \"The Eye of the Tiger\" and \"Eagle in the Sky\". It was announced in 1969 that the movie version would be made by Cinerama Inc. but it took a number of years for the adaptation to be financed.\n\nIn 1971 Smith wrote to Klinger that, \"It is now becoming critical that somebody start making films out of my books. This is essential for my career - which really needs a good film to take off in the Alistair MacLean class.\"\n\nKlinger was highly enthusiastic about \"Shout at the Devil\" - his son referred to it as his father's equivalent of \"Gone with the Wind\". The producer himself called it a combination between \"The African Queen\" and \"The Guns of Navarone\". However it was an expensive film to produce. Klinger decided to first make a film of Smith's novel \"Gold Mine\".\n\nSmith worked on the script with Stanley Price, who also helped adapt Smith's novel \"Gold Mine\" for Michael Klinger. However, the film ending was changed; in the novel all three main characters die.\n\nThe film's budget has been reported as $9–10 million. Klinger said $3.5 million was provided by AIP.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Malta and - controversially due to the then apartheid regime - in South Africa. Shooting took 15 weeks and began in March 1975. The South African portion of the film was based out of the town of Port St Johns.\n\nStars Roger Moore and Lee Marvin got along well. \"They were very funny and liked each other a great deal,\" said director Peter Hunt. \"They would socialise and get drunk together in the evenings, although they never had thick heads in the morning.\"\n\n\"I love this gentleman,\" said Moore about Marvin. \"Thanks to him I have given my best performance ever. I can only be as good as the other guy. Working with Lee Marvin hauls you up, forces you to try to reach his level.\"\n\nThe movie was cut during post production with around 50 minutes cut out.\n\nThe music was composed by Maurice Jarre.\n\nThe film was one of the most successful British films of 1976 grossing £15 million.\n\nCritic Richard Eder did not like the film much. He wrote, \"The movie has too much plot. All that action, conducted by characters without character—except for Fleischer, whose childlike joy in hurting people is almost appealing—produces lethargy...the movie is a passable midget in absurdly long pants.\"\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert thought that \"\"Shout at the Devil\" is a big, dumb, silly movie that's impossible to dislike. It's so cheerfully corny, so willing to involve its heroes in every possible predicament, that after a while we relax: This is the kind of movie they used to make, back when audiences were supposed to have the mentality of a 12-year-old. It's great to be 12 again.\"\n\nKlinger had the film rights to other Smith novels, \"The Sunbird\", \"Eagle in the Sky\" and \"The Eye of the Tiger\". \"Eagle\" and \"Eye of the Tiger\" were meant to be part of a four picture deal between Klinger and Rank Productions. However none were ever made. The relationship between Smith and Klinger, once warm, ultimately ended in litigation.\n\n"}

{"id": "2153055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153055", "title": "Reg Varney", "text": "Reg Varney\n\nReginald Alfred Varney (11 July 1916 – 16 November 2008) was an English actor, entertainer and comedian best known for his television roles on \"The Rag Trade\" and \"On the Buses\", appearing in the latter's three spin-off film versions.\n\nVarney was born in Canning Town, Essex, to Sidney Thomas Varney and his wife Annie (nee Needham). His father worked in a rubber factory in Silvertown and he was one of five children who grew up in Addington Road, Canning Town. Varney was educated at the nearby Star Lane Primary School in West Ham and after leaving school at 14, he worked as a messenger boy and a page boy at the Regent Palace Hotel. He took piano lessons as a child and was good enough to find employment as a part-time piano player. His first paid engagement was at Plumstead Radical Club in Woolwich, for which he was paid eight shillings and sixpence (42½p). He also played in working men's clubs, pubs and ABC cinemas, and later sang with big bands of the time. He and his mother decided that show business was the career for him, and he gave up his day jobs. Varney made his West End debut in May 1938 as a solo pianist at the Windmill Theatre. In late 1939, he married Lilian E. Flavell (1915-2002) at East Ham.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Varney joined the Royal Engineers, but continued his performing career as an army entertainer, touring in the Far East for a time. After being demobilised in the late 1940s, he starred on stage in a comic revue entitled \"Gaytime\", with Benny Hill as his partner in a double act. He then became an all-round entertainer, working his way around the music halls.\n\nVarney had made only a small number of film and TV appearances prior to being cast in the role of long-suffering factory foreman Reg Turner in the hit BBC television sitcom \"The Rag Trade\" (1961–63), which made him a household name. He was aware that he was the only performer without West End acting experience and worked hard to make up for it. Slightly later, he starred in a show for BBC TV called \"The Valiant Varneys\" (1964–65), performing various characters in front of a live audience. After that followed another comedy role in \"Beggar My Neighbour\" (1966–68); this also starred Pat Coombs, June Whitfield, and Peter Jones. Pat Coombs played the wife of Varney's character. Varney featured in \"The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery\" (1966) with Frankie Howerd, Dora Bryan and George Cole.\n\nThe world's first voucher-based cash dispensing machine was installed at the Enfield Town branch of Barclays Bank. Varney was living in Enfield at the time and for publicity purposes he was photographed making the first withdrawal from the machine on Tuesday 27 June 1967.\n\nVarney's most successful lead role was in the LWT sitcom \"On the Buses\" (1969–73) as bus driver Stan Butler. Varney took considerable lengths to prepare for the role, even attempting to gain a public service vehicle licence so that he could be filmed driving on the open road. However, Varney was not insured so LWT had to employ professional drivers for these scenes. Three spin-off films were made — \"On the Buses\" (1971), \"Mutiny on the Buses\" (1972) and \"Holiday on the Buses\" (1973). Varney was 52 when the first series was recorded, although his character Stan, who lived with his mother and often tried to attract young women, was implied to be aged 35. Varney was only eleven years younger than Doris Hare, the main actress who played Stan's mother.\n\nVarney left the series midway through its last season, hoping to move on to films and other projects. Ultimately, he only appeared in one further non-\"Buses\" film, \"The Best Pair of Legs in the Business\" (1973), and two television series, both made by ATV for the ITV network: an eponymously-titled sketch show (1973-4) and another sitcom, \"Down the Gate\" (1975-6), which was set in Billingsgate Fish Market. However neither series replicated his success with \"On the Buses\", and after \"Down the Gate\" was dropped after twelve episodes, Varney did not star in another television series. LWT revived \"The Rag Trade\" in 1977 but Varney did not reprise his role.\n\nHe later worked as an entertainer on cruise ships and toured Australia with his one-man show. He told an interviewer, \"Whatever I did after \"On the Buses\", nobody wanted to know about it. But I can't knock the programme because it brought me offers to do concert tours in Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\"\n\nAt the height of his fame he was a subject of the television programme \"This Is Your Life\" in May 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, making further appearances in programmes featuring Doris Hare, Douglas Bader, June Whitfield and Anthony Newley.\n\nVarney released several LP albums during his career - \"This Is Reg Varney On The 88s at Abbey Road\" on Columbia in 1972; \"Reg's Party - Reg Varney Plays And Sings\" on EMI-One-Up label in 1973; and \"A Variety of Varney\" on Astor in 1976.\n\nVarney had a heart attack in 1965, and in 1981 he suffered a more serious one. He then contracted a severe viral infection, which for three years made working difficult for him. In 1989 he suffered a stroke, which left him with an uneven heartbeat. Subsequently he divided his time between his home in a small village near Dartmouth and a villa in Malta.\n\nVarney moved to Devon in the late 1980s and lived alone after his wife, Lilian Emma Varney died in East Devon in 2002, aged 87.\n\nIn his retirement years, Varney painted local landscapes in oil, with many to professional standard; some of his works were exhibited in London.\n\nVarney died aged 92 in a nursing home in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, on 16 November 2008, following a chest infection.\n\nIn 2016, 100 years after Varney was born, an exhibition called \"Before the Buses\" was commissioned by his only child, his daughter Jeanne.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the US delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and was elected to Congress from The Bronx.\n\nBingham was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, Hiram Bingham III, was a Senator and explorer and his great grandfather, Hiram Bingham I, was a missionary, who helped translate the Bible into Hawaiian.\n\nBingham attended Hamden Hall Country Day School and Groton School and graduated from Yale University in 1936 with a BA and from Yale Law School in 1939 with a law degree. He was a member of Skull and Bones, class of 1936. In 1940 he was admitted to the bar, and began the practice of law in New York City. His practice was interrupted in August 1941, when he joined the Machinery Branch of the newly created Office of Price Administration (OPA) as a legal advisor. He was not at the OPA for long, for in 1942 he joined the Military Intelligence Service. In April of the following year he was enlisted as a private in the United States Army and was discharged a captain in October 1945 with a War Department citation.\n\nOn his return he was appointed chief of the newly created Alien Enemy Control Section of the State Department. The Alien Enemy Control Section was unpopular and short-lived. Bingham got off the boat before it sank, resuming the practice of law in New York City in 1946.\n\nHe left the practice of law again in 1951 to become assistant director of the Office of International Security Affairs. Bingham left in the same year to become deputy administrator of the Technical Cooperation Administration, implementing the Point 4 Program of technical assistance to developing countries. His book, \"Shirt-Sleeve Diplomacy: Point 4 in Action,\" was published in 1953. He left the administration in that year and resumed the practice of law. In 1955 he became secretary to fellow Bonesman, W. Averell Harriman, while he was Governor of New York. When Harriman was defeated in the 1958 election by Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, Bingham joined the law firm Goldwater & Flynn.\n\nIn 1961 Bingham entered the world of diplomacy, as a United States representative on the United Nations Trusteeship Council with rank of Minister in 1961 and 1962, serving as President in 1962. During this period he was also principal adviser to the U.S. ambassador to U.N. on colonial and trusteeship questions. From 1963 to 1964 he was a United States representative on the United Nations Economic and Social Council with rank of Ambassador. He was also alternate representative to the 15th and 18th United Nations General Assemblies.\n\nIn 1964 he was elected to the House of Representatives from the 23rd District of New York, a district in the Bronx, at a time when elections in the Bronx were decided in the Democratic primaries in contests between \"regular\" or machine Democrats, and \"reform\" or challenger Democrats. Bingham defeated Charles Buckley, the leader of the Bronx \"regular\" Democrats and a powerful, senior committee chairman in Congress, in a rematch following Bingham's defeat in his first try against the incumbent Buckley in the 1962 Democratic primary.\n\nBingham represented the 23rd District from January 3, 1965 until January 3, 1973, when, as a result of redistricting following the 1970 census, he was elected to the House from the 22nd District of New York following a bruising primary with neighboring Democratic incumbent congressman James H. Scheuer. He served the 22nd District from January 3, 1973 until January 3, 1983, but did not pursue reelection when, in 1982, his district essentially disappeared as a result of another post-census redistricting. In the House, Bingham served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. He was particularly dedicated to nuclear non-proliferation and environmental protection. Bingham was instrumental in supporting aid to Romania following the Vrancea earthquake in March 1977, sponsoring a bill to provide $20 million in assistance to the country.\n\nHe was married to June Rossbach (June 20, 1919 – August 21, 2007), an author, playwright, and member of the Lehman family (her great-grandfather was Mayer Lehman, one of the founders of the Lehman Brothers firm). They had four children: Sherrell Bingham Downes; Timothy Woodbridge Bingham; Claudia Bingham Meyers; and June Mitchell (Micki) Esselstyn (d. 1999).\n\nAfter Jonathan Bingham's death, Mrs. Bingham married Robert Birge and was then known as June Bingham Birge.\n\nBingham died from complications of pneumonia, aged 72, at the Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan on July 3, 1986. He was interred in Woodbridge Cemetery, in Salem, New London, Connecticut.\n"}

Owned by the Cherokee Chief James Vann, the Vann House is a Georgia Historic Site on the National Register of Historic Places and one of the oldest remaining structures in the northern third of the state of Georgia. It is located in Murray County, on the outskirts of Chatsworth in northwest Georgia, which has a commanding view of the land around it and of the Cohutta Mountains, about to the east.\n\nWhen James Vann was rising to become the wealthiest businessman and chief in the Cherokee Nation, he decided to build a two-story brick house which would reflect his status. He brought in professional architects for its design. In addition to providing an education to local Cherokees, the Moravians contributed to the building.\n\nIn July 1803, a man named Vogt (perhaps James Vann's brother-in-law Charles Vogt), and Dr. Henry Chandlee Forman, arrived to begin construction. Construction started in late 1803 and completed early in 1804. Both the exterior walls (which are around eighteen inches thick) and the interior walls (about eight inches thick) are solid brick. These bricks came from the red clay located on the Spring Place Plantation (Vann House) property. The handwrought nails and hinges used in construction came from Vann's blacksmith shop. Only the interior walls of the third floor are plaster on wood. \n\nThe lead brick mason of this house, Robert Henry Howell, was born in Virginia and died in 1834. He is buried at the nearby Moravian cemetery in Spring Place, Georgia. He also built the McNair house and the foundation of the Hildebrand house. \n\nThe house is a combination of late Federal-style architecture and early Georgian style. It has two full stories with a third half story: the ceilings of both the first and second floor stand at twelve feet, while the roof of the third floor stands at only six feet.\n\nThe first and second floors have the standard three rooms. On both levels, there is a room to the east, to the west, and a hallway dividing the two. On the first level, the dining room is to the east, while the west room is the drawing-room, more commonly referred to as a family or living room. On the second floor, the east room is the master bedroom, and the west room is the guest bedroom. Only the third floor, which operated as storage space during James's life and then as children's rooms during Joseph's life, strays from this typical design.\n\nClimbing the stairs to the third floor and you can see two rooms. The room the stairway leads into on the third floor is believed to have served as the boys' room. This room is two-thirds the width of the home and has two closets cut into its walls. The second room on the third floor is the girls'. It is only one-third the width of the home; however, this room could be shut off from the boys' room, giving the girls more privacy.\n\nThe Vann House also features a basement with two separate rooms, one of which served as a wine cellar. The other is assumed to have been a chamber for misbehaving slaves, to whom James Vann was known to be exceptionally cruel.\n\nDecorated in red, blue, green, and yellow, the interior of the home is a timeless masterpiece. White is used throughout the house but only as a filler color. There are two possible reasons for these four colors in the home. The first possibility is that these four colors represent different elements of nature. Red represents the Georgia red clay, blue represents the sky, green represents the trees and grass, and yellow represents the wheat and corn of the harvest. The second possibility is that these four colors are part of Federal-style colors.\n\nThese colors are popular in other homes of the late 1700s and early 1800s. The difference between the use of these colors in the Vann House versus other dwellings of the time is color distribution. Most homes of the Federal period would concentrate colors in one room, giving a house a red room, blue room, etc. However, in the Vann House, the colors have been mixed in almost every room, which gives a multi-color appearance. This color scheme is present on the mantels, doorjambs, and wainscottings, all of which are original to the house.\n\nThe house's doors, known as Christian doors, are of particular interest. Their details feature a cross and an open Bible.\n\nIn addition to the blacksmith shop, the grounds contained 42 slave cabins, 6 barns, five smokehouses, a trading post, more than 1,000 peach trees, 147 apple trees, and a still.\n\nAfter constructing the Vann House, James lived in it for five years before his murder at Buffington's Tavern in 1809. After his death, his favorite child, Rich Joe Vann, neither his youngest nor eldest child, inherited the house.\n\nAfter Rich Joe's father died, he made improvements and changes to the new house. After Rich Joe took control of the home, he commissioned and paid for decorating the house between 1809 and 1818.\n\nRich Joe hired a father and son construction crew for this work. In 1818, John McCartney and his son James arrived at the Vann House and began their work. The McCartneys added all of the current woodwork in the house, including ionic columns. They also built the house's most unusual piece of architecture, a floating staircase in the hallway of the third floor. It is said to be \"floating\" or \"hanging,\" because the second landing of the stairs sits over the first-floor hall with no visible supports, with the illusion that the landing is hanging or floating in midair.\n\nThe Vann stairway is one of the oldest examples of cantilevered construction in Georgia. On one side of the main entrance, which initially faced the Federal Road, and works as a set of scales for weight distribution. The staircase, suspended over the first-floor hallway, roughly six inches of the opposite side of the stairway, is in a solid brick wall. The brick wall is far denser than the second landing; this means there will never be enough weight on the landing to \"tip the scale.\"\n\nIn 1819, President James Monroe and his three men were on a trip from Augusta to Nashville. They intended to spend the night in the Spartan Moravian mission at Spring Place. Instead, President Monroe went to a nearby location, The Vann House, which he found more comfortable than the mission, so he asked Rich Joe permission to spend the night. Rich Joe was 20 years old when he met President Monroe. \n\nAfter the Georgia Gold Rush, Rich Joe hired a white man, a Mr. Howel, to run Vann House. Although he never actually worked for Vann, the Cherokee had unknowingly violated a new Georgia law forbidding whites from working for Cherokees without a permit. Leading up to the Cherokee Trail of Tears, Rich Joe and his family were caught amid the struggle between two opposing claims for the house. Colonel William Bishop and the infamous Georgia Guard tried to take over the house on the grounds of his hiring a white man without a permit. Spencer Riley, who claimed to have won the house in the Land Lottery of 1832, known as the Sixth Georgia Land Lottery, claimed the house at the same time. Colonel Bishop then evicted Rich Joe.\n\nColonel Bishop used the house as his local headquarters and permitted his brother, Absalom Bishop, to live there. Riley then took action on his claim and settled in the house. To get rid of Riley, Bishop took a smoldering log and threw it on the cantilevered steps to smoke him out, causing some damage to the house. This action had its intended effect, and Bishop's brother returned to the home.\n\nAlthough Vann and his family lost their home and property, he later sued for the loss and was awarded $19,605 by the government as compensation. Which was nearly double it's the value of $10,000 at the time. The compensation was far from the actual property value.\n\nIn November of that year, Colonel Bishop imprisoned John Howard Payne for 13 days on the grounds of the house. Payne noted as a composer of \"Home, Sweet Home\", had been charged with sedition for supporting the claims of the Cherokee over the state of Georgia.\n\nRich Joe and his family were finally forced out of the house in March 1835 and moved to Webbers Falls, Oklahoma by following the Trail of Tears. They never returned to Georgia or their house.\n\nOver the years, the Vann House has had seventeen different owners. In 1952, J. E. Bradford, a physician who had purchased it in 1920, sold the house to the Georgia Historical Commission and the State of Georgia. In such a severe state of disrepair that the roof had come off, the elements were taking their toll.\n\nOne of the owners had added a room after Rich Joe left Georgia. A restoration project began in 1958. It took six years to complete and included demolishing this additional room that was not present in the original house. Also, repainting the home according to its classic color scheme. Today it is administered by the Parks, Recreation, and Historic Sites division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe State of Georgia, Cherokees, and the State of Oklahoma, as well as other supporters, donated to build a newly designed museum called the \"Robert E. Chambers Interpretive Center\" in 1999, next to the Vann House. It was opened on July 27, 2002, to honor the Cherokee people and their history. The new center also highlights the lives of Chiefs James and Joseph Vann, as well as\nfeaturing the history of the Cherokee Nation over the past 200 years, including the infamous Trail of Tears. Robert E. Chambers was named for supporting the Cherokee, as he was native businessman of Chatsworth.\n\n\n"}

Plaster Stadium\n\nPlaster Stadium (formerly Plaster Sports Complex and Briggs Stadium) is a 17,500-seat football stadium located in Springfield, Missouri. It is home to the Missouri State Bears football team.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1941 as SMS Stadium, a Works Progress Administration project at a cost of only $60,000, before World War II broke out. Its original seating capacity was 8,500. In 1970 it was renamed Briggs Stadium after Arthur Briggs, the school's all-time winningest coach. \n\nIn 1991, the stadium was renamed the Plaster Sports Complex in honor of Robert W. Plaster, chairman of Evergreen Investments of Lebanon, Missouri. Mr. Plaster donated funds for major renovations of the stadium, including expansion of the stadium to its current capacity, including the addition of an upper deck which seats 8,500, 24 luxury suites holding 10 each, a 40-seat luxury box and a new press box. In addition, a new running track and new artificial turf were installed.\n\nThe artificial turf was replaced in 2001 with a FieldTurf surface and in 2006 a new FieldTurf surface was installed. A new scoreboard was added in 2008. It was determined that at the conclusion of the 2013 football season, the aging student (East) bleachers would be torn down. After the student body passed the B.E.A.R. Fee, money was in place to rebuild the student section (East) side. The stadium renovation also included the removal of the track as well as the re-positioning of the field with a new Sport Turf playing surface.\n\nRobert W. Plaster Stadium also includes 12 American handball/racquetball courts, including two courts with spectator seating. The complex also features Health and Fitness, and Athletics Strength and Conditioning centers on the second level of the stadium.\n\nFor many years Plaster Stadium held many of the annual Missouri State High School Activities Association state football championship games. In 1996 all games were moved to the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis, where they remained through 2015. Following the Rams' move back to Los Angeles in January 2016, the MSHSAA voted to return the games to Plaster Field in 2016 and Faurot Field at the University of Missouri in Columbia in 2017.\n\n\n"}

The city remained largely Christian until the Crusades, its bishop maintaining close ties to the Byzantine Empire. After the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by the crusaders, the see was transformed into a Latin archdiocese, subordinate to the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem.\n\nThe diocese was an ancient one, established in one of the first Christian communities ever created: it was due to the work of St Peter and St Paul. Records of the community are dated as far back as the 2nd century. According to the Apostolic Constitutions (7.46), the first \"Bishop of Caesarea\" was Zacchaeus the Publican. Caesarea Maritima was the capital of Roman Iudaea province and after the Bar Kokhba revolt it was the metropolis of the diocese of Palaestina Prima. Until the establishment of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, it was subject to the patriarch of Antioch. The most notable bishop of Caesarea was Eusebius of Caesarea, also known as Eusebius Pamphili. The Library of Caesarea Maritima established by Pamphilus of Caesarea remained in existence until the Arabs invaded Palestine in the 7th century.\n\nThe diocese suffered a troubled history following the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 7th century. The city was raided by the Sassanid Persians in the early 7th century. Following the conquest of the Holy Land by the Islamic armies in the 630s, the diocese and city suffered tremendously and steadily declined in size and importance. It was finally conquered in 640 following a protracted siege.\n\nNonetheless, it remained overwhelmingly Christian, and in the absence of imperial oversight, its independence increased and the archbishop became the effective ruler of the area. \nBy the 9th century there was a substantial colony of Frankish settlers established by Emperor Charlemagne to facilitate Christian pilgrimages. \nHowever, by the 10th century, as periodic Islamic persecution continued and the aura of Byzantine Imperial authority made a resurgence, the diocese fell under the influence of the patriarch of Constantinople for protection and supervision and increasingly fell under Byzantine authority.\n\nSt Pamphilus of Caesarea devoted his life to searching out and obtaining ancient texts which he collected in the Library of Caesarea Maritima that Jerome was later to use, and established a school for theological study. In the scriptorium, a necessary adjunct to all libraries of antiquity, he oversaw the production of accurate edited copies of Scripture. Testimonies to his zeal and care in this work are to be found in the colophons of biblical manuscripts. Jerome's \"\"De Viris Illustribus\"\" (75) says that Pamphilus \"\"transcribed the greater part of the works of Origen of Alexandria with his own hand,\"\" and that \"\"these are still preserved in the library of Cæsarea.\"\" The collections of the library suffered during the persecutions under the Emperor Diocletian, but were repaired subsequently by bishops of Caesarea. It was noted in the 6th century, but Henry Barclay Swete was of the opinion that it probably did not long survive the capture of Caesarea by the Saracens in 638, though a modern historian would attribute more destruction to its previous capture by the Sassanid Persians.\n\nFollowing the schism between Constantinople and Rome in 1054, the community was a Greek Orthodox diocese, with only a marginal Roman Catholic community.\n\nDuring the crusader period, the community became Catholic in 1101. The Frankish community vastly increased in size and a Latin archbishop was established. Under the crusaders, the diocese increased over time to having ten suffragan bishops, including the bishop of Sebastea. During the remainder of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem often served first as archbishop of Caesarea, or of Tyre.\n\nThere was a legend that the Holy Grail had been discovered in Caesarea; the ancient chalice found there in 1101 was later taken to Paris.\n\nSince 1975, Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of Caesarea is Basilios Blatsos, who is also an Exarch of Palaestina Prima, under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The post has narrower responsibilities and authority than the California State Controller. Some of the responsibilities include issuing bonds and notes for the state, and trustee, as well as registrar and paying agent for all general obligation bonds and certain revenue bonds investment of temporarily idle state money. The administration of the state's budgets, financial analyses and planning, money allocation, and economic research is under the California Department of Finance.\n\nThe state treasurer assumes office by way of election. The term of office is a four-year term but is limited to two terms. Elections for the State Treasurer are held on a four-year concurrent basis with the election of the Governor. The current state treasurer is Fiona Ma.\n\n\nThe Office was retained as an elective office in the New Constitution of 1879, in recognition by the Workingman's Party (which factored heavily in the State's constitutional convention) that The Treasurer had a significant impact of local credit guidance under the National Bank system established by the Lincoln Administration. Transcontinental cash settlements were still restricted, so California's local development was driven by a relatively high-proportion of local gold reserve deposits. In 1907, the State Treasurer was instrumental in a massive expansion of credit to rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 Earthquake, however, at that time the Treasurer was essentially an office controlled by the railroads. In 1907, the expansion of California money supply lead by the Treasurer selling bonds to build the Port of San Francisco seawall exposed liquidity problems due to corruption in the New York Clearinghouse, causing the Panic of 1907.\n\nProgressive governor Hiram Johnson left the office essentially untouched. Of the office, he had this to say in his first inaugural:\n\n\"The most advanced thought in our nation has reached the conclusion that we can best avoid blind voting and best obtain the discrimination of the electorate by a short ballot. A very well known editor in our State, during a recent lecture at Stanford University, challenged the faculty of that great institution to produce a single man who had cast an intelligent vote for the office of State Treasurer, and none was produced. Fortunately our State Treasurer is the highest type of citizen and official. The reason the challenge could not be met was that, in the hurry of our existence and in the engrossing importance of the contests for one or two offices, we can not or do not inform ourselves sufficiently regarding the candidates for minor offices... If we can remedy this condition it is our duty to do so, and it is plain that the remedy is by limiting the elective list of offices to those that are naturally conspicuous.\"\n\nThe creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 significantly restricted the power of the State Treasurer to influence local economic development, essentially centralizing National Monetary policy. During the First World War, this was deployed toward War Mobilization. Still, State Bond issuance for major infrastructure projects characterized the office into the 1960's, including bonds for the State Parks System in the 20's, to build facilities for the 1932 Olympic Games, for the Postwar expansion of the University of California and State University Systems, for the State Water Project of 1960, and for the massive expansion of the State Prison System in the 1980s. As California's population and economy expanded, the Local Agency Investment Fund became a significant market player, and the Office developed the capacity to bail out troubled corporations by buying up their bond issuances.\n\nIvy Baker Priest stands out as the first woman to be elected to any California statewide office from 1967-1975, having already served as Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary in the 1950's. She was famous for aphorims, including \"We women don't care too much about getting our pictures on money as long as we can get our hands on it.\" With the election of Kathleen Brown in 1990 as a Democrat, the Democratic-lead legislature significantly expanded the scope and duties of the office; however, the Orange County Bankruptcy also lead the legislature to significantly curtail the permissible investment policies of Treasurer-administered pooled local investments. Although the Treasurer has nominal advisory authority over local debt issuance, the Treasurer was powerless to prevent local government entities such as Stockton or San Bernardino from falling into insolvency.\n"}

{"id": "2153191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153191", "title": "Tone mapping", "text": "Tone mapping\n\nTone mapping is a technique used in image processing and computer graphics to map one set of colors to another to approximate the appearance of high-dynamic-range images in a medium that has a more limited dynamic range. Print-outs, CRT or LCD monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce the full range of light intensities present in natural scenes. Tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene radiance to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content.\n\nThe introduction of film-based photography created issues since capturing the enormous dynamic range of lighting from the real world on a chemically limited negative was very difficult. Early film developers attempted to remedy this issue by designing the film stocks and the print development systems that gave a desired S-shaped tone curve with slightly enhanced contrast (about 15%) in the middle range and gradually compressed highlights and shadows . Photographers have also used dodging and burning to overcome the limitations of the print process .\n\nThe advent of digital photography gave hope for better solutions to this problem. One of the earliest algorithms employed by Land and McCann in 1971 was Retinex, inspired by theories of lightness perception .This method is inspired by the eye’s biological mechanisms of adaptation when lighting conditions are an issue. Gamut mapping algorithms were also extensively studied in the context of color printing. Computational models such as CIECAM02 or iCAM were used to predict color appearance. Despite this, if algorithms could not sufficiently map tones and colors, a skilled artist was still needed, as is the case with cinematographic movie post-processing.\n\nComputer graphic techniques capable of rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance as the main limiting factor of display devices. Several tone mapping operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend image contrast and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale color gamut and dynamic range.\n\nThe goals of tone mapping can be differently stated depending on the particular application. In some cases producing just aesthetically pleasing images is the main goal, while other applications might emphasize reproducing as many image details as possible, or maximizing the image contrast. The goal in realistic rendering applications might be to obtain a perceptual match between a real scene and a displayed image even though the display device is not able to reproduce the full range of luminance values.\n\nVarious tone mapping operators have been developed in the recent years. They all can be divided in two main types:\n\nA simple example of global tone mapping filter is formula_1 where \"V\" is the luminance of the original pixel and \"V\" is the luminance of the filtered pixel. This function will map the luminance \"V\" in the domain formula_2 to a displayable output range of formula_3 While this filter provides a decent contrast for parts of the image with low luminance (particularly when ), parts of the image with higher luminance will get increasingly lower contrast as the luminance of the filtered image goes to 1.\n\nA perhaps more useful global tone mapping method is gamma compression, which has the filter formula_4 where and . This function will map the luminance \"V\" in the domain formula_5 to the output range formula_6 \"γ\" regulates the contrast of the image; a lower value for lower contrast. While a lower constant \"γ\" gives a lower contrast and perhaps also a duller image, it increases the exposure of underexposed parts of the image while at the same time, if , it can decrease the exposure of overexposed parts of the image enough to prevent them from being overexposed.\n\nAn even more sophisticated group of tone mapping algorithms is based on contrast or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated by the fact that the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: gradient domain high dynamic range compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework).\n\nAnother approach to tone mapping of HDR images is inspired by the anchoring theory of lightness perception. This theory explains many characteristics of the human visual system such as lightness constancy and its failures (as in the checker shadow illusion), which are important in the perception of images. The key concept of this tone mapping method (Lightness Perception in Tone Reproduction) is a decomposition of an HDR image into areas (frameworks) of consistent illumination and the local calculation of the lightness values. The net lightness of an image is calculated by merging of the frameworks proportionally to their strength. Particularly important is the anchoring—relating of the luminance to a known luminance, namely estimating which luminance value is perceived as white in the scene. This approach to tone mapping does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance.\n\nOne simple form of tone mapping takes a standard image (not HDR – the dynamic range already compressed) and applies unsharp masking with a large radius, which increases local contrast rather than sharpening. See unsharp masking: local contrast enhancement for details.\n\nOne of the commonly used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 which is based on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping. After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect.\n\nForms of tone mapping long precede digital photography. The manipulation of film and development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, although it is not usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with Ansel Adams, as described in his book \"The Print;\" see also his Zone System.\n\nThe normal process of exposure compensation, brightening shadows and altering contrast applied globally to digital images as part of a professional or serious amateur workflow is also a form of tone mapping.\n\nHowever, HDR tone mapping, usually using \"local operators,\" has become increasingly popular amongst digital photographers as a post-processing technique, where several exposures at different shutter speeds are combined to produce an HDR image and a tone mapping operator is then applied to the result. There are now many examples of locally tone mapped digital images, inaccurately known as \"HDR photographs\", on the internet, and these are of varying quality. This popularity is partly driven by the distinctive appearance of locally tone mapped images, which many people find attractive, and partly by a desire to capture high-contrast scenes that are hard or impossible to photograph in a single exposure, and may not render attractively even when they can be captured. Although digital sensors actually capture a higher dynamic range than film, they completely lose detail in extreme highlights, clipping them to pure white, producing an unattractive result when compared with negative film, which tends to retain colour and some detail in highlights.\n\nIn some cases local tone mapping is used even though the dynamic range of the source image could be captured on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive. In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a single exposure which is then manipulated with conventional processing tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when tone mapping is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, and the amount of shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure.\n\nOne of the original goals of tone mapping was to be able to reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem.\n\nFor this method, models for the Human Visual System (HVS) and the display are first generated, along with a simple tone mapping operator. The contrast distortions are weighted according to their individual visibilities approximated by the HVS. With these models, an objective function that defines the tone curve can be created and solved using a fast quadratic solver.\n\nWith the addition of filters, this method can also be extended to videos. The filters ensure that the rapid changing of the tone-curve between frames are not salient in the final output image.\n\nThe images on the right show the interior of a church, a scene which has a variation in radiance much larger than that which can be displayed on a monitor or recorded by a conventional camera. The six individual exposures from the camera show the radiance of the scene in some range transformed to the range of brightnesses that can be displayed on a monitor. The range of radiances recorded in each photo is limited, so not all details can be displayed at once: for example, details of the dark church interior cannot be displayed at the same time as those of the bright stained-glass window. An algorithm is applied to the six images to recreate the high dynamic range radiance map of the original scene (a high dynamic range image). Alternatively, some higher-end consumer and specialist scientific digital cameras are able to record a high dynamic range image directly, for example with RAW images.\n\nIn the ideal case, a camera might measure luminance directly and store this in the HDR image; however, most high dynamic range images produced by cameras today are not calibrated or even proportional to luminance, due to practical reasons such as cost and time required to measure accurate luminance values — it is often sufficient for artists to use multiple exposures to gain an \"HDR image\" which grossly approximates the true luminance signal.\n\nThe high dynamic range image is passed to a tone mapping operator, in this case a local operator, which transforms the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor. Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce. However, this inaccuracy is perceptually less important than the image detail, which can now be shown in both the window and the church interior simultaneously.\n\nLocal tone mapping produces a number of characteristic effects in images. These include halos around dark objects, a \"painting-like\" or \"cartoon-like\" appearance due to a lack of large global contrasts, and highly saturated colours. Many people find the resulting images attractive and these effects to add an interesting new set of choices for post-processing in digital photography. Some people believe that the results stray too far from realism, or find them unattractive, but these are aesthetic judgements, and often concern the choices made by the photographer during the tone mapping process, rather than being a necessary consequence of using tone mapping.\n\nNot all tone mapped images are visually distinctive. Reducing dynamic range with tone mapping is often useful in bright sunlit scenes, where the difference in intensity between direct illumination and shadow is great. In these cases the global contrast of the scene is reduced, but the local contrast maintained, while the image as a whole continues to look natural. Use of tone mapping in this context may not be apparent from the final image:\nTone mapping can also produce distinctive visual effects in the final image, such as the visible halo around the tower in the Cornell Law School image below. It can be used to produce these effects even when the dynamic range of the original image is not particularly high. Halos in images come about because the local tone mapping operator will brighten areas around dark objects, to maintain the local contrast in the original image, which fools the human visual system into perceiving the dark objects as being dark, even if their actual luminance is the same as that of areas of the image perceived as being bright. Usually this effect is subtle, but if the contrasts in the original image are extreme, or the photographer deliberately sets the luminance gradient to be very steep, the halos become visible.\n\n\n\n"}

Because of its Homeric content, \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\" has recently attracted the attention of a group of scholars at Bologna University in Italy. Mrs. Eleonora Cavallini, Professor in Classics, has written about this song:\n\n\"Joey DeMaio’s lyrics imply a careful and scrupulous reading of the \"Iliad\". The songwriter has focused his attention essentially on the crucial fight between Hector and Achilles, has paraphrased some passages of the poem adapting them to the melodic structure with a certain fluency and partly reinterpreting them, but never altering or upsetting Homer’s storyline. The purpose of the lyrics (and of the music as well) is to evoke some characteristic Homeric sceneries: the raging storm of the battle, the barbaric, ferocious exultance of the winner, the grief and anguish of the warrior who feels death impending over him. The whole action hinges upon Hector and Achilles, who are represented as specular characters, divided by an irreducible hatred and yet destined to share a similar destiny. Both are caught in the moment of the greatest exaltation, as they savagely rejoice for the blood of their killed enemies, but also in the one of the extreme pain, when the daemon of war finally pounces on them. Furthermore, differently than in the irreverent and iconoclastic movie \"Troy\", in \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\", the divine is a constant and ineluctable presence, determining human destinies with inscrutable and steely will, and, despite the generic reference to 'the gods', the real master of human lives is Zeus, the only God to whom both Hector and Achilles address their prayers\"\n\nAll songs written by Joey DeMaio except where noted.\n\n"}

{"id": "2153225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153225", "title": "Chushi Gangdruk", "text": "Chushi Gangdruk\n\nChushi Gangdruk (, literally \"Four Rivers, Six Ranges\", full name: , \"the Kham Four Rivers, Six Ranges Tibetan Defenders of the Faith Volunteer Army\") was an organization of Tibetan guerrilla fighters, formally created on June 16, 1958, which had been fighting the forces of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tibet since 1956. \n\nThe Dokham Chushi Gangdruk organization, a charity set up in New York City and India with chapters in other countries, now supports survivors of the Chushi Gangdruk resistance currently living in India. Chushi Gangdruk also led The 14th Dalai Lama out of Lhasa, where he had lived, soon after the start of the Chinese invasion. During that time, a group of Chushi Gangdruk guerillas was led by Kunga Samten, who is now deceased. Because the United States was prepared to recognize People's Republic of China in the early 1970s, CIA Tibetan Program, which funded the Chushi Gangdruk army, was ended in 1974.\n\nChushi Gangdruk \"Four Rivers, Six Ranges\" is the name traditionally given to the eastern Tibetan region of Kham where the gorges of the Gyalmo Nyulchu (Salween), Dzachu (Mekong), Drichu (Yangtse), and Machu (Huang Ho) rivers, all arising on the Tibetan Plateau, pass between six parallel ranges of mountains (Duldza Zalmogang, Tshawagang, Markhamgang, Pobargang, Mardzagang, and Minyagang) that form the watersheds for these rivers. \"Chu\" (choo) is the Tibetan word for \"water\", and \"shi\" (she) is the Tibetan word for 4. \"Gang\" is range, and \"druk\" (drewk) means 6.\n\nOn 19 October 1950, the monastery where Ngabo Shapé was hiding was surrounded by the Chinese troops accompanied by a few Khampa guides, and here Ngabo Shapé and his officials and troops surrendered to the invading Chinese. The Tibetan Government army in Chamdo was defeated, and the Communist Chinese army took over the city of Chamdo. In Drugu monastery, Ngabo Shapé signed the official surrender.\n\nDuring the negotiation of the Seventeen-Point Agreement, when the negotiation broke down after Ngabo Shapé resisted to sign the agreement, Li Weihan threatened to order the Chinese troops to march into Lhasa. They decided it was more perilous to Tibet not to reach an agreement, therefore, they accepted the Chinese terms without asking Lhasa. The Chinese were further furious when they were told that the Dalai Lama’s seal was still in Yatung with him. The Chinese made new seal for Ngabo Shapé to stamp the document when he exclaimed that he did not have his official seal to stamp the document, though he had with him the official seal as the Governor General of Kham. Therefore, on 23 May 1951, Ngabo Shapé was forced to sign under duress the “Agreement of the Central People’s Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,” commonly known as the “Seventeen-Point Agreement”.\n\nAndrug Gompo Tashi (also known as Andrug Jindak) established a people's army called Chushi Gangdrug. Like many other volunteered fighters, Andrug Jindak financed many of the freedom fighters and was accepted as their undisputed leader of the resistance army.\n\nIn order to mobilize more support across the different regions of Tibet, the names Tenshung Danglang Mak were appended to Chushi Gangdrug in order to address the pan-Tibetan composition of the people's army. It was not a Tibetan government army but rather a grassroots army of the Tibetan people. Tenshung Danglang Mak fought for the political and religious freedom of Tibet. Khampas and Amdowas had been fighting against the invading Chinese Communist troops since 1956 in different parts of Kham and Amdo. On 16 June 1958, a meeting of Chushi Gangdrug and their supporters was held in Lhodak Dhama Dzong with impressive cavalry parade, incense burnt to the Dalai Lama photograph, and then launched the Chushi Gangdrug yellow flag of the Tensik Danglang Mak with an emblem of two swords represented a deity and handles symbolic of Dorjee or thunderbolt and lotus flower.\n\nThe formation of the Chushi Gangdruk Volunteer Force was announced on June 16, 1958. It was called National Volunteer Defence Army (NVDA). \"Chushi Gangdruk\" is a Tibetan phrase meaning \"land of four rivers and six ranges,\" and refers to Amdo and Kham. The group included Tibetans from those regions of eastern Tibet, and its main objective was to drive PRC occupational forces out of Tibet. While central and western Tibet (Ü-Tsang) were bound by a 17-point agreement with the People's Republic of China, the PRC initiated land reform in eastern Tibet (including Amdo and Kham) and engaged in harsh reprisals against the Tibetan land-owners there. \nUnder the direction of General Andrug Gonpo Tashi, Chushi Gangdruk included 37 allied forces and 18 military commanders. They drafted a 27-point military law governing the conduct of the volunteers. Their headquarters were located at Tsona, then later moved to Lhagyari. \n\nInitially militia members purchased their own weapons, mainly World War II-era British .303 in, German 7.92 mm, and Russian 7.62 mm caliber rifles. Chushi Gangdruk contacted the US government for support. However, the State Department required an official request from the Tibetan government in Lhasa, which was not forthcoming. State Department requests were made and ignored in both 1957 and 1958.\n\nWithout getting approval from the Dalai Lama, the US Central Intelligence Agency decided to go ahead to support the Chushi Gangdrug Tenshung Danglang Mak in the summer of 1959. The CIA provided the group with material assistance and aid, including arms and ammunition, as well as training to members of Chushi Gangdruk and other Tibetan guerrilla groups at Camp Hale. \n\nThe Tibetan involvement with the U.S. came during the Cold War and decolonization period in world history that in the United States manifested as anticommunism, and in the People’s Republic of China as anticapitalism. \n\nAllen Dulles, the CIA deputy director responsible for overseeing all CIA covert operations, saw an opportunity to destabilize Communist China. The primary motive was more to impede and harass the Chinese Communists, than to render sufficient aid to the Tibetans.\n\nChushi Gangdrug assisted the escape of the 14th Dalai Lama to India in March 1959. After this, the idea of any further battle with the Chinese Communist troops was abandoned. Andrug Jindak persuaded Kunga Samten Dewatshang in Tawang to surrender his weapons to the Indian authorities. Shangri Lhagyal and other Chushi Gangdrug fighters handed over their weapons to the Indian officials at Tezpur, India. They crossed the border where they were greeted by a representative of the Tibetan Government, Tsedrung Jampa Wangdu. On 29 April 1959, they handed over their rifles, ammunition, and all other weapons to the Deputy Commissioner of Tezpur district, and were permitted to take their gold, silver, and other valuables.\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama conferred the rank of Dsasak to Andrug Gompo Tashi in a letter: “You have led the Chushi Gangdrug force with unshakeable determination to resist the Chinese occupation army for the great national cause of defending the freedom of Tibet. I confer on you the rank of Dzasak (the highest military rank equivalent to general) in recognition of your services to the country. The present situation calls for a continuance of your brave struggle with the same determination and courage.” In addition, Andrug Jindak received some gifts of priceless religious relics including an earthen statue of God of Protection Jigchi Mahai and some holy beads.\n\nFrom 1960, Chushi Gangdruk conducted its guerrilla operations from the northern Nepalese region of Mustang. In 1974, guerrilla operations ceased after the CIA, given the realignment of Sino-American relations initiated by President Richard Nixon, terminated its program of assistance to the Tibetan resistance movement and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual and temporal leader, taped a message telling the Tibetans to lay down their weapons and surrender peacefully.\n\n\n"}

These characters allow any polynomial, chemical and certain other equations to be represented in plain text without using any form of markup like HTML or TeX.\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium and the Unicode Consortium have made recommendations on the choice between using markup and using superscript and subscript characters: \"When used in mathematical context (MathML) it is recommended to consistently use style markup for superscripts and subscripts... However, when super and sub-scripts are to reflect semantic distinctions, it is easier to work with these meanings encoded in text rather than markup, for example, in phonetic or phonemic transcription.\"\n\nThe \"intended\" use when these characters were added to Unicode was to allow chemical and algebra formulas and phonetics to be written without markup, but produce true superscripts and subscripts. Thus \"H₂O\" (using a subscript character) is \"supposed\" to be identical to \"HO\" (with subscript markup).\n\nIn reality most fonts that include these characters ignore the Unicode definition, and design the digits for mathematical numerator and denominator glyphs, which are smaller than normal characters but are aligned with the cap line and the baseline, respectively. When used with the solidus, these glyphs are useful for making arbitrary diagonal fractions (similar to the ½ glyph). Trying to make fractions using existing software super/subscripts look messier (example: /), so font designers provided this alternative. This also makes the superscript letters useful for ordinal indicators, more closely matching the ª and º characters. However it makes them incorrect for normal super and subscripts, and generally formulas look better using markup than these characters.\n\nUnicode intended to produce diagonal fractions through a different mechanism but it is very poorly supported. The fraction slash U+2044 is visually similar to the solidus, but when used with the ordinary digits (not the superscripts and subscripts) is intended to tell a layout system that a fraction such as ¾ should be rendered using automatic glyph substitution for the digits. Some browsers support this but not in all fonts, a selection of fonts is shown in the below table.\n\nThe most common superscript digits (1, 2, and 3) were in ISO-8859-1 and were therefore carried over into those positions in the Latin-1 range of Unicode. The rest were placed in a dedicated section of Unicode at to U+209F. The two tables below show these characters. Each superscript or subscript character is preceded by a normal \"x\" to show the subscripting/superscripting. The table on the left contains the actual Unicode characters; the one on the right contains the equivalents using HTML markup for the subscript or superscript.\n\nUnicode version 13.0 also includes subscript and superscript characters that are intended for semantic usage, in the following blocks:\n\nConsolidated, the Unicode standard contains superscript and subscript versions of a subset of Latin and Greek letters. Here they are arranged in order for comparison (or for copy and paste convenience). Since these characters come from different ranges, they may not be of the same size and position due to font substitution. Asterisks mark small capitals that are not distinct from minuscules and so would not be expected to be supported by Unicode. \n\nSee also small caps in Unicode, superscript IPA letters.\n\nPrimarily for compatibility with earlier character sets, Unicode contains a number of characters that compose super- and subscripts with other symbols. In most fonts these render much better than attempts to construct these symbols from the above characters or by using markup.\n\n"}
{"id": "2153245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153245", "title": "Albert Warner", "text": "Albert Warner\n\nAbraham \"Albert\" Warner (born Aaron Wonsal, July 23, 1884 – November 26, 1967) was an American film executive who was one of the founders of Warner Bros. He established the production studio with his brothers Harry, Sam, and Jack L. Warner. He served as the studio's treasurer, until he sold his stock in 1956.\n\nAbraham \"Wonsal\" or \"Wonskolaser\", later Abraham Warner, was born in the village Krasnosielc, Congress Poland, Russian Empire (now part of Poland). He was the son of Benjamin \"Wonsal\" or \"Wonskolaser,\" a shoemaker born in Krasnosielc, and Pearl Leah Eichelbaum, both Polish Jews. He came to Baltimore, Maryland with his mother and siblings in October 1889 on the steamship \"Hermann\" from Bremen, Germany. Their father had preceded them, immigrating to Baltimore in 1888 and following his trade in shoes and shoe repair. He changed the family name to Warner, which was used thereafter. As in many Jewish immigrant families, some of the children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names. Abraham and Jacob were late among the children to do so, becoming \"Albert\" and \"Jack\" after they came of age. However, his nickname was \"Abe.\"\n\nIn Baltimore, the money Benjamin Warner earned in the shoe repair business was not enough to provide for his growing household. He and Pearl had another daughter, Fannie, not long after they arrived. Benjamin moved the family to Canada, inspired by a friend's advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs. Sons Jacob and David Warner were born in London, Ontario. After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family. Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there. In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town. Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city's downtown area. \nIn the late 1890s, Albert became fascinated by the bicycle craze that swept through the USA. and his older brother Harry opened a bicycle shop in Youngstown together as well. The two also tried to open a bowling alley together, but were unsuccessful.\n\nAlbert Warner stayed in school longer than any his three brothers. In 1900, Warner entered Youngstown's Rayen High School, where he served as quarterback for the school's football team. Warner eventually dropped out, and eventually got a job in Chicago as a salesman for the soap company Swift and Company. Warner's life would soon pursue a new direction after brother Sam was able to purchase Kinetoscope in 1903.\n\nAs a young man, along with his brother Sam, Albert Warner entered the nickelodeon business, and started displaying copies of \"The Great Train Robbery\" from a Kinetoscope at carnivals in Ohio and Pennsylvania in 1903; Sam ran the projector and Albert sold tickets. In 1905, Harry agreed to join his two brothers' business and sold his Youngstown bicycle shop. During this time, the three brothers purchased a building in New Castle, Pennsylvania; with their new building, the brothers established their first theater, The Cascade Movie Palace. The theater was so successful that the brothers were able to purchase a second theater in New Castle as well. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. In 1907, the three brothers acquired fifteen additional theaters in the state of Pennsylvania, and named their new business The Dusquesne Amusement Supply Company. The three brothers then rented an office in the Bakewell building in downtown Pittsburgh with a loan from Max Fleischer. Harry then sent Sam to New York to purchase and ship films for their Pittsburgh exchange company, while he and Albert remained in Pittsburgh to run the business.\n\nIn 1909, the brothers sold the Cascade Theater to open a second film exchange company in Norfolk, Virginia; through this second film exchange, younger brother Jack joined his three brothers' business. Afterwards, Sam and Jack went to Norfolk, while Harry and Albert stayed in Pittsburgh. However, one serious threat to the Warners film company was the advent of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees. In 1910, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company, for \"$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000\". After selling their business, the brothers found work distributing films for Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company in Pittsburgh. In 1912, Sam Warner would help the brothers earn a $1,500 profit by distributing the Italian film \"Dante's Inferno\" in the United States. Harry Warner, encouraged by the success of \"Dante's Inferno\" and wary of Edison's growing monopoly, decided to leave Laemmle and establish an independent film production company for himself and his three brothers, Warner Features; Albert and Harry opened an office in New York, while Sam was sent to operate the company's new Los Angeles film exchange division, and Jack was sent to run the company's new San Francisco film exchange division. In 1918, thanks in part to a loan from Ambassador James W. Gerald, the brothers expanded operations and established a studio near Hollywood, California Sam and Jack moved to the West Coast to produce films while Albert and Harry remained on the East Coast to handle distribution.\n\nBetween the years 1919 and 1920, the studio was not able to garnish any profits. During this time, banker Motley Flint helped the Warners pay off their debts. Shortly afterwards, the four brothers then decided to relocate their studio from Culver City to Sunset Boulevard. The studio rebounded in 1921, after the success of the studio's film \"Why Girls Leave Home\". As a result of the financial success of the film, its director, Harry Rapf, was appointed the studio's new head producer. On April 4, 1923, following the studio's successful film \"The Gold Diggers\", Warner Brothers, Inc. was officially established. Albert remained in New York, where he ran the company's distribution and finances.\n\nWarner Bros' first film, \"Where the North Begins\", drew success for the brothers not seen since \"My Four Years in Germany\". The film also made the dog Rin Tin Tin the studio's first star. Newcomer director Darryl Zanuck's career was also greatly boosted because of his productions of Rin Tin Tin as well. Zanuck would eventually become a top producer for the studio as well, and between 1928 and 1933, served as Jack Warner's right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films.\n\nAfter establishing Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio had overdrawn $1,000,000 (the amount which Warner had loaned from Flint). At this, Albert convinced Harry not to purchase the screenrights to the hit play \"Rain\". Harry then decided to help ease the company's financial status by acquiring forty theaters in the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nMore success would also come for the studio after the brothers hired German director Ernst Lubitsch as head director; Rapf had departed the studio and accepted an offer to work at MGM. Lubitsch's first film at the studio, \"The Marriage Circle\", became the studio's most successful film of 1924, and was also on the New York Times best list for the year. The studio's 1924 film \"Beau Brummel\" also made John Barrymore a top star at the studio. Despite the success the brothers now had, they still could not compete with the \"big three\" studios (First National, Paramount, and MGM)\n\nIn 1925, Albert's older brother Harry and a large group of independent film-makers assembled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to challenge the monopoly the big three had over the film industry. Harry and the other independent film-makers at the Milwaukee convention agreed to spend $500,000 in newspaper advertisements; this action would help benefit Warner Bros. profits. With help from a loan supplied by Goldman, Sachs head banker Waddill Catchings, Warner would find a way to successfully respond to the growing concern the big three studios further induced to Warner Bros., and expanded the company's operations by purchasing the Brooklyn theater company Vitagraph. Through this purchase, the Warners now had theaters in the New York area.\n\nIn 1925, Sam Warner had also acquired a radio station, KWBC. After acquiring this radio station, Sam decided to make an attempt to use synchronized sound in future Warner Bros. pictures. However, Sam Warner had initial reservations about the idea, in which he is quoted as saying \"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\" when his brother, CEO Harry Warner proposed the idea to him. Under Warner and his brothers leadership, the company came to own and operate some 250 theaters in which to screen its films, and was a successful pioneer of the sound film industry and the company still thrives today. However, by February 1926 the brothers' radio business had failed, and the studio suffered a net loss of $333,413.\n\nAfter a period of refusing to accept the usage of sound in the company's films, Harry Warner now agreed to use synchronized sound in Warner Bros. shorts, as long as it just for usage of background music, Harry then made a visit to Western Electric's Bell Laboratories in New York, (which younger brother Sam had earlier visited) and was impressed. One problem that occurred for the Warners was the fact that the high-ups at Western Electric were anti-Semitic. Sam was able to convince the high-ups to sign with the studio after his wife Lina wore a gold cross at a dinner he attended with Western Electric. Afterwards, Harry signed a partnership agreement with Western Electric to use Bell Laboratories to test the sound-on-film process. \nAfter the agreement was signed, Vitaphone was established, and Sam and Jack decided to take a big step forward make Don Juan. The film began with eight Vitaphone features filmed in sound. Despite the success it had at the box office, the film was not able to match its expensive budget. Harry was now further convinced not to use any more sound in Warner Bros. pictures. \nWith Harry now refusing to allow further Vitaphone productions, Paramount head Adolph Zukor took advantage of the situation and tried to offer Sam a deal as an executive producer for his studio if he brought Vitaphone with him. Sam easily accepted Zukor's offer, but the offer died after Paramount lost money in the wake of Rudolph Valentino's death in late 1926. By April 1927, the Big Five studios (First National, Paramount, MGM, Universal, and Producers Distributing) had put the Warners in financial ruin, and Western Electric renewed the Warner's Vitaphone contract with terms that it was no longer exclusive and that other film company's could test sound with Western Electric as well; the Warners were even forced to sell some of their stock to Harry Cohn, the head of the independent film company Columbia Pictures. Eventually, Harry agreed to accept Sam's demands to continue with Vitaphone productions, and the studio soon began production of the first talkie, \"The Jazz Singer\"; soon after its release, \"The Jazz Singer\" would indeed help establish the Warners as, arguably, the three most important figures in the film industry. On October 5, 1927 Sam would die and younger brother Jack was granted with the power to head all of the studio's production, despite the fact that Jack still did not have as much power over the studio as Harry did, as he was only the studio's vice president.\n\nWith the success of the \"Jazz Singer\", more talkies followed. With the large sums of money the Warners now had on-hand, Harry was able to expand business operations further. Harry Warner was able to acquire the Stanley Corporation for the studio, This purchase gave them a share in rival First National Pictures, of which Stanley owned one-third. After this purchase, Warner was soon able to acquire William Fox's one third remaining share in First National and was now officially the majority stockholder of the company. Harry, after purchasing a string of music publishers, was even able to establish a music subsidiary-Warner Bros. Music- and buy out additional radio companies, foreign sound patents, and a lithograph company as well; In 1929, with the large amount of money he now had made off of the studio's valuable subsidiaries, Albert acquired a large home in Rye, Westchester County, New York, which he dubbed \"Caradel Hall.\"\n\nWith the Wall Street Crash of 1929 officially marking the beginning of The Great Depression, Albert saw that the studio was in need of additional star power in order to survive. Following Albert's advice, Jack and Harry Warner acquired three Paramount stars (William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton) for studio salaries doubled from their previous ones. This move proved to be a success, and stockholders maintained confident in the Warners. In late 1929, Jack Warner would hire sixty-one-year-old actor George Arliss to star in the studio's film \"Disraeli\". To everybody's surprise, the film \"Disraeli\" was a success, and Arliss would win an Oscar for Best Actor for his role in the film and star in nine more films with the studio as well.\n\nWith the collapse of the market for musicals, Warner Bros., under production head Darryl F. Zanuck, turned to more realistic and gritty storylines, 'torn from the headlines' pictures that some said glorified gangsters; Warner Bros. soon became known as \"gangster studio. The studio's first gangster film Little Caesar was a great success at the box office. And Edward Robinson was cast a star in many of the wave of gangster films the studio produced after Little Caesar. The studio's next gangster film, \"The Public Enemy\", would also make James Cagney arguably the studio's new top star, and the Warners were now further convinced to make more gangster films as well. \nAnother gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed \"I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang\", starring Paul Muni. In addition to Cagney and Robinson, Paul Muni was also given a big push as one the studio's top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang. The film got audiences in the United States to question the legal system in the United States. and by January 1933, the film's protagonist Robert Elliott Burns - who was still imprisoned in New Jersey - and a number of different chain gang prisoners nationwide in the United States were able to appeal and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J Harold Hardy - who was also made into a character in the film - sued the studio for displaying \"vicious, brutual and false attacks\" against him in the film. After appearing in the film \"The Man Who Played God\", Bette Davis would also become a top star for the studio as well. In 1933, the studio's very successful film 42nd Street would revive the studio's musicals Most these new musicals featured Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell as the stars, and were mostly directed by Busby Berkeley. \nBy 1931, however, the studio would begin to feel the effects of the Depression as the general public became unable to afford the price for movie tickets. In 1931, the studio would reportedly suffer a net loss of $8,000,000.00. The following year, the studio would suffer an additional $14,000,000.00 net loss as well. \nIn 1933, relief for the studio came after Franklin Roosevelt became US president in 1933 and US economy rebounded due to the New Deal; because of this economic rebound, box office profits for Warner Bros. existed once again. However, this same year, the studio's long time head producer Darryl F. Zanuck quit, because: 1) Harry Warner's relationship with Zanuck became strained after Harry was strongly against allowing Zanuck film \"Baby Face\" to step outside the Hays Code boundaries; and 2) the studio reduced Zanuck's salary as a result of the financial woes the Great Depression gave the studio's net profits, and Harry still refused to raise his salary in the wake of the New Deal's rebound. Zanuck produced his letter of resignation to Jack Warner, and went on to establish his own company. In the wake of Zanuck's resignation, Harry Warner agreed to again raise the salary for the studio's employees.\n\nIn 1933, the studio was also able to bring newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan films into the Warner Bros. fold. Hearst had previously been signed with MGM, but he ended his ties with the company after a dispute with the company's head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Marion Davies; Davies was a longtime mistress of Hearst, and was now struggling to draw box office success. Through the studios partnership with Hearst, Harry's younger brother Jack was also able to sign Davies to a studio contract as well. Hearst's company and Davies' films, however, could not increase the studio's net profits. In 1934, Warner officially purchased the Teddington Studio as well.\n\nIn 1934, the studio would suffer a net loss of over $2,500,000.00. $500,000 of this loss was also the result of physical damage to the Warner Bros. Burbank studio that occurred after a massive fire that broke out in the studio around the end of 1934, and destroyed twenty years worth of early Warner Bros. films. The following year, Hearst's film adaption of William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" would fail at the box office and the studio net loss increased. During the year 1935, the studio's revived musicals would also suffer a major blow after director Busby Berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk one night. By the end of the 1935, however, relief would come for the Warners, as the studio would rebound with a year-end net profit of $674,158.00.\n\nOn November 25, 1947, Albert Warner and other executives in the motion picture industry issued the Waldorf Statement, first promulgating the Hollywood Blacklist. Around this time, Albert also bought a second mansion in Miami Beach, Florida, where he lived for most of the remaining years of his life. By 1956, the studio was losing money and Albert wanted to retire and live full-time in his Miami Beach house.\n\nIn May 1956, the brothers announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate headed by Boston banker Serge Semenenko that purchased 90% (800,000 shares) of the company's stock. After the three brothers sold their stock, in an under-the-table deal with Semenenko, Jack officially joined Semenenko's syndicate and bought back all his stock, which consisted of 200,000 shares. The deal officially completed in July. Now the company's largest stockholder, Jack appointed himself as the new company president. By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother's subterfuge, it was too late.\n\nAlbert read about Jack's dealings while spending time in New York City. He never spoke to Jack again, but he did later rejoin the company's board of directors to stop Jack \"from stealing the stockholders blind\".\n\nAlbert Warner died of a stroke in 1967 in Miami Beach. A funeral service was held in Los Angeles. Warner was then interred in Brooklyn, next to his first wife Bessie Krieger. After Albert's second wife Bessie Warner died in 1970 she was interred with him as well in Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1908, Warner married Bessie Krieger, in New Castle, Pennsylvania. Krieger died in 1923 from influenza. On April 23, 1925, Warner married Bessie Siegal, the widow of his friend, Jonas Siegal. The couple remained married until Warner's death in 1967. Through his marriage to Bessie Siegel, Warner had a stepson, Arthur Jack Steel, who married Ruth Mandel, and had sons John and Lewis Steel (named after Harry Warner's son Lewis Warner). Warner was noted to never adapt the upper class lifestyle, remaining unrefined throughout his life.\n\nLike his brother Harry, Albert too would be a fan of Thoroughbred racing and beginning in the 1930s owned horses he raced under the name Warbern Stable and later under the \"nom de course\", Warner Stable. Albert Warner became involved in Thoroughbred acing during the 1930s In March 1945, Warner purchased Elberton Hill Farm in Harford County, Maryland from G. Ray Bryson and his wife, Ella K. Bryson. The property was used for his East Coast racing operations under the management of trainer A. G. \"Bob\" Robertson.\n\nAmong Warner's best horses, Native Charger won the 1965 Flamingo Stakes and the Florida Derby that sent him on the road to the Kentucky Derby in which he finished fourth to winner Lucky Debonair.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2153254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153254", "title": "Liesing", "text": "Liesing\n\nLiesing () is the 23rd district of Vienna. It is on the southwest edge of Vienna, Austria.\n\nIt was formed after Austria's \"Anschluss\" with Germany, when Vienna expanded from 21 districts to 26. Fifteen Lower Austrian districts, especially the old legal jurisdiction of \"Liesing\", were incorporated into the 25th district.\n\nAfter the allied occupation of Vienna, this law was not recognized and Liesing became a part of Lower Austria in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946, a law intended to alter the districts of Vienna was vetoed by the occupation authorities. In 1954 the objection was withdrawn. Liesing was one of only two districts that remained in Vienna in the new organization. The areas Breitenfurt bei Wien, Laab im Walde, Purkersdorf, Perchtoldsdorf, Vösendorf, and Kaltenleutgeben returned to Lower Austria. Since 1954, the 23rd district has been composed of the following former districts:\nLiesing lies in the southwest of Vienna and borders Lower Austria along with the districts Favoriten, Meidling, und Hietzing. The district lies along both sides of the Liesing brook and extends from the Wienerwald into the Viennese basin. With 7.7% of the total area, Liesing is the fifth largest district of Vienna and a third is natural areas. Areas in the district were threatened by flooding for a long time.\n\nLiesing contains three geological regions including parts of the Wienerwald Woods and the Viennese Basin. The steep slopes and bare rocks of the Northern Chalk Alps (\"Kalksteinwienerwald\") are found in the southwest of the district and stretch north as far as the Dorother Wald and, in the east, reach as far as Antonshöhe hill. The chalk zone in Liesing is divided into two sections. The Anhöhe of the Leopoldsdorfer Wald consists of Hauptdolomit, a type of rock formation that stretches in the direction of Kalksburg as far as the Himmelwiese. North of the dolomite zone, there is a wide band of Kieselkalk chalk. In the chalk region can be found the Antonshöhe, where radiolarit for flint cutting edges was mined in the Late Stone Age. North of the Kaltenleutgebner Straße along the edge of the valley can be found quarries delivering chalk, mergel, sandstone etc. for the building industry. To the north, are the soft hills of the Flyschzone (Sandstone Vienna Woods). During the formation of the alps, several layers of stone, sandstone, mergel and chalkmergel were deformed. The Laab und Kahlenberg \"Decke\" are relics of a sea that stretched from the edge of the alps to the Carpathian mountains during the Cretaceous Period and early Tertiary Period. At the final stage of the formation of the alps during the Miocene, the sea floor sank, leading to the formation of the Viennese Basin. Today this area lies mainly east of the edge of the woods. Gravel, sand and sandstone dominate this park of the district. In Atzgersdorf, the \"\"Atzgersdorfer Kalkstein\"\" was quarried for centuries, out of which Sarmatium was produced. In the Liesing area, deposits of tegel were formed during the Miocene and Pliocene.[2]\n\nThe highest elevations are found in the western part of the district, the Eichkogel at at the southwestern edge marking the highest point in the district. North of the Reichen Liesing, the Wilder Berg and the Antonshöhe are the highest points. To the east, the hills get progressively lower. While Kroissberg, at , Kadoltsberg and Neuberg hill represent the last areas of the previously extensive wine-producing area, the Wotrubakirche church is located on the Sankt-Georgen-Berg in between. To the north, Liesing borders on the Rosenhügel (in Hietzing) and the Wienerberg hill (in Favoriten).\n\nThe most important water course in Liesing has always been the Liesingbach. The \"Reiche Liesing\" flows from the west through Kalksburg, where it is joined by Gütenbach, which drains part of the Lainzer Tiergarten. Below Kalksburg, the Kalksburger Graben joins the Reiche Liesing underground, before it joins the \"Dürre Liesing\" to form the \"Liesing\". The canalization of the Liesing has been recently partially restored to a natural form. In the northern part of the district, the ponds, alte Ziegelteiche, Figurenteich and Steinsee (the latter not accessible to the public) can all be found along the Liesing. South of Siebenhirten, is the Schellensee lake which is also closed to the public.\n\nLiesing was formed from eight previously independent communities. In the east is Inzersdorf, where the large industrially and commercially used areas as well as the fruit and vegetable market are found. This was also previously the location of the Inzersdorfer company named after the district. To the west of Inzersdorf is Erlaa, which today is best known for the large residential apartment complex (Wohnpark Alt-Erlaa) located north of the old centre of the village. The adjacent Siebenhirten, to the south, is also mainly residential and is connected to the U-Bahn on the U6 line by the terminal station of the same name. The Liesing industrial park is also part of Siebenhirten. West of Siebenhirten is the area of Liesing which lends its name to the whole district. In addition to the old centre with its town hall (Bezirksamt) and bus & rail connecting point, the eastern part of Liesing is also used for commercial purposes. North of Liesing is Atzgersdorf, with a mixture of low-density housing and commercial areas along the railway line, with little access to green areas. In the northwest of the district, is the village of Mauer, with low-density housing and the largest share of the Vienna Woods. South of Mauer are Rodaun and Kalksburg, both of which are extensively green and retain largely intact village structures.\n\nIn 1954, Liesing was incorporated as the 23rd District, combining 8 former district municipalities:\nAtzgersdorf, Erlaa,\nInzersdorf, Kalksburg,\nLiesing,\nMauer,\nRodaun and Siebenhirten.\n\nEven before the creation of the district, municipality existed between the old towns of the territory, with various political groupings in the administration. Since the Middle Ages, connections had been noted. Kadolt the Elder from around Eckartsau, in the 14th century, had formed a certain political unity with the places Erlaa, Kalksburg, Mauer and Rodaun.\nAlso the parish Atzgersdorf played a role, up to the Josephine reforms, as a regional religious centre of power for surrounding villages. From there, the Catholic residents of Altmannsdorf, Erlaa, Hetzendorf, Liesing, Mauer, Siebenhirten and partly Kalksburg, while having their own church buildings, did not have their own parishes.\n\nThe SPÖ has always been the strongest party in Liesing.\nAt the first free votes after world war two the SPÖ reached 55.3%\nand the absolute majority the ÖVP 31.7% and the KPÖ remarkable 13%.\nIn 1946 Hans Radfux from the Socialdemocrats followed the former Sowjetunion appointed District Director.\nFollowing this the SPÖ dominated the district and always appointed the District Director.\nAt the last district election in 2010 the SPÖ reached 43.7% (minus 7.4%),\nthe ÖVP 15.8% (minus 3.6%), the FPÖ 25.2% (plus 11.8%) the Greens 11.9% (minus 0.9%)\nThe BZÖ reached 1.3% (plus 0.2%).\n\nThe present district area of Liesing as before World War I had persistent growth figures,\nbut it lacked comparable, little urbanized areas, such as in Donaustadt or Floridsdorf.\nNevertheless, the still independent communities could triple their population of 13945 (1869) to 38047 (1910).\nThen, the population stagnated after the end of the second world war. After the communities, in 1954,\nwere finally joined, as the District of Liesing, to Vienna, the population began to rise again continuously.\nThe strongest growth spurt was in the 1960s. Through the rebuilding of the areas between the old village cores,\nwith modern residential properties, the population rose to 2006 with 89,986 people. Nevertheless,\nLiesing is still the most under-populated district of Vienna. In 2005, only three districts were\nas thinly populated as Liesing, with 2741 inhabitants/km.\nThe population structure of Liesing, in 2005, mainly lay in the average for Vienna, although the age group\nbetween 55 and 74 was significantly over-represented. The number of children under 15 years of age\nwas 14.8 percent of the district population, while the average of Vienna was 14.6%. The proportion of the\npopulation between 15 and 59 years was 60.7% (Vienna: 63.4%), below the average,\nwhile people aged 60 or more years were 24.6% (Vienna: 22.0%) of the district population.\n\nThe gender distribution of the District, in 2001, was 46.6% men and 53.4% women.\nThe number of the married population was, with a share of 44.7% compared with 41.2%, above the average for Vienna.\n\nThe proportion of foreign population, in 2005, amounted to 8.9 percent (versus Vienna citywide: 18.7%).\nThis was the lowest value of a Vienna district. As in the entire state, the proportion of foreigners has\ngrown, as in 2001, the proportion was at 6.7 percent. The highest proportion of foreigners, in 2005, were,\nwith 1.7% share of the district population, citizens from Serbia and Montenegro. Another 1.1%\nwere German, 0.8% Turkish, 0.7% Polish and Croatian 0.6% respectively Bosnian citizens.\n\nAs a whole, in 2001, 14.2% of the district population were not born in Austria. Nearly 2.4% reported their common\nlanguage as Serbian, 1.6% as Turkish, and 1.4 as Croatian.\n\nLiesing has one of the highest population shares of people with Roman Catholic faith, 55.2%, compared with Vienna overall at 49.2%,\ndue to a very low foreign share. Eleven Catholic Parishes form the town Deconate 23 in the municipality.\nOn the other hand, the proportions of people with Islamic faith with 3.2%, and of Orthodox faith, with 2.5%,\nare both below the average (Vienna citywide: 7.8% or 6%). The proportion of the Evangelical people\nwas 6.7% of the district population, the second highest in Vienna.\nNearly 27.3% of the district population, in 2001, belonged to no religion, where this was the 3rd highest\nvalue of a Vienna district. Another 5.1% of the population had expressed either none or some other religion.\n\n\n\n"}

No formalities, such as copyright registration, are necessary to obtain all the exclusive rights that the Dutch copyright provides. The duration of a copyright is generally 70 years after the death of the author. The term \"work\" includes many materials, such as books, brochures, films, photographs, musical works, works of visual art and geographical maps. Furthermore, the Dutch Supreme Court has ruled that to be considered a work, it should have its own, original character with the personal imprint of the author (HR 4 January 1991, NJ 1991, 608(Van Dale/Romme)). This threshold of originality has since been superseded by a decision of the European Court of Justice (C-5/08) and is now \"The author's own intellectual Creation\".\n\nThe exclusive right to publish a work includes amongst others the publication of a copy of (part of) the work, the public recitation thereof and to rent or lend (part of) the work to public institutions. The exclusive right to duplicate a work includes amongst others the recording, the translation, the music arrangement and the adaptation for the screen of the work.\n\nCopyright laws differ between countries. However, there are several international treaties concerning copyright that harmonise copyright to a certain extent. The Netherlands is a signature state to among others:\n\n\nSince the Netherlands is a member state of the European Union all directives and regulations of the European Union apply in the Netherlands. As such copyright in the Netherlands has some specific features over the Copyright law of the European Union\n\n\nLimitations and exceptions to copyright are harmonised in the 2001 Information Society Directive of the European Union. This directive allows 21 specific limitations or exceptions. Of this list only temporary acts of reproductions is a mandatory exception to copyright within the European Union. The Netherlands has adopted 17 of these limitations and exceptions: \n\nThe Information Society Directive also allows for pre-existing limitations and exceptions that existed in national legislation prior to the adoption of the directive. The Netherlands has four further notable limitations and exceptions to copyright:\n\nIn certain circumstances, one is allowed to make a copy of copyright materials. This is also called a homecopy.\nAccording to Dutch \"Auteurswet\" article 16b and 16c § 1, and \"Wet op de Naburige rechten\" article 10, 'reproducing a piece of literature, science or art' is not seen as infringement to copyright if in line with the following:\n\nOn 10 April 2014 the \"European Court of Justice\" ruled the Dutch exclusion for home-copying to be infringing the directive 2001/29/EG - article 5 § 2- b and § 5. According to EU directive, this makes homecopying unlawful. There have been other cases in which Dutch \"Auteurswet\" has been ruled unlawful. The Netherlands however has not changed said article nor complied to the request to make prosecuting those whom homecopy possible.\n\nHistorically, governments issued \"monopolierechten\" (monopoly-rights) to publishers for the sale of printed work. Great Britain was the first to change this in 1710 with the Statute of Anne, which stated that authors, not publishers, had the right to claim a monopoly on the work. It also entailed protection for buyers of printed work in that publishers were no longer allowed to control the use of sold works. Furthermore, it limited exclusive rights to 28 years, after which the work or works would be released to the public domain.\n\nThe Berne Convention in 1886 was the first multilateral treaty to provide for reciprocal treatment of copyrights among sovereign nations. Under the Berne Convention the right of ownership (\"eigendomsrecht\" in Dutch) was automatically granted to every creative work. The author no longer needed to register the work, and was not required to apply for copyright coverage.\n\nThe Berne Convention is still in effect today. When a work is finished (defined as being written or recorded on a physical medium), the author automatically receives all exclusive rights for that work as well as derivatives, unless and until the author explicitly renounces those rights or the copyright expires. The expiration time differs from country to country, but according to the Berne Convention the minimum duration is the lifetime of the author plus 50 years.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Gray Television. KAIT's studios are located on New Haven Church Road (County Road 766) north of Jonesboro, and its transmitter is located in Egypt, Arkansas.\n\nKAIT first signed on July 15, 1963 as an independent station, a venture of Fort Smith businessman George Hernreich. It has been affiliated with ABC since 1965. \n\nMost television markets in the country received at least two VHF commercial channels. However, the Jonesboro market could only receive \"one\" VHF license because it was sandwiched between Springfield (channels 3 and 10) to the west, Memphis (channels 3, 5, 10, and 13) to the east, Cape Girardeau (channels 3, 6, 8, and 12) to the north, and Little Rock (channels 2, 4, 7, and 11) to the south. KAIT was fortunate to receive this license, and as a result became the only television station to serve Jonesboro until KTEJ signed on the air in May 1976.\n\nThe Hernreich family sold the station to Channel Communications in 1984. That company, in turn, sold KAIT to Cosmos Broadcasting, the broadcasting arm of South Carolina-based insurer Liberty Corporation, in 1986. Liberty exited the insurance business in 2000, bringing the Cosmos stations directly under the Liberty banner. Previous owner Raycom Media obtained the station in 2005 through its purchase of Liberty. For many years, KAIT also operated a low-powered translator station K11JW operating on Channel 11 in nearby Blytheville, Arkansas.\n\nKATV (channel 7) and KARK (channel 4) and the signals of other Little Rock area VHF stations adequately covered parts of the KAIT viewing area before the digital transition. Several cable systems in the KAIT viewing area, including Jonesboro and Blytheville, have carried KATV for decades. In compliance with syndex and must-carry regulations, some systems may black out KATV and KARK when either station airs the same program as KAIT, usually during the daytime and prime time hours, except for breaking news, weather bulletins, and regularly-scheduled newscasts. Other cable systems in parts of the KAIT viewing area that are within in the Little Rock television market that also carry KATV, such as in Searcy and Heber Springs, carry both stations without restrictions.\n\nKAIT has been digital-only since June 12, 2009. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 9 to channel 8 for post-transition operations.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including KAIT, and Gray's 93 television stations) under the former's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion – in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom – will result in Gray's entry into Arkansas with KAIT. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn addition to the ABC network schedule, syndicated programming on KAIT includes \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", and \"Judge Judy\", among others.\n\nKAIT-DT2 is the NBC-affiliated second digital subchannel of KAIT. Over the air, KAIT-DT2 broadcasts a 720p high definition signal (downconverted from the native 1080i resolution of the NBC network, to preserve bandwidth so that KAIT-DT3 can transmit in 720p HD over-the-air) on virtual and VHF channel 8.2; however, a direct-to-cable full 1080i high definition feed of this subchannel is available on select cable providers.\n\nKAIT began carrying NBC programming on its second digital subchannel on January 26, 2015. In addition to the NBC network schedule, syndicated programming on KAIT-DT2 includes \"Jeopardy!\", \"Dr. Phil\", \"Inside Edition\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", and \"Right This Minute\", among others. \n\nKAIT-DT3 is the CW-affiliated third digital subchannel of KAIT, broadcasting in 720p high definition on virtual and VHF channel 8.3 (hence the on-air branding KAIT CW 8.3). All programming on KAIT-DT3 is received through The CW's programming feed for smaller media markets, The CW Plus, which provides a set schedule of syndicated programming acquired by The CW for broadcast during time periods outside of the network's regular programming hours; however, Gray Television handles local advertising and promotional services for the subchannel. Upon its inception, KAIT-DT3 had been broadcast in the widescreen standard definition picture format as, meanwhile, a direct-to-cable 720p high definition feed of this subchannel had been made available on select cable providers; however, ever since an upgrade to KAIT's multiplexer equipment sometime in October 2019, KAIT-DT3 has been broadcasting in HD over-the-air as well.\n\nOn July 25, 2018, KAIT announced it would be bringing The CW programming (via their national CW+ service) into the Jonesboro market through a third subchannel, starting on September 1, 2018; CW programming had previously been seen on cable systems under the false call sign \"KJOS\" (which stood for K-JOneSboro's WB 21). \"KJOS\" seamlessly became associated with the new CW network (branded as \"Jonesboro's CW 21\") on September 18, 2006 after the merger of The WB and UPN into that one network.\n\nKAIT presently broadcasts 24½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nIn addition to reporting on local news stories, members of KAIT's reporting staff are also employed as photojournalists for the station. On October 15, 2007 beginning with the 5 p.m. newscast, KAIT's local newscasts were rebranded, replacing the former \"K8 News\" branding with \"Region 8 News\", a branding the station had used during much of the 1980s. The station's longtime slogan \"Good Neighbors You Can Turn To\" (also \"Your Good Neighbor Station\") was also replaced with a new slogan (\"Always Tracking. Always Watching. Always On.\")\n\nOn September 16, 2011, KAIT announced that upgrade its newscasts to high definition, and broadcast from a new set; the following night, fellow ABC affiliate KATV in Little Rock started broadcasting its local newscasts in HD. On October 17, 2011 beginning with its 11 a.m. newscast, KAIT became the fourth station in Arkansas (the first in Jonesboro) to broadcast its local newscast in high definition.\n\nAlthough not owned by the same company, KAIT frequently forms a partnership with the Jonesboro Radio Group for community projects and promotions. The three Jonesboro Radio Group stations involved in the partnership are KEGI 100.5 FM, KDXY 104.9 FM and KJBX 106.3 FM. An audio simulcast of KAIT's 6 p.m. newscast airs Monday-Friday evenings on KJBX.\n\n\nKAIT's home market only comprises Craighead, Clay, Greene, Jackson, Lawrence, Randolph, and Sharp counties in Arkansas. With KAIT's 28,200 watts worth of effective radiated power, KAIT's signal can extend into nearby portions of all neighboring markets (e.g. the Memphis, Little Rock, Springfield, MO, and Cape Girardeau, MO–Paducah, KY markets). Even after the digital transition of 2009, KAIT's over-the-air signal can still be picked up as far south as Forrest City, as far north as Hendrickson, Missouri, as far west as Mountain View and as far east as Tiptonville, Tennessee and Caruthersville, Missouri. Some of the northern suburbs of Memphis can also pick up at least a grade B signal.\n\nKAIT was dropped from New Wave Communications in Southeast Missouri, in favor of in-market ABC affiliate WSIL and NBC affiliate WPSD on December 31, 2017.\n\n"}

Whether light is affected by gravity under Newtonian mechanics is unclear but if it were accelerated the same way as projectiles, any light emitted at the surface of a dark star would be trapped by the star's gravity, rendering it dark, hence the name. Dark stars are analogous to black holes in general relativity.\n\nDuring 1783 geologist John Michell wrote a letter to Henry Cavendish outlining the expected properties of dark stars, published by The Royal Society in their 1784 volume. Michell calculated that when the escape velocity at the surface of a star was equal to or greater than lightspeed, the generated light would be gravitationally trapped so that the star would not be visible to a distant astronomer.\n\nMichell's idea for calculating the number of such \"invisible\" stars anticipated 20th century astronomers' work: he suggested that since a certain proportion of double-star systems might be expected to contain at least one \"dark\" star, we could search for and catalogue as many double-star systems as possible, and identify cases where only a single circling star was visible. This would then provide a statistical baseline for calculating the amount of other unseen stellar matter that might exist in addition to the visible stars.\n\nMichell also suggested that future astronomers might be able to identify the surface gravity of a distant star by seeing how far the star's light was shifted to the weaker end of the spectrum, a precursor of Einstein's 1911 gravity-shift argument. However, Michell cited Newton as saying that blue light was less energetic than red (Newton thought that more massive particles were associated with bigger wavelengths), so Michell's predicted spectral shifts were in the wrong direction. It is difficult to tell whether Michell's careful citing of Newton's position on this may have reflected a lack of conviction on Michell's part over whether Newton was correct or just academic thoroughness.\n\nIn 1796, the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book \"Exposition du système du Monde\", independently of Michell.\n\nBecause of the development of the wave theory of light, Laplace may have removed it from later editions as light became to be thought of as a massless wave, and therefore not influenced by gravity and as a group, physicists dropped the idea although the German physicist, mathematician, and astronomer Johann Georg von Soldner continued with Newton's corpuscular theory of light as late as 1804.\n\nDark stars and black holes both have a surface escape velocity equal or greater than lightspeed, and a critical radius of \"r\" ≤ 2\"M\".\n\nHowever, the dark star is capable of emitting indirect radiation – outward-aimed light and matter can leave the \"r\" = 2\"M\" surface briefly before being recaptured, and while outside the critical surface, can interact with other matter, or be accelerated free from the star through such interactions. A dark star, therefore, has a rarefied atmosphere of \"visiting particles\", and this ghostly halo of matter and light can radiate, albeit weakly. Also as Faster than light speeds are possible in Newtonian mechanics, it is possible for particles to escape.\n\n\n\n"}

In the early 1940s, three Nebraska cities, Kearney, Grand Island and Hastings joined to form the Central Nebraska Defense Council when it was learned that the United States Army Air Forces was considering the site for a military airfield. The group attempted to convince Washington that central Nebraska was suitable. Kearney and Grand Island effectively competed as locations for defense airports which would serve as storage for aircraft made at Offutt Field and the Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant near Omaha.\n\nAs early as 1941 the City of Kearney voted on a $60,000 bond to finance a new airport. Kearney Regional Airport began as Keens Municipal Airport. The cost was more than $360,000, with the balance funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Construction began at the site on Highway 30 on October 21, 1941, and was dedicated as Keens Airport on August 23, 1942, with asphalt runways and one hangar. A handful of buildings from the military era remain at Kearney Airport, notably Hangar #385.\n\nThe first airline flights were Mid-West Cessna 190s in 1950-52, then Frontier DC-3s appeared in 1959.

Despite this, no religious laws had yet been adopted for government and judicial protocols and civil governance, until the mid 1970s with the coming of General Muhammed Zia Ul-Haq in a military coup also known as Operation Fair Play which deposed the Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n\nZia-ul-Haq committed himself to enforcing his interpretation of \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (\"Rule of the prophet\" Muhammad), i.e. to establish an Islamic state and enforce \"sharia\" law.\n\nZia established separate Shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine.\nNew criminal offenses (of adultery, fornication, and types of blasphemy), and new punishments (of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death), were added to Pakistani law. Interest payments for bank accounts were replaced by \"profit and loss\" payments. \"Zakat\" charitable donations became a 2.5% annual tax. School textbooks and libraries were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material.\nOffices, schools, and factories were required to offer praying space.\nZia bolstered the influence of the \"ulama\" (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties, whilst conservative scholars became fixtures on television.\n10,000s of activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party were appointed to government posts to ensure the continuation of his agenda after his passing. Conservative \"ulama\" (Islamic scholars) were added to the Council of Islamic Ideology.\n\nIn 1984 a referendum gave Zia and the Islamization program, 97.7% approval in official results. However, there have been protests against the laws and their enforcement during and after Zia's reign. Women's and human rights groups opposed incarceration of rape victims under \"hadd\" punishments, new laws that valued women's testimony (Law of Evidence) and blood money compensation (\"diyat\") at half that of a man. Religious minorities and human rights groups opposed the \"vaguely worded\" Blasphemy Law and the \"malicious abuse and arbitrary enforcement\" of it.\n\nPossible motivations for the Islamisation programme included Zia's personal piety (most accounts agree that he came from a religious family), desire to gain political allies, to \"fulfill Pakistan's \"raison d'etre\"\" as a Muslim state, and/or the political need to legitimise what was seen by some Pakistanis as his \"repressive, un-representative martial law regime\".\nHow much success Zia had strengthening Pakistan's national cohesion with state-sponsored Islamisation is disputed. Shia-Sunni religious riots broke out over differences in Islamic jurisprudence (\"fiqh\") – in particular, over how \"Zakat\" donations would be distributed. \nThere were also differences among Sunni Muslims.\n\nThe Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), a coalition of Islamist political parties in Pakistan, calls for the increased Islamization of the government and society, specifically taking an anti-Hindu stance. The MMA leads the opposition in the national assembly, held a majority in the NWFP Provincial Assembly, and was part of the ruling coalition in Balochistan. However, some members of the MMA made efforts to eliminate their rhetoric against Hindus.\n\nEven more Islamization has happened by religious conversions in Pakistan.\n\nPakistan was founded on the basis of securing a sovereign homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent to live in self-determination.\n\nThe idea of Pakistan had received overwhelming popular support among British Indian Muslims, especially those in the Presidencies and provinces of British India where Muslims were in a minority such as U.P. The Muslim League leadership, ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah had articulated their vision of Pakistan in terms of an Islamic state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama. When Jinnah died, Islamic scholar Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani described Jinnah as the greatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and also compared Jinnah's death to the Prophet's passing. Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember Jinnah's message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream:to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from Pakistan to Morocco. He [Jinnah] wanted to see the Muslims of the world united under the banner of Islam as an effective check against the aggressive designs of their enemies.The first formal step taken to transform Pakistan into an ideological Islamic state was in March 1949 when the country's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, introduced the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly. The Objectives Resolution declared that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty. The president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, announced that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity. Khaliq believed that Pakistan was only a Muslim state and was not yet an Islamic state, but that it could certainly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit. Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world:Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims. Other Muslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this assumed that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between religion and nationality.However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments were not shared by other Muslim governments at the time. Nationalism in other parts of the Muslim world was based on ethnicity, language and culture. Although Muslim governments were unsympathetic with Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from all over the world were drawn to Pakistan. Figures such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of Islamist political movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, became frequent visitors to the country. After General Zia-ul-Haq took power in a military coup, Hizb ut-Tahrir (an Islamist group calling for the establishment of a Caliphate) expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan. Its founder, Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, would maintain regular correspondence with Abul A’la Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), and he also urged Dr Israr Ahmed to continue his work in Pakistan for the establishment of a global caliphate.\n\nSocial scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed conducted a survey in 1969 in pre-divided Pakistan on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that over 60% of people in East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh) professed to have a secular national identity. However, in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) the same figure professed to have an Islamic and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in East Pakistan defined their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not Islam. But it was the opposite in West Pakistan where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity.\n\nAfter Pakistan's first ever general elections the 1973 Constitution was created by an elected Parliament. The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam.\n\nOn 5 July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq led a coup d'état. In the year or two before Zia-ul-Haq's coup, his predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had faced vigorous opposition which was united under the revivalist banner of \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (\"Rule of the prophet\"). According to supporters of the movement, establishing an Islamic state based on \"sharia\" law would mean a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet Muhammad ruled the Muslims. In an effort to stem the tide of street Islamisation, Bhutto had also called for it and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing.\n\nOn coming to power, Zia went much further than Bhutto, committing himself to enforcing \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\", i.e. \"sharia\" law. Most accounts confirm that Zia came from a religious family and religion played an important part in molding his personality. His father worked as a civilian official in army headquarters and was known as <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Maulvi<nowiki>\"</nowiki> Akbar Ali due to his religious devotion. Zia-ul-Haq joined the army before partition and occasionally offended his British superiors with his refusal to give up religious and cultural traditions. Zia attributed his personal resistance to the lifestyle of the British Indian cavalry to his faith in <nowiki>\"</nowiki>God and his teachings.<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\n\nIn his first televised speech to the country as head of state he declared that \nPakistan which was created in the name of Islam will continue to survive only if it sticks to Islam. That is why I consider the introduction of [an] Islamic system as an essential prerequisite for the country.\nWhile in the past, \"many a ruler did what they pleased in the name of Islam,\" he would not.\n\nUnlike in Iran, Islamisation in Pakistan was politically conservative, working against, not with leftist forces and ideas. Zia had little sympathy with Bhutto or his populist, socialist philosophy—captured in the slogan, \"\"Food, clothing, and shelter\"\".\nGeneral Zia explained in an interview in 1979 given to British journalist Ian Stephens:\n\nWhile Zia initiated the Islamisation programme, he came under attack from conservative Sunni forces who considered his process too slow. He distanced himself from some of the ulama in 1980, \nand in 1983 religious opponents spread the rumour that Zia was an Ahmadi. Zia was \"forced to deny this allegation publicly and denounce the Ahmadis as \"kafirs\" (infidels)\".\n\nIn 1984 a referendum was held on Zia, the Islamization program, and giving him a five-year presidential term. Official results reported 97.7 in favor and voter participation of 60%. Independent observers questioned whether 30% of eligible voters had voted.\n\nOpposition to state-sponsored Islamisation or aspects of it came from several quarters. Religious riots broke out in 1983 and 1984. Sectarian divisions between Sunnis and Shia worsened over the issue of the 1979 \"Zakat\" ordinance, but differences in \"fiqh\" jurisprudence also arose in marriage and divorce, inheritance and wills and imposition of hadd punishments.\n\nAmong Sunni Muslims, there were disputes between Deobandis and Barelvis. Zia favored Deobandi doctrine and the Sufi pirs of Sindh (who were Barelvi) joined the anti-Zia Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.\n\nOne of the first and most controversial Islamisation measures was the replacement of parts of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) with the 1979 \"Hudood Ordinance.\" (Hudood meaning limits or restrictions, as in limits of acceptable behavior in Islamic law.) The Ordinance added new criminal offenses of adultery and fornication to Pakistani law, and new punishments of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death.\n\nFor theft or robbery, the PPC punishments of imprisonment or fine, or both, were replaced by amputation of the right hand of the offender for theft, and amputation of the right hand and left foot for robbery.\nFor \"Zina\" (extramarital sex) the provisions relating to adultery were replaced by the Ordinance with punishments of flogged 100 lashes for those unmarried offenders, and stoning to death for married offenders.\n\nAll these \"Hudood\" punishments were the maximum punishments, dependent on \"Hudd\" proof—four Muslim men of good repute testifying as witness to the crime—being met. In practice, as of 2014, the Hudd requirement has not yet been met and no offender has been stoned or had limbs amputated by the Pakistani judicial system. The less strict \"tazir\" standards—where the punishment was some combination of imprisonment, fines and/or flogging—was applied and many offenders have been publicly flogged.\n\nMore worrisome for human rights and women's rights advocates, some lawyers and politicians, was the incarceration of thousands of rape victims on charges of \"zina\".\nMixing the Pakistan penal code with Islamic laws was difficult because of the difference in the underlying logic of the two legal systems.\n\n\"Drinking of wine\" (and all other alcoholic drinks) was not a crime under the original Pakistan Penal Code, but in 1977, the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims was banned in Pakistan, punishable by imprisonment of six months or a fine of Rs. 5000/-, or both. Under Zia's Prohibition Order, this punishment was replaced by one of whipping of eighty stripes, (citing an \"Ijma\" (consensus opinion) of the Companions of Muhammad since the period of the Second Caliph Umar). Non-Muslims were excepted if they obtained a license to drink and/or manufacture alcoholic beverages from the Government.\n\nThe most controversial of the ordinances was the \"Zina\" Ordinance, by which the Pakistan Penal Code provisions relating to adultery were replaced. Women and men found guilty were to be flogged a hundred stripes apiece if unmarried, and stoned to death if married. Uncorroborated testimony by women was inadmissible in hudood crimes, so in cases of rape, victims were sometimes charged with fornication and jailed and their rapists were freed because the women could not comply with the Islamic Hadd requirements of four reputable Muslim males testifying to the crime. Girls as young as twelve were also sometimes jailed and prosecuted for having extra-marital intercourse because the ordinance abolished Pakistan's statutory rape law.\n\nAccording to legal scholar Martin Lau, \nWhile it was easy to file a case against a woman accusing her of adultery, the Zina Ordinance made it very difficult for a woman to obtain bail pending trial. Worse, in actual practice, the vast majority of accused women were found guilty by the trial court only to be acquitted on appeal to the Federal Shariat Court. By then they had spent many years in jail, were ostracized by their families, and had become social outcasts.\n\nIn 1979, before the ordinances went into effect there were 70 women held in Pakistani prisons. By 1988, there were 6000. Critics complained that the law had become a way for \"vengeful husbands and parents\" to punish their wives or daughters for disobedience, but that \"whenever even small changes\" were proposed, religious groups and political parties staged \"large scale demonstrations\" in opposition.\n\nPakistani women's and human rights groups protested the law, and international media gave it publicity. Supporters defended the Ordinances' punishments as ordained by God and the law as the victim of \"extremely unjust propaganda\" in the media.\n\nThe first conviction and sentence of stoning to death, in September 1981, was overturned under national and international pressure. A conviction for adultery of a 13-year-old blind girl, (Safia Bibi), who alleged rape by her employer and his son, was reversed and the conviction was set aside on appeal after bitter public criticism.\nAnother conviction for zina and sentence of stoning to death in early 1988 sparked more public outrage and led to a retrial and acquittal by the Federal Sharia Court.\n\nAttention to the problematic nature of the Ordinance and suggestions for revising it were given by a number of government appointed commissions and a televised several weeks-long-televised debate on the subject. In 2006, parts of the law were extensively revised by the Women's Protection Bill.\n\nIn 1978 Zia established \"Shariat Appellate Benches\", \"grafted\" on to Pakistan's four High Courts. \nThe benches were tasked with judging legal cases using the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah, \nand examining the country's laws to determine whether they complied with \"sharia\" law, and bring them into alignment if they did not.\nA Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court was created to be the final authority in \"Sharia\" cases.\n\nIn announcing the establishment of Shariat Benches, Zia described their jurisdiction: \"Every citizen will have the right to present any law enforced by the government before the 'Sharia Bench' and obtain its verdict whether the law is wholly or partly Islamic or un-Islamic.\" \nHowever, some very important laws were exempt from being struck down as un-Islamic.\n\nThe Ninth Amendment to the Pakistan Constitution, added by Zia's government, stated that \"the Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah shall be the supreme law and source of guidance for legislation\", but qualified that in Article 203-B by omitting from the rule: the constitution, \"Muslim Personal Law, any law relating to the procedure of any Court or tribunal\", and \"until the expiration of ten years from the commencement of this Chapter, any fiscal law or any law relating to the levy and collection of taxes and fees or banking or insurance practice and procedure ...\" Thus the constitution and major parts of Pakistan's laws were exempt from Sharia jurisdiction. Further, the Shariat Benches did not always follow Zia's policy, and early on declared \"rajm\", or stoning, to be un-Islamic. Zia-ul-Haq reconstituted the court, which then ruled \"rajm\" Islamic.\n\nIn 1980 the Shariat Appellate Benches were disbanded and replaced by a Federal Shariat Court (FSC). Its establishment was less than clean and simple, as between 1980 and 1985, \"provisions relating to the FSC's operation were modified 28 times, through the mechanism of 12 separate presidential ordinances and were incorporated into the Constitution in 14 subsections covering 11 pages of text.\" It has eight judges appointed by the president, \"selected for the most part from judges of the high courts\".\n\nThe judges of the superior courts appointed by General Zia tended to be \"Islamic moderates\" rather than \"Islamic activists\" favoring a rapid advance of Islamisation.\n\nIn the lower district courts, there is \"considerable variation in the enforcement and interpretation of the Hudood laws\", with \"much more enthusiasm\" for implementation of them in the Punjab and urban Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly NWFP) than in other regions.\n\nTo outlaw blasphemy, the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) were amended through ordinances in 1980, 1982 and 1986. \n\nThe legal language forbidding of blasphemy is quite complete, stating\n\nWhoever, with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places any object in the sight of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\n\nPrior to 1986, only 14 cases pertaining to blasphemy were reported in Pakistan. From 1987 to 2014 over 1300 people have been accused of blasphemy, mostly non-Muslim religious minorities. The vast majority of the accusations were lodged for desecration of the Quran.\n\nThe laws are controversial among the small liberal community in Pakistan and international human rights organizations.\nAccording to one religious minority source, an accusation of blasphemy commonly subjects the accused, police, lawyers, and judges to harassment, threats, attacks and rioting. Critics complain that Pakistan's blasphemy law \"is overwhelmingly being used to persecute religious minorities and settle personal vendettas,\" but calls for change in the blasphemy laws have been strongly resisted by Islamic parties. As of 2014 no one has been legally executed for blasphemy, but 17 people are on death row for the crime, and a considerable number of accused of or connected with the issue have been killed at the hands of mob or other vigilante violence.\n\nOver 50 people accused of blasphemy have been murdered before their respective trials were over, and prominent figures who opposed blasphemy laws (Salman Taseer, the former governor of Punjab, and Shahbaz Bhatti, the Federal Minister for Minorities) have been assassinated after urging reform of the law. Altogether, since 1990, 62 people have been murdered as a result of blasphemy allegations. There has also been at least one case of an attack on a non-Muslim faith registered under the blasphemy laws.\n\nThe depth of passion and vigour of vigilantism against blasphemy was in evidence in a 21 April 1994 incident in Gujranwala where a doctor, Sajjad Farooq, was beaten, stoned, doused with kerosene and set alight, and dragged through the streets tied to a motorbike by a group of people after an announcement was made over the loudspeakers of several local mosques that 'a Christian had burned a copy of the Koran' and that people should come forward to stone him to death. It later transpired that Farooq was not a Christian but a devout Muslim, but one with enemies with access to local mosque public address systems. As of late 1994, a complaint had been lodged against five people but no arrests appeared to have been made.\n\nAccusations of blasphemy in Pakistan have also often led to mob violence and forced conversion to Islam in Pakistan. Attacks on Christian and Hindu minorities in Pakistan could be part of a militant plan to send a message to the West or embarrass the civilian governments of the country when they appear to be too friendly to the West.\n\nIn the short term, the fiscal dimension of the Islamization policy made a stronger impact. Payment of the alms tax, Zakat, as well as its agricultural counterpart, Ushr, were traditionally private obligations for Muslims in Pakistan. Together they generally represented 2.5% of annual household savings and served as a sort of wealth tax to be redistributed to the Muslim community's poor. One of the provisions of the 1973 constitution already stipulated that these taxes should be collected by the government. But Bhutto had made no move to implement it. In 1979, Zia decided to transform what was considered a personal duty of solidarity into a legal obligation. The \"Zakat and Ushr Ordinance\" was issued on 20 June 1980. Its urban component,\"zakat\", took effect in 1981, whereas \"ushr\" did not come into effect until 1983. The system by which these taxes were previously levied was replaced by a specific agency to rationalize the collection & distribution of funds, a process that Malik describes as follows:\n\nOn the first day of the fasting month of Ramadan, the Zakat Deducting Agencies (banks,post-offices etc.) by means of deduction at source withdraw 2.5% from all saving accounts above a certain exemption limit (fixed at Rs. 1,000 in the first year of Zakat deduction, 1980). They transfer the Zakat thus collected to the Central Zakat Fund (CZF). This fund is fed also with proceeds from 'voluntary Zakat' and 'donations' and from funds of other institutions. Following certain criteria, the Zakat is then distributed among the Provincial Zakat Funds (PZFs) and the National Zakat Foundation (NZF). Following prescribed quota, the PZFs turn over funds to the Local Zakat Funds (LZFs), to other institutions, to the needy (mustaqhin) and to the National Zakat Foundation.\n\nWhile \"ushr\" is distributed in the locality where it was collected, the distribution process of the \"zakat\" shows a whole bureaucratic pyramid in action. Here again, the Islamization policy reinforced state control over religious institutions. Further evidence of this was the Tehsil/Taluka/Subdivisional and Local Committees (Removal of Chairman and Members) Rule (1981), which allowed the state to dismiss the president of a local Zakat Committee, an institution that was previously independent of the state. In 1981, \"Al Zakat\", an influential national monthly publication boasted that 250,000 persons were involved in the new system of collecting and distributing zakat funds.\nThe fiscal dimension of Zia's Islamization policy fostered a rise in sectarianism, a term that in Pakistan denotes the conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims. As soon as Zia's plans for \"zakat\" and \"ushr\" were made public, Shia leaders objected that according to their jurisprudence of their sect, payment of these taxes was a purely individual choice, a decision made according to one's conscience. In reaction to the promulgation of the law, they orchestrated a massive demonstration in Islamabad which later led them to be exempted from the mandatory tax.The taxes have not been found to have eliminated rural and urban poverty or reduced the inequalities in wealth which had become a traditional feature of Pakistani society.\n\nZia publicly stated his desire to eliminate interest on loans and securities and create an \"Interest-free economy.\"\nZia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit-loss sharing (PLS).\nOn 1 January 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks.\n\nIn 1981 interest payments were to be replaced by \"profit and loss\" accounts (though profit was thought to be simply interest by another name). The government introduced and encouraged banks to adopt financing schemes based upon \"murabaha\" and or \"musharaka\"\n\nZia did not consider land reform or trade union activity to be part of Islamic economics.\nIn a statement addressed to the poor and working class he opined: \nIt is not for the employers to provide \"roti, kapda, aur makaan\" (bread, clothes and homes) [a reference to a well-known slogan used by Bhutto's PPP]. It was for God Almighty who is the provider of livelihood to his people. Trust in God and He will bestow upon you an abundance of good things in life. His martial law government also made it clear that it \"was not committed to redistributive agrarian policies and described the land reforms as ordinary politics to reward supporters and punish enemies\".\n\nWhen, on 13 December 1980, the Federal Shariat Court declared the land reforms of 1972 and 1977 to be in consonance with Islamic injunctions, Zia responded by inducting three members of the \"Ulema\" (Islamic scholars) into the Federal Sharia Court and two into the Sharia Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court (\"Ulema\" traditionally often coming from, or at least supporting the interests of, the landowning class). The newly constituted courts reversed the FSC judgment in 1990.\n\nAfter the imposition of martial law, thousands of tenants were forcibly evicted from the land in various districts.\n\nAnother source, scholar Charles H. Kennedy, states that from 1978 to 1992, the \"Islamic Courts\" established by Islamisation (i.e. the Shariah Appellate Bench and Federal Shariat Court) were much more important in land reform policy than either the executive or legislature of Pakistan. Kennedy states they effectively \"suspended implementation\" of the land reforms, \"repealed the reforms, drafted new legislation, and then interpreted the new laws' meanings\".\n\nTrade union and grass roots demands for higher wages, better working conditions, social security, old age benefits and compensation for accidents, were \"no justification for protests and strikes\", and treated as disorder to be suppressed. Maximum punishment to the offenders was three years rigorous imprisonment and/or whipping. On 2 January 1986 police killed 19 striking workers of the Colony Textile Mill in Multan, whose management had sought assistance from the authorities.\n\nAttempts were made to enforce praying of salat five times a day.\n\nSeparate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985—a policy originally proposed by Islamist leader Abul A'la Maududi. Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from county's political process, but the policy had strong support from Islamists.\n\nIn 1990 \"Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Ordinance\" on \"Qisas\" (\"retaliation\" or revenge) and \"Diyat\" (financial compensation paid to the heirs of a victim), was introduced after the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court declared that the lack of \"Qisas\" and \"Diyat\" were repugnant to the injunctions of Islam as laid down by the Quran and Sunnah. (These laws were introduced after Zia died, but by a court—Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court—that Zia had created.)\n\nUnder the law, the victim (or heirs of the victim) of a crime had the right to inflict injuries on the offender identical to the ones sustained by the victim. (Although the ordinance set the \"blood money\" compensation for a women victim at half that for a male.) The law also allows offenders to absolve themselves of the crime by paying compensation to the victim or their heirs if, and only if, the family of the victim is willing to accept it.\n\nA proposed Law of Evidence (\"Qanun-e-Shahadat\") would require two women to testify in place of one man. After protest and demonstrations against the law, a 1984 compromise limited the rule to financial transactions.\nAccording to Charles Kennedy, it is unlikely that the law will affect any case brought to any superior court in Pakistan because \"in practice, virtually every financial transaction in Pakistan by custom or rule requires the countersignature of several individuals.\"\n\nUnlike men, women entering into legal contracts were required to have their signature witness by another person.\n\nInstructions were issued for regular observance of prayers and arrangements were made for performing noon prayer (Salat Al Zuhur) in government and quasi-government offices and educational institutions, during office hours, and official functions, and at airports, railway stations and bus stops.\n\nAn \"Ehtram-e-Ramazan\" (reverence for fasting) Ordinance was issued banning eating, smoking, and drinking in public places. According to a clause of this ordinance, those places including restaurants, canteens, bridges, lanes, and even the confines of private homes. While in theory the non-Muslim minority of Pakistan is exempt from the law, minorities have been arrested for eating in public.\n\n\nUnder Zia, the order for women to cover their heads while in public was implemented in public schools, colleges and state television. Women's participation in sports and the performing arts was severely restricted.\n\nThe Ansari commission, which from the 1980s onwards advised the President on un-Islamic social conventions, recommended that women should be prohibited from leaving the country without a male escort and that unmarried, unaccompanied women should not be allowed to serve overseas in the diplomatic corps. An Islamic dress code was imposed on women in the public eye such as newsreaders and air stewardesses. \nTextbooks were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material, and un-Islamic books were removed from libraries.\nOffices, schools, and factories were required to offer praying space; conservative scholars became fixtures on television. The Government built mosques in rural areas, giving the rural people greater access to mullahs. It also appointed many mullahs to advisory groups.\n\nAccording to Pervez Hoodbhoy, a Pakistani physicist opposed to fundamentalism, under Zia the government organized international conferences and provided funding for research on such topics as the temperature of hell and the chemical nature of \"jinn\" (supernatural creatures made from fire).\n\nIn prisons, religious instruction is mandatory. Those who can demonstrate their ability to recite the Quran from memory before an examination board are entitled to a remission in their sentence of up to two years.\n\nEducational reforms partly flowed from judicial reforms insofar as, for instance, a sharia department was set up at Quaid-e-Azam University in 1979 to train Islamic legal specialists. But Zia devoted personal attention to the reorganization of Quranic schools (\"dini madaris\", plural of \"madrasssa\").Madrassass (traditional religious schools) in Pakistan received state sponsorship for the first time.\nTheir number grew from 893 to 2,801 during the Zia years according to one source. Another states that 12,000 were opened from 1983-4. Most were Deobandi in doctrinal orientation, while one quarter of them were Barelvi. They received funding from Zakat councils and provided free religious training, room and board to impoverished Pakistanis. \nThe schools, which banned televisions and radios, have been criticized by authors for stoking sectarian hatred both between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims.\n\nIn a 1979 address to the nation, Zia decried the influence of Western culture and music in the country. Soon afterwards, PTV, the national television network, ceased playing music videos or any music other than patriotic songs. Most of the cinemas in Lahore were shut down. (As of 2004, the \"Lollywood\" film industry of Pakistan produces around 40 films a year, compared to India's thousand or so releases.)\n\nThis was despite warm relations between Zia and the President of the largest Western country (US President Ronald Reagan), and strong support for Zia from that country. \nAlso ironic was that under Zia's rule (according to leftist cultural critic Nadeem F. Paracha), economic prosperity expanded the country's urban middle and lower-middle-classes, and spread the popularity of Western 1980s fashion wear, hairstyle and pop music.\n\nThe common South Asian parting phrase \"Khuda Hafiz\" was discouraged in favour of \"Allah Hafiz\", which was first used in 1985 in the state-run media as it was said to be more Islamic than the former phrase that allowed for religious pluralism.\n\nZia's motivation for the Islamisation programme has been described as including his personal piety, desire \"to fulfil Pakistan's \"raison d'etre\"\" as a Muslim state, and the political need to legitimise what was seen by many as Zia's \"repressive, un-representative martial law regime\".\nZia had come to power overthrowing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose opposition had been united around the slogan of \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (Islamic rule), making supporters of Islamisation the enemy of Zia's enemy.\n\nSecular and leftist forces accused Zia of manipulating Islam for political ends. Nusrat Bhutto, former wife of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto claimed that Zia \"used Islam\" to ensure \"the survival of his own regime\" following the \"horrors of 1971 war\" in East Bengal.\n\nOne author points out that Zia was conspicuously silent on the dispute between the heterodox Zikri sect and the \"`Ulama\" in Balochistan, where Islamist doctrine would call for siding with the conservative \"Ulama\", but where Zia had a political need for tranquility among the Zikri. Another notes Zia's use of Article 203-B to protect any part of the constitution, any Personal Laws, and any financial laws from being struck down as in violation of sharia law.\n\nHow much success Zia had using state-sponsored Islamisation to strengthen national cohesion is also disputed. \nThe Shia Muslim minority differed with Sunnis over Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). The Pakistani government leaned in favour of applying Sunni law to all.\n\nIn particular, dispute over how \"Zakat\" donations for the poor should be distributed fanned sectarian tension \nand religious riots broke out in 1983 and 1984. Shia were exempt from the Zakat tax on the grounds that they would contribute to their own Shi’i ulama for charitable work. But this exemption \"led more and more Pakistanis to declare themselves as Shi’is\" and this phenomenon \"had the effect of hardening anti-Shi’i attitudes among Sunni Islamic activists.\" \nDifferences in fiqh jurisprudence also arose in marriage and divorce, inheritance and wills and imposition of hadd punishments.\n\nZia-ul-Haq pursued anti-Shia policies and attacks on Shias also increased under Zia's presidency, with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to Lahore and Balochistan. Sectarian violence became a recurring feature of the Muharram month every year, with sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias taking place in 1986 in Parachinar. In one notorious incident, the 1988 Gilgit Massacre, Osama bin Laden-led Sunni tribals assaulted, massacred and raped Shia civilians in Gilgit after being inducted by the Pakistan Army to quell a Shia uprising in Gilgit.\n\nAmong Sunni Muslims, Deobandis and Barelvis also had disputes. Zia favored Deobandi doctrine and the Sufi pirs of Sindh (who were Barelvi) joined the anti-Zia Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.\n\nA solid majority of Barelvis had supported the creation of Pakistan, and Barelvi ulama had also issued fatwas in support of the Pakistan Movement during the 1946 elections, but ironically Islamic state politics in Pakistan was mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi) institutions. This was despite the fact that the majority of Deobandi clerics strongly opposed the partition of colonial India and only a few (although influential) Deobandi clerics had supported the Pakistan Movement. Zia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the military and Deobandi institutions.\n\nThe Ahmadiyas, whose members include \"many leading scientists and professionals\", complain that under Zia they have been \"removed from jobs and charge that their property and mosques have been seized\".The Ahmadiyas, among whose members are many leading scientists and professionals, differ from other Moslems in that they do not regard Mohammad as the last prophet. They have been removed from jobs and charge that their property and mosques have been seized under Mr. Zia's regime.\n\nWomen's groups (All Pakistan Women's Association and Women’s Action Forum) opposed the \"Diyat\" Ordinance (which set the \"blood money\" compensation for a women victim at half that for a male), and later the proposed Law of Evidence (which required two women to testify in place of one man). They challenged the law on an Islamic basis, offering an alternative interpretation of the Quranic ayah (verse) used as the basis of the law, emphasising that in other ayat (verses), men and women are assumed to be equal, and noting the importance of the importance of the testimony of two of Muhammad's wives, (Khadija and Aisha) in early Muslim history. (Despite their pious rebuttal, the protesters were met with tear gas and \"lathi\" (baton) charges by police outside the High Court building. Ulama condemned the protest as an act of apostasy.)\n\nInternationally, Human Rights Watch complained that the exclusion of women's testimony in rape cases (from \"Hudood\" Ordinances (1979), as well as the Law of Evidence and proposed laws regarding \"Qisas\" and \"Diyat\", relegated women to \"inferior legal status\" to men.\n\nAnis Ahmad of the International Islamic University credits controversy over the \"fundamentalism\" of Islamisation to the failure of \"Muslim elites\" to understand \"the very nature of divinely revealed law.\" He believes these elites have adopted the \"intellectual culture and political system\" of the British colonizers due to which they have used a \"sociological approach\" to understanding Sharia law,\nand to assert that Islamic punishments such as amputation, stoning and lashing are \"bedouin\", \"tribal\", \"premodern\", \"harsh\", \"outdated\" and \"barbaric.\" He goes on to contend that unlike Sharia, secularism calls for leniency towards the criminal, ignoring the suffering of the victim of crime. He believes that sexual indulgence is not a matter of personal freedom but \"rebellion against the established moral norms in a society\", that application of Sharia to non-Muslims is simply a matter of trying to \"persuade them to act rationally\" and that criticism of the treatment of the Ahmadiyya community has been made based on the Munir Report which has been \"condemned by the \"ulama\" [Islamic scholars] ... as a biased work.\" Ahmad calls for development of educational institutions to include adequate information on current issues so that \"ijtihad\" can be exercised in social, political, economic and legal areas and believes that while Zia and other politicians may be criticized for \"piecemeal and at times frivolous\" implementation, the \"Islamic ideals\" of Islamization have \"the commitment\" of the Muslim people in Pakistan.\n\nIslamization has been harshly criticized. Author Ian Talbot has accused it of appearing \"to have reduced a great faith tradition, rich in humanity, culture and a sense of social justice, to a system of punishments and persecution of minority groups.\" Author Zafar Iqbal Kalanauri suggests that Zia's interpretation of Islam may have \"contributed to the rise of fundamentalism, obscurantism and retrogression\" in Pakistan. Another authority on the topic, Christophe Jaffrelot attributes the rise of Islamic movements including the Lashkar-e-Taiba as an 'unintended consequence of the policy of Islamisation and support for Jihad movements' undertaken by Pakistani authorities since Zia. A blurb for a book of essays on \"The Islamization of Pakistan, 1979-2009\" published by the Middle East Institute, sums up the 30 year impact of Islamisation beginning with Zia as, \"a country’s founding creed violated, much of its resources misspent, and its social fabric rent\". Under Zia stricter Islamic rules did not appear to lead to greater social tranquility. Crime, drinking, drug addiction are thought to have increased.\n\nOthers, at least writing in the 1980s and 1990, thought the impact of the process was overstated. In 1986 New York Times journalist Steven Wiesman wrote that religious and political leaders agreed that Islamisation changes were \"largely marginal or cosmetic.\" Academic Charles H. Kennedy, wrote in the mid 1990s that while during the Zia administration\"hardly a day passed in which one or more of the issues of the program were not the focus of political debate in Pakistan,\" during the Zia administration, the process had relatively small impact, as policies were \"already in place\", \"cosmetic\", or were \"left unimplemented\".\n\nAccording to Zafar Iqbal Kalanauri, the law under Zia is unstable. It has frequently changed or threatened to change because of differences of opinion among the ruling factions. There are inconsistencies\n\nAfter the death of Zia ul-Haq, Benazir Bhutto—the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister he had overthrown and executed—was elected Prime Minister. Although she was an outspoken opponent of Zia's Islamisation, she did not dismantle the Federal Shariat Court, the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court, nor repeal the Hudood and Ramazan Ordinances. She did, however, release all women convict prisoners in Pakistan not convicted of murder (most of whom were in prison because of the Hudood Ordinances), as one of her first acts after assuming power, and generally practiced \"bureaucratic neglect\" of the Islamisation apparatus.\n\nIn October 1990, the Qisas and Diyat \nOrdinance (QDO) was introduced by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.\nIn 1997 during the government of Nawaz Sharif, the Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, now covering all offenses against human body, became an Act of the Parliament. As a consequence, crimes affecting human body in Pakistan are no longer considered offences \"against the society or state\", but \"against an individual\". Thus, if the victim or its family so decide, offenders \"can walk free even after committing\" murder.\n\nIn 1996 the Abolition of Whipping Act (passed by Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party), forbade sentences/punishments of whipping offenders except when imposed as a hadd punishment. \nThis law has \"greatly reduced\" the instances of corporal punishment.\n\nTo lift the restrictions on jurisdiction of Shariat, an \"Enforcement of Sharia Act\" first promulgated by Zia in 1988 but not passed by parliament (and so allowed to expire under Benazir Bhutto), was voted into law by parliament under Nawaz Sharif's government in 1991. The law gave jurisdiction to Sharia-related cases to the Federal Shariat Court, rather than the less Islamically activist-inclined High Courts. But whether the law had more political impact than legal is debated because it kept in place a limited standard of Supremacy of Sharia. The standard of interpretation for superior courts allowed only rulings \"consistent with Islamic principles of jurisprudence\" when \"more than one interpretation\" of the law \"is possible.\"\n\nIn the absence of strong political leadership or social consensus after Zia's passing, Superior courts have been a major, some (Charles Kennedy) say the \"real\" determinant of the \"content and pace of Islamic reform\", through their interpretation of their jurisdiction to consider what laws and actions are \"repugnant to Islam\". Another scholar (Martin Lau) calls Islamisation process in Pakistan largely \"judge-led\".\n\nOne roadblock in the way of striking down laws that activists felt were unIslamic was the lack of supremacy of shariat in the constitution. Activists had tried to use the Objectives Resolution with its principle that \"Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah,\" but the resolution was originally part of the \"preamble\" of the constitution, rather than \"in\" the constitution itself, and as a result a 1973 ruling had declared it to \"not have same status or authority\" as the \"normal written constitution\". In 1985, the constitution was amended and the Objectives Resolution became article 2-A of the \"restored constitution\". With this change, Dr. Tanzil-ur-Rahman—a particularly \"skillful\" Islamic activist and judicial activist—argued that ordering Muslims' lives \"in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah,\" as specified in article 2A was a \"supra-Constitutional\" \"grund norm\" of law in Pakistan. Supporting Tanzil-ur-Rahman interpretation were several decisions handed down in the late 1980s and early 1990s declaring repugnant to Islam such things as the payment of court fees, interest on loans, or investments with a fixed rate of return, the requirement that divorce decrees needed to be recorded by family court to be valid.\n\nThe Supreme Court addressed several important issues pertaining to Islamisation around this time period (during Benazir's time in office), including decisions that found unIslamic provisions in the Pakistan Penal Code pertaining to murder, manslaughter and other forms of bodily hurt, \nand in most of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's land reforms of 1972 and 1977 (ruling for example that Islam does not countenance compulsory redistribution of wealth or land for the purpose of alleviating poverty, however laudable the goal of poverty relief may be.)\n\nHowever bank interest still had not been banned in Pakistan curse to Article 203-B of the constitution (mentioned above) which exempted laws dealing with finance from subordination to the sharia.\nTo remedy this situation Islamic activists strove to convince the public with numerous conferences and copious literature that an interest-free economy as viable and religiously necessary, to pass a bill in parliament making shariat \"superordinate\" to the constitution, and to encourage superior courts to expand their definitions of jurisdiction of shariat.\n\n\nIn 1990, Tanzil-ur-Rehman was appointed to the Federal Sharia Court and about a year later (November 1991) issued a \"monumental decision\" (Faisal vs. Secretary, Ministry of Law) that appeared as though it might put an end to interest-bearing loans and accounts in Pakistan.\n\nThe Faisal decision forbade \"riba\" absolutely without exceptions, overturning 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam. It defined \"riba\" as \"any addition, however slight, over and above the principal\", including any system of markup, any indexing for inflation, payment by value rather than kind. It forbade \"riba\" in \"production loans\" as well as \"consumptive\" loans. It specifically declared invalid two Islamic Modernist interpretations that avoided strict prohibition: considering anti-\"riba\" Quranic verses (2:275-8) allegorical, and use of \"ijtihad\" (independent reasoning) of the issue based on ascertaining the public good (\"maslaha\").\n\nAfter much stalling by the government and bureaucracy, the Faisal case was upheld in 1999 by the Shariah Appellate Bench in the \"Aslam Khaki\" decision, with detailed orders to start the interest free economy. Pleading that implementation of the judgment would \"create enormous problems\" for Pakistan's economy by hurting the domestic western-style banking industry and Pakistan's \"financial dealings with the outside world\", the government was given an additional year by the court to Islamise by the Bench.\n\nBy this time, however, Pervez Musharraf had come to power in a coup and limited the power of the courts. Two justices of the Shariah Appellate Bench resigned rather than take a new oath of office, and a new appeal with new judges found many \"errors\" in the Aslam Khaki case and overturned the ruling of a couple months earlier.\n\nAfter 2001, attention to revise Hudood Ordinance was given by a number of government appointed commissions, a televised several weeks-long-televised debate on the subject In 2006, then President Pervez Musharraf proposed reform of the ordinance, and in November/December the \"Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act\" was passed and signed. The bill retained only Adultery in the Zina Ordinance, allowing rape to be prosecutable under civil law. It prevents unsuccessful complaints of adultery or rape from being converted into charges of fornication, and adds to the Pakistan Penal Code a new offense of false accusation of fornication.\n\nIslamisation has strong public support in Pakistan. According to Shajeel Zaidi, a million people attended Zia ul Haq's funeral because he had given them what they wanted: more religion. A PEW opinion poll found that 84% of Pakistanis favoured making Sharia the official law of the land. According to the 2013 Pew Research Center report, the majority of Pakistani Muslims also support the death penalty for those who leave Islam (62%). In contrast, support for the death penalty for those who leave Islam was only 36% in fellow South Asian Muslim country Bangladesh (which shared heritage with Pakistan).\n\nA poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan during January 2011 of over 2,700 men and women in rural and urban areas of all four provinces of the country, found 67% of Pakistanis responding yes to the question \"In your opinion should government take steps to ‘Islamise’ the society?\" 13% of those polled answered that Pakistan did not need Islamisation and 20% gave no response. In 2016 an opinion poll by PEW found that 78% of Pakistanis said that the country's laws should strictly follow the Quran and a further 16% of Pakistanis said that the laws should follow the values and principles of Islam, but not strictly follow. This was the highest figure amongst all Muslim populations surveyed by PEW.\n\nA 2010 opinion poll by PEW Research Centre also found that 87% of Pakistanis considered themselves 'Muslims first' rather than a member of their nationality. This was the highest figure amongst all Muslim populations surveyed. In contrast only 67% in Jordan, 59% in Egypt, 51% in Turkey, 36% in Indonesia and 71% in Nigeria considered themselves as 'Muslim first' rather than a member of their own nationality.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2153321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153321", "title": "The Software Toolworks", "text": "The Software Toolworks\n\nThe Software Toolworks (commonly abbreviated as Toolworks) was an American software and video game developer based in Novato, California. The company was founded by Walt Bilofsky in 1980 out of his Sherman Oaks garage, which he converted into an office, to develop software for the Heathkit H89 microcomputer. It quickly expanded into video games, releasing \"Airport\" and \"MyChess\" in 1980; other notable games include \"Chessmaster 2000\", \"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing\", and \"Mario Is Missing!\". Toolworks merged with its distributor, Software Country, in 1986 and, after going public in 1988, acquired IntelliCreations, DS Technologies, and Mindscape. By 1994, Toolworks employed 600 people and had a revenue of . In May that year, it was acquired by Pearson plc for , which converted it to bear the Mindscape identity by November.\n\nThe Software Toolworks was founded by programmer Walt Bilofsky, who, after studying at Cornell University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), had worked for the Institute for Defense Analyses, as a programmer for RAND Corporation, and a consultant. In 1979, he acquired and assembled a Heathkit H89 microcomputer; he found that the microcomputer lacked important software and thus began developing new software and ports of his own, including a fullscreen editor and a compiler for the C programming language entitled C/80, the latter based on Ron Cain's public-domain compiler Small-C. Bilofsky subsequently contacted the Heath Company, which made the Heathkit series of microcomputers, to have it market his software and, in response, was told that the operating system and the BASIC programming language Heathkit microcomputers came with were sufficient. He instead turned to advertise his software in \"BUSS\", a Heathkit hobbyist newsletter, starting in 1980, quickly receiving orders for his software. Bilofsky eventually adopted the name \"The Software Toolworks\", using it publicly for the first time with an advertisement submitted to the magazine \"Byte\" in June 1980. He converted his garage in Sherman Oaks, California, in a two-room office, outfitting it with disk duplicator, shelving, and a shipping area. This office was later relocated into a garden shed. By the end of the year, Toolworks had entered the video game business, having published \"Airport\", an air traffic control game by Jim Gillogly, and \"MyChess\", a chess game by Dave Kittinger. This continued in 1981, with Robert Wesson developing a clone of \"Pac-Man\", the game \"Munchkin\", and a port of \"Invaders\" for the H89, and Bilofksy adapting the artificial intelligence psychiatrist ELIZA. Other early non-game software included the spreadsheet editor Zencalc (later replaced by MyCalc), the text editor PIE, the text formatting application TEXT, and the spelling checker SPELL.\n\nOne of Toolworks' major releases was a port of \"Adventure\", a text adventure game developed by William Crowther in 1975 and later expanded by Don Woods. Gillogly made Bilofsky aware of the game and, by 1982, was able to get the game running on an H89 using Bilofsky's C/80 compiler. Although the game was in the public domain, Bilofsky decided to release an official version with the approval of Crowther and Woods. This version was expanded so that, at the end of the game, the player is admitted into a fictional \"Wizards' Guild\" and given a password that could be posted to Toolworks in return for a \"Certificate of Wizardness\", underwritten by Crowther and Woods, and signed with the Toolworks corporate seal, the only time this seal was used. The game was released in 1982 and came with a manual packaged in a Ziploc bag.\n\nIn 1983, Toolworks was joined by Joe Abrams, Bilofsky's cousin. That same year, the company moved into a proper, three-room office on the 11th floor of a Sherman Oaks bank building, opposite of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. This move was made possible by Toolworks' growing sales, and by this time, its products were sold through more than 50 Heathkit stores, and it had released a total of 40 products by 1984. That year, distributor Software Country and its manager, Les Crane, licensed Toolworks' versions of \"Adventure\" and ELIZA for a software compilation disk titled Golden Oldies Vol I, which was released the following year. Subsequently, Crane agreed with Abrams that Software Country would market a chess game developed by Toolworks; for this project, Toolworks brought on Mike Duffy, who had ported \"MyChess\" to IBM PC and PCjr, and the team developed \"Chessmaster 2000\". Crane stepped up the marketing efforts for the game, paying for the cover photo. Bilofsky described this change as the \"emphatic end of the Ziploc bag era\". \"Chessmaster 2000\" was released in 1986 and sold 100,000 copies within seven months. Building from this success, Toolworks and Software Country merged in October 1986, with Toolworks as the surviving entity. The merged company then bought Priority Software Packaging, a disk duplication and software packaging company, the following November.\n\nFollowing the merger, Crane conceived a typing application in which the user would be guided by Mavis Beacon, a fictional typing instructor who would correct the user's mistakes. The product, \"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing\", was developed by Bilofsky, Duffy and Norman Worthington from Bilofsky's home in six months, with Duffy often working more than 140 hours per week. The team aimed at making the application more fun to keep users engaged, thus it incorporated large quantities of text it deemed interesting, generated mistake analyses, and made it visually appealing. Renée L'Espérance, a Haitian woman whom Crane and Abrams had met at a Saks Fifth Avenue store, was contracted to represent Mavis Beacon. Due to her darker skin, several stores initially refused to sell the application when it was released in 1987. This changed when a positive review of the application published in \"The New York Times\" generated much demand, restoring all of Toolworks' usual distribution channels within two weeks.\n\nIn February 1987, Toolworks signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts (expanded for distribution in Europe in July), which required Toolworks to port each new game to Apple II, Apple III, Apple IIGS, Macintosh, PCjr, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amiga and IBM PC computers, of which in colored and monochrome versions for the latter. Each team member at the company was tasked with developing one of the ports but the undertaking eventually proved a financial strain and Toolworks ran out of funds by the end of 1987. To raise new capital, the company became a public company in January 1988, through a reverse merger with Deseret-Western Venture Capital, an existing public shell corporation registered in Utah. By June 1988, Toolworks had 45 employees. Shortly thereafter, the company acquired developers IntelliCreations (of Chatsworth, California) in August 1988 and DS Technologies (of West Chicago, Illinois) in February 1989. With the acquisition of IntelliCreations, Toolworks announced that it would move its headquarters to Chatsworth. Toolworks also agreed with manufacturer Vendex to have Toolworks' games included with Vendex's machines. By 1989, \"Chessmaster\" games and \"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing\" had collectively sold 750,000 through retail and licensing deals. Looking to get a hold of a development license for Nintendo platforms, which were difficult to obtain, Toolworks acquired Mindscape, an existing license holder based in Northbrook, Illinois, in March 1990. Using Mindscape's license, Toolworks released a follow-up to \"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing\" focused on piano teaching: \"Miracle Piano Teaching System\". The application came with a physical pressure-sensitive keyboard, which Toolworks had ordered 100,000 of. The required quantity was overestimated and many keyboards were damaged in transit, causing high financial losses for Toolworks. In April 1990, Elizabeth Barker became the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Toolworks, succeeding Crane (who remained chairman and chief executive officer) in the president role, and was succeeded herself in both roles by Robert Lloyd in November 1990. In September 1990, Toolworks moved from Chatsworth to Novato.\n\nWhile in talks with Japanese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in Japan, the chief executive officer of Philips introduced Abrams to CD-ROM drives; CD-ROM discs could store high capacities of data but drives for them were uncommon in households at the time. Developer LucasArts had completed three CD-ROM games but struggled to sell them. In 1992, Toolworks licensed the games from LucasArts and had them distributed with new PCs by the Japanese OEMs. Within one month, this led to more sales of these games than LucasArts had achieved in the two years prior. Toolworks continued to grow further, to 600 employees by 1994, when it was generating annual revenues of . That May, the company was acquired by British media company Pearson plc for . Shortly thereafter, by November, Toolworks had assumed the Mindscape moniker for all of its operations, which is considered the end of Toolworks.\n"}

{"id": "2153346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153346", "title": "Brigittenau", "text": "Brigittenau\n\nBrigittenau () is the 20th district of Vienna (). It is located north of the central districts, north of Leopoldstadt on the same island area between the Danube and the Danube Canal. Brigittenau is a heavily populated urban area with many residential buildings.\n\nThe district's name comes from the Brigitta Chapel, built between 1645 and 1651.\n\nIt consists of a good tract of land secured by the regulation of the Danube 1870–75, and many of the major streets are named after members of the Danube Regulation Commission. Therefore, it does not contain any distinctive historical areas. Brigittenau was separated from the 2nd district in 1900. Earlier component districts were named \"Schottenau\", \"Wolfsau\", \"Taborau\", and \"Zwischenbrücken\".\n\nThe best-known landmark is the Millennium Tower. The district also includes Adolf Hitler's former residence in Vienna, the Meldemannstraße dormitory.\n\nThe Brigittenau district is located on the north end of an old, wide island between the Danube Canal and Danube in the northeast of Vienna's city center area. The district is northwest of the thin \"Donauinsel\" (\"Danube Island\"), across on the northeast side of the Danube. The average height of the district area is 162.4 m above sea level. The area was originally called \"Unterer Werd\" (Werd = island in a stream, i.e. lower island in the stream). Through the regulation of the Danube, the character of the district area significantly changed. The floodplain and Donaualtarme stocks gradually disappeared. The Brigittenau district covers an area of , or 1.4% of the Vienna area. This puts Brigittenau in the lower middle of the Vienna municipal districts. Due to its location, about 21% of the area is on water, the second highest value in Vienna. While green space is below average, the proportion in the traffic areas is among the highest. In the south, the Brigittenau district borders the 2nd district, Leopoldstadt.\n\nThe Brigittenau district lies on the western edge of the Vienna Basin. The deeper background of the Vienna Basin is the Brigittenau from flysch rocks. With the demolition of the Vienna Basin, this is a layer on top Brigittenauer only in height, however, in Zwischenbrücken in depth. During the medium Miocene (Badener layer) the pool broke and deposited in power less freshwater sediments (sands and conglomerates). From the East the sea stored clay marl, sand and algae, whose thickness increases to the east. In the Sarmatian (upper Miocene) by the performance of the oceans a brackish fauna emerged and clay marl was deposited. Also, this layer has increasing thickness from west to east. Today, this layer on the Brigittenauer Spitz lies below the surface, at Zwischenbrücken . In the Pannonium, the increasingly silting-up freshwater lake deposited tegel. The territory of Brigittenau is covered with quaternary deposits, the thickness from . The bottom layers consist mostly of gravel with sand and layers of gravel. In the area between Heiligenstadt bridge, Franz-Josef railway station, Augarten and the freight station, these layers are covered with loam, fine sand and loess-like deposits. The rubble deposits stem from the erosion processes during the ice ages (in the Pleistocene) thad deposited large quantities. In this sections, the Danube cut wide terraces, where Brigittenau is in the \"zone of recent meanderings\", which forms the postglacial part of the terrace of the Prater. Alternating floods and ongoing relocations of the Danube bed, together with the formation of new rubble banks led to a low thickness of only . Above the rubble deposits are gray and brown floodplain soils.\n\nThe developed area of Brigittenau comprises 38.7% (Vienna citywide 33.32%) of the district area. The proportion of housing in the developed area amounts to 64.2%, plus 21.2% for operations, and 10.7% dedicated for facilities in the cultural, religious, sports or the public sector. Greenspace in Brigittenau takes in only 7.9%, for which Brigittenau lies in the lower third of the Vienna municipal districts. About 66% of green space is in parks, 22.3% in sport and leisure areas, with the remainder in small gardens and meadows. Due to the large shares of the area for the Danube Canal and Danube, waters take 20.9% of the total district territory. This is the second highest value of a district. The proportion of trafficked area in the district, with 32.9%, is the fourth highest value in Vienna.\nBrigittenau to the west is bordered by the Danube Canal, which separates it from the district of Döbling, in the northwest, and from Alsergrund, in the southwest. The district boundary runs along the right bank, making the surface water of the Danube canal count towards Brigittenau. In the east, the left bank of the Danube River (at Danube Island) is the border with district Floridsdorf. Also here, the water area of the Danube counts toward Brigittenau. Southeast of the Brigittenauer Bridge, take the district boundaries of Brigittenau, Floridsdorf, the Danube, and Leopoldstadt together, with the southern boundary forming the northern border of Leopoldstadt. This border runs across the Danube, and then along the line Innstraße - Dresdner Straße - Nordbahnstraße - Taborstraße - Northwest Bahnstrasse - Rauscherstraße (wall of Augartens) - Wasnergasse (wall of Augartens) and Perinetgasse on the Danube Canal.\n\nBrigittenau consists of two formerly separate communities, as the eponymous Brigittenau and Zwischenbrücken. Zwischenbrücken, however, is divided between Leopoldstadt and Brigittenau. The southern part of Zwischenbrücken is now in Leopoldstadt; the eastern part fell victim to the Danube regulation.\n\nBrigittenau received nearly of the municipal district of the like-named \"Katastralgemeinde\".\nOnly the water area of the Danube belongs to three other \"Katastralgemeinden\"; the largest part lies in the Floridsdorf district. There are in Donaufeld, in Floridsdorf and in Schwarzen Lackenau.\n\nA further breakdown of the district area is in the census-districts of official statistics, in which the municipality counts are combined. The eight census-districts (\"Zählbezirke\") in Brigittenau are: Kapaunplatz, Zwischenbrücken, Brigittaplatz, Lorenz Müller-Gasse, Wallensteinstraße, Wextraße, Höchstädtplatz und Nordwestbahnhof.\n\nThe first known settlers of this area were from the House of Babenberg, in the 11th century. In 1096, the area had been extended by Leopold III to the monastery he founded St. Mary Nivenburg (today Klosterneuburg Monastery). The owners often changed because the place was often given away, sold or leased.\n\nIn the 13th century, the area was first documented in a chronicle. The Viennese denoted the area as \"Werd\" (island). The first settlers in this area were fishermen, hunters and lumbermen. Later, also gardeners and farmers settled there.\n\n1463/64: The Schlagbrücke (today's Sweden Bridge, \"Schwedenbrücke\") was built. This was the first permanent bridge over the still unregulated inner-city branch of the Danube.\n\n1529: The first Turkish siege of Vienna - there was heavy fighting in the area of the Danube islands.\n\n1536 to 1540: Building grounds were given away to citizens that lost their homes during the Turkish siege.\n\n1618–1648: Thirty Years War: On 9 April 1645, the Swedish army under Lennart Torstenson won the Wolf's Lair (\"Wolfsschanze\"). Imperial troops conquered back the area in a four-day battle. Thus the Brigitta sage came into being, which the current Brigittakapelle remembers.\n\n1670: The first written mention is made of \"Brigittenau\". The previous names were: \"Im Werd\", \"Schottenau\" and \"Wolfsau\".\n\n1683: Second Turkish siege of Vienna - During heavy fightings in the Wolf's Lair and near the current Friedensbrücke, the Brigittakapelle is destroyed.\n\n1688-1698: Tabor bridge is built. A new road passing \"Zwischen den Brücken\" is created, therefore the Wolfsbrücke bridge is relocated further downstream.\n\n1695: The Brigittakapelle is rebuilt.\n\n1732: A pheasantry is erected by the Hof- und Landjägeramt. 1796: Near the Tabor bridge, the Johann Nepomuk chapel is built.\n\n1810: In Brigittenau, the first hand-craft businesses settles, such as a Kunstblecherei, a steam sawmill and a fire-syringe factory.\n\n1828: The Colosseum, an entertainment facility, is built.\n\n1830: There is a devastating ice floe and a great flood from the Danube.\n\n1834: Construction of the \"Universum\" (today's Universe Street), another venue.\n\n1838: The Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway opens, in 1837 as the first steam train of the Empire of Austria (including Hungary at that time) on the leg Floridsdorf - Deutsch-Wagram, one year later crossing the Danube to the North Station at Praterstern.\n\n1840: The first rail-bound train horses drive along what is nowadays the Jägerstraße of old Tabor to the \"Colosseum\".\n\n1846: Clearing of the remaining riparian forests, erection of nurseries (Vorgartenstraße) in the north of the district.\n\n1848: The Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire also influence Vienna. Robert Blum, member of the Frankfurt Parliament and born in Cologne travels to Vienna for supporting the democratic movement. After the abolition of the Vienna Uprising, he was executed by the Austrian imperial army in the \"Brigittawaldl\".\n\n1850: The Brigittenau area, between the Danube Canal and Danube, was incorporated as Leopoldstadt in the city of Vienna. It was the 2nd district of Vienna.\n\n1862: A major flood occurs, the final impetus to the Vienna Danube regulation starting in 1870.\n\n1867: Construction of the Brigittakirche church starts.\n\n1870 Construction on the Danube regulation as well as the construction of the Northwest station at the site of the former \"Universums\", near the present Tabor.\n\n1871: The Northwest Railway Bridge and the \"Brigittabrücke\" (now Peace Bridge) were built.\n\n1873: North rail bridge (\"Nordbahnbrücke\") is built; construction of the Northwest station ended.\n\n1874: Inauguration of Brigittakirche and the Kaiser-Franz-Joseph Bridge over the new stream bed (since 1875 water-bearing) of the Danube (today Floridsdorfer Bridge).\n\n1875: The New Danube bed is ready.

The route into today's 21st district leads through Jägerstraße, Stromstraße and Marchfeldstraße and over the Kaiser Franz Joseph Bridge.\n\n1897 The first electric tram in Vienna. The \"Transversallinie\" (today line 5) connects the Vienna head stations of North, Northwest, Franz Joseph and Western Railway. Coming from the 2nd district, it heads along the Augarten (Rauscherstraße) and Wallenstein Street, then on the Brigittabrücke (today's Peace Bridge, \"Friedensbrücke\") into the 9th district. At the junction of the Danube Canal from the Danube's main stream, since 1873 a floating barrier (Schwimmtor) regulated the water inflow if needed. In 1894-98, Otto Wagner instead built the Nussdorf weir and lock.\n\n1900: On 24 March 1900, in the era of mayor Karl Lueger, at the request of Brigittenauer politicians Brigittenau is separated from Leopoldstadt. The council declares Brigittenau to be the 20th Viennese district. This remains until 1904 the highest district number.\n\n1906: The Amtshaus on the Brigittaplatz opens.\n\n1906: On 7 July, Anton Karas is born in the house at Leystraße 46. He becomes famous because in 1948 he played the zither theme for Harry Lime in the film \"The Third Man\".\n\n1907: The service station (in Vienna also known as Remise) in the Wexstraße for the then tram lines 3, 34 and V is opened.\n\n1910: The steam tram to is replaced by the electric tram (\"Straßenbahn\") line 31.\n\n1912: The reconstruction of Emperor Franz Joseph Bridge, now called Floridsdorfer bridge, started. The bridge was opened not earlier than 1922, after the end of the First World War.\n\n1913: In the hall of the northwest station, , a social-democratic member of the Imperial Council Reichsratsabgeordnete, is murdered by Paul Kunschak (brother of the Christian social politician Leopold Kunschak).\n1914: Establishment of Sascha-Film by Count Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky, first producing in Brigittenau, Treustraße 76.\n\nA private association founds a hospital in the 20th Viennese district is at Stromstraße 34, the so-called \"Brigitta-Spital\".\n\n1924: Opening of the community residential complex \"Winarsky-Court\" (\"Winarsky-Hof\"); in its planning in 1921, well-known architects like Adolf Loos and Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky are involved.\n\n1924-1926: Replacement of old Brigittabrücke on the Danube Canal by the new Peace Bridge (\"Friedensbrücke\").\n\n1926: Establishment of the emergency hospital in the Webergasse, under the direction of Dr. Lorenz Böhler.\n\n1929: Huge ice floe on the Danube.\n\n1932: The large municipal residential complex at the Friedrich-Engels-Platz (at Floridsdorfer Bridge) is completed (begun 1930).\n\n1938: Anschluss. Terror against Jewish Viennese, with expulsion and mass murder begins. The school Karajangasse becomes the first concentration camp (\"Sammellager\"). In the hall of the northwest station (\"Nordwestbahnhof\"), the Nazi exhibition Degenerate Art (\"NS-Ausstellung Entartete Kunst\") takes place.\n\n1943: Construction of flak towers in Augarten (2nd district, just on the border of Brigittenau).\n\n16 July 1944: First American bombing at Vienna causes severe damage to Brigittenau.\n\nApril 1945: Heavy bomb damage to Bezirksamt, Brigittakirche, Leyschule and many other buildings, total destruction of the All Saints Church (\"Allerheiligenkirche\"). The Floridsdorfer Bridge is blown up by retreating German troops. When conquered, Vienna is divided into four sectors, Brigittenau belonging to the Soviet Union.\n\n1946: On 19 May, the Floridsdorfer Bridge is reopened as Malinowsky Bridge (\"Malinowskybrücke\", in honor of Soviet Marshal Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky, the commander of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, who conquered Vienna). Since 1956, the bridge is again called Floridsdorfer Bridge. The Döblinger and the Peace Bridge (\"Friedensbrücke\") are reconstructed.\n\n1952: Removal of the destroyed Northwest station hall.\n\n1962: New Vienna fast-rail with the stop Traisengasse, on the north track through Brigittenau. Later, the stop Handelskai was added.\n1964: Opening of the Belt Bridge (\"Gürtelbrücke\") over the Danube canal.\n\n1972: Opening of the new Lorenz-Boehler emergency hospital in Donaueschingenstraße.\n\n1977: Opening the new building of the (accident insurance).\n\n1978: Opening of the newly established Floridsdorfer Bridge, next to the old dilapidated one, that is removed afterwards.\n\n1979: Construction of TGM () in the Wexstrasse, a Höhere Technische Lehranstalt.\n\n1982: Opening of the 7th Vienna Danube bridge, the Brigittenauer Bridge, between the bridges Nordbahnbrücke and Reichsbrücke.\n\n1996: Opening of the subway line U6, between the Vienna Beltway by Brigittenau and Floridsdorf. At the edge of the district there are the stations Jägerstraße, Dresdner Street and Handelskai. Also in 1996, the border changed at Döbling, in the field of Nußdorfer lands on the Danube Canal. By this, Brigittenau lost a waterside area west of the Danube Canal to Döbling, and received in return the northern tip of Brigittenau, which formerly belonged to Döbling.\n\n1999: Opening of the Millennium Tower, the second tallest building in Vienna.\n\nIn 1869, the present area comprising Brigittenau, as part of the then Leopoldstadt, had only 15,922 inhabitants. After the completion of the Danube regulation in 1875, the number of inhabitants grew strongly by the addition of new mining areas from the 1880s. In the 1880s and 1890s, Brigittenau was the fastest growing sub-district of Vienna, and in 1910, the district reached a peak of 101,326 residents. After the First World War, the population of Brigittenau gradually, in particular the increased housing demand played a role. Until the '80s, the population and marked 1991, a low of 71,876 district residents. Then the influx of population began to grow again, with the population in early 2007 as 82,121 people. Brigittenau is one of the most densely populated districts of Vienna.\n\nThe age structure of the district population in 2005 was slightly younger than the average for Vienna citywide. The number of children under 15 years was 14.9%, slightly higher than the total average for Vienna (14.6%). The proportion of the population from 15 to 59 years was 64.7% (Vienna: 63.4%), above average, while the proportion of people aged 60 or more years, with 20.5% (Vienna: 22.0%) was lower. The gender distribution in the district area, in 2001, was 48.6% men and 51.4% women. The number of married people had a share of 41.0%, compared with citywide 41.2%, slightly below the average of Vienna.\n\nThe proportion of foreign district residents in 2005 was 26.2% for Brigittenau (Vienna citywide: 18.7%). This was the third highest value of a district of Vienna. As in the entire state, the foreign population growth, to 2001, the figure was at 24.1%. The highest proportion of foreigners, in 2005, was represented by approximately 7.0% share of the district population as nationals from Serbia and Montenegro. Another 5.4% were Turkish, Polish 1.6%, or 1.4% each for Bosnian and Croatian citizens. In 2001, a total of 31.0% of the district population was born outside of Austria. Nearly 9.4% expressed as a language Serbian, Turkish 9.3% and 3.3% Croatian.\n\nDue to the high proportion of foreigners, Brigittenau with 42.4%, was one of the lowest populations of people with Roman Catholic faith (Vienna citywide: 49.2%). There are four district Roman Catholic parishes, which includes 20 city Deanery. The proportion of people with Islamic faith, at 14.1%, is the second highest value in Vienna. Also, the percentage of Eastern Orthodox believers was 8.4%, much higher than the average. The proportion of Protestant residents stood at 3.1% below the average. Nearly 24.7% of the district population, in 2001, were not included in a religious community. Another 7.4% had no religion or another preference stated.\n\nThe SPÖ has always been the strongest party in Brigittenau. In 1996, the SPÖ's absolute majority was broken by heavy losses to the FPÖ. With 31.1% of the vote, the FPÖ reached their third highest result in Vienna. In the 2001 election, the SPÖ reclaimed the absolute majority, due to a general FPÖ downturn. This downturn continued in 2005, when the FPÖ reached only 16.6% of the vote, a 15% decline since 1996. \nBrigittenau has however been a battle district between the fronts of FPÖ and SPÖ.\nThe next time things moved was in 2010 when the SPÖ was decreased 8.5% and lost their absolute majority reaching 47.8% now\nand the FPÖ increased 11.3% up to now 27.9%.\nThe Green Party reached 12.0% of the votes and stagnated.\nThe ÖVP traditionally only plays a small role in Brigittenau and even fall down to 8.5% (the first time in history they were below the 10% in Brigittenau) only being 4th strongest party in the 2010 elections. \nAnd the newly founded BZÖ reached 1.0% in the 2010 elections.\n\nThe coat of arms, for Brigittenau consists of 2 sections. The upper section shows the crest of the earlier, separate community of Brigittenau. It has a silver anchor on a blue background, symbolizing the ship travels on the Danube and Danube Canal. Below that is the symbol for the earlier community of Zwischenbrücken. It shows a red tongue on a silver background, surrounded by a golden halo, with 5 gold stars. The coat of arms symbolizes, at the same time, the holy Johann Nepomuk, the patron of the bridges and also stands for that originally laid zone between the Danube and the Kaiserwasser.\n\n\n\nThe district controls a single museum. The district museum of Brigittenau dedicates itself the district story that is represented by plans, pictures, views and models. Thereto the story of the Danube, as well as special displays, are presented. Focal points of the museum are, among other things, the history of business and industry, transport and communications, everyday life and society life, and the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.\n\nOver 40 percent of the Brigittenau land area is in traffic zones. The green area share amounts to, on the other hand, only about ten percent.\nAbove all the container-terminals Nordwestbahnhof and Knoten Nußdorf are most noticeable, due to the enormous area requirement. The traffic load is very high because the most important traffic arteries that cross the Danube pass through the district. The next bridge over the Danube upstream is 50 km (30 mi) away in Tulln. Moreover, 86 percent of all Brigittenauers employed do not work in the district.\n\n\n\n\n Official web site (in German)\n"}

It is framed between two sere hills and divided by the San Jose River that runs during the summer season. It is located three kilometers from the city of Arica. This jewel of the north has a unique climate that permits the farming of a great variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the year. This is in addition to the unique Azapa olives, renowned for their violet color and bitter flavor that also gives birth to a hearty oil.\n\nSome of the world's oldest mummies from the Chinchorro culture are in the Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa in Arica. Many ruins of the Chiribaya culture (900 to 1400 CE) are in the Azapa Valley.\n\nOne of Azapa's more interesting places is the hometown of artisan Jose Raul Naranjo Meneses, the Andean resort town of Parinacota, a town full of craftsmen. From Halles Street to passages around the Manuel Castillo Ibaceta roundhouse, one may find a diverse array of crafts available to tourists (and crafted on-site) of stone sculpture and wood, archaeological reproductions, ocarinas, archaeological ceramics from the north of Chile, designs on fabric, weavings, seaweed, utilitarian and decorative ceramics, as well as crafts and sculptures in metals.\n\nAlso, a regionally famous restaurant, \"the Inn\", offers typical Chilean meals as well as international cuisine. It is open Monday through Sunday, 9:30am to 1:30pm (closed for siesta!)and 3:30pm to 8:00pm. The rest of the region offers other attractions, such as Chuño Hill, a place of many petroglyphs, and the Gorge of Acha, with its geoglyphs and their prehistoric camps.\n\nAnother location, the Cerro Sombrero (Hat Hill) boasts geoglyphs and a pre-Hispanic village perched on the side of the hill and made up of wood dwellings surmounting natural stone terraces. Historical studies have indicated that this establishment had as many as 500 houses between 1000 and 1400 A.D., a significant era of regional developments within Arica culture. The occupants of these constructs were agriculturists who maintained a substantial commercial exchange with Andean highland people. This commerce took place by means of llama caravans, which brought products of the highlands such as charqui, quínoa, wool, etc., down into the lowlands. This merchandise was traded for the products made by the populations of the low, coastal valleys: maize, red pepper, fish and seafood. Atoca, figures made of stone, represent a typical caravan of llamas with their guide, preceded by two dancers with anthropomorphous characteristics, and depict scenes of the caravan traffic that was carried out between coastal peoples and the peoples of the highlands.\n\nAmong sacred hills in the region of Pampas Alto Ramirez are impressive geoglyphs and other artifacts memorialize diverse settlements from the beginnings of agriculture to the present time. The panel of geoglyphs corresponds to the time of Inca regional influence and development (1,000 - 1,400 AD) and human and animal figures of the area: camelidaes, serpents, lizards, etc.\n\nType of grave in the form of little hills (túmulos) through the successive accumulation of layers of sand and vegetal fiber litter.\n\nThis town is located about 12  km from Arica and is surrounded by beautiful agricultural environs; it survives as a breeding ground of subtropical plants, túmulos and features the Archaeological Museum of San Miguel de Azapa, a museum associated with the Universidad de Tarapacá. This museum presents a complete vision of the cultural and anthropological development of the region for the past 10,000 years. Chinchorro mummies are exhibited in the museum. A visit here allows knowing some of the histories of this corner of the world.\n\nLocated approximately 80  km from Arica, it is the scene of the celebration of the Virgin of the Rosary of Las Peñas (The Rocks), a celebration which happens between the first Sunday of October and December 8 of every year.

{"id": "2153358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153358", "title": "Abu Hurairah", "text": "Abu Hurairah\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Ad-Dausi (‎; 603–681), better known as Abu Hurairah, was one of the sahabah (companions) of Muhammad and, according to Sunni Islam, the most prolific narrator of hadith. He was known by the \"kunyah\" Abu Hurayrah \"Father of a Kitten\", in reference to his attachment to cats, and he was a member of Ashab al-Suffa. It is unclear as to what his real name is, the most popular opinion being that it was ‘Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr (). Abu Hurayrah spent 2 years 3 months approximately in the company of Muhammad and went on expeditions and journeys with him. He is credited with narrating at least 5374 Ahadith.\n\nAbu Hurayrah was from the Arab tribe of Banu Daws and was born in the region of Bani Daws which was in Asir at that time. His father had died, leaving him with only his mother and no other relatives.\n\nHis name is disputed among Muslim scholars. His name is said to be \"Abd al-Rahman Ibn Sakhr\",\"Abul Rahman Ibn Ghnam\", abd al rehman ibn e yaqub\"Abd Ibn Ghnam\", \"abd Nahm Ibn 'Amir\", \"Abd Shams Ibn 'Amir\", \"'Omir Ibn 'Amir\", \"Abd Shams Ibn Sakhr\", \"'Amir Ibn Abd Ghnam\", \"Sikin Ibn Mal\", \"Sikin Ibn Hana'\", \"'Amr Ibn Abd Shams\", \"Amr Ibd Abd Nihm\", \"Sikin Ibn Jabir\", \"Yazid Ibn 'Ashrqah\", \"Abdullah Ibn 'Aith\", \"Sikin Ibn Wathmah\", \"Borir Ibn 'Ashraqah\" or \"Saeed Ibn Al-Haryth\". His birth name is also disputed among Muslim scholars, his birth name is said to be \"Abd Shams\", \"Abdallah\", \"Sikin\", \"'Amir\", \"Borir\", \"Amr\", \"Saeed\", \"Abd Amr\", \"Abd Ghnam\", \"Abd Yalil\" or \"Abd Tim\".\n\nAbu Hurairah embraced Islam through Tufayl ibn Amr, the chieftain of his tribe. Tufayl had returned to his village after meeting Muhammad and become a Muslim in the early years of his mission. Abu Hurairah was one of the first to respond to his call, unlike the majority of Tufayl's tribesmen, who embraced Islam later. Abu Hurairah accompanied Tufayl to Mecca to meet Muhammad who renamed him Abd al-Rahman (\"servant of the Merciful\"). Abu Hurairah then returned to his tribe to live for many years.\n\nHe was present during the Expedition of Dhat al-Riqa‘. Some scholars claim, the expedition took place in the Najd, a large area of tableland in the Arabian Peninsula in Rabi‘ II or Jumada al-awwal, 4 AH (or the beginning of 5 AH). They substantiate their claim by saying that it was strategically necessary to carry out this campaign in order to quell the rebellious bedouins in order to meet the exigencies of the agreed upon encounter with the polytheists, i.e. minor Badr Battle in Sha‘ban, 4 A.H. Muhammed received the news that certain tribes of the Ghatafan were assembling at Dhat al-Riqa‘ with suspicious purposes.\n\nMuhammad proceeded towards Najd at the head of 400 or 700 men. In his absence, he mandated the affairs of Medina to Abu Dhar al-Ghifari (or according to Umayyad tradition, Uthman ibn Affan). The Muslim fighters penetrated deep into their land until they reached a spot called Nakhla, where they came across some bedouins of Ghatfan.\n\nHowever, the opinion according to Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri in his \"The Sealed Nectar\", is that the Dhat ar-Riqa‘ campaign took place after the fall of Khaybar and not as part of the invasion of the Najd. This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurayrah and Abu Musa al-Ash'ari witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari came back from Abyssinia and joined Muhammad at Khaybar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear which Muhammad observed at Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign, were revealed at the Invasion of the 'Asfan and this, scholars say, took place after the Battle of the Trench.\n\nFollowing the death of Muhammad, Abu Hurayrah spent the rest of his life teaching hadith in Medina, except for a short period as governor of Eastern Arabia (then called \"Bahrayn\") during the reign of Umar, and when he was the governor of Medina during the early Umayyad Caliphate. Abu Hurayrah died in 681CE (59AH) at the age of 78 and was buried at al-Baqi'.\n\nAccording to the Richard Gottheil and Hartwig Hirschfeld, Abu Hurairah was one of the close disciples of Ka'ab al-Ahbar.\n\nAlthough credited with over 5000 hadith, Al-Bukhari's biography of the Prophet Muhammad noted that Abu Hurairah was a minor companion and a late convert to Islam who only spent approximately 2 years and 3 months in the company of the Prophet. In contrast to Hurairah, Prophet Muhammad's closest companions are credited with far less hadith; Abu Bakr is credited with 142 hadith, Uthman ibn Affan with 146, Umar ibn Khattab with 537, and Ali ibn Abi Talib with no more than 586 hadith. This discrepancy between attributed hadith and Abu Hurairah's minor role and limited time with the Prophet has been called into question by a number of scholars who argue that Abu Hurairah's accounts are unreliable sources of hadith. Scholar Abdullah Saeed on this occasion points out that Umar bin Khattab, during his tenure as a caliph, threatened Abu Hurairah on a number of occasions with banishment due to his frequent misquoting of the Prophet's words. During his lifetime, Abu Hurairah was noted as a blatant self-promoter who often made up hadith based on his limited interaction with the prophet. However, later jurists had often taken Abu Hurairah's word seriously and frequently used them uncritically in later rulings. \n"}

The original location was the east side of the North Platte River near the river bridge south of U.S. Highway 30. The first hangar and terminal buildings were built there. The airport was the site of the first night airmail flight, on February 22, 1921. The field was lit using burning fuel barrels and the plane landed at 7:48 p.m. and left for Omaha at 10:44 p.m. after repairs to the de Havilland 4.\n\nIn 1929 the City of North Platte bought the airfield and leased it to the Boeing Transport Company, an original part of United Airlines. More construction was done in 1941 and the site became the site of a B-17 training command.

On September 5, 1942 Scottsbluff was selected as one of seven satellite air bases in Nebraska. Twenty-eight farms were vacated so construction could begin at a cost of $5.5 million. The original Scottsbluff Municipal Airport closed to make way for the new airfield; the old airport later became a prisoner of war camp.\n\nConstruction began on September 7, 1942. A temporary railroad spur was constructed and some of concrete for three runways was poured in forty-five days. There were about 108 buildings on the ground including barracks, mess halls, officers' quarters, warehouses, a hangar, a camouflage instruction building, and a bombsight storage building.\n\nThe base was occupied as early as 11 October 1942 and was assigned to Second Air Force. Initially, Scottsbluff Army Airfield was a satellite to Casper Army Air Field, Wyoming. The first troops arrived December 4, 1942. The 4190th Army Air Force Base Unit was the host organization at Scottsbluff AAF.\n\nThe original mission was to train crews of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators bombers. Crews based at Casper AAF Wyoming final training at Scottsbluff. All training aircraft at the airfield were assigned to the 4190th AAFBU.\n\nIn 1944 base command was transferred from Second Air Force to the 1st Troop Carrier Command, and became a satellite field of Alliance Army Airfield. The 1st TCC used the facility training Douglas C-47 Skytrain and glider crews. Aircraft and radio maintenance personnel also trained here.\n\nThe airfield closed on December 31, 1945 and the War Department handed over control to the City of Scottsbluff in 1947. Buildings and structures which were not part of the transfer were sold by the U.S. Government in separate agreements and most were removed. The USAF continued to use the airport for training until 1950.\n\nWestern Airlines DC-3s were at Scottsbluff by 1945 and United appeared in 1953-54; both left in 1959, replaced by Frontier, which remained until 1984.\n\nIn July 1970 Scotts Bluff County took control and has had it since.

{"id": "2153442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153442", "title": "Minneapolis hardcore", "text": "Minneapolis hardcore\n\nMinneapolis hardcore is a form of hardcore punk that has evolved since the mid-1970s. Minneapolis-St. Paul featured a lively music scene in the 1960s and 1970s that included an established tradition of local indie labels and live music venues. The Litter were one of the protopunk bands to emerge from the scene in 1966. Their heavily distorted guitar amplifiers played a high volumes became the \"signature sound\" for many punk bands that emerged much later. A punk rock scene started to coalesce in the mid-late 1970s around Jay's Longhorn Bar and Oar Folkjokeopus record store. The first recognized punk rock band from Minnesota was the Suicide Commandos, who formed in 1975. Their first 7\" EP was released in 1976. They released another 7\" EP in 1977 before recording their LP later that year on \"Blank Records\", a sub-label of Mercury Records.\n\nAlong with Boston, New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Chicago, Minneapolis was a preeminent scene for punk rock in the early/mid-1980s. Early venues included Jay's The Longhorn Bar, which hosted the Suicide Commandos and touring acts, including The Plasmatics, and the Police on their first US tour.\n\nGoofy's/The Upper Deck, which was located above a strip club just off of Hennepin Avenue, was a major spot for early hardcore and presented popular all-ages shows, as well as Duffys, which hosted early shows by Flipper, Black Flag, The Nig Heist, Circle Jerks, Willful Neglect, Discharge, Nina Hagen, The Meat Puppets, Minutemen and many other bands and radical artists who rose to a level of international fame in the following decades. \n\nFirst Avenue and 7th Street Entry also hosted all-ages shows for the young scene which quickly established itself on the map with local bands including Hüsker Dü, the Replacements, Final Conflict, Loud Fast Rules (later Soul Asylum), Otto's Chemical Lounge, Outcry, Skullfuck, Ground Zero, Idol Threat, Exmo 6-Desmo, The No-Dicks, Rifle Sport, The Warheads, Man Sized Action, and Red Meat, Timbuktu, and rare &th St Entry appearances by punk \"all-star\" bands such as The Velvet Fruit Tree, The Used Toilet Papers (Bob Mould, Grant Hart, Don \"The Baptist\" Holzschuh, of the Warheads, and Tom \"Tippy\" Roth ,Guitarist of Man-Sized Action, and The Noble Mice, among others.\n\nThe legendary punk zine \"Your Flesh\" by Ron Clark and Peter Davis was based in Minneapolis, as was \"Urban Decay\". Zinester Saint Vitus holds heavy sway from the era and area.\n\nIndependent record stores supporting the local punk scene include the original Northern Lights records on Hennepin Ave, Treehouse Records (formerly Oarfolkjokeopus) in south Minneapolis and Cheapo Records in St Paul.\n\nThe early to mid-1980s Minneapolis hardcore movement included both U.K sound-inspired leather punks and a large skate punk contingent, with Uptown Minneapolis as the heart. Both scenes hosted many garage shows for local and touring bands. The skate punks congregated at The Alternative Bike Shop (The Alt) in Uptown. The UK influenced punks earned the nickname McPunks for hanging around the Uptown McDonald's bus stop. The Minneapolis bus system, immortalized by the Replacements pop-punk song \"Kiss Me on the Bus\", was the artery connecting punks from Minneapolis Southwest High School and St. Paul with a ride to 7th Street Entry and Northern Lights Music.\n\nSome of the bands from the early to late 1980s era were Final Conflict, not the California band of the same name, Skullfuck, Willful Neglect, Misery, Iron Fist and Outcry. Final Conflict released one 7\" EP \"In the Family\" on local Reflex Records. Reflex was run by Terry Katzman, then manager of Oar Folkjokeopus and also released records by Hüsker Dü, Articles of Faith and two compilation tapes \"Kitten\" and \"Barefoot and Pregnant\". Skullfuck recorded a demo, \n\nbut no copies survived. Willful Neglect from St. Paul released two 12\" EPs on Neglected Records that were re-issued on CD; Wade Calhoon & James Wallin (of Willful Neglect) recorded their \"Made in the Shade\" album released in November of 2014. \nRed Meat was another hardcore band that released only a demo tape \"Island of the Dogg\". later, some of the tracks by Red Meat re-surfaced on the \"Lung Cookies\" compilation LP. Outcry released 1 lp and 1 7\"EP and were influential among the straight edge and skate punk crowds.\n\nIn 1987 Blocked Out was formed out of Minnetonka, MN. With singer Greg Anderson, guitarists Chris Pierre and Keith Pichelman, bassist Steve Erickson and drummer Jim Alden. They were very influential in the suburban punk scene. Only released an EP on tape before breaking up in 1991.\n\nOn Oct 2nd 1987 Punk icon and legend GG Allin played a show backed by Mpls band The Fuckin' Shit Biscuits in the 7th St. Entry. This was the only show that GG Allin ever played in Mpls.\n\nIn September of 1983, the strip bar/hardcore punk venue Goofy's Upper Deck was permanently shut down by the city after \"a certifiable riot\" causing upwards of $4,500 in damages. Midway through Minneapolis band Final Conflict's set, the electricity was shut off by the bars owners and chaos ensued. Mike Etoll maestro of the offbeat absurdist comedy punk combo Exmo 6-Desmo pulled a toilet from the women's restroom floor then threw it through a plate glass window sending it crashing to the sidewalk two floors below. A large homemade smoke bomb was ignited, filling the bar with thick yellow smoke. The liquor was stolen from the bar by, as some witnessed, the owners of the club. This theft was eventually blamed on the crowd in attendance, many of whom were underage. Soon a passel of MPD officers appeared on the scene with pepper spray, and began indiscriminately beating people with their batons. one arrest, and one excessive-force complaint later, Goofy's Upper Deck was no more. The loss of Goofy's Upper Deck was the first blow to the visible Mpls punk scene. After a violent Black Flag show in 1985, stage diving was banned at First Avenue. Three years later the decline of the bar-venue Mpls punk scene progressed rapidly. With the breakup of Hüsker Dü, the once public Mpls hardcore/punk scene moved underground. The slam dancing, stage diving, skate punk crew that drove the small mid-80s Positive hardcore scene evolved into rap and metal, and Queercore electronica. Mpls UK punks began booking independent house shows in place of performing in commercial venues. During this period of change more conservative bands emerged creating a more sanitized, commercial and professional environment with the intention of making major label record deals. this schism caused greater demarcation between the commercial and non-commercial bands within the ever-evolving punk/hardcore scene (Incidentally, the Mpls Goth-Metal and Darksider scene never died, feeding off of the strong Christian/Pagan Scandinavian roots of the Midwest, joining forces in content and spirit with the 90's Early Norwegian Black Metal scene.)\n\nAs the punk scene moved deeper underground, a homegrown Midwest rock ethic coalesced into what would become known as alt-country. Minneapolis became a leading alt-country scene led by the Jayhawks, with supporting musicians out of the old post-punk scene playing for Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, etc. In fact, Wilco played their first shows at 7th Street entry.\n\nThe late 80s saw the more commercially viable bands and musicians, such as Paul Westerburg of The Replacements, and Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü follow the hardcore trend away from punk, towards a more expansive and mainstream hard rock/pop sound. Around this time bands like the Cows, Halo of Flies, and Babes in Toyland developed a sound that re-established Minneapolis punk originality, blending a dark attitude with droning noise and distorted rock. Local label Amphetamine Reptile arose to publish the new style.\n\nIn the early 1990s the 7th St. Entry hosted regular hardcore matinees featuring new bands with divergent styles.\n\nThe band Misery provided a nucleus for what became an internationally envied crust punk scene in Minneapolis. Taking their influence from UK bands such as Discharge and Amebix, Misery blended dark and heavy hardcore with an influential anti-authority political stand, encouraging the political punk and DIY scene in the area, which started to flourish. \n\nThe Scrods from Roseville, friends of Misery, toured the Midwest area and released a 7\" single called \"Voyage into Hell\", a humorous, but scathing, socio-commentary on the poor quality of communications between local metal and hardcore scenes.\n\nBlind Approach from St. Paul championed the new style of Straight Edge hardcore popularized by New York bands like Warzone. They released two 7\"s and toured the USA. Guitarist Matt Henderson went on to join Agnostic Front.\n\nThe Libido Boyz from Mankato, MN played melodic and poppy hardcore punk and released several 7\"s and LP and did some extensive touring.\n\nCock E.S.P. was and is one of the more outlandish and original bands that is rooted in the hardcore & gutter punk school of music. Although this extreme metal noise and art enigma does not use the conventional structure of the western musical construct, it embodies the spirit of All-Star Wrestling, Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan and the chaotic heart, sonic assault, and serious live on stage injuries in the zest and zeal of some of the oldest and most notorious, violent, and stupid punk outfits.\n\nHardcore fractured into several subgenres with sometimes competing political, ideological and artistic viewpoints. Profane Existence Collective formed in 1989 and released records, produced a fanzine and booked shows. THD started as a radio show, but also was a house doing some basement shows and had a record label. The Sonic Warp Collective took up booking all-ages shows for a while after First Avenue stepped back from doing all-ages punk shows.\nIn 1994 a group of local punks and hardcore kids (including Dan and Mandy of Profane Existence, Felix of Havoc Record and Jason of THD, among others) got together to open Extreme Noise Records, a long-running DIY co-op punk record store. The new store provided a center for the scene. A new DIY venue opened as the Studio of the Stars and hosted many shows during the summer of 1995.\n\nSome former Minneapolis hardcore musicians made careers with other bands, such as Todd Trainer of Rifle Sport, now in Shellac. Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü had a long solo career. Dustin from the Libido Boyz was in Snapcase for many years.\n\nIn 1999 Twin Cities Skins and Punks (TCSP) formally formed and began helping promote local TC bands in the DIY scene and set up all-ages shows. Their goal, as posted on their site, is to make DIY hardcore accessible to as many fans as possible while maintaining the punk ethic of being against \"The Man\". – \"\"This was and continues to be the all ages DIY punk rock scene, defined as a participatory subculture controlled by those who comprise it: the punks... We believe that packaged tours with no ties to the local punk community utilizing outsider booking agencies without sharing the stage with local acts ..., thereby fostering local growth, reduce their music to a mere product and represent the very antithesis of punk. TCSP banned together to combat these forces, keep influence over the scene in the hands of people with a vested interest in the music and movement and provide a positive and inclusive alternative to the impersonal herding of the club scene.\"\"\n\n\n\nThe Minneapolis hardcore and punk scene has a strong DIY ethic. Accomplishments have included community-sponsored venues to basement shows to an all-volunteer independent record store Extreme Noise Records.\n\nNeglected Records\n\n"}

Denver Air Connection now offers scheduled passenger flights to Denver, which are subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"general aviation\" facility (the \"commercial service\" category requires 2,500 enplanements per year).\n\nAlliance Municipal Airport was built during World War II by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) It was one of eleven USAAF training airfields in Nebraska during World War II. On April 14, 1942, the Secretary of War authorized the establishment of the field. It was built between summer 1942 and August 1943. The site is bordered by low rolling sandhills to the east, and a wide plain on the north, west and south. Snake Creek flows through the southern section of the property.\n\nDuring construction over 5,000 workers came from all over the country, causing a housing shortage. The population of Alliance doubled almost overnight. Workers moved into garages, store rooms, cellars, attics, and even their own trailers in established parks. Many of the workers were Sioux Indians from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations, Mexicans from the Southwest, and blacks from Wichita and Kansas City.\n\nThe cantonment housing area of the airfield covered , and had 775 buildings and other structures, including hangars, chapels, warehouses, barracks, mess halls, service buildings, and latrines. Some were brick and steel, such as aircraft hangars, but most were frame construction on concrete foundations. Tar paper and plywood were generally used for walls and flooring, as the buildings were considered temporary, to be used for a few years. The airfield had a railroad spur, power plant, waterworks, sewage system and of runways. The airfield had been planned as a training facility for paratroops and air commandos, which needed long runways for C-47 Skytrains to tow gliders.\n\nOn August 22, 1943, a huge crowd of 65,000 people gathered for the dedication of Alliance Army Airfield, a training facility for Army paratroops and air crews. Between the opening of the airfield and spring 1944, the I Troop Carrier Command, 434th Troop Carrier Group commanded the airfield. The 411th Army Air Force Base Unit commanded the support elements at Alliance as part of Air Technical Service Command. In addition to the C-47s, the unit repaired B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator aircraft from other airfields.\n\nAlliance AAF was divided into air operations, quartermaster, troop cantonment, and gunnery ranges. The airfield was home to as many as 14,000 paratroops in the area, using C-47 Skytrains as powered troop carriers, and CG-3/CG-4 Waco glider troop carriers for their training aircraft. The sandhills were thought to provide a softer landing than wooded areas for jumping paratroops. Known units that trained at Alliance AAF were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the USAAF units, the Army 326th Glider Infantry, 507th Parachute Infantry, and 878th Airborne Engineers trained at Alliance before deployment to the European Theater.\n\nAs paratroopers flooded into Alliance, housing was short. A federal housing project was built at the east end of Alliance, apartment complexes with plain stucco walls, coal heating stoves, and rows of chimneys along the rooflines, thus the name \"Chimney Town.\"\n\nAfter the paratroops left Alliance, Second Air Force temporarily used the Alliance airfield in the fall of 1944 for the training of B-29 Superfortress crews. Training included teaching the B-29 air crews how to drop bombs and read navigational, aeronautical and bombsight equipment.\n\nFinally, in the summer of 1945, the 1st Troop Carrier Command returned to the airfield to train for the proposed invasion of Japan. That necessity ended when Japan surrendered on September 6. On October 31, 1945, the Army Air Force \"temporarily\" deactivated the Alliance Army Airfield. Control of the airfield was assigned to Air Technical Service Command at Ogden Army Airbase, Utah.\n\nThough speculation was that the Army would make the huge Alliance airfield a permanent installation, by November 20 the Troop Carrier Command closed the facility permanently and began to make plans to sell the surplus property.\n\nBy December 1945 the facility was declared surplus property. Nonetheless, its status remained in limbo. The city of Alliance showed interest in acquiring the facility. However, in the fall of 1946 Nebraska congressman Arthur L. Miller stated that the airfield would be withdrawn from the surplus list to be reactivated for Troop Carrier Command training, in response to strained relations with the Soviet Union. This did not happen and the U. S. Government negotiated a disposition agreement for the facility.\n\nDue to disputes between the U.S. government and the city of Alliance, the final disposition of the airfield did not occur for many years. The government removed the railroad tracks and auctioned off 240 buildings, including lavatories, guard houses and barracks.

Antenna reflectors can exist as a standalone device for redirecting radio frequency (RF) energy, or can be integrated as part of an antenna assembly.\n\nThe function of a standalone reflector is to redirect electro-magnetic (EM) energy, generally in the radio wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nCommon standalone reflector types are\n\nWhen integrated into an antenna assembly, the reflector serves to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna, increasing gain in a given direction.\n\nCommon integrated reflector types are\n\nParameters that can directly influence the performance of an antenna with integrated reflector:\n\nThe antenna efficiency is measured in terms of its effectiveness ratio.\n\nAny gain-degrading factors which raise side lobes have a two-fold effect, in that they contribute to system noise temperature in addition to reducing gain. Aperture blockage and deviation of reflector surface (from the designed \"ideal\") are two important cases. Aperture blockage is normally due to shadowing by feed, subreflector and/or support members. Deviations in reflector surfaces cause non-uniform aperture distributions, resulting in reduced gains.\n\nThe standard symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector system is very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic sub-reflector and its supporting struts (usually 3–4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when the size of the parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.\nTo avoid blockage from the sub-reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor cross-polar response, etc.\n\nTo avoid spillover from the effects of over-illumination of the main reflector surface and diffraction, a microwave absorber is sometimes employed. This lossy material helps prevent excessive side-lobe levels radiating from edge effects and over-illumination. Note that in the case of a front-fed Cassegrain the feed horn and feeder (usually waveguide) need to be covered with an edge absorber in addition to the circumference of the main paraboloid.\n\nMeasurements are made on reflector antennas to establish important performance indicators such as the gain and sidelobe levels. For this purpose the measurements must be made at a distance at which the beam is fully formed. A distance of four Rayleigh distances is commonly adopted as the minimum distance at which measurements can be made, unless specialized techniques are used (see \"Antenna measurement\").\n\n"}

It is the second arcade game based on the \"Tenchi wo Kurau\" manga, following \"Dynasty Wars\". Originally released to arcades in 1992, home versions of the Sega Saturn and PlayStation were released in 1996. A version for mobile phones followed in 2005. Capcom later included an emulated version of the arcade original as part of the \"Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle\" released digitally for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows on September 18, 2018.\n\n\"Warriors of Fate\" is a beat'em up with nine stages. Each contains large mobs including spearman, archers, strongmen, bomb-wielding opponents, and at least one Wei boss. There can be up to three players on-screen at the same time. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day. Common enemies including Wei soldiers such as bandits, privateers, wrestlers, fatties and thieves will keep popping up from everywhere. In the end of each stage there is a Wei general as stage bosses, e.g., Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Cao Ren, Xu Huang, and the infamous Lu Bu as the final boss. After defeating them all, there is also Cao Cao himself who would try to escape. The game also has two bonus stages that require rapid pressing of buttons.\n\nThere is also a variety of weapons in the game which can be picked up. As with most side-scrollers, food is used to replenish health and can be found in various breakable containers in the game levels. One notable feature of the game is the ability to summon a warhorse which adds more attacks to the characters, generally involving pole-arms (except the long bow for Huang Zhong). Each character except Zhao Yun was given a special wrestling throw of their own. Unlike the first game, \"Dynasty Wars\", Liu Bei is not playable. The playable characters are Zhang Fei, Guan Yu, Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, four of the famous Five Tiger Generals, and Wei Yan (in the US version, they are named Portor, Kassar, Subutai, Kadan, and Abaka respectively).\n\nIn the Japanese version, \"Tenchi wo Kurau II\" follows Liu Bei's plight in Jingzhou from the \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", a history-based novel from China, set in the Three Kingdoms period as Cao Cao sets to invade his lands after the death of Dong Zhuo and recruiting his general Lu Bu to his army. In \"Warriors of Fate\", Shu Han, led by Liu Bei, as in the novel, was everything \"good\" and \"righteous\", while Wei, led by the ever-suspicious and cunning Cao Cao, is portrayed as \"evil\" and \"bad\". Liu Bei's warriors begin by fighting Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Bowang, then Battle of Changban, then finally join up with Sun Quan to fight at the Battle of Red Cliff. If the Five Tigers slay Cao Cao, Wu and Shu join forces, unite Wei, return the Han back to rule and restore peace, if not Cao Cao escapes and history continues as intended with the land in turmoil and the eventual demise of Shu.\n\nIn the English adaptation, however, the Three Kingdoms theme was lost, and most names have been changed to names of Mongolian origin. The story takes place in a fictional realm where the evil overlord Akkila-Orkhan (originally Cao Cao) of Shang-Lo tries to conquer his neighbouring countries, converting them into ruin and despair. Kuan-Ti (originally Liu Bei), with the aid of the five great warriors, stands up against the conquering shadow and fights to defend his people and lands.\n\nThere is a fighting game variation of this game for Sega Genesis called Tenchi wo Kurau III: Sangoku Gaiden (Chinese Fighter III).\n"}

The term is of uncertain etymology and is only attributed from the early 19th century.\n\nYokels are depicted as straightforward, simple, naive, and easily deceived, failing to see through false pretenses. They are also depicted as talking about bucolic topics like cows, sheep, goats, wheat, alfalfa, fields, crops, tractors, and buxom wenches to the exclusion of all else. Broadly, they are portrayed as unaware of or uninterested in the world outside their own surroundings.\n\nIn the United States, the term is used to describe someone living in rural areas. Synonyms for yokel include \"bubba\", \"country bumpkin\", \"hayseed\", \"chawbacon\", \"rube\", \"redneck\", \"hillbilly\", and \"hick\".\n\nIn the UK, yokels are traditionally depicted as wearing the old West Country/farmhand's dress of straw hat and white smock, chewing or sucking a piece of straw and carrying a pitchfork or rake, listening to \"Scrumpy and Western\" music. Yokels are portrayed as living in rural areas of Britain such as the West Country, East Anglia, the Yorkshire Dales and Wales. British yokels speak with country dialects from various parts of Britain.\n\nThe development of television brought many previously isolated communities into mainstream British culture in the 1950s and 1960s. The Internet continues this integration, further eroding the town/country divide. In the 21st century British country people are less frequently seen as yokels. In the British TV Show \"The Two Ronnies\", it was asserted that despite political correctness, it is possible to poke fun at yokels as no-one sees themselves as being one.\n\n\nIn Scotland, those from the Highlands and Islands, Moray, Aberdeenshire, and other rural areas are often referred to by urban or lowland Scots as teuchters.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" the term is a \"by-form\" of the personal name Richard (like Dick) and Hob (like Bob) for Robert. Although the English word \"hick\" is of recent vintage, distinctions between urban and rural dwellers are ancient.\n\nAccording to a popular etymology, hick derives from the nickname \"Old Hickory\" for Andrew Jackson, one of the first Presidents of the United States to come from rural hard-scrabble roots. This nickname suggested that Jackson was tough and enduring like an old Hickory tree. Jackson was particularly admired by the residents of remote and mountainous areas of the United States, people who would come to be known as \"hicks.\"\n\nAnother explanation of the term hick describes a time when hickory nut flour was used and sold. Tough times, such as the depression, led to the use of hickory nuts as an alternative to traditional grains. People who harvested, processed, or sold hickory products, such as hickory flour, were referred to as \"hicks\". The term was generalized over time to include people who lived in rural areas and were not considered as sophisticated as their urban counterparts.\n\nThough not a term explicitly denoting lower class, some argue that the term degrades impoverished rural people and that \"hicks\" continue as one of the few groups that can be ridiculed and stereotyped with impunity. In \"The Redneck Manifesto,\" Jim Goad argues that this stereotype has largely served to blind the general population to the economic exploitation of rural areas, specifically in Appalachia, the South, and parts of the Midwest.\n\n\n"}

In addition to the several campuses scattered in the city of Nantes, there are two satellite campuses located respectively in Saint-Nazaire and La Roche-sur-Yon. Currently, the University is attended by approximately 34,500 students. More than 10% of them are international students coming from 110 countries.\n\nThe University of Nantes was ranked between 401-500th in the Times Higher Education of 2016. On a national scale and regarding the professional insertion after graduation, the University of Nantes oscillates between the ranks 3rd and 40th out of 69 universities depending on the field of studies. Among its noticeable alumni are French Agriculture minister and Government spokesperson Stéphane Le Foll and the former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.\n\nThe current University was founded in 1970 under the terms of the 1968 law which reformed French higher education. This newly established institution replaced the former University of Nantes which had been founded in the early 1960s. This itself was a re-establishment of the original University of Nantes which was established by papal bull in 1460 but was abolished during the French Revolution.\n\nThe university of Brittany is found by Bertrand Milon on April 4, 1460, at the initiative of the duke François II of Brittany under the form of a papal bull of the Pope Pie II given to Sienne. This embodies the wish of François II to affirm his independence towards the French king, while near the duchy in Angers in 1432, Poitier in 1432 and Bordeaux in 1441, some universities are created. Found under the structure of a studium generale, this university can teach all traditional disciplines: Arts, Theology, Law and Medecin. The number of students between the end of the 15th century and during the two following centuries reach a thousand or 1500, according to the highest estimates.\n\nThe first attempt to move the university of Nantes to Rennes takes place at the end of the 16th century. French king, Henry IV wants to punish Nantes, a ligueuse ville pour its support of the duke of Mercoeur. The university receives an order from the king by a letter of August 8, 1589 to move to Rennes, a city remains loyal to the monarchy. The institution is however not moved because of financial issue. A new letter of September 5, 1591 from the king reiterate the order of transfer, but again without application. On April 1598, a last king's letter stabilise the situation by confirming the establishment of the university in Nantes.\n\nSince 2004, the University has followed the LMD European system that divides the post-secondary education in 3 degrees: the Licence( equivalent of a Bachelor's degree), the Master and the Doctorat (PhD). Each course provides credits according to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) developed by the European Commission and a certain number of credits will allow a student to obtain their degree. For instance, the first post-secondary education degree, the Licence, can be obtained with 180 ECTS accumulated within 3 years. A full year gives 60 ECTS while a semester gives 30 ECTS.\n\n\nThe University offers the students to practice more than 50 different sports, whether it is for competitive or recreational purposes. The University also provides adapted training to athlete students and participates in national and international competitions in the following disciplines: athletics, rowing, badminton, French boxing, soccer, hockey, judo, swimming and sailing.\nIn 2011, the University was one of the first French universities to create a quidditch team.\n\nApproximately 3,500 places on residence are available each year. These places are distributed by the CROUS on a social status basis taking into account the yearly income of the student's parents or legal representative, the number of siblings remaining under the parents' responsibility and the distance between the University and the student's place of residence.\n\nThere are two types of residences: \n\nThe CROUS from Nantes manages the different student restaurants on campus as well as the meals they offer. Most of the restaurants are open for lunch and dinner from Monday to Friday and offer a complete meal at a price regulated on a yearly basis. For the academic year of 2013-2014, the price of a meal was set at €3.30 .\n\n\n\n\nThe University currently has partnerships with 397 institutions in 60 different countries worldwide. The majority of these partnerships are located in Europe. Each year, more than 1,000 students go abroad to study in one of those partner institutions for one or two semesters. The university receives each year students from its partner universities in exchange for welcoming the students from Nantes. The existing partnerships are ruled according to different international conventions such Erasmus (Europe), ISEP and CREPUQ (Quebec).\n\nExchange students are still registered in the University of Nantes and transfer the credits they gained in their host university. Conversely, the international students who came on exchange in Nantes will receive their credits in their home university.\n\nThere were 4,210 international students registered in the University of Nantes for the year 2018.\n\n\n"}

Trailed behind the airship, it consisted of a single element, one half wavelength long radiator with a quarter wave parallel feedline tuning stub. This concept evolved to the J configuration by 1936 attaining the name \"J Antenna\" by 1943. When the radiating half-wave section is mounted horizontally, at right-angles to the quarter-wave matching stub, the variation is typically called a \"Zepp\" antenna.\n\nThe J-pole antenna is an end-fed omnidirectional half-wave antenna that is matched to the feedline by a quarter wave parallel transmission line stub of Lecher system form. Matching to the feed-line is achieved by sliding the connection of the feedline back and forth along the stub until an impedance match is obtained. Being a half-wave antenna, it provides a small gain over a quarter-wave ground-plane antenna.\n\nPrimarily a dipole, the J-pole antenna exhibits a mostly circular pattern in the H plane with an average free-space gain near 2.2 dBi (0.1 dBd). Measurements and simulation confirm the quarter-wave stub modifies the circular H-plane pattern shape increasing the gain slightly on the side of the J stub element and reducing the gain slightly on the side opposite the J stub element. At right angles to the J-stub, the gain is closer to the overall average: about 2.2 dBi (0.1 dBd). The slight increase over a dipole's 2.15 dBi (0 dBd) gain represents the small contribution to the pattern made by the current imbalance on the matching section. The pattern in the E plane reveals a slight elevation of the pattern in the direction of the J element while the pattern opposite the J element is mostly broadside. The net effect of the perturbation caused by quarter-wave stub is an H-plane approximate gain from 1.5 to 2.6 dBi (-0.6 dBd to 0.5 dBd).\n\nLike all antennas, the J-pole is sensitive to electrically conductive objects in its induction fields (aka reactive near-field region ) and should maintain sufficient separation to minimize these near field interactions as part of typical system installation considerations. The quarter wave parallel transmission line stub has an external electromagnetic field with strength and size proportional to the spacing between the parallel conductors. The parallel conductors must be kept free of moisture, snow, ice and should be kept away from other conductors including downspouts, metal window frames, flashing, etc. by a distance of two to three times the spacing between the parallel stub conductors. The J-Pole is very sensitive to conductive support structures and will achieve best performance with no electrical bonding between antenna conductors and the mounting structure.\n\nTypical construction materials include metal tubing, ladder line, or twin-lead.\n\nThe J-pole antenna and its variations may be fed with balanced line. A coax feed line may be used if it includes a means to suppress feed-line RF currents. The feed-point of the J-pole is somewhere between the closed low-impedance bottom and open high-impedance top of the J stub. Between these two extremes a match to any impedance between the low to high impedance points is available.\n\nThe J-pole design functions well when fed with a balanced feed (via balun, transformer or choke) and no electrical connection exists between its conductors and surrounding supports. Historical documentation of the J antenna suggests the lower end of the matching stub is at zero potential with respect to earth and can connect to a grounding wire or mast with no effect on the antenna's operation. Later research confirms the tendency of the mast or grounding wire to draw current from the antenna potentially spoiling the antenna pattern. A common approach extends the conductor below the bottom of the J-pole resulting in additional and undesirable RF currents flowing over every part of the mounting structure. This modifies the far field antenna pattern typically, but not always, raising the primary lobes above the horizon reducing antenna effectiveness for terrestrial service. J-pole antennas with electrical connection to their supports often fare no better, and often much worse, than the simpler Monopole antenna. A mast decoupling stub reduces mast currents.\n\nA variation of the J-pole is the Slim Jim antenna, also known as 2BCX Slim Jim, that is related to the J-pole the way a folded dipole is related to a dipole. The Slim Jim is one of many ways to form a J-Pole. Introduced by Fred Judd (G2BCX) in 1978, the name was derived from its slim construction and the J type matching stub (J Integrated Matching).\n\nThe Slim Jim variation of the J-pole antenna has characteristics and performance similar to a simple or folded Half-wave antenna and identical to the conventional J-pole construction. Judd found the Slim Jim produces a lower takeoff angle and better electrical performance than a wavelength ground plane antenna. Slim Jim antennas made from ladder transmission line use the existing parallel conductor for the folded dipole element. In the copper pipe variation, the Slim Jim uses more materials for no performance benefit. Slim Jim antennas have no performance advantage over the conventional J-pole antenna.\n\nThe approximate gain in the H-plane of the Slim Jim is from 1.5 to 2.6 dBi (-0.6 dBd to 0.5 dBd).\n\nThe Super-J variation of the J-pole antenna adds another collinear half-wave radiator above the conventional J and connects the two with a phase stub to ensure both vertical half-wave sections radiate in current phase. The phasing stub between the two half-wave sections is often of the Franklin style.\n\nThe Super-J antenna compresses the vertical beamwidth and has more gain than the conventional J-pole design. Both radiating sections have insufficient separation to realize the maximum benefits of collinear arrays, resulting in slightly less than the optimal 3 dB over a conventional J-pole or halfwave antenna.\n\nThe approximate gain in the H-plane of the Super-J antenna is from 4.6 to 5.2 dBi (2.4 dBd to 3.1 dBd).\n\nThe collinear J antenna improves the Super-J by separating the two radiating half-wave sections to optimize gain using a phasing coil. The resulting gain is closer to the optimum 3 dB over a conventional J-pole or halfwave antenna.\n\nThe approximate gain in the H-plane of the Collinear J antenna is from 4.6 to 5.2 dBi (2.4 dBd to 3.1 dBd).\n\nThe graph compares the E-plane gain of the above three variations to the conventional J antenna.\n\nThe conventional J antenna and SlimJIM variation are nearly identical in gain and pattern. The Super-J reveals the benefit of properly phasing and orienting a second radiator above the first. The Collinear J shows slightly higher performance over the Super-J.\n\nThe basic J antenna resonates on the third harmonic of its lowest design frequency. Operating a 3/2 wavelengths this way produces an antenna pattern unfavorable for terrestrial operation.\n\nTo address the pattern change a variety of techniques exist to allegedly constrain a J antenna operating at or near the third harmonic so only one half-wave is active in the radiator above the stub. All involve the use of a high impedance choke at the first voltage loop. These methods fall short of the goal as choking a high impedance point with a high impedance allows energy to pass the choke.\n"}

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nDuring World War II the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces by Air Technical Service Command as a maintenance and supply depot. It was also used by Sioux Falls Army Air Field as an auxiliary airfield for Second Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress bomber training.\n\nPierre's first airline flights were around 1935, on Watertown Airways; this was at the old airport north of town at . Inland Airlines and successor Western Airlines served the present airport from about 1938 until 1984; in the 1950s Pierre was one of six stops on a Minneapolis-Los Angeles Convair 240 flight.\n\nNorth Central Airlines Douglas DC-3s arrived in 1959, flying Minneapolis/Saint Paul - Watertown, SD - Aberdeen, SD - Pierre - Rapid City - Spearfish, SD. Convair 340s, Convair 440s and Convair 580s followed.\n\nThe first jets were North Central McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s in 1968. During the 1970s Western Boeing 737-200s flew nonstop to Rapid City and Sioux Falls with direct, no change of plane service to Denver, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles while North Central DC-9s flew nonstop to Aberdeen and Rapid City with direct service to Minneapolis/St. Paul while North Central still flew Convair 580 turboprops to Pierre as well.\n\nIn 1979 North Central merged with Southern Airways to form Republic Airlines which had four departures a day at Pierre flown with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50s and Convair 580s. Republic pulled out of Pierre in 1981, and mainline air service ended when Western left in 1984.\n\nIn 1981 Northern Airlines turboprops flew to Minneapolis/St. Paul, Rapid City, Sioux Falls and other cities. In 1984 Mesaba Airlines turboprops flew Minneapolis/Saint Paul - Sioux Falls - Pierre - Rapid City.\nIn fall 1994 three commuter airlines served the airport: Great Lakes Airlines (United Express), Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) and AirVantage Airlines, an independent carrier. Great Lakes Beechcraft 1900s flew nonstop to Denver and direct to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, and Mesaba Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner flew nonstop to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, and AirVantage Metroliners flew nonstop to Bismarck, ND, Rapid City and Sioux Falls.\nIn summer 1999 Great Lakes Airlines (United Express) Beech 1900s flew to Denver and other cities. Great Lakes lost its designation as a United Express carrier but continues to serve Pierre.\n\nUntil June 30, 2006 Great Lakes Airlines flights to Denver were subsidized by the Essential Air Service (EAS) program. The U.S. Department of Transportation selected Big Sky Airlines to provide service beginning July 1, 2006, but that order was suspended when Great Lakes decided to continue service without the EAS subsidy.\n\nIn 2007 Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) Saab 340s flew direct to Minneapolis/Saint Paul via Watertown, and Great Lakes flew Beechcraft 1900s nonstop to Denver as an independent airline. After the merger of Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines in 2010, Delta Connection Saab 340s flew Minneapolis to Pierre. When Delta quit using the Saab 340 in December 2011, and announced it was leaving Pierre, flights from Minneapolis used Delta's Canadair Regional Jet 200 until Delta pulled out on January 31, 2012.\n\nMore recently Great Lakes Airlines 19-seat (later 9-seat) Beechcraft 1900Ds to Minneapolis/St. Paul and Denver have been the only airline flights at Pierre. Great Lakes Airlines flew via interline agreements with Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines and United Airlines.\n\nPierre Regional Airport covers 1,834 acres (742 ha) at an elevation of 1,744 feet (532 m). It has two asphalt runways: 7/25 is 6,881 by 150 feet (2,097 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 6,900 by 100 feet (2,103 x 30 m).\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 32,140 aircraft operations, average 88 per day: 78% general aviation, 11% airline, 11% air taxi and <1% military. 98 aircraft were then based at the airport: 71% single-engine, 28% multi-engine and 1% helicopter.\n\nA new terminal had been needed for many years, as the old terminal building was plagued by a number of problems, primarily space constraints. Construction on the new terminal began in late Spring, 2011 and completed in September, 2012.\nDenver-based Coover-Clark & Associates, Inc. designed the building and Kadrmas Lee & Jackson's Rapid City office handled the construction administration. Initially, a jet bridge was to be installed at the terminal, but airport officials decided to wait until a scheduled commercial airline could use the jet bridge, as Great Lakes Airlines aircraft serving the airport at the time were not jet bridge capable. Officials also waited because Pierre had been without scheduled passenger jet service operated with mainline aircraft for over 30 years. The new terminal building was designed with the space set aside for a loading bridge, so it required very little effort to install one when the time came.\n\nWith the introduction of jet service by Aerodynamics, Inc. in 2016, the city began considering a jet bridge for the airport. In August 2017, the Pierre city commission awarded the job of making and installing a new jet-boarding bridge to Sharpe of Pierre for its bid of $716,500. The new jet bridge was installed at the airport on April 23, 2018. A federal grant covered nearly all the costs, with the state kicking in 5% and the city 5%, or about $45,000.\n\nAir service to Pierre resumed on April 3, 2019, with daily flights to Denver and continuation service to Watertown. Service is provided by SkyWest Airlines, operating via the United Express brand on behalf of United Airlines using a 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet 200. This service is subsidized with annual funding of $3.64 million (or $49.84 per seat) from the Essential Air Service program, currently scheduled to end April 30, 2021.\n\nFedEx Feeder is operated at the field by CSA Air.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2153559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153559", "title": "Rail transport in Japan", "text": "Rail transport in Japan\n\nRail transport in Japan is a major means of passenger transport, especially for mass and high-speed travel between major cities and for commuter transport in urban areas. It is used relatively little for freight transport, accounting for just 0.84% of goods movement. The privatised network is highly efficient, requiring few subsidies and running extremely punctually.\n\nRail transport services in Japan are provided by more than 100 private companies, including\n\nMany of the private rail companies rank among the top corporations in the country. Railways were built by private corporations developing integrated communities along the railway lines, allowing them to achieve profitability by diversifying into real estate, retail, and numerous other businesses. Regional governments, and companies funded jointly by regional governments and private companies, also provide rail service.\n\nThere are 30,625 km of rail crisscrossing the country. JR (a group of companies formed after privatization of JNR) controlled 20,135 km of these lines as of March 31, 1996, with the remaining 7,133 km in the hands of private enterprise local railway companies. Japan's railways carried 9.147 billion passengers (260 billion passenger-kilometres) in the year 2013-14. In comparison, Germany has over 40,000 km of railways, but carries only 2.2 billion passengers per year. Because of the massive use of its railway system, Japan is home to 46 of the world's 50 busiest stations.\n\nThe major usage is of urban and intercity lines, and around the time of the privatisation of JNR, many unprofitable local and rural lines were closed, especially in Hokkaido and Kyushu. However, with patronage on many non-urban local lines continuing to decline due to factors such as rising levels of car ownership and declining rural populations, further closures are planned. For example, On October 16, 2015, JR West announced that it was considering closing the 108 km Sanko Line due to poor patronage, and was in discussion with the two prefectures served by the line, Shimane and Hiroshima, as well as other municipalities served, concerning future plans. In fiscal 2014, the line carried an average of 50 passengers per km per day, compared to 458 per km per day in 1987. The entire line closed on March 31, 2018.\n\nOn November 19, 2016, JR Hokkaido's President announced plans to further rationalise its network by up to 1,237 km, or ~50% of the current network, including closure of the remaining section of the Rumoi Main Line (the Rumoi - Mashike section closed on December 4, 2016), the Shin-Yubari - Yubari section of the Sekisho Line, the non-electrified section of the Sassho Line and the Nemuro Line between Furano and Kami-Ochiai Junction. Other lines including the Sekihoku Main Line, Senmo Main Line, the Nayoro - Wakkanai section of the Soya Line and Kushiro - Nemuro section of the Nemuro Line are proposed for conversion to Third Sector operation, but if local governments are not agreeable, such sections will also face closure.\n\nFukuoka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Yokohama have subway systems. However, unlike Europe, the vast majority of passenger traffic is on suburban commuter trains that criss-cross metropolitan areas. In addition, many cities have streetcar and monorail networks.\n\nJapan pioneered the high-speed shinkansen or \"bullet train\", which now links Japan's largest cities at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). However, other trains running on the conventional line or \"zairaisen\" remain relatively slow, operating at fastest 160 km/h and mostly under 130 km/h.\n\nJapan's railways carried 31 million tons (21 billion tonne-kilometres) of goods in 2013-14. The share of railways in the national logistics is as small as 6.2% (2010), by far the lowest in the G8.\n\nRailways are the most important means of passenger transportation in Japan, maintaining this status since the late nineteenth century. Government policy promoted railways as an efficient transportation system for a country that lacks fossil fuels and is nearly completely dependent on imports.\n\nRural land near large cities was acquired cheaply by private railway companies from the late nineteenth century, which then built lines that became the backbone of urban transport between the suburbs and cities formed around the railway lines radiating out from metropolitan areas, similar to suburban growth around railways in other nations.\n\nDespite this efficiency, growing affluence and associated car ownership led to road transportation usage increasing to the detriment of rail from the 1960s. The relative share of railways in total passenger kilometers fell from 66.7 percent in 1965 to 42 percent in 1978, and 29.8 percent in 1990, although this still accounted for the largest percentage of the OECD member countries.\n\nThe figure is 43.5% (as of 2001) in the largest metropolitan areas in Japan: Tokyo (including Chiba, Saitama, Tokyo, and Kanagawa Prefectures), Osaka (including Kyoto, Osaka, and Hyōgo Prefectures), and Nagoya. Private automobiles in Greater Tokyo account for less than 20% of daily trips as car ownership is restricted to those with a dedicated parking space.\n\n\nThe Japan Railways Group, more commonly known as JR Group, is a group of successors of the government-owned Japanese National Railways (JNR). The JR Group lies at the heart of Japan's railway network, operating almost all intercity rail services and a large proportion of commuter rail services.\n\nThe six passenger operating companies of the JR Group are separated by region, but many operate long-distance train services beyond their regional boundaries. The six companies are: Hokkaido Railway Company, East Japan Railway Company, Central Japan Railway Company, West Japan Railway Company, Shikoku Railway Company, and Kyushu Railway Company.\n\nFreight service belongs to Japan Freight Railway Company or JR Freight which operates all freight network previously owned by JNR.\n\nJapan also features multiple competing private railway systems. In post-war Japan, the Japanese government encouraged private corporations to develop their own mass transit systems in order to quickly rebuild the country's urban transport networks.\n\nPrivate rail lines were encouraged to compete with each other as well as the national rail lines with the government's role limited to regulation of fares. In exchange for developing rail lines, private corporations were given business opportunities to diversify their operations and develop the real estate surrounding their railway networks.\n\nBy allowing private corporations to control transit oriented developments as well as railway lines, planned communities were facilitated allowing private railway operators to establish a vertically integrated business of developing residential, business, industrial and retail land and the commuting methods used by the populace to travel between such areas.\n\nAs such, through diversification of their business, the majority of the private railways in Japan are financially independent and their railway operations are usually profitable, in sharp contrast to most transit networks in other countries.\n\nThe following 16 companies are classified as the major private railways and are operating 2,870.1 kilometers of railways. In a one-year period from April 2009, a total of 9.46 billion passengers (118 billion passenger kilometers) traveled on these major railways.\n\nOther railway operators include\n\nIn the legal sense, there are two types (with several subcategories) of rail transportation systems in Japan: and . Every public rail transportation system under government regulation in Japan is classified either as railway or tramway. In principle, tramways can have sections shared with road traffic while railways cannot, but the choice may seem rather arbitrary in certain cases. For example, Osaka Metro is a tram system while subways in other cities are railways.\n\nRailways and trams are respectively regulated by the and the .\n\nUnder the Railway Business Act, operations of \"railways\" (in the legal meaning) are divided into three categories: Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3.\nThey are defined by the Act as follows:\n\n\nMost railway operations in Japan are Category 1. Examples of Category 2 railway businesses include most operations of the Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight) and the JR Tōzai Line operation of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). Examples of Category 3 railway businesses include the Kōbe Rapid Transit Railway company and the government of Aomori Prefecture with regards to the Aoimori Railway.\n\nThe rail system of Japan consists of the following (as of 2009):\n\nThe national railway network was started and has been expanded with the narrow gauge. Railways with broader gauge are limited to those built not intending to provide through freight and passenger transport with the existing national network. The shinkansen network uses standard gauge. Recently, the standard gauge freight railway network (partially electrified with 25 kV AC) is proposed for Hokkaido, Honshu and the northernmost Kyushu (Kanmon strait - Hakata).\n\nElectrification systems used by the JR Group are 1,500 V DC and 20 kV AC for conventional lines, and 25 kV AC for Shinkansen. Electrification with 600 V DC and 750 V DC are also seen in private lines. Frequency of AC power supply is 50 Hz in eastern Japan and 60 Hz in western Japan.\n\nJapanese national network operated by Japan Railways Group employs narrow gauge and has maximum width of and maximum height of ; however, a number JR lines were constructed as private railways prior to nationalisation in the early 20th century, and feature loading gauges smaller than the standard. These include the Chūō Main Line west of Takao, the Minobu Line, and the Yosan Main Line west of Kan'onji　( height). Nevertheless, advances in pantograph technology have largely eliminated the need for separate rolling stock in these areas.\n\nThere are many private railway companies in Japan and the loading gauge is different for each company.\n\n\nRail transport in Japan is usually for a fee. In principle a fare is pre-charged and a ticket is issued in exchange for a payment of fare. A ticket is inspected at a manned or automated gate in the station where a travel starts and is collected at the station where the travel ends.\n\nA ticket required for a travel by railway is called a , the price of which is . The fare ticket is valid regardless of number of transfers. Long-distance travellers (usually longer than 101 km) are allowed unlimited number of along the route subject to the duration of the validity of the fare ticket. In addition, a ride on a specific train and/or coach may require a .\n\nExcept for very short railways and some tram systems with a flat fare, fare varies by distances or number of zones travelled. The pricing based on the time of travel (peak or off-peak) is not common in Japan. for children between 6 and 12 is half of adult fare. Recent development in the fare collection system is the stored-value card systems shared by multiple operators in large cities, such as Suica, Pasmo and PiTaPa, by which passengers can avoid consultation with complicated fare tables and lineups for ticket machines before each train ride.\n\nThere are many types of surcharges. For example, in JR, surcharges include:\n\nAn unusual feature of Japanese surcharges, compared with other train systems, is that they often require a \"separate\" ticket. Thus, if riding the shinkansen, for instance, rather than purchasing a single shinkansen ticket, one purchases two tickets: a fare ticket (乗車券) for the distance traveled, and an additional to allow one to ride the shinkansen for that distance, rather than ordinary trains. Since express trains are not separated by special gates from ordinary trains, express service requires manual inspection of tickets by a conductor, and express tickets can be purchased from the conductor. In short, the fare ticket allows access to the train platforms at entrance and exit, where it is inspected by the gate or attendant at the station, while the express ticket allows one to ride an express train over the interval and is inspected by a conductor on the train.\n\nSuburban or intercity railway lines usually set several with different stop patterns.\n\nA train that stops at every station is called a . Only a fare ticket is required to ride local trains. Trains that stop at fewer stations and are therefore faster than local trains are classified as , , , etc. and may require surcharges depending on company policies. Railways with many types of trains use prefixes like \"semi-\", \"rapid-\", \"section-\", or \"commuter-\". For example, the Tōbu Isesaki Line has Local, Section Semi-Express, Semi-Express, Section Express, Express, Rapid, Section Rapid, and Limited Express.\n\nTrain operators usually name long distance trains (Kintetsu is a rare exception of this practice). The process of ticket reservation utilizes the train names instead of the train numbers. Train numbers are almost exclusively for professional use.\n\nAll the railway and tram lines in Japan are named by the operators. In principle (with some exceptions), a section of railway has only one name. Line names are shown on a ticket to indicate the route of the ticket. Passengers refer the railway by the name of line (e.g. \"Tōyoko Line\") or the name of operator (e.g. \"Hanshin\").\n\nThe line names may come from a name of destination or a city along the line (e.g. the \"Takasaki Line\" goes to Takasaki, Gunma); a name of region (e.g. the \"Tōhoku Main Line\" goes through the Tōhoku region); an abbreviation of provinces or cities (e.g. the \"Gonō Line\" connects Goshogawara and Noshiro); or a course of the line (e.g. the \"Tōzai Line\" means the East-West Line).\n\nLine names were used as a basis for the restructuring of JNR in the 1980s. The railway business was evaluated line-by-line in order to identify significantly unprofitable lines for closure. This left some unnamed branch lines, which would have been closed if they had line names, unaffected by the restructure.\n\nIn some cases the current route of a railway has changed but the historic line name has not reflected the change, in which case the operational name will be different from the original line name. Examples include the Keihin-Tōhoku Line and the Shōnan-Shinjuku Line.\n\nIn addition to its extensive railway network, Japan has a large number of subway systems. The largest is the Tokyo subway, where the network in 1989 consisted of 211 kilometers of track serving 205 stations. Two subway systems serve the capital: one run by the Tokyo Metro (named Teito Rapid Transit Authority until 2004), with nine lines (the oldest, Ginza line was built in 1927), and the other operated by the Tokyo metropolitan government's Transportation Bureau (Toei), with four lines. Outlying and suburban areas are served by seven private railway companies, whose lines intersect at major stations with the subway system. More than sixty additional kilometers of subway were under construction in 1990 by the two companies.\n\nThere are a number of other metro systems in other Japanese cities, including the Fukuoka City Subway, Kobe Municipal Subway, Kyoto Municipal Subway, Osaka Metro, Nagoya Subway, Sapporo Subway, Sendai Subway and Yokohama Subway.\n\nWhile metro systems in Japanese cities are usually operated by the city government and therefore tend to limit their networks within the city border, there are many cases of through services using subway trains on suburban railway lines and vice versa. One of the reasons for this situation was the sharp increase of ridership on the railways in the rapid growth of the postwar economy that could not be handled by small original railway terminals in the city center.\n\nAutomated guideway transit (rubber-tired motor cars running on concrete guideways) has also developed in Japan. Cities with such intermediate capacity transit systems include Hiroshima, Kobe, Osaka, Saitama and Tokyo.\n\nSome cities operate streetcar systems, including Hiroshima, Matsuyama, Nagasaki, Tokyo (one line only) and Toyohashi. All of these cities are also well served by public and private railroads; also, there are private tramways not included above.\n\nJapanese railways are among the most punctual in the world. The average delay on the Tokaido Shinkansen in fiscal 2018 was 0.7 minutes. When trains are delayed for five minutes, the conductor makes an announcement apologizing for the delay and the railway company may provide a \"delay certificate\" (), as no one would expect a train to be this late. Japanese passengers rely heavily on rail transit and take it for granted that trains operate on time. When trains are delayed for an hour or more, it may even appear in the newspaper. However, some argue that railway staff are under too much pressure from the public. These stringent standards are considered contributors to the cause of serious accidents such as the Amagasaki rail crash in 2005.\n\nOne of the most widely publicized crimes committed on trains is \"chikan\" or groping, taking advantage of overcrowded cars and a reluctance for people to ask for help, or to jump to the aid of another. A recent trend for railway companies to promote their lines is to service female-only cars on some trains (typically during morning rush-hours and late night trains, and often the front or back car) and is quickly becoming a standard practice, especially among Tokyo's busy commuter lines.\n\nThe Japanese language has a number of expressions for unlawfully riding trains without paying the correct fare. One is \"Satsuma-no-kami.\" It is a reference to Taira Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori, a member of the Taira clan who is mentioned in the Tale of the Heike. His name, Tadanori, is pronounced the same as words meaning \"riding for free\".\n\nAnother expression is \"kiseru jōsha.\" This refers to a \"kiseru\", a smoking pipe that has a long hollow section made of bamboo between the bowl (where the smoke enters) and the mouthpiece (where it leaves) made of metal. Based on an association of metal and money, \"kiseru jōsha\" is the practice of using one ticket to enter the train system and a different ticket to exit, with a long unpaid segment in the middle – purchasing two separate tickets, covering just the initial and final segments of the journey (corresponding to the bowl and mouthpiece), rather than one ticket for the whole length.\n\nOther notable crimes staged in railway facilities in Japan include the assassination of the Prime Minister Hara Takashi in Tokyo Station in 1921, the deliberate train wreck at Mitaka Station in 1949 and the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.\n\nTrains are also used as a means to commit suicide. Its relative popularity is partly due to its practical ease, and to avoid causing a nuisance to one's family, although families are often charged or sued by the railway companies to compensate for the trouble caused by the accident. Suicides often cause delays on the lines on which they occur. The deceased's family may be charged damages on the order of approximately 1 million yen by railway operating companies. Railroad operators have taken steps to discourage and prevent suicides. This includes use of blue LED lights in stations, which officials hope will calm potential jumpers. Platform edge doors are also being installed at numerous stations in an effort to keep people contained on the platform until the train arrives.\n\nAn important aspect of the romance of the rails in Japan is the \"ekiben\", the station bento lunchbox. The first pre-packed station lunchboxes originated at Utsunomiya Station in 1885 and became an instant success. Many stations (eki) around the country soon began to make special bento featuring local specialties such as seafood, meat or vegetables. Including generous portions of rice, the ekiben was a complete meal. It was often served in a wooden box; nowadays cardboard and plastics have become popular, although wooden chopsticks still accompany the ekiben. The Central Committee of the Japanese Association of Railroad Station Concessionaires (社団法人日本鉄道構内営業中央会) is a prominent trade organization promoting ekiben.\n\nJapanese books and television feature rail transport in various contexts. Examples include travelogues visiting rustic routes or unusual trains or murder mysteries on sleeper trains.\n\nA major television series based on rail transport, Ressha Sentai ToQger, was broadcast on TV Asahi from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

According to legend, it was probably founded at the time of the Saracen invasions, during or after the 10th century. By this time, the Saracens had settled around Rombiolo. \nRicadi appears to have been almost reduced to rubble by the earthquake which struck towards the end of the 18th century, it was also heavily damaged by the one which struck at the beginning of the 20th century. \nThe place-name 'Ricade' or 'Rigade' appeared for the first time in the 16th and 17th centuries, and suggests a derivation from the surname 'Riga' or 'Rigà', which was quite surname in Calabria.\n\nOver the centuries Ricadi has been populated by Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, and Normans: they built and blasted road and defensive infrastructures (roads, bridges, towers defending coasts and rivers). Many archaeological discoveries are still visible; others are well protected, being houses in the National Museum of Reggio Calabria.\n\nFor a time, Ricadi was ancillary to the town of Tropea. In 1799 the Ricadesi obtained their independence thanks to Championnet, a French general who conquered the Kingdom of Naples (which Ricadi was formerly part of).\n\nRicadi became a municipality of the Monteleone district (now Vibo Valentia), belonging to Calabria Ulteriore, because of a rule set in 1811.\n\nBefore becoming one of the main tourist destinations of the lower Tyrrhennian Sea, Grotticelle was populated by people who lived on agriculture and fishing. By the mid '80s, this place became one of the main economic driving force of the overall economy of Ricadi. Thanks to tourism, over the past decades, incomes and living standards have increasingly improved for local inhabitants (according to some, the per capita income of the little town is one of the highest in Calabria).\n\nNear Grotticelle hundreds of tourist structures have been built: these include camping-sites, tourist villages located near the sea, 2 to 5 star hotels, residences and farm holidays located in the hills.\n\n\"The Farming Museum\" (), opened to the public in May 1992. The collection, made up by near to 500 finds, shows variety rudimentary farming machinery, tools to process local crops such as flax and broom fibre, and terracotta ware.

Anderson was also a politician, a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1852 to 1856.\n\nAnderson was born in Keoldale, Sutherland, Scotland, the son of James Anderson of the township of Respond, Durness.\n\nAnderson joined the 78th Regiment at the age of fifteen. He saw action in the Napoleonic Wars – at the Battle of Maida, Egypt, the Peninsular War, and Guadeloupe. In 1826 he was appointed major in the 50th Regiment, and arrived in Sydney, New South Wales in 1834.\n\nAnderson was sent by Governor Bourke to Norfolk Island following the unsuccessful revolt of the convicts during the last days of James Morisset and his deputy Foster Fyans. As a result of Anderson's investigation into the revolt, thirteen convicts were executed and sixteen others sentenced to death but had their sentences commuted. Anderson encouraged religious teaching for the convicts, and began a school, teaching the convicts how to read. Many of the convict buildings still standing on the island were built during Anderson's rule, including the Commissariat's building, used today as the Anglican church, and the stone houses along what is known today as Quality Row. Punishments continued to be severe – five men received 1,500 lashes before breakfast on one occasion – and Anderson extracted harsh extremes of labour from the prisoners, punishing anyone who lagged behind and making them work after hours until they dropped. The island was relatively peaceful under Anderson's administration, although the Reverend Thomas Atkins thought him unfitted for the position, and accused him of cruelties, fraud and gross abuses of his position for financial gain.\n\nFollowing his time at Norfolk Island, Anderson took up land at Mangalore in the Port Phillip District (later the colony of Victoria) of New South Wales. He served another stint in the army in India, and commanded a brigade in the Gwalior campaign in 1843, during which he was severely wounded, he returned to Australia and settled in South Yarra. From 14 July 1852 to March 1856 Anderson was a nominated member of the first Victorian Legislative Council, replacing Alexander Dunlop. In the Council Anderson supported the Convicts Prevention Act, which was designed to prevent the influx of convicts from Tasmania into Victoria; and when the measure, having been disallowed by the Imperial authorities, was again adopted by the Council in the ensuing session; and opposed the influx of Chinese gold miners. Anderson unsuccessfully contested the election for the new Victorian Legislative Council seat of Eastern Province in 1856.\n\nAnderson died in South Yarra, Melbourne, on 18 July 1877.\n\nIn 1837 Major Anderson was created K.H., and subsequently he received the C.B. in 1844.\n\nJohn Barry described Anderson as a \"firm disciplinarian, … [and] a courageous soldier, but limited in outlook and with a well-developed acquisitive sense.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2153570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153570", "title": "Palilalia", "text": "Palilalia\n\nPalilalia (from the Greek πάλιν (\"pálin\") meaning \"again\" and λαλιά (\"laliá\") meaning \"speech\" or \"to talk\"), a complex tic, is a language disorder characterized by the involuntary repetition of syllables, words, or phrases. It has features resembling other complex tics such as echolalia or coprolalia, but, unlike other aphasias, palilalia is based upon contextually correct speech.\nIt was originally described by Alexandre-Achille Souques in a patient with stroke that resulted in left-side hemiplegia, although a condition described as auto-echolalia in 1899 by Édouard Brissaud may have been the same condition.\n\nPalilalia is considered an aphasia, a disorder of language, and is not to be confused with speech disorders, as there is no difficulty in the formation of internal speech. Palilalia is similar to speech disorders such as stuttering or cluttering, as it tends to only express itself in spontaneous speech, such as answering basic questions, and not in automatic speech such as reading or singing; however, it distinctively affects words and phrases rather than syllables and sounds.\n\nPalilalia may occur in conditions affecting the pre-frontal cortex or basal ganglia regions, either from physical trauma, neurodegenerative disorders, genetic disorders, or a loss of dopamine in these brain regions. Palilalia occurs most commonly in Tourette syndrome and may be present in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\nPalilalia is defined as the repetition of the speaker's words or phrases, often for a varying number of repeats. Repeated units are generally whole sections of words and are larger than a syllable, with words being repeated the most often, followed by phrases, and then syllables or sounds. Palilalic repetitions are often spoken with decreasing volume and speed up over time.\n\nA 2007 case study by Van Borsel \"et al.\" examined the acoustic features in palilalia. AB, a 60-year-old male was diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and had noticed changes in gait, posture, writing, and speech. Observation of his perceptual speech characteristics and Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment results suggested AB suffered from hypokinetic dysarthria with a marked palilalia. It was determined to start speech therapy with passive (metronome) and active (pacing boards) pacing techniques to reduce the number of palilalic repetitions. Unfortunately AB was not able to enunciate despite extensive training.\n\nAnalysis of AB's speech therapy showed that his repetitions lasted from 1 minute 33 seconds to 2 minutes 28 seconds, ranging from 1 to 32 repetitions on some words, and differed from trial to trial. Pauses were present between each repetition, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 seconds. Van Borsel \"et al.\" concluded that AB's palilalic repetitions followed no pattern: the duration of each repetition train did not decrease over time, the number of repetitions per train did not increase, and the duration of each individual word did not decrease in duration. Such results indicated not all palilalic repetitions show an increasing rate with decreasing volume, and defied the two distinct subtypes of palilalia as suggested by Sterling. Sterling's Type A, sometimes called \"palilalie spasmodique\", is characterized by fast repetitions and decreasing volume, while Sterling's Type B, sometimes called \"palilalie atonique\", is characterized by repetitions at a constant rate with interspersed periods of silence. AB showed neither a systematic increase (Sterling's Type A) or a constant duration (Sterling's Type B) and instead fell between the two.\n\nPalilalia has been theorized to occur in writing and sign language. A case study by Tyrone and Moll examined a 79-year-old right-handed deaf man named PSP who showed anomalies in his signing. PSP had learned British sign language (BSL) at the age of seven and had developed left-sided weakness and dysphagia at age 77. PSP showed involuntary movements and repetitions in his signing. Tyrone and Moll reported his movements were palilalic in nature, as entire signs were repeated and the repetitional movements became smaller and smaller in amplitude.\n\nPalilalia also occurs in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, occurring most commonly in Tourette syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Such degradation can occur in the substantia nigra where decreased dopamine production results in a loss of function. It can also occur in a variety of genetic disorders including Fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Asperger syndrome and autism.\n\nPalilalia must be differentiated from other complex tic disorders (such as echolalia), stuttering, and logoclonia. In contrast to stuttering or logoclonia, palilalic repetitions tend to consist of complete sections of words or phrases, are often repeated many times, and the speaker has no difficulty initiating speech.\n"}

A learning cycle will have a number of stages or phases, the last of which can be followed by the first.\n\nIn 1933, John Dewey described five phases or aspects of reflective thought: \n\nIn the 1940s, Kurt Lewin developed action research and described a cycle of:\n\nLewin particularly highlighted the need for fact finding, which he felt was missing from much of management and social work. He contrasted this to the military where \n\nIn the early 1970s, David A. Kolb and Ronald E. Fry developed the experiential learning model (ELM), composed of four elements:\n\nTesting the new concepts gives concrete experience which can be observed and reflected upon, allowing the cycle to continue.\n\nKolb integrated this learning cycle with a theory of learning styles, wherein each style prefers two of the four parts of the cycle. The cycle is quadrisected by a horizontal and vertical axis. The vertical axis represents how knowledge can be grasped, through \"concrete experience\" or through \"abstract conceptualization\", or by a combination of both. The horizontal axis represents how knowledge is transformed or constructed through \"reflective observation\" or \"active experimentation\". These two axes form the four quadrants that can be seen as four stages: concrete experience (CE), reflective observation (RO), abstract conceptualization (AC) and active experimentation (AE) and as four styles of learning: diverging, assimilating, converging and accommodating. The concept of learning styles has been criticised, see .\n\nPeter Honey and Alan Mumford developed Kolb and Fry's ideas into slightly different learning cycle. The stages are:\n\nWhile the cycle can be entered at any of the four stages, a cycle must be completed to give learning that will change behaviour. The cycle can be performed multiple times to build up layers of learning.\n\nHoney and Mumford gave names (also called \"learning styles\") to the people who prefer to enter the cycle at different stages: \"Activist\", \"Reflector\", \"Theorist\" and \"Pragmatist\". Honey and Mumford's learning styles questionnaire has been criticized for poor reliability and validity.\n\nThe 5E learning cycle was developed by Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, specifically for use in teaching science. The learning cycle has four phases:\n\nThe fifth E stands for Evaluate; in which the instructor observes each student's knowledge and understanding, and leads students to assess whether what they have learned is true. Evaluation should take place throughout the cycle, not within its own set phase.\n\nIn the 1990s, Alistair Smith developed the Accelerated Learning Cycle, also for use in teaching. The phases are:\n\nUnlike other learning cycles, step 8 is normally followed by step 2, rather than step 1.\n\nIn the 2000s, Fred Korthagen and Angelo Vasalos (and others) developed the ALACT model, specifically for use in personal development. The five phases of the ALACT cycle are:\n\nAs with Kolb and Fry, trial is an action that can be looked back on. Korthagen and Vasalos listed coaching interventions for each phase and described \"levels of reflection\" inspired by Gregory Bateson's hierarchy of logical types. In 2010, they connected their model of reflective learning to the practice of mindfulness and to Otto Scharmer's Theory U, which, in contrast to a learning cycle, emphasizes reflecting on a desired future rather than on past experience.\n"}

Headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, the organization includes 32 affiliates and serves approximately 1.5 million people each year in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nIn addition to those in need of affordable housing, VOA assists veterans, low-income seniors, children and families, the homeless, those with intellectual disabilities, those recovering from addiction, and the formerly incarcerated.\n\nVolunteers of America was founded on March 8, 1896 by social reformers Ballington Booth and his wife Maud Booth in Cooper Union's Great Hall. Ballington Booth was the son of General William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, and the couple served as officers with the Army in Great Britain.\n\nThe Booths first moved to New York in the 1890s to assume command of The Salvation Army forces in the United States. The couple was successful in bolstering the image of The Salvation Army in America and in growing the movement's social work mission. After disagreements with other Salvation Army leaders, including Ballington Booth's brother Bramwell Booth, the Booths left the organization and established Volunteers of America.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the organization began an expansive philanthropic program that included employment bureaus, co-operative stores, medical dispensaries, distribution of clothes, women's sewing classes, Thanksgiving meals, reading rooms, fresh air camps and other establishments. During the advent of the Great Depression in the 1930s, Volunteers of America mobilized to assist the millions of people who were unemployed, hungry and homeless. Relief efforts included employment bureaus, wood yards, soup kitchens and \"Penny Pantries\" where every food item cost one cent.\n\nBy the 1960s, Volunteers of America was well known for its thrift stores and annual fundraising efforts like the Sidewalk Santa campaign in New York City. In an effort to modernize its programs, the organization began to focus its work in the area of housing for the poor following the establishment of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nVolunteers of America is ranked among the largest charities in the United States by \"The NonProfit Times\", \"The Chronicle of Philanthropy\" and \"Forbes\" among other publications, with annual revenue of more than $1 billion in 2015. The organization is one of the largest nonprofit providers of affordable housing for the elderly, low-income families and people with intellectual or physical disabilities in the United States.\n\nWhen Volunteers of America was founded in 1896, volunteerism in the modern sense of the word did not exist. To \"volunteer\" at that time meant serving others as a full-time vocation. Early members of the organization came to call themselves the \"Volunteers of America\" to differentiate themselves from The Salvation Army as an organization by Americans, for Americans.\n\nIn fact, Volunteers of America is staffed primarily by paid staff, rather than unpaid volunteers. More than 16,000 paid professionals serve as administrators, caregivers, skilled nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, housing experts, architects, and a number of other positions at the organization.\n\nAs of 2017 the organization owned and/or managed around 19,000 affordable housing units that provide homes to nearly 25,000 people each year.\n\nIn 2009 \"Affordable Housing Finance\" magazine ranked Volunteers of America as the top nonprofit in its \"Top 50 Affordable Housing Owners,\" and also ranked the organization in the \"Top 50 Affordable Housing Developers\" in 2007 and \"Top 10 Companies Completing Acquisitions.\" The magazine also selected a Volunteers of America multifamily community, Lord Tennyson outside San Francisco, as the \"best of the best\" affordable housing project in the country for 2007.\n\nVoA also reaches out to homeless people in many cities through street outreach and mobile outreach services.\n\nIn 2017, Volunteers of America has donated a backpack to every student living in New York City shelters, resulting in the donation of over 140,000 backpacks over 14 years.\n\n"}

Polk, was an American farmer, journalist and political figure. He was a leader of the Farmers' Alliance and helped found the Populist Party.\n\nHe was born in Anson County, North Carolina. L.L. Polk fought in the American Civil War for the Confederate States of America, and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nReturning to North Carolina after the war, he founded the town of Polkton, incorporated in 1875, where he started a weekly newspaper called \"The Ansonian\". Through it he advocated for farmers and for the Grange movement. Polk, a distant relative of President James K. Polk, became active in state politics, serving in the North Carolina House of Representatives and as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1865–66. In 1877, he was appointed the first North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture and served until 1880. An agricultural collection he established as Commissioner was the basis for what became the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n\nHe returned to journalism by founding the \"Progressive Farmer\" in 1886 in Winston. The magazine is still published to this day. At first, the paper's primary aim was to teach new agricultural methods, but soon it also focused on politics.\n\nMeanwhile, he was also active in the Baptist church, once serving as president of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. Polk was instrumental in establishing the North Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical College and Baptist Female University.\n\nIn the late 1880s, he rose to nationwide prominence through his leadership of the state and national Farmers' Alliance, which had begun in Texas. He became its national vice president in 1887 and its president in 1889. These words, spoken in 1887, were typical of Polk's rhetoric: \"Our farmers buy everything to raise cotton, and raise cotton to buy everything, and, after going through this treadmill business for years, they lie down and die and leave their families penniless.\"\n\nThe Alliance's mixed record using traditional two-party politics paved the way for the Populist Party, or People's Party. Polk presided over the meeting in February 1892 that formally created the party. The Populists likely would have nominated Polk for president in 1892 (see 1892 U.S. presidential election), but he died unexpectedly from a hemorrhaging bladder in Washington, D.C. on June 11, 1892.\n\nHe was one of the first inductees into the North Carolina Agricultural Hall of Fame.\n\nHis home in Raleigh, NC is today owned by the state of North Carolina. It was moved on Nov. 12, 2000, to its new location on Blount Street in Raleigh. The Leonidas LaFayette Polk House Foundation plans to use part of the house for the Polk Museum. The rest will be used for state offices.\n\nPolk Hall at North Carolina State University was named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

In 1998, Mench led the NCAA with 33 home runs and knocked in 72 runs to earn Collegiate Baseball National Player of the Year and consensus All-America Honors. In the America East, he was named Rookie of the Year in 1997 and Player of the Year in 1998 and 1999. In 1998, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. On June 2, 1999, the Texas Rangers drafted Mench in the fourth round with the 118th overall pick. For his accomplishments, Mench was inducted into the University of Delaware athletics hall of fame in 2005.\n\nIn his rookie year, , Mench hit 15 home runs, tied for third among rookies, and drove in 60 runs. He finished 7th in the American League Rookie of the Year balloting. After an injury-plagued , Mench responded in by setting career bests in batting average (.279), home runs (26), RBI (71) and slugging percentage (.539). He followed that up by posting similar numbers in , though in 25 more games.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Mench hit 3 home runs in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\n\nOn April 26, , Mench became the 19th player in major league history to hit a home run in at least six straight games. The streak started, oddly, not too long after Mench discovered that a recurring toe injury was due to a shoe problem – he had been wearing size 12 shoes since his teenage years, but discovered his actual shoe size was 12½.\n\nOn April 28, Mench extended his home run streak to seven straight games, shattering his own franchise record with the Texas Rangers, and setting an all-time record for right-handed batters. The current record for most consecutive games with a home run is 8, held by Dale Long, Don Mattingly, and Ken Griffey, Jr.\n\nOn July 26, 2006, Mench hit a 2-run double against the New York Yankees, the 50,000th hit in Rangers franchise history; two days later, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with Francisco Cordero, Laynce Nix, and Julian Cordero, for Carlos Lee and Nelson Cruz. Mench got his first hit with the Brewers on July 29, 2006, against the Cincinnati Reds, where he also collected an RBI.\n\nDuring the subsequent offseason, Mench had been repeatedly criticized by Brewers fans on radio programs for his lackluster 2006 performance with the Brewers. Mench hit only .230 with 1 home run and 18 runs batted in for the Brewers. Mench also stated he did not want to platoon in left field, taken by many fans as an excessive demand considering his performance for the Brewers so far.\n\nOn January 16, , Mench and the Brewers agreed on a one-year contract for the 2007 season that would pay him $3.4 million. he was not offered a new contract by the Brewers and became a free agent on December 12, 2007. On February 12, , Mench signed a minor league deal to return to the Rangers.\n\nOn May 9, , Mench was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for cash considerations. On August 25, 2008, Mench was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse by the Blue Jays, but was recalled in early September.\n\nOn December 24, 2008, Mench signed a one-year deal to with the Hanshin Tigers of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.\n\nOn February 2, 2010, Mench signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals.\n\nOn February 18, 2012, Mench confirmed on his Twitter account his retirement from Major League Baseball.\n\nHe is married to former Chicago White Sox baseball player Scott Podsednik's sister, Shana.

{"id": "2153629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153629", "title": "The Sentinel (TV series)", "text": "The Sentinel (TV series)\n\nThe Sentinel is a Canadian-American action crime drama series that aired on UPN in the United States from March 20, 1996 to May 24, 1999. It premiered on March 20, 1996, and ran for 65 episodes over four seasons. The series later re-aired on Syfy.\n\nJim Ellison was a US Army Ranger who spent 18 months in the Peruvian jungle after the rest of his unit was killed. He developed hyperacute senses from surviving in the wild, but repressed them when he returned to civilization. His sensory abilities re-manifested five years later, while conducting an extended stakeout in the forest as a detective in the Major Crimes Unit of the Cascade, Washington, police department. He went to a hospital for an examination where he met Blair Sandburg, an anthropologist from Rainier University, whom Ellison initially mistook for a physician. Upon hearing Ellison's story, Sandburg declares that Ellison is a \"Sentinel\": in ancient tribes, Sentinels used their enhanced senses to protect their village. For Jim, Cascade is his village. Blair had been studying Sentinel mythology for years. While he found many individuals with one or two hyperactive senses, he had never before found a person with all five senses enhanced, a \"true\" Sentinel.\n\nBlair helps Jim control his senses and joins Jim as a police observer. Their unlikely partnership works, and together they fight crime in the streets of Cascade. The only person aside from Sandburg who knows Jim's secret is his captain and friend, Simon Banks.\n\n\n\nJim Ellison was born with hyperactive senses. During his childhood, he had a friend, Bud who helped him with said senses. Unfortunately, Bud was murdered at some point, one of many cases of trauma in his childhood. His mother also left, leaving him to live with his extremely wealthy father, William Ellison, and his brother, Steven Ellison. Jim's relationship with both characters is notably strained, and leads to both the repression of his senses and his joining the Army.\n\nWhile in the Army, Jim achieves the rank of Captain in the US Army Rangers, working covert ops. His last mission (for 7th group special forces - ODA 731) takes him and his team of seven to Peru to stop a drug-smuggling campaign. Unfortunately, his ranking officer was corrupt and set him and his men up for failure. His helicopter crashes, killing his seven men and leaving him wounded. He is taken in by the Chopec, an elusive and secretive tribe in Peru, and learns to control his senses for the tribe's betterment under the tutelage of Incacha, the tribe's shaman, who calls Jim \"Enqueri\" (\"Sentinel\"). The following year, when a satellite photo shows seven tombstones at the helicopter's crash site instead of just a pile of scrap metal, the US Army sends in a team to find the sole survivor of the crash and bring him back home.\n\nDuring the series, in flashbacks of Jim's military time, his various military awards and badges were shown on his military uniform. For example in Season 2 Episode 15 \"Secrets\", Jim's Silver Star medal is shown . Additionally in the pilot, Jim is shown to be wearing a Combat Infantryman Badge and the Parachutist Breast Badge on his uniform. In Season 4 Episode 4 \"Dead End on Blank Street\", Jim is also shown to be wearing a Combat Medic Breast Badge.\n\nWhen Jim returns to Cascade, Washington, he represses the memories of his time in Peru. Nevertheless, his instincts as a Sentinel remain, leading him to \"serve and protect\" his \"tribe\", the residents of Cascade, by joining the police force. Eventually assigned to Vice, he is mentored by Jack Pendergrast, who helps Jim tame his temper and his rebellious attitude. Jim later marries Carolyn Plummer, another detective on the force. Jack then dies, and Carolyn and Jim divorce.\n\nShortly afterwards, Jim is sent on a solitary stakeout for a week in a remote woodland location, during which his senses start to re-emerge, primarily his sight and hearing. After his return to the city, his enhanced senses fully emerge, leaving him feeling disoriented, \"stressed out\" and drugged. He can see, hear, and smell things that no other person could, he can only handle the blandest of foods, and any barely-coarse materials leave him wishing to claw his skin off. He checks himself into a hospital, where he meets Blair Sandburg posing as Doctor McCoy (as it says on the stolen lab coat he wears) or Doctor McKay (as he pronounces it).\n\nDuring the series Jim falls in love with a handful of women but most of them end up dying in his arms. Several of Jim's old friends from the Army and police force also end up dead during the course of the show.\n\nJim's hyperacute senses allow him to perceive things undetectable by normal humans. He can see perfectly in low light situations and with superb acuity at long distances, hear sounds at extremely low volume or beyond the normal range of human hearing, and sense what others cannot via taste, touch and smell; he declares himself \"a walking forensic lab\". Jim's powers have a drawback: if he concentrates too strongly on one sense, he may become oblivious to his immediate surroundings. Part of Blair's job is preventing this, and protecting Jim when he is focusing. As a Sentinel Jim has several powers:\n\nBlair Sandburg is the genius son of Naomi Sandburg, an absolute flower child. In his youth, he was all about free love and the hippie spirit, and has yet to stop. Blair had little to no stability in his youth, always moving from home to home and never settling, but that was also what spawned his love of anthropology.\n\nWhen Blair was sixteen, he moved to Cascade, Washington to begin his studies. An anthropology major, his advisor was Eli Stoddard, a major expert in the field. As he quickly moved through his education, he took many trips on grants to various parts of the globe. When he finally decided to get his doctorate, he became a teaching fellow. The topic of his dissertation was the Sentinel. This was brought about by a monograph by Sir Richard Francis Burton that described both the sentinels and their roles in their respective tribes, and their partners, acutely named by one villain: guides.\n\nAt twenty-six, Blair has an \"office\" in the basement at Rainier, and an $850 a month, warehouse apartment.\n\nDuring the course of the show Blair has several girlfriends, sometimes dating more than one woman at a time. One of his ex-girlfriends works at Cascade General, which is how he met Jim in the first place: she told him a man with complaints about all five of his senses had recently been admitted.\n\nIn Jim's visions Blair's spirit animal is a grey wolf.\n\nJim doesn't believe Blair's explanation about his senses at first. In fact, at their second meeting, Jim throws Blair up against a wall and calls him a \"neo-hippie, witch-doctor punk.\" Nevertheless, Jim's senses are a huge problem, as demonstrated when Blair has to shove Jim and himself under an oncoming garbage truck to save Jim from a zone-out. Jim later introduces Blair to Simon Banks, the chief of Major Crimes, and gets Blair a ninety-day observer's pass so that Blair can help with his senses. The excuse they give is that Blair is Jim's kid cousin, whom he is helping get his doctorate by allowing him to study the police force so he can write a dissertation on the \"thin blue line\" and the closed society of the police force.\n\nSoon after, Blair's warehouse apartment is blown up by the drug lab next door, and Jim invites Blair to stay with him at his loft apartment at 852 Prospect Ave., apartment 307. Blair temporarily brings with him Larry the Ape, the subject of a short-term sociology study. Although the arrangement is only meant to last a week, Blair stays for years.\n\nOn the job, Jim constantly reminds his wayward \"partner\" to stay in the truck, although Blair rarely listens. Also, Blair is often the victim of kidnapping and abuse by various criminals. Blair also steadily serves to complete Jim's paperwork and soothe Jim's temper. The other detectives at Major Crimes think of him fondly, and Blair has many nicknames: \"Chief\" from Jim, \"Hairboy\" from Rafe and Henri, and \"Sandy\" from Megan Connor.\n\nAt the end of season three, Blair meets a new sentinel, Ms Alex Barnes (Jeri Ryan), and agrees to help her with her senses. Jim has a \"nightmare\" (actually a vision) about killing Blair, and is haunted by apparent hallucinations (actually more visions) of Barnes' spirit animal, a spotted panther. However, at this point Blair has not told Jim there's a new Sentinel in town, and Jim is confused over the Sentinel instincts he's experiencing. Unsure of what is going on, Jim throws Blair out of the loft. Alex attacks Blair and kills him. After Blair has been pronounced dead, Jim uses the power of his animal spirit to bring Blair back from the dead. However, he's still haunted by spirit visions of Alex and is unable to control a strange attraction to her, leading to a kiss between them in front of Blair. Jim manages to regain control over his Sentinel urges. Alex, now rendered catatonic after experimenting with a drug meant to increase her sentinel abilities, is confined to a mental institution, and Blair returns to the loft.\n\nThe last episode of the series, \"'The Sentinel' by Blair Sandburg\", shows Blair finally finishing his dissertation. He's promised to allow Jim to read the paper before he turns it in but unfortunately his mother shows up at the loft, snoops on his computer, and e-mails the document to Sid Graham, a big-shot publisher in New York. Sid releases snippets of Blair's Sentinel paper to the press and the general public, who then hound Jim and Blair. To repair his relationship with his friend and fix his wrongdoing, Blair rejects a three million dollar publishing contract at a press conference where he declares his dissertation fraudulent, thus destroying his academic career. At the end of this last episode, Jim and Simon offer Blair a place in Major Crimes as a police officer should he choose to accept it.\n\n\"The Sentinel\" was canceled after 3 seasons by UPN, with the last episode being a big cliffhanger with Blair's life in the balance. An intense fan campaign convinced UPN to give the series a season of eight episodes to end the series properly.\n\nOn April 18, 2006, CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released \"The Complete First Season\" of \"The Sentinel\" on DVD in Region 1. As of 2015, this release has been discontinued and is out of print.\n\nOn May 5, 2015, it was announced that Visual Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1 and plan to release \"The Sentinel\" on DVD before the end of calendar year 2015.\n\nOn September 1, 2015, it was announced that Visual Entertainment will release \"The Sentinel – The Complete Series\" on DVD on September 22, 2015.\n\nOutside the US, the series has been broadcast by the following stations under the following names:\n"}
{"id": "2153635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153635", "title": "Donald in Mathmagic Land", "text": "Donald in Mathmagic Land\n\nDonald in Mathmagic Land is a 27-minute Donald Duck educational featurette released on June 26, 1959. \nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award, and became a widely viewed educational film in American schools of the 1960s.\nDonald Duck, holding a hunting rifle, passes through a doorway to find that he has entered Mathmagic Land. This \"mighty strange\" fantasy land contains trees with square roots, a stream flowing with numbers, and a walking pencil that plays tic-tac-toe. A geometric bird recites (almost perfectly) the first 15 digits of pi. Donald soon hears the voice of the unseen \"True Spirit of Adventure\" (Paul Frees), who will guide him on his journey through \"the wonderland of mathematics\".\n\nDonald is initially not interested in exploring Mathmagic Land, believing that math is just for \"eggheads\". When \"Mr. Spirit\" suggests a connection between math and music, though, Donald is intrigued. First, Donald discovers the relationships between octaves and string length which develop the musical scale of today. Next, Donald finds himself in ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his contemporaries are discovering these same relationships. Pythagoras (on the harp), a flute player, and a double bass player hold a \"jam session\" which Donald joins after a few moments using a vase as a bongo drum. Pythagoras' mathematical discoveries are, as the Spirit explains, the basis of today's music, and that music would not exist without \"eggheads\". The segment ends with a sequence of live action musicians playing both jazz and classical music and Pythagoras' pals fading away.\n\nAfter shaking hands with Pythagoras, who then vanishes, Donald finds on his hand a pentagram, the symbol of the secret Pythagorean society. The Spirit then shows Donald how the mysterious golden section appears in the pentagram. Next, the pentagram is shown to contain the pattern for constructing golden rectangles many times over. According to the Spirit, the golden rectangle has influenced both ancient and modern cultures in many ways.\n\nDonald learns how the golden rectangle appears in many ancient buildings, such as the Parthenon and the Notre Dame cathedral. Paintings such as the \"Mona Lisa\" and various sculptures such as the Venus de Milo contain several golden rectangles. The use of the golden rectangle is found in modern architecture, such as the United Nations building in New York City. Modern painters have also rediscovered the magic of the golden rectangles.\n\nThe Spirit shows Donald how the golden rectangle and pentagram are related to the human body and nature, respectively. The human body contains the \"ideal proportions\" of the golden section; Donald, overinterpreting the Spirit's advice, tries to make his own body fit such a proportion, but his efforts are to no avail; he ends up \"all pent up in a pentagon\". The pentagram and pentagon are then shown to be found in many flowers and animals, such as the petunia, the star jasmine, the starfish, the waxflower, and with the help of the inside of a nautilus shell, the Spirit explains that the magic proportions of the golden section are often found in the spirals of nature's designs, quoting Pythagoras: \"Everything is arranged according to number and mathematical shape\".\n\nDonald learns that mathematics applies not only to nature, architecture, and music, but also to games that are played on geometrical surfaces, including chess, baseball, football, basketball, hopscotch, and three-cushion billiards. Donald even volunteers the game Tiddlywinks, but the Spirit does not pursue this option. Themes of Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass\" are scattered throughout the chess scene; Carroll himself was both a writer and a mathematician. The extended billiards scene, which features a non-speaking live actor, shows the calculations involved in the game's \"diamond system\", and Donald finally learns how to do the calculations, spectacularly hitting ten cushions in a single shot.\n\nThe Spirit then asks Donald to play a mental game, but he finds Donald's mind to be too cluttered with \"Antiquated Ideas\", \"Bungling\", \"False Concepts\", \"Superstitions\", and \"Confusion\". After some mental house-cleaning, Donald plays with a circle and a triangle in his mind, he spins them to make them respectively into a sphere and a cone, and then he discovers useful inventions such as the wheel, train, magnifying glass, drill, spring, propeller, and telescope.\n\nDonald discovers that pentagrams can be drawn inside each other indefinitely. Therefore, numbers provide an avenue to consider the infinite. The Spirit states that scientific knowledge and technological advances are unlimited, and the key to unlocking the doors of the future is mathematics. By the end of the film, Donald understands and appreciates the value of mathematics. The film closes with a quote from Galileo: \"Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe\".\n\nThe film was directed by Hamilton Luske. Contributors included Disney artists John Hench and Art Riley, voice talent Paul Frees, and scientific expert Heinz Haber, who had worked on the Disney space shows. It was released on a bill with \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\". In 1959, it was nominated for an Academy Award for (Best Documentary – Short Subjects). In 1961, two years after its release, it was shown as part of the first program of \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" with an introduction by Ludwig Von Drake.\n\nThe film was made available to schools and became one of the most popular educational films ever made by Disney. As Walt Disney himself explained, \"The cartoon is a good medium to stimulate interest. We have recently explained mathematics in a film and in that way excited public interest in this very important subject.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2153647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153647", "title": "Edward Dyson", "text": "Edward Dyson\n\nEdward George Dyson (4 March 1865 – 22 August 1931), or 'Ted' Dyson, was an Australian journalist, poet, playwright and short story writer. He was the elder brother of illustrators Will Dyson (1880–1938) and Ambrose Dyson (1876–1913), with three sisters also of artistic and literary praise. \n\nDyson wrote under several – some say many – nom-de-plumes, including Silas Snell. In his day, the period of Australia's federation, the poet and writer was 'ranked very closely to Australia's greatest short-story writer, Henry Lawson'. With Lawson known as the 'swagman poet', Ogilvie the 'horseman poet', Dyson was the 'mining poet'. Although known as a freelance writer, he was also considered part of \"The Bulletin\" writer group. \n\nHe was born at Morrison's Diggings near Ballarat in March 1865. His father, George Dyson, arrived in Australia in 1852 and after working on various diggings became a mining engineer. His mother, Jane, née Mayall, came from 'a life of refinement in England'. Brother Will would marry Ruby Lindsay while Ruby's brother Lionel would marry the Dyson sister Jean.\n\nThe family led a roving life during Dyson's childhood, moving successively to Alfredton, Bendigo, Ballarat and Alfredton again by the time he was eleven. He was educated at the government schools in those towns until the age of thirteen. Whereas others his age were exploring the bush, he was examining abandoned mine shafts and associated buildings. He and his child friends would also be fossicking and re-washing hillsides.\n\nAt a 12-year-old he began to work as an assistant to a travelling draper (leading to the 1911 poem 'Tommy the hawker') as well as various jobs 'below and on top' in the Victorian and Tasmanian goldfields: Driving a whim horse at Ballarat, mining at Clunes and Bungaree, and panning shallow alluvial for gold at Lefroy, Tasmania, and on the Pinafore field, finding its largest nugget. His young working life also saw Dyson as a drover. Returning to Smeaton and Gordon, he was a trucker in a deep mine, then working in the battery building. About 1883 the family settled in South Melbourne, where he became a factory hand. \n\nAt 19 years of age, Dyson began writing verse first appearing in the \"Ballarat Courier\", and a few years later embarked on a life of freelance journalism which lasted until his death. Themes were often derived from his childhood exposures to mining, and later working in a factory. He recorded many ideas and maintained a card index, that allowed him to reflect and refine the contents of his writing and produce such volumes.\n\nHe penned his first sketches, about mining, when arriving in Melbourne while working in the factory. This attracted the attention of J. F. Archibald, editor of \"The Bulletin\". Acceptance of his writings allowed Dyson to leave the factory and earn his livelihood solely from his stories, verses, and paragraphs. His first real success came in 1889 when his short story \"A golden shanty\" was used as the title-piece in \"The Bulletin\"'s Christmas anthology. His play \"The golden shanty\" was first performed in Sydney on 30 August 1913, produced by Bert Bailey. The early 1890s also saw Dyson investing his savings into a weekly publication, \"The bull ant\", produced with later-member of parliament Randolph Bedford (1868–1941) and cartoon satirist Tom Durkin (1853–1902). A later libel case from a cartoon stopped any success. \n\nThe year 1893 saw Dyson side with Lawson in a poetry slam on Banjo Paterson's bush idealism, as part of the Bulletin Debate, where he submitted the poem 'The fact of the matter', which was later reworded and renamed 'The drovers in reply'. \n\nIn 1896 he published his only book of verse, a volume of poems, \"Rhymes from the mines and other lines\" and, in 1898, the first collection of his short stories, \"Below and on top\". The first book, Rhymes, was compared lesser with the recent first books of Paterson and Lawson, as his characters were not particularly Australian in identity and his broader humour. His writings today are one of the few recordings in verse of Australia's mining life (such as 'The trucker' and 'Cleaning up'). \n\nIn 1901, his first long story, \"The gold-stealers\", was published in London, which was followed by \"In the Roaring Fifties\" in 1906. In the same year appeared \"Fact'ry 'Ands\", a series of more or less connected sketches dealing with factory life in Melbourne in a vein of humour. This comedy was made into a stage production by 1916. \n\nVarious other stories and collections of stories were published in the Bookstall Series and will be found listed in Miller's bibliography of Australian literature. Another volume of verse, \"Hello, Soldier!\", appeared in mid-March 1919. It was to the point of publication in January 1919, a few months before Dyson's personal health significantly impacted his capability to work due to the global Spanish flu. The anthology was well received as showing 'his remarkable ability in seizing the soldier's point of view, and his dexterous use of language, plain and colored'.\n\nDyson was influenced by \"The Bulletin\" stable of writers – of which he also became – included Victor Daley, Lawson, and Paterson. It was said: \n\nIt was considered despite earnest work, his was a 'lesser talent' in comparison to Lawson and Paterson. Dyson also did not rank in the top twelve of the 1914 Melbourne's \"Herald\" ballot of Australia's one hundred and ten favourite poets. His writing style whilst generally humorous, farcical or with exaggeration, tended to be laboured. He credited artist Louis Bradley as his mentor, and Archibald as his 'Macaenas'. Through his life Dyson's contributions included the \"Ballarat Courier\", \"Tid-Bits\", \"Life\", \"Punch\", \"The Bulletin\", \"Age\", \"Argus\", \"Leader\", \"Antipodean\" and the \"Cosmos\".\n\nDyson did an enormous amount of work for many years until he broke down under the strain.\n\nIn 1896 aged 31, Dyson leapt into the Yarra River to save an individual's life, indicating the physique of the former miner. In 1914 aged 49, he married twenty-two-year-old Dorothy Boyes, who was described as 'one of the beauties of Melbourne, and has attained some prominence as a composer'. Boyes had previously put one of Dyson's works to music.\n\nBy 1923 Edward Dyson was feeling weakened from an appendicitis operation, which only added to his long illness resulting from the Australian 1919 influenza pandemic. His sister-in-law Ruby Lindsay, and an illustrator for his 1919 book, died during that global influenza outbreak on 12 March 1919. Dyson died, aged 66, at his home at 94 Tennyson Street, Saint Kilda, on Saturday 22 August 1931, and was cremated. His wife Dorothy survived him with their one daughter June, aged 14. With his passing it was noted: \n\nSome of his books were illustrated by his brother Will, a noted caricaturist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A Democrat, Maier was a powerful but controversial figure, presiding over an era of economic and political turbulence for the city of Milwaukee.\n\nMaier was born Henry Walter David Nelke in Dayton, Ohio. After his father died, he moved with his mother to Springfield, Ohio to live with his grandparents. He graduated from Springfield High School in 1936. When his mother moved to Milwaukee and married contractor Charles Maier, Nelke accompanied her. He changed his name to Henry Walter Maier in 1938.\n\nMaier served in the United States Navy during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and a master's degree from University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Maier was in the insurance business and taught workers' compensation and general liability insurance at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.\n\nA member of the Democratic Party, Maier was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1950. In 1960 he was elected Milwaukee's mayor, succeeding Frank Zeidler, the last of Milwaukee's Socialist mayors. Maier's term included the 1967 Milwaukee riot, a response by the African-American community to a host of issues including housing discrimination and police brutality (Maier's opposition to the Civil Rights Movement caused constant friction with his administration and Milwaukee's non-white residents). Maier remained in office for 28 years, succeeded by John Norquist in 1988. He was the longest-serving mayor in Milwaukee history.\n\nIn 1993, Maier wrote a political memoir: \"The Mayor Who Made Milwaukee Famous\". He died of pneumonia at age 76 at his home in Delafield, Wisconsin. The Henry Maier Festival Park, where Summerfest is held, was named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

Rather, the belt system is to be used as a navigational aid for motorists in unfamiliar portions of the county. Roads that make up the Belt System retain their previous names. The five original routes are, from outermost to innermost, the Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Blue Belts. The Purple Belt was not part of the original system and was added later.\n\nThe Allegheny County Belt System was developed in the late 1940s by Joseph White, an engineer with the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, as a wayfarer system using a network of federal, state, and municipal roads to offer residents alternative traffic patterns which did not lead to downtown Pittsburgh's congested Golden Triangle. As such, it actually predates the Interstate Highway System developed during the Eisenhower administration.\nFrom late 1951 to early 1952, the signs were posted throughout the finalized belt routes, starting with the Orange route, then Blue, Yellow, Red and Green.\n\nThe belt routes were not intended as high speed or limited access roads, but instead as a well-defined road system away from the existing major arterials and their congestion.\n\nThe construction of the interstate highway system and regional parkways during the late 1950s through the early 1970s initially reduced the use and need of the belt routes. As urbanization of the county spread further out from the City of Pittsburgh, however, the Belt System helped to reduce the effects of suburban congestion. Many of the roads selected over fifty years ago today play key roles in the long-range regional transportation plans of Allegheny County. Many of the roads chosen for the belts have been converted from simple country lanes to urban collector roads and to urban arterials.\nIn its millennium edition, \"Pittsburgh Magazine\" (published by WQED television) recognized White as one of the one hundred most influential people of the 20th century in the Pittsburgh region. Rick Sebak from WQED television also produced a local feature on the Allegheny County Belt System in the 1990s.\n\nThe City of Pittsburgh developed a Purple Belt for the downtown area during the mid-1990s using the county system as a guideline.\n\nA sign from the belt system is a featured Pittsburgh landmark on Yinztagram.\n\nAs of 2014, Pittsburgh does not have a true beltway, although the partially completed Southern Beltway is currently under construction as a partial beltway. Opponents of a full beltway have advocated residents to using the belt system, although some have stated that the city doesn't promote it enough and wonders why signage for it is still maintained.\n\nThe Belt System consists of six beltways. The Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red Belts travel distances of , , , , , and , respectively. The Purple, Blue, and Yellow belts are complete circular routes, beginning and ending at the same points. The Orange Belt was a complete circle until of the southernmost stretch (including its entire stretch through Washington County) was decommissioned in the 1970s to keep the belt system entirely in Allegheny County. It still briefly traverses Westmoreland County in New Kensington.\n\nPrior to its acquisition by the Chevron Corporation in 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation, with headquarters in Pittsburgh, published a map of Allegheny County prominently displaying the Belt System. Currently, Allegheny County produces maps featuring the Belt System.\n\nThe Red Belt is the outermost belt in the system. Unlike the other belts in the system, the Red Belt does not make a part of a complete loop—instead, it runs entirely east–west across the northernmost part of Allegheny County.\n\nThe current Red Belt is long and runs through largely rural communities. Going from west to east, it begins at the intersection of PA 65 and Cross Street in Leetsdale (just south of the Allegheny–Beaver County line) and ends at the intersection of PA 366 and East 7th Avenue in Tarentum. The Red Belt briefly enters Beaver County in two places where it crosses to the north bank of Big Sewickley Creek. Unlike other belts in the system, most of which access many state highways, the Red Belt only intersects numbered highways at its endpoints, along with US 19 in Marshall Township, PA 8 in Richland Township, and Interstate 79 just below Butler County. Much of the route is rural. The largest suburban sprawl along the route has occurred between US 19 and PA 8.\n\nBoth ends of the Red Belt originally ran outside of Allegheny County and were truncated to their current termini in 1974. As a result, it's the only belt in the system not to cross any of Allegheny County's main rivers.\n\nWestern end: Began at the PA 51 end of the Ambridge-Aliquippa Bridge in Aliquippa/Beaver County, ran across the bridge (Ohio River) to 11th Street in Ambridge, right on Duss Avenue, right on 8th Street, left on PA 65 South into Allegheny County, and left on Cross Street in Leetsdale where the current Red Belt begins eastbound\n\nEastern end: Began at the intersection of Leechburg and Freeport Roads at PA 366 in New Kensington/Westmoreland County and ran along PA 366 West, across the Tarentum Bridge (Allegheny River) into Allegheny County and continuing where the current Red Belt begins westbound\n\nThe Orange Belt is longest belt in the system, running . For most of its route, it is the outermost route in the system, except for the north of the county, where the Red Belt runs. The Orange Belt was originally a complete circle until a stretch in the south from Bethel Park to Forward Township was decommissioned (See \"decommissioned Orange Belt segment\" below).\n\nThe current Orange Belt runs through the northern, eastern, southern, and western sections of the county, connecting four county parks (including South Park and North Park) and the Pittsburgh International Airport. It stretches from its southwestern terminus at PA 88 in Bethel Park northwest to Moon Township and Sewickley , then northeast to Richland Township and West Deer Township, southeast to Plum and Monroeville , and finally southwest to its southeastern terminus at PA 51 in Elizabeth. Much of the route was previously rural, though suburban sprawl has placed it in many prominent commercial corridors.\n\nThe Orange Belt crosses or joins many Pennsylvania routes, including the entirety of PA 48, PA 50, PA 51, PA 56, PA 88, PA 366, PA 380, PA 910, and PA 978. It also crosses or joins Interstate 376 Business, I-376, US 22 and US 30 in two areas.\n\nOf the four major rivers in Allegheny County, the Orange Belt crosses three: Ohio River via Sewickley Bridge between Sewickley and Moon Township, Allegheny River via C.L. Schmitt Bridge between New Kensington and East Deer Township, and Youghiogheny River via Boston Bridge between Versailles and Elizabeth Township.\n\nFor , the Orange Belt briefly enters Westmoreland County from the C.L. Schmitt (New Kensington) Bridge to the county line on Logan's Ferry Road (formerly PA 909).\n\nThe original Orange Belt completed a circle by crossing into Washington County, but the southernmost stretch from Bethel Park to Forward Township, including the entire Washington County segment, was removed by early 1973 to keep the Belt system within the Allegheny County border (with the exceptions of the brief stretch of this belt in Westmoreland County and two short segments of the Red Belt in Beaver County).\n\nStarting at the intersection of Library and Clifton Roads in Bethel Park where the Orange Belt currently terminates from the southwest, the former segment begins at PA 88 South through Library and Finleyville (Washington County), then continues left onto Washington Avenue / Finleyville–Elrama Road, left onto PA 837 North (back into Allegheny County), and right onto PA 51 South for to the current southeastern terminus at PA 48 North.\n\nOriginally, the Orange and Yellow Belts were the only two in the system to cross all four major Allegheny County rivers. Today, only the latter carries that distinction as the former's decommissioned segment includes the crossing of the Monongahela River via Malady Bridge (PA 51) between Elizabeth and West Elizabeth.\n\nThe Yellow Belt is one of two belts, along with the Blue Belt, to make a complete loop around the city, over a distance of through the northern, eastern, southern, and western sectors of the county. For several miles in the southern part of the county, it is the outermost of the belts.\n\nThe Yellow Belt stretches from its southernmost point in South Park, north and west to the border of Moon, north and east to Hampton and West Deer, and east as far as the border to Penn Hills/Plum before returning to the start. It crosses or follows PA 50, PA 51, PA 60, PA 65, PA 88, PA 121, PA 130, PA 148, PA 380, PA 791, and PA 910. It also crosses or follows US 19 and US 22. It crosses the Neville Island Bridge and the Mansfield Bridge.\nUntil 2010, when PA 60 was renumbered I-376 beginning in Robinson Township (which includes a segment of the Orange Belt), the Yellow Belt had the distinction of being the only belt in the system with a segment situated on an Interstate Highway. Starting in Neville Township at Exit 65--Neville Island, the Yellow Belt runs concurrently along I-79 for four miles northbound to Exit 68--Mount Nebo Road along the border of Sewickley Hills and Ohio Township. \n\nCurry Hollow Road composes a part of the Yellow Belt to the south of Pittsburgh. It connects with Lebanon Church Road at Pennsylvania Route 51 in Pleasant Hills, Pennsylvania, connecting Clairton Boulevard (PA 51) with Broughton Road, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 88 and Bethel Church Road. Curry Hollow was a former town along this road, where it crosses the CSX railroad tracks next to Jefferson Memorial Park. East of PA 51, the Yellow Belt becomes Lebanon Church Road and crosses Pennsylvania Route 885 in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, connecting Clairton Boulevard (PA 51) with Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. The Allegheny County Airport is on the road. Both Curry Hollow Road and Lebanon Church Road are signed as SR 3048.\n\nThe Yellow Belt is also the only belt in the system to cross all four Allegheny County rivers: Ohio River via Coraopolis Bridge between Coraopolis and Neville Island, Monongahela River via Mansfield Bridge between Dravosburg and McKeesport, Youghiogheny River via Jerome Street Bridge in McKeesport and Allegheny River via Hulton Bridge between Harmar and Oakmont (The Orange Belt also had this distinction until its southernmost segment which crossed the Monongahela River was decommissioned)\n\nThe Green Belt forms a half-circle around the city, with a length of , through suburban communities in the northern and eastern sectors of the county. (The gap is due to geographic concerns rather than intersecting with other counties, as is the case with the Red and Orange Belts.)\nThe current Green Belt begins eastbound on Camp Horne Road at PA 65 in Emsworth and originally terminated before the Rankin Bridge in Rankin. This was later extended to its current southeastern terminus at PA 148 and the Yellow Belt in McKeesport, giving the Green Belt the distinctions of being the only one in the system to cross the same river (Monongahela) twice and terminate at another belt route. In its path around the city, the belt crosses or joins PA 8 (at its northernmost point in Hampton Township), PA 28, PA 65, PA 130, PA 148, and PA 837. It also briefly joins US 19 in Ross Township.\n\nThere are three Green Belt crossings over two of Allegheny County's four rivers. From the northeast, the belt traverses the Allegheny River via the Highland Park Bridge between O'Hara Township and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Highland Park. Traveling southeast, the Green Belt runs across the Monongahela River via Rankin Bridge between Rankin and Whitaker, down PA 837 South for 5 miles and across the Monongahela again via McKeesport-Duquesne Bridge (between said towns) where it terminates.\n\nThe Green Belt runs through many Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Its most notable landmark destinations include Kennywood Park in West Mifflin and the Pittsburgh Zoo in Pittsburgh's Highland Park neighborhood.\n\nThe Blue Belt is the innermost belt in the original system, making a complete circle around the city.\n\nThe current Blue Belt runs relatively close to skirting the border of the City of Pittsburgh on all sides, though it does make excursions into border towns such as Dormont and McKees Rocks. It generally serves urban communities in the northern, southern, and eastern sectors of the county. In its path around the city, the belt crosses or joins PA 8, PA 28, PA 51, PA 88, PA 121, and PA 837. It also briefly joins US 19. Only a small portion of the route (on PA 28) is a freeway. The Blue Belt crosses the Ohio River via McKees Rocks Bridge between McKees Rocks and the Brighton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Allegheny River via Highland Park Bridge between Sharpsburg and the Highland Park neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and Monongahela River via Homestead Grays Bridge between the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Squirrel Hill and Homestead. As of 2016, sections of the Blue Belt have been closed, marked one way, resigned and/or rerouted. Construction and traffic flow are the believed primary causes.\n\nFor one mile in northeastern Pittsburgh, the Blue and Green Belts form the only concurrent segment in the system. The two belts meet (Blue northbound, Green southbound) at the northern end of the Highland Park Bridge off Exit 6 on PA 28. From there, the dual Blue/Green Belt route runs across said bridge, around the loop onto Butler Street/PA 8 South and to the intersection of Allegheny River and Washington Boulevards where the belts split up. Here, the Blue Belt continues with a right-hand turn onto Washington Boulevard/PA 8 South and the Green Belt continues straight on Allegheny River Boulevard/PA 130 East.\n\nThe Purple Belt is the innermost colored belt in the system, running through downtown Pittsburgh. Unlike the other belts, it was established in 1995 in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Wayfinder System, a color-coded signage system downtown which helps tourists and locals find many of the common destinations in the city. (In the Wayfinder system, downtown destinations are colored purple. None of the other colors in that system correspond to the Belt System colors.) Thus, it uses a different style of signage than the other belts.\nUnlike the other belts, the Purple Belt's primary intent is not for navigation around the circumference of the city, but rather to assist in navigation downtown. It is also the only one of the belts to not leave the city at any point. Also, while signage for all of the other belts is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, the Purple Belt is maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Engineering and Construction.\n\nThe belt does not cross any numbered routes. It travels in a loop on four two-way streets—Stanwix Street, Fort Duquesne Boulevard/11th Street, Grant Street and Boulevard of the Allies. (In the counter-clockwise direction, it follows Smithfield Street and 4th Avenue to bypass the left turn from Boulevard of the Allies onto Grant Street, which is prohibited at certain times.) This lies inside the area bounded by the Allegheny River, Interstate 579, Interstate 376 and Interstate 279.\n\n\n"}

He married twice: in 1941 to Meri Mirjam Gyllenbögel, who died 1956 (they had one son and two daughters including the ballerina and choreographer Sorella Englund); and in 1958 he married , a singer, with whom he had one son.\n\nOne of the most important Finnish symphonists since Jean Sibelius, Englund was a native Swedish speaker who often felt that his career was sidelined from the mainstream of Finnish music.\n\nHe was 17 when he began studies at the Helsinki Conservatory (now the Sibelius Academy) in 1933. Already a considerable pianist, he continued his studies with Martti Paavola and Ernst Linko while studying composition with Bengt Carlson and Selim Palmgren.\nFollowing his graduation in 1941, Englund was conscripted into military service. During his time in the Finnish Continuation War he was wounded in his hand, which almost brought to an end his hopes of pursuing a career as a concert pianist. He would often recall the bizarre, though life-threatening incident, with a smile.\n\nEnglund's first work for large orchestra was his First Symphony (1946), which became known as the \"War Symphony\". This was no apprentice piece; the use of counterpoint, dissonance and orchestration of singular clarity reveals a master at work. His Second Symphony, the \"Blackbird Symphony\", soon followed the first.\n\nIn 1949 Englund was awarded a grant to study in the United States with Aaron Copland, and he also played jazz with Leonard Bernstein. It has been suggested that Englund's study with the American master consisted of discussions about music and composition, Copland having realised that there was little he could teach the younger man.\n\nThroughout the 1950s he produced a series of large-scale works including \"Sinuhe\", a ballet (1953) originally for piano though later orchestrated, and \"Odysseus\" (1959), written for the Swedish dancer and choreographer Brigit Cullberg, a Cello Concerto (1954) and the First Piano Concerto (1955), as well as film scores and incidental music. His score for Erik Blomberg’s \"Valkoinen peura\" (The White Reindeer), which won a Jussi Award (the Finnish Oscar), and his score for Max Frisch’s play \"The Great Wall of China\" are particularly notable.\n\nHe composed music for twenty films, as well as works for choir including the \"Hymnus Sepulcralis\" (1975).\n\nDuring the 1950s, with his second wife, the singer Maynie Sirén, he performed a cabaret act; he was music critic of the Swedish-language \"Hufvudstadsbladet\", and he taught at the Sibelius Academy from 1958 until 1982.\n\nHis Third Symphony (1971) appeared 23 years after his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his Fourth (1976) and Fifth Symphonies (1977) and the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981).\n\nEnglund’s Sixth Symphony (1984), subtitled \"Aphorisms\", is in six movements for chorus and orchestra; his last symphony, the Seventh, was composed in 1988, coinciding with the onset of the heart disease that signalled a decline in health and would ultimately lead to his death. His Clarinet Concerto of 1991 was completed shortly before a stroke rendered further composition physically impossible. Later he suffered from kidney failure, which necessitated dialysis for the remainder of his life.\n\nEnglund also composed chamber music, including a suite for solo cello and a sonata for cello and piano; there are also works for violin and piano, solo trombone, and solo piano.\n\nHis memoirs, \"I Skuggan av Sibelius\" (In the Shadow of Sibelius), were published in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the French-language counterpart of CBC Television, the broadcaster's English-language television network.\n\nIts headquarters are at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal, which is also home to the network's flagship station, CBFT-DT. Until the 2012 closedown of the CBC / Radio-Canada rebroadcaster network, it was the only francophone network in Canada to broadcast terrestrially in all Canadian provinces.\n\nThis network is considered more populist than CBC Television. It does not face such intense competition from American networks. Despite this, it has trailed TVA in the ratings for most of the last 30 years, roughly as long as its English counterpart has trailed CTV. Its ratings have improved with offbeat sitcoms, and the talk show \"Tout le monde en parle.\" With this success, however, have come accusations of dumbing down. For instance, \"Tout le monde en parle\" replaced the long-running Sunday night arts series \"Les Beaux Dimanches\".\n\nNews programming is anchored by \"Le Téléjournal\", which airs nightly at 10:00 p.m. Local newscasts, which air during the lunch and supper hours, now also carry the \"Téléjournal\" name, i.e., \"Le Téléjournal Montréal\". The regional newscasts used to be called \"Ce Soir (This Evening)\".\n\nAll Radio-Canada newscasts are broadcast under the name \"Le Téléjournal\". The main evening broadcast airs most nights at 10:00 p.m. local time (11:00 p.m. in the Maritimes). \"Le Téléjournal\" is also seen live and as a repeat broadcast on sister cable news channel RDI and on time-delay worldwide via international francophone channel TV5. There are no morning newscasts. Local and regional news also takes the \"Téléjournal\" name followed by the name of a city, region or province, or by the time of day (for example \"Le Téléjournal Montréal\", \"Le Téléjournal Midi\", etc.) CBVT-DT Quebec City, CBLFT-DT Toronto and CBOFT-DT Ottawa, and CBAFT-DT in the Atlantic provinces run local midday bulletins whilst all affiliates run supper-hour bulletins which run from Monday to Fridays, with the exception of CBVT-DT, CBOFT-DT and CBAFT-DT, which run seven days a week.\n\nInvestigative reporting is broadcast weekly as \"Enquête\". In 2008, the program tested the safety levels of Tasers in the wake of concerns raised after a Polish immigrant died after RCMP police officers fired a Taser in Vancouver International Airport. Other shows such as \"Découverte\" raised concerns about the safety of overhead bridges in Montreal after the collapse of a bridge in 2007.\n\nThere is also weekly programming on political affairs concerning the National Assembly of Quebec and the House of Commons of Canada with \"Les coulisses du pouvoir\" (The Corridors of Power). Science and technology issues are covered in \"Découverte\" and agricultural and rural topics in \"La semaine verte\". Consumer affairs are covered in \"L'épicerie\" and \"Facture\".\n\nFrom 1952 to 2004, the network was home to weekly French-language broadcasts of ice hockey matches involving the Montreal Canadiens, called \"La Soirée du hockey\". The show was discontinued when broadcast rights reverted to RDS. Viewers outside Quebec were able to continue watching games via Radio-Canada stations until 2006 when RDS became exclusive broadcasters. Radio-Canada were also the home of the Montreal Alouettes before moving also to RDS. It was also home for many years to French-language television broadcasts of the Montreal Expos.\n\nAfter briefly losing the rights to V and RDS as part of the CTV/Rogers consortium, CBC/Radio-Canada re-gained rights to the Olympic Games in 2014, with Radio-Canada as main French-language broadcaster.

Laflaque\" and dramas such as \"Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin\", \"Virginie\" and \"Tout sur moi\".\n\n\"Tout le monde en parle\" in particular is a long running talk show imported from the same show of the same name in France and has featured high-profile guests, such as Julie Couillard and former Action démocratique du Québec leader Mario Dumont. A weekly music show called \"Studio 12\" makes an appearance on Sundays.\n\nAlthough the bulk of the prime-time schedule is Quebec-produced, a few dubbed shows from the US have also aired in prime-time, such as \"Perdus\", \"Beautées désepérées\", and \"Chère Betty\".\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Radio-Canada presents a live comedy special, \"Bye Bye\", which features musical and comedy guests, performing live.\n\n\nNon-news regional programming is usually programmed for broadcast on weekends. It is limited to arts and culture and typically airs outside Quebec, especially in Acadia and the Western provinces. For example, \"Zeste\" broadcasts on stations in the Western provinces on Saturday early evenings, while \"Luc et Luc\" airs Sunday evenings in the Maritimes.\n\nOf Canada's three major French-language television networks, Radio-Canada was the only one that, until 2012, broadcast terrestrially in all Canadian provinces. With the exception of Atlantic Canada, where a single station serves all four provinces, the network has at least one originating station in every province. These stations serve every major market in French and English Canada, with privately owned affiliates serving smaller markets in Quebec.\n\nUnlike CBC Television affiliates, which often have several alternative programming sources, Radio-Canada affiliates are effectively constrained to carry network programming throughout the day in pattern with no preemptions. The only exceptions are for local and regional programming and commercials.\n\nIn 2007, Radio-Canada announced its intention to terminate its long-time affiliation with three regional affiliates in Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières, and Saguenay. These stations were owned by Cogeco, at the time a majority owner of commercial rival TQS (now V). By the end of the year, TQS had filed for bankruptcy; as part of exiting bankruptcy, a deal was announced the following spring for Radio-Canada to directly acquire the stations. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on June 26, 2008. Only the stations in Rouyn-Noranda (CKRN-DT, which closed in 2018) and Rivière-du-Loup (CKRT-DT) remained as private affiliates, rather than owned-and-operated stations.\n\nOn February 27, 2009 CBC/Radio-Canada President Hubert Lacroix admitted at the Empire Club of Canada that the corporation is facing a budget shortfall and as a result some services may be forced to close down and/or stations merged or sold off, saying:\n\n\"\"La crise économique nous force à revoir toutes les facettes de nos activités.\"(\"The economic crisis forced us to review all facets of our activities.\")\"\nIt is not yet clear how the announcement will affect stations owned by either CBC Television or Télévision de Radio-Canada, however it is envisaged that regional news programming may be merged in the regions outside Quebec.\n\nRadio-Canada once operated an extensive network of rebroadcasters, but they were closed by 2012.\n\nSRC converted its originating station transmitters to digital as part of the digital transition deadline in mandatory markets, which took place on August 31, 2011.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, all of the corporation's 620 analog television transmitters were permanently shut down, leaving CBC's English and French television network with a total of 27 digital transmitters.\n\nFor most of its history, the network was branded as \"Radio-Canada.\" In television listings such as \"TV Guide\" or \"TV Hebdo\", where space limitations usually require television networks to be referred to by a three-letter abbreviation; while its full name was previously Télévision de Radio-Canada, the network was normally coded as SRC (for Société Radio-Canada, the French language corporate name of the CBC as a whole). While the network experimented with using SRC as its on-air brand in the 1990s, within a few months it reverted to using \"Radio-Canada\" for nearly all verbal references. The experiment ended later in the decade. In 2009 Radio-Canada refreshed its branding featuring the word \"Télévision\" underneath the corporate logo; in promos, it features the logo, without any wording or slogans.\n\nOn June 5, 2013, it was announced that as part of an overall effort to unify CBC's French-language platforms and outlets under a common name, Télévision de Radio-Canada was to be renamed Ici Télé on September 9, 2013—a nod to its longtime system cue dating back to the 1930s on radio, \"Ici Radio-Canada\" (This is Radio-Canada). The re-branding was panned by critics and politicians, who felt that the new brand was too confusing, and criticized the CBC's plans to downplay the historic \"Radio-Canada\" name as a viewer-facing brand, along with the reported $400,000 cost of the new campaign in the midst of budget cuts. In response to the criticism, Hubert Lacroix announced a compromise, where the Radio-Canada name would be added to the revised branding, resulting in Ici Radio-Canada Télé as its official name.\n\n\nThe ombudsman of Radio-Canada has been Pierre Tourangeau since July 2011. He was preceded by Julie Miville-Dechêne (2007–2011) Renaud Gilbert (2000–2007), Marcel Pépin (1997–1999), Mario Cardinal (1993–1997) and Bruno Gauron (1992).\n\nOn March 5, 2005, Télévision de Radio-Canada launched an HD simulcast of its Montreal station CBFT-DT. Since that time they have also launched HD simulcasts in Quebec City (CBVT-DT), Ottawa (CBOFT-DT), Toronto (CBLFT-DT) and Vancouver (CBUFT-DT). The HD feed is available through both pay television services, and through ATSC digital terrestrial television on the following channels:\n\n\nOn September 10, 2007, the network (as well as sister cable news network RDI) began broadcasting all programming solely in the aspect ratio with few exceptions, and began letterboxing its widescreen feed for standard definition viewers.\n\nCertain shows such as \"Virginie\" and \"Le Téléjournal\" are carried on international francophone channel TV5MONDE.\n\nAs with CBC Television, Ici Télé stations can be viewed over-the-air in the northern United States including the border areas of eastern Maine via CBAFT-DT Moncton or CKRT-DT Rivière-du-Loup; northern and central New England via CKSH-DT Sherbrooke; the border areas of New York State and Vermont via CBFT-DT Montreal, CBOFT-DT Ottawa-Gatineau or CBLFT-DT Toronto; or in northwest Washington via CBUFT-DT Vancouver.\n\n"}
{"id": "2153677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153677", "title": "Bulk tank", "text": "Bulk tank\n\nIn dairy farming a bulk milk cooling tank is a large storage tank for cooling and holding milk at a cold temperature until it can be picked up by a milk hauler. \nThe bulk milk cooling tank is an important piece of dairy farm equipment. It is usually made of stainless steel and used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition. It must be cleaned after each milk collection. \nThe milk cooling tank can be the property of the farmer or be rented from a dairy plant.\n\nRaw milk producers have a choice of either open (from 150 to 3000 litres) or closed (from 1000 to 10000 litres) tanks. The cost can vary considerably, depending on manufacturing norms and whether a new or second hand tank is purchased.\n\nMilk silos (10,000 litres and plus) are suitable for the very large producer. These are designed to be installed outside and adjacent to the dairy, all controls and the milk outlet pipe being situated in the dairy.\n\nA milk cooling tank, also known as a bulk tank or milk cooler, consists of an inner and an outer tank, both made of high quality stainless steel.\n\nThe space between the outer tank and the inner tank is isolated with polyurethane foam. In case of a power failure with an outside temperature of 30°C, the content of the tank will warm up only 1°C in 24 hours.\n\nTo facilitate an adequate and rapid cooling of the entire content of a tank, every tank is equipped with at least one agitator. Stirring the milk ensures that all milk inside the tank is of the same temperature and that the milk stays homogeneous.\n\nOn top of every closed milk cooling tank is a manhole of about 40 centimetres diameter. This enables thorough cleaning and inspection of the inner tank if necessary. The manhole is covered by a lid and sealed watertight with a rubber ring. Also on top are 2 or 3 small inlets. One is covered with an air-vent, the other(s) can be used to pump milk into the tank.\n\nA milk cooling tank usually stands on 4, 6, or 8 adjustable legs. The built-in tilt of the inner tank ensures that even the last drop of milk will eventually flow to the outlet.\n\nAt the bottom, every milk cooling tank has a threaded outlet, usually including a valve.\n\nAll tanks have a thermometer, allowing for immediate inspection of the inner temperature.\n\nMost tanks include an automatic cleaning system. Using hot and cold water, an acid and/or alkaline cleaning fluid, a pump and a spray lance will clean the inner tank, ensuring an hygienic inner environment each time the tank is emptied.\n\nAlmost every tank has a control box. It manages the cooling process by use of a thermostat. The user can turn the system on and off, allow for extra and immediate stirring, start the cleaning routine, and reset the entire system in case of a failure.\n\nNew and bigger milk cooling tanks are now being equipped with monitoring and alarm systems. These systems guard temperature of the milk inside the tank, check the functioning of the agitator, the cooling unit and temperature of the cleaning water. In case of malfunctioning of any of these functions, the alarm will activate. The monitoring system will also keep a record of the temperature and of all malfunctions for a given period. \n\nNorms define among other criteria: insulation, milk agitation, cooling power required, variations in milk quantity measurement, calibration, … Some are more demanding than others.\n\n\nSwedish outlet (SMS 1145), German outlet (DIN 11851), English RJT (BS 4825), IDF (ISO 2853), tri-clamp (ISO 2852), Danish outlet (DS 722), ... can be found, not to mention different diameters. They vary from country to country. Non standard outlets make the milk collection process difficult, as the operator needs to adapt to each different standard/diameter.\n\nThere are two primary methods of cooling milk entering the bulk tank, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The tank capacity and type will depend on herd size, calving pattern, frequency of milk collection, required milk quality, energy and water availability and future plans for development. \n\nA bulk tank with direct expansion cooling has pipes or pillow plates carrying refrigerant which are welded directly to the exterior of the milk chamber. A layer of insulation covers the exterior of the milk tank and the cooling lines, with an exterior metal shell over the insulation. \n\nDirect expansion cooling cannot run when the tank is empty or the inside walls of the tank would freeze. Instead, the tank is rapidly cooled as warm milk first enters the tank, and then the tank is cooled slowly just to maintain a low storage temperature. The rapid cooling during milking requires very large refrigeration compressors and condenser radiators to quickly expel heat from the milk, and is better suited for very large farming operations where three-phase electric power is available to operate the high-power cooling system.\n\nA bulk tank using an Ice Builder or Ice Bank immerses the bottom of the inner milk chamber in an open pool of water with copper tubes containing refrigerant suspended in the water. Between milkings, a small low-power cooling system slowly builds up a coating of ice around the copper tubes, and prevents icing of the pool over by continuously circulating the water in the pool. After the ice has achieved a thickness of 2-3 inches, the cooling system stops running.\n\nDuring milking, the milk entering the tank is primarily cooled by circulating the water in the pool around the walls of the inner milk chamber, and the melting of the ice. After the ice has melted sufficiently the cooling system restarts to assist the ice bank and restart the ice building. \n\nIce bank bulk tanks are better suited for small family farm operations where only single-phase electric power is available, and high-power cooling systems would be either too expensive or difficult to install.\n\nFor energy savings and quality reasons it is advisable to pre-cool the milk before it enters the tank using a plate or a tube cooler (shell and tube heat exchanger) supplied with chilled water from the well water, the ice builder or the condensing unit. The quicker milk is cooled after leaving the cow the better. This system achieves most of the cooling before the milk enters the tank, so that chilled milk, rather than warm milk, is being added to the already cooled milk in the tank.\n\nGeneric temperature for milk storage is 3 to 4°C. For raw milk cheese manufacturing, it would be advisable to keep the milk at 12°C, as milk characteristics will be kept in a better state.\n\nThe milk cooling tank is usually not completely filled at once. A 2 milking tank is designed to cool 50% of its capacity at once. A 4 milking tank is designed to cool 25% of its capacity at once, and a 6 milking tank is designed to cool 16.7% of its capacity at once.\n\nThe cooling performance depends on the number of milking it takes to completely fill the tank, the ambient temperature and the cooling time.\n\nThere are two primary methods of cleaning bulk tanks, via manual scrubbing or automatic washing. Both methods generally use four steps to clean the tank:\n\nManual scrubbing requires the bulk tank to have large hinged covers that can be lifted open to permit easy access to the interior surfaces of the tank. It tends to be much more thorough than automatic methods since it permits the tank to be carefully inspected during the washing process. If the tank is not found to be cleaned well enough, a troublesome area can be given additional cleansing attention. \n\nThis job is difficult to perform for very large tanks, and becomes more difficult as the overall cross-section or diameter of the tank increases, requiring either a longer brush or a raised work platform around the tank to lift the cleaning worker to reach over the side of a tall tank.\n\nAutomatic bulk tank washing and are normally activated by the milk collection truck driver after each milk collection. The cleaning system operates similar to a consumer dishwasher and consists of one or more free-spinning high-pressure spray nozzles with tangential jets, with the spray nozzle mounted on the end of a flexible whip suspended down into the center of the interior. As the cleaning solution sprays out of the jet, the force of the expelled water causes the jet to spin around and the whip to wildly swing back and forth, spraying the cleaning solution randomly all over the interior of the tank.\n\nBecause no physical scrubbing occurs with automatic wash systems, the cleanser relies on surfactants and detergents to dissolve the fats left on the interior of the tank by the cream in the milk. However, this is not sufficient to remove milkstone buildup, and the tank may need to be washed occasionally with milkstone remover to remove this scale buildup that can harbor bacteria and contaminants.\n\nAutomatic scrubbing only cleans the interior of the tank. It is not capable of cleaning the exterior of the tank, and it does not do a good job of washing around the cover seals. While it is possible to just clean the interior and call it good enough, it does not provide the maximum sanitation of manually washing down the exterior of the tank following or during the automatic wash process. Also, some components that contact the milk such as the drain valve cannot be properly cleaned automatically without disassembling the valve and retaining washer and directly scrubbing in soapy water.\n\nSubstantial reductions in running costs can be made when an ice builder is used in conjunction with off-peak electricity. Pre-cooling milk using a plate or a tube cooler supplied with mains or well water can also reduce costs and add to the cooling capacity of the tank.\n\nBulk tank condenser units, which are not an integral part of the tank, should be fitted in an adjacent, suitable and well ventilated place. \n\nIf at all possible, condenser units should not be fitted on a wall facing the sun. They should be installed in a way which allows them to draw in and discharge adequate quantities of air for efficient operation.\n\nBulk tank should be easily accessible by large bulk collection tankers and positioned so that the tanker approaches can be kept clean and free from cow traffic at all times.\n\nAlthough tanks have been calibrated when first installed, bulk tank miscalibration is not uncommon and in some cases it can result in significant loss of income. Milk tanks calibrated on the low side, can cheat raw milk producers by up to 22 litres on each shipment. It is therefore advisable to re-calibrate a bulk tank.\n\nStainless steel bulk tanks are also used to heat or cool a fluid or simply to keep it isolated and warm/cold. Because of the hygienical finishing of the inner and outer side of the tanks, almost any fluid can be stored: water, fruit juices, honey, wine, beer, ink, paint, cosmetics, aromatic food-additives, bacterial cultures, cleansers, oil, or blood.\n\n"}
{"id": "2153682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153682", "title": "KEZE", "text": "KEZE\n\nKEZE (96.9 MHz \"Hot 96.9\") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Spokane, Washington. It is owned by Morgan Murphy Media, with the license held by QueenB Radio, and it airs a rhythmic contemporary radio format.\n\nThe studios and offices are on West Boone Avenue in Spokane. The transmitter is located in the Antoine Peak Conservation Area in Otis Orchards, Washington.\n\nOn Christmas Day, 1992, the station signed on as 96.9 KSPO. It was owned by Melinda Boucher Read and it aired a Christian radio format. It also carried news from the Mutual Broadcasting System. In an era where few women were in charge at radio stations, Read served as the general manager and CEO of the station. \n\nOn March 4, 1996, KSPO moved to 106.5 FM, clearing 96.9 for KEZE to take over the frequency. KSPO is now the flagship station for the \"American Christian Network.\"\n\nThe KEZE call sign started out in 1979 at 105.7 MHz, using the identification \"KEZE, E-Z listening.\" It aired beautiful music. In 1979, KEZE-FM was acquired by Kaye-Smith Enterprises. \n\nKaye-Smith already owned Top 40 AM 790 KJRB, so the FM station flipped to a format that would also bring in young listeners, album-oriented rock. KEZE called itself \"Rock 106 - Spokane's Best Rock.\" In 1989, KJRB and KEZE were acquired by Apollo Broadcasting. Under Apollo, KEZE leaned more toward active rock, with plenty of harder-edged rock acts on its playlist. Some of the core artists include Led Zeppelin, Night Ranger, The Rolling Stones, Ozzy Osbourne, and Def Leppard. \n\nWith the emergence of grunge and \"the Seattle sound\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, KEZE adopted heavy guitar-based alternative rock, including Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Nirvana. On October 20, 1995, the station moved to adult album alternative (AAA) as KAEP, \"105.7 the Peak\".\n\nThe rock format and KEZE call letters moved to 96.9 FM on March 4, 1996. As the public appeal of guitar-based alternative waned in the mid-'90s, KEZE attempted a \"back to our roots\" campaign as a classic rock station in 1996. Classic rock lasted about three years. In March 1999, KEZE flipped to an all-1980s hits format, known as \"Star @ 96-9.\" \n\nIn 2003, KEZE began adding some 1990's music. In 2004, it evolved to an Adult Top 40 format. The morning show on the station was well-known local hosts \"The Breakfast Boys,\" Dave Sposito and Ken Hopkins. They are now on sister station KZZU-FM.\n\nOn October 12, 2005, the station flipped to Rhythmic Top 40, a move that might have been spurred by rumors that another station might move into the Spokane radio market to fill the void after KYWL dropped the rhythmic format in 2004. Those rumors became reality in December 2005 when KQQB signed on with the same format as KEZE's, even though KEZE had an advantage over KQQB in terms of signal coverage of Spokane County. KQQB evolved into a Mainstream Top 40 direction, thus leaving KEZE as the only Rhythmic Contemporary station in the market. \n\nDuring this time, KEZE was known as \"Wired 96-9\" with the slogan \"Blazin' Today's Hottest Music!\" It was Spokane's home for the Portland based morning show The Playhouse. Wired was a generally successful station. However, ratings began to decline in early 2008.\n\nOn November 20, 2008, KEZE began playing Christmas music. This format change to Christmas music left Spokane without a Rhythmic Top 40 station. It also led to speculation that when the holidays ended, KEZE would switch to another format. The holiday music continued through Christmas Eve of that year.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2008, KEZE switched to country music, branding itself as \"Coyote Country.\" This made KEZE the fourth station in the Spokane area to broadcast a country format on the FM band, along with KDRK \"The Cat,\" KIXZ-FM \"KIX 96\" and KICR \"K102 Country.\" Shortly after the flip, KEZE's ratings improved, despite the four-way competition.\n\nOn May 15, 2009, Coyote Country added \"The Jay and Kevin Show\" in morning drive time. Jay and Kevin had previously aired on \"The Cat\" KDRK for 11 years. Jay and Kevin were joined by Sean \"Slim\" Widmer, formerly of \"Spokane's Sports Show\", as their producer.\n\nOn January 1, 2010, KEZE's owner, Morgan Murphy, switched formats on two of its Spokane stations, KEZE and KXLY-FM. It moved the Coyote Country format to 99.9, while KXLY-FM's modestly successful AAA format took over 96.9 as \"The River.\" On November 12, 2010, the station flipped to all-Christmas, making it the second time in the station's history that 96.9 has switched to Christmas music. \n\nThe AAA format returned after the holidays. But after the temporary holiday music phase, it was obvious that the Morgan Murphy/Spokane management had not found a successful formula for bringing the station decent ratings. \n\nOn April 20, 2011, station management announced that KEZE would return to a Rhythmic Top 40 format. It had already set up Facebook and Twitter accounts ahead of the switch, which revealed the station's new logo and moniker. \n\nOn May 4, 2011, at 3:05 p.m., \"The River\" signed off with \"Tree by the River\" by Iron and Wine. The station then launched \"Hot 96.9\" with \"Roll Up\" by Wiz Khalifa. (The River continues online at .) With the return to Rhythmic Contemporary, KEZE faced another Rhythmic station, 104.5 KGZG, whose signal coverage requires a booster in Spokane (and who responded to KEZE's switch by setting up a website called \"Not969.com\" to direct listeners to its station.) Since its return to Rhythmic, KEZE has seen its two competitors, KGZG and KPXR-FM, leave the format in 2014: KGZG went dark on April 7, 2014, (and would later return as KNHK-FM), and KPXR dropped Top 40/CHR to return to Country on May 8, and later as Alternative KFOO-FM. With those flips, KEZE became the market's only Rhythmic Contemporary outlet.\n"}
{"id": "2153683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153683", "title": "Tallink", "text": "Tallink\n\nTallink () is an Estonian shipping company operating Baltic Sea cruiseferries and ropax ships from Estonia to Finland, Estonia to Sweden, Latvia to Sweden and Finland to Sweden. It is the largest passenger and cargo shipping company in the Baltic Sea region. It owns Silja Line and a part of SeaRail. Tallink Hotels runs four hotels in Tallinn and one in Riga. It is also the co-owner of a taxi company Tallink Takso.\n\nIt is a publicly traded company, that is listed in Tallinn Stock Exchange. Major shareholder is an investment company AS Infortar, that also has ownership in several Tallink subsidiaries and a natural gas company Eesti Gaas.\n\nThe history of the company known today as Tallink can be traced back to 1965 when the Soviet Union-based Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) introduced passenger ferry services between Helsinki and Tallinn on . Regular around-the-year passenger ferry services began in 1968 on MS \"Tallinn\", which served the route until it was replaced by the new in 1980.\n\nIn May 1989 ESCO formed a new subsidiary, joint venture () Tallink, together with the Finnish Palkkiyhtymä Oy. In December of the same year ESCO and Palkkiyhtymä purchased MS \"Scandinavian Sky\" from SeaEscape, and the ship began traffic on the Helsinki–Tallinn route in January 1990 as . Later in the same year the freighter joined the \"Tallink\" on the Helsinki–Tallinn route and Tallink was established as the name of the company as well as the main ship. At the same time ESCO still operated the \"Georg Ots\" in the same route, essentially competing with its own daughter company. This conflict was resolved in September 1991 when the \"Georg Ots\" was chartered to Tallink. In the early 1990s passenger numbers on Helsinki–Tallinn traffic were steadily increasing, and during winters between 1992 and 1995 Tallink chartered from Irish Ferries to increase capacity on the route.\n\nTallink became a fully Estonian-owned company in 1993 when Palkkiyhtymä sold its shares of both the Tallink company and MS \"Tallink\" to ESCO. At this time other companies were establishing themselves on the lucrative Helsinki–Tallinn traffic, including the Estonian New Line, owned by the Tallinn-based Inreko. ESCO and Inreko saw no sense in competing with each other and in January 1994 Tallink and Inreko Laeva AS were merged into AS Eminre. Tallink remained the marketing name for the company's fleet. Later in the same year Inreko purchased MS \"Nord Estonia\" from EstLine (a daughter company of ESCO and the Swedish Nordström & Thulin), renamed her and placed her in Helsinki–Tallinn traffic for Tallink. Inreko also brought with them two fast hydrofoils, HS \"Liisa\" and HS \"Laura\" which began serving under the Tallink Express brand. In 1994 Tallink also attempted traffic from Estonia to Germany for the first time, with two chartered ferries and that were placed on the route Helsinki–Tallinn–Travemünde.\n\nIn September 1994 AS Eminre's operations were divided into two companies, one that took care of the traffic to Germany (which was soon closed down) and AS Hansatee which took the Helsinki–Tallinn traffic and the Tallink name. ESCO was the dominant partner in Hansatee, controlling 45% of the shares, whereas Inreko owned only 12.75% (the remaining 42.25% belonging to Eesti Ühispank, Estonia). In 1995 Hansatee brought the first large ferry into Helsinki–Tallinn traffic when they chartered MS \"Mare Balticum\" from EstLine and renamed her . Following various disputes between ESCO and Inreko (most notably about the charter price of \"Vana Tallinn\"), Inreko sold their shares of AS Hansatee to ESCO in December 1996. At the same time Inreko sold the Tallink Express hydrofoils to Linda Line, Estonia, and begun operating the \"Vana Tallinn\" on Helsinki–Tallinn traffic under the name TH Ferries.\n\nIn 1997 a second large ferry was brought to Tallink's traffic when the company chartered from Stena Line. To replace the lost hydrofoils, Hansatee purchased a new express catamaran in May 1997, which was named . At this time it was clear that two large ferries were needed for traffic between Helsinki and Tallinn, and when the \"Normandy\"s charter ended in December 1997 Tallink purchased MS \"Lion King\" from Stena Line, which entered traffic in February 1998 as . In July of the same year Tallink purchased the freighter which opened a line from Paldiski to Kapellskär, Tallink's first route to Sweden. In October the original MS \"Tallink\", which no longer conformed modern safety regulations, was sold. Two months later Hansatee purchased their first fast ferry capable of carrying cars, .\n\nBy the year 2000 ESCO had become the sole owner of EstLine, and in December 2000 EstLine's two ferries and were chartered to Hansatee, and the line between Tallinn and Stockholm began to be marketed as a part of Tallink. A few months earlier, in August 2000, Hansatee had ordered their first newbuild from the Finnish Aker Finnyards. In June 2001 Tallink purchased , while next month EstLine was declared bankrupt.\n\nIn 2002 AS Hansatee changed its name to AS Tallink Grupp, and in May of the same year the company took delivery of the brand new 2500-passenger cruiseferry , which was placed on Helsinki–Tallinn traffic. In November of the same year the classic \"Georg Ots\" was sold to the government of Russia. In 2004 three news ships joined Tallink's fleet, and alongside the \"Romantika\"s sister which was placed on Tallinn–Stockholm route, replacing MS \"Fantaasia\" which in turn started a new route from Helsinki to St. Petersburg via Tallinn. This route proved unprofitable and was terminated in January 2005. Later in 2005 Tallink ordered a sister ship of the to-be delivered and a fast ropax ferry from Aker Finnyards as well as another ropax ferry from the Fincantieri yard in Italy. On December 9, 2005, Tallink was listed at Tallinn Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2006, Tallink purchased the Baltic Sea operations of Superfast Ferries from Attica Group, opened a route between Riga and Stockholm (with MS \"Fantaasia\", which was within a month replaced by MS \"Regina Baltica\"), took delivery of the new which replaced \"Romantika\" on the Tallinn–Helsinki route, transferred \"Romantika\" to the Tallinn–Stockholm route, and withdrew \"AutoExpress\" from service. A few months later, the company purchased the rival Finnish passenger line Silja Line from Sea Containers. In October 2006, the company expressed an interest in making an offer to operate ferries on the state-subsidized routes between the Swedish island of Gotland and the Swedish mainland between 2009 and 2015.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2007, the former Superfast ships were moved under the Tallink brand and their route changed to Tallinn–Helsinki–Rostock. In April of the same year, Aker Yards delivered the fast cruiseferry that had been ordered in 2005. With the delivery of the \"Star\", \"Meloodia\" was chartered to Balearic Islands, Spain for ten months and later sold, while \"AutoExpress 3\" and \"AutoExpress 4\" were also withdrawn. During April 2007 Tallink also ordered a third \"Galaxy\"-class cruiseferry from Aker Yards.\n\nTwo new ships followed in 2008, with the fast cruiseferry delivered from Fincantieri and the second \"Galaxy\"-class ship, , delivered from Aker Yards. Both ships were placed in service between Helsinki and Tallinn With the delivery of the former, the last AutoExpress fast craft, \"AutoExpress 2\", was withdrawn from Helsinki–Tallinn service. \"Baltic Princess\", meanwhile, replaced her sister ship \"Galaxy\", which was transferred to the fleet of Silja Line. With the arrival of \"Galaxy\" was left without employment in the Silja fleet, and she was in turn transferred to Tallink's fleet, joining \"Regina Baltica\" on the Riga–Stockholm service. In November 2008, , one of three ships purchased from Superfast Ferries in 2006, was chartered to the Canadian Marine Atlantic ferry operator for five years. In April 2009, Tallink took delivery of its last newbuilding (as of 2010), when was delivered STX Europe (the former Aker Yards). The new ship was placed on the Tallinn–Mariehamn–Stockholm service alongside \"Victoria I\". \"Romantika\", that had been \"Victoria I\"s running mate since 2006, was in turn transferred to the Riga–Stockholm route, where she replaced \"Regina Baltica\" that was in turn chartered out to Acciona Trasmediterránea.\n\nIn December 2009, it was reported that company was struggling to repay its debts of 1.1 billion euros. The fiscal year ending in August resulted in an operating loss, and the company had to re-negotiate with its 15 funding banks debt repayment schedules for the years 2009–2011. The banks took a more controlling role in the company: it could no longer pay dividends, make investments, or sign new contracts without its creditors' approval. Tallink also had to pick up the pace in debt repayments if conditions were to improve, and had to look for options to sell or rent some of its ships. Most of its debts were incurred for purchasing Silja Line for 470 million and Superfast Ferries for 310 million euros.\n\nIn November 2009, Tallink temporarily withdrew and from the Germany–Finland service. The ships spent the winter of 2009–2010 laid up in Kopli, before re-commencing service between Helsinki and Rostock in April 2010.\n\nIn March 2011, it was confirmed that the and have been chartered to Stena Line for a period of three years, with the option to extend the charter for another year. Stena Line will use these ships for Scotland-Northern Ireland service. The vessels will be delivered after the end of the high season in August 2011. Until then they are operated on their current route by Tallink. The prospective charter will improve the result of these vessels so that they will be generating a profit.\n\nIn winter 2016/2017, Tallink started operating MS Megastar, built in Meyer Turku Oy. The building contract was formally signed in February 2015. The ship is 212 meters long, has a passenger capacity of 2800 and is powered by liquefied natural gas.\n\nIn 2019 Tallink reached a franchise agreement with a global fast-food company, Burger King to open restaurants in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and according to the agreement, Tallink will have exclusive rights for running Burger King eateries in the Baltic states for 20 years. The company plans to open the first restaurant in each Baltic state in the first half of 2020. The enlargement of Burger King will employ around 800 people in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nIn April 2006 Tallink's ferry , en route from Tallinn to Stockholm, ignored when multiple passengers reported that a passenger had fallen overboard. The crew refused to stop the ship to search for the passenger and the 21-year-old Estonian male perished in the incident. Tallink later accepted no responsibility for the accident, emphasizing that none of the passengers confirmed actually seeing the man falling overboard or in the water.\n\n\n"}

It has scheduled passenger flights operated by a commuter air carrier, Fly Jet Center. \n\nFederal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 2,365 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 2,170 in 2009 and 2,016 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2015–2019 categorized it as a \"general aviation\" airport (the \"commercial service\" category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year).\n\nThe airport oprned as the W. W. Howes Municipal Airport, in 1937, named in honor of William Washington Howes, First Assistant Postmaster General under Franklin Roosevelt. Howes brought airmail service to the Midwest. The airport hangar pictured, below, was named the W. W. Howes hangar in 1998 due to the efforts of Howes' grandson, Dr. Whiting Wicker. The Current Termainal was opened in 1979\n\nWestern Airlines, which was a major air carrier based in Los Angeles, served Huron for a number of years. In 1948, Western was operating Douglas DC-3 flights from the airport on a multi-stop route between Denver and Minneapolis/St. Paul. By 1956, Huron was a stop on a daily round trip flight operated by the airline between Los Angeles and Minneapolis/St. Paul flown with a Convair 240 prop aircraft on a routing of Los Angeles - Las Vegas - Salt Lake City - Casper - Rapid City - Pierre - Huron - Minneapolis/St. Paul. In 1964, Western was operating Douglas DC-6B four engine propliners into the airport on a daily round trip multi-stop flight between Salt Lake City and Minneapolis/St. Paul with a routing of Salt Lake City - Casper - Rapid City - Pierre - Huron - Sioux Falls - Minneapolis/St. Paul. Western ceased serving Huron during the mid-1960s but continued to serve Pierre and Sioux Falls with Boeing 737-200 jet service into the 1980s before being acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines in 1987.\n\nBraniff International Airways, a major airline based in Dallas, served Huron during the 1950s. According to the April 27, 1958, Braniff system timetable, the airline was operating Douglas DC-3 service on a daily round trip routings of Kansas City - Lincoln - Omaha - Sioux City - Sioux Falls - Mitchell, SD - Huron - Watertown, SD - Minneapolis/St. Paul and also Minot - Bismarck - Aberdeen, SD - Huron - Watertown, SD - Minneapolis/St. Paul. The airline had ceased serving Huron by fall 1959. Braniff continued to serve both Sioux City and Sioux Falls and by 1966 had introduced jet service to both of these cities with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets.\n\nIn 1960, North Central Airlines was operating Douglas DC-3 service on direct, no change of plane flights from Huron to Minneapolis/St. Paul, Omaha, Sioux Falls and Minot via intermediate stops at other regional destinations. By 1965, North Central was serving Huron with Convair 440 propliners as well as with DC-3 aircraft and by 1967 the airline was operating Convair 580 turboprop airliners into the airport. In 1972, North Central was operating all of its flights from Huron with Convair 580 propjets with direct, no change of plane service to Chicago O'Hare Airport, Omaha, Sioux Falls, Minot and Rochester, MN. The same year, North Central was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service to Pierre and Sioux Falls but did not operate jet flights into Huron. In 1979, North Central merged with Southern Airways to form Republic Airlines (1979-1986) which in turn continued to serve Huron with Convair 580 flights. However, by 1982, Republic had discontinued all service into the airport. Republic was then acquired by and merged into Northwest Airlines in 1986.\n\nIn 1981, Northern Airlines, a commuter air carrier, was serving Huron with flights to Minneapolis/St. Paul, Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Pierre and other regional destinations.\n\nHuron Regional Airport covers 1,235 acres (500 ha) at an elevation of 1,289 feet (393 m) above mean sea level. It has two concrete runways: 12/30 is 7,201 by 100 feet (2,195 x 30 m) and 17/35 is 5,000 by 75 feet (1,524 x 23 m).\n\nIn 2010, the airport had 13,452 aircraft operations, averaging 36 per day. Of these, 89% were general aviation, 9% scheduled commercial and 2% military. 27 aircraft were then based at this airport, 82% single-engine, 11% multi-engine and 7% helicopters.\n\n"}

{"id": "2153700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153700", "title": "Prontosil", "text": "Prontosil\n\nProntosil is an antibacterial drug of the sulfonamide group. It has a relatively broad effect against gram-positive cocci but not against enterobacteria. One of the earliest antimicrobial drugs, it was widely used in the mid-20th century but is little used today because better options now exist. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine, because it greatly widened the success of antimicrobial chemotherapy in an era when many physicians doubted its still largely untapped potential. At the time, disinfectant cleaners and topical antiseptic wound care were widely used but there were very few antimicrobial drugs to use safely inside living bodies. Antibiotic drugs derived from microbes, which we rely on heavily today, did not yet exist. Prontosil was discovered in 1932 by a research team at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany.\n\nThe capitalized name \"Prontosil\" is Bayer's trade name; the nonproprietary names include sulfamidochrysoïdine, rubiazol, prontosil rubrum, prontosil flavum, aseptil rojo, streptocide, and sulfamidochrysoïdine hydrochloride. Because the drug predates the modern system of drug nomenclature, which ensures that nonproprietary names are well known from the inception of marketing, it was generally known among the public only by its trade name, and the trade name was the origin of some of the nonproprietary names (as also happened with \"aspirin\").\n\nThis compound was first synthesized by Bayer chemists Josef Klarer and Fritz Mietzsch as part of a research program designed to find dyes that might act as antibacterial drugs in the body. The molecule was tested and in the late autumn of 1932 was found effective against some important bacterial infections in mice by Gerhard Domagk, who subsequently received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Prontosil was the result of five years of testing involving thousands of compounds related to azo dyes.\n\nThe crucial test result (in a murine model of \"Streptococcus pyogenes\" systemic infection) that preliminarily established the antibacterial efficacy of Prontosil in mice dates from late December 1931. IG Farben filed a German patent application concerning its medical utility on December 25, 1932. The synthesis of the compound had been first reported by Paul Gelmo, a chemistry student working at the University of Vienna in his 1909 thesis, although he had not realized its medical potential.\n\nThe readily water-soluble sodium salt of sulfonamidochrysoidine, which gives a burgundy red solution and was trademarked Prontosil Solubile, was clinically investigated between 1932 and 1934, first at the nearby hospital at Wuppertal-Elberfeld headed by Philipp Klee, and then at the Düsseldorf University Hospital. The results were published in a series of articles in the February 15, 1935 issue of Germany's then pre-eminent medical scientific journal, \"Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift\", and were initially received with some skepticism by a medical community bent on vaccination and crude immunotherapy.\n\nLeonard Colebrook introduced it as a cure for puerperal fever. As impressive clinical successes with Prontosil started to be reported from all over Europe, and especially after a widely published treatment in 1936 of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. (a son of U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt), acceptance was quick and dozens of medicinal chemistry teams set out to improve Prontosil.\n\nIn late 1935, working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in the laboratory of Dr. Ernest Fourneau, Jacques and Thérèse Tréfouël, Dr. Daniel Bovet and Federico Nitti discovered that Prontosil is metabolized to sulfanilamide (para-aminobenzenesulfonamide), a much simpler, colorless molecule, reclassifying Prontosil as a prodrug. Prontalbin became the first oral version of sulfanilamide by Bayer, which had actually obtained a German patent on sulfanilamide as early as 1909, without realizing its medical potential at this time.\n\nIt has been argued that IG Farben might have made its breakthrough discovery with sulfanilamide in 1932 but, recognizing that it would not be patentable as an antibacterial, had spent the next three years developing Prontosil as a new, and therefore more easily patentable, compound. However Dr. Bovet, who has received a Nobel Prize for medicine, and one of the authors of the French discovery, wrote in 1988: \"Today, we have the proof that the chemists of Elberfeld were unaware of the properties of sulfanilamide at the time of our discovery and that it was by our communication that they were informed. To be convinced about it, it is enough to attentively examine the monthly reports of work of Mietzsch and Klarer during years 1935–1936 and especially the Log Book of Gerhard Domagk: the formula of sulphamide is consigned there – without comment – not before January 1936.\"\n\nDr. Alexander Ashley Weech (1895–1977), a pioneer pediatrician, while working at Columbia University's College of Physicians & Surgeons (in the affiliated New York Babies Hospital) treated the first patient in the United States with an antibiotic (sulfanilamide; prontosil) in 1935 which led to a new era of medicine across the Atlantic. Dr. Weech researched Domagk's work, translating the German article, and \"was so intrigued by [the] experiments and by the three accompanying clinical articles on Prontosil that he contacted a pharmaceutical house, obtained a supply of the drug, and proceeded to treat a patient [a daughter of a colleague] who had serious streptococcal disease.\" Dr. Perrin Long and Dr. Eleanor Bliss of Johns Hopkins University began their pioneering work later on prontosil and sulfanilamide which led to the large scale production of this new treatment saving the lives of millions with systemic bacterial infections.\n\nSulfanilamide was cheap to produce and (due to the early date of its original composition of matter patent which made no reference to a medical use) was already off-patent when its antibacterial properties were first made public. Since the sulfanilamide moiety was also easy to link into other molecules, chemists soon gave rise to hundreds of second-generation sulfonamide drugs. As a result, Prontosil failed to make the profits in the marketplace hoped for by Bayer. Although quickly eclipsed by these newer \"sulfa drugs\" and, in the mid-1940s and through the 1950s by penicillin and other antibacterials that proved more effective against more types of bacteria, Prontosil remained on the market until the 1960s. Prontosil's discovery ushered in the era of antibacterial drugs and had a profound effect on pharmaceutical research, drug laws, and medical history.\n\nSulfonamide-trimethoprim combinations (co-trimoxazole) are still used extensively against opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, urinary infections and in the treatment of burns. However, in many other situations, sulfa drugs have been replaced by beta-lactam antibacterials.\n"}

The signal can be heard in parts of Washington, Idaho, Montana and British Columbia, and it operates translator stations in three communities. KXLY-FM is one of seven local Spokane FM radio stations heard across Canada to subscribers of the Shaw Direct satellite TV service.\n\nKXLY-FM first signed on the air in September 1959. It was the FM counterpart to KXLY (AM 920), owned by the Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation, which also owned KXLY-TV. KXLY-FM was Spokane's second FM station after KREM-FM (now co-owned KZZU-FM). Initially, KXLY-FM had an effective radiated power (ERP) of only 2,000 watts, a fraction of its current output. It mostly simulcast the AM station at first.\n\nIn the early 1960s, KXLY-FM was separately programmed with a largely automated beautiful music format. It played fifteen minute sweeps of instrumental music, mostly cover versions of popular songs, along with Broadway and Hollywood showtunes. KXLY-FM continued as an easy listening station for nearly three decades. In 1962, KXLY-AM-FM-TV were acquired by the Spokane Television Company.

Its capital is Falmouth. It is bordered by the parishes of Saint Ann in the east, Saint James in the west, and Saint Elizabeth and Manchester in the south. Trelawny is known for producing several Olympic sprinters.\n\nIn 1770, the wealthy planters in St James and St Ann succeeded in having sections of those parishes become the parish of Trelawny as they were too far from administrative centres. Trelawny was named after Sir William Trelawny, 6th Baronet, the then Governor of Jamaica, whose prominent family had originated at the manor of Trelawny in the parish of Pelynt in Cornwall, England. The first capital was Martha Brae, located inland from Rock Bay.\n\nTrelawny is best known for its sugar estates and sugar cane mills. It had more sugar estates than any other parish, so there was need for a sea coast town to export it. Falmouth became a thriving seaport and social centre. The town had two of its own newspapers; \"The Falmouth Post\" and \"The Falmouth Gazette\".\n\nTrelawny was also home to the largest group of Jamaican Maroons. A 1739 treaty between the Maroons and the English gave the Maroons freedom and land, which effectively put a stop to their raids on the plantations. However, a second Maroon uprising in 1795 led to about 600 Maroons being exiled to Nova Scotia, Canada, and later to Sierra Leone in Africa, in 1800.\n\nIn 2007, the opening ceremony for the ICC Cricket World Cup was held in Trelawny Parish.\n\nTrelawny is located at latitude 18°15'N, longitude 77°46'W. It has an area of 874 km², making it the fifth largest parish on the island. It has a population of 75,558 as of 2012. Most of the parish is flat, with wide plains such as Queen of Spain's Valley, above sea level, and Windsor, above sea level. Most of southern Trelawny is around above sea level. The highest point in the parish is Mount Ayr which is above sea level.\n\nThe southern section of Trelawny is part of the Cockpit Country, and is uninhabitable. It is therefore a natural reserve for flora and fauna; most of Jamaica's 27 endemic bird species can be found there, along with yellow snakes, and the giant swallowtail butterfly, the largest butterfly in the western hemisphere.\n\nMost of the parish has the typical limestone features of sinkholes, caves, and underground passages. There are about 48 caves, most with phosphate gatherings. These include the Windsor Cave and Carambi Cave (known for its beauty and phosphate deposits). There are several other caves which have Taino carvings on the walls. There are also several underground conduits, with the longest running for . The main rivers are the Martha Brae, Rio Bueno, Cane and Quashie Rivers.\n\nTrelawny's sources of employment are based on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Rum and sugar are Trelawny's principal products. Other crops include bananas, yams, strawberries, vegetables, pimento, coffee, ginger, papaya and coconut. Though the fishing industry is declining, Trelawny still produces a large amount of fish. There are ten beaches along the coast, with more than 30 boats each, as well as 27 fish ponds.\n\nThere are 25 factories in the parish. These produce sugar, rum, and apparel, among other things. Two of the eight remaining sugar factories in Jamaica are in Trelawny —Hampden Sugar Factory, and Trelawny Sugar, formerly Long Pond Sugar Factory.\n\nTrelawny Parish is the birthplace of several track and field athletes: Usain Bolt, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Marvin Anderson, Ricardo Chambers, Omar Brown, Michael Frater, Lerone Clarke, Dane Hyatt, Rosemarie Whyte, Michael Greene, Inez Turner, Debbie-Ann Parris, Sanya Richards, Ben Johnson and Warren Weir. \n\nThe supercentenarian Violet Brown (1900-2017), who was at a time the oldest verified living person in the world, was born and resided in Trelawny.\n\nIt is also the birthplace of 2008 USA Today High School Basketball Player of the Year Samardo Samuels, previously of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Other notable citizens include DJ Kamau Preston, dancehall artist Charly Black, basketballer Milo Channing, Rex Nettleford, University of Connecticut basketball player Kentan Facey, and star safety for the Green Bay Packers and Maurice Haughton, Atari Bigby.\n\n"}

Its capital is Montego Bay (derived from the Spanish word \"manteca\" (lard) because many wild hogs were found there, from which lard was made). Montego Bay was officially named the second city of Jamaica, behind Kingston, in 1981, although Montego Bay became a city in 1980 through an act of the Jamaican Parliament. The parish is the birthplace of the Right Excellent Samuel Sharpe (died 1833), one of Jamaica's seven National Heroes.\n\nWhen the Spanish occupied Jamaica, Montego Bay was an export point for lard, which was obtained from wild hogs in the forests. In many of the early maps of Jamaica, Montego Bay was listed as \"Bahia de Manteca\" (Lard Bay). The parish was given the name \"St. James\" in honour of King James II by Sir Thomas Modyford, the island's first English Governor. At the beginning of the English rule, the parish was one of the poorest; it had no towns, few inhabitants and little commerce, except for the exported lard. However, after the treaty with the Maroons in 1739, St. James became one of the most important sugar-producing parishes. Annually, more than 150 ships arrived in Montego Bay bringing slaves and supplies, and taking sugar. Commerce developed as wealthy merchants and planters erected many elaborate town houses. In 1773, Montego Bay had the only newspaper outside of Kingston - \"The Cornwall Chronicle\".\n\nFire, in 1795 and again in 1811, destroyed much of Montego Bay. After being rebuilt, it was again destroyed in 1831 by a rebellion led by Sam Sharpe. This rebellion was as a result of slave owners' reluctance to free the slaves, even after England proposed an end to slavery. Sam Sharpe had advocated passive resistance but this was met by violence. As a result, a group of slaves responded in turn with and began setting fire to buildings and the surrounding plantations and cane fields. As a result of being the main planner of the rebellion, Sam Sharpe was hanged in the Montego Bay market place, which is today known as Sam Sharpe Square.\n\nAfter emancipation in 1834, the fortunes of the town and parish declined until the banana trade was promoted by J. E. Kerr and Co. This prompted the start of tourism in Jamaica. A Freeport was constructed in the 1960s, and later, a cruise ship terminal was opened. Montego Bay was accorded city status on 1 May 1980. The Sangster International Airport, the busiest airport in Jamaica and the Anglophone Caribbean and one of two international airports on the island, is located in Montego Bay.\n\nThe parish is bordered by Trelawny in the east, St. Elizabeth in the south and Hanover and Westmoreland in the west. It covers an area of 594.9 km², making it one of the smallest parishes in Jamaica. The population was 184,662 in 2012.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the parish consists of limestone. The Nassau Mountains, which rise from St. Elizabeth, south of the parish, extend diagonally across St. James. The range then declines to a point just south of Montego Bay. Its highest point is approximately 1524 metres above sea level.\n\nGreat River, which serves as the boundary between St. James and its neighboring parishes Hanover and Westmoreland, and the Montego River, which rises in central St. James and flows north, then west to Montego Bay, are the two main rivers.\n\nThe city of Montego Bay may be roughly divided into two sections: the tourist area, which occupies the northern section of the bay along the shore line, and the commercial and industrial sections, which are second only to Kingston in size and volume of trade.\n\nToday, Saint James is one of the fastest growing parishes on the island with large credits going to Montego Bay, because it is seen as an alternative to the overpopulated Kingston and Saint Andrew Corporate Area.\n\nAgricultural activities include forestry, and the production of sugar cane and other domestic crops. There are approximately 60 manufacturing establishments in the south of the parish, mainly for garment, woodwork, and food processing. There are also many industrial zones, including The Montego Free Zone, Bogue Industrial Estate and Ironshore.\n\nTourism is the main source of employment in the parish; one in four persons are employed in tourism. The major forms of employment in tourism are:\n\nThere are many famous hotels located in the parish of St. James, most of them in the Rose Hall area, including Doctors Cave Beach Hotel,Riu Hotels, Wyndham Rose Hall, Sandals and Beaches Resorts, the Ritz Carlton Hotel, Hyatt Ziva, Riu, Holiday Inn, Half Moon Hotel and the Iberostar Hotel located in Lilliput.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also the paternal uncle of actress Lois Chiles.\n\nEddie Chiles was born in Itasca, Texas to Harsh Edmonds Chiles and Jewell Files. After graduating from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri, he worked as an oil patch roustabout and as a merchant marine before hitchhiking to Norman, Oklahoma in 1930. In 1934, he graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a B.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering.\nIn 1939, after working as a Sales Engineer with Reed Roller Bit Company in Houston, he founded the Western Company of North America. He started the company with two trucks and three employees. Western served the petroleum industry with technical services required in the discovery and production of oil and gas. The company grew to become a major oil services firm, primarily in acidizing, fracturing and cementing. At its peak, the Western Company had over 5,000 employees and annual worldwide revenues of over $500 million. During the 1970s, the Western Company also operated an offshore drilling company run by Mr. Chiles' brother, Clay Chiles. The company was sold to BJ Services in 1995.\n\nChiles bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1980 and served as chairman of the club until 1989 when he sold the team to a group of investors that included the future President of the United States George W. Bush; New York stockbroker Richard Gilder (who later married Chiles' niece, Lois); Frank L. Morsani; and the Mack family.\n\nAs an advocate for a smaller and less intrusive federal government, Chiles was also known for his 1970s radio commentaries. His trade-mark sign-on \"I'm Eddie Chiles, and I'm mad as hell,\" created an incredible demand for bumper stickers that read \"I'm mad too, Eddie!\" Western also featured television commercials telling viewers \"\"If you don't have an oil well, get one you'll love doing business with Western!\"\" Through these conservative radio commentaries, Chiles became a folk hero in the southwest section of the nation. He died in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nChiles was married to Fran Hafer, and had two children from a previous marriage, Jerry Edmond Chiles and Carol Ann Chiles Ballard.\n"}

{"id": "2153763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153763", "title": "University of Valladolid", "text": "University of Valladolid\n\nThe University of Valladolid is a public university in the city of Valladolid, province of Valladolid, in the autonomous region of Castile and Leon, Spain. Established in the 13th century, it is one of the oldest universities in the world. The university has 32,000 undergraduate students and more than 2,000 teachers.\n\nThe University of Valladolid (UVa) is a Spanish public university founded in 1241 as removal of studies at the University of Palencia, founded by Alfonso VIII of Castile, between 1208 and 1212. It is responsible for teaching higher education in seven campuses distributed through four cities of Castile and Leon: Valladolid, Palencia, Soria and Segovia.\n\nThe first building of the university that is notable for its architecture is the one constructed at the end of the 15th century, after the move of the institution from the Colegiata. It consists of a four sided cloister, which opens up the hallways, and a late Gothic chapel. At the cloister one enters through a portal, also late Gothic, that opens to the Bookshop Street. At the beginning of the 18th century, this became insufficient, prompting an enlargement consisting of a quadrangular cloister with four galleries that open to hallways built at the same time.\n\nFrom the Plaza de Santa María (today the University Square), one can see the Baroque facade designed by the Carmelite Fray Pedro de la Visitación and constructed in 1715. There are sculptural groups that represent allegories of the subjects that are taught in the building. The central section, organized into four columns of giants, is finished off by a giant ornamental comb.\n\nIn 1909, and with great controversy, it was decided to destroy the old building, including the entrance hall from the 15th century that opened to Bookshop Street, in order to construct a new building following a design by the architect Teodosio Torres. The Baroque facade was kept.\n\nTorres's design featured two cloisters. A staircase was situated between both cloisters and a great vestibule opened to Bookshop Street. The facade of the university building to this street was based on a reinterpretation of the Baroque facade of Fray Pedro, with a mixture of Plateresque, Baroque and Neoclassical decorative elements. At one side of the facade was an observation tower and on the other was a new clock tower that filled the corner between the University Sq. and Bookshop St.\n\nThe project experienced problems as the Baroque facade was incorporated slowly. In 1939, the building suffered a fire. To alleviate the problem of the facade's integration into Torres's building, Constantino Candeira designed a great staircase and vestibule, in the historicist style, that was accessed through the Baroque facade. The staircase is an example of the triumphalist and historicist architecture of Postwar Spain.\n\nIn 1968 the building was finished with the destruction of the second cloister and the construction of a five-floor building to house students, and the destruction of Torres's building which had been built for far fewer students. In this same reform, the observation tower and the great auditorium of 1909. The facade that faces Librería was remodeled, losing the vestigial historicism of Torres. The new auditorium flanks the facade of Fray Pedro on one of its sides.\n\nThe computer science department has hosted programming contests for the Association for Computing Machinery using online judging of the submitted programs.\nWithin the university there are cultural associations for music and theatre.\n\nThe youth symphonic orchestra: the \"Joven Orquesta de la Universidad de Valladolid\" (Youth Orchestra of the University of Valladolid, JOUVa) is run by students of the university, and headquartered in the \"Residencia Universitaria Alfonso VIII\" of Valladolid. Since its founding in 1998 Francisco Lara Tejero has been the artistic musical director.\n\nThe choir, the \"Coro de la Universidad de Valladolid\" (Choir of the University of Valladolid), is directed by Marcos Castán and the Early Music Group \"El Parnasso\".\n\nThe theatre group is \"Gente de Teatro de la Uva\", founded in 1984 with the name of \"People's Theatre of the Faculty of Medicine\", that from 1998 became the official theater group of the university. Its director is Carlos Burguillo.\n\nThrough the \"Area of Extension and Culture\", the university presents cultural programs throughout the year, with special emphasis on the \"UniversiJazz\" Festival\" and \"Santa Cruz\".\n\nValladolid University supports cultural initiatives such as those developed by the \"Hermandad Universitaria del Santo Cristo de la Luz\", which includes Christmas and Auto Passion. It assists in the concerts that are organized through each Vice President for University Association and with public and private partnerships.\n\nThe university library has 14 library services : they are located in Palencia, Soria and Segovia provinces, the rest are situated in Valladolid, each of them have a director. All the services are managed by a Chief Librarian and coordinated by Central Services.\nThe book collection is available through the Almena Catalogue and UVaDoc repository.\n\nThe collection has 970,000 books, some of which are important ; for example its ancient book collection has 45,000 titles including manuscripts and incunabulum of 10th century. Periodicals: 16,000 titles, E-journals: 21,000 titles, E-books: 900, Data bases: 66. , Theses and Masters projects: 33,000. \nLibrary Services : Website, reading room, interlibrary and intercampus loan, loan (book collection), computers, e-books, bibliographic information, user education online through Moodle, subject guides, and tutorials.\n\nThe library is a member of OCLC, Europe Direct, REBIUN, Dialnet, Catálogo 17, ABBA, Documat, REDINED y BUCLE.\n\n\n"}

They are a manifestation of gene amplification as a result of chromothripsis, during the development of tumors, which give the cells selective advantages for growth and survival. This selective advantage is as a result of double minutes frequently harboring amplified oncogenes and genes involved in drug resistance. Double minutes, like actual chromosomes, are composed of chromatin and replicate in the nucleus of the cell during cell division. Unlike typical chromosomes, they are composed of circular fragments of DNA, up to only a few million base pairs in size and contain no centromere or telomere. Further to this, they often lack key regulatory elements, allowing genes to be constitutively expressed. Recently, some research groups are re-branding double minutes as ecDNA.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2153777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153777", "title": "Military academies in Russia", "text": "Military academies in Russia\n\nRussia has a number of military academies of different specialties. This article primarily lists institutions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation rather than those of the Soviet Armed Forces.\n\nRussian institutions called \"academy\" are post-graduate professional military schools for experienced, commissioned officers who have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree. Upon graduation, officers receive the equivalent of a master's degree and, if trained in military leadership are appointed as battalion commanders or higher from Lt. Colonel and up. Graduates with non-command training are appointed to various staff positions equivalent to Major or Lt. Colonel. Commissioned officers can study on the Kandidat Nauk () level, equivalent to a Ph.D. degree. This research-oriented degree is required for faculty positions in military schools and defence research institutes. Carefully selected experienced researchers in military academies hold limited-term positions as senior scholars leading to the prestigious post-doctoral Doktor Nauk () degree, which is roughly the equivalent of a habilitation at Central European universities where it is a prerequisite for full professor positions in institutions of higher learning. There also are a number of \"officer commissioning schools\" for various services known as Higher Military Schools or Institutes.\n\nAs of 2010, a major reorganization of Russian military officer education, spanning the range from General Staff Academy to officer commissioning school, was underway.\n\nPrevious names include: Marshal Voroshilov Military Academy of the WPRA General Staff; General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR; General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\n\nIn 1936 Leonid Govorov founded the current General Staff Academy in Moscow. It has been the senior Russian professional school for officers in their late 1930s. The \"best and the brightest\" senior commissioned officers of all forces are selected to attend this most prestigious of all Soviet military academies. Students are admitted to the Academy in the ranks of lieutenant colonel, colonel, and Major General (one star). Most are colonels or newly promoted generals.\n\nThe precedence and grouping of these academies are drawn from Michael Holm's site.\n\nIn 1918 the Frunze Military Academy () in Moscow was established as the academy of the General Staff, which became the RKKA Military Academy in 1921. It is named after Mikhail Frunze then USSR Minister of Defence in mid-1920s. It is roughly the equivalent of the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas or the British Army's Staff College, Camberley. Officers in their late twenties up to thirty-two years at the rank of Captain or Major enter if they pass the competitive entry examinations.\n\nIn the 1930s, higher academic courses were added to the Frunze curriculum as an advanced training program for previous graduates. Later on, this program became the basis for the \"Voroshilov General Staff Academy\" and the Frunze Academy refocused upon combined arms ground warfare training at the tactical level. In September 1998 the Frunze Academy and the \"Malinovsky Academy\" were amalgamated into the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the site of the former Frunze Academy, which since 2010 is known as \"Military Educational and Scientific Centre\". The \"Military Educational and Scientific Centre\" has been the site of a number of Russian-Western joint military activities, including an IISS conference in February 2001, and U.S.-Russian exercises.\n\nAfter graduation from \"Military Educational and Scientific Center\", every graduate officer receives a diploma and a silver diamond-shaped badge which has to be worn on the right side of his uniform or civilian clothes above all other military or civilian decorations or ribbon bars.\n\nMalinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy () was established in 1932 in Moscow as the \"J.V. Stalin Academy of the WPRA Mechanization and Motorization Program\". It was named after Marshal Rodion Malinovsky in 1967. Its mission was to train Soviet and Warsaw Pact commanders, staff officers, and engineers for armored and mechanized units. The best-qualified graduates were selected for the\" centralized operations division\" of the General Staff. Students entered as captains and majors, some as lieutenant colonels, about on an intermediate level with the Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. Commanding and staff officers underwent a three-year program while engineers were taught for 4 years. In 1998 the Academy merged with the Frunze Academy to become the \"Combined Arms Academy\".\n\nMikhailovskaya Military Artillery Academy () in Saint Petersburg dates back to 1698. In 1849 it was named \"Mikhailovskaya\" after Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia. In 1925 it merged into the Red Army Military Technical Academy, was restored in 1953 as Kalinin Artillery Military Academy () as a spin-off of the Dzerzhinsky Academy, and in 1995 went back to the Grand Duke's name.\n\nThe Vasilevsky Military Academy of Army Air Defence Forces () was created in 1977 in Kiev as a spin-off of the Kalinin Artillery Military Academy. It was named after Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, its Kiev campus evolved into the General Staff Academy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which became the Ivan Chernyakhovsky National Defence University of Ukraine from 2013. In 1992, most of the staff and cadets moved to Smolensk and the facilities of the Smolensk Higher Engineering Radioelectronic School of the Ground Forces Air Defence Branch (established 1970), which became its new home. It re-adopted the honorific \"named for Marshal of the Soviet Union A.M. Vasilevskiy\" on 11 May 2007.\n\nLocated in Moscow, this military academy trained medium-rank commissioned officers for the Engineering Troops. Its full formal title until 1998 was the Military-Engineering order of Lenin Red Banner Academy named for V.V. Kuybyshev. After the 1998 merger with the Military Engineering University of St. Petersburg it is now called the \"Combined Arms Military Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation-Military Engineering Forces Institute\" ().\n\nBudyonny Military Academy of Communications () was created in 1932 in Leningrad. It is named after Semyon Budyonny. It trains the Russian military's future signals and communications experts.\n\nTimoshenko NBC Protection Military Academy () was established in 1932 in Moscow. It is named after Semyon Timoshenko. Its duties are for the training of officers and NCOs in chemical warfare and defence. It is located in Kostroma in Kostroma Oblast and has now opened its doors to engineering cadets as well.\n\nThe Military Logistics Academy () was created in 1918 in Leningrad. It trains officers and NCO's for the various Armed Forces rear services and the Army Transportation Force, a part of the rear services. One of its graduates is Igor Levitin, a former Russian Minister of Transport.\n\nThe Kirov Military Medical Academy ( in Saint Petersburg was established in 1798. Senior medical staff are trained for the Armed Forces and conduct research in military medical services. By contemporary standards, it is a full-scale medical school complete with a network of teaching and research clinics and affiliated hospitals. Graduates are commissioned as officers with medical doctor credentials. The institution also provides advanced training for mid-career military medical doctors and trains graduate students to Ph.D. level.\n\nIn 1939 a military medical academy was established in Kuybyshev, since 1991 renamed Samara Military-Medical Institute. Subordinate to Ministry of Defence for a period.\n\nEstablished on 21 December 1917 as \"Moscow 1st Machine-Gunners School\", this school trains the future officers of the Russian Army in strategy, tactics and command skills, with a four-year study period for which graduates are commissioned Russian Army lieutenants.\n\nThe school's cadets are also known as the \"Kremlin Cadets\" or the \"Kremlovtsy\", for in December 1919 after just two years of operations, the Red Army took over the school administration, with headquarters and campus then at the Moscow Kremlin. It later became the \"WPRA 1st Soviet High Military School \"All-Russian Central Executive Committee\"\" and from 1925 to 1935, mounted the guard at Lenin's Mausoleum. The Kremlin was its campus until it moved to Moscow's Lefortovo District, giving way to the Kremlin Regiment, nowadays the President of Russia's escort and historical regiment.\n\nIn 1937, the school became the \"ACEC\" Moscow Military School and later the \"Moscow Military School of Infantry Training\". It received the first of its 3 order medals, the Order of the Red Banner in 1938. In joining the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, and the Second World War's Eastern Front it contributed to the defence of the Moscow Region, as well as other wars. In October 1945, 5 months after the allied victory in Europe, it moved to Kuzminki District in Moscow.\n\nIn 1958, it became the Moscow High Command Training School \"Supreme Soviet of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\" . It received its two other awards, the Order of Lenin in 1965 and the Order of the October Revolution in 1978. In 1998, it became the Moscow Military School and was transformed into its present name in 2017.\n\nThis training center in Khabarovsk 19 miles from the Chinese border serves military officers stationed in the Eastern Military District, with a program to enhance their experience and command capability.\n\nLocated in historic St. Petersburg, the birthplace of the Russian railway industry, this institute trains all personnel of the world's oldest railway security force, the Russian Railway Troops, a part since 2004 of the rear services, in maintaining and securing one of the world's largest and oldest railway systems.\n\nThe Ryazan Guards Higher Airborne Command School is one of Russia's oldest military academies, having been established in 1918. The academy serves since 1941 as the premier academy and advanced training center of the Russian Airborne Troops, named first in honor of the Komsomol and at present after one of the greatest commanders of the Airborne Troops, Vasily Margelov, who was instrumental in the modernization and capability upgrades done to the service in the 1950s, as well as for its full independence as a separate arm directly responsible to the Defence Ministry.\n\nThe Far Eastern Higher Combined Arms Command School was established in 1940 as the Vladivostok Infantry School. It moved to Blagoveshchensk in 1949, and currently trains officers for motor rifle units, and for the Naval Infantry. It is the only military academy in Russia to offer command specialisations in mountain and arctic warfare.\n\nIn Soviet times this was named the \"Leningrad Nikolaevsky Military Engineering Technical Institute of the Armed Forces of the USSR\".\n\nNikolaevsky Military Engineering-Technical Institute of the Armed Forces, now the Military Engineering-Technical University () is in Saint Petersburg located in its own historical sites near to Engineers Castle, Summer Garden, the Suvorov Museum, Tauride Palace and Smolny Convent. It is one of Saint Petersburg's oldest military engineering schools, its history as a Higher learning institution began in 1810, training officers for service in the Navy, Russian engineering troops and other arms and services. This Engineering school trained and graduated Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nLocated in Yekaterinburg, it serves as the officer command training center of the Russian Ground Forces Artillery and Rocket Forces. Its mandate is for the enhanced and improved training of artillery officers in command and control.\n\nLocated in Volsk, the school trains the various personnel of the Russian Armed Forces' rear services.\n\nEstablished in 1909 and known in the 1930s as the Leningrad Military Academy of Physical Fitness \"General Staff of the Armed Forces\", the academy serves as the training hub for military sportsmen of the Russian Armed Forces. Its graduates include many medalists in the Olympic Games who were also active servicemen, and medalists in the Military World Games.\n\nIt was affilated to both the Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport and Health and the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth and Tourism, and serves as the training hub for military sportsmen of the Russian Armed Forces. Its graduates include many medalists in the Olympic Games who were also active servicemen, and medalists in the Military World Games. Based in Saint Petersburg, its colours carries two awards of the Order of the Red Banner for its invaluable contribution in sports development.\n\nThe Moscow Military Music College is a spin-off of the Suvorov Military School (affiliated with the school in 1944 but was established in 1937). Its mission was and still is to train future Soviet Army and Russian Army and Air Force military musicians and conductors and is famous for its Corps of Drums, a participant in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 and a regular participant in Revolution Day (1940 to 1990), Victory Day (1965, 1985, 1990, 1995–2008, 2012–present), and until 1966 May Day military parades. The corps is led by a drum major. The corps's instrumentation includes snare drums, fifes, trumpets, glockenspiels and during occasions, bass drums, tenor drums and fanfare bugles. A Turkish crescent from the college was used as its symbol in the Revolution Day and Victory Day parades from 1975 to 1990, later replaced in 1995 by the college's color guard squad carrying the collegiate Regimental Color (a new color was granted to the institution in 2008). It also has its own nationally and internationally famous training band wing that perform in various military tattoos in Russia and various European countries.\n\nJust in time for its 80th anniversary the \"Valery Khalilov\" honorific title was bestowed on December 26, 2016, by the Minister of Defence General of the Army Sergei Shoygu - a day after the tragic crash that killed Khalilov and 91 others off Sochi while the Alexandrov Ensemble was on its way to perform for Russian troops deployed in Syria. The decision was made public by the spokesperson of the MoD Major General Igor Kinashenkov.\n\nThese included the Leningrad, Orenburg (), and Poltava Higher Anti-Aircraft Missile Command Schools of the Ground Forces, and the Smolensk Higher Anti-Aircraft Missile Engineering School.\nAlso the Kharkov Guards Higher Tank Command School, plus Tashkent, Ulyanovsk VTKUs.\n\nThe Academy descended from Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy () of Imperial Russia created in 1820 in St. Petersburg. Dzerzhinsky Military Academy () was created in 1932 as F.E. Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy (Артиллерийская академия имени Ф. Э. Дзержинского) of the \"Red Army from the \"Artillery Department and the Powder and Explosives\" section of the Military Technical Academy's chemistry department that was disbanded at the time.\n\nDzerzhinsky Academy was moved from Leningrad to Moscow in 1958, the year before the Strategic Rocket Forces were formed. Now named the Dzerzhinsky Missile Force Academy, its main facility was 'located at Kitayskiy Proyezd 9/5, within a block' of the Rossiya Hotel off Red Square. Other sources report that it was in the historical building of the Moscow Orphanage. Officers in command positions in the Strategic Missile Troops would seek admission to this academy. Information about this academy was highly classified. Its two major faculties were \"command\" and \"engineering.\" The Academy was renamed after Peter the Great in 1997 (), and its Commandant is now Colonel General (three star) Yuriy F. Kirillov.\n\nThe Gagarin Military Air Academy is located at Monino, northeast of Moscow, in an area closed to foreigners, nearby the Central Air Force Museum. Almost all the senior officers in the Soviet Air Force have attended this academy. It is charged with the preparation of \"command cadres of various aviation specialties and is a research center for working out problems of operational art of the Air Force and tactics of branches and types of aviation.\" Part of the mandate involves developing new techniques in the operational use of the military aircraft.\n\nThe “Marshal of the Soviet Union L.A. Govorov Air Defence Radio Engineering Academy” () was first established in Moscow in 1941 as a subsidiary of the “Frunze Military Academy” and then moved to Kharkiv (Russian: “Kharkov”) in 1946. This graduate school trained commissioned officers of the Air Defence Force in radars, aerospace defence and surface-to-air missile sites, and command and control and communications facilities. Its graduates were granted an equivalent of the Master of Electrical or Systems Engineering degree. Also about 50 officers were annually graduating with a \"Kandidat Nauk\" degree (an equivalent of a Ph.D.). Of the total of some 300 faculty members, more than 10 per cent held the prestigious post-doctoral \"Doktor Nauk\" degree. Faculty members were highly engaged in applied research; their textbooks and research publications were known throughout the Soviet Union.\n\nThis school was re-organized into the “Kharkiv Military University” of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1992, soon after the collapse of the USSR. According to the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers’ directive #433 (10.09.2003) the Military University and the Air Force Institute combined to become the Kharkiv National University of the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nSee Zhukov Air and Space Defence Academy.\n\nAlso in St. Petersburg, this is the academy responsible for the training of the future officers and NCOs of the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces, the armed forces' youngest branch of service. It was most recently renamed the Military Space Engineering Academy in November 2002.\n\nLocated in Yaroslavl, this academy trains officers and NCOs of the air defence component of the Russian Air Force in proper treatment and handling of air defence rocket artillery systems.\n\nShelton lists a total of 140 officer commissioning schools, drawn from a KZ list of 17 January 1980. That total included 15 Air Defence Forces schools (four Fighter Aviation, five radio-electronics, and six Anti-Aircraft Rocket), and 24 Air Forces (nine Higher Aviation Schools of Pilots, including the Borisoglebsk Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots at Borisoglebsk, two navigator schools (including the Chelyabinsk Higher Military Aviation School of Navigators/5Oth Anniversary of the Komsomols), the Khar'kov Higher Military Aviation Command School of Signals, five three-year technical secondary schools, six Air Force engineering schools (including the Kiev Higher Military Aviation Engineering School), and the Kurgan Higher Military-Political Aviation School.\n\nThese centers do a great deal of scientific and technical work in mastering new aircraft, equipment, and air combat tactics for the Russian Air Forces.\n\n\nAs part of the ongoing military reform, the Defence Ministry has undertaken to create large consolidated educational entities within the Armed Forces. In the naval sphere the leading institution is the Military Educational and Scientific Center (Russ. ВУНЦ)- Fleet Admiral Of the Soviet Union N.G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy. This organization is responsible for the direct oversight of all naval training and educational institutions spanning students from grade school age through post-command senior officers destined to hold the highest positions in the Russian military.\n\nLocated in Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island this school is for upper grade school aged youths interested in eventually attending the Nakhimov Naval School, a preparatory school for the several officers' commissioning institutions of the Russian Navy.\n\nFounded in 1944 and located in St. Petersburg in an impressive baroque building adjacent to the AURORA, the Navy's oldest commissioned warship and the ship that has been credited with signaling the beginning of the October Revolution, this institution can be considered a naval preparatory school. Successful graduates from its program can directly enter the officer commissioning schools without sitting for the competitive entrance examinations. Originally, the Nakhimov Schools and their army equivalents, the Suvorov Schools, were established to provide education for the sons of officers who perished during the war. There were three Nakhimov Schools (Leningrad-1944, Tbilisi-1944, and Riga-1945) but the Tbilisi and Riga schools were closed in 1955 and 1952, respectively. Only the school in St. Petersburg continues to function until 2016, when the School was expanded to include campuses in major Russian naval base towns.\n\nThis is Russia's oldest naval officer commissioning school and institution of higher learning. Originally established as the School of Mathematics and Navigational Sciences in Moscow by Peter the Great the school was later moved to St. Petersburg. It is located on the embankment of the Neva River opposite the Admiralty Shipyard. In Soviet times it was known as the M.V. Frunze Higher Naval School. The great majority of Imperial Russia's and the Soviet Union's most outstanding naval officers and admiralty leadership are graduates of this school. Recently, the Leninskiy Komsomol Submarine Navigation Higher Naval School in St. Petersburg was absorbed by this institution.\n\nLocated in Kaliningrad, this naval officer commissioning school educates general profile officers as well as specialists in communications and intelligence.\n\nLocated in Vladivostok, this naval officer commissioning school educates general profile officers for service in the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet.\n\nLocated in Sevastopol, this naval officer commissioning school educates general profile officers for service in the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThis is the Russian Navy's officer commissioning school for specialists in naval electronics and computer technologies. It is located near the imperial summer palace in Peterhof, St. Petersburg.\n\nThis naval school commissions engineering officers, specializing in both conventional and nuclear propulsion and associated systems. This institute is located in Pushkin, St. Petersburg and now combines the F. Dzerzhinskiy Higher Naval Engineering School formerly located in the Admiralty building and the Higher Naval Engineering School which had been located in Pushkin near the lake of the imperial Catherine Palace.\n\nLocated in St. Petersburg and a distinct branch of the Higher Educational-Scientific Center \"N.G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy\" in its own location, this institution provides advanced education for prospective Executive and Commanding Officers as well as for officers going on to be \"flag specialists\" on the commands and staff officers of large naval formations and fleets.\n\nThe Kuznetsov Naval Academy located in St. Petersburg is the Soviet Navy's only senior service school. The students are lieutenants commander, commanders, and some captains, with ages from 30–35 years. All naval officers (including naval aviation) holding positions of Executive Officers, Commanding Officers, formation, fleet, or naval staff command positions are graduates of this academy. First established in 1827 as the Advance Officers' Class of the Imperial Russian Navy and later the Nikolayev Naval Academy and reorganized as the Petrograd Maritime Academy in 1917, and at various times renamed as the WPRF Naval Academy, the Marshal of the Soviet Union Kliment Voroshilov Naval Academy and the Marshal of the Soviet Union Andrey Grechko Naval Academy, it gained its current name and title in 1990. Among its alumni are decorated naval officers of the Imperial Russian, Soviet, and now Russian navies, and recipients of various state orders and decorations.\n\nIn order to qualify to command any naval or MOD operational-strategic or strategic formation (command) senior naval officers must complete the course of study at the Military Academy of the General Staff in order also to be promoted to senior and flag officer ranks.\n\nThis academy trains future officers of the Ministry of the Interior's various military forces. It was founded in 1932 as a training venue for the NKVD's future command officers, entitled as a post graduate school for the advanced officers in the interior services.\n\nLocated in St. Petersburg, the NGFCMI serves as the training facility for personnel of the National Guard Forces Command of the National Guard of Russia, both officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers. It was established on September 4, 1947 as the MVD Central School and since then as gone on many transformations before acquiring its present title in 2016.\n\nAs one of the premier post-graduate schools of Russia's Internal Affairs Ministry its purpose is for the enhancement and continued training for officers and NCOs of the Ministry's various arms and services, including the Police, Drug Control Administration and the Tax Police. Both men and women study as advanced officers and NCOs in the university.\n\nAs part of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia, this academy trains troops (both officers and NCOs) for the service of the country's civil defence capabilities and disaster response services.\n\nThis institute is the training center for improved training of all male and female MES personnel, and since Saint Petersburg is the historic birthplace of the Russian civil defence services, many graduate here as professionals in civil defence, search and rescue skills and fire prevention.\n\nEstablished on 25 December 1921 and relaunched on August 24, 1992, this training academy of the Russian Federal Security Service is mandated for the enhanced education of all FSS personnel in various fields of law enforcement. Since 2007, Colonel General Victor Ostroukhov is its commandant.\n\nEstablished in the 1930s, the institute educates all service personnel of the Border Guard Service of Russia (part of the FSS), officers and NCOs, on border security and policing in the wide Russian border.\n\nIt trains the future officers and NCO's of the various service fields of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, especially in border protection and federal security.\n\nSpecial Construction Agency Institute: see .\n\nOpened in 1964, the MTU-FASC serves as the main training school for service personnel of the Federal Agency for Special Construction in construction techniques, mechanical engineering and construction engineering to train them to become full-time military engineers in all sectors of the construction industry.\n\nThe Lenin Military-Political Academy () specialized in training political officers for the Soviet Armed Forces, and until 1942, political commissars for the Armed Forces. After a number of reorganizations, it was in 1994 merged with the \"Military Institute of Foreign Languages\" and the \"Armed Forces Humanities Academy\" into the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation which offers cadets (both officers and NCOs) various courses and postgraduate studies.\n\nThe Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy named after Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky was founded in Moscow in 1920 to train engineers for the Soviet Air Force as well as lecturers and scientists for military academies and research institutions. The main facility of this academy is located on the Leningrad Prospekt immediately across from the Moscow Central Airfield. Course of instruction length is five years. In addition to being an institution of higher learning, it also is a scientific center for working out problems in the areas of aviation technology, its maintenance, and combat utilization. Since 2008, the Gagarin Air Academy is a part of the school apparatus, and both have become the \"Gagarin-Zhukovsky Military Combined Air Force Academy\", with its Moscow main campus retained.\n\n"}

These lands are themselves part of of open spaces.\n\nMerrill Creek is connected to the Delaware River, about three miles away, by a tunnel. The earthen Merrill Creek Dam (National ID # NJ00864), with a height of 280 feet and a length at its crest of 1140 feet, was built in 1988 by a consortium of seven electric utilities, under mandate of the Delaware River Basin Commission. It replaces the river water lost through evaporation in the cooling of 14 power plants. The owners, known as the Merrill Creek Owners Group, are Public Service Electric and Gas, which built the reservoir for the group; Jersey Central Power and Light, Atlantic City Electric, Metropolitan Edison, Philadelphia Electric, Pennsylvania Power and Light, and Delmarva Power and Light.\n\nThe reservoir draws water from the Delaware in springtime, when river flow normally is abundant, and restores it in the summer, when the flow is usually meager and – compounding the problem – demand for electricity for air-conditioning is high. In addition, by maintaining an ample Delaware River flow, seawater intrusion into the aquifers that provide drinking water to many South Jersey communities, including Camden, will be minimized. Construction cost $217 million and was one of the largest construction projects in the United States in 1986-87. The entire site was cleared of dense forest by huge tree-eating machines, and construction crews worked two 12-hour shifts to build a large earth dam and two dikes.\n\nLaunching facilities are provided for recreational boating, but no gasoline motors are allowed. The reservoir and surrounding parkland offer visitors an opportunity to engage in outdoor activity. Some of the abundant wildlife around the lake includes bald eagles, crows, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other various migratory birds. The reservoir is best known for its brown trout fishing. Other fish in the reservoir include walleye, yellow perch, small and largemouth bass, chain pickerel, crappie, catfish, sunfish, carp, rainbow trout, brook trout and lake trout.\n\nThe lake is about two hundred thirty-five feet deep, making it the deepest man-made lake in New Jersey. The depth allows for lake trout to exist and other trout to exist year round. This is one of two lakes in New Jersey where lake trout exist. The other is Round Valley Reservoir in Hunterdon County.\n\nThe lake's visitor center features natural history and cultural exhibits and offers environmental education programs for all age groups ranging from pre-K through adults.\n\n"}

{"id": "2153802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153802", "title": "KXLY (AM)", "text": "KXLY (AM)\n\nKXLY \"920 News Now\" is a news/talk radio outlet based in Spokane, Washington. The station, which operates at 920 kHz on the AM dial and has a translator at 100.7 MHz on the FM dial, offers a lineup of local and national news stories and syndicated talk shows. KXLY also share a website and news resources with sister station KXLY-TV. It is the flagship station of The Cougar Sports Radio Network, broadcast Washington State Cougar football and men's basketball games. It is also the alternate affiliate of the Seattle Mariners baseball network. KXLY is owned by Morgan Murphy Media.\n\nKXLY, Spokane's oldest radio station, was founded as KFDC by Thomas W. Symons, Jr. and Edmund B. Craney in 1922. Symons was the owner of Radio Supply Co. in Spokane, and Craney had been his employee.\n\nCraney, a 17-year-old member of the North Central High School radio club, had a desire to give Spokane residents something to listen to on the radios for which Radio Supply Co. had been selling crystal parts. He persuaded Symons to start a station.\n\nAfter Craney received his broadcasting license, KFDC went on the air on October 18, 1922. The station had no permanent frequency position during its early days. As radio was considered a new frontier (the FCC wouldn't even be founded until 1934) and moderately regulated, Craney would have to search each night for a clean frequency (without interference from stations from distant towns) and broadcast from there.\n\nThe station, which changed its call letters to KFPY in 1924, was housed in the Symons Building on 7 S. Howard Street in Spokane. Beginning in 1925, audience members were welcomed to view live broadcasts—usually music programs or dramas—at \"The Golden Concert Studios of KFPY\" on the second floor, which boasted a curtain, a stage and seating for 150. On the stage were two grand pianos and a Wurlitzer Organ.\n\nIt was through these facilities that Bing Crosby, then an unknown Gonzaga University student, made his radio debut. Decades later, Crosby would partner with the station to launch KXLY-TV.\n\nOther unknowns who performed at the Golden Studios include Bob Crosby and Patrice Munsel.\n\nKFDC/KFPY changed its frequency six times between 1927 and 1941: 1100, 1220, 1390, 1340 and 890 were all home to the station at different points during the 14-year span. It wasn’t until 1941 that the station moved to its current location, 920 kHz.\n\nCraney left the station in 1927 to found KGIR in Butte, Montana, but returned to Spokane in 1945 to buy KFPY, which he rechristened KXLY in 1946. The new call letters reflected Craney’s \"XL Network,\" a chain of stations he also owned in Butte, Helena, Bozeman, Great Falls and Missoula—all of which had call letters beginning with \"KXL.\"\n\nIn November 1953, Craney sold KXLY and KXLY-TV to the Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation, headed by Joseph Harris, Norman Eisenstein, and Richard E. Jones. Northern Pacific sold the KXLY stations (which now included KXLY-FM) in 1961 to current owners, Morgan Murphy Media.\n\nKXLY was affiliated with CBS Radio Network from 1927 until September 1998, at which point CBS moved to KGA and KXLY picked up ABC to match its television counterpart’s affiliation, which had made the switch 22 years earlier in 1976 after CBS severed ties with the TV station.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, KXLY added a translator on 100.3 FM. In April 2016, the translator moved to 100.7 FM.\n\n"}
{"id": "2153806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153806", "title": "WCCO (AM)", "text": "WCCO (AM)\n\nWCCO (830 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and owned by Entercom. Its offices and studios are located in the Entercom Building at 625 Second Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis. WCCO features talk radio, news, and sports programming, with local hosts heard most hours of the day and evening. World and national news are supplied by CBS News Radio. Overnight, WCCO carries the syndicated CBS Sports Radio network. \n\nWCCO is a Class A clear-channel station. With 50,000 watts of power, and a nondirectional signal, WCCO reaches a wide area of North America at night. The transmitter is located off Coon Rapids Boulevard at Lily Street NW in Coon Rapids.\n\nWCCO first signed on the air on September 4, 1922 as WLAG, known as \"the Call of the North\". The studios were in the Nicollet Hotel near Loring Park in Minneapolis. The station soon had financial trouble and closed in 1924. Washburn Crosby Company, forerunner of General Mills, took over the station and switched the call sign to WCCO for the company's initials. Broadcasts resumed less than 2 months later on October 2, 1924, from its current transmitter site in Coon Rapids, and with studios still in the Nicollet Hotel.\n\nIn 1927, WCCO was one of the original 21 stations of the NBC Red Network. It carried NBC's slate of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows, and big-band broadcasts during the \"Golden Age of Radio\". CBS bought WCCO from General Mills in 1932, and switched its network affiliation to the CBS Radio network. It remains a CBS affiliate.\n\nIn 1952, CBS sold majority control of WCCO to the Murphy and McNally families, who formed Midwest Radio and Television as a holding company for WCCO radio and its new co-owned television station, Channel 4 WCCO-TV. CBS was forced to sell off its stake in the WCCO stations in 1954 due to Federal Communications Commission ownership limits in effect at the time. CBS reacquired the WCCO stations outright in 1992 when Midwest Radio and Television merged with the network.\n\nIn the 1950s, as network programming was shifting from radio to television, WCCO switched to a full-service middle-of-the-road format, including popular music, news, sports, and talk. Robert Ridder became president of WCCO in 1952.\n\nIn the 1980s, the playlist shifted from middle-of-the-road music toward adult contemporary. The music was gradually phased out by the early 1990s, when the format was changed to news, talk, and sports. From 1947 to 1996, WCCO and WCCO-TV won 12 George Foster Peabody Awards, more than any other Twin Cities broadcast outlet. \n\nIn the early days of radio, WCCO was a powerful force in the development of better and more powerful transmitters. On November 11, 1928, with the implementation of the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, WCCO changed its frequency to 810 kHz and was granted clear-channel status. It began broadcasting with 50,000 watts for the first time in September 1932. In the 1930s, two additional 300-foot towers were added to increase the range of the station's signal.\n\nWCCO constructed a new 654-foot tower in Coon Rapids in 1939. This is the same tower used today, although the broadcast frequency was changed to 830 kHz as a result of the 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement-.\n\nDue to the station's power, as well as Minnesota's landscape, WCCO boasts one of the largest coverage areas in the country. During the day, it provides at least B-grade coverage to almost all of Minnesota (as far north as Duluth and as far south as Rochester), plus large portions of Iowa and Wisconsin. Under the right conditions, it reaches into portions of North Dakota, South Dakota and Illinois.\n\nAt night, the station's signal typically reaches across 28 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. Certain conditions can make the signal reach much farther. Legendary station personality Howard Viken says that he once picked up the station while he was in the military during World War II, stationed at Guadalcanal in 1943.\n\nWCCO has a longtime reputation of being the station to tune in for emergency information, especially severe weather and school closings in winter. Listeners would call in during severe weather events and describe what they were seeing at their locations, supplementing information from the National Weather Service. For many years, WCCO was famous for its \"klaxon\" alert tone for tornado warnings. WCCO is also a PEP station for the Emergency Alert System.\n\nFor a series of live public-service emergency broadcasts in 1965 – the St. Patrick's Day blizzard, the record April floods on the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, and the May 6 onslaught of 24 tornado touchdowns in the Twin Cities area – the station earned the George Foster Peabody, DuPont, and Sigma Delta Chi awards.\n\nWCCO engineers were experimenting with frequency modulation by 1939, operating W9XHW at 42.3 MHz, but at just 50 watts. With only a handful of Minneapolis residents owning an FM radio, WCCO did not rush into FM broadcasting. As late as 1969, WCCO-FM was broadcasting at 2,700 watts atop the 450-foot Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis, and only for the minimum number of hours required to keep its FCC license. Meanwhile, several local FM stations had already boosted their power to 100,000 watts and were airing new formats on FM, such as beautiful music and progressive rock.\n\nFinally in 1973, WCCO-FM station moved its antenna to 1,250 feet near the top of the Shoreview, Minnesota, Twin Cities antenna farm, with a power of 100,000 watts. A full day's programming of music and a large news operation could be heard clearly for 150 miles in all directions. By the late 1970s, WCCO-FM 103 had come into its own and established an identity separate from AM 830, with a popular adult contemporary/soft rock sound. In 1983, it became WLTE 102.9 Lite-FM, an identity it kept until Christmas 2011, when it switched to a country music format as BUZ'N @ 102.9 with the new call letters KMNB.\n\nWCCO was the top-rated station in the Twin Cities for decades until shifting demographics and a decline in listening to AM radio caused a drop in the Arbitron and Nielsen ratings. Several FM stations, including classic rock 92.5 KQRS-FM and Top 40 101.3 KDWB-FM were able to overtake it. One sign of the changing times: the well-known farm report was dropped in early 2004, reflecting the fact that many farmers began to rely more on the Internet for such information and that the number of farmers in Minnesota has drastically shrunk since the station first began broadcasting (although agriculture remains vital to the region).\n\nIn August 2008, as a cosmetic change to make WCCO in sync with other CBS talk radio stations, the station changed from \"News/Talk 8•3•0 WCCO\" to \"News Radio 8•3•0 WCCO.\" On September 15, 2011, WCCO was awarded the NAB Marconi Radio Award for Large Market Station of the Year.\n\nWCCO became the radio home of Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team starting with the 2011–2012 season, acquiring the broadcast rights from rival AM 1130 KFAN. WCCO started broadcasting University of St. Thomas football beginning in the 2011–2012 season. Games are hosted by David Lee. WCCO was the former home of University of Minnesota Golden Gophers athletics and Minnesota Wild hockey. WCCO had been the radio flagship of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1961–69, 1976–84, 1988–90, and 1996–2000.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins had been heard on WCCO since arriving in the Twin Cities in 1961, but because of a dispute between WCCO parent company CBS and XM Satellite Radio over compensation for its Major League Baseball broadcasts, CBS did not renew many of its MLB contracts. WCCO resumed broadcasting the Minnesota Twins in 2018.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio agreed to merge with Entercom. The sale was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust to shield the deal from taxes. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity. WCCO Radio is no longer co-owned with WCCO-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nIn 2018, WCCO returned to the moniker \"News/Talk 8•3•0 WCCO\" with its logo reflecting the change. \n\nOn January 1st, 2020, WCCO dropped hourly CBS newscasts but continues to be an affiliate of the network. \n\nWCCO broadcasters were known across the Midwest. Perhaps the greatest of them all was Cedric Adams, who first was heard on WCCO in 1931, and broadcast on the station until his death in 1961. Pilots flying over the Upper Midwest reported watching the lights go out all over the region each night when Adams finished his 10 pm newscast. Howard Viken, Maynard Speece, Charlie Boone and Roger Erickson, Jergen Nash, Joyce Lamont, and Randy Merriman became household names. When broadcaster Steve Cannon \"the Iron Ranger\" and his cast of characters arrived at WCCO from AM 1500 KSTP in 1971, he was still thought of by many as the \"new guy\" nearly until his retirement 26 years later.\n\nFor several years, WCCO has hosted a weekly radio show with the governor of Minnesota. Former Governor Jesse Ventura had a show while in office, and successor Tim Pawlenty followed suit. \nEleanor Mondale, the daughter of former Senator and Vice President Walter Mondale, started her career in radio at the station in 1989 as the entertainment reporter, but left after 8 months. She returned to Minnesota in 2006 to co-host a weekday morning show on WCCO-AM with Susie Jones.\n\nMore recent WCCO personalities have included longtime \"Star Tribune\" columnist Sid Hartman, \"Whole-Lotta Woman\" Ruth Koscielak and Tim Russell, who had been a cast member on Garrison Keillor's \"A Prairie Home Companion\", heard on NPR for many years. Some notable sports broadcasters have included Baseball Hall of Fame member Herb Carneal, the longtime voice of the Minnesota Twins, Halsey Hall, Ray Scott and Ray Christensen, longtime voice of University of Minnesota's Gopher football and Gopher men's basketball.\n\nAfter nearly a year of work to outfit the station and prepare programming in stereo, on October 2, 1985, WCCO began broadcasting in AM stereo using the Motorola C-QUAM system. The move by the large market dominating WCCO to adopt AM stereo received attention from local and national news outlets. WCCO discontinued broadcasting in AM stereo around the turn of the millennium.\n\nIn 2005, WCCO began broadcasting its signal in the HD Radio format. WCCO programming is also simulcast on KMNB-FM 102.9-HD2. In March 2018, WCCO shut down its HD radio signal on AM 830.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2153809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153809", "title": "Seating capacity", "text": "Seating capacity\n\nSeating capacity is the number of people who can be seated in a specific space, in terms of both the physical space available, and limitations set by law. Seating capacity can be used in the description of anything ranging from an automobile that seats two to a stadium that seats hundreds of thousands of people. The largest sporting venue in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity for more than 235,000 people and infield seating that raises capacity to an approximate 400,000.\n\nSafety is a primary concern in determining the seating capacity of a venue: \"Seating capacity, seating layouts and densities are largely dictated by legal requirements for the safe evacuation of the occupants in the event of fire\". The International Building Code specifies, \"In places of assembly, the seats shall be securely fastened to the floor\" but provides exceptions if the total number of seats is fewer than 100, if there is a substantial amount of space available between seats or if the seats are at tables. It also delineates the number of available exits for interior balconies and galleries based on the seating capacity, and sets forth the number of required wheelchair spaces in a table derived from the seating capacity of the space.\n\nThe International Fire Code, portions of which have been adopted by many jurisdictions, is directed more towards the use of a facility than the construction. It specifies, \"For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length\". It also requires that every public venue submit a detailed site plan to the local fire code official, including \"details of the means of egress, seating capacity, [and] arrangement of the seating...\"\n\nOnce safety considerations have been satisfied, determinations of seating capacity turn on the total size of the venue, and its purpose. For sports venues, the \"decision on maximum seating capacity is determined by several factors. Chief among these are the primary sports program and the size of the market area\". In motion picture venues, the \"limit of seating capacity is determined by the maximal viewing distance for a given size of screen\", with image quality for closer viewers declining as the screen is expanded to accommodate more distant viewers.\n\nSeating capacity of venues also plays a role in what media they are able to provide and how they are able to provide it. In contracting to permit performers to use a theatre or other performing space, the \"seating capacity of the performance facility must be disclosed\". Seating capacity may influence the kind of contract to be used and the royalties to be given. The seating capacity must also be disclosed to the copyright owner in seeking a license for the copyrighted work to be performed in that venue.\n\nVenues that may be leased for private functions such as ballrooms and auditoriums generally advertise their seating capacity. Seating capacity is also an important consideration in the construction and use of sports venues such as stadiums and arenas. When entities such as the National Football League's Super Bowl Committee decide on a venue for a particular event, seating capacity, which reflects the possible number of tickets that can be sold for the event, is an important consideration.\n\nSeating capacity differs from \"total capacity\" (sometimes called \"public capacity\"), which describes the total number of people who can fit in a venue or in a vehicle either sitting or standing. Where seating capacity is a legal requirement, however, as it is in movie theatres and on aircraft, the law reflects the fact that the number of people allowed in should not exceed the number who can be seated.\n\nUse of the term \"public capacity\" indicates that a venue is allowed to hold more people than it can actually seat. Again, the maximum total number of people can refer to either the physical space available or limitations set by law.\n\n"}

Established in 1875, Huston–Tillotson University was the first institution of higher learning in Austin. The university is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, the United Church of Christ, and the United Negro College Fund. Huston–Tillotson University awards bachelor's degrees in business, education, the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, science, and technology and a Master's degree in educational leadership. The university also offers alternative teacher certification and academic programs for undergraduates interested in pursuing post-graduate degrees in law and medicine.\n\nThe history of Huston - Tillotson University lies in two schools: Tillotson College and Samuel Huston College.\n\nTillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute was chartered as a coeducational school in 1877 by the American Missionary Society of Congregational churches and its namesake, George Jeffrey Tillotson. It opened on January 17, 1881 and had 12 presidents: \"William E. Brooks, first president (1881-85), was succeeded by John Hershaw (1886), Henry L. Lubbell (1886-1889), William M. Brown (1889-93), Winfield S. Goss (1894-95), Marshall R. Gaines (1896-1904), Arthur W. Partch (1905-06), Isaac M. Agard (1907-18), and Francis W. Fletcher (1919-23). J. T. Hodges, the first African American to be president (1924-29), was followed by Mary E. Branch (1930-44) and William H. Jones, who became president in 1944.\" Tillotson College was a women's college from 1926 to 1935.\n\nSamuel Huston College developed out of an 1876 Methodist Episcopal conference. An 1883 agreement with the Freedmen's Aid Society led to the development of the college. The college was named after Samuel Huston of Marengo, Iowa and the college opened in 1900.\n\nOn October 24, 1952 Tillotson College and Samuel Huston College merged to form Huston-Tillotson College. It then became Huston–Tillotson University on February 28, 2005.\n\nBefore the merger, future baseball legend Jackie Robinson accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs who was president of the college, to be the athletic director at Samuel Huston College, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC).\n\nBefore joining the Kansas City Monarchs, Robinson coached the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season.

In 1931 he was regarded as 'one of the world's foremost black and white artists', and in 1980, 'Australia's greatest cartoonist'.\n\nWill Dyson was part of a literary family, with journalist and writer brother Edward 'Ted' Dyson (1865–1931), illustrator brother Ambrose Dyson (1876–1913), and three sisters also of artistic praise. His parents George and Jane came from England. \n\nDyson was a boxer of some note in the 1900s.\n\nArtist Norman Lindsay was part of his social and professional circle and in 1909, Dyson, Lindsay, and Lindsay's illustrator sister Ruby, moved to London. Dyson went to work with the \"London Daily Herald\". In 1910 he married Ruby. (Will's sister Jean later married Norman and Ruby's brother Lionel.) She died as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919. He returned to Australia in 1925, but for the 'mediocrity' of Melbourne, he then went to New York, and then returned London. \n\nDyson died suddenly but peacefully relaxed in an armchair on 21 January 1938, aged 55 of heart failure. He was survived by their only child, daughter Betty (1911–1956), a noted artistic designer. \n\nBefore moving from Australia to London, Dyson was a caricaturist for \"The Bulletin\" and occasionally for Melbourne's \"Herald\" newspaper, he drew with a 'cruel and biting' style.\n\nDuring World War I, Dyson became known for his war cartoons, with a satiric tone. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and sent to the Western Front, the 'mission was to make characteristic drawings of life in the trenches', making him Australia's first war artist. The frontline experience impacted him, changing his cartooning direction from the militarists to the 'sufferers'. Dyson later engaged in a debate with General Sir John Monash about his drawing of Diggers:\n\nEnglish writer H. G. Wells (1866–1946) was part of his professional circle. He returned to Australia from 1925 to 1930, to the about-to-be-sold \"Melbourne Punch\". He later was the chief cartoonist for the \"Daily Herald\" in London.\n\nIt was shortly after his wife's death in 1919 that he drew what was to become one of the most celebrated and widely reproduced of all cartoons, entitled 'Peace and Future Cannon Fodder', and astonishing in its uncanny foresight. Published in the British \"Daily Herald\" on 13 May 1919, it showed David Lloyd George, Vittorio Orlando and Georges Clemenceau (the Prime Ministers of Britain, Italy and France respectively), together with Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, emerging after a meeting at Versailles to discuss the Peace Treaty. Clemenceau, who was identified by his nickname 'The Tiger' is saying to the others: 'Curious! I seem to hear a child weeping!'. And there, behind a pillar, is a child in tears; labelled '1940 Class'.\n\nDyson's friend and colleague Charles Bean suggested that the Australian War Memorial should have a special Dyson gallery, so high was his respect for Dyson's work. In 2016, the Memorial held more than 270 of Dyson's works, but had none of them on display.\n\n"}

Guns is the self-titled debut studio album by American hard rock band L.A. Guns. Recorded at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, it was produced by Jim Faraci and released on January 4, 1988 by Vertigo Records. The album is the only L.A. Guns release to feature drummer Nickey \"Beat\" Alexander, who was replaced by Steve Riley before it was released. \"One More Reason\", \"Sex Action\" and \"Electric Gypsy\" were released as the three singles from the album.\n\nMaterial for the debut L.A. Guns release was drawn from the band's formative years. Songwriting credits were listed for all five band members, as well as former lead vocalist Paul Black. The album also includes cover versions of two songs by members' former projects. Early demo recordings of several songs were included on \"\", while the reunited classic lineup of the band re-recorded a number of tracks for \"Greatest Hits and Black Beauties\".\n\n\"L.A. Guns\" was a minor domestic commercial success. The album spent 33 weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart, peaking at number 50 in April 1988. It was also certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1993, certifying sales in excess of 500,000 units. Media response to \"L.A. Guns\" was generally positive. Critics highlighted the album as a standout of the 1980s \"hair metal\" scene, praising the balance of commercial compositions and heavier tracks.\n\nL.A. Guns signed a recording contract with major label PolyGram in 1987, and changed its lineup significantly at the same time. Lead vocalist Paul Black was replaced with former Girl and Tormé frontman Phil Lewis, former Faster Pussycat member Kelly Nickels joined on bass, and previous bassist Mick Cripps moved over to rhythm guitar to replace Robert Stoddard. The band commenced recording for its self-titled debut album in June. Recalling the process, Lewis reported that \"We got the whole thing done in six weeks\", adding that \"we like that Sex Pistols type of edge and energy, so we decided to get in and out of the studio as quickly as possible.\" Sessions took place at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles with producer Jim Faraci, who had most recently worked with glam metal bands Poison, Lizzy Borden and Ratt.\n\nPrior to its release, 1,500 advance copies of \"L.A. Guns\" were sent to rock clubs, music retailers and radio stations. PolyGram's Steve Kleinberg commented at the time that \"We wanted to create a ground swell, and it seems to be working. Our preorders on the album are more than 65,000, and a number of major retailers have yet to place their orders.\" \"One More Reason\", \"Sex Action\" and \"Electric Gypsy\" were released as singles, all with music videos directed by Ralph Ziman. Videos were also produced for \"One Way Ticket\" and \"Cry No More\" by Phillip Detchmendy, and for \"Bitch Is Back\", \"No Mercy\" and \"Nothing to Lose\" by Ziman and Katy Lynne. The album was promoted on a three-month United States concert tour starting on January 15, 1988, including dates supporting Ted Nugent and AC/DC.\n\nAll five members of the band are credited for songwriting on \"L.A. Guns\". The majority of songs were written by lead guitarist Tracii Guns with Lewis, while some feature co-writing credits for former vocalist Black. The album also features cover versions of Lewis's former band Girl's \"Hollywood Tease\", and Nickels's former band Sweet Pain's \"Shoot for Thrills\". \"L.A. Guns\" is the only studio album by the band to feature drummer Nickey \"Beat\" Alexander, who was replaced by Steve Riley before it was released. In 1999, the reunited \"classic lineup\" of the band recorded new versions of several songs for \"Greatest Hits and Black Beauties\". \"Sex Action\" was also later included on the 2002 release \"Ultimate L.A.

Guns\" debuted at number 138 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It spent a total of 33 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 50 in April. In 1993, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for domestic sales in excess of 500,000 certified units. Outside of the US, the album reached number 88 on the \"RPM\" Canadian Albums Chart, number 67 on the Japanese Albums Chart, and number 73 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nMedia response to \"L.A. Guns\" was generally positive. \"Billboard\" magazine noted that the album \"evinces a hard but often pop-conscious sound\", predicting that L.A. Guns would prove popular with fans of groups like Bon Jovi. The review added that the songwriting on the album was \"unspectacular\", but concluded that \"energy's there, and that counts in this genre\". \"Cash Box\" magazine outlined that the band was \"creating quite a stir at both radio and retail\", suggesting that \"L.A. Guns\" would \"push [the] band into the forefront of the national rock scene\". \"Hit Parader\" called it \"a nasty, naughty, noxious notion of what an L.A. band is all about\". In a retrospective review of the album, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia described \"L.A. Guns\" as \"a wildly over-the-top rock and roll album\", praising it for \"rock[ing] with a bile and fury not seen since Mötley Crüe's \"Shout at the Devil\"\". Rivadavia also highlighted the balance between \"Shit-kicking anthems\" such as \"No Mercy,\" \"Sex Action\" and \"Bitch Is Back\", and \"more commercial but equally hot offerings\" such as \"Electric Gypsy\" and \"Down in the City\".\n\nL.A.

{"id": "2153834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153834", "title": "Transnistria War", "text": "Transnistria War\n\nThe Transnistria War was an armed conflict that broke out in November 1990 in Dubăsari (, \"Dubossary\") between pro-Transnistria forces, including the Transnistrian Republican Guard, militia and Cossack units (which were supported by elements of the Russian 14th Army), and pro-Moldovan forces, including Moldovan troops and police. Fighting intensified on 1 March 1992 and, alternating with \"ad hoc\" ceasefires, lasted throughout the spring and early summer of 1992 until a ceasefire was declared on 21 July 1992, which has held. The conflict remained unresolved, but in 2011 talks were held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with Lithuania holding the rotating chairmanship.\n\nBefore the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and the creation of the Moldavian SSR in 1940, the Bessarabian part of Moldova, i.e. the part situated to the west of the river Dniester (Nistru), was part of Romania (1918–1940). The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, that led to the events of 1940, was later denounced by present-day Moldova, which declared it \"null and void\" in its Declaration of Independence in 1991. However, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the territorial changes resulting from it have remained in place.\n\nBefore the creation of the Moldavian SSR, today's Transnistria was part of the Ukrainian SSR, as an autonomous republic called the Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with Tiraspol as its capital (1924–1940). It represents slightly more than one tenth of Moldova's territory.\nDuring the last years of the 1980s, the political landscape of the Soviet Union was changing due to Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, which allowed political pluralism at the regional (republican) level. In the Moldavian SSR, as in many other parts of the Soviet Union, national movements became the leading political force. As these movements exhibited increasingly nationalist sentiments and expressed intent to leave the USSR in favor of uniting with Romania, they encountered growing opposition from among the primarily Russian-speaking ethnic minorities living in the republic. This opposition to the new trends and potential future policies was manifested in a more visible way in Transnistria, where, unlike the rest of the MSSR, ethnic Moldovans (39.9%) were outnumbered by the combined figure of Russians and Ukrainians (53.8%) as per the 1989 Census in Transnistria, largely due to higher immigration during the Soviet Era.\n\nWhile some believe that the combination of a distinct history (especially 1918–1940) and a fear of discrimination by Moldovans, gave rise to separatist sentiments, others believe that ethnic tensions alone fail to account for the dynamics of the conflict. According to John Mackinlay and Peter Cross, who conducted a study based on casualty reports, significant numbers of both Transnistrians and Moldovans fought together on both sides of the conflict. They suggest that the conflict is more political in nature.\n\nOn 31 August 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR enacted two laws. One of them made Moldovan the official language, in lieu of Russian, the \"de facto\" official language of the Soviet Union. It also mentioned a \"linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity\". The second law stipulated the return to the Latin Romanian alphabet. \"Moldovan language\" is the term used in the former Soviet Union for a virtually identical dialect of the Romanian language during 1940–1989. On 27 April 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR adopted the traditional tricolour (blue, yellow and red) flag with the Moldavian coat of arms and changed the national anthem to \"Deșteaptă-te, române!\", the national anthem of Romania since 1989. Later that year (1990) the words \"Soviet\" and \"Socialist\" were dropped and the name of the country was changed to \"Republic of Moldova\".\n\nThese events, as well as the end of the Ceaușescu regime in neighboring Romania in December 1989 and the partial opening of the border between Romania and Moldova on 6 May 1990, led many in Transnistria and Moldova to believe that a union between Moldova and Romania was inevitable. This possibility caused fears among the Russian-speaking population that it would be excluded from most aspects of public life. From September 1989, there were strong scenes of protests in the region against the central government's ethnic policies. The protests developed into the formation of secessionist movements in Gagauzia and Transnistria, which initially sought autonomy within the Moldavian SSR, in order to retain Russian and Gagauz as official languages. As the nationalist-dominated Moldovan Supreme Soviet outlawed these initiatives, the Gagauz Republic and Transnistria declared independence from Moldova and announced their application to be reattached to the Soviet Union as independent federal republics.\n\nThe language laws presented a particularly volatile issue as a great proportion of the non-Moldovan population of the Moldavian SSR did not speak Moldovan (Romanian). The problem of the official language in the MSSR had become a Gordian knot, being exaggerated and, perhaps, intentionally politicized. Some described the language laws as \"discriminatory\" and criticized their rapid implementation. Others, on the contrary, complained the laws were not followed.\n\nOn 2 September 1990, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed; \"Pridnestrovie\" being the name for Transnistria in Russian. On 22 December 1990 president Gorbachev signed a decree that declared void the decisions of the \"Second Congress of People Deputies of Transnistria\" from 2 September. For two months, Moldovan authorities refrained from taking action against this proclamation. Transnistria became one of the \"unrecognized republics\" that appeared throughout the USSR, alongside Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh. These self-proclaimed states maintained close ties with each other.\n\nOne of the first clashes between the Moldovan government and separatists occurred on 2 November 1990 in Dubăsari. Local women stormed the Court and Prosecutor's Office and stayed there for several hours. A police detachment was then dispatched to clear a roadblock placed by the city residents on the bridge over the river Dniester that effectively cut the city off from the central government. After being prevented from clearing the roadblock, policemen opened fire, with three residents of Dubăsari being killed and 13 were wounded, resulting in the first casualties of the conflict.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failure of the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, on 27 August 1991, the Moldovan parliament adopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova. The declaration referred to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as \"null and void\" and viewed Moldova's Independence as an act of elimination of \"the political and legal consequences of the above\", declaring that the establishment of the Moldavian SSR on the territories of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, Hertza region and the Moldavian ASSR was made in absence of \"any real legal basis\". The PMR interpreted this as meaning that the 1940-merger of the two sides of the Dniester river was dissolved. Moldova, however, did not agree, as large portions of the territory occupied in 1940 by USSR remain in Ukraine, and almost immediately took steps to assert its sovereignty over the full territory of the now-former MSSR.\n\nAt that time, the Republic of Moldova did not have its own army and the first attempts to create one took place in early 1992 in response to the escalating conflict. The newly independent Moldovan parliament asked the defunct government of the USSR \"to begin negotiations with the Moldovan government in order to put an end to the illegal occupation of the Republic of Moldova and withdraw Soviet troops from Moldovan territory\".\n\nWhen, on 29 August 1991, Transnistria's independence leader Igor Smirnov and three other deputies arrived in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, to meet Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk. Smirnov and Andrei Cheban were arrested by Moldova's police and immediately transported to a prison in Moldova. In protest, the women's strike committee headed by Galina Andreeva blocked the Moscow–Chișinău railway line at a waypoint between Bender and Tiraspol, until the arrested were freed by the president of Moldova Mircea Snegur in an attempt to quell the spirits.\n\nIn late 1991, policemen in Tiraspol and Rîbnița swore allegiance to the PMR.\n\nBy 1992, Moldova had troops under the Ministry of the Interior. On 17 March 1992, they started recruiting troops for the newly created Ministry of Defence. By July 1992, total Moldovan troop strength has been estimated at 25,000–35,000, including called-up police officers, conscripts, reservists and volunteers, especially from the Moldavian localities near the conflict zone.\n\nIn addition to Soviet weaponry inherited upon independence, Moldova also obtained arms from Romania. Romania also sent military advisors and volunteers to aid Moldova during the conflict.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian 14th Guards Army in Moldovan territory numbered about 14,000 professional soldiers. The PMR authorities had 9,000 militiamen trained and armed by officers of the 14th Army. The volunteers came from the Russian Federation: a number of Don, Kuban, Orenburg, Sibir and local Transnistrian Black Sea Cossacks joined in to fight alongside the separatists. Due to the irregular makeup of the forces, troop strength of the PMR is in dispute, but it is believed that during March it numbered around 12,000.\n\nForces of the 14th Army (which had owed allegiance to the USSR, CIS and the Russian Federation in turn) stationed in Transnistria, had fought with and on behalf of the PMR forces. A significant portion of the personnel of the Russian 14th Army were local conscripts and officers that had been given local residence. PMR units were able to arm themselves with weapons taken from the stores of the former 14th Army. The Russian troops chose not to oppose the PMR units who had come to help themselves from the Army's stores; on the contrary, in many cases they helped the PMR troops equip themselves by handing over weapons and by opening up the ammunition stores to them.\n\nIn December 1991, the Moldovan authorities arrested Lieutenant-General Yakovlev in Ukrainian territory, accusing him of helping the PMR forces to arm themselves by using the weapons stocks of the 14th Army. At that time, General Yakovlev has been both Commander of the 14th Army and \"Head of the National Defence and Security Department\" of the PMR. The government of the Russian Federation interceded with the Moldovan government to obtain the release of General Yakovlev in exchange for 26 policemen detained by PMR forces at the start of the fighting in Dubăsari.\n\nOn 5 April 1992, Vice-President Rutskoy of Russia, in a speech delivered to 5,000 people in Tiraspol, encouraged the Transnistrian people to obtain their independence.\n\nThe first fatalities in the emerging conflict took place on 2 November 1990, two months after the PMR's 2 September 1990 declaration of independence. Moldovan forces entered Dubăsari in order to separate Transnistria into two halves, but were stopped by the city's inhabitants, who had blocked the bridge over the Dniester, at Lunga. In an attempt to break through the roadblock, Moldovan forces then opened fire. In the course of the confrontation, three Dubăsari locals, Oleg Geletiuk, Vladimir Gotkas and Valerie Mitsuls, were killed by the Moldovan forces and sixteen people wounded.\n\nA second Moldovan attempt to cross the Lunga bridge took place on 13 December 1991. As a result of the fighting, 27 PMR troops were taken prisoner and four Moldovan troops (Ghenadie Iablocikin, Gheorghe Cașu, Valentin Mereniuk and Mihai Arnăut) were killed, without Moldova being able to cross the bridge. After this second failed attempt, there was a lull in military activity until 2 March 1992, considered the official start date of the War of Transnistria. This day was the same day when Moldova was admitted as a member of the United Nations, i.e. received full international recognition of its August 27, 1991 declaration of independence. The armed conflict lasted until 21 July 1992, in three areas along the Dniester river.\n\nThe first area of military action was on the eastern shore of the Dniester river, from north to south, the villages of Molovata Nouă, Cocieri (approx 6,000 inhabitants), Corjova and the city of Dubăsari (approx 30,000 inhabitants), together forming a contiguous mainly inhabited area 10–12 km along the shore. The only connection to the western bank from the three villages is either a ferry, or two bridges in Dubăsari.\n\nOn 1 March 1992 Igor Shipcenko, the PMR militia chief of Dubăsari, was killed by a teenager and Moldovan police were accused of the killing. Although minor, this incident was a sufficient spark for the already very tense situation to blow up and cause the conflict to escalate.\n\nIn response, the Cossacks who came from Rostov-on-Don to support the PMR side stormed the police precinct in Dubăsari during the night. Moldovan president Mircea Snegur, afraid of starting an armed conflict, ordered the 26 policemen to surrender to the attacking Cossacks and PMR forces. They were later exchanged for Lieutenant-General Yakovlev. Moldovan policemen loyal to Chișinău from the Dubăsari raion (district), instead of returning to work in the occupied precinct in Dubăsari, now a milice precinct, gathered in Cocieri.\n\nOn 2 March 1992, locals from Cocieri, after hearing about the situation in Dubăsari, broke into the small local arms depot to arm themselves against the PMR side. Three locals (Alexandru Luchianov from Cocieri, Alexandru Gazea from Molovata and Mihai Nour from Roghi) were killed, but the military unit from Cocieri was defeated by the Moldovans. The officers and their families were forced to leave the village. More policemen were ferried the following days from the western bank of the Dniester. They organized a defense line around the three villages, while PMR forces retained control of Dubăsari. In the following weeks both PMR and Moldovan forces amassed large numbers in the area and fought a trench war, with intermittent ceasefires.\n\nA similar development occurred on March 13 in the villages of Coșnița, Pîrîta, Pohrebea and Doroțcaia. A second \"bridge-head\" was formed on the eastern bank, now south of Dubăsari.\n\nIn April, Russian vice-president Alexander Rutskoy visited Transnistria and expressed the full support of Transnistrian separatists by Soviet Russia.\n\nA ceasefire was in negotiation during June in the Bendery area. However, the full-scale conflict re-erupted after regular Moldovan forces entered the city of Bendery in an attempt to reestablish the authority of Moldova there. It has been reported that this action was a response to the stand-off at the police station in Bendery on 19 June 1992. On the afternoon of that day, the Moldovan police in Bendery arrested the 14th Army's Major Yermakov on suspicion of planned subversion. After his arrest, PMR guards opened fire on the police station. The Moldovan government ordered its troops to enter the city the following morning. Urban warfare ensued between the two sides in the densely populated city, causing civilian casualties. The Moldovan radio said three Soviet Russian T-64 tanks from the 14th Army, some bearing Russian flags, were destroyed when closing in on central Bendery, two of them by T-12 antitank guns, and a third by a rocket propelled grenade that set its engine on fire. A fourth tank was disabled when its tracks were struck by a rocket propelled grenade. Russian Army spokesmen said the tanks had been seized from depots by separatists. Russian sources reported \"dozens of dead\" in the streets.\n\nThe news of the havoc in Bendery reached Tiraspol, only 11 km away, as Moldovan troops were approaching the crucial bridge over the Dniester. At this point, with the support of ROG's tanks, the Transnistrian Republican Guard and Cossack volunteers rushed to confront the Moldovan forces. Russia Vice-President Rutskoy, in a speech delivered on the main channel of the Russian television, called for all Soviet forces in Tiraspol to storm Bendery. In the course of the following days, parts of the city of Bendery, including the center, were retaken by PMR forces.\n\nOn 22 June 1992, acting on news that troops from the 14th Army were ready to cross the Dniestr and move deep into Moldova, the Moldovan military ordered an airstrike to destroy the bridge between Bendery and Tiraspol. A three MiG-29 package took off from Chisinau, two of them armed with six OFAB-250 bombs each. The other aircraft was a MiG-29UB providing cover. No direct hits were achieved on the intended target, but the bridge received some blast and splinter damage from near misses. One of the bombs went astray and fell on a civilian residence, killing a number of people inside. Sources from the 14th Army claimed a second MiG-29 attack on an oil refinery at Tiraspol the following day, in which one aircraft was allegedly shot down by a SA-3 missile, but this sortie was denied by Moldovan authorities.\n\nA ceasefire agreement was signed on 21 July. This official document whose broad lines was established by the Russian side, was signed by the presidents of Russia (Boris Yeltsin) and Moldova (Mircea Snegur). The agreement provided for peacekeeping forces charged with ensuring observance of the ceasefire and security arrangements, composed of five Russian battalions, three Moldovan battalions and two PMR battalions under the orders of a joint military command structure, the Joint Control Commission (JCC).\n\nIt is estimated that in total nearly one thousand people were killed in the conflict, with the number of wounded approaching 3,000. Unlike many other post-Soviet conflicts, IDP's (internally displaced persons) did not reach large numbers in the war of Transnistria.\n\nDays after the truce had been agreed upon, a military confrontation between a local self-defence unit and the Moldovan army, took place in Gîsca (Gyska), a village with an ethnic Russian majority near Bendery. At least three villagers were killed. During the combat, civil buildings were damaged or destroyed by artillery fire. Later reports of ceasefire violations have been brought under control with no known loss of human lives.\n\nThe Russian 14th Army's role in the area was crucial to the outcome of the war. The Moldovan army's position of inferiority prevented it from gaining control of Transnistria. Russia has since disbanded the 14th army and reduced troop strength in Transnistria to a corps of around 1,300 men who form part of the JCC.\n\nWith the PMR's overwhelming military superiority, Moldova had little chance of achieving victory and the fighting was unpopular with the skeptical Moldovan population.\n\nAccording to a Human Rights Center “Memorial” report, local Bendery eyewitnesses on 19 June 1992 saw Moldovan troops in armored vehicles deliberately firing at houses, courtyards and cars with heavy machine guns. The next day, Moldovan troops allegedly shot at civilians that were hiding in houses, trying to escape the city, or helping wounded PMR guardsmen. Other local eyewitnesses testified that in the same day, unarmed men that gathered in the Bendery downtown square in request of the PMR Executive Committee, were fired at from machine guns. HRC observers were told by doctors in Bendery that as a result of heavy fire from Moldovan positions between 19–20 June, they were unable to attend the wounded.\n\nFrom 21–22 June, both sides engaged in intense urban street fighting, which employed the use of tanks, artillery and grenade launchers. Officers from both sides admitted that these actions led to an increase in civilian casualties. During this time period, ambulance cars were fired upon, with both sides accusing each other of the attacks. PMR sources stated that in Bandery, one doctor was killed and several wounded, while six ambulance personnel were wounded in Kaushany.\n\nIn the Moldovan city of Chișinău, HRC Memorial observers interviewed 12 Transnistrian prisoners of war. The prisoners stated that while being initially detained and interrogated in Kaushany, they were severely beaten with clubs and gun buttstocks by Moldovan police, as well as being threatened with firing squads. There were also reports of captured Moldovan policemen, soldiers and volunteers being beaten and tortured by PMR forces.\n\nAlthough the Russian Army officially took the position of neutrality and non-involvement, many of its officers were sympathetic towards the fledgling Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) and some even defected in order to help the PMR side openly. ROG Parcani sapper battalion, under the orders of General Butkevich, went over to the PMR side. This battalion later destroyed the bridges at Dubăsari, Gura Bâcului-Bâcioc and Coșnița. Moldovan forces used aircraft in the village of Parcani (Parkany) and shelled the ROG station there which meant engaging not just PMR but also Russian forces.\n\nIn 1991, PMR paramilitary forces conducted forays into supply depots of the 14th Army, appropriating an unknown but large amount of equipment. With the commanding officer of the 14th Army, General G. I. Yakovlev, openly supporting the newly created PMR, these forays usually met no resistance from army guards, who never faced punishment. Yakovlev eventually participated in the founding of the PMR, served in the PMR Supreme Soviet and accepted the position as the first chairman of the PMR Department of Defense on 3 December 1991, causing the Commander-in-Chief of the CIS armed forces, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, to promptly relieve him of his rank and service in the Russian military. Yakovlev's successor, General Yuriy Netkachev has assumed a more neutral stance in the conflict. However, his attempts at mediation between Chișinău and Tiraspol were largely unsuccessful and the situation escalated to an open military engagement by June 1992. On 23 June, in the wake of a coordinated offensive by Moldovan forces, Major General Alexander Lebed arrived at the 14th Army headquarters with standing orders to inspect the army, prevent the theft of armaments from its depots, stop the ongoing conflict with any means available and ensure the unimpeded evacuation of armaments and Army personnel from Moldovan and through Ukrainian territory. After briefly assessing the situation, he assumed command of the army, relieving Netkachev, and ordered his troops to enter the conflict directly. On 3 July at 03:00, a massive artillery strike from 14th Army formations stationed on left bank of the Dniester obliterated the Moldovan force concentrated in Gerbovetskii forest, near Bendery, effectively ending the military phase of the conflict. A quote attributed to Lebed demonstrates his support of the Transnistrian cause: \"I am proud that we helped and armed Transnistrian guards against Moldovan fascists\". However, he bore no goodwill towards the Transnistrian leadership and frequently denounced them as \"criminals\" and \"bandits\". Another quote attributed to him describes his stance as follows: \"I told the hooligans [separatists] in Tiraspol and the fascists in Chișinău – either you stop killing each other, or else I'll shoot the whole lot of you with my tanks\".\n\nVolunteers from Russia and Ukraine, including Don and Kuban Cossacks fought on Transnistria's side. There is no general consensus on the number of volunteers or the military role they played in the conflict. Estimates range from as low as 200 to as high as 3000.\n\nDuring the Transnistria War, UNA-UNSO members fought alongside Transnistrian separatists against Moldovan government forces in defense of a large ethnic-Ukrainian minority in Transnistria. The incongruous motive of assisting a mostly pro-Russian region was for the \"struggle of Slavs over Moldovan-Romanian aggression.\" Following the war, 50 UNSO members were awarded the PMR \"Defender of Transnistria\" medal.\n\nAccording to Romanian sources, at least one inmate was released from Bendery prison to be enrolled in the Transnistrian Guard.\n\nShortly before the escalation of the conflict in late June 1992, Romania provided military support to Moldova by supplying weaponry, ammunition and armed vehicles, and also by sending military advisers and training Moldovan military and police forces. Volunteers from Romania fought on Moldova's side.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also an Archduke of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia.\n\nRainer was a son of Emperor Leopold II and Empress Maria Luisa, and was thus a younger brother of Emperor Franz II.\n\nAlthough Rainer suffered from a mild form of epilepsy, this did not visibly interfere with his military career.\n\nRainer served as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia from 1818 to 1848. The position made Rainer and his wife the head of the Austrian court at Milan. Rainer politics were increasingly unpopular, the Italians resented him for their lack of political freedom and for collecting revenues with so little benefit to them. \n\nThroughout the 1840s, the political situation worsened to such an extent that in 1847, Metternich resurrected his 1817 plans for an Italian chancellery by sending his right-hand man count Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont to Milan as acting Chancellor of Lombardy–Venetia to restore the Austrian rule while taking over Northern Italy's administration. But only a few months later, Ficquelmont was recalled to Vienna to assume the leadership of the Council of war as the Revolutions of 1848 started.\n\nArchduke Rainer's mistakes as well as the lack of understanding between Rainer and \"Feldmarschall\" Graf Radetzky, were blamed for the disasters of the Italian Revolution of 1848.\n\nHe married at Prague on 28 May 1820 Princess Elisabeth of Savoy (13 April 1800 – 25 December 1856). She was the sister of the Prince of Carignano, who would in 1831 become King of Sardinia as King Charles Albert. She was also a granddaughter of the late former Duke of the Baltic principality of Courland.\n\nChildren included: \n\n\nThe Revolution of 1848 forced Rainer and Elisabeth from the court at Milan; when the insurrection was quelled, Radetzky was named Rainer's successor as Viceroy. Although his children, except Adelheid, are buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna, he and his wife are buried at the Maria Himmelfahrtskirche in Bolzano.\n\nThrough his daughter Adelaide, Rainer is an ancestor of the entire royal family of Italy which reigned from 1861 to 1946.\n\n"}

After its founding in 1948 by Bob Evans (1918–2007), the restaurant chain evolved into a company with the corporate brand name Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (BEF), and eventually set up a separate food division to handle the sale of its products in other markets. The company made several major acquisitions, including Owens Country Sausage in 1987, and was split in January 2017 with the sale of its restaurant division to an affiliate of Golden Gate Capital. BEF Foods remained independently owned until September 2017 when it was sold to Post Holdings.\n\nThe Bob Evans family restaurant chain includes 500 locations in 18 states, mostly in the Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic portion of the United States. The locations are all corporate owned, and none of them are franchised.\n\nThe restaurants feature a country-living theme with a close connection to farms. Breakfast is served from open to close, and most locations sell baked goods, snacks, and small gift items. The company formerly offered pork products and refrigerated side dishes in the retail grocery and food service markets. The distribution of these products, sold under the Bob Evans and Owens Country Sausage brand names, was independent of the restaurant division.\n\nBob Evans Restaurants was founded in 1948 by Bob Evans, when he began processing and packaging sausage for his small diner located in Gallipolis, Ohio. Early operations were based out of his southeastern Ohio farm in Rio Grande. As the reputation of his sausage grew, so did the number of guests that visited his farm to buy it in bulk. Friends and family partnered together to establish Bob Evans Farms, Inc., in 1953. The increased traffic led him to build the first company restaurant at the farm in 1962 that was named \"The Sausage Shop\".\n\nAfter running into a capacity issue fulfilling large orders, Bob Evans contracted with his cousin Tim Evans of the Evans Packing Company to package Bob Evans Sausage products. Another relative, Dan Evans, served as CEO until his retirement in 2000.\nThe company acquired Texas-based Owens Country Sausage in 1987. Owing to trademark issues, the company branded its otherwise identical restaurants in Texas as Owens Restaurants. By January 2006, all Owens restaurants had been closed.\n\nThe company operated a Mexican-themed restaurant called Cantina del Rio in the mid-1990s, a move which founder Bob Evans called \"a disaster\" in 2003.\n\nThe Evans family controlled daily operations of the company until 2000 when Dan Evans retired as CEO. After Dan's retirement, Stewart K. Owens (a former officer of the Owens Country Sausage company and later president of BOBE) assumed control of Bob Evans Farms Inc. as CEO. In 2001, he became chairman of the board. Company profits faltered under Owens' tenure. In August 2005, after corporate profits had dropped in eight of the previous nine quarters, Owens announced his resignation. After operating for several months under interim CEO Larry Corbin, the company hired Steven Davis, former president of Long John Silver's, as CEO in May 2006.\n\nIn July 2004, Bob Evans Farms purchased the California-based Mimi's Cafe restaurant chain (operating under SWH Corporation) for $182 million. Mimi's Cafe had 144 locations throughout the U.S. at the time. They featured casual dining and American food with a French emphasis and decorative elements. Bob Evans Farms sold Mimi's Cafe to the U.S. branch of Groupe Le Duff in 2013.\n\nIn an effort to update the company's image, Bob Evans debuted a new prototype design at their restaurant location in Xenia, Ohio, on August 17, 2009. The new look included flat-screen televisions, free Wi-Fi, curbside carryout services, and redesigned uniforms for staff. Its architecture and interior design drew inspiration from the Bob Evans family farm in southern Ohio in a way that the company called a \"contemporary and relevant twist\".\n\nCEO Steven Davis resigned in December 2014.\n\nIn December 2015, the chain announced its intention to sell 145 properties to Mesirow Financial Holdings Inc. for a total price of $165-175 million.\n\nOn January 24, 2017, Bob Evans Farms announced the sale of its restaurants business unit to the private equity company Golden Gate Capital (owners of Red Lobster and California Pizza Kitchen) for US$565 million plus the assumption of up to US$50 million in liabilities. In addition to the restaurants, Golden Gate Capital also took ownership of the Bob Evans Farm in Bidwell, Ohio, near Rio Grande. Once the sale was finalized, Bob Evans Farms CEO Saed Mohseni moved to Golden Gate Capital to serve as President of the Bob Evans restaurant division. BFF Foods President Mike Townsley became President and CEO of the new Bob Evans Farms, which remains a public company focusing on grocery products such as breakfast sausage and refrigerated side dishes. Net proceeds from the sale to Bob Evans Farms was expected to be between $475 million and $485 million.\n\nOn the same day, Bob Evans Farms entered into an agreement to acquire the Pineland Farms Potato Co. of Mars Hill, Maine, for US$115 million. Pineland Farms is a value-added potato processor, including a potato farm, serving the retail and food service markets; they also operate a cheese processing business. Both the sale of the restaurant division to Golden Gate Capital and the purchase of Pineland Farms Potato Company closed on March 1, 2017.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, Bob Evans Farms announced that it would be acquired by Post Holdings. Post Holdings also announced that upon completion of the acquisition, they would combine their existing Michael Foods refrigerated retail business with that of Bob Evans Farms. This unit would initially operate under the Bob Evans Farms name (before eventually being changed to Post Refrigerated Retail) and would be led by the then-current Bob Evans Farms President and CEO, Mike Townsley. Bob Evans Farms foodservice business would be moved to Michael Foods, and led by division President Jim Dwyer. The sale of Bob Evans Farms to Post Holdings closed on January 12, 2018, at which point Bob Evans Farms stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and the company ceased to exist as an independent organization.\n\n\n"}

It also contains the Business Revitalization Zone of Inglewood.\n\nIt is represented in the Calgary City Council by the Ward 9 councillor, Gian-Carlo Carra.\n\nThe postal code in this area is T2G.\n\nInglewood has the distinction of being Calgary's oldest neighbourhood and it is immediately across the Elbow river from Fort Calgary. The community was established in 1875 after the fort was built. It was developed by a group headed by Acheson Irvine, Major John Stewart and James Macleod. Ninth Avenue (formerly Atlantic Avenue) was probably the first \"main street\" in the city. Today, the neighbourhood is a shopping and arts district. It is also home to the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary, an urban wildlife refuge. Originally known as East Calgary or Brewery Flats, the community was not officially given the name Inglewood until 1911, when it was named after the nearby homestead established by Col. James Walker. (Walker also was responsible for setting aside the lands later used by the bird sanctuary).\n\nThe community was placed under a mandatory evacuation order during the 2013 Alberta floods.\n\nIn the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, Inglewood had a population of living in dwellings, a 2.6% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012.\n\nResidents in this community had a median household income of $47,040 in 2000, and there were 20.8% low income residents living in the neighbourhood. As of 2000, 12.7% of the residents were immigrants. A proportion of 32.8% of the buildings were condominiums or apartments, and 36.2% of the housing was used for renting.\n\nThe district of Inglewood contains or is adjacent to a number of tourist attractions including Fort Calgary Historic Park, the Calgary Zoo, and the historic Deane House. The north boundary of the district is lined by the Bow River pathway.\n\nToday, Inglewood promotes an arts and culture-filled district with more than 100 shops, boutiques, eateries and a host of breweries attracting locals and tourists alike. It has been referred to as Calgary's hub of local music thanks to venues like the Ironwood Stage and Grill (formerly The Garry Theatre), The Blues Can, and the headquarters for the Calgary International Folk Festival.\n\nInglewood is also home to Sunfest, a one-day affair that attracts more than 30,000 people to the community for activities such as outdoor shopping, live musical performances and a country-themed celebrity pie-eating competition. Sunfest is generally held on the last Saturday in July each year. Since 2007, Inglewood has hosted the Bleak Midwinter Film Festival, founded by Inglewood residents Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis. Additionally, the neighbourhood is home to the Calgary International Fringe Festival, the International Festival of Animated Objects and numerous stage performances, live music acts and art exhibitions throughout the year.\n\nSince Inglewood is in an environmentally sensitive area at the confluence of the Elbow and the Bow rivers, it is also home to several nature preserves. These include the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary, the Bow Habitat Station, Inglewood Wildlands Park, and the Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery. Another attraction of Inglewood, is the direct access via 9th ave to downtown Calgary, Deerfoot Trail and International Avenue (17 Ave SE).\n\nInglewood is also home to the Inglewood Aquatic Centre. This facility was built and opened in 1963 originally as an outdoor pool. Several years later it was enclosed so that it would be usable year-round. The land for the site of this swimming pool was donated to the City of Calgary by the Calgary Brewing and Malting Company Limited.\n\nThe Inglewood Aquatic Centre has a number of features and amenities.\n"}

Several varieties are available, including homestyle, miniature, blueberry, strawberry, vanilla bliss, brown sugar cinnamon, apple cinnamon, buttermilk, chocolate chip, and Thick And Fluffy.\n\nOther than waffles, Eggo also produces a selection of pancakes, French toast, and egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches, of which varieties include ham or sausage.\n\nBy mid-June 2009, Eggo had a 69% share of the frozen waffle market in the United States.\n\nEggo waffles were invented in San Jose, California, by Frank Dorsa, who developed a process by which waffles could be cooked, frozen, and packaged for consumers. In 1953, Dorsa, along with younger brothers Anthony and Sam, introduced Eggo frozen waffles to supermarkets throughout the United States. Frozen waffles do not require a waffle iron to prepare.\n\nBecause of the egg flavor, customers called them \"Eggos\". Eventually the name became synonymous with the product and, in 1955, the Dorsa brothers officially changed the name to \"Eggo\".\n\nAlong with frozen waffles, the Dorsa brothers also produced Eggo potato chips (and Golden Bear potato chips) and Eggo syrup. All of the products were produced at a sprawling plant and factory on Eggo Way in San Jose, CA, near the intersection of US 101 and East Julian Street. The Dorsas were very involved in local community activities and donated extensively to school and community projects. For Halloween, instead of candy, Tony Dorsa would give out bags of Eggo potato chips to trick-or-treaters.\n\nIn 1968, as a means of diversification, the Kellogg Company purchased Eggo. Their advertising slogan—\"L'eggo my Eggo\"—developed by Leo Burnett in 1972 is well known through their television commercials.\n\nKellogg's produced an Eggo brand breakfast cereal that was shaped to have the likeness of waffles. Flavors include maple syrup and cinnamon toast.\n\nIn 2016, the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\" featured Eggo waffles as a key story theme bringing the brand to global attention beyond the countries where the brand is sold. In the show, they are the favorite food of the character Eleven.\n\nIn fall 2009, there was a shortage of some Eggo products due to several problems. Among these were a listeria contamination which caused the Atlanta plant to be shut down for cleaning, severe flooding in the Atlanta area, and equipment repairs at the Kellogg plant in Rossville, Tennessee.\n\n"}

He was one of the first native Italian composers to write sacred music in the Franco-Flemish polyphonic style, combining it with the indigenous harmonic idioms of the Italian peninsula.\n\nHe was born in Florence. In 1505, around the time of his 13th birthday, he joined the choir of the church Ss. Annunziata in Florence, where his teacher was the distinguished composer to the Medici family, Bartolomeo degli Organi. Layolle eventually married his teacher's younger sister-in-law, Maddalena Arrighi. In 1518 he left Florence, settling in Lyon in 1521. While in Florence he also served as a music teacher to sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, who referred to him as a superb organist, musician, and composer.\n\nLayolle remained in Lyon for the rest of his life but retained a number of friends in Florence, including several men who conspired to overthrow the Medici in 1521. After the failure of the plot and the uncovering by the Medici of the perpetrators, the conspirators fled Florence, finding refuge in Lyon with Layolle, who was able to shelter them without fear of prosecution. In the subsequent trial they were all condemned \"in absentia\", but Layolle escaped censure; the reason for this is not known, but he never did return to Florence.\n\nHis duties in Lyon included playing the organ at the cathedral of Notre Dame de Confort; in addition, he composed and edited music for some of the printing organizations there. One of his close associates was Jacques Moderne, the second-best-known printer in France after Pierre Attaignant. Much of Layolle's music was published by Moderne, but much of it has since been lost.\n\nThe 1540 date of Layolle's death is probable, but no death or burial records remain. A lament on his death was published in 1540, and Layolle's last compositions were also published in that year.\n\nWhile much of Layolle's music is lost, that which remains is generally progressive in style, melodic, and finely crafted. Most of his sacred music was published by Moderne, however, no copies remain of 61 motets and at least three masses.\n\nHe was one of the first composers to blend the Franco-Flemish and Italian styles. Prior to the early 16th century, most polyphonic sacred music was written by northerners, and Italians focused mainly on the lighter secular forms, and some uniquely Italian forms such as the laude spirituale; however in the early 16th century native Italian composers such as Layolle, and later Costanzo Festa, began to blend the northern polyphonic style with the Italian harmonic and tonal idioms, a blending which eventually resulted in the musical style of Palestrina and Lassus.\n\nTwo books of madrigals have survived, although he called them \"canzoni\". Some are in Italian and others in French, and more closely related to the contemporary chanson than the Italianate madrigal. At least one of the madrigals he wrote, \"Lasciar il velo\", became hugely popular in Europe and appears in many geographically scattered sources, both as a vocal piece and in instrumental transcription.\n\n"}

Formed in 1851 by East India Company, its roots can be traced to 1836 when the \"Coal Committee\", followed by more such committees, was formed to study and explore availability of coals in the eastern parts of India. David Hiram Williams, one of the first surveyors for the British Geological Survey, was appointed 'Surveyor of coal districts and superintendent of coal works, Bengal' on 3 December 1845 and arrived in India the following February. The phrase \"Geological Survey of India\" was first used on his Dec 1847 map of the Damoodah and Adji Great Coal Field, together with Horizontal and Vertical sections of the map. On 4 February 1848, he was appointed the \"Geological Surveyor of the Geological Survey of India\", but he fell off his elephant and, soon after, died with his assistant, F. B. Jones, of 'jungle fever' on 15 November 1848, after which John McClelland took over as the \"Officiating Surveyor\" until his retirement on 5 March 1851.\n\nUntil 1852, Geological Survey primarily remained focused on exploration for coal, mainly for powering steam transport, oil reserves, and ore deposits, when Sir Thomas Oldham, father of Richard Dixon Oldham, broadened the ambit of the scope of functioning of the Geological Survey of India by advancing the argument with the government that it was not possible to find coal without first mapping the geology of India. Thus, the Geological Survey commenced to map the rock types, geological structures and relative ages of different rock types . The age of rock strata was estimated from the presence of index fossils, which consumed much of the geologists' efforts in finding these index fossils, as the method of Radiometric dating for estimating the age of rock strata was not developed at that time. In 1869 Frederick Richard Mallet was first to visit Ramgarh crater. Later studies include by those of Arthur Lennox Coulson \n\nIn 19th century GSI undertook several surveys including Great Trigonometrical Survey, 1869 Kailash-Mansarovar expedition, 1871-1872 Shigache–Lhasa expedition, 1873-1874 Yarkand–Kashgar expedition, second expedition of this area by Sir Thomas Douglas Forsyth, 1878-1882 Darjeeling–Lhasa–Mongolia expedition, etc. The native surveyors were called pandit, some notable ones include cousins Nain Singh Rawat and Krishna Singh Rawat.\n\nIn 19th and early 20th century GSI made important contributions to Seismology by its studies and detailed reports on numerous Indian earthquakes. Richard Dixon Oldham, like his father also worked for GSI, first correctly identified p- and s-waves, and hypothesised and calculated the diameter of the Earth's core.\n\nOn 8 April 2017 GSI began pilot project, with the first ever aerial survey of mineral stocks by GSI, to map the mineral stocks up to a depth of 20 km using specially-equipped aircraft.\n\nThe GSI was restructured into 5 Missions, respectively relating to \"Baseline Surveys\";\"Mineral resource Assessments\";\"Geoinformatics\";\"Multi-disciplinary Geosciences\"; and \"Training and Capacity Building\", on the basis of the Report of a High-level Committee chaired by Mr S.Vijay Kumar Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Mines of the Government of India.\n\nSome of the geological parks include Tiruvakkarai National Fossil Wood Park national geo-heritage site with wood fossils scattered over 247 acres nine separate enclaves, Sathanur National Fossil Wood Park national geo-heritage site with an 18-meter 120 million years old fossilised tree trunk from the Cretaceous period, Nehru Zoological Park at Hyderabad with life size figures of T-Rex and other dinosaurs, and Saketi Fossil Park near Chandigarh with a fossil museum and life size fiberglass models of six pre-historic animals.\n\n"}

It was originally broadcast on April 26, 2000. The episode is based on the Dionne quintuplets and the then-recent Elián González affair, the case of a Cuban-born child who had been taken by federal authorities four days before the episode aired.\n\nAfter watching \"Cirque Du Cheville\" (a \"Cirque du Soleil\" parody) and liking the performance of quintuplets from the show in particular, the boys hope to make a new performance artist style circus. The boys, however, think Kenny needs to learn how to sing first. Meanwhile, the Romanian contorting quintuplets from the show, along with their grandmother, try to escape from the Romanian government hoping to bring them back. The five end up at the Marsh house, asking for shelter. Meanwhile, Kenny learns to sing through opera tapes (namely \"Con te partirò\") . At the Marsh house, Grandpa Marsh and the quints' grandmother (using her own contortion skills) have sex.\n\nThe next morning, a shocked Randy finds the grandmother dead (after a night with Grandpa Marsh). After telling the quints, and with some persuasion from Cartman, Stan, and Kyle (who hope to use the quints for their circus, in which their performance is to do some contortions wearing only underpants with the Quints doing their performance), Stan's parents let the quints stay with them. The boys then decide to show the quints how great America is, taking them to, among other things, a sheep-shearing contest and a shopping mall, hoping they'll stay and do their circus. Meanwhile, the Romanian government seek Janet Reno to help get the quints back. Also, seeking to get to Romania for singing training, Kenny sings the aria \"La donna è mobile\" from Verdi's Rigoletto for money in order to acquire transport for him and his mother. In Romania, Kenny proves to be a sensational singer, and, after his mother realizes that the small amount of money that she brought from the US provides them with two months of food and housing due to the massive cost of living difference between Romania and the United States, the two decide to stay. Back in the US, the Marsh house is surrounded by protesters, hoping to let the quints stay. Reno dresses as the Easter Bunny and armed with a gun and an Easter Egg-shaped tear gas canister, captures the quints. Stan, Kyle and Cartman, who don't want to lose their circus, enlist the help of the protesters outside to get the quints back.\n\nA large amount of violence starts between the protesters and government soldiers, which is stopped by the quints after they tell off all the groups on their shortcomings: their father for acting like he missed them when he in fact walked out on them five years ago, the Romanian Leaders for caring nothing about them and only wanted to make America look stupid, the protesters for having nothing better to do, and the boys (whom they consider the worst of all) for their ignorance about Romanian culture, arrogant assumptions about America's superiority, and only wanting to use the girls to perform in their circus. They then get in Oprah Winfrey's limousine for an upcoming press tour.\nMeanwhile, the exact opposite of the quints' situation is occurring with Kenny in Romania. With Romanians protesting outside his house to let him stay, American soldiers invade the house and Kenny is inadvertently killed by the U.S. government, who had hoped to bring him back alive.\n\nAs explained in the FAQ section on the official website, \"When the year 2000 was coming up, everyone and their brother had '2000' in the titles of their products and TV shows. America was obsessed with 2000, so Trey Parker put '2000' in the titles to make fun of the ubiquity of the phrase.\" Originally, the plot involved returning the quintuplets and Kenny to their respective countries, but shortly after Elian Gonzalez was taken from his Miami relatives' home the Saturday before Easter 2000, April 22, Parker and Stone quickly changed the plot so that it would look exactly like the Miami raid.\n\n"}
{"id": "2153929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153929", "title": "Interlock protocol", "text": "Interlock protocol\n\nThe interlock protocol, as described by Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir, was designed to frustrate eavesdropper attack against two parties that use an anonymous key exchange protocol to secure their conversation. A further paper proposed using it as an authentication protocol, which was subsequently broken.\n\nMost cryptographic protocols rely on the prior establishment of secret or public keys or passwords. However, the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol introduced the concept of two parties establishing a secure channel (that is, with at least some desirable security properties) without any such prior agreement. Unauthenticated Diffie–Hellman, as an anonymous key agreement protocol, has long been known to be subject to man in the middle attack. However, the dream of a \"zipless\" mutually authenticated secure channel remained.\n\nThe Interlock Protocol was described as a method to expose a middle-man who might try to compromise two parties that use anonymous key agreement to secure their conversation.\n\nThe Interlock protocol works roughly as follows: \n\n\nThe strength of the protocol lies in the fact that half of an encrypted message cannot be decrypted. Thus, if Mallory begins her attack and intercepts Bob and Alice's keys, Mallory will be unable to decrypt Alice's half-message (encrypted using her key) and re-encrypt it using Bob's key. She must wait until both halves of the message have been received to read it, and can only succeed in duping one of the parties if she composes a completely new message.\n\nDavies and Price proposed the use of the Interlock Protocol for authentication in a book titled Security for Computer Networks. But an attack on this was described by Steven M. Bellovin & Michael Merritt. A subsequent refinement was proposed by Ellison.\n\nThe Bellovin/Merritt attack entails composing a fake message to send to the first party. Passwords may be sent using the Interlock Protocol between A and B as follows:\n\nwhere Ea,b(M) is message M encrypted with the key derived from the Diffie–Hellman exchange between A and B, <1>/<2> denote first and second halves, and Pa/Pb are the passwords of A and B.\n\nAn attacker, Z, could send half of a bogus message—P?--to elicit Pa from A:\n\nAt this point, Z has compromised both Pa and Pb. The attack can be defeated by verifying the passwords in parts, so that when Ea,z(P?)<1> is sent, it is known to be invalid and Ea,z(Pa)<2> is never sent (suggested by Davies). However, this does not work when the passwords are hashed, since half of a hash is useless, according to Bellovin. There are also several other methods proposed in, including using a shared secret in addition to the password. The forced-latency enhancement can also prevent certain attacks.\n\nA modified Interlock Protocol can require B (the server) to delay all responses for a known duration:\n\nWhere \"data\" is the encrypted data that immediately follows the Interlock Protocol exchange (it could be anything), encoded using an all-or-nothing transform to prevent in-transit modification of the message. Ma<1> could contain an encrypted request and a copy of Ka. Ma<2> could contain the decryption key for Ma<1>. Mb<1> could contain an encrypted copy of Kb, and Mb<2> could contain the decryption key for Mb<1> and the response, such as OK, or NOT FOUND, and the hash digest of the data.\n\nMITM can be attempted using the attack described in the Bellovin paper (Z being the man-in-the-middle):\n\nIn this case, A receives the data approximately after 3*T, since Z has to perform the interlocking exchange with B. Hence, the attempted MITM attack can be detected and the session aborted.\n\nOf course, Z could choose to not perform the Interlock Protocol with B (opting to instead send his own Mb) but then the session would be between A and Z, not A, Z, and B: Z wouldn't be in the middle. For this reason, the interlock protocol cannot be effectively used to provide authentication, although it can ensure that no third party can modify the messages in transit without detection.\n\n\n"}

The two stations share studios on South Regal Street in Spokane; KREM's transmitter is on Krell Hill southeast of Spokane.\n\nOn cable and satellite, the station can be seen in high definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 102 in the Spokane area, Charter Spectrum channel 1209 in the Coeur d'Alene area and the Palouse, and channel 2 (in both standard and high definition) on Dish Network and DirecTV.\n\nThe station is also carried on cable systems in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, both of which are double the size of KREM's American coverage area. One result of this is that stations in Calgary and Edmonton air American shows on Pacific Time, even though Calgary and Edmonton are both on Mountain Time. It is one of five local Spokane area television stations seen in Canada on the Shaw Direct satellite service. It can also been seen on local cable systems in eastern British Columbia.\n\nWhile KREM is the primary CBS affiliate for the Spokane market, Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned KLEW-TV (channel 3), based in Lewiston, Idaho, also is a CBS affiliate. However, it focuses on the southern portion of the market. Both KREM and KLEW are available on Dish Network and DirecTV throughout the Spokane market.\n\nKREM-TV signed on October 31, 1954 with an \"inaugural program\" at 6:30 p.m., followed by the 1933 movie \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\". It initially had a dual affiliation with ABC and the DuMont Network, the latter shared with cross-town competitor KXLY-TV because of its then-CBS affiliation at the time. After DuMont dissolved, KREM continued as an ABC affiliate. In the late 1950s, the station was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nKREM-TV was affiliated with ABC until August 8, 1976, when it swapped affiliations with KXLY-TV, whom CBS immediately dropped for constantly pre-empting or delaying its network shows. KREM thus became a full member of the CBS network. Initially, CBS had approached KHQ-TV, while KREM was considered for a possible NBC affiliation because of the King Broadcasting Company's sister stations being NBC affiliates, but KREM decided to sign with CBS instead. It was the only non-NBC affiliated station in the King Broadcasting portfolio.\n\nKREM-TV was originally owned by Cole Wylie alongside KREM radio (AM 970, now KTTO; and FM 92.9, now KZZU-FM). The King Broadcasting Company, run by Seattle businesswoman Dorothy Bullitt, bought the KREM stations from Wylie in 1957; the radio stations were sold off in 1984. (Coincidentally, the former KREM-FM is now a sister station to KXLY-TV.) However, channel 2 retained the -TV suffix in its callsign until 2009.\n\nKing Broadcasting was sold in 1992 to the Providence Journal Company, which merged with Belo Corporation five years later. On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo. The sale was completed on December 23.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KREM and KSKN were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.\n\nKREM and KSKN are a part of a cluster of television stations in the Northwestern United States owned by Tegna, which includes KING-TV and its sister station KONG in Seattle; KGW in Portland, Oregon; and KTVB in Boise. All four stations had provided material to co-owned Northwest Cable News, a regional 24-hour cable news service based in Seattle that served much of the region. KREM was the only non-NBC affiliate to be a primary contributor to NWCN, with the exception of KSKN and Seattle independent station KONG. The channel shut down on January 6, 2017.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKREM discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 20. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.\n\nKREM currently features CBS programming, as well as local news, public affairs and syndicated entertainment programming including \"The 700 Club\", \"Dr. Phil\", \"Friends\", and \"2 Broke Girls\", the latter of which airs first run episodes on CBS.\n\nKREM airs 28½ hours of newscasts with a two-hour morning broadcast, a noon telecast, and evening telecast at 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, and 11:00 p.m., along with weekend telecasts every Saturday and Sunday at 5:00, 6:00, and 11:00 p.m. KREM is still the only station in Spokane to hold a monopoly on midday newscasts for the Spokane area as of 2019.\n\nIn 1997, KREM, with its reporter Tom Grant, won an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award \"for Investigative Reporting on the Wenatchee Child Sex Ring.\" \n\nIn April 2010, KREM and KSKN began broadcasting its local newscasts in enhanced definition widescreen, and KREM became the third station in Spokane to switch in either HD or widescreen.\n\nFrom September 15, 2014 to January 2, 2015, KREM was the only station to air their newscasts from 7:00-9:00 a.m. on its sister station KSKN.

She was the founding member of the pro-business Liberal Party and the vice-chairwoman from 1998 to 2008. She was appointed to the Executive Council for the second time in 2003. In 2004, she won a directly elected seat in New Territories West but lost in her re-election in 2008. She continued to serve as party chairwoman from 2011 to 2012 and chairwoman from 2012 to 2014.\n\nSelina was born Liang Shuk-yee on 25 January 1945 in Hong Kong. She was educated at St. Paul's Co-educational College and earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of Hong Kong in 1965. She later obtained a postgraduate diploma from the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama and Licentiateship in Drama (Teacher and Performer) of the Royal Academy of Music in the United Kingdom.\n\nLiang started her career in Hong Kong's television broadcasting industry as the first weather girl in Hong Kong at the first wireless TV station Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) in 1967. She was an assistant producer at TVB in Broadcast Drive for the English and Chinese channels under general manager Colin Bednall before being promoted to Assistant General Manager to run the entire programming section.\n\nThinking her career in TVB had reached the glass ceiling, Chow left TVB in 1977 and joined Commercial Television (CTV) as general manager in an attempt to resurrect the ailing station, along with around 200 former TVB personnel including Tsui Hark, Patrick Tam and Ringo Lam in a bidding war between CTV and TVB. However, despite spending HK$50 million on production in just three years, CTV was unable to survive in the highly competitive television broadcasting industry and ceased transmissions in 1978. After she left CTV, Chow codirected her only feature film, \"No Big Deal\" in 1979, a teen comedy, with Po-Chih Leong.\n\nIn August 1988, Lai Sun Group founder Lim Por-yen took over Asia Television (ATV) and hired Chow as the station's chief executive. Chow proceeded in the same month to unveil a $233 million six-year investment plan to improve ATV's competitive edge against TVB. Chow's first year in office saw ATV's annual budget rocket to an estimated $300–350 million, just $100–150 million less than TVB. It also poached many talents from TVB, including comedy stars Lydia Shum and Eric Tsang, as well as producers, technical staff and administrators. The growing deficit sapped Chow's power as chief executive and in March 1991 she was formally dismissed and replaced by Lam Por-yen himself.\n\nChow first stepped into politics when she was appointed to the Urban Council in 1980. She was subsequently appointed to the Legislative Council in 1981 by Governor Murray MacLehose. She also held numerous public offices at the time, including the membership of the Law Reform Commission, the Housing Authority and the Education Commission, a well as the chairmanship of the Consumer Council.\n\nIn 1991, she was appointed to the Executive Council, the top advisory board in the government, by Governor David Wilson. She resigned the following year after the arrival of the last Governor Chris Patten who wanted to reshuffle the council. Chow was also a member of the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC) headed by Senior Member of the Legislative Council Allen Lee consisting of the appointed members who aimed to counter the rise of the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) in the legislature after their landslide victory in the first ever direct election in 1991.\n\nThe CRC soon transformed into the Liberal Party to actively lobby against Chris Patten's constitutional reform proposal, which they thought would damaged the smooth transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong due to Beijing's strong opposition. In the 1995 Legislative Council election, Chow contested in the Wholesale and Retail functional constituency and won the seat against Wong Kwok-hing of the Beijing-loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). She was later elected to the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) after the dismantling of the \"through train\" of the last colonial Legislative Council.\n\nIn the first SAR Legislative Council election in 1998, Allen Lee resigned as Liberal Party chairman lost in the direct election. James Tien succeeded as chairman and Chow became party vice-chairwoman. After 1997, the Liberal Party became the partner in Tung Chee-hwa's \"governing coalition\" which saw Chow being appointed to the Hong Kong Tourist Association before it was transformed into the Hong Kong Tourism Board in 2001.\n\nShe has also been a board member of the Hong Kong Airport Authority, honorary adviser to Against Child Abuse, and director of the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Society. As the most senior member in the Legislative Council, she was also the chairwoman of the House Committee of the Legislative Council from 2000 to 2003. From 2003 to 2008, she was also a member of the 10th National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).\n\nPublic opposition to the national security legislation of the Basic Law Article 23, and the historic 2003 July 1st protest against it, led to the resignation of Liberal Party chairman James Tien from the Executive Council on 6 July. Without Liberal support in the legislature, the government was short of sufficient votes to pass the bill, which it later shelved. In September 2003, Chow was appointed to the Executive Council to fill Tien's vacancy.\n\nRiding on the popularity from the 2003 crisis, Chow and Tien left their trade-based functional constituencies and ran in geographical constituencies. Chow won a seat in New Territories West with more than 50,000 votes, more than 10 per cent of the vote share, and was elected with Tien.\n\nIn the 2008 Legislative Council election, she lost her re-election in the New Territories West by receiving only about 21,000 votes, ending her 27 years of service in the legislature. Chow blamed the loss of her seat on Heung Yee Kuk chairman and Liberal Party member Lau Wong-fat for canvassing for the DAB candidate Cheung Hok-ming during the elections. As a result, both Tien and Chow resigned from the party organ with Chow also resigned from the Executive Council.\n\nSelina Chow and James Tien returned to the party leadership after the intra-party split between James's brother Michael Tien and Tommy Cheung over the Minimum Wage Bill which resulted Michael's departure from the party. In January 2011, Chow succeeded Tommy Cheung as the vice-chairwoman for the second time. In the 2012 Chief Executive election, the Liberals initially supported their former member and Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang but withdrew their support after Henry Tang's illegal basement controversy. However, they refused to support another Beijing-supported candidate Leung Chun-ying. Selina Chow and party chairwoman Miriam Lau defended their null vote as \"the responsible decision\" as they could not with all conscience vote for either Tang or Leung; their internal poll of 1,900 people showed 30 percent would cast blank votes.\n\nAfter Miriam Lau was defeated in Hong Kong Island in the 2012 Legislative Council election and resigned as party chairwoman, Selina Chow was elected chairwoman, unopposed, on 15 December 2012. Under her chairmanship, the new office of party leader was created and assumed by James Tien. She held the chairmanship for two years until she was succeeded by Felix Chung and became the party honorary chairwoman.\n\nIn the 2017 Chief Executive election, she split with other party figures in the election to nominate former Financial Secretary John Tsang on the capacity as an Election Committee member for Wholesale and Retail with James Tien, Miriam Lau and Felix Chung against the former Chief Secretary for Administration, the Beijing-supported Carrie Lam.\n\nLiang is married to engineer Joseph Chow Ming-kuen, having proposed on the phone when he was in Britain in 1968. The couple have two daughters, Chee-may and Chee-kay.\n\n"}

{"id": "2153948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2153948", "title": "Piano Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)", "text": "Piano Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)\n\nSergei Prokofiev set to work on his Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 16, in 1912 and completed it in 1913. But that version of the concerto is lost; the score was destroyed in a fire following the Russian Revolution. Prokofiev reconstructed the work in 1923, two years after finishing his Third Concerto, and declared it to be “so completely rewritten that it might almost be considered [Concerto] No. 4”; indeed, its orchestration has features that clearly postdate the 1921 concerto. Performing as soloist, Prokofiev premiered this “No. 2” in Paris on 8 May 1924 with Serge Koussevitzky conducting. It is dedicated to the memory of Maximilian Schmidthof, a friend of Prokofiev's at the St. Petersburg Conservatory who had killed himself in 1913.\n\nThe work is scored for piano solo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, tambourine and strings. It consists of four movements lasting some 29 to 37 minutes.\n\n\nThe work is dedicated to the memory of Maximilian Schmidthof, a friend of Prokofiev's at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, who had committed suicide in April 1913 after having written a farewell letter to Prokofiev. Prokofiev premiered the work that same year, performing the solo piano part, on August 23 at Pavlovsk. Most of the audience reacted intensely. The concerto's wild temperament left a positive impression on some of the listeners, whereas others were opposed to the jarring and modernistic sound (\"To hell with this futurist music!\"/ \"What is he doing, making fun of us?\"/ \"The cats on the roof make better music!\").\n\nWhen the original orchestral score was destroyed in a fire following the Russian Revolution, Prokofiev reconstructed and considerably revised the concerto in 1923; in the process, he made the concerto, in his own words, \"less foursquare\" and \"slightly more complex in its contrapuntal fabric\". The finished result, Prokofiev felt, was \"so completely rewritten that it might almost be considered [Concerto] No. 4\". (The Third Concerto had premiered in 1921). He premiered this revised version of the concerto in Paris on May 8, 1924 with Serge Koussevitzky conducting.\n\nIt remains one of the most technically formidable piano concertos in the standard repertoire. Prokofiev biographer David Nice noted in 2011: \"A decade ago I’d have bet you there were only a dozen pianists in the world who could play Prokofiev’s Second Piano Concerto properly. Argerich wouldn’t touch it, Kissin delayed learning it, and even Prokofiev as virtuoso had got into a terrible mess trying to perform it with Ansermet and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the 1930s, when it had gone out of his fingers.\"\n\nThe first and last movements are each around twelve minutes long and constitute some of the most dramatic music in all of Prokofiev's piano concertos. They both contain long and developed cadenzas with the first movement's cadenza alone taking up almost the entire last half of the movement.\n\nThe first movement opens quietly with strings and clarinet playing a two-bar staccato theme which, Prokofiev biographer Daniel Jaffé suggests, \"sounds almost like a ground bass passacaglia theme, that musical symbol of implacable fate\". The piano takes over, constructing over a left hand accompaniment of breathing undulation a G minor \"narrante\" theme which, in the words of Soviet biographer Israel Nestyev, \"suggests a quiet, serious tale in the vein of a romantic legend\". This opening theme contains a second idea, a rising scalic theme; as Robert Layton observes, when it is later taken up by unison strings as \"a broad singing melody, one feels that the example of Rachmaninov has not gone altogether unheeded\".\n\nA brief \"forte\", backed by the orchestra, leads to a third, expansive, walking theme performed again by the solo pianist; Layton notes that this \"looks forward to its counterpart in the Third Piano Concerto: there is no mistaking its slightly flippant character\". The recapitulation section is in effect carried entirely by the soloist's notoriously taxing five-minute cadenza, one of the longer and more difficult cadenze in the classical piano repertoire, taking the listener all the way to the movement's climax. Noted in two staves, the piano plays a reprise of its own opening theme. A third staff, which requires the pianist to perform large jumps with both hands frequently, contains the motif from the earlier orchestral accompaniment.\n\nThe accumulated charge is eventually released in a premature climax (G minor), marked \"fff\" and \"colossale\", which consists of oscillating triplet semiquaver runs across the upper four octaves of the piano, kept in rhythm by a leaping left-hand crotchet accompaniment. Prokofiev himself describes this as one of the hardest places in the concerto.\n\n<score vorbis>\\version \"2.14.1\"\n\\new GrandStaff «\n»</score>\n\nThe last bars before the absolute climax are marked \"tumultuoso\" and reach supreme discord as C sharp minor collides with D minor.\n\nAs both hands move apart, to embrace the piano \"fff\" in D minor, an accent on every note, the orchestra announces its return, strings and timpani swelling furiously from \"p\" to \"ff\". The listener is exposed to the apocalyptic blare of several horns, trombones, trumpets and tuba, which, as Jaffé describes it, \"balefully [play] the opening 'fate' theme \"fortissimo\"\", while piano, flutes and strings still shriek in unison up and down the higher ranges. Two cymbal crashes end the cataclysm in G minor.\n\nA decrescendo brings the music back to an almost spooky \"piano\" in which the piano timidly puts forth the second \"narrante\" theme, echoes its last notes, repeats it \"pianissimo\", ever fading. Pizzicato strings point several more times to the opening theme, the significance of which has now been revealed.\n\nThe scherzo is of an exceptionally strict form considering the piano part. The right and left hand play a stubborn unison, almost 1500 semiquavers each, literally without a moment's pause: Robert Layton describes the soloist in this movement being like \"some virtuoso footballer who retains the initiative while the opposing team (the orchestra) all charge after him\". At around ten notes a second and with hardly any variations in speed, this movement lasts circa two-and-a-half minutes and is an unusual concentration challenge to the pianist. It displays the \"motor\" line of the five \"lines\" (characters) Prokofiev describes in his own music. (Other such pieces include Toccata in D minor and the last movement of Piano Sonata No. 7). One fleeting motif, to make a major appearance in the final movement, appears (fig. 39 in the score) in the cellos' part – \"a chromatically inflected triplet plus quaver, played twice before tailing off\".\n\nUnlike the other three movements, it is mainly in \"D minor\".\n\nInstead of a lyrical slow movement which might have been expected after a scherzo (cf Brahms's Second Piano Concerto), Prokofiev provides a fast-paced, menacing Intermezzo. Layton characterises this movement as \"in some ways the most highly characterized of all four movements, with its flashes of sardonic wit and forward-looking harmonies\".\n\nThe movement starts with a heavy-footed walking bass theme – directed to be played heavily (\"pesante\") and \"fortissimo\". The music has returned to G minor. Strings, bassoon, tuba, timpani and \"gran cassa\" (bass drum) march along with moody determination. Trombones sharply pronounce a \"D\", followed by tuba and oboe in a sudden diminuendo. For several bars, the orchestra issues ever waning threats, at the same time making inexorably for the tonic, at which point the piano enters and the music immediately gains force. The march of the introduction continues as the piano modulates into new harmonic territory. There is one moment of respite from this \"sarcastically grotesque procession\" with the single appearance of \"an introverted theme of numbed lyricism\". After a restatement of the earlier material, the music ventures into a new lyrical theme in D minor, marked \"pp\" and \"dolce, un poco scherzando\". The piano and flutes gracefully glide up and down the upper octaves. Then, the piano repeats the theme by itself, humorous and \"secco\", before being joined by the orchestra. The tension builds and the music ascends until it reaches a climax, when the opening theme returns with baleful trombones and crashing chords at the top of the piano. The woodwinds bring the intensity back down and the movement ends quietly with a final stroke of wit.\n\nFive octaves above the intermezzo's end note, a \"fortissimo\" tirade pounces out of the sky, written in four-four-time but played in seven-eight (\"one\"-two-three-four-\"one\"-two-three etc.). After six bars it settles down in the vicinity of middle C. Running up to an acid semitonal acciaccatura in both hands, the piano goes over into a sprint of octave-chords and single notes, jumping manically up and down the keyboard twice a bar. An audible theme is picked out, and during a \"piano\" and staccato repetition of the theme, the strings and flutes rush up, bringing the music to the briefest of halts. A moment later the piano goes back to \"forte\" and the sprint sets off anew. It is repeated three more times in total before the piano performs a stormy gallop of triads (\"tempestoso\"), the hands flying apart more or less symmetrically, while the strings throw in a frantic accompaniment of regular staccato eighths. The piano puts a momentary end to its own fury with a barely feasible manoeuvre, both hands jumping up three or four octaves simultaneously and \"fortissimo\" in the time of a semiquaver. But by then the sprint has transformed into a \"fearful pursuit with an obsessively repeated triplet motif [first heard fleetingly in the Scherzo movement] overshadowed by the baleful roars of tuba and trombones\". Only moments later, the orchestra has reached a halt and the piano, unaccompanied, plays soft but dissonant chords which, Jaffé suggests, are \"reminiscent of the bell-like chords which open the final piece in Schoenberg's Six Little Piano Pieces, Op. 19\" which were composed in homage to Mahler shortly after his death. (Jaffé points out that Prokofiev had introduced Schoenberg's music to Russia by playing the Op. 11 pieces, and suggests that Prokofiev may have known and been inspired by Schoenberg's Op. 19 to use a similar bell motif to commemorate Schmidthof.)\n\nThe piano stands aside for eight bars while the strings, still \"mf\", embark on a new episode. The soloist then plays a wistful theme in D minor similar in character to the first movement's piano opening theme, characterised by Jaffé as a \"lullaby\" while noting (as does Nestyev) its affinity to Mussorgsky. The bassoons take up the wandering piano-theme, while the piano itself goes over into a \"pp\" semiquaver accompaniment. The music eventually winds down, with \"a despondent-sounding version of the lullaby theme on bassoon abruptly cut off by a sharply articulated and very final sounding cadence from the orchestra\". But, as Jaffé notes, \"The pianist won't let things rest... but hammers out the 'pursuit' theme\", so initiating \"not so much a cadenza... but a post-cadential meditation on the 'bell' chords\". The orchestra joins in after some time, reintroducing the piano's \"lullaby\" theme, while the soloist's part still flows across the octaves. The key regularly changes from A minor to C minor and back again, the music becomes ever broader and harder to play. Rhythm and tune then fall into an abrupt \"piano\", no less threatening than the previous \"forte\". Trundling chromaticism has the music roll up to a \"fortissimo\", the orchestra still proclaiming the originally wistful piano-theme. This is the only place outside the \"andantino\" where the piano exceeds the older range of seven octaves, jumping two octaves up to \"B\" just one single time.\n\nA long diminuendo of gliding piano rushes brings the volume to a minimum \"pp\" (Prokofiev does not once use a \"ppp\" in the concerto's piano part). Then a ferocious blast (\"ff\") from the orchestra starts off the ferocious reprise.\n\nThe first recording on LP of the Second Concerto was made in November 1953 and was released on LP one year later on Remington Records R-199-182. The pianist was Jorge Bolet and the orchestra was the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conducted by Thor Martin Johnson. The recording was supervised by Laszlo Halasz and Don Gabor and was probably done in stereo. Jorge Bolet's performance set the standard by which practically all subsequent recordings were judged: Shura Cherkassky and Herbert Menges (HMV, mono); Nicole Henriot-Schweitzer and Charles Munch (RCA Stereo), Malcolm Frager with René Leibowitz (RCA Stereo). Tedd Joselson, then 19 years old, launched his recording career with this work in 1974 with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy (RCA). It is included in the complete recordings of Prokofiev's concertos by Vladimir Ashkenazy (rec. 1974-75), Michel Béroff (1974), Yefim Bronfman (1993), Horacio Gutiérrez (1990), Vladimir Krainev (1991), and Alexander Toradze (1995).\n\n\"The Prokofiev Page\", a site led by Sugi Sorensen, highly recommends the 1990 recording by Horacio Gutiérrez with Neeme Järvi and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Vladimir Ashkenazy's rendition with André Previn and the London Symphony Orchestra (Philips 452588) is also recommended. More recently, the Grammy Award-winning recording by Evgeny Kissin with Ashkenazy conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra (EMI Classics), has received high praise and recommendation. In 2009, Horacio Gutiérrez's 1990 recording with Neeme Järvi and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra was reissued (Prokofiev: The Concertos), receiving notable acclaim. The live 2013 recording by Yuja Wang with Gustavo Dudamel conducting the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra has received critical praise.\n\nThe concerto's scherzo provides the musical score for Swiss animator Georges Schwizgebel's animated short, \"Jeu\".\n\n\n"}

This implied a radical populism that would threaten the allegiance of the people of Liechtenstein to ruling Prince Franz Josef II.\n\nIn March 1939, the VDBL staged an amateurish coup attempt, first trying to provoke a German intervention by burning swastikas, followed by declaring an \"Anschluß\" with Germany. The leaders were almost immediately arrested and the hoped-for German invasion failed to materialise.\n\nThe inability of the party to participate in the 1939 elections (after a pact between the main parties to keep the election date a secret), combined with the drastic decrease in Nazi sympathies following the outbreak of World War II led to a temporary demise of the party. However, in June 1940 it was reconstituted under the leadership of Dr. Alfons Goop. During 1941 and 1942, the party was involved in vehement anti-Semitic agitation, urging a solution to the country's presumed \"Jewish Question\", accusing Jewish families in Liechtenstein of spying for the Allies. By early 1943, the VDBL had become an embarrassment to Germany: its recruitment for the Waffen-SS compromised Liechtenstein's neutrality, disquieting the Swiss. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March 1943 forced the VDBL to hold talks with the Patriotic Union (VU), in Friedrichshafen under auspices of the Waffen-SS, in order to reach a fusion of both parties, which shared an anti-Bolshevik and anti-clerical programme. Severely disappointed, Goop resigned as party leader. In the end the VU only consented to some \"cultural cooperation\". When Germany's war fortunes declined, in July 1943 \"Der Umbruch\" was forbidden by the authorities. In 1946, party leaders were prosecuted for the 1939 coup attempt. Goop was in 1947 condemned for high treason, to an imprisonment of thirty months.\n"}

The adult's elytra are green, gray or tan, with black markings, and the whole animal, including the male's horns, may reach in length. The grubs feed on decaying wood from various trees.\n\nAdults of both sexes are wide, and males are long, including a long horn (the \"pronotal horn\") which projects forwards from the thorax of the male; a second horn (the \"clypeal horn\") projects upwards from the head. \"Dynastes tityus\" is therefore \"among the longest and heaviest beetles in the United States\". The horns are used in battles between rival males competing for a mate; the size of the horn reflects the availability of food when the beetle was growing. Despite the size of the horns, \"Dynastes tityus\" is harmless to humans.\n\nThe elytra are green, gray, or tan, usually with black mottling. The pattern of spots is unique to each individual. Beetles that are found in the soil or in rotten wood often appear very dark, with the spots on the elytra obscured. This results from moisture which the shell has absorbed; when the elytra dry out, they return to their paler color. Occasionally, both elytra may be a uniform mahogany color, or one elytron may be pale with dark blotches, while the other is a plain mahogany color.\n\n\"Dynastes tityus\" was featured on a stamp issued by the United States Postal Service in October 1999.\n\n\"D. tityus\" lives in the eastern and southeastern United States, from New York state, Illinois and Indiana, south to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, with eastern Texas marking the western limit of its range.\n\nThree of the 6 species of \"Dynastes\" found in the New World occur in the United States or Mexico. While \"D. tityus\" is found in the eastern United States, \"Dynastes granti\" (the western Hercules beetle) occurs at higher elevations in Arizona and Utah, and \"Dynastes hyllus\" is found as far north as Tamaulipas, Mexico. \"D. tityus\" and \"D. granti\" are very similar, and it is possible to mate them and produce viable hybrids.\n\nMating can last up to 50 minutes in \"D. tityus\". Subsequent batches of eggs are oviposited in the same site until its resources are exhausted. The larvae are large C-shaped grubs with white bodies and chewing mouthparts, which feed on decaying wood and litter within rotten trees and produce distinctive rectangular fecal pellets about long. After 12–18 months, the larva pupate in late summer. Adults remain underground through the winter, initially remaining in their pupal cell. They emerge in the summer and live for 6-8 months. The adults' diet is not well known, but they have been observed lapping up the sap of ash trees.\n\nDifferent predators attack different life stages of \"Dynastes tityus\". The eggs are vulnerable to attack from a predatory mite. The grubs are eaten by mammals including skunks and raccoons, and soil-dwelling arthropods, including centipedes, ground beetles, spiders and the maggots of Mydas flies.\n\n\"Dynastes tityus\" is known by a number of common names, including \"eastern Hercules beetle\", \"elephant beetle\" and \"ox beetle\". It was first given a scientific name by Carl Linnaeus, in his 1763 work \"Centuria Insectorum\", where it was called \"Scarabaeus tityus\"; when Linnaeus' genus \"Scarabaeus\" was divided into smaller genera, \"S. tityus\" was renamed \"Dynastes tityus\".\n\n"}

In the Mexican–American War he participated in the captures of Veracruz, Tuxpan, and Tabasco. Fighting on the Union side in the Civil War, he took part in the relief of Fort Pickens, followed by many engagements on the Lower Mississippi, before being promoted captain of USS \"Brooklyn\" and assisting in the Union victory in the Battle of Mobile Bay.\n\nAlden was born in Portland, Maine, and was a direct descendant of John Alden, a Mayflower pilgrim. He was appointed midshipman on April 1, 1828 and spent the initial years of his naval career ashore at the Naval Station in Boston, Massachusetts before he served in the Mediterranean Squadron on board the sloop of war USS \"John Adams\". Promoted to passed midshipman on June 14, 1834, Alden then served at the Boston Navy Yard until he was assigned to the United States Exploring Expedition under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes.\n\nDuring the course of his first voyage (1838–1842), the officers and men of the expedition were transferred freely from one vessel to another; Alden, promoted to lieutenant on February 25, 1841, concluded the cruise as executive officer of the sloop USS \"Porpoise\". He saw action at Malolo, in the Fiji Islands, on July 26, 1840, in the punitive expedition against the tribe which had murdered Lieutenant Joseph Underwood and Midshipman Wilkes Henry two days before. Henry was a nephew of the expedition's leader.\n\nAfter another tour of duty at the naval station at Boston, Alden was assigned to USS \"Constitution\", and circumnavigated the globe in the frigate during her cruise under Captain John (\"Mad Jack\") Percival. While serving therein, he commanded a boat expedition that cut out several war junks from under the guns of a fort at Zuron Bay, Cochin China. Later serving in the Home Squadron during the Mexican–American War (1846), Alden, an adept surveyor, participated in the captures of Veracruz, Tuxpan, and Tabasco.\n\nFollowing the war with Mexico, Alden served as inspector of provisions and clothing at Boston until detached from this duty on May 18, 1849 to go to Washington, D.C., and report to the Secretary of the Treasury for duty with the United States Coast Survey. From the summer of 1849 to the late winter of 1851, he commanded, in succession, the Coast Survey steamers \"John Y. Mason\" and \"Walker\" in survey duty off the eastern seaboard. Assigned to duty on the Pacific coast thereafter, Alden traveled to San Francisco where he replaced William Pope McArthur as commander of the Coast Survey Schooner \"Ewing\". He arrived in May 1851 and surveyed from San Francisco to San Diego, reporting on the expedition from San Francisco on February 17, 1852.\n\nIn 1852, he assumed command of the Coast Survey steamer \"Active\", purchased to replace the wrecked \"Jefferson\" (the \"Ewing\" was temporarily abandoned,) and carried out survey work off the United States West Coast into 1860. During this time, on September 1, 1855, he was promoted to commander. Indian disturbances in Washington Territory in January 1856 highlighted Alden's tour of duty in command of \"Active\", and his ship, joining the sloop-of-war USS \"Decatur\" and the steamer USS \"Massachusetts\", proved \"of great service\" during those troubled times. \"Active\" operated in the headwaters of Puget Sound, where her presence reassured the settlers. In the summer of 1859, during tensions incident to an American's killing a Britisher's pig on San Juan Island, \"Active\"s timely arrival at that isle apparently helped to quiet a potentially dangerous situation in what became later known as the \"Pig War.\"\n\nThe outbreak of the American Civil War in the spring of 1861 found Alden in command of the steamer USS \"South Carolina\", in which he participated in the relief of Fort Pickens. Next given the steam sloop USS \"Richmond\", Alden commanded her in the passage of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, and in the engagements with Confederate batteries at Chalmette, Louisiana, twice passing the southern guns at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and in the battle at Port Hudson, Louisiana.\n\nPromoted to captain on January 2, 1863, Alden next assumed command of the steam sloop USS \"Brooklyn\", and led that ship in the action with Fort Gaines and Fort Morgan and with the Confederate gunboats in the Battle of Mobile Bay. While \"Brooklyn\" was being sent north for repairs, she was attached to the naval forces gathering off Fort Fisher, North Carolina, and took part in both assaults on that Confederate bastion.\n\nPromoted to commodore on July 25, 1866, Alden, over the next two years, commanded, in succession, the steam sloop USS \"Susquehanna\" and the steam frigate USS \"Minnesota\" before he was made commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard. Appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation in April 1869 and promoted to rear admiral on June 19, 1871, Alden returned to sea in 1871 with orders to command the naval force on the European Station.\n\nDeparting New York in his flagship, USS \"Wabash\", on November 17, 1871, Alden relieved Rear Admiral Charles S. Boggs at Villefranche, France, on January 1, 1872. Although placed on the retired list on March 31, 1872, Alden remained on active duty commanding the European Fleet until relieved by Rear Admiral A. Ludlow Case at Villefranche on June 2, 1873. His last tour of duty afloat completed, he sailed home in his former command, \"Brooklyn\".\n\nAlden died at San Francisco on February 6, 1877, but was buried in his native Portland on February 24, 1877.\n\nThe U.S. Navy destroyer USS \"Alden\" was named for him.\n"}

Since 2007 the two breweries joined together as one business and by 2009 both brands were then produced together in Dover, Delaware. The brewery, as a whole, brews over 20 different styles of beer, both year-round and seasonal products. The brewery also makes specialty soda under the Dominion name, including Root Beer, Orange Cream, Black Cherry, and Ginger Ale.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2006, Old Dominion hosted an annual beer festival that showcased small brewers from around the region, as well as some breweries from around the US and Europe. The festival featured more than 50 breweries and live music. The three-day event was held each year on the last full weekend of June; management and organization of the festival was given over to Vintage 50, which now hosts the event twice a year, in June and October.\n\nOld Dominion has been fertile ground for producing high quality brewers, such as: John Mallet at Bell's Brewery, Ron Barchet at Victory Brewing Company, Matthew Hagerman at Lost Rhino Brewing Company, Favio Garcia at Lost Rhino Brewing and Dynasty Brewing, and Kenny Allen at True Respite Brewing Company.\n\nBailey put Old Dominion up for sale in the mid-2000s. No serious offers to purchase the company were made until 2007, when Fordham Brewing of Annapolis, Maryland offered to purchase the company, financed in part by Anheuser-Busch (AB) for a minority stake in the two breweries, to form Coastal Brewing Company. The majority of Coastal is owned by Fordham Brewing Company, owned by Bill Muhlhauser (owner of both Fordham and the Ram's Head Taverns of Maryland) and other partners. Anheuser-Busch's purchase stake gave them no control of either of the two breweries, nor any input or influence on brewery recipes, nor oversight of any day-to-day management. The brewery also owns its own distribution rights.\n\nOld Dominion also operated a brewpub at the Ashburn brewery, which was closed in August 2008. In the year prior to the acquisition by Anheuser Busch/Fordham, the Brewpub had posted record sales of $2.1 million and had seen positive growth for more than a decade. Due to declining quality and a disillusioned customer base that largely abandoned their beloved once-local brewery, AB/Fordham was forced to cease operations of the Brewpub after 13 years of operation and profitability.\n\nImmediately after the sale, the brewers at Old Dominion worked with the brewers at Fordham for several months to ensure a consistent recipe transition. After the breweries combined operations, Coastal Brewing increased its focus on Old Dominion's core/popular brands. Their most popular series is their newest Pinup Series. Candi, their Belgian Tripel won Gold in the 2014 World Beer Cup. Also noted for the Double D Double IPA. Contrary to some accounts, AB-InBev had no input or influence on these decisions; they were solely based on economic concerns over the contract brands failing to meet sales expectations.\n\nIn May 2009 all brewing operations, combined with those of Fordham Brewing, were moved to a new facility in Dover, Delaware. The current core brands of the brewery continue to sell briskly in both the on-site and packaging ends, and can be found as the \"house\" brews at many locations throughout the DC Metro area, including the Great American Restaurant chain (except for the Sweetwater Tavern in Centreville, Virginia), Capital One Arena, and Nationals Park. Old Dominion continues to host various brew sampling and cask events throughout the DC-MD-VA-DE-NJ-PA metropolitan area, maintaining their status as a Mid-Atlantic regional brewer, and their Oak Barrel Stout and Pinup Series brands remain popular sellers in the packaging end of the line, available at several retail and grocery chains,bars and retailers in their regions. \nAs of January 2011, Jim Lutz (former VP of sales and marketing at Flying Dog Brewery of Frederick, MD), took over as the new President and CEO of Coastal Brewing.\n\n\n\nSeasonal beers include:\n\n"}

The station is the flagship and namesake of the KHQ Television Group, a subsidiary of the locally based Cowles Company, which also owns \"The Spokesman-Review\" newspaper. KHQ-TV's studios are located on West Sprague Avenue in downtown Spokane, and its transmitter is located on Krell Hill southeast of the city. The station also operates a 24-hour sports and weather channel called SWX Right Now on digital subchannel 6.2.\n\nOn cable and satellite, KHQ-TV is available in high definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 106 in the Spokane area, Charter Spectrum channel 1203 in the Coeur d'Alene area and the Palouse, and channel 6 (in both standard and high definition) on Dish Network and DirecTV.\n\nThe station is also carried on cable systems in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, both of which are double the size of KHQ's American coverage area. One result of this is that stations in Calgary and Edmonton air American shows on Pacific Time, even though Calgary and Edmonton are both on Mountain Time. It is one of five local Spokane area television stations seen in Canada on the Shaw Direct satellite service. It can also been seen on local cable systems in eastern British Columbia.\n\nKHQ-TV also handles master control and some internal operations for sister stations and fellow NBC affiliates KNDO and KNDU in the Yakima–Tri-Cities market.\n\nWhile KHQ and KXLY were both granted authorization by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build television stations on July 12, 1952, KHQ was first to sign on the air, going live on Saturday, December 20, 1952 at 6 p.m. with the film \"Texas Trouble Shooters\". The first NBC program KHQ broadcast was an episode of \"Your Hit Parade\", which aired that evening at 7:30. In addition to being the oldest television station east of the Cascades, KHQ is also the second-oldest station in Washington state. It was co-owned by Cowles Publishing along with KHQ radio (AM 590, now KQNT; and FM 98.1, now KISC). The radio stations were both sold off in 1985.\n\nIt was originally a dual NBC/ABC affiliate. KREM-TV took the ABC affiliation when it signed on air in 1954, but KHQ kept the NBC affiliation, which it retains to this day. It is the only major station in Spokane, and one of a few in the country, that has retained the same primary affiliation, owner and call letters throughout its history.\n\nAfter being in its original studio for over forty years, KHQ moved its headquarters to 1201 W. Sprague Avenue in downtown Spokane in 2001, where it still is today. The reason for the move was to create an all-digital facility, so modern media technology could work well with the news station. In the process, KHQ became the first all-digital facility in Spokane.<ref name=\"http://www.khq.com/global/Story.asp?s=8333085\">KHQ Milestone: Armed Forces Torchlight Parade broadcast in HD</ref>\n\nTraditionally, KHQ has been known as \"Q6,\" but the station largely deemphasized this branding during the 2000s, near-exclusively referring to itself verbally with its call letters, even though it still used the \"Q6\" logo. On September 24, 2018, coinciding with the introduction of new newscast graphics, the \"Q6\" branding was restored full-time to the station's newscasts, which were rebranded \"Q6 Local News – Right Now.\"\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKHQ-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 15 due to adjacent channel interference with KSPS (now on channel 8). Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6.\n\nKHQ-TV's current syndicated programming offerings include \"Hot Bench\", \"TMZ\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Judge Judy\", \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\".\n\nKHQ-TV has been the local home of Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball games since 2001. KHQ-TV and Root Sports Northwest simulcast all games not covered by either the West Coast Conference's television contract with ESPN or that of an inter-conference opponent.\n\nIn 2006, with the popularity of high-definition newscasts increasing around the country, the race to HD began in the Spokane television market when competitor KXLY became the first Spokane station to produce a local segment of the news in HD. Each week, one news story was presented in high definition. Until 2008, KXLY was the only news station in Spokane to produce a segment of the news in HD.\n\nOn May 16, 2008, KHQ produced a live, on-the-air report in HD. It was officially announced on this date that KHQ was slated to become the first station in Spokane to broadcast its entire newscasts in HD, debuting on August 8, 2008 to coincide with the 2008 Summer Olympics on NBC. However, after months of marketing this milestone, KXLY shocked KHQ and the Spokane television market when it made a surprise announcement on August 1, just two days before the start of its broadcasts, that it would beat KHQ in becoming the first station in Spokane to produce HD newscasts. KXLY's HD newscasts started August 3, just a mere five days before KHQ's scheduled date. Despite marketing their newscasts as being in HD, KHQ did not yet present its newscasts in true high definition, but in standard definition widescreen. However, with the implementation of a new master control hub (which handles the operations of KHQ, along with sister stations KNDU and KNDO and its SWX channels) using fiberoptic links, and the purchase of new studio equipment and cameras, KHQ migrated to full HD newscasts in late 2012.\n\nIn 2008, KHQ and Northern Quest Resort & Casino started a partnership, and created SWX, a 24-hour sports and weather channel. SWX soft-launched in January 2009, and officially launched on August 30, 2009.\n\nUnlike most NBC affiliates, the station does not air a noon newscast.\n\n\nKHQ is rebroadcast on the following translator stations:\n"}
{"id": "2154041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154041", "title": "Laryngeal papillomatosis", "text": "Laryngeal papillomatosis\n\nLaryngeal papillomatosis, also known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis or glottal papillomatosis, is a rare medical condition in which benign tumors (papilloma) form along the aerodigestive tract. There are two variants based on the age of onset: juvenile and adult laryngeal papillomatosis. The tumors are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the throat. The tumors may lead to narrowing of the airway, which may cause vocal changes or airway obstruction. Laryngeal papillomatosis is initially diagnosed through indirect laryngoscopy upon observation of growths on the larynx and can be confirmed through a biopsy. Treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis aims to remove the papillomas and limit their recurrence. Due to the recurrent nature of the virus, repeated treatments usually are needed. Laryngeal papillomatosis is primarily treated surgically, though supplemental nonsurgical and/or medical treatments may be considered in some cases. The evolution of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly variable. Though total recovery may be observed, it is often persistent despite treatment. The number of new cases of laryngeal papillomatosis cases is at approximately 4.3 cases per 100,000 children and 1.8 cases per 100,000 adults annually.\n\nA common symptom of laryngeal papillomatosis is a perceptual change in voice quality. More specifically, hoarseness is observed. As a consequence of the narrowing of the laryngeal or tracheal parts of the airway, shortness of breath, chronic cough and stridor (i.e. noisy breathing which can sound like a whistle or a snore), can be present. As the disease progresses, occurrence of secondary symptoms such as dysphagia, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, failure to thrive, and recurrent upper respiratory infections can be diagnosed. The risk of laryngeal papillomatosis spreading to the lungs is higher in the juvenile-onset than the adult-onset. In children, symptoms are usually more severe and often mistaken for manifestations of other diseases such as asthma, croup or bronchitis. Therefore, diagnosis is usually delayed.\n\nLaryngeal papillomatosis is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, most frequently genotypes 6 and 11 although genotypes 16, 18, 31, and 33 have also been implicated. HPV-11 is associated with more aggressive forms of papillomatosis, which may involve more distal parts of the tracheobronchial tree. The mode of viral inoculation is hypothesized to vary according to age of disease onset. The presence of HPV in the respiratory tract does not necessarily result in the development of laryngeal papillomatosis. Other factors that could be involved include immunodeficiency or other similar infections. For example, laryngeal papillomatosis may become more aggressive due to the presence of certain viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus).\n\nThe disease is typically separated into two forms, juvenile and adult papillomatosis, based on whether it develops before or after 20 years of age. The juvenile form is generally transmitted through contact with a mother's infected vaginal canal during childbirth. Less is known about transmission in the adult form of this disease, though oral sex has been implicated as a potential mode of transmission. However, it is uncertain whether oral sex would directly transmit the virus or activate the dormant virus that was transmitted at childbirth.\n\nIn general, physicians are unsure why only certain people who have been exposed to the HPV types implicated in the disease develop laryngeal papillomatosis. In the case of the juvenile form of the disease, the likelihood of a child born of an infected mother developing laryngeal papillomatosis is low (between 1 in 231 to 1 in 400), even if the mother's infection is active. Risk factors for a higher likelihood of transmission at childbirth include the first birth, vaginal birth, and teenage mother.\n\nThere are three big risk factors that contribute to the acquirement of the juvenile variant. These include:\n\nLaryngeal papillomatosis can be diagnosed through visualization of the lesions using one of several indirect laryngoscopy procedures. In indirect laryngoscopy, the tongue is pulled forward and a laryngeal mirror or a rigid scope is passed through the mouth to examine the larynx. Another variation of indirect laryngoscopy involves passing a flexible scope, known as a fiberscope or endoscope, through the nose and into the throat to visualize the larynx from above. This procedure is also called flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy.\n\nThe appearance of papillomas has been described as multiple or rarely, single, white growths with a lumpy texture similar to cauliflower. Papillomas usually present in the larynx, especially on the vocal folds and in the space above the vocal folds called the ventricles. They can spread to other parts of the larynx and throughout the aerodigestive tract, from the mouth to the lower respiratory tract. Spread to regions beyond the larynx is more common in children than adults. Growths tend to be located at normal junctions in squamous and ciliated epithelium or at tissue junctions arising from injury.\n\nA confirmatory diagnosis of laryngeal papillomatosis can only be obtained through a biopsy, involving microscopic examination and HPV testing of a sample of the growth. Biopsy samples are collected under general anesthesia, either through direct laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\n\nLittle is known in terms of effective means of prevention, if the mother is infected with HPV. (HPV vaccination can prevent these infections in the mother, and thereby eliminate the possibility of the virus infecting the baby.) Due to the low likelihood of transmission even from an infected mother, it is not recommended to expose the mother and child to the additional risks of caesarean section to prevent the transmission of this disease during vaginal childbirth. Opting for a caesarean section does not guarantee that transmission will not still occur.\n\nAs of 2014 there was no permanent cure for laryngeal papillomatosis, and treatment options aimed to remove and limit the recurrence of the papillomas. Repeated treatments are often needed because of the recurrent nature of the virus, especially for children, as the juvenile form of laryngeal papillomatosis often triggers more aggressive relapses than the adult form. Between recurrences, voice therapy may be used to restore or maintain the person's voice function.\n\nThe first line of treatment is surgery to remove papillomas. Typically performed using a laryngeal endoscopy, surgery can protect intact tissues and the individual's voice, as well as ensure that the airway remains unobstructed by the disease. However, surgery does not prevent recurrences, and can lead to a number of serious complications. Laser technology, and carbon dioxide laser surgery in particular, has been used since the 1970s for the removal of papillomas; however, laser surgery is not without its risks, and has been associated with a higher occurrence of respiratory tract burns, stenosis, severe laryngeal scarring, and tracheoesophagyeal fistulae. Tracheotomies are offered for the most aggressive cases, where multiple debulking surgery failures have led to airways being compromised. The tracheotomies use breathing tubes to reroute air around the affected area, thereby restoring the person's breathing function. Although this intervention is usually temporary, some people must use the tube indefinitely. This method should be avoided if at all possible, since the breathing tube may serve as a conduit for spread of the disease as far down as the tracheobronchal tree.\n\nA microdebrider is a tool that can suction tissue into a blade, which then cuts the tissue. Microdebriders are gradually replacing laser technology as the treatment of choice for laryngeal papillomatosis, due to their ability to selectively suction papillomas while relatively sparing unaffected tissue. In addition to the lower risk of complications, microdebrider surgery also is reportedly less expensive, less time-consuming, and more likely to give the person a better voice quality than the traditional laser surgery approaches.\n\nFor about 20% of people, surgery is not sufficient to control their laryngeal papillomatosis, and additional nonsurgical and/or medical treatments are necessary. , these treatments alone are not sufficient to cure laryngeal papillomatosis, and can only be considered supplemental to surgery. Some varieties of nonsurgical treatments include interferon, antiviral drugs (especially cidofovir, but also ribavirin and acyclovir), and photodynamic therapy. The monoclonal antibody against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Bevacizumab has shown promising result as an adjuvant therapy in the management of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.\n\nAlthough vaccines are normally used to prevent infections from happening, HPV vaccines can be used therapeutically (after the infection has occurred). For most patients, the HPV vaccine significantly increases the length of time needed between surgeries.\n\nThe evolution of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly unpredictable and is characterized by modulation of its severity and variable rate of progression across individuals. While instances of total recovery are observed, the condition is often persistent and lesions can reappear even after treatment. Factors that might affect the clinical course of the condition include: the HPV genotype, the age at onset, the elapsed time between the diagnosis and first treatment in addition to previous medical procedures. Other factors, albeit controversial, such as smoking or the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease might also play a role in the progression of the disease.\n\nThe papillomas can travel past the larynx and infect extralaryngeal sites. In more aggressive cases, infection of the lungs can occur with progressive airway obstruction. Although rare (less than 1% of people with laryngeal papillomatosis), transformation from a benign form to a malignant form is also observed. Death can result from these complications (morbidity rate is around 1-2%).\n\nLaryngeal papillomatosis is a rare disease with a bimodal distribution based on age of incidence. The incidence, or number of new cases, of laryngeal papillomatosis cases is at approximately 4.3 cases per 100 000 children and 1.8 cases per 100 000 adults annually. The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children peaks before the age of 5, though the term juvenile papillomatosis refers to all cases occurring before the age of 20. The incidence of adult laryngeal papillomatosis, which has an onset after the age of 20, peaks between the ages of 20 and 40. While there are no gender differences in the incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children, adult laryngeal papillomatosis occurs more frequently in males than in females. The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis also varies according to factors such as socioeconomic status, such that higher rates are observed in groups having a lower socioeconomic status.\n\nBecause of its relative commonness and the cost of treatments, more money is spent on treating RRP than any other benign airway tumor.\n\nAs of 2015 use of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine to reduce rate of recurrences had been investigated, but had not yielded significant results.\n\n"}

Unusually for the time, Ballard kept a diary with thousands of entries over nearly three decades, which has provided historians with invaluable insight into frontier-women's lives. Ballard was made famous by the publication of \"A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard based on her diary, 1785–1812\" by historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich in 1990.\n\nMartha Moore was born in Oxford, Province of Massachusetts on the 9th of February 1735, to the family of Elijah Moore and Dorothy Learned Moore. Nothing is known about her childhood and education, but it is known that her family had medical links; her uncle Abijah Moore and brother-in-law Stephen Barton were physicians. She married Ephraim Ballard in 1754. The couple had nine children between 1756 and 1779, but lost three of them to a diphtheria epidemic in Oxford between June 17 and July 5, 1769.\n\nBallard delivered 816 babies over the 27 years that she wrote her diary and was present at more than 1,000 births; the mortality rates of infants and mothers that she visited were ordinary for the United States before the 1940s. Her diary also recorded her administering medicines and remedies, which she made herself mostly from local plants and occasionally from ingredients bought from a local physician. Ballard was sometimes called to observe autopsies and recorded 85 instances of what she called \"desections\" in her diary. She also took testimonies from unwed mothers that was used in paternity suits. She testified in 1789 in a high-profile case of a judge accused of raping a minister's wife. In addition to her medical and judicial responsibilities, Ballard frequently carried out tasks such as trading, weaving, and social visits. She and her family experienced difficult times during 1803–1804, when her husband was imprisoned for debt and her son was indicted for fraud. Ballard's obituary was published on June 9, 1812 in the \"American Advocate\" and simply stated:\n\nBallard was related to Clara Barton, known for her American Civil War work and for founding the American Red Cross. Clara was the granddaughter of Ballard's sister, Dorothy Barton.\n\nFrom when she was 50 (1785) until her death in 1812, Martha Ballard kept a diary that recorded her work and domestic life in Hallowell on the Kennebec River, District of Maine. The log of daily events, written with a quill pen and homemade ink, records numerous babies delivered and illnesses treated as she travelled by horse or canoe around the Massachusetts frontier in what is today the state of Maine. For 27 years, she wrote in the diary daily, often by candlelight when her family had gone to bed.\n\nThe diary consists of more than 1,400 pages, with entries that start with the weather and the time. Many of her early records are short and choppy, but her later entries are longer and detailed. Her writing illustrates struggles and tragedies within her own family and local crimes and scandals. One includes the comment that children in New England are allowed to choose their romantic interest if they were in the same economic class, rare for the time. Many of the people mentioned in the diary do not appear on official records, such as censuses or deeds and probate, and so the diary helps to provide insight into the lives of ordinary people who might otherwise have remained invisible. Because of the scale of the diary, scholars have been able to use digital tools to mine it for information. Such studies have revealed, for instance, that because Ballard's deliveries spike significantly between February and April, her neighbours are most likely to be having sex between May and July.\n\nThe last birth that Ballard attended was on April 26, 1812. Ballard's final diary entry, from 1812, states: \"made a prayer adapted to my case.\" After Ballard's death, the diary was kept by Dolly Lambard. The diary was then passed on to Dolly's daughters, Sarah Lambard and Hannah Lambard Walcott after Dolly's death in 1861. Sarah Lambard and Hannah Lambard gifted the diary to Ballard's great-great-granddaughter, Mary Hobart, one of the first female US physicians to graduate from the New York Infirmary for Women and Children in 1884, the same year that she received the diary.\n\nIn 1930, Hobart donated the diary to the Maine State Library in Augusta. Maine State Library promised Hobart a transcript of the diary, but the promise was never fulfilled. Charles Elventon Nash included parts of the diary in a proposed two-volume history of Augusta, which was kept in a descendant's home for almost 60 years before the descendant offered it to the Maine State Library. Edith Hary took the papers and published \"The History of Augusta: First Settlements and Early Days As A Town Including The Diary of Mrs. Martha Moore Ballard\" in 1961.In July 1982, E. Wheaton of the Maine State Archive created a microfilm copy of the diary. Robert R. McCausland and Cynthia MacAlman McCausland later spent ten years producing a verbatim transcription on the diary, which they made freely available online as well as for purchase in hard-copy.\n\nFor many years, Martha Ballard's diary was not considered to be of scholarly interest since it was generally dismissed as repetitive and ordinary. However, historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich saw potential in the diary, realising how rare Ballard's first-hand account was after having researched a previous book on women in early New England. After eight years of research, Ulrich produced \"A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard based on her diary, 1785–1812\". Each chapter in \"A Midwife's Tale\" represents one aspect of the life of a woman in the late 18th century. The overriding theme is the nature of women's work in the context and community. Ulrich stated that:\n\nSupporting documents construct Ulrich's interpretation of terse and circumspect diary entries, dealing with medical practice and the prevalence of violence and crime. In \"A Midwife’s Tale\", Ulrich highlights ten key entries from Martha's diary. Ulrich places these entries in a historical context, elevating a seemingly-ordinary woman's life into a key figure of Kennebec. Listed below are summaries of each key entry of the diary and its historical significance. \n\nThe first entry in \"A Midwife’s Tale\" puts midwifery in a broader medical context within the Kennebec region. This chapter establishes the relationship between doctors and midwives during this time period. Doctors were called only to perform extreme medical practices such as bloodletting and typically had 8-10 cases per year. Martha recorded 816 births over 27 years, and midwives were the first called when a woman went into labor. Ulrich also introduces the concept of “social medicine” in this chapter, referring to the sharing of information among midwives and doctors. This is evident in midwife manuals and communities of midwives that gathered and interacted during births.\n\nThis chapter shows the separate economy among women in Hallowell. The economy is facilitated by the \"social webs\" of production and consumption. Martha's diary separates roles of men and women. Men were involved in the politics of the town whereas women had a separate community where they exchanged textiles. Martha's daughters were able to take over the work of spinning and weaving and helping with harvests when they became older, which allowed Martha to have the time to devote to midwifery. Without Martha's detailed records of her exchanges, historians would lack the knowledge of the economy that existed among women. \n\nThis entry follows an important rape trial in Hallowell. Mrs. Foster accused Judge North of raping her while her husband was away. Historians are able to contrast Martha's account of the trial with Henry Sewall's account. Henry Sewall opposes the Fosters' religious beliefs, but Martha feels sympathetic toward the Fosters because others judged them for their religious beliefs. \n\nThis section is concerned with the three Ballard family marriages that occurred in 1792. Martha describes all three weddings, but it is noteworthy that while two are fairly domestic, one is quite dramatic. The mid-18th century is seen as a turning point in history since children began to choose their own partners, which is supported by Ballard's diary entries. It seems as if all of the Ballard marriages in 1792 were courtships chosen by the children, as opposed to arrangements proposed for economic benefits. Additionally, pre-marital sex is mentioned.\n\nThis chapter details the 53 deliveries that Ballard performed in 1793, an important year for her. She delivers babies from celebrity wives like those of Captain Molloy and Esquire Hayward but also babies of servants. Ballard travels far and wide to deliver babies, which she discusses in her diary entries as well. Ulrich emphasizes that an average of one baby a week seems easy, but Martha often sits for weeks doing nothing and, for others, facing multiple births in a short time during poor weather. Additionally, women have contractions that do not result in labor, forcing them to decide between risking it and not calling for Martha or having her come without actually needing her. That happened at the Parker house, to where she traveled four times before actually delivering the baby, number 51.\n\nThe focus is 1796, a physically taxing year for her and her husband. She is traveling to deliver babies in flea-infested cabins while her husband works in swamps swarming with mosquitos. Their children also have some health issues that year. In November, her husband, Ephraim, is at muskie-point, and all of his instruments were stolen at the outset of a planned extended surveying journey, canceling the trip, but he returns five days later. On the same day or around the same time, Martha delivered her 600th baby, a milestone. Ephraim’s work continues to be difficult. Martha prays for strength to continue faring through her difficult and laborious life.\n\nThis section follows the death and autopsy of John Davis, the son of John Vassall Davis in Kennebec. This is an important death in the diary because John Davis is legally a bastard with a prominent father in Kennebec. Ulrich fleshes out the significance of Martha's presence at the autopsy. Her presence was a common practice for midwives in her time. Ulrich discusses the change in 1820, when a Harvard Medical School professor publishes a treatise stating that women should no longer be midwives as they are too uneducated to practice medicine. \n\nThis chapter tracks Martha's entries while her husband, Ephraim Ballard, is in jail for debt. During this time, Martha's son, Jonathan, takes over Matha and Ephraim's house. Entries highlight Martha and Jonathan's rocky relationship. Additionally, Martha experiences a pseudo-widowhood during this time, acknowledging Ephraim's role in the household that now must be filled by her son. This entry gives important information regarding jail time in Kennebec, as Ephraim is allowed to continue working during the day and must sleep at the jail only at night. There is flexibility regarding cases of debt. \n\nThis chapter is centered around a mass murder that occurred in Hallowell. James Purrinton, one of Martha's neighbors, murdered his wife and all of his children but one, who escaped. Martha's entry adds another viewpoint on this historic event. Ulrich writes, \"The economy of Martha's telling contrasts with the more self-conscious narrative published (and probably composed) by Peter Edes, editor of Augusta’s Kennebec Gazette.\"\n\nThe final chapter focuses on Martha's perspective on the Malta War between settlers and proprietors over land ownership. The insurgents were led by Elijah Barton, Martha's nephew. Additionally, Ulrich discusses the importance of women in field agriculture, as characterized by Martha’s garden and her records of the flowers and vegetables she planted in her time. As Martha grows older, her diary recounts fewer births. Ulrich hypothesizes that the decrease in births is caused by another midwife taking over her work. The midwife is likely Ann Mosier since after Martha records Ann's death, Martha's workload increases. The chapter concludes with Martha's last entry on May 7 and her death approximately three weeks later.\n\nThe book received a positive critical response and was praised for its insight into the lives of 18th-century women and life in early New England. In 1991, \"A Midwife's Tale\" received the Pulitzer Prize, the Bancroft Prize, the John H. Dunning Prize, the Joan Kelly Memorial Prize in Women's History, the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians Book Prize, the Society for Historians of the Early Republic Book Prize, the William Henry Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine, and the New England Historical Association Award.\n\nIn 1997, the PBS series \"The American Experience\" aired \"A Midwife's Tale\". This documentary film was based upon Ulrich’s book, and Ulrich served as a consultant, script collaborator, and narrator for the film. It was directed by Richard P. Rogers, and produced by Laurie Kahn-Leavitt. Actress Kaluani Sewell Lee played Martha Ballard. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities. When filming the series, details were given close attention. The production crew chose King's Landing Historical Settlement in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island to capture Maine's three seasons: \"black flies, snow and mud.\" The actors wore mud-soaked shoes below historically-accurate costumes, and replicas were made of the hand sewn booklets that formed the diary, so that Lee could write in them. The music in the film, played by the ensemble Orison, included shape note singing by the Word of Mouth Chorus.\n\n"}

Before graduating high school, he worked at KYA radio in San Francisco delivering on air high school sports reports. After college, Somers began hosting a news talk show on KABL radio in San Francisco long before the talk radio format became popular. To that effect, \"Time Magazine\" ran a story naming him the youngest talk show host in the country at that period of time. Somers also worked a public address announcer for the NBA's San Francisco Warriors.\n\nIn 1970, Somers joined KPIX in San Francisco as a weekend sports anchor and won a San Francisco Press Club Award.

He spent his first few years with the station as the overnight host. During this time he conducted one of the last ever interviews with Mark Koenig, who was the last living member of the 1927 New York Yankees. He later spent a few years co-hosting the 10am-1pm slot with WWOR-TV sports anchor Russ Salzberg. The program was titled \"The Sweater and the Schmoozer.\" At that time, Somers developed some of the quirks that have been hallmarks of his WFAN tenure, dropping catchphrases such as \"schmoooooozing S-P-O-R-T-S\" (spelling out the word \"sports\"), giving time checks in minutes and seconds, uniquely reading the end of the station's phone number as \"six-six-six-six\" rather than the standard \"sixty six-sixty six\", joking at the expense of engineer Eddie Scozzare (\"THE Eddie Scozzare?\" \"No, Eddie Maple, who do you think we're talking?\"), and reading the catalogue numbers of live commercials (\"LV-242, for those of you scoring at home, and I know you are...\").\nHe is also known to refer to the New York Mets, by one of their nicknames (which is not the official name) \"The New York Metropolitans\" drawing out the parts as Metro-Politans, and referring to the Islanders as the Ice-landers.\n\nCurrently, Somers usually works during the evening on weekdays. His program can be heard anywhere from 6:30pm to 2am, depending on whether WFAN airs a sporting event that night. He is also sometimes heard on weekends.

During this latter conflict, he served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Marines commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams.

However, Childs proved to be no match for the convict 'old hands'. His 'strict discipline' may have worked on the thoroughly disciplined men of the Royal Marines, but he had no experience of life in a penal settlement. General discipline was poor and left to subordinate guards and overseers who had little control over the prison which was ruled by the 'Ring' of hardened convicts. A visiting magistrate reported that while Childs was \"a most amiable benevolent gentleman and honorable officer\" what was needed to avoid anarchy and insubordination was \"an officer of experience in, or capacity for, government, judgement, energy, decision and firmness\". Childs was recalled but, before he left, a group of convicts revolted in July 1846, murdering four officials. Thirteen convicts were convicted of murder and hanged by Childs' successor, John Price, who considered Childs responsible for the state of affairs that led to the revolt. A newspaper report at the time blamed the situation on Childs' \"utter imbecility\".\n\nChilds returned to England and continued to serve in the Royal Marines.

Always outspoken, a dispute with national team management saw him not play the 1995 World Cup, where his team desperately needed him in the tough pool that included South Africa and Australia.\n\nFollowing a dominant performance in the 1991 World Cup, he was named to the World Team (as selected by Rugby World magazine), and was subsequently chosen to play for the world selection Barbarians against the World Champions Australia at Twickenham in 1992. His locking partner for the Barbarians that day was All Black Ian Jones. He went on to represent the Barbarians another four times. He was named Athlete of the Year in his home town of Victoria, B.C. following the World Cup in 1991.\n\nWhile working in London and playing for Wasps, he gained perhaps his greatest notoriety for roughing up two hooligans on the London Underground, an act which not only earned him praiseworthy column inches in the British broadsheets and tabloids, but even gained him a mention in the House of Commons by then Prime Minister John Major. Already a well-known pundit on BBC TV's Rugby Special live weekly program, offers for more TV appearances followed. Stormin' Norman was later named in Britain's glossy Total Sport Magazine (August 1997 issue, \"The Blood and Guts, Hard Issue\") as one of the World's 12 Toughest Sportsmen alongside Lance Armstrong and F1 racer Johnny Herbert. (Among the \"Sporting Sissies\" were boxers Roberto Durán and Riddick Bowe).\n\nIn Australia's Inside Sport Magazine – \"Rugby World Cup 2003 Issue\" (Inside Sport November 2003 # 143 pg. 70), Aussie Captain and legend John Eales named his Top 5 World Cup \"Bolters from the Blue\". \"Stormin’ Norm Hadley, the impressive Canadian from 1991\" (playing in the same position as Eales) was #3 on the list. All Black phenomenon, Jonah Lomu was #1 for his exploits in 1995 and the entire Western Samoa team came in at #2 for their efforts in the 1991 tournament. (Ivory Coast came in at #4 for making it to the 1995 event. World Cup (1991) winning Australian Wallaby winger Rob Egerton was #5).\n\nNorman has one daughter, Madison Elle Watson. He was the grandson of celebrated Academy Award-winning cinematographer Osmond Borradaile.\n\nAt the age of 51, after many years of battling depression, chronic pain and suspected Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), Hadley ended his life on 19 March 2016. The Tokyo Medical Examiner determined the cause to be an overdose of Pentobarbital. His death was announced on 27 March 2016\n\n"}

It bypasses Branson on the Ozark Mountain High Road and is the namesake of the Branson strip, 76 Country Blvd. The road runs for its entirety through the Missouri Ozarks, and is at times very hilly and curvy.\n\nRoute 76 begins at Willow Springs. Within a couple of miles, the highways enters the Mark Twain National Forest, which it leaves after . At the Douglas County line it begins a concurrency with Route 181. North of Vanzant is an intersection with Route 95, and further west is the northern junction with Route 5. On the west side of Ava, Route 76/Route 5 has an intersection with Route 14, and south of Ava, Route 76 will turn west off Route 5.\n\nAt Brownbranch, the highway enters another part of the Mark Twain National Forest, and at Bradleyville, it has a short concurrency with Route 125. At Kissee Mills, the road turns west with U.S. Route 160 and the two are united to Forsyth. At Forsyth, Route 76 leaves US 160 and crosses Bull Shoals Lake. At Branson, the road crosses Lake Taneycomo and meets U.S. Route 65.\n\nRoute 76 runs concurrent with US 65 for before exiting onto the Ozark Mountain Highroad Freeway. While on the freeway, Route 76 has an interchange with Route 248. At the west end of the highroad, Route 76 returns to its original route at an incomplete interchange, connecting with Route 376. On the west side of Branson, a concurrency with Route 265 begins; at Branson West, a concurrency with Route 13 begins. At Reeds Spring, Route 76 turns west towards Cape Fair. At Cape Fair is the southern terminus of Route 173. \n\nAt the Barry County line, Route 76 enters the Mark Twain National Forest for a third time. Eight miles () into the forest is a short, one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency with Route 39. At the west limits of the national forest, Route 76 unites with Route 86; they are concurrent for . At Cassville is a short concurrency with Route 112 and an intersection with Route 37. The road becomes less winding and hilly in this area.\n\nAt Wheaton, Route 86 turns north. Route 76 continues west through McDonald County. At Anderson, Route 76 has an interchange with Interstate 49/U.S. Route 71, and just west is a two-mile (3 km) concurrency with Route 59. Seven miles west of Anderson, the highway joins Route 43, turning north with that highway three miles. At the northwest junction, Route 76 turns west for one mile (1.6 km) and enters Tiff City. The western limit of Tiff City is the Oklahoma state line, where Route 76 becomes a county road on the county line of Ottawa County and Delaware County, Oklahoma.\n\nRoute 76 was initially designated in 1922, running from south of Spokane to Forsyth. The longer Route 78 passed through Forsyth on its path between Branson and the northeast corner of Taney County. In about 1929, Route 76 was extended west to Reeds Spring, and in the early 1930s Route 78 was extended northeast to Ava. With the extension of Route 80 west from Gainesville in the 1930s or 1940s, Route 78 west of Forsyth became part of Route 80, and the rest was absorbed into Route 76, which now connected Reeds Spring to Ava. US 160, designated in Missouri in the mid-1950s, initially followed Route 80 to Branson. It later moved to Route 76 west of Forsyth, and Route 76 was extended west via Branson, replacing part of Route 148 and much of Route 44. Route 44 had been designated in 1922 from Anderson to Abesville, and later extended west to Tiff City and east to Rockaway Beach. In the late 1950s, it was split up due to I-44, becoming Route 76 west of Cassville, Route 148 from Cassville to Galena, and a new Route 176 from Galena to Rockaway Beach.\n\nIn 1967-68 Route 76 was extended from Route 5 two miles north of Ava east along former State Route F through northeast Douglas County and other county roads to US 60/US 63 at Willow Springs in Howell County. This added approximately 53 miles plus a four-mile concurrence with Missouri Route 5 west of Ava.\n\nPrior to January 2020, Route 76 ran along 76 Country Boulevard through Branson, where many of the entertainment theaters for which Branson is famous can be found. This alignment was plagued with traffic during much of the day and especially towards show start and end times (usually around 6-8 PM and 9-10PM). Now, Route 76 runs concurrent with US 65 for to the Ozark Mountain High Road, replacing Route 465.

The Ontario Parks system covers over , which is about 10 percent of the province's surface area or the equivalent of an area approximately equal to Nova Scotia. It falls under the responsibility and mandate of the province's Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. It was formerly under the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.\n\nThe Ontario Parks system is often used as the model for other parks systems in North America. This can be attributed to its delicate balance of recreation, preservation, and conservation. Many parks in Ontario also offer a Natural Heritage Education program.\n\nThe Ontario Parks system began its long and rough history in 1893 with the creation of Algonquin Park, originally designed to protect loggers' interests from settlement. The management and creation of provincial parks came under the Department of Lands and Forests in 1954 and led to a period of accelerated park creation: a ninefold increase in the number of parks over the next six years. In the 1970s the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources' (MNR) was formed. The MNR expanded to include forestry operations within the Province, becoming the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) in approximately 2010, and became more focused on Forestry and species protection and enforcement via Conservation Officers. Currently, Ontario Parks does not have full agency status, but is a branch of the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP), but, interestingly, Park Wardens are still employed by the MNRF and not the MECP. Until recently, Ontario Parks as a whole was under the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF).\n\nThe history of Ontario's provincial parks stretches for over 100 years. Here are some of the milestones from the past century plus:\n\n1893 – Algonquin Park is created as a public park and forest reservation, fish and game preserve, health resort and pleasure ground.\n\n1894 – Rondeau becomes Ontario's second provincial park.\n\n1913 – The Parks Act sets aside land not suitable for agriculture or settlement.\n\n1954 – Ontario still has only 8 provincial parks: Algonquin, Quetico, Long Point, Rondeau, Presqu'ile, Ipperwash, Lake Superior and Sibley (now known as Sleeping Giant).\n\nA Division of Parks is created within the Department of Lands and Forests. This heralds a new and aggressive program to create more parks, primarily on the Great Lake and northern tourism highways.\n\n1960 – There are now 72 provincial parks in Ontario, hosting over 5 million visitors annually.\n\n1967 – Ontario introduces a new policy that divides parks into specific categories, or classes, with compatible sets of uses.\n\n1970 – Polar Bear, Ontario's largest provincial park at 24,000 square kilometres, is created.\n\n1978 – Ontario Provincial Parks: Planning and Management Policies are approved by Cabinet giving Ontario one of the world's leading parks planning systems.\n\n1983 – The new land use planning system leads to the announcement of 155 new parks to be designated.\n\n1985 – There are now 220 parks in Ontario encompassing over 5.5 million hectares of land.\n\n1993 – Ontario celebrates the centennial of the provincial parks system and Algonquin's 100th anniversary.\n\n1996 – The provincial parks system adopts a new entrepreneurial operating model where revenue generated by parks can be reinvested in the parks system. This is symbolized by a new name, Ontario Parks, and a new visual identity.\n\n1996 – Ontario Parks partners with the Natural Conservancy of Canada to create Legacy 2000, a program to protect significant natural areas. Under this agreement more than 11,000 hectares are secured.\n\n1999 – Ontario's Living Legacy is announced. This land use strategy identifies 378 new protected areas, including 61 new parks and 45 parks additions. Ontario's Living Legacy will protect over 2.4 million hectares of land, including additions to the provincial parks system of over 900,000 hectares.\n\n2001 – Ontario now has a total of 280 provincial parks encompassing 7.1 million hectares or almost 9 percent of the province's area. Over 9 million visitors annually enjoy Ontario Parks.\n\n2007 – Introduction of new legislation: \"Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act\" with 329 provincial parks and 292 conservation reserves.\n\n2018 - Ontario Parks changes hands from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) to the newly created Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks. All employees including Park Wardens are now employed by the Ministry of Environment Conservation & Parks \n\n2018 - Ontario celebrates 125 years of the provincial parks system and Algonquin's 125th anniversary\n\nOntario Parks system uses a classification system to divide the provincial parks into the following categories:\n\n, Ontario Parks system manages 65 recreational class parks (394.8 km), six cultural heritage class parks (67.4 km), 80 natural environment class parks (14,675.3 km), 109 nature reserve class parks (1,152 km), 62 waterway class parks (14,446.2 km), and 8 wilderness class parks (48,237.5 km).\n\n"}

{"id": "2154132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154132", "title": "Downtown (owarai)", "text": "Downtown (owarai)\n\nAs a result of their massive popularity and the relative domination of their employer, Yoshimoto Kogyo, the Kansai dialect (in which both performers usually speak) has come to be associated with Japanese comedy (\"owarai\") as a whole. In 2011, NSC (comedy school) teachers reportedly noted that 70 percent of students name Matsumoto and Hamada as being among their key inspirations.\n\n\n\nMatsumoto and Hamada attended and met at Ushio Elementary School in Amagasaki, Hyōgo of the Kansai region. They did not become friends until their second year in Amagasaki Taisei Junior High School, where they both joined the school's broadcasting club and called each other and . It is then Matsumoto joked about becoming a comedy duo together and planted the idea into their heads. At the time, Matsumoto was part of a \"manzai\" trio called \"Koma Daisanshibu\" with two of his classmates, Itō and Morioka.\nOne day, Matsumoto's \"manzai\" partner, Itō, had an argument with Hamada which escalated into a street fight. Hamada won, and prompted Matsumoto to leave with him. Matsumoto was unsure of what to do, but started walking in the same direction as Hamada because it was the opposite direction from Itō's house. This incident marked the beginning of Downtown.\n\nThey were split apart when they entered different high schools. The Hamada entered was very strict, and Hamada attempted to escape several times. Whenever he escaped successfully, he called Matsumoto for help, hiding at his home for several days before being caught by his teachers. Hamada repeated the cycle of escaping, calling Matsumoto to borrow money to buy food, and being caught again, throughout his high school years. Matsumoto, on the other hand, entered a local tech school, and became the leader of the school band, but quickly started skipping school to hang out with his girlfriend from middle school.\n\nAfter graduating, Hamada had an unsuccessful try at becoming a motorboat racer. Hamada invited Matsumoto to join him to become a comedian. At the time, Matsumoto had a job offer from local publishing company, but he decided to join Hamada. Although Matsumoto's comedy talent agency of choice was Shōchicku Geinō, the two went with Hamada's choice and entered Yoshimoto Kogyo: NSC (New Star Creation) in Osaka. Their first stage name was \"Matsumoto Hamada\". Other names they had were \"Hitoshi Masashi\", \"Teruo-Haruo\", and The \"Wright Brothers\", before settling as \"Downtown\", a name they picked from a magazine. They made their major debut in 1983.\n\nMatsumoto and Hamada received positive comments from older comedians in NSC, but went without a single chuckle from the audience, sometimes receiving insults from hecklers. They organized performances of their sketches and routines by themselves, but could not get people to listen, even if tickets were free. Matsumoto describes these early years as hell, showing his immense frustration and stress during this period. They even considered quitting at one point. Neither made enough money to live on their own, so they had to live with their parents, commuting to the city by train for performance opportunities. Ironically, Matsumoto had to search for a part-time job in a magazine printed by the printing company that he had originally been supposed to enter after graduating high school.\n\nDespite the hardships, they gradually increased their fan-base and status. In April 1987 (four years after their debut) they began hosting a local television show called \"Yoji Desu Yōda\" (\"It's Four O'Clock\"), which immediately raised them to idol-like popularity in the region (music singles, videos and photo books in which they posed like fashion models were released), especially among high school girls. After a tearful farewell concert, they ended the show and moved to Tokyo in 1989, making various appearances on low rating TV programs before making their big break with their long-running variety show \"Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!\". From that point, they went on to create several other successful variety shows, such as \"Downtown no Gottsu Ee Kanji\", \"Downtown DX\" and the music-centric \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ\".\n\nAs with many Japanese comedy duos, there exists a \"boke\" and a \"tsukkomi\". Matsumoto is the \"boke\" of the two and often puts up with light physical abuse (it is common for the \"tsukkomi\" to slap the \"boke\" on top of his head whenever he says something rude or ridiculous) from Hamada, the \"tsukkomi\". Hamada is also known to attack other \"tarento\" and celebrities when they give \"boke\"-like responses to Downtown's questions. In a very recent skit where Downtown and the other Gaki members were presented with the autonomous robot Pepper Hamada even slapped the robot on its head. Hamada's aggressive ways have earned him the nickname of , or \"Hamada the Super Sadist.\"\n\nBut occasionally, they switch their roles as a skit about Hamada being immortal, had Hamada in the Boke and Matsumoto in the Tsukkomi role. With Hamada telling stories about how he survived several accidents which would have put any other in the hospital and with Matsumoto addressing the audience in a very dry tone \"Aho ya.\" (What an idiot)\n\nThe early 1980s prominently featured quick, snappy styles of \"manzai\", but Downtown took the opposite approach, using a slow, mumbling tone which baffled older comedians. While other duos performed \"manzai\" facing the audience, Downtown would face each other as if they were simply conversing, ignoring the presence of the audience. Their contribution to \"manzai\" is immeasurable; it has been remarked that \"manzai\" will never be the same after Downtown, and many aspiring comedians have copied parts of Downtown's style. It is notable that Downtown never had a mentor (it was common for younger comedians to be \"trained\" by older, more experienced comedians) which was essential to the development of their own, unorthodox style.\n\nIn the group's early years, many recognized Downtown's talent, but doubted Downtown would ever succeed due to their sluggish style, which was so drastically different from that of mainstream \"manzai\". Shinsuke Shimada, a leading \"manzai\" comedian, had been one of the doubters until he saw one of Downtown's performances. Shimada was startled by how funny and complex Downtown was, and immediately announced his retirement from \"manzai\". In his press conference, Shimada cited Downtown as the major reason for his retirement, but the press ignored the comment, since the duo had very little popularity at the time, writing instead that Shimada had felt outclassed by a different \"manzai\" duo; Saburo-Shiro. Shimada's decision proved to be correct however, as Downtown dominated \"manzai\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Downtown and Shimada have developed a close bond over the years, and Matsumoto co-hosts a TV talk show (\"Matsushin\") with Shimada.\nThough Matsumoto and Hamada are now regarded as \"geniuses\" of their respective roles, it is unjust to laud them only for their talent. Matsumoto made a change from being a quieter character to his current, ill-tempered style, while Hamada had to repeatedly apologize for brash comments in variety shows. Upon hearing that many fans regarded Hamada as the crux of the group, Matsumoto embarked upon an array of solo skits to prove himself, while Hamada relentlessly studied other groups' \"tsukkomi\" to improve upon his own skills.\n\nAnother important aspect of Downtown's comedy is their willingness to make themselves the butt of the joke. While many popular manzai comedians become elevated to the level where poking fun at them is out of the question, Downtown has always taken ridiculous roles in shows, even after becoming popular. This is particularly evident in \"Gaki No Tsukai\" where they endure countless physical and mental punishments, such as their punishment games. Generally, these roles are reserved for younger, less popular comedians, but Matsumoto and Hamada relish these roles even after becoming part of the elite of Japanese entertainment.\n\nDowntown has not performed a \"manzai\" routine since 1991, though the free talk session on \"Gaki No Tsukai\" can be considered the final form of Downtown's \"manzai\".\n\nYoshimoto Kōgyō is very much a Kansai operation, although it is not limited to people from Osaka and its surroundings. Most of its comedians speak Kansai-ben, the strong, earthy dialect that developed among the merchant classes of Osaka, as opposed to the more elegant tones of Kyoto or the standard language of the Edo (now Tokyo) aristocracy.\n\nMatsumoto and Hamada have never lost the dialect and have used it to their benefit. They use it in the titles of their TV shows—translations of \"Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende\" (\"Not An Errand Boy!\"—\"\"Gaki no Tsukai dewa Naiyo!\"\" in standard Japanese) or \"Gottsu Ee Kanji\" cannot be found in a standard dictionary. Downtown's popularity have turned these expressions into common vocabulary.\n\nAlthough they appear to be best friends on their shows, Hamada and Matsumoto admit they are not as close as one may think. On their many hosted shows and interviews, the two have made the following revelations:\n\nOn \"Music Champ\", Matsumoto stated they see each other so often at work, the thought of meeting in private never crosses their mind. During an interview with PUFFY, he was impressed by how the two singers spend time together as friends despite having to work together all the time as a duo—he turned to Hamada and told him, \"I'd rather eat off the floor than go out to dinner with you.\"\n\nThis does not mean, however, they do not get along outside of work. Though they do not consider each other to be friends, their deep business relationship and respect for each other is evident. Hamada has said if they ever parted ways, he would \"never do comedy again,\" as there is no one else he would like to make his partner (Matsumoto has expressed similar views). He has also said he saves his best \"tsukkomi\" material for Matsumoto. Tanaka of Cocorico reports seeing Matsumoto become visibly concerned whenever Hamada is sick and unable to come to work.\n\nMatsumoto has said that if the duo ever split up, they would like to perform their manzai one last time at Namba Grand Kagetsu, Yoshimoto Kogyo's theatre in Osaka and the very stage on which Downtown launched their career.\n\nDowntown currently host the following programs every week:\n\n\n\nFrom October 22, 2013 Downtown will host the academic research and variety show , replacing \"Lincoln\" in its Tuesday ten o'clock slot on TBS.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by KSPS Public Television. KSPS-TV's studios are located on South Regal Street in Spokane, and its transmitter is located on Krell Hill southeast of Spokane. \n\nOn cable and satellite, the station can be seen in high definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 107 in the Spokane area, Charter Spectrum channel 1221 in the Coeur d'Alene area and the Palouse, Idaho, and channel 7 (in both standard and high definition) on Dish Network and DirecTV.\n\nOn April 24, 1967, KSPS-TV first signed on the air, from the basement of Adams Elementary of Spokane Public Schools. It was affiliated with National Educational Television (NET), and moved to its successor network, PBS, on October 5, 1970. A series of school levy failures in the early 1970s forced the station to secure alternate funding and, in 1972, Friends of Seven, now known as Friends of KSPS, was founded to provide financial support to KSPS.\n\nOn July 26, 2012, the board of Spokane Public Schools voted unanimously to spin off KSPS to the Friends of KSPS. A day later, the Friends of KSPS board also voted unanimously to move forward with taking full control of the station. The transition from an educational license to a community license was completed in fall 2013. School board employees working for KSPS would become employees of the non-profit organization. Gary Stokes, the executive director of the Friends of KSPS, says that he hopes to \"keep things as business-as-usual as possible. That includes keeping the employees a part of our station.\" Friends of KSPS has become the primary financial supporter for the station in recent years and Stokes said he believed that his organization was in a position to take over the station outright. The station plans to remain at Ferris High School in the short term; the school board has no plans to sell the building in which the station is located. Soon after the sale closed and the station officially became a community-licensed station, Friends of KSPS changed its trading name to KSPS Public Television.\n\nKSPS provides programing from PBS and local sources. The station's main signal reaches parts of Washington and Idaho, and it operates a translator network covering parts of Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Montana. It is also carried on cable in most of Alberta and parts of British Columbia, and on satellite systems across western Canada. Montana and Alberta are on the Mountain Time Zone, and programs are viewed one hour later by local time.\n\nA significant portion of the station's donations and viewing audience comes from Calgary and Edmonton. Calgary and Edmonton each have populations which are more than double the entire population of KSPS's American coverage area, and most of the station's members live in those two cities. Not only must KSPS take its large Canadian audience into account in its programming, but a significant portion of its donations are in Canadian dollars. It is one of five local Spokane TV stations seen in Canada on Shaw Cable.\n\nIt was the first station to carry Mary Ann Wilson's \"Sit and Be Fit\" program, as KSPS serves as the primary production studio and distributor of the series since it debuted in 1987.\n\nOn November 29, 2006, ice and wind caused the top 200 feet (60 meters) of the station's antenna at the Krell Hill transmission site to collapse, disrupting its off-air signal. Other area television broadcasters promised to lend short-term support. Cable and satellite feeds in the U.S. and Canada were not affected, as fiber is used to transmit the signal to the head ends. Over-the-air broadcasts were interrupted for almost a month while the tower was being repaired.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKSPS-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 8 to channel 7 for post-transition operations.\n\nThe following translators re-broadcast KSPS-TV:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Note that some of the translators on this list are confirmed on the KSPS-TV website but they do not have any known FCC data.

In Camdenton, it crosses U.S. 54, and continues northwest, crossing the Lake of the Ozarks. After crossing the lake, Route 5 diverges north, and Route 7 heads west to another concurrency with US 65. The combined route crosses Harry S. Truman Reservoir and the Osage River and then enters Warsaw, where the concurrency ends; Route 7 heads west and crosses more arms of the Truman Reservoir. At Clinton, it intersects Route 13 and Route 52, and then becomes a four-lane highway, running northwest to Interstate 49/US 71 in Harrisonville. After a brief concurrency with I-49/U.S. 71, Route 7 heads north as a two-lane highway, crossing Route 58 in Pleasant Hill, Route 150, and US 50. In Blue Springs, it crosses US 40 and I-70. Continuing north, Route 7 is the eastern terminus of Route 78, before itself terminating at US 24 in Independence.\n\nMissouri Route 7 links the Kansas City area to the Ozarks, however it was not always called Route 7. Starting in 1926-27 it connected US 71 to US 50 only, by 1937 it had been extended to US 40. The section that runs east from US 71 - US 65 (1935), to US 54, and later on to US 66 (1953)was once called State Route 35. This was changed to Route 7 in 1959. In the early 1970s with the creation of Truman Lake, the Osage River Bridge was bypassed with a new mile long span. \n"}

It runs through the region known in ancient times as Phrygia. It was considered one of the principal rivers of Asia Minor (Anatolia) in classical antiquity, and is mentioned in the \"Iliad\" and in \"Theogony\". Its name appears in different forms as Sagraphos, Sangaris, or Sagaris. \n\nIn \"Geographica\", Strabo wrote that during classical antiquity, the river had its sources on Mount Adoreus, near the town of Sangia in Phrygia, not far from the Galatian frontier, and flowed in a very tortuous course, first in an eastern, then in a northern, then in a northwestern, and lastly again in a northern direction through Bithynia into the Euxine (Black Sea). In one part of its course it formed the boundary between Phrygia and Bithynia; and in early times Bithynia was bounded on the east by the river. The Bithynian part of the river was navigable, and was celebrated for the abundance of fish found in it. Its principal tributaries were the Alander, Bathys, Thymbres, and Gallus.\n\nThe source of the river is the \"Bayat Yaylası\" (Bayat Plateau) which is located to the northeast of Afyon. Joined by the \"Porsuk Çayı\" (Porsuk Creek) close to the town of Polatlı, the river runs through the \"Adapazarı Ovası\" (Adapazarı Plains) before reaching the Black Sea. The Sakarya was once crossed by the Sangarius Bridge, constructed by the East Roman Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565).\n\nIn the 13th century, the valley of the Sakarya was part of the frontier between the Byzantine Empire and the home of the Söğüt tribe. By 1280, Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII had constructed a series of fortifications along the river to control the area, but a flood in 1302 changed the course of the river and made the fortifications useless. The Söğüt tribe migrated across the river and went on to establish the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFrom downstream to upstream, the Sakarya has four dams: Akçay, Yenice, Gökçekaya and Sarıyar.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Tegna Inc., as part of a duopoly with CBS affiliate KREM (channel 2). The two stations share studios on South Regal Street in Spokane; KSKN's transmitter is on Krell Hill southeast of Spokane. There is no separate website for the station.\n\nOn cable and satellite, the station can be seen in high definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 111 in the Spokane area, Charter Spectrum channel 1212 in the Coeur d'Alene area and the Palouse, and channel 22 (in both standard and high definition) on Dish Network and DirecTV.\n\nKSKN signed on the air on October 1, 1983 as an independent competitor to KAYU-TV (channel 28). The station featured a general entertainment format consisting of classic cartoons from 6 to 9 a.m., religious shows from 9 a.m. to noon, classic sitcoms from noon to 2:30 p.m., new cartoons from 2:30 to 5 p.m., recent sitcoms from 5 to 7 p.m., movies from 7 to 9 p.m., a mix of old and recent sitcoms from 9 p.m. to midnight, and movies during the overnight hours. Weekends consisted of more movies and drama shows. The station had good ratings, but overspent on programming. The original owners, Lee Shulman's Broadcast Vision Television, filed for bankruptcy in the summer of 1985. The station scaled back operations to daily from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. The station added more barter shows and dropped the stronger programming. In the fall of 1985, KSKN was sold to Sun Continental Group. The new owners, former owners of KMSB in Tucson, returned the station to stronger programming and added most of the shows the previous owners lost.\n\nHowever, once principal Gene Adelstein died in March 1986, financial troubles returned. In February 1987, the station trimmed two and a half hours out of its broadcast day; in March, the station filed for bankruptcy again, and in May, it began airing home shopping programs 10 hours a day. On June 27, 1987, the ailing station went off the air. These owners also filed bankruptcy in April 1987. After a 1990 attempt to return the station to air with the ill-fated Star Television Network failed, the station remained off the air until emerging in late 1994 with Home Shopping Network programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with the exception of several hours on Sunday morning when they ran religious and educational children's shows.\nIn July 1996, KSKN entered into a local marketing agreement with KREM, which was owned by The Providence Journal Company at the time. The station became an affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN), after KAYU-TV (channel 28) carried the network for its first two seasons, and carryed its prime time programs and a couple hours a day of cartoons were added in afternoons in pattern. The station was re-launched early in 1997 with an overhaul of programming. Home Shopping Network programming was relegated to overnights; daytime hours consisted of cartoons until 9 a.m. and from 3 to 5 p.m., sitcoms from 9 a.m. to noon, talk and reality shows from noon to 3 p.m., sitcoms from 5 to 8 p.m. and from 10:30 p.m. to midnight, and a newscast at 10 p.m.\n\nIn 1999, the station joined The WB as secondary affiliate after the Superstation feed of Chicago's WGN-TV dropped the network as there was enough stations nationwide to carry it. KSKN aired both networks (with WB programming airing from 6 to 8 p.m. and UPN from 8 to 10 p.m.) til 2002, when it dropped its UPN affiliation and became a primary WB affiliate (UPN would return to Spokane a year later when KQUP signed on). It would gradually began dropping weekday cartoons from 1999 to 2006, due to changes in the broadcast industry. Belo, who bought out ProJo back in 1997, bought KSKN outright in October 2001. In January 2006, it was announced that The WB and UPN would merge in September 2006 to form The CW Television Network. It was confirmed on April 10 that KSKN would become the new affiliate for The CW. On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo. The sale was completed on December 23, making KSKN Gannett's first CW-affiliated station outside of digital subchannels under its ownership. KSKN became the first station in Spokane to air their news (sister station KREM) from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. in September 2014. On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KSKN and KREM were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn December 6, 2011, Belo announced it signed affiliation agreements with KSKN and Seattle sister station KING-TV to add Live Well Network to their digital subchannels; Live Well Network replaced Universal Sports on digital subchannel 22.2 effective January 1, 2012, as Universal Sports transitioned into a cable and satellite channel during the first quarter of 2012.\n\nKSKN discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 22.\n\nSome of KSKN's current syndicated programming offerings include \"The People's Court\", \"Maury\", \"Extra\", \"Friends\", and \"Family Guy\".\n\n"}

Drewsey is along the main stem of the Malheur River, about east of Burns, off U.S. Route 20. It has the ZIP Code of 97904.\n\nThe region around Drewsey was frequented by Paiute tribes long before white settlers arrived. They caught salmon in the river and its tributaries and hunted and foraged on the land. Subsequent clashes between the two cultures led to creation of the Malheur Indian Reservation, which included the Drewsey area, in 1872. There the Paiutes and others were expected to learn about white culture and to become farmers. After further clashes, the Indians were re-located from the Malheur region to reservations elsewhere in the West. By the early 1880s, settlers began establishing themselves in and around Drewsey.\n\nAbner Robbins opened a store here in 1883 and named the place \"Gouge Eye\" to commemorate a local dispute. When Robbins applied for a post office, postal authorities did not accept the original name, so he changed it to \"Drusy\". When the office was established in 1884, however, it was registered under the name \"Drewsey\".\n\nDrewsey grew rapidly in the late 19th century, depending on farming and ranching for its economic base. The Pacific Livestock Company, two lumbers mills, and other businesses thrived here through the 1920s. However, bypassed by the nearest east−west railway as well as the main highway, Drewsey lost population during the Great Depression and after. In the 21st century, Drewsey consists of a small number of homes, a combined garage and store with a post office, a tavern and restaurant, two churches, and an elementary school.\n\nDrewsey has a steppe climate (Köppen Csb).\n\nAlthough Drewsey is officially in the Pacific Time Zone. Some residents choose to unofficially observe the Mountain Time Zone due to close proximity to Malheur County.

The film was a West German/American co-production, shot mainly at the Bavaria studios.\n\nLoosely based on a 1971 novel, \"Viper Three\" by Walter Wager, it tells the story of Lawrence Dell, a renegade USAF general who escapes from a military prison and takes over an ICBM silo in Montana, threatening to launch the missiles and start World War III unless the President reveals a top secret document to the American people about the Vietnam War.\n\nA split screen technique is used at several points in the movie to give the audience insight into the simultaneously occurring strands of the storyline. The film's title, which functions on several levels, is taken from \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", the national anthem of the United States:\n\nAfter escaping from a military prison, rogue Air Force General Lawrence Dell and accomplices Powell, Garvas, and Hoxey infiltrate a Montana ICBM complex that Dell helped design. Their goal is to gain control over its nine Titan nuclear missiles. The infiltration does not go as planned, as the impulsive Hoxey guns down an Air Force guard for trying to answer a ringing phone. Dell then shoots and kills Hoxey. The three then make direct contact with the US government (avoiding any media attention) and demand a $10 million ransom and that the President go on national television and make public the contents of a top-secret document.\n\nThe document, which is unknown to the current president but not to certain members of his cabinet, contains conclusive proof that the US government knew there was no realistic hope of winning the Vietnam War but continued fighting for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the Soviet Union their unwavering commitment to defeating Communism.\n\nMeanwhile, Dell and his two remaining men remove the security countermeasures to the launch control system and gain full control over the complex.\n\nWhile the President and his Cabinet debate the practical, personal, and ethical aspects of agreeing to the demands, they also authorize the military to send an elite team led by General MacKenzie to penetrate the ICBM complex and incinerate its command center with a low-yield tactical nuclear device. Just as the device is about to be set, the commando team accidentally trips an alarm, alerting Dell to their operation. A furious Dell responds by initiating the launch sequence for all nine missiles. As the military and President Stevens watch the underground missile silo launch covers begin to open, they agree to call off the attempt and the launch is aborted with mere seconds to spare. During this time, the captive Air Force guards attempt to overpower Dell and his men, resulting in the death of Garvas and another guard.\n\nEventually, the President agrees to meet the demands, which include allowing himself to be taken hostage and used as a human shield while Dell and Powell make their escape from the complex. As the president leaves the White House, he asks the Secretary of Defense to release the document should he be killed in the process. US Air Force snipers take aim and shoot both Dell and Powell, but also accidentally shoot the President, who with his dying breath asks the Secretary of Defense if he will release the document. The Secretary cannot bring himself to answer.\n\n\n\"Viper Three\" by Walter Wager was published in 1971. Film rights were purchased that year by Lorimar Productions. \n\nLorimar were known for making TV series like \"The Waltons\" and \"Eight is Enough\" and TV movies like \"Sybil\" and \"Helter Skelter\". They wanted to move in feature film production and \"Twilight's Last Gleaming\" - as it would be known - would be their first.\n\nAccording to Aldrich, Lorimar \"couldn't get it [a film of the novel] financed. Every actor in town had seen it - including Burt Lancaster... If you hadn't already seen it, you were going to see it. Or you knew one or two pictures that were kind of like it... There was no social impact. The kidnappers had no interesting motivation. The reasons they wanted to get the President weren't even PLO-type reasons. They just wanted the money. That didn't seem to me to make much sense.\"\n\nLorimar took the project to Aldrich, who said he \"wondered what would happen if you had an Ellsberg mentality, if you had some command officer who came out of Vietnam and who was soured not by war protestors but by the misuse of the military... What would happen if you had a general who was angry at the political use of the armed forces? \"\n\nAldrich told Lorimar he would do the film \"if I could turn that story upside down.\" Aldrich pitched his take on the material to Burt Lancaster who agreed to do the film. \n\nLancaster called the film \"\"All the President's Men Part Two\"... a very powerful political piece couched in highly melodramatic terms.\"\n\nLorimar took the project to a German company who agreed to put up two thirds of the budget. The finance came from German tax shelter money.\n\nMerv Adelson, head of Lorimar, described the movie as \"the perfect formula picture... an action-adventure picture that appeals to the international market. Pre sell it to television and abroad. Have all our money back before it opens domestically.\"\n\nAdelson would later become disillusioned with this formula because the films did not achieve much critical acclaim, and if they did not perform domestically Lorimar did not make that much money out of them.\n\nLancaster and Aldrich thought the President could be a John F. Kennedy type. Lancaster approached Paul Newman to play the role, but he was not enthusiastic. So, Aldrich reconfigured the character as a Mayor Daley type politician.\nThe writers Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch wrote the script together over six weeks. Aldrich called it \"the most unlikely marriage in the world. Huebsch's a little wizened old man, sixty-two, sixty-three years old, been in the political wars for forty years, probably the most knowledgeable political analyst in town - or at least up there with Abe Polonsky and Ring Lardner. And Cohen is a loud-mouthed, extroverted, young, smart-ass guy who knows that he votes Democratic... an extraordinarily gifted writer in terms of what people say and how they say it. The script was originally 350 pages.\n\n\"If that movie's anti-American so is Jimmy Carter,\" said Aldrich. \"The most inflammatory statement in the movie is that it opts for open government.\"\n\nAldrich decided to use split screen and multiple panels. \"I don't particularly like panels unless they're in a bread commercial. But I thought they fitted that particular movie. They cost me an extra half a year - half a year. But you couldn't tell that story in less than three hours without them.\"\n\nAldrich normally used Joseph Biroc as cinematographer but Biroc's wife fell ill before shooting so Aldrich used Robert Hauser.\n\nFilming took place in Munich in August 1976.\n\nSeveral scenes were shot with Vera Miles as the president's wife but were cut to save time.\n\nAldrich said he hoped the audience came to realise that the Lancaster character was crazy. \"But I don't think we did it. The audience is so much for those guys getting away with it.\" He also did not feel it was ambiguous enough at the end as to whether the shooting of the president was intentional.\n\nThe film did poorly at the box office.\n\nIn France it recorded admissions of 88,945.\n\nIt was unsuited for videocassettes, because the split-screen effects do not work well in low resolution of that format. After the rights reverted to the film's German co-producers, a major remastering effort was done by Bavaria Media, who released a Blu-ray edition, distributed in the United States by Olive Films in 2012.\n\n\n"}

It is serviced by the following bus routes operated by the London Transit Commission, two terminals at Jalna Boulevard which provide bus routes 4A, 4B and 93 and 4 terminals at the Wellington Road entrance which provide bus routes 10, 13, 13A, 14, 28, 30 and 90. The mall is expected to be the southern terminus of one route on the planned London Rapid Transit system.\n\nThe property on which the mall is now located was originally occupied by a small outdoor plaza, built in 1962, before major development began in the surrounding neighborhoods. In 1972, the plaza was completely rebuilt to make way for expansion. It became a fully enclosed shopping center in 1973, anchored by Woolco in addition to 150+ stores.\n\nThe mall's first major expansion in 1976 brought in a Simpson's department store, after a major renovation to the old Savette. A long hall of stores that deviated west from the original race-track lay-out was also added at that time. The mall saw rapid growth in the 1980's as it competed with other shopping centers in London. Over a period of half a decade, the mall saw no fewer than three major expansions. The first occurring in 1983 with a Mark's and Spencer's, a food court which replaced the Loblaw's grocery store, and several other new stores. Almost immediately after a brand new wing began construction and opened in 1986.

It is located near the geographic center of the Quad Cities.\n\nThe bridge was designed by engineer Ralph Modjeski. The first span opened in 1935 as a toll bridge. In 1961, an identical twin span, built from the same blueprint, opened to facilitate increased traffic demands. Tolls were discontinued in 1970. The twin spans were merged with Interstate 74 in 1975.\n\nBuilt for a daily crossing of 48,000 vehicles, the daily average is 80,000, making it by far the most traveled bridge in the Quad Cities. Both the Interstate 80 and 280 bridges are up to Interstate standards, while the Interstate 74 Bridge is functionally obsolete and was not built to Interstate standards, as it has two narrow lanes, no shoulder, and a 50 mile-per-hour (80 km/h) speed limit.\n\nThe I-74 Corridor Study was completed to study replacing the bridge with a larger one with 4 lanes in each direction. The study claimed that the I-74 Bridge project would spur economic growth, create construction jobs, reduce traffic backups, and improve air quality.\n\nFunding for the construction of the new bridge has been earmarked for $22 million in 2017 and $50 million in 2018. Former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn said the state is committed to bridge improvements to help traffic flow and \"boost economic growth in the region\".\n\nAs of 2012, the Illinois Department of Transportation also budgeted more than $34 million for engineering, design and land acquisition for the new bridge. The conceptual design of the arch bridge was completed by CH2M Hill and Boston-based bridge designer Miguel Rosales from Rosales + Partners. Final design was completed by Modjeski and Masters in association with Alfred Benesch & Company. The portion of the bridge spanning the Mississippi River is estimated at more than $700 million, while the project as a whole, including all approach routes and connectors, is estimated at $1.2 billion.\n\nWhile on a tour at the base of the bridge in Bettendorf in May 2012, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said that, in comparison with other bridges that he has seen in other states, the current I-74 Bridge is one of the worst he's seen.\n\nThe new bridge will be just upstream of the existing bridge and will be a basket-handle, true-arch twin bridge with four lanes in each direction and a pedestrian/bicycle path. A ground-breaking ceremony for the new bridge was held on June 26, 2017. The westbound bridge is expected to be completed in late 2019 and the eastbound span is expected to be completed in late 2020. The existing I-74 bridge is anticipated to be removed in 2021. Winter weather conditions and the resulting high water over an extended period of time, however, have created delays and the opening of the first span has been pushed to the first half of 2020.\n\n\n"}

An equivalent term to this definition would be Reptiliomorpha. Anthracosauria has also been used to refer to a smaller group of large, crocodilian-like aquatic tetrapods also known as embolomeres.\n\nAs originally defined by Säve-Söderbergh in 1934, the anthracosaurs are a group of usually large aquatic Amphibia from the Carboniferous and lower Permian. As defined by Alfred Sherwood Romer however, the anthracosaurs include all non-amniote \"labyrinthodont\" reptile-like amphibians, and Säve-Söderbergh's definition is more equivalent to Romer's suborder Embolomeri. This definition was also used by Edwin H. Colbert and Robert L. Carroll in their textbooks of Vertebrate Palaeontology (Colbert 1969, Carroll 1988). Dr A. L. Panchen however preferred Säve-Söderbergh's original definition of Antracosauria in his \"Handbuch der Paläoherpetologie\", 1970.\n\nWith cladistics things have changed again. Gauthier, Kluge and Rowe (1988) defined Anthracosauria as a clade including \"Amniota plus all other tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to amphibians\" (Amphibia in turn was defined by these authors as a clade including Lissamphibia and those tetrapods that are more closely related to lissamphibians than they are to amniotes). Similarly, Michel Laurin (1996) uses the term in a cladistic sense to refer to only the most advanced reptile-like amphibians. Thus his definition includes Diadectomorpha, Solenodonsauridae and the amniotes. As Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003) pointed out, this definition is problematic, because, depending on the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda, using it might lead to the situation where some taxa traditionally classified as anthracosaurs, including even the genus \"Anthracosaurus\" itself, wouldn't belong to Anthracosauria. Laurin (2001) created a different phylogenetic definition of Anthracosauria, defining it as \"the largest clade that includes \"Anthracosaurus russelli\" but not \"Ascaphus truei\"\". However, Michael Benton (2000, 2004) makes the anthracosaurs a paraphyletic order within the superorder Reptiliomorpha, along with the orders Seymouriamorpha and Diadectomorpha, thus making the Anthracosaurians the \"lower\" reptile-like amphibians.

Soloway is known for creating, writing, executive producing and directing the Amazon original series \"Transparent\", winning two Emmys for the show; directing and writing the film \"Afternoon Delight\", winning the Best Director award at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival; and producing \"Six Feet Under\".\n\nSoloway identifies as nonbinary and gender non-conforming, using gender-neutral \"singular they\" pronouns.\n\nSoloway was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, to public relations consultant, coach and writer, Elaine Soloway, and psychiatrist Dr. Harry J. Soloway, who grew up in London. Around 2011, Dr. Soloway came out as transgender.\n\nSoloway's elder sister, Faith, is a Boston-based musician and performer with whom Jill sometimes collaborates. Both Jill and Faith attended Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago. Jill Soloway graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a communications arts major.\n\nSoloway's mother was formerly a press aide to Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne and was a former communications director for School Superintendent Ruth Love. After 30 years, Soloway's parents divorced. Soloway has a stepfather named Tommy Madison.\n\nWhile at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Soloway was a film and television student of JJ Murphy and participated in the creation of an undergraduate experimental narrative film entitled \"Ring of Fire\" as the assistant director under director Anita Katzman. After college Soloway worked as a production assistant in commercials and music videos in Chicago, as well as at Kartemquin Films on the movie \"Hoop Dreams.\"\n\nWhile in Chicago, siblings Faith and Jill Soloway co-developed a parody of \"The Brady Bunch\" for live stage called \"The Real Live Brady Bunch,\" which began their professional theatrical writing and directing endeavors. They also sold a pilot script to HBO called \"Jewess Jones\" about a female superhero. Also at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago, the pair created plays \"The Miss Vagina Pageant,\" and later, while in Los Angeles, \"Not Without My Nipples\".\n\nWith Maggie Rowe, Soloway co-created \"Hollywood Hellhouse\" and \"Sit n' Spin.\"\n\nSoloway’s TV writing career began on shows such as \"The Oblongs\", \"Nikki\" and \"The Steve Harvey Show\". Soloway followed those shows by writing for four seasons on the HBO original series \"Six Feet Under\", ultimately serving as co-executive producer. \"Six Feet Under\" ran for five seasons from 2001 to 2005. Soloway received 3 Emmy nominations in 2002, 2003 and 2005 for Outstanding Drama Series. Soloway's short story, \"Courteney Cox's Asshole\", caught the attention of Alan Ball and led to the job.\"\n\nSoloway later wrote episodes of \"Dirty Sexy Money\", \"Grey's Anatomy\", and \"Tell Me You Love Me\" and was executive producer/showrunner for the second season of Showtime's \"United States of Tara\", created by Diablo Cody, as well as HBO's \"How to Make it in America\", created by Ian Edelman.\n\nIn August 2016, Amazon premiered a Soloway-directed pilot of \"I Love Dick\", based on the novel by the same name by Chris Kraus. It was later picked up for a full season, which premiered on May 12, 2017.\n\nSoloway created the pilot \"Transparent\" for Amazon.com, which became available for streaming and download on February 6, 2014, and was part of Amazon's second pilot season. Faith Soloway and her sibling Jill collaborate, including serving as co-writers on \"Transparent\". They were inspired by their parent who came out as transgender. The show stars Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, and Amy Landecker as siblings whose parent (played by Jeffrey Tambor) reveals she is going through a significant life transition. The pilot for \"Transparent\" was picked up by Amazon Studios.\n\nAs part of the making of the show, Soloway enacted a \"transfirmative action program\", whereby transgender applicants were hired in preference to nontransgender ones. , over eighty transgender people have worked on the show, including two transgender consultants. All the bathrooms on set are gender-neutral.<ref name=\"Vulture-Girls/Trans-2014\"></ref>\n\nSoloway wrote Hoffmann's role on \"Transparent\" especially for Hoffmann after seeing her performance on \"Louie\". \"Transparent\" premiered all ten episodes simultaneously in late September 2014. The show wrapped its fourth season in 2017, and Amazon has renewed it for a fifth and final season to be released in 2019.\n\nSoloway received two Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series in 2014 and 2016 for \"Transparent\" and the show has received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series.\n\nSoloway's first film was a 13-minute short titled \"Una Hora Por Favora\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012. The film stars Michaela Watkins and Wilmer Valderrama. The film tells the story of a woman (Watkins) who hires a day laborer (Valderrama) to do some handy work at her home, but her relationship soon goes beyond professional.\n\nSoloway’s debut at Sundance \"Afternoon Delight\" (2013) won the Directing Award. The film follows Rachel (Kathryn Hahn), a thirty-something woman who is struggling to rekindle her relationship with her husband (Josh Radnor), and ultimately befriends an exotic dancer (Juno Temple). In an interview by IndieWire, Soloway described their personal connection to the film's central character saying, \"There’s a lot of me in Rachel’s journey. I’ve never brought a stripper home, but I’ve always loved reading the memoirs of strippers and sex workers. I feel like they’re the war reporters for women. They go to the front lines of a very particular kind of extreme conflict and live there, then write about it so we can experience it with them.\"\n\n\"Afternoon Delight\" played at national and international film festivals and was nominated for multiple awards, including a Gotham Award for Breakthrough Performance for Kathryn Hahn, and a Spirit Award for First Feature.\n\nIn June 2019, Soloway signed on to write, direct and produce the \"Red Sonja\" remake.\n\nSoloway wrote the novella \"Jodi K.\", which was published in the collection \"Three Kinds of Asking For It: Erotic Novellas,\" edited by Susie Bright. Soloway's memoir, \"Tiny Ladies in Shiny Pants: Based on a True Story\", was released in hardcover in 2005, and then in paperback in 2006. In 2018, Soloway published another book, \"She Wants It: Desire, Power and Toppling the Patriarchy\", with Ebury Press, a division of Penguin Random House.\n\nJewish religion and culture, queer sexuality, and gender are recurring themes in Soloway's show, \"Transparent\". According to Soloway, \"The \"Transparent\" narrative is not, then, just or even mostly about transition and transgender. It’s about big themes like familial secrets and transformation, revelation and change, all of which are rendered through the specificity and magic of television images and sounds, which create imaginative worlds.\"\n\nBesides exploring the theme of transgender, Jill Soloway is a strong advocate of feminism and the female gaze. In September 2016, Soloway delivered a speech at the Toronto International Film Festival and discussed the concept of the female gaze. Soloway divided the female gaze into three parts: reclaiming the female body, engaging the gaze, and returning the gaze. Wanting to be a different director and revolutionize the television arts and film industry, Soloway used this platform to include the female gaze, in an attempt to show the viewers what women would feel, see, and experience when they were being watched by the opposite sex. It was mainly to show the women’s perspective. At a speech at TIFF, Soloway explained that storytelling about the female gaze was a “conscious effort to create empathy as a political tool.” For example, in the television show titled \"I Love Dick\", Soloway describes the show as really about “the female voice...and creating protagonism for women.” According to an article written by Madeline Berg, the show portrays the male character as the object and “used for a sexual end.”\n\nSoloway has said that they have always been writing similar themes, calling it \"The Heroine's Journey,\" which is about \"repairing the divided feminine: the wife and the other woman confronting each other--mom, stripper. That I think women's journeys are really about repairing these sort of divided parts of ourselves. And this divide in our culture that I think is responsible for so much that is a problem in our culture.\"\n\nSoloway has seven Emmy nominations and two wins. Soloway is also a member of the board of the San Francisco Film Society.\n\nIn 2015, Soloway's show \"Transparent\" won a Golden Globe for Best Series - Musical or Comedy. Later that same year, Soloway won a DGA Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for directing episode 1.08 (\"Best New Girl\") of the show. In 2016, Soloway won another Emmy for directing episode 2.09 (\" Man on the Land\") of \"Transparent\". Also in 2016, Soloway was a finalist for \"The Advocate\"'s Person of the Year, and was named to Oprah Winfrey's \"SuperSoul 100\" list of visionaries and influential leaders.\n\nIn 2011, Soloway married music supervisor Bruce Gilbert, with whom Soloway had been in a relationship since 2008. They have a son named Felix Soloway Gilbert. Soloway's older son, Isaac, is from a prior relationship with artist John Strozier. In 2015, Soloway announced being in the process of separating from Gilbert, and that Soloway was in a relationship with poet Eileen Myles, whom Soloway met through \"Transparent;\" their romantic relationship has since ended, and Myles and Soloway held an event at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, in which they \"processed [their] relationship onstage.\"\n\nSoloway lives in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nSoloway is nonbinary and gender non-conforming, and uses gender-neutral \"singular they\" pronouns. In their memoir \"She Wants It,\" Soloway discusses accepting a nonbinary identity at age 50 after filming the first two seasons of \"Transparent.\"\n\nSoloway is a strong supporter of feminism and co-founded the website Wifey.tv which is described as, \"a curated video network for women\" that includes content created by and for women. In an interview by \"Forbes\", Soloway discusses the site saying, \"I really like when our content appears to contradict itself at first glance. One day we might post something about sexism or the male gaze, then the next day post something that might be seen as precisely too sexy or raunchy, but it comes from a female creator or artist so it’s relevant. We love the conversation and don’t feel as dependent on insisting on a particular point of view.\"\n\nSoloway also co-founded the East Side Jews collective, which is funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. The collective \"brings together 20- and 30-something Jews in Silver Lake and the surrounding neighborhoods of Los Angeles for offbeat, too-cool-for-shul events that tend to be heavy on comedy and light on Jewish ritual.\"\n\nSoloway co-wrote \"The Thanksgiving Paris Manifesto\" with Eileen Myles in 2016, which is a feminist manifesto about the pornography industry. The manifesto was posted on topplethepatriarchy.com, a domain purchased by Myles and Soloway. The manifesto opens with, \"We shouldn’t be starting with porn but we must. We support the idea of a porn industry and the idea of people making a living photographing and sharing images of sex but we don’t support an industry that exclusively distributes portrayals of almost exclusively male pleasure and climax.\"\n\n\n"}

Though initially nonpartisan, by the war's last year they were in open alliance with the Republican Party, pro-Union Democrats, and the Union military. The most famous of these clubs were formed in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston and were composed of prosperous men who raised money for war-related service organizations, such as the United States Sanitary Commission, which provided medical care to treat Federal soldiers wounded in battle at a time when the military was ill-prepared for the scale of need. The clubs supported the Republican Party with funding, organizational support, and activism. Union Leagues also existed throughout the land which were created primarily by working-class men. By the spring of 1863, these disparate councils were organized under the Union League of America (ULA) organization which was headquartered in Washington DC. Like-minded organizations aimed at the working class, which became known as Loyal Leagues, were also created in New York. Similar patriotic organizations also existed for women and were known as Ladies Union Leagues.\n\nIn December 1862, the Union League of Philadelphia was the first of the elite eastern Leagues to be established, though the first ULA council had formed in Pekin, Illinois in the summer of 1862. The famous Union League of Philadelphia building on Broad Street in center city Philadelphia, south of City Hall was built in 1865, and is designed in the Victorian style. It is still active, as are the Union League Clubs of New York and Chicago. Membership in the league is selective, and is comparable in social status to membership in a country club. Union League buildings often serve as private social clubs, with areas devoted to drinking establishments, meetings, lectures, libraries, dinners/banquets, speeches/addresses, socializing and relaxing, etc.\n\nDuring the Reconstruction era, Union Leagues were formed across the South after 1867 as working auxiliaries of the Republican Party, supported entirely by Northern interests. They were secret organizations that mobilized freedmen to register to vote and to vote Republican. They taught freedmen Union views on political issues and which way to vote on them, and promoted civic projects. Eric Foner reports:\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan was a secret organization of whites that resisted what they saw as the excesses of Reconstruction. They sometimes terrorized and even assassinated Union League leadership.\n\nAfter the Civil War, members of the Union League Club of New York broadened their support of other philanthropic purposes. For instance, they helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and funded construction of the Statue of Liberty's pedestal and Grant's Tomb.\n\nSome former Union League buildings have been adapted for other uses; for instance, in Brooklyn, New York, the former Union League Club building now serves as a senior citizens' home. The former Union League building in New Haven, Connecticut is used as a restaurant.\n\nIn the post-World War II period, members of the Union League Club of Chicago raised contributions to found the Union League Civic and Arts Foundation in 1949 as a public, not-for-profit charitable and educational organization. The Foundation's mission is one of community enrichment.\n\nFamous historical members of the League in Philadelphia include Cyrus McCormick, Robert Todd Lincoln, Daniel Burnham, William D. Boyce, and Charles D. Barney.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Atlanta-based Cox Media Group. KAYU's studios are located on South Regal Street in Spokane, and its transmitter is on Krell Hill southeast of Spokane.\n\nOn cable and satellite, the station can be seen in high definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 103 in the Spokane area, Charter Spectrum channel 1206 in the Coeur d'Alene area and the Palouse, and channel 28 (in both standard and high definition) on Dish Network and DirecTV.\n\nThe station is also carried on cable systems in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, both of which are double the size of KAYU's American coverage area. One result of this is that stations in Calgary and Edmonton air American shows on Pacific Time, even though Calgary and Edmonton are both on Mountain Time. It is one of five local Spokane area television stations seen in Canada on the Shaw Direct satellite service. It can also been seen on local cable systems in eastern British Columbia.\n\nThe station was founded in 1982 by Spokane native Robert Hamacher and his company, Salmon River Communications. It was Spokane's first independent station, as well as the first new commercial station to sign on in the area since KREM-TV (channel 2) hit the airwaves 28 years earlier. It is also the oldest non-Big Three station in the eastern part of the state. It joined Fox as a charter affiliate in 1986.\n\nOn October 1, 1989, KAYU-TV launched two low-power semi-satellites: K53CY in Yakima (known on-air as \"KCY\"), and K66BW in the Tri-Cities (branded as \"KBW\"). Both stations aired most of KAYU's programming (with the exception of select programs that KAYU did not have the rights to show in those markets), though with local commercials. K53CY was replaced in 1993 by K68EB, though it continued to go by \"KCY\" outside of station identifications. The station also operated a semi-satellite in Wenatchee known as KCWT channel 27 from 1986 until 1990 (now defunct).\n\nSalmon River Communications sold KAYU-TV, along with K68EB (which was soon renamed KCYU-LP), KBWU-LP (the former K66BW), and KMVU in Medford, Oregon, to Northwest Broadcasting in 1995. KCYU and KBWU remained semi-satellites of KAYU until 1999, when sister station KFFX-TV signed on from Pendleton, Oregon and became their parent station; both stations (now KCYU-LD and KBWU-LD) continue to carry KFFX's programming to this day.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, Apollo Global Management acquired the entirety of Brian Brady's television portfolio, as part of a larger transaction that saw it also acquire Cox Media Group. While the company was initially to be known as Terrier Media, it had been announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox's radio and advertising businesses, and maintain the existing Cox Media Group name for the combined company. Brady holds an unspecified minority interest in the company, which gave KAYU an in-state sister station in Seattle's CBS affiliate KIRO-TV.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKAYU-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 28, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 30 to channel 28.\n\nKAYU-TV's 28.2 subchannel broadcasts MyNetworkTV in early primetime; the remainder of the subchannel's schedule consists of Antenna TV programming. Comcast Xfinity carries the subchannel on digital channel 117.\n\nIn November 2017, the 28.2 subchannel was upgraded to 720p HD; it had previously been offered in 480i standard definition.\n\nSyndicated programming on KAYU-TV includes \"The Mel Robbins Show\", \"Tamron Hall\", \"Family Feud\", \"25 Words or Less\", \"The Doctors\", \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Mike & Molly\", \"The Goldbergs\", \"Modern Family\", \"Last Man Standing\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\", among others. KAYU also carries Litton Entertainment's \"Go Time\" E/I block.\n\nKAYU presently broadcasts 13½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 2½ hours each weekday and a half-hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nKAYU currently broadcasts a 10 p.m. newscast produced by NBC affiliate KHQ-TV (channel 6), which airs for 35 minutes on weeknights and a half-hour on Saturdays and Sunday evenings. The station also airs a half-hour show called \"Washington's Most Wanted\", a statewide version of the former Fox series \"America's Most Wanted\", featuring profiles of wanted criminals in Washington state, hosted by KCPQ weeknight anchor David Rose and produced by KCPQ.\n\nOn April 8, 1991, KAYU began broadcasting a 10 p.m. newscast, produced by CBS affiliate KREM (channel 2) under a news share agreement. Lower-than-expected ratings caused KREM to drop out of the news share agreement in 1993, upon which KHQ-TV signed a news share agreement with KAYU. The KHQ-produced newscast ceased production April 14, 1995. In 1999, KAYU produced an in-house 10 p.m. newscast that ran until 2004. ABC affiliate KXLY (channel 4) assisted in content and talent for a short time. In 2004, KAYU partnered with KHQ for the second time to produce the newscast, which was renamed \"Fox First at Ten\". On January 5, 2015, KAYU became the second news station in Spokane to air their news from 7:00–9:00 a.m. called \"Good Day Spokane\", after KREM started aired their news on KSKN at that timeframe back in September 2014.\n\nKAYU-TV is rebroadcast on the following translator stations:\n\n"}
{"id": "2154218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154218", "title": "Moroccan dirham", "text": "Moroccan dirham\n\nThe Moroccan dirham (Arabic: الدرهم, Berber language: \"ⴰⴷⵔⵀⵎ\", Moroccan Arabic: \"Darhem\"; sign: DH; code: MAD) is the official monetary currency of Morocco. It is issued by the Bank Al-Maghrib, the central bank of Morocco. One Moroccan dirham is subdivided into 100 \"centimes\" (cents).\n\nThe Idrissid dirham, a silver coin, was minted in Morocco under the Idrisid dynasty from the 8th to 10th centuries.\n\nBefore the introduction of a modern coinage in 1882, Morocco issued copper coins denominated in \"falus\", silver coins denominated in \"dirham\", and gold coins denominated in \"benduqi\". From 1882, the dirham became a subdivision of the Moroccan rial, with 500 Mazunas = 10 dirham = 1 rial.\n\nWhen most of Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912 it switched to the Moroccan franc. The dirham was reintroduced on 16 October 1960. It replaced the franc as the major unit of currency but, until 1974, the franc continued to circulate, with 1 dirham = 100 francs. In 1974, the santim replaced the franc.\n\nIn 1960, silver 1 dirham coins were introduced. These were followed by nickel 1 dirham and silver 5 dirham coins in 1965. In 1974, with the introduction of the santim, a new coinage was introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 santimat and the 1 and 5 dirham coins. The 1 santim coins were aluminium, the 5 up to 20 santimat were minted in brass, with the highest three denominations in cupro-nickel. New cupro-nickel 5 dirham coins were added in 1980 and changed to a bi-metal coin in 1987. The bi-metal coins bear two year designations for the issue date—1987 in the Gregorian calendar and the 1407 in the Islamic calendar. \n\nThe 1 santim was only minted until 1987 when new designs were introduced, with a dirham replacing the 50 santimat without changing the size or composition. The new 5 dirham coin was bimetallic, as was the 10 dirham coin introduced in 1995. Cupro-nickel 2 dirham coins were introduced in 2002. In 2012, a new series of coins has been issued, with the 5 and 10 dirham coin utilizing a latent image as a security feature.\n\nThe first notes denominated in dirham were overprints on earlier franc notes, in denominations of 50 dirhams (on 5,000 francs) and 100 dirhams (on 10,000 francs). In 1965, new notes were issued for 5, 10 and 50 dirhams. 100 dirham notes were introduced in 1970, followed by 200 dirham notes in 1991 and 20 dirham notes in 1996. 5 dirham notes were replaced by coins in 1980, with the same happening to 10 dirham notes in 1995. In mid-October 2009, Bank Al-Maghrib issued four million 50-dirham banknotes to commemorate the bank's 50th anniversary. The commemorative note measures 147 × 70 mm and features the portraits of Kings Mohammed VI, Hassan II, and Mohammed V. The back of the notes features the headquarters of Bank Al-Maghrib in Rabat. The speech delivered in 1959 by Mohammed V at the opening of Bank Al-Maghrib is microprinted on the back. \n\nIn December 2012, Bank Al-Maghrib issued a 25-dirham banknote to commemorate the 25th anniversary of banknote production at the Moroccan State Printing Works, Dar As-Sikkah. It is the first banknote in the world to be printed on Durasafe, a paper-polymer-paper composite substrate produced by Fortress Paper. The front of the commemorative note features an intaglio vignette and a watermark of King Mohammed VI, and a magenta-green color shift security thread. The thread, like the watermark, is embedded inside the banknote yet visible behind a one-sided Viewsafe polymer window. It also has a fully transparent polymer window embossed with the King's royal crest. The back of the note carries a print vignette commemorating 25 years of banknote printing at the Moroccan State Printing Works, Dar As-Sikkah. The windows in Durasafe are formed by die cutting each side of the three layer composite substrate separately. One-sided Viewsafe windows give a clear view inside the substrate where the thread and the watermark of King Mohammed VI are protected, but fully visible behind the polymer core. The transparent Thrusafe window is created by die-cutting both the outer paperlayers to reveal only the transparent polymer core.\n\nOn August 15, 2013, Bank Al-Maghrib has announced a new series of banknotes. The notes feature a portrait of King Mohammed VI and the royal crown. Each of the notes show a Moroccan door to the left of the portrait, demonstrating the richness of the country's architectural heritage, and symbolizing the openness of the country.\n\nIn 2019, Bank Al-Maghrib issued a 20-dirham banknote produced on polymer substrate to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the accession of Mohammed VI to the Moroccan throne.\n\nPopular denominations are words widely used in Morocco to refer to different values of the currency; they are not considered official by the state, though. Those include the \"rial\" (), equivalent to 5 santimat, and the \"franc\" , equivalent to 1 santim. Usually, when dealing with goods with a value lower than a dirham, it is common to use the rial or santim. For very high priced goods, such as cars, it is normative to refer to the price in santimat. However, rial is used when speaking in Arabic and \"centime\" when speaking in French. \n\nThough not used by the young generation, the denomination 1,000, 2,000, up to 100,000 francs will be used by people who lived during the French colonial period when referring to 10, 20 and 1,000 dirham. Likewise, rial is also used for higher value than portions of the dirham, reaching 5,000 dhs (100,000 rial). This denomination is used in Moroccan Arabic speaking context, especially in popular milieu such as old medina souks or vegetable markets.\n\nThe Moroccan dirham is also accepted in trade markets in Ceuta, despite the prices being displayed in euros.\n\n"}

The original site where Paramahansa Yogananda started Dihika ashram, has been purchased in 1992 by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India and is being maintained by them as a heritage site of the organization. \"In 1997 YSS started a Kendra here. Soon thereafter, a charitable homeopathic dispensary was added. From mid 2010, this Kendra was slowly remodeled into a retreat center with a boundary wall and a guesthouse. Subsequently, the work of constructing a Dhyana Mandir — with an accommodation for about 75 devotees — has been completed at this site.\"\n\nOn March 7, 2017, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi released the commemorative postage stamp honoring the 100th anniversary of the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India, founded by Yogananda. The Prime minister stated that though Paramahansa Yogananda left the shores of India to spread his message, he always remained connected with India.\n\nYogoda Satsanga Society of India oversees more than 180 Kendras, Mandalis, Retreats, Ashrams throughout India and Nepal where weekly services, group meditations, and other programmes are held. Sunday School classes for children are also offered at many locations.\n\n\"Dakshineshwar Ashram\": Paramahansa Yogananda wrote to Rajarsi Janakananda from Calcutta during his visit to India in 1935-36, \"You would be pleased to know that I have been working incessantly for creating a permanent centre in Calcutta, the crown city of Bengal, and I think I am almost successful.\"\n\nIn 1946 Yogananda wrote in his \"Autobiography of a Yogi\", \"A stately Yogoda Math in Dakshineswar, fronting the Ganges, was dedicated in 1939. Only a few miles north of Calcutta, the hermitage affords a haven of peace for city dwellers. The Dakshineswar Math is the headquarters in India of the Yogoda Satsanga Society and its schools, centres, and ashrams in various parts of India.\"\n\nRanchi Ashram: It was here, in Ranchi, in 1917, that Paramahansa Yogananda began his life's work with the founding of an ashram and a \"How-to-Live\" school for boys, and to make available the universal teachings of Kriya Yoga. The living quarters of great Guru during the early years is preserved as a shrine. The room is open to all for private meditation throughout the day.\n\nDwarahat Ashram: The YSS Ashram is located about 1.5 km from the Dwarahat town, in Almora district of Uttarakhand State and is surrounded by pine forest on all sides.

They speak the Lak language. Laks historically live in the Lakskiy and Kulinskiy districts of Dagestan. This ethnocultural area is known as Lakia. There are about 200,000 ethnic Laks.\n\nThe word \"Lak\" is the self-designation of the Lak people as in Lak expressions: \"zhu Lak buru\" — we are Lak; \"zhu Lakral khalq buru\" — we are Lak people; \"Laktal\" — Laks; \"Lakssa\" — Lakian, Laks, Lak man; \"Lakkuchu\" — Lakian man; \"Lakku maz\" — Lakian language; \"Lakkuy\" — Lakia; \"Lakral kanu\" — Lak place; \"Lakral kanu\" — Lak district; \"Lakku bilayat\" — Lak country; \"Lakral pachchahlug\" — Lak state. Laks use the name \"Lak\" as their ethnonym and placename.\n\nP. K. Uslar (1864) reported on the use of self-designation \"Lak\" by residents of Gazi-Kumukh: \"Lakkuchu, Lakkuchunal, nominative plural Lak, genitive Lakral — Kazikumukh man; Lak — the name of the whole country; ta uri Lakkuy — he lives in Kazikumukh; ta nai uri Lakkuya — he comes from Kazikumukh; ta Lakku mazray galga ti uri — he speaks in Kazikumukh language; Lakku adat — Kazikumukh custom; Lakral kanu — Kazikumukh, lit. the place of Lak people\".\n\nRussian army generals and historians A. V. Komarov (1869) and N. F. Dubrovin (1871) in their distinct writings on the history and ethnography of Caucasus mentioned that the self-designation of the residents of Gazi-Kumukh was \"Lak\" whom they named \"Laki\" (Laks).\n\nIn the population census of Dagestan Oblast of 1886 the residents of Kazikumukh Okrug were named \"Laki\" (Russian \"Лаки\"). On the schematic map of the Dagestan Oblast of 1895, compiled by historian and ethnographer E. I. Kozubskiy, the residents of Kazikumukh Okrug are called \"Laki\".\n\nKumukh historically was a fortress-city where the residence of the rulers of Lak people was. Kumukh is the ancient capital of Lakia. The history of the Laks can be divided into several parts. The first part is the era of Anushirwan, who appointed a ruler called Kumukh. In the 6th century Kumukh was one of the political centers in the highlands of Dagestan. The second part is the era of the shamkhals of Kumukh, who were first mentioned as the rulers of the Laks in the 8th century. In the 13th century the shamkhals of Kumukh accepted Islam and Lakia became an Islamic state. In the 15th century Kumukh became the main Islamic and political center of Dagestan. The third part is the era of the khans of Kumukh who opposed the colonial policy of Persia, Russia and Turkey.\n\nMost Laks believe in Sunni Islam (Shafi'i school). Sunni Islam encourages group solidarity; their members help each other find work and housing, arrange marriages, pay the kalim, maintain burial societies, resolve disputes, and so forth. The first mosque of the Lak people was built in 777-778 in Kumukh. Historian A. V. Komarov (1869) wrote: \"Laki and in particular the residents of their main village of Gumuk were among the first Dagestani tribes who accepted Mohammedanism ... Abu Muselim himself went to Gumuk and built there a mosque in 777 AD as the inscription on the mosque reads\". According to Al-Masudi the residents of Kumukh in the 8th century were Christians. Shamkhals of Kumukh embraced Islam at the end of the 13th century. In the 14th century Kumukh became the gazi-center and was named Gazi-Kumukh. In the 15th century shamkhals played a role in spreading Islam in Dagestan.\n\nAccording to prof. Gadjiyev A.G., Lak people belong to the Northcaucasian race: \"Our research in 1961 has led to some clarification of the area of Caucasionic race (Northcaucasian race) in Dagestan. In this paper the groups that belong to Caucasionic race are those of western variant. These are the Ando-Tsunti people and the bulk of Avars, Laks, Dargin. According to the specifics of pigmentation, but not the size of the face, Rutuls are close to them\".\n\nThe description of the coat of arms of Kulinskiy District reads: \"In the gold field stands a green peaked mountain that has a gold chain with four clusters of pendants; above the chain mountain is silver and on a mountain top — an eagle, black, with golden eyes, beak and feet, facing to the right and turning with outstretched wings\". Green mountain with silver snow-capped peaks corresponds to the lands of Kulinsky district. Eagle symbolizes freedom and spiritual uplift of Laks. Gold chain is the national decoration. Golden field symbolizes the space filled with sunlight. The flag and the coat of arms of the Lakskiy District is of blue color which depicts the fortress, two daggers, an eagle and the crown.\n\nBecause the traditional Lak lands are mountainous and very dry, agriculture was of secondary importance in the traditional economy. In the mountainous regions, the economy was dominated by the raising of sheep and goats, and also some horses, cattle, and mules. Meat and milk products were major components of the Lak diet, although they also grew barley, peas, wheat and some potatoes. Most animal husbandry was the responsibility of males, whereas agriculture was mostly that of women. The Lak territory had no forests, and there was a chronic shortage of wood for building and fuel. Wheat and fruits and vegetables were grown in the lower areas, especially in the new Lak areas in northern Daghestan.\n\nThe practice of transhumant sheepherding required that for several months each year, males moved to the lowlands to pasture their animals. Here they came into contact with different Daghestani peoples. Other Daghestani mountaineers grazed their sheep along with those of the Laks in the lands of the Kumyks. This is why most Lak males were multilingual. Many villages specialized in artisanry and crafts. Kumukh was famed for its jewelers and coppersmiths; Kaya was known for its merchants and markets; Unchukatl for saddle and harness makers; Ubra for masons and tinsmiths; Kuma for candy makers; Shovkra for shoe- and bootmakers; Tsovkra for acrobats; and Balkar for ceramics and jug makers. Lak women also engaged in cottage industries such as rug weaving, spinning, textile making, and ceramics, whereas the men engaged in leather working and tool making.\n\nMany of these traditions survived during the Soviet period because it was difficult to develop the Lak territories, which are isolated and have few resources. Textiles and clothing, leather working and shoe making, and the production of meat, cheese, and butter are still the dominant industries in this region. Many Laks continue to migrate (both permanently and seasonally) to other areas of Daghestan (and in particular to the cities) and to other surrounding areas to find employment. Whereas in the traditional pattern of transhumant animal husbandry, Lak males and their animals walked over the treacherous mountain passes and forded rivers, the herds are now taken by truck to their winter pastures in the lowlands and similarly brought back in the spring. Traditionally, extended families held the limited amount of agricultural land, the pastures, and the herds in common and did not have a strong sense of individual ownership. The Laks nevertheless resisted Soviet collectivization policies.\n\nTraditionally Laks, like most Daghestani highlanders, lived in patriarchal clan units (tukhums) consisting of a large extended family having a common ancestor, either recently deceased or still living. All members had the same patronymic and all property was owned mutually by the clan; decision making was the responsibility of either the elder patriarch or the elder males. Clan members were expected to provide mutual assistance in work and in family affairs, and to assume collective responsibility in vendettas, as prescribed by adat (traditional Daghestani customary law that predates Islam). The term for close family members within the tukhum is kk'ul, and they refer to each other as usursu (sibling). The importance of tukhums is today being eroded by modernization and continuing emigration.\n\nMarriages were traditionally arranged by the families of the couple, with the oldest women taking the most prominent role in the decision making. The bride and groom were most likely to be from the same clan. The custom of paying kalïm (bride-price) persists to a limited degree, but the transaction is more symbolic than financial.\n\nThe Laks are reported to have been the first Dagestani people to establish a feudal system. Their feudal society consisted of the khans; the bagtal (beks), who were the khan's family and the nobility; the chankri (children of marriages between beks and women of lower social orders); the uzdental (uzden), who were free peasants (numerically the largest of all classes); the rayat (serfs); and the laghart (slaves). This feudal system coexisted with a system of free societies, which were composed of the more democratic tukhums. These free societies were military and economic arrangements that were fluid in structure and worked on a democratic and voluntary basis. The laws governing the relations of groups within these free societies were codified in adat.\n\nThe native language of all Laks is the Lak language. Lak is a member of the highly diverse Northeast Caucasian language family. Within the family, its position is highly debated, but it is generally thought to be an isolate, which either developed separately from an early point or, alternatively, a language of whose close relatives all have gone extinct.\n\n"}
{"id": "2154225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154225", "title": "Psocoptera", "text": "Psocoptera\n\nPsocoptera are an order of insects that are commonly known as booklice, barklice or barkflies. They first appeared in the Permian period, 295–248 million years ago. They are often regarded as the most primitive of the hemipteroids. Their name originates from the Greek word ψῶχος, \"psokhos\" meaning gnawed or rubbed and πτερά, \"ptera\" meaning wings. There are more than 5,500 species in 41 families in three suborders. Many of these species have only been described in recent years.\n\nThey range in size from 1–10 millimeters (0.04–0.4 in) in length.\n\nThe species known as booklice received their common name because they are commonly found amongst old books—they feed upon the paste used in binding. The barklice are found on trees, feeding on algae and lichen. No member of this order is currently considered endangered; in fact, in 2007, \"Atlantopsocus adustus\", a species native to Madeira and the Canary Islands, was found to have colonized the mild Cornish coast of southwest England.\n\nIn the 2000s, morphological and molecular evidence has shown that the parasitic lice (Phthiraptera) evolved from within the psocopteran suborder Troctomorpha. In modern systematics, Psocoptera and Phthiraptera are therefore treated together in the order Psocodea.\n\nPsocids are small, scavenging insects with a relatively generalized body plan. They feed primarily on fungi, algae, lichen, and organic detritus in nature but are also known to feed on starch-based household items like grains, wallpaper glue and book bindings. They have chewing mandibles, and the central lobe of the maxilla is modified into a slender rod. This rod is used to brace the insect while it scrapes up detritus with its mandibles. They also have a swollen forehead, large compound eyes, and three ocelli. Their bodies are soft with a segmented abdomen. Some species can spin silk from glands in their mouth. They may festoon large sections of trunk and branches in dense swathes of silk.\n\nSome psocids have small ovipositors that are up to 1.5 times as long as the hindwings, and all four wings have a relatively simple venation pattern, with few cross-veins. The wings, if present, are held tent-like over the body. The legs are slender and adapted for jumping, rather than gripping, as in the true lice. The abdomen has nine segments, and no cerci.\n\nThere is often considerable variation in the appearance of individuals within the same species. Many have no wings or ovipositors, and may have a different shape to the thorax. Other, more subtle, variations are also known, such as changes to the development of the setae. The significance of such changes is uncertain, but their function appears to be different from similar variations in, for example, aphids. Like aphids, however, many psocids are parthenogenic, and the presence of males may even vary between different races of the same species.\n\nPsocids lay their eggs in minute crevices or on foliage, although a few species are known to be viviparous. The young are born as miniature, wingless versions of the adult. These nymphs typically molt six times before reaching full adulthood. The total lifespan of a psocid is rarely more than a few months.\n\nBooklice range from approximately 1mm to 2mm in length (1/25\" to 1/13\"). Some species are wingless and they are easily mistaken for bedbug nymphs and vice versa. Booklouse eggs take 2 to 4 weeks to hatch and can reach adulthood approximately 2 months later. Adult booklice can live for six months. Besides damaging books, they also sometimes infest food storage areas, where they feed on dry, starchy materials. Although some psocids feed on starchy household products, the majority of psocids are woodland insects with little to no contact with humans, therefore they are of little economic importance. They are scavengers and do not bite humans.\n\nPsocids can affect the ecosystems in which they reside. Many psocids can affect decomposition by feeding on detritus, especially in environments with lower densities of predacious micro arthropods that may eat psocids. The nymph of a psocid species, \"Psilopsocus mimulus\", is the first known wood-boring psocopteran. These nymphs make their own burrows in woody material, rather than inhabiting vacated, existing burrows. This boring activity can create habitats that other organisms may use.\n\nSome species of psocids, such as \"Liposcelis bostrychophila\", are common pests of stored products. Psocids, among other arthropods, have been studied to develop new pest control techniques in food manufacturing. One study found that modified atmospheres during packing (MAP) helped to control the reoccurrence of pests during the manufacturing process and prevented further infestation in the final products that go to consumers.\n\nThe order Psocoptera is divided into three suborders.\n\nTrogiomorpha have antennae with many segments (22–50 antennomeres) and always three-segmented tarsi.\n\nTrogiomorpha is the smallest suborder of the Psocoptera \"sensu stricto\" (i.e. excluding Phthiraptera), with about 340 species in 7 families, ranging from the monospecific fossil family Archaeotropidae to the speciose Lepidopsocidae (over 200 species).\nTrogiomorpha comprises infraorder Atropetae (extant families Lepidopsocidae, Psoquillidae and Trogiidae, and fossil families Archaeotropidae and Empheriidae) and infraorder Psocathropetae (families Psyllipsocidae and Prionoglarididae).\n\nTroctomorpha have antennae with 15–17 segments and two-segmented tarsi.\n\nTroctomorpha comprises the Infraorder Amphientometae (families Amphientomidae, Compsocidae, Electrentomidae, Musapsocidae, Protroctopsocidae and Troctopsocidae) and Infraorder Nanopsocetae (families Liposcelididae, Pachytroctidae and Sphaeropsocidae). Troctomorpha are now known to also contain the order Phthiraptera (lice), and are therefore paraphyletic, as are Psocoptera as a whole.\n\nSome Troctomorpha, such as \"Liposcelis\" (which are similar to lice in morphology), are often found in birds' nests, and it is possible that a similar behavior in the ancestors of lice is at the origin of the parasitism seen today.\n\nPsocomorpha are notable for having antennae with 13 segments. They have two- or three-segmented tarsi, this condition being constant (e.g. Psocidae) or variable (e.g. Pseudocaeciliidae) within families. Their wing venation is variable, the most common type being that found in the genus \"Caecilius\" (rounded, free areola postica, thickened, free pterostigma, r+s two-branched, m three-branched). Additional veins are found in some families and genera (\"Dicropsocus\" and \"Goja\" in Epipsocidae, many Calopsocidae, etc.)\n\nPsocomorpha is the largest suborder of the Psocoptera \"sensu stricto\" (i.e. excluding Phthiraptera), with about 3,600 species in 24 families, ranging from the species-poor Bryopsocidae (2 spp.) to the speciose Psocidae (about 900 spp).\nPsocomorpha comprises Infraorder Epipsocetae (families Cladiopsocidae, Dolabellopsocidae, Epipsocidae, Neurostigmatidae and Ptiloneuridae), Infraorder Caeciliusetae (families Amphipsocidae, Asiopsocidae, Caeciliusidae, Dasydemellidae and Stenopsocidae), Infraorder Homilopsocidea (families Archipsocidae, Bryopsocidae, Calopsocidae, Ectopsocidae, Elipsocidae, Lachesillidae, Mesopsocidae, Peripsocidae, Philotarsidae, Pseudocaeciliidae and Trichopsocidae) and Infraorder Psocetae (families Hemipsocidae, Myopsocidae, Psilopsocidae and Psocidae).\n\n"}

{"id": "2154230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154230", "title": "Cooks Mills, Welland", "text": "Cooks Mills, Welland\n\nCooks Mills is a small community in the easternmost part of the city of Welland in Ontario, Canada. It was established, and is still centred, on a Welland River tributary called Lyons Creek. It is almost entirely a bedroom community, as there are few employers located in the area.\n\nThe community predates the establishment of what is now downtown Welland. In 1799, when present-day Welland was farmland, the Yokom family came from Pennsylvania and built a grist mill on Lyon's Creek. (Today, one of the roads in Cooks Mills is called Yokom Road after them.) Just before the War of 1812, an Englishman called Calvin Cook purchased the mill and added a tannery, a sawmill and a distillery. The place known as \"Cook's Mills\" became a prominent community of the Crowland Township; some early maps call the location Crowland Village.\n\nTowards the end of the War of 1812, a fire fight occurred at Cooks Mills, involving an American contingent sent to destroy flour and grain that might benefit the British. Early on the morning of October 19, 1814, the American picket at Misener's Hollow, just east of the mills, was attacked by soldiers of the Glengarry Light Infantry. The British force was supported by a 6-pound field cannon and Congreve rockets. The Americans succeeded in driving off the British, and threw the grain and flour into the mill pond.\n\nLyon's Creek headwaters were in the Wainfleet Marsh. However, they were cut off by the construction of the Feeder Canal for the Welland Canal. The creek was carried under the canal through a stone culvert. Due to the construction, the water level in the marsh slowly receded. All the while, the culvert was being clogged up by debris. Eventually, the flow in Lyons Creek decreased to the extent when it was no longer able to turn the water wheels at Cook's Mills. The industries were closed and abandoned. Thus, the canal, which contributed greatly to development of Welland, became an indirect cause of an economic recession for Cook's Mills. Later on, Welland beat neighbouring communities in the running for the county seat. Cook's Mills became a farming area as opposed to Welland's industrial centre.\n\nOver time, the apostrophes indicating the possessive in Lyon's Creek and Cook's Mills were dropped following a trend in the region exemplified by St. Catharines and St. Johns.\n\nOn January 1, 1961, the Crowland Township, including Cooks Mills, was incorporated into the City of Welland.\n\nBy the time of construction of the Welland By-Pass in 1967-1973, the original headwaters in the Wainfleet Marsh have all but disappeared, and most of what flow there was in the creek was coming from an earlier tributary called Indian Creek by some maps. This made Lyons Creek somewhat U-shaped, as Indian Creek flowed west before joining the original Lyons Creek. During the By-Pass construction, the creek was cut into three parts, and now what was once Indian Creek flows into the canal (photo). A couple kilometres north, Lyons Creek is fed directly from the canal (photo). The middle part of the creek dried up and much of its bed was torn up during the construction of approaches to the Townline Tunnel.\n\nIn a recent development, a study on the pollutants in the Niagara River done in 2000 found the organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to be present in the Lyons Creek. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment is investigating the source of PCBs and possible remedial actions to deal with contaminated sediment.\n\nThe Welland By-Pass channel separates Cooks Mills from the main urbanized area of City of Welland. The most direct ways of crossing the channel are the Main Street and Townline Tunnels.\n\nBuilt-up areas in Cooks Mills are located close to the roads; the rest of the area consists mainly of wooded lots and fields. The Niagara Road 27, commonly known as Schisler Road, linking Welland and Niagara Falls, runs to the north of the centre of the community, and Highway 140 runs to the west, while Montrose Road runs to the east, and Netherby Road runs to the south.\n\nThe main area of Welland is located to the west. To the east is Niagara Falls, to the north is Thorold, and to the south is Port Colborne.\n\n\n\n"}

The school mascot is a Panther and the school colors are royal blue and white.\n\nThe original 1926 McKinley High School building, now being used by Alumni Association as the \"McKinley High School Alumni Center\", was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1981.\n\nThe forerunner of McKinley Senior High, was named the Hickory Street School, which was located several blocks East of the present site, in 1907-1908. The school outgrew the building, so the school was renamed The Baton Rouge Colored High School and moved to a new location.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Colored High School was located at the corner of Perkins Road and Bynum Street in 1913. This facility was later struck by lightning and destroyed.\n\nMcKinley is the oldest high school established for African Americans in East Baton Rouge Parish. McKinley's first graduating class was in 1916. The four students became the first African American high school graduates in Louisiana.\n\nThe original McKinley High School building was constructed in 1926 and opened in 1927, and was named in honor of the 25th President of the United States. The school opened September 19, 1927 on Texas Street, currently name Thomas H. Delpit Drive.\nIn 1950 the High School was moved to a new facility at the corner of Louise Street and McCalop Street, next to the present day I-10. The Thomas H. Delpit Drive facility became McKinley Junior High School.\n\nIn 1962, the third and present day McKinley Senior High School was built on East McKinley Street, the Junior High School was moved to the I-10 site, and the Thomas H. Delpit Drive site became McKinley Elementary.\n\nThe original McKinley Senior High School facility on Thomas H. Delpit Dr. was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1981, and was subsequently purchased by the Alumni Association from the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board on February 5, 1992.\n\nOn January 14, 2016, President Barack Obama hosted a town hall at Mckinley High. This was the first time a sitting president hosted a town hall at a secondary school in Louisiana.\n\nThe current campus sits in Old South Baton Rouge just to the northwest of the Louisiana State University campus, and is bordered by Lake Crest, one of the LSU lakes to the East. Facilities include five main buildings, many out buildings, football and baseball fields, tennis courts, track and field facilities, and a new black box theater which was built by students in 2006.\n\nMcKinley serves sections of Baton Rouge and half of the Gardere census-designated place.\n\nMcKinley offers 23 Advanced Placement courses, and is one of Baton Rouge's two high schools with a Gifted and Talented program.\n\nAs of 2007 McKinley's high academics standards, it ranked among the best in the state. The students ranked 18th of all schools in Louisiana for the statewide average ACT score and 3rd in the state when comparing their Gifted and Talented program.\n\nMcKinley competes in the Louisiana High School Athletics Association (LHSAA) District 5 Class 5A. Their biggest rival is Scotlandville Magnet High School. They compete in the following sports:\n\nOn 17 April 2018 the LHSAA fined the school $2,500 and placed all its athletic programs on probation for two calendar years after sanctions related to multiple sports during the 2017–18 year. Four coaches had their Louisiana High School Coaches Association card privileges revoked for one year. The four programs involved were the girls junior varsity basketball, girls soccer, boys track and volleyball programs.\n\nAfter further investigation found more than 150 eligibility and rules compliance infractions the fine was increased to nearly $42,000, the entire 2017–2018 coaching staff (both faculty and non-faculty) was banned from coaching at any LHSAA school for one year, the school was given a two-year playoff ban for all sports, and the school forfeited runner-up finishes in Division I girls basketball for 2017 and 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

It is governed by a Board of Commissioners elected by the customer-owners, who, as owners, receive dividends (in the form of reduced rates) based on the income of the District.\n\nEstablished in 1936, the PUD began providing electric service in 1947. Today the PUD operates electric, water, and wastewater utilities. The electric portion of the utility includes electric generating stations and distribution facilities. Under its charter, the District is authorized to purchase electric energy; sell electric energy at wholesale and retail prices; acquire, construct and operate electric generating plants and transmission and distribution facilities; and issue revenue bonds for financing the acquisition and construction of electric properties, or for other corporate purposes.\n\nGenerating stations include three hydroelectric dams, as well as a limited amount of solar power. The District maintains diesel generators for use in emergencies. Distribution facilities include transmission lines, switchyards and ancillary equipment.\n\nChelan County PUD owns and operates the nation's second largest nonfederal, publicly owned hydroelectric generating system. Two of the District's hydropower stations, Rocky Reach Dam and Rock Island Dam, are part of an 11-dam system on the U.S. portion of the Columbia River, which is fed by the fourth largest drainage system in North America. Even during the driest years on record (1928 through 1932), the Columbia River's runoff was still 71 percent of normal. The District's third hydro project, Lake Chelan and Chelan River, serves a dual purpose of generating power and regulating the level of long Lake Chelan, the third deepest body of fresh water in North America.\n\nThe District's three hydroelectric generating projects have a combined total generating capacity of over 2,000 megawatts of hydropower, advantageous because of its low-cost, nonpolluting, and renewable nature. The three produce about 9 million megawatt-hours of power each year, enough to meet the needs of a city of more than 900,000.\n\n37 percent of the total generating capacity is needed to meet the needs of its Chelan County customers, including a portion of Alcoa's power-intensive Wenatchee aluminum smelter. The remaining 63 percent of the total generating capacity is mainly sold to four principal power purchasers: Puget Sound Energy, Avista Corporation, PacifiCorp, and Portland General Electric Company transmitted throughout the Pacific Northwest over a grid of high-voltage transmission lines. Chelan County residents and more than 7 million electric customers in the Pacific Northwest benefit from the low-cost electricity produced by the District. District residents, however, reaped the greatest rewards: The average residential electric rate in Chelan County is about 3 cents per kilowatt hour. By comparison, the national average residential rate is 8 cents per kilowatt hour, 267% more.\n\nChelan County PUD also offers water and wastewater services, as well as Washington state's largest open-access, fiber-to-the-premises fiber-optic network.\n\nChelan County PUD also owns a network of fourteen parks and recreation areas as part of its hydroelectric licensing guidelines, seven of which are maintained by the PUD Parks and Recreation Department, seven others are maintained by either a municipal or state government.\n\nIn the area around Chelan, the PUD owns and operates Chelan Falls Park, Chelan Falls Powerhouse Park, Chelan Riverwalk Park, and Beebe Bridge Park.\n\nIn the area around Wenatchee, the PUD owns and operates Wenatchee Riverfront Park, Walla Walla Point Park, and Rock Island Hydro Park (located just south of East Wenatchee in Douglas County).\n\nThe Apple Capital Recreation Loop Trail was constructed with funding from the PUD as part of dam mitigation and was completed in 1995.\n\n\n"}

Mohiuddin Chowdhury (1 December 1944 – 15 December 2017) was a Bangladesh Awami League politician. He served as the mayor of Chittagong, the second-largest city in Bangladesh. He had held the office for three consecutive terms.\n\nChowdhury was born on 1 December 1944 in Gohira village, Raozan upazila, Chittagong District, East Bengal, British Raj. His father was Hosen Ahmen Chowdhury, was a railway officer, and his mother was Bedowra Begum. After completing his SSC he joined Chittagong City College in 1962. He transferred the same year to Chittagong Polytechnic Institute. He was expelled from the institute for his involvement in student politics. He returned to Chittagong City College in 1965 and graduated in 1967. He started post graduate course at the University of Chittagong with a major in Islamic History and Culture. He dropped out before completing his master's degree.\n\nChowdhury was the general secretary of the Chittagong city unit of Chhatra League. He was leader of Sorbodolio Chhatra Sangram Parishad and organised a strike in Chittagong on 1 March 1971. After the 7 March 1971 speech by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Chowdhury and other student activists looted firearms from the Rifles Club and an arms depot in Majhirghat. He was arrested by the Pakistan Army soon but was released after he pretended to be insane in prison. He moved to India to train for the Mukti Bahini and was appointed a commander in the East Mount Battalion after his training. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, he formed a Mujib bahini unit to resist the Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad government. He was arrested by the government. he fled to India on being released.\n\nChowdhury was elected Mayor of chittagong in 1994. He was the first elected Mayor of Chittagong city. He beat the Mir Mohammed Nasiruddin, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidate and previous mayor who was appointed to his post, to win the election by 16 thousand votes. He won his second election in 2000 easily after the election was boycotted by Bangladesh Nationalist Party. In 2005 the Bangladesh Nationalist Party government gave its full support to Mir Mohammed Nasiruddin. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia campaigned for Nasiruddin. Tarique Zia lived and campaigned in Chittagong for a week. Chowdhury still was able to secure an election win. He became the President of Chittagong city Awami League in 2006. He was elected mayor three times. He served 17 years until his electoral defeat by Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidate M Manjurul Alam in 2010.\n\nDuring Chowdhury's term he established five maternity clinics. The hospital has specialized neonatal care and advanced gynaecological surgery facilities. The hospital is overseen by two consultant gynaecologists and a team of doctors.\n\nChowdhury was the first mayor in Bangladesh to establish a private university – Premier University, Chittagong, sponsored by the Chittagong City Corporation. After he took office, the corporation established nine postsecondary colleges, computer-training centres, a midwife training centre, a healthcare-technology training centre (the first in Bangladesh to train in the operation of health care technology including radiology and radiography) and eight night colleges to expand adult literacy. The Chittagong city authority also manages eight Hindu religious education centers (known as Sanskrit Toll) to provide religious education in Sanskrit to minority students.\n\nAfter the army-backed government assumed power in Bangladesh in January 2007, Mohiuddin and other politicians in the country were arrested in an overnight raid on 7 March. He was incarcerated (mostly incommunicado) in various prisons in the country. When first arrested, unlike other arrested leaders he was taken to a remote jail in Bandarban (a district of Chittagong Hill Tracts).\n\nWhilst in prison, Chowdhury's daughter was diagnosed with blood cancer in Thailand. He was detained without trial for 21 months, the government did not release him from prison to see his dying daughter. He was finally released from prison on 8 October 2008 following a High Court order. Despite his release, the army-backed government retained his passport and did not allow him to fly to Thailand in time to see his daughter. On 17 October, when the government finally permitted him to fly abroad and just minutes before he boarded the aircraft en route to Bangkok, Chowdhury's daughter died.\n\nChowdhury died at 3:00 am on 15 December 2017. He was buried in his family graveyard at Chashma Hill with an honor guard performed by Bangladesh Police.\n"}

She began writing at an early age and earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst. During this time she was involved with the university's theater department as a performer.\n\nWhile attending Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida for theatre, Oliver met director and screenwriter Alan Ball in 1976. Together they founded the General Nonsense Theater Company, a satirical ensemble for which the two wrote, staged and starred in subversive comical sketches. She was also a member of Alarm Dog Rep. A playwright whose work includes \"Office\", \"Dreams Are Funny\", \"Calypso\" and \"VW\" as well as several plays for young people, she twice won Florida's Individual Artist Grant for Playwriting. In addition to working previously as a teacher, columnist and newspaper editor, she studied Drama at the Banff Fine Arts Center in Canada and Trinity College, Oxford. She earned a Master of Arts degree in Acting and Directing from Florida State University.\n\nAfter graduating, Oliver supported herself by doing \"anything anyone would pay me to do that was kind of mindless—typing, filing, Xeroxing—so I could save the rest for writing and directing.\" She moved to Los Angeles in 1997 after the computer game she was writing for, \"Riana Rouge\", relocated to the West Coast. She later teamed up again with Alan Ball, becoming his script reader. A few years later, shortly after deciding to abandon show business and move back to Florida, Ball offered her a spot as a writer and co-producer for the award-winning television series \"Six Feet Under\". Oliver began as a writer during the show's third season and stayed on for three years.\n\nThe idea for her first screenplay, which would eventually be made into the 2007 film \"Lars and the Real Girl\", was the result of an early job in which she dealt \"with a lot of Web sites and a lot of lonely guys.\" Oliver considers the story, in which a lonely and delusional 27-year-old man forms a romantic attachment to a sex doll, a \"contemporary fairy tale\". After contemplating the concept for nearly five years, Oliver wrote the script over a nine-month period in 2002, before she was hired at \"Six Feet Under\". In 2002, when her agent asked for a project to shop around, Oliver gave them \"Lars\". In 2005, it was ranked No. 3 on the 2005 edition of The Black List, a compilation of the Top 90 most-liked, un-produced scripts in Hollywood.\n\nDirected by Craig Gillespie and starring Ryan Gosling, the film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival where it received a standing ovation from the audience. The screenplay was eventually nominated for several awards, including an Academy Award for Original Screenplay. In 2008, Oliver received the Humanitas Prize for the screenplay.\n\nIn 2007, Oliver again teamed up with Alan Ball to write and direct episodes for his HBO vampire series, \"True Blood\".

The duo recorded the album at hip hop producer Marley Marl's home studio and Power Play Studios in New York City, following Rakim's response to Eric B.'s search for a rapper to complement his disc jockey work in 1985. The album peaked at number fifty-eight on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and produced five singles: \"Eric B. Is President\", \"I Ain't No Joke\", \"I Know You Got Soul\", \"Move the Crowd\", and \"Paid in Full\".\n\n\"Paid in Full\" is credited as a benchmark album of golden age hip hop. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered the use of internal rhymes in hip hop, set a higher standard of lyricism in the genre and served as a template for future rappers. The album's heavy sampling by Eric B. became influential in hip hop production. The record has sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it platinum in 1995. In 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 228 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nEric B. and Rakim met in 1985 after Eric B. looked for a rapper to complement his turntable work at the New York City radio station WBLS. After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for \"New York's top MC\", Eric B.'s friend and roommate Marley Marl allowed him to use his home studio. The first track they recorded, \"Eric B. Is President\", was released as a single on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons heard the single, the duo were signed to Island Records and began recording the album in Manhattan's Power Play Studios in early 1987. Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, \"When I hear my first album today I hear myself reading my rhymes but I'm my worst critic.\" The duo completed the album in one week. They have said that they worked in 48-hour shifts and recorded in single takes to complete the album within budget. In a 2008 interview with AllHipHop, Eric B. stated, \"[T]o sit here and say we put together this calculated album to be a great album would be a lie. We were just doing records that felt good.\"\n\nThe album's success led to a contract with Uni Records and MCA Records, where they released their second album, \"Follow the Leader\" (1988). Eric B. and Rakim are credited as officially producing \"Paid in Full\". Although Marley Marl claimed to have produced two tracks (\"My Melody\" and \"Eric B. Is President\"), Eric B. has argued that Marley Marl was only an engineer. In 2003, Eric B. alleged the duo had not been fully paid for their work, and filed a lawsuit against the Island Def Jam Music Group, Lyor Cohen, and Russell Simmons.\n\nThe album cover featured a photo of Eric B. and Rakim wearing custom-made Gucci \"knock-ups\" by Harlem tailor Dapper Dan.\n\nRakim's rhyming deviated from the simple rhyme patterns of early 1980s hip hop. His free-rhythm style ignored bar lines and had earned comparisons to Thelonious Monk. \"The New York Times\" Ben Ratliff wrote that Rakim's \"unblustery rapping developed the form beyond the flat-footed rhythms of schoolyard rhymes\". While many rappers developed their technique through improvisation, Rakim was one of the first to demonstrate advantages of a writerly style, as with for instance his pioneering use of internal rhyme. Unlike previous rappers such as LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C. who delivered their vocals with high energy, Rakim employed a relaxed, stoic delivery. According to MTV, \"We'd been used to MCs like Run and DMC, Chuck D and KRS-One leaping on the mic shouting with energy and irreverence, but Rakim took a methodical approach to his microphone fiending. He had a slow flow, and every line was blunt, mesmeric.\" Rakim's relaxed delivery resulted from his jazz influences; he had played the saxophone and was a John Coltrane fan. His subject matter often covered his own rapping skills and lyrical superiority over other rappers.\n\nAllMusic editor Steve Huey characterized Rakim for his \"complex internal rhymes, literate imagery, velvet-smooth flow, and unpredictable, off-the-beat rhythms.\" \"Pitchfork\" writer Jess Harvell described his rapping as \"authoritative, burnished, [and] possessing an unflappable sense of rhythm\". \"Paid in Full\", which contains gritty, heavy, and dark beats, marked the beginning of heavy sampling in hip hop records. Of the album's ten tracks, three are instrumentals. As a disc jockey, Eric B. had reinstated the art of live turntable mixing. His soul-filled sampling became influential in future hip hop production. Music critic Robert Christgau noted that Eric B. had incorporated \"touches of horn or whistle deep in the mix\" of his sampled percussion and scratches.\n\n\"Eric B. Is President\" was released as the first single with \"My Melody\" as the B-side. It peaked at number 48 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number forty on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. The track sparked debate on the legality of unauthorized sampling when James Brown sued to prevent the duo's use of his music. PopMatters' Mark Anthony Neal called it \"the most danceable hip-hop recording\" of 1986. According to Touré of \"The New York Times\", \"It is Rakim's verbal dexterity as well as his calm, deep voice and dark tone that has made this song a rap classic: 'I came in the door/ I said it before/ I'll never let the mic magnetize me no more/ But it's bitin' me/ Fightin' me/ Invitin' me to rhyme/ I can't hold it back/ I'm looking for the line/ Takin' off my coat/ Clearin' my throat/ The rhyme will be kickin' it/ Til I hit my last note.'\" The second single, \"I Ain't No Joke\", peaked at number 38 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Described as one of the album's \"monumental singles\", Michael Di Bella wrote in the \"All Music Guide to Rock\" that \"Rakim grabs the listener by the throat and illustrates his mastery of the rhyming craft\".\n\nThe third single, \"I Know You Got Soul\", peaked at number 39 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, number 34 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, and number 64 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. The track's production contains \"digitized cymbal crashes, breathing sounds, and a bumping bass line.\" The song popularized James Brown samples in hip hop songs. The British band <nowiki>M|A|R|R|S</nowiki> sampled the line, \"Pump up the volume\", on their number one UK single, \"Pump Up the Volume\". \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it at number 386 on \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The fourth single, \"Move the Crowd\", peaked at number three on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and number 25 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. The track's B-side, \"Paid in Full\", was released as a single in 1987 and later remixed by the production duo Coldcut. The remix used several vocal samples, most prominently \"Im Nin'Alu\" by Israeli singer Ofra Haza. In 2008, the song was ranked at number 24 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs\".\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"The Washington Post\", Mark Jenkins highlighted the single \"Eric B. Is President\" but was unimpressed by the rest of \"Paid in Full\": \"Its beats are monotonous, and the attempts to take 'jazz and the quiet storm' and 'convert into hip-hop form' fall flat.\" Robert Christgau from \"The Village Voice\" said it has \"four groundbreaking masterworks\" in \"I Ain't No Joke\", \"I Know You Got Soul\", \"Paid in Full\", and \"Eric B. Is President\", but was less enthusiastic about the other six songs: \"They're pure, innovative, in-your-face—no doubt. But they're also turntablism with spoken decoration, of small use to anyone who hasn't internalized the 'real' hip hop aesthetic.\" In the newspaper's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll, it was named the 27th best album of 1987.\n\n\"Paid in Full\" was released during what became known as the golden age hip hop era. In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), Sasha Frere-Jones called it \"one of hip-hop's perfect records\", while Alex Ogg considered it to be the duo's magnum opus in his book \"The Men Behind Def Jam\". Rakim's rapping on the album set a blueprint for future rappers and helped secure East Coast hip hop's reputation for innovative lyrical technique. Author William Cobb stated in \"To the Break of Dawn\" that his rapping had \"stepped outside\" of the preceding era of old school hip hop and that while the vocabulary and lyrical dexterity of newer rappers had improved, it was \"nowhere near what Rakim introduced to the genre\". \"The New York Times\" Dimitri Ehrlich, who described the album as \"an artistic and commercial benchmark\", credited Rakim for helping \"give birth to a musical genre\" and leading \"a quiet musical revolution, introducing a soft-spoken rapping style\". Allmusic's Steve Huey declared \"Paid in Full\" one of hip-hop's most influential albums and \"essential listening\" for those interested in the genre's \"basic musical foundations\". MTV ranked it at number one in \"The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time\", stating it raised the standards of hip-hop \"both sonically and poetically\" and described it as \"captivating, profound, innovative and instantly influential\".

Jess Harvell of \"Pitchfork\" complimented Rakim for an \"endless display of pure skill\" and described the album as \"laidback and funky\", but believed it contained \"too much filler to get a free 'classic' pass\". \"Pitchfork\" placed \"Paid in Full\" at number fifty-two in its \"Top 100 Albums of the 1980s\"; editor Sam Chennault wrote that Rakim inspired a generation of MCs and \"defined what it meant to be a hip-hop lyricist\". Slant Magazine listed the album at #32 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\" saying \"For his part, Rakim didn't need to rely on macho jargon and trite gangsterisms for his self-aggrandizing sermons; he would simply reel off line after line of spellbinding wordplay, influencing an entire decade of tongue-twisting MCs in the process.\"\n\nRakim is credited with influencing rappers including the Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Nas, who cited \"Paid in Full\" as one of his favorite albums. 50 Cent told \"NME\" that \"Paid in Full\" was the first album he bought: \"I used to get my grandmother's tape recorder – the one she used to tape church services – and record hip-hop off the radio. And, with Eric B. & Rakim, I think that was the first moment where I felt like, 'I've got to own this. This is crucial.'\"\n\nOn July 11, 1995, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum.

Kawamura's wife Haru was the aunt of Saigō Takamori.\n\nA native of Satsuma, Kawamura studied navigation at Tokugawa bakufu naval school at Nagasaki, the Nagasaki Naval Training Center. In 1868, he joined his Satsuma clansmen, and fought on the imperial side in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration as an army general. He was especially noted for his role in the Battle of Aizu-Wakamatsu.\n\nUnder the new Meiji government, he became an officer in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy, and steadily rose through the ranks. He became first Director of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1870 and \"taifu\" (senior vice minister) of Navy in 1872. He was in command of Japanese naval forces during the Taiwan Expedition of 1874.\n\nDuring the Satsuma Rebellion, he was placed in command of all Imperial troops in September 1877 at the final Battle of Shiroyama near Kumamoto, when Saigō Takamori was killed (or committed \"seppuku\"). This battle, Saigō's last stand against the Meiji government, was the historical basis for the 2003 film \"The Last Samurai\".\n\nIn 1878, Kawamura became \"sangi\" (councillor) and the second Navy Minister. He remained in that position until 1885 except when he was temporarily replaced by Enomoto Takeaki, and during that period he expanded the influence of people from Satsuma within the navy.\n\nIn 1884, he was ennobled with the title of \"hakushaku\" (count) under the \"kazoku\" peerage system. Later serving as court councillor and Privy Councillor, in 1901 he was given responsibility for the upbringing of the newborn Prince Michi (the future Emperor Hirohito) and his younger brother Prince Chichibu (Yasuhito).\n\nIn 1904, Kawamura was posthumously appointed to the rank of admiral, setting a precedent for such honors.

It received a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year.\n\nOriginally, another song was to be released as the second single, \"For the Love of You\", but Arista Records decided to release \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\" instead because all Houston's singles had to be original material at this point of her career.\n\nThe single was number one for two weeks on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. A live performance from her September 2, 1987 concert in Saratoga Springs, New York was used as the official video and played on MTV, VH1, and BET. The recorded performance was also televised along with her performance of \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards on September 11. It was widely speculated that the song is about Houston's relationship with then NFL star Randall Cunningham.\n\nAbout.com ranked the song at number 7 in their list of \"Top 20 Best Whitney Houston Songs\", noting it as \"a big, emotional production that pulls out all of the stops vocally\". Rob Wynn of AllMusic highlighted the song. \"Los Angeles Times\" editor Robert Hilburn wrote, \"Houston's stardom will be boosted most by \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", a sweeping Masser-Will Jennings ballad with the kind of big, emotional finish that will make Liza and hundreds of other singers wish they had been given first crack at the song.

The song also topped both component charts, the Hot 100 Singles Sales and Hot 100 Airplay, Houston's fourth song (and fourth consecutive release) to do so. The single stayed in the Top 40 for 13 weeks, and topped the Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks.

{"id": "2154325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154325", "title": "Cannabis indica", "text": "Cannabis indica\n\nCannabis indica is an annual plant in the family Cannabaceae. It is a putative species of the genus \"Cannabis\". Whether it and \"Cannabis sativa\" are truly separate species is a matter of debate. The \"Cannabis indica\" plant is cultivated for many purposes; for example, the plant fibers can be converted into cloth. \"Cannabis indica\" produces large amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The higher concentrations of THC provide euphoric and intoxicating effects making it popular for use both as a recreational and medicinal drug.\n\nIn 1785, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a description of a second species of \"Cannabis\", which he named \"Cannabis indica\". Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. Richard Evans Schultes described \"C. indica\" as relatively short, conical, and densely branched, whereas \"C. sativa\" was described as tall and laxly branched. Loran C. Anderson described \"C. indica\" plants as having short, broad leaflets whereas those of \"C. sativa\" were characterized as relatively long and narrow. \"Cannabis indica\" plants conforming to Schultes's and Anderson's descriptions originated from the Hindu Kush mountain range. Because of the often harsh and variable (extremely cold winters, and warm summers) climate of those parts, \"C. indica\" is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates.\n\nBroad-leafed \"Cannabis indica\" plants in the Indian Subcontinent are traditionally cultivated for the production of charas, a form of hashish. Pharmacologically, \"C. indica\" landraces tend to have a less THC content than \"C. sativa\" strains Some users report more of a \"stoned\" feeling and less of a \"high\" from \"C. indica\" when compared to \"C. sativa\". (The terms \"sativa\" and \"indica\", used in this sense, are more appropriately termed \"narrow-leaflet\" drug type and \"wide-leaflet\" drug type \"Cannabis indica\" (or \"Cannabis sativa\" subsp. \"indica\" depending on the monotypic or polytipic point of view), respectively.) The \"Cannabis indica\" high is often referred to as a \"body buzz\" and has beneficial properties such as pain relief in addition to being an effective treatment for insomnia and an anxiolytic, as opposed to \"sativa\"'s more common reports of a cerebral, creative and energetic high, and even, albeit rarely, comprising hallucinations. Differences in the terpenoid content of the essential oil may account for some of these differences in effect. Common \"indica\" strains for recreational or medicinal use include Kush and Northern Lights.\n\nA recent genetic analysis included both the narrow-leaflet and wide-leaflet drug \"biotypes\" under \"C. indica\", as well as southern and eastern Asian hemp (fiber/seed) landraces and wild Himalayan populations.\n\nThere are several key differences between \"Cannabis indica\" and \"Cannabis sativa\". These include height and stature, internodal length, leaf size and structure, buds size and density, flowering time, odour, smoke and effects. \"Indica\" plants tend to grow shorter and bushier than the sativa plants. Indica strains tend to have wide, short leaves with short wide blades, whereas sativa strains have long leaves with thin long blades. The buds of indica strains tend to be wide, dense and bulky, while sativa strains are likely to be long, sausage shaped flowers.\n\nOn average, \"Cannabis indica\" has higher levels of THC compared to CBD, whereas \"Cannabis sativa\" has lower levels of THC to CBD. However, huge variability exists within either species. A 2015 study shows the average THC content of the most popular herbal cannabis products in the Netherlands has decreased slightly since 2005.\n\nIn the recent era of cannabis breeding higher-ratio CBD strains are being developed from Indica origins that may test out as 1:1 (CBD-THC balanced) or even as high as a 22:1 (CBD dominant). The medical interests in Cannabis are taking this further and we will see increasing cultivation trends for more strains developed with CBD-dominant ratios. In California, cities such as Coachella and Desert Hot Springs are re-zoning areas for cannabis cultivation. Even though Californians legalized recreational use of cannabis in late 2016, the LA Times, prior to the vote, reported an entrepreneurial focus on CBD-dominant medical hemp crops, \"The demand for medical products was so high, this [ cultivation expansion] was just to fill the need for that.\" Low anxiety and hallucinogenic properties (psychoactive effects of THC reduced by CBD) make these \"high-CBD strains\" very desirable for chronic treatment programs.\n\nThere are three chemotaxonomic types of \"Cannabis\": one with high levels of THC, one which is more fibrous and has higher levels of CBD, and one that is an intermediate between the two.\n\nCannabis strains with CBD:THC ratios above 5:2 are likely to be more relaxing and produce less anxiety than vice versa. This may be due to CBD's antagonistic effects at the cannabinoid receptors, compared to THC's partial agonist effect. CBD is also a 5-HT receptor (serotonin) agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic-content effect. The effects of \"sativa\" are well known for its cerebral high. Users can expect a more vivid and uplifting high, while \"indica\" is well known for its sedative effects which some prefer for night time use. Indica possesses a more calming, soothing, and numbing experience in which can be used to relax or relieve pain. Both types are used as medical cannabis.\n\nDuring the 1970s, \"Cannabis indica\" strains from Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan particularly from the Hindu Kush mountain range were brought to the United States, where the first hybrids with \"Cannabis sativa\" plants from equatorial areas were developed, widely spreading marijuana cultivation throughout the States.\n\nPlants with elevated levels of propyl cannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), have been found in populations of Cannabis indica from India, Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as southern and western Africa. THCV levels up to 53.7% of total cannabinoids have been reported\n\nThe name \"indica\" originally referred to the geographical area in which the plant was grown. Whether \"C. sativa\" and \"C. indica\" are separate species is still a matter of debate. However, investigation into chemotaxonomic differences support a two-species hypothesis.\n\nIn 2011, a team of Canadian researchers led by Andrew Sud announced that they had sequenced a draft genome of the Purple Kush variety of \"C. indica\".\n\n\n"}

The name Goitein points probably to Kojetín in Moravia as the city of origin of the family. He was brought up with both secular and Talmudic education. In 1914 his father died and the family moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he finished high school and university.\n\nDuring 1918–23 he studied Arabic and Islam at the University of Frankfurt under the guidance of the famous scholar Josef Horovitz, while continuing his Talmudic study with a private teacher. He left the university with a dissertation on prayer in Islam. In the year 1923, Goitein fulfilled his lifelong dream and immigrated together with Gershom Scholem sailing to Palestine, where he stayed for thirty-four years. He lived four years in Haifa until he was invited to lecture at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been inaugurated two years earlier. In Jerusalem, he married Theresa Gottlieb (1900–1987), a eurhythmics teacher who composed songs and plays for children. They had three children, Ayala, Ofra, and Elon.\n\nIn 1957 he moved to the United States where he felt more able to remain focused on his studies. He settled in Philadelphia and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He died on February 6, 1985, the day his last volume of the series \"A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza\" (vol. 5) was sent to the publisher.\n\nIn 1918–23, Goitein attended the universities of Frankfurt and Berlin and studied Islamic history under Josef Horovitz. His Ph.D. thesis was \"on prayer in Islam.\" He also pursued Jewish studies, and was a leader in the Zionist Youth Movement. In 1923 he immigrated to Palestine, where he taught Bible and Hebrew language at the Reali School in Haifa. In 1927 he wrote a play called \"Pulcellina\" about the blood libel killings in Blois in 1171. In 1928, he was appointed professor of Islamic History and Islamic Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was founder of the School of Asian and African studies and of the Israel Oriental Society. In 1928, he began his research of the language, culture and history of the Jews of Yemen. In 1949, he did research in Aden, questioning the Jews who gathered there from all parts of Yemen before being flown to Israel. In 1938-1948, he served as a senior education officer in Mandatory Palestine, responsible for Jewish and Arab Schools, and published books on methods of teaching the Bible and Hebrew.\n\nFrom 1948, Goitein began his life's work on the Cairo Geniza documents. An especially rich geniza with a large volume of correspondence was discovered in Old Cairo containing thousands of documents dating from the 9th to the 13th centuries. Since Jews began every letter or document with the words \"With the help of God,\" the papers reflected all aspects of everyday life in the countries of North Africa and bordering the Mediterranean. The documents included many letters from Jewish traders \"en route\" from Tunisia and Egypt to Yemen and ultimately to India. The papers were mostly written in Judeo-Arabic characters. After deciphering the documents, Goitein vividly reconstructed many aspects of Jewish life in the Middle Ages, publishing them in a six-volume monumental series, \"A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza\" (1967–1993). Although the documents were written by Jews, they reflect the surrounding Moslem and Christian environments not only in countries bordering the Mediterranean but all the way to India. This has thrown new light on the whole study of the Middle Ages.\n\nGoitein's lengthy correspondence with the Nobel Prize-winning author S.Y. Agnon was published by his daughter, Ayala Gordon, in 2008. Agnon's wife, Esther, had studied Arabic privately with Goitein while she was a student at the University of Frankfurt. When Goitein moved to Jerusalem, he and Agnon became close friends. Most of the letters are from the mid-1950s onwards, after Goitein left Israel, a move of which Agnon was highly critical.\n\nGoitein was awarded honorary degrees from many universities. He received research awards from Guggenheim (1965), Harvey (1980), and the MacArthur lifetime fellowship (1983).\n\nHe received the National Jewish Book Award Scholarship for \"A Mediterranean Society Vol. IV\" in 1984.\n\n\nTwo editions of his bibliographies are available:<br>\n1.

Originally known as the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church, the United Church merged with other Lutheran groups to form the American Lutheran Church in 1960, which endured until 1988.\n\nThe Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association in America (or Blair Church) was formed in 1884 by a group of Danish members who left the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Many of Blair Church pastors were supportive of the Inner Mission. The Blair Church was based in Blair, Nebraska.\n\nThe Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (or North Church) was formed in 1894 when seminary president Kristian Anker and professor Peter Sørensen Vig, along with a number of pastor and congregations, left the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America over theological differences. These two churches merged in 1896 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to form the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church (in addition to being known as the United Church, this new church continued to be referred to as the \"Blair Church\").\n\nThe United Church quickly formed a system of education, centered in Blair, Nebraska. The center-piece was Trinity Seminary, an institution designed for the training of pastors. Trinity was supported by the Dana School. The Dana School was originally intended to provide future pastors with a pre-seminary education, and others in the community with a secondary education. The school eventually became a two-year college, and then a four-year college, now known as Dana College.\n\nIn 1946, as the second and third generation of Danes in America started to merge into the American culture, the word \"Danish\" was dropped from the official name of the church. In 1960, the United Church merged with churches that were ethnically German and Norwegian to form the American Lutheran Church. In 1959, just before its merger into the ALC, the United Church had 197 pastors, 164 congregations, and 66,623 members.\n\nIn 1988, the American Lutheran Church became a part of the largest Lutheran denomination in America, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. As a result of the merger, Trinity Seminary closed its doors, becoming a part of Wartburg Theological Seminary. Dana College in Blair continued to be a college of the ELCA until its closure in 2010.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Lutherans in Denmark were divided into three different camps. Many in the church followed the ideas of the theologian and hymn writer N. F. S. Grundtvig. Another group, known as Inner Mission, was strongly influenced by European Pietism. This group was so opposed to the ideas of Grundtvig that they were often referred to as the \"Anti-Grundtvigians\". Finally, a third group known as the Centerists attempted to keep the church together by incorporating ideas from both groups.\n\nThe United Church fell firmly in the Inner Mission or Anti-Grundtvigian camp. There was a strong emphasis on personal holiness in the United Church, and not much talk about the sacraments. This emphasis led to the United Church being known as the \"sad Danes\" or \"holy Danes\". While other Danish Lutherans in America tended to prefer pastors and leaders trained in Copenhagen, the United Church more quickly moved toward pastors trained in America in order to avoid the influence of Grundtvigian theology.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many scholars accept \"Cannabis ruderalis\" as its own species due to its unique traits and phenotypes which distinguish it from \"Cannabis indica\" and \"Cannabis sativa\"; however, it is widely debated by many other scholars as to whether or not \"ruderalis\" is a subspecies of \"Cannabis sativa\".\n\n\"Cannabis ruderalis\" was first described by Russian botanist D. E. Janischewsky in 1924. The term \"ruderalis\" is derived from the Latin \"rūdera\", which is the plural form of \"rūdus\", a Latin word meaning rubble, lump, or rough piece of bronze. A ruderal species refers to any plant that is the first to colonize land after a disturbance removing competition.\n\nIt is widely accepted \"C. ruderalis\" is its own species, rather than a subspecies from \"C. sativa\". \"C. ruderalis\" as classified in 1924 by D. E. Janischewsky, noting the visible differences in seed, shape and size from previously classified \"Cannabis sativa\". \"ruderalis\" represent feral types of \"cannabis\" which have higher CBD levels and a more cerebral effect, this combined with the high delta9-thc levels from the \"C. sativa\" gives the most potent strains , \"c. ruderalis\" occupies regions farther north in latitude. Chemotaxanomic analysis reveals that \"C. ruderalis\" is shown to have lower THC levels to the feral biotype of \"C. sativa\".\n\n\"Cannabis ruderalis\" is smaller than other species of \"Cannabis\". \"C. ruderalis\" rarely grows over two feet in height. Plants have \"thin, slightly fibrous stems\" with little branching. Foliage is typically open with large leaves, \"C. ruderalis\" reaches maturity much quicker than other species of \"Cannabis,\" typically in a five to seven week period from seed.\n\nUnlike other species of cannabis, \"Cannabis ruderalis\" enters the flowering stage based on the maturity of the plant, rather than its light cycle. With \"C. sativa\" and \"C. indica\" varieties, it is possible to keep the plant in the vegetative state indefinitely by maintaining a long daylight cycle. \"C. ruderalis\", however, will enter the flowering stage regardless of daily light duration. \"Cannabis\" geneticists today refer to this feature as \"\"auto-flowering\"\". \n\nIt has less THC in its resin compared to other Cannabis species. However, it is often high in cannabidiol (CBD).\n\n\"Cannabis ruderalis\" was first scientifically identified in 1924 in southern Siberia, although it also grows wild in other areas of Russia. The Russian botanist, Janischewski, was studying wild \"Cannabis\" in the Volga River system and realized he had come upon a third species. \"C. ruderalis\" is a hardier variety grown in the northern Himalayas and southern states of the former Soviet Union, characterized by a more sparse, \"weedy\" growth.\n\nSimilar \"C. ruderalis\" populations can be found in most of the areas where hemp cultivation was once prevalent. The most notable region in North America is the midwestern United States, though populations occur sporadically throughout the United States and Canada. Large wild \"C. ruderalis\" populations are also found in central and eastern Europe, most of them in Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and adjacent countries. Without human selection, these plants have lost many of the traits they were originally selected for, and have acclimated to their environment.\n\nSeeds of \"C. ruderalis\" were brought to Amsterdam in the early 1980s in order to enhance the breeding program of the Seed Bank.\n\n\"Cannabis ruderalis\" has a lower THC content than either \"C. sativa\" or \"C. indica\", so it is rarely grown for recreational use and the shorter stature of \"C. ruderalis\" limits its application for hemp production. \"Cannabis ruderalis\" strains are high in the cannabіnoid cannabidiol (CBD), so they are grown by some medical marijuana users.\n\nHowever, \"C. ruderalis\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> early, plant-age triggered \"autoflowering\" characteristic (which offers some agricultural advantages over the photoperiodic flowering varieties) as well as its reputed resistance to insect and disease pressures makes it attractive to plant breeders. \"C. indica\" strains are frequently cross-bred with \"C. ruderalis\" to produce autoflowering plants with high THC content, improved hardiness and reduced height. One strain, identified in 1960, is \"Cannabis x intersita\" Sojak which is a cross between \"C. sativa\" and \"C. ruderalis\". Attempts to produce a \"Cannabis\" strain with a shorter growing season are another application of cultivating \"C. ruderalis\". \"C. ruderalis\" when crossed with \"sativa\" and \"indica\" strains produces a plant which flowers automatically and is fully mature in 10 weeks.\n\nBecause \"C. ruderalis\" transitions from the vegetative stage to the flowering stage with age, as opposed to the light cycle required with photoperiod strains, it is bred with other household \"sativa\" and \"indica\" strains of \"cannabis\" to create \"Auto-flowering cannabis strains\". These strains are favorable for cultivars because they exhibit the hardiness of \"ruderalis\" plants while still maintaining the medicinal effects of \"sativa\" and \"indica\" strains. The Auto-flowering trait is extremely beneficial because it allows for multiple harvests in one outdoor growing season without the use of light deprivation techniques necessary for multiple harvest of photo-period strains. As a result of \"ruderalis\" genetics, auto-flowering plants typically have much higher CBD levels than photo-period \"cannabis\".\n\n\"Cannabis ruderalis\" is traditionally used in Russian and Mongolian folk medicine, especially for uses in treating depression. Because \"C. ruderalis\" is among the lowest THC producing biotypes of \"Cannabis\", \"C. ruderalis\" is rarely used for recreational purposes.\n\nIn modern use, \"C. ruderalis\" has been crossed with Bedrocan strains to produce the strain Bediol for patients with medical prescriptions. \"C. sativa\" and \"C. indica\" strains bred with \"ruderalis\" plants typically exhibit the \"autoflowering\" phenotype exhibited by the \"C. ruderalis\" lineage, meaning that they flower when the plant reaches a certain maturity (usually ten weeks from seed) as opposed to flowering in accordance with the daily light schedules. In addition to this, due to the typically higher concentration of cannabidiol (CBD), \"ruderalis\" plants are valuable for patients looking to treat anxiety or epilepsy. \"C. ruderalis\" is also being used as a form of cancer treatment as well as sclerosis and loss of appetite.\n\n\n"}
