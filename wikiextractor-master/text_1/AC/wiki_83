According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located in the southern part of the province, from Manila, east from Lucena, to Camarines Norte, 3 nautical kilometers to Alabat Island.\n\nLopez is one of the largest municipalities in the province and has a total land area of 395.1 square kilometers representing 4.53% of the total land area of the province of Quezon.\n\nThe terrain generally ranges from above sea level with rugged mountain areas. Coastal areas deviate from plain to hilly terrains. Rivers, streams and springs abound throughout the municipality, but the most prominent is the Talolong River.\n\nIt is bordered by the municipalities of Catanauan and General Luna on the south, Macalelon on the south-west, Calauag on the north-east, Gumaca on the west, Buenavista and Guinayangan on the east.\n\nLopez is politically subdivided into 95 barangays, 7 of which are urban and 88 are rural.\n\nThere was a flourishing coastal settlement somewhere in the southern part of the municipality of Gumaca called Talolong. The settlement's name was derived from the name of the river that traverses the place.\n\nThe original location of the settlement was in the marshy mouth of a sedate river, which was founded by the descendants of Datu Dumangsil and Datu Balinsusa of the Kalilayan kingdom. Due to the frequent plundering and terrorism of the pirates, the colony was transferred to the present town's location.\n\nThe settlement of Lakan Bugtali who founded the community of Gumaca was gone. Even a trace of its remains cannot be identified neither the vintages of the encomienda of Kalilayan nor a fraction of its 16th century glories. When it became a sitio through a papal bull, the village started to manage by her own.\n\nIn 1756, some people from the town of Mayoboc (present-day Pitogo) sought refuge in the sitio as they fled the Moro raid that burned the town to the ground. After sometime, some of them become discontented with the affairs of governing the sitio, went back to the original site of Mayoboc and again formed a settlement on an uphill portion, more suitable to guard against the Moro pirates. It later came to be known as Pitogo.\n\nAs the sitio became more organized and seen an increase in population, it formally became a full pledged town, separated from Gumaca, in June 30, 1857, during the Governorship of Alcalde Mayor Don Candido Lopez y Diaz. It later came to be known as the town of Lopez.\n\nSettlement areas in the municipality are highly scattered; population concentration is noticeable only within the poblacion, that is, the urban barangays of Burgos, Danlagan, Gomez, Magsaysay, Rizal, San Lorenzo Ruiz (Bocboc) and Talolong as well as the rural barangays of Mal-ay, Sugod, Pansol, Calantipayan, Manguisian, Del Pilar, Bebito, Canda Ibaba and Canda Ilaya which are traversed by the national highway. The rest of rural barangays are reached by other road networks which are accessible during dry and wet season. According to the 2007 census, it had a population of 86,660, a quarter of which are in the urban areas and the rest are in the rural areas. Males outnumbered the females at a ratio of 105.34 to 100. The population grew to 95,167 in the 2015 census.\n\n\nLopez had a labor force of 56.99% in 2000 or 44,849. About 9,474 of the employed labor force were engaged in primary industries such as farming and fishing. Its economy is basically engaged in agriculture, crops, poultry and livestock production. Around 17,778.57 has. representing 45% of the total land area planted to coconut trees, 2,300 has. are established to rice production, 628 has. to corn harvest. Growing around are natural materials for handicraft such as wild vines, buri, anahaw, tikiw, bamboo, cogon and talahib. Several cottage industries exist in the locality such as bamboo furniture, bolo, baskets, rattan, anahaw and buri fan making, buntal and tikiw. It also has rich fishing grounds in the Lopez Bay area and a number of inland fishponds. Fish, shrimps, prawns, crabs and other sea products are abundant.\n\nRice is also a major staple crop, the municipality is also a major banana producer in the region. Other crops grown in the municipality are citrus, root crops, vegetables and industrial crops. Majority of the farmers are also raising livestock and poultry.\n\nElected municipal officials 2016–2019:\n\n\n\n\nLopez Sports Centre is noted for its cockfighting which is held every Sunday. In 2009 it was visited by Charley Boorman as part of \"\".\n\nLopez is dubbed as the educational center of Southern Quezon. Several educational institutions operate in the town serving not only its citizens but also those coming from the Bondoc Peninsula and the Bicol Region. Very notable among these are the Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Lopez, Philippine Normal University - South Luzon, Eastern Tayabas College and the Lopez National Comprehensive High School. The Quezon Provincial Training Center of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is also located in the town. Lopez is also now home to Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) and Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) as the two state universities have started operating in the town since June 2012. Furthermore, preparatory, primary and secondary education are no longer a problem since several schools have already opened their doors in the far-flung areas to serve the rural youth as part of town's mission of bringing the schools closer to the people.\n\n\n"}

It is accessible by land from Metro Manila Passing Through Rizal Province Via Manila East Road or Via South Luzon Expressway\n\nThe municipality is known for its annual Pahiyas Festival, which is held every May 15 in honor of San Isidro Labrador the Farmer.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Japanese forces invaded and occupied on the town of Lucban. On December 26, 1941, Filipino and American troops defended Barrio Piis and the attack by the Japanese shifted to the Bataan Peninsula. After the Japanese forces occupied the town, they built a military garrison and Japanese Armed Forces were stationed in Lucban. Both local guerrilla and regular troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army initiated attacks in Lucban from 1942 to 1945.\n\nSampaloc used to be the Barrio Dingin of Lucban, Quezon consisting of three sitios. It was later renamed into Sampaloc because of the presence of a large tamarind tree found in the center of the settlement during the earlier days. The name was also changed in Alfonso Trece for a time to honor the King of Spain. In 1873, Capt. Pedro Cadelina of Lucban recommended to change the barrio into a municipality but due to lack of residents, it was only made into a “visita”. “Teniente Mayores” were appointed to head the ”visita”, the first of whom was from Polilio, followed by Arcadio Veluya, Laureano Nanola, Silverio Abueva and Juan Saludades. Through the efforts of Juan Pineda, Sampaloc became a municipality in 1892. He was elected as the first Capitan. He was succeeded by Diego Gagan followed by Teofilo Daya in 1901. During Daya's term in the office, three more barrios from Mauban – Banot, Bilucao and San Bueno, became a part of Sampaloc through the efforts of Ireneo Domeo, the municipal secretary. The town was also renamed to Sampaloc during this time.\n\nLegend has it the town derives its name from the \"lukbán\" or pomelo tree. Three hunters from neighbouring Majayjay— namely Marcos Tigla, Luis Gamba and Lucas Mañawa— lost their way following the trail of wild animals at the foot of volcanic Mount Banahaw. Resting under a tree, they saw a crow (\"uwák\") in the tree's branches, and believing this to be a bad omen, they moved to another place and rested again. Whilst in the shade of a large pomelo (\"lucbán\") tree, the trio were attracted to a couple of kingfishers (\"salacsác\") that were singing. Fascinated by the bird's plumage and rhythmic chirps, the superstitious hunters took this a sign of good fortune and thus settled in the place they named \"Lucbán.\"\n\nLucban is politically subdivided into 32 barangays.\n\n\nElected Officials of Lucban as per May 2019 Election:\n\nLucban celebrates the Pahiyas Festival every May 15 in honor of the patron saint of farmers, St Isidore the Labourer. Beginning with a 6:00am mass at the Lucban Church, this festival showcases a street of houses which are adorned with fruits, vegetables, agricultural products, handicrafts and \"kiping\", a rice-made decoration, which afterwards can be eaten grilled or fried. The houses are judged and the best one is proclaimed the winner. Every year, tourists roam the municipality to witness the decoration of houses. Nowadays, Pahiyas Festival is a week long celebration starting every 15 May.\n\n\nPublic Research University\n\nSecondary Schools:\n\nElementary Schools:\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThis place is situated on the Bondoc Peninsula; its geographical coordinates are 13° 31′ 20″ North, 122° 24′ 15″ East, and its original name was Malunay. Mulanay is about south-east from Lucena City.\n\nThe town proper, with her plain landscape, is a coastal town facing the Tayabas Bay. The municipality is being considered to be listed in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription due to its architectural marvels, notably its baroque church, its preserved ancestral houses, and the Limestone tombs of Kamhantik, a highly-significant Tagalog archaeological site and dambana, in the Buenavista Protected Landscape.\n\nMulanay is politically subdivided into 28 barangays.\nSome legends would relate Mulanay to have derived its name from the Tagalog word \"Malunay\", which means \"Plenty of Lunay\". \"Lunay\" is the vernacular term for \"Pili\" wax, which was abundant in the area.\n\nThe findings of the conducted archaeological exploration and excavation at Mt. Kamhantik Archaeological Site by the team from the National Museum headed by Dr. Eusebio Z. Dizon, Scientist III and a world renown archaeologist says Mulanay was inhabited by an organized community in the year 500AD-1300AD, who were our ancestors belonging to the Austronesian speaking people and originated from Taiwan (Peter Belwood). Austronesian people or Austronesian-speaking people are various populations found in Asia, Oceania and Africa that speak languages of the Austronesian family. These include Taiwanese aborigines; the majority ethnic groups of Malaysia, East Timor, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Madagascar, Micronesia, and Polynesia, as well as the Polynesian people of New Zealand and Hawaii, and the non-Papuan people of Melanesia. The Austronesian language is a language family that is widely dispersed throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, Madagascar and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, with a few members on continental Asia. Austronesian languages are spoken by about 386 million people, making it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers.\n\nThe result of the C-14 (carbon dating) on teeth found in burial No.5 at the Mt Kamhantik Archaeological Site was dated in the year 890AD or 1,220 years old (radio carbon dating result for sample IV2011F657AB, BETA ANALYTIC INC. MIAMI, FLORIDA, USA). The recent archaeological investigation on July 15-30, 2015 found a surface archaeological artifact, stone tool. And according to Dr. Eusebio Z. Dizon, Scientist III, it was a tool from the Neolithic period 10,000 BC-2,000 BC used for carving , cutting and sharpening. Other artifacts found were potteries with incised designs which were similar to the early Huynh-Kalanay Potteries of Taiwan and Vietnam from the period of 1000 BCE and 200 CE. Some were also present in the different areas in the Philippines like Sarangani, Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Bicol, Masbate and many others dating to 1000BC-300AD. Ceramics shreds from the Sung Dynasty (960AD-1279AD) were are also found in the area. These archaeological findings were evidences showing the participation of our ancestors from Mt. Kamhantik to a trade network in 500AD-1300AD.\n\nThe evangelization of Mulanay by the Franciscan Missionaries was in 1600 while its civil foundation as a municipality was effected in 1745 through the approval of the King of Spain. During the Spanish regime, Mulanay was composed of the municipal territories of San Narciso, San Francisco, Catanauan and San Andres which was as big as the province of Bataan. In 1755, Catanauan became a separate municipality followed by other remaining municipalities. Mulanay’s territorial jurisdiction was reduced to 42,000 hectares. The original town of Mulanay composed of six (6) barangays was raided by the Moro pirates that led the town’s executive together with the barangay heads to transfer the town site to the so called Mayordomo, a sitio of Barangay Latangan. After several years, raids along coastal areas were lessened. The people returned to the town site, however, few barangay heads disagreed and left for Bantuin, Marinduque and Mindoro.\n\nThe populace of Mulanay is composed of different ethnic groups like Tagalogs, Visayas and Bicolanos. Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority Census Calendar Year 2010, it has a population of 50,826. The first town head of Mulanay during the Spanish Regime was Alcalde Mayor Eustaquio Manlangit, while the first town mayor during the American Occupation was Mayor Atanacio Ojeda. The municipality had been under twenty seven mayors from Spanish Regime up to present. The incumbent mayor is Joselito A. Ojeda.\n\nAt present, Mulanay is composed of twenty eight (28) barangays, four of which comprise the poblacion. The municipality is an agricultural town where farm crops like coconut, garlic, bananas, rice, corn, peanuts, mongo, ginger, squash, and other vegetables are abundantly harvested. Mulanay lies along the coast of Tayabas Bay, an abundant fishing ground.\n\nElected officials 2013–2016:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160969", "title": "Islamic Republic of Iran Navy", "text": "Islamic Republic of Iran Navy\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (), acronymed NEDAJA (), is the naval warfare service branch of Iran's regular military, the Islamic Republic of Iran Army (\"Artesh\").\n\nIt is charged with the responsibility of forming Iran's first line of defense in the Gulf of Oman and beyond with the mission of acting as an effective blue-water navy. However, it is generally considered as a conventional green-water navy as it mostly operates at a regional level, in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman but also as far afield as the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and northwest quarter of the Indian Ocean. In July 2016, the Navy said that it would establish a presence in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOne of Iran's two maritime military branches alongside the IRGC Navy, it overlaps functions and areas of responsibility with the other navy, but they are distinct in terms of military strategy and equipment. In contrast to the IRGC Navy, which is equipped with small fast-attack crafts, the backbone of the Artesh navy's inventory consists of larger surface ships, including frigates and corvettes, and submarines. \n\nIn December 2019, the Iranian Navy's head Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi stated that the Iranian Navy will engage in annual joint exercises with Russia and China.\n\nAn Iranian navy in one form or another has existed since Achaemenid times and the First Persian Empire around 500 BC. The Islamic Republic of Iran Navy came into being when the former Imperial Iranian Navy (IIN) of the Pahlavi Era was renamed following the Iranian Revolution in 1979.\nThe Iranian navy was rebuilt after being almost completely destroyed during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in World War II. Following World War II, the fleet began replacing destroyed warships with destroyers, frigates and many smaller vessels, including powerboats and hovercraft, many of which originated from the US and UK, which had played a part in destroying much of the original equipment in World War II. In the 1970s, Iran planned to extend its naval reach into the Indian Ocean; but this goal was curtailed by the Islamic Revolution (1979), and the ensuing western-backed, first Persian Gulf War (Iran–Iraq War) (1980–1988) which left it hampered in the face of the invasion.\n\nMohammed-Reza, the last Shah of Iran, ordered four modern general purpose destroyers from the United States and eight modified s from Royal Schelde, but both contracts were canceled after the 1979 Iranian revolution. The destroyers were instead commissioned in the U.S. Navy as the , while construction of the frigates had not yet started.\n\nFollowing this was the US-led arms embargo on Iran and the Iran–Iraq War, in which the IRIN played a role. The arms embargo restricted Iran's ability to maintain and equip its navy. It had to find new sources of armaments. Equipment and weaponry were imported from the Soviet Union, China, North Korea and later, Russia. Iran also established its own domestic armaments industry. This industry has also supported the navy by providing weaponry, equipment and spare parts.\n\nIn terms of major surface ships, Iran relies on its s as well as the new s which were indigenously developed in Iran and are reverse engineered \"Alvand\" class with modern electronics, radar and armament. Iran's three destroyers are over 50 years old and are kept in material reserve at Bushehr. The navy does not include capital ships; its largest ships are four frigates and three corvettes, all of which are armed with modern anti-ship missiles. The main focus of the IRI Navy seems to be on developing new frigates, corvettes and medium to large fast boats capable of carrying modern, precision anti-ship missiles. Three of four frigates (Vosper Mark 5), however, were commissioned over 25 years ago and these ships have been updated with Chinese C-802 missiles. Iran's three corvettes were commissioned over 30 years ago; one (\"Hamzeh\") was originally a government yacht but has now been armed with C-802 missiles as well, but it is deployed at Anzali on the Caspian Sea. These eight ships are supported by three Russian built, SSK attack submarines and and mini submarines.\n\nIn July 2016, the Navy said that it would establish a presence in the Atlantic Ocean, of unspecified duration.\n\nIn December 2019, the Iranian Navy's head Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi acknowledged in a televised interview that the Navy was now dependent on annual joint exercises with Russia and China and efforts to form alliances with other countries were \"pointless.\"\n\nSuffering from decaying Western-supplied weapons purchased by the Shah, Tehran has been acquiring new weapons from Russia, China and North Korea. Iran has expanded the capabilities of the naval branch of the IRGC, acquired additional mine warfare capability, and upgraded some of its older surface ships. Iran's exercises have included a growing number of joint and combined arms exercises with the land forces and air force. Iran has also improved its ports and strengthened its air defences, while obtaining some logistic and technical support from states like India and Pakistan.\n\nAs far as major new equipment is concerned, Iran has been building up its naval strength by acquiring three Kilo-class submarines from Russia, as well as other equipment, including 10 \"Houdong\" fast attack craft from China. Russia and India were reported to be assisting Iran with training and operating its Kilo-class submarines. As regards other requirements, in December 1997, Rear Admiral Mohammad Karim Tavakoli, commander of the First Naval Zone, with HQ at the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas, claimed that the Iranian Navy had completed design work on three multirole corvettes and a small submarine, to be built in Iran.\n\nIn August 2000, Iran announced that it had launched its first domestically produced light submarine or swimmer delivery vehicle, named the Al-Sabiha 15 because of its 15 meters length, in an official ceremony at the Bandar Abbas naval base. In May 2005, Iran navy announced that it had launched its first Ghadir-class midget submarine and on 8 March 2006 announced that it had launched another submarine named \"Nahang\" (Persian: whale).\n\nDuring 2000, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy Aviation significantly improved its capability by taking delivery, from Russia, of a number of Mi-8 AMT (Mi-171) transport/attack helicopters. Under a contract signed in 1999, Russia agreed to supply 21 Mi-171s to Iran. Delivery was completed in 2001; although the exact number destined for the navy was unknown. In summer 2001, there were indications that Iran would order a further 20 Mi-171s, although as of mid-2004, it was not known if this had occurred.\n\nIn November 2002 sources at both Iran's Aerospace Industries Organisation (AIO) and the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (COSIC) confirmed that the two groups were working on common anti-ship missile production and development. The effort, which Iranian sources call Project Noor, covers the short-range C-701 and the long-range C-802 weapons developed by COSIC's China National Precision Machinery Import and Export Co subsidiary. The possibility that a formal collaborative project was under way was first raised in 1998, when Iran displayed an Anti-Ship missile design similar to the range C-701 shortly after the Chinese system was unveiled.\n\nAn AIO spokesperson confirmed that Project Noor involves the C-701. However, officials in the same company describe the weapon as \"a long-range, turbojet-powered, sea-skimming Anti-Ship missile,\" which better fits the range C-802, and suggests that the co-operation agreement may cover both weapon systems. In early 2004, Iran announced the release of a new cruise missile program named Raad (Thunder). The Raad appears to be a modification of the Chinese HY-2 (CSSC-3) anti-ship missile, one of a series of missiles China developed from the original Soviet-era P21 (SS-N-2C) design.\n\nOn 29 September 2003, Iran's domestically produced Sina-class (reverse engineered from the \"Kaman\" class) missile boat , equipped with modern anti-ship missiles and modern electronics entered service in the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy. The ship was launched in the Caspian Sea to protect Iran's interests there and was mentioned among the achievements of the Iranian Navy by Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari.\n\nOn 22 September 2006, Iran announced to have commissioned their second self-made \"Kaman\"-class missile boat, . Built in memory of the original \"Joshan\", lost in the Persian Gulf during Operation Praying Mantis on 18 April 1988. According to Iran's Navy commander Admiral Kouchaki, \"Joshan\" has a claimed speed of over [3] and \"enjoys the world's latest technology, specially with regard to its military, electrical and electronic systems, frame and chassis, and it has the capabilities required for launching powerful missiles.\"\n\nIn 2002, Iran announced it would start the production of its first domestically produced destroyer. By most international standards the ship, the first of the Moudge class, would be considered a light frigate or a corvette. On 24 November 2007 Iran's rear admiral Habibollah Sayyari announced that Iran would launch its first domestically produced destroyer, , though internationally rated as a frigate, and an Iranian Ghadir-class submarine. It is said to be a sonar evading stealth submarine. Initially known as \"Moje\", then \"Moje I\", finally \"Jamaran\", appears to be a development of the \"Alvand\" class. The Moudge or Moje-class guided missile frigate entered service in 2010. Another frigate in the same class, named \"Damavand\", has been commissioned in the port of Bandar Anzali in the Caspian Sea in 2013. This ship just like the Jamaran has the capability to: carry helicopters, anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes, modern guns and air defence guns. The ship is also equipped with electronic warfare devices. The two mentioned frigates have brought Iran's frigate arsenal from 3 to 5, while two others are being built, to be added to Iran's fleet of warships in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn March 2006, the navy deployed a submarine named \"Nahang\" (Whale), with pictures broadcast by state media at the time showing s a minisub.\n\nOn 22 February 2008, the Iranian Defense Ministry announced that 74 domestically produced \"gunboats\" (small missile boats) had entered service with the Iranian Navy. The Navy has had reported to have the Hoot supercavitating torpedo and the Thaqeb (missile) in trials or service, though reliable information is scarce.\n\nIran's Deputy Navy Commander Captain Mansour Maqsoudlou announced in February 2010 that Iran has begun planning to design, and manufacture domestically built aircraft carriers. The initial designs for building the carriers has been approved as of 2010 and the process of research and the design for the aircraft carrier is currently being looked into by the Iranian government. However, as of August 2013, the Iranian Navy was still in the research and design stages due to lack of government support and funding.\n\nIn 2012, Iran overhauled one of the Kilo-class submarines in its possession, IRS \"Younis\". Iran was able to complete this re-haul at Bandar Abbas naval base. In addition the Iranian Navy has modernized and re-commissioned the 1,135-ton s; equipped with Noor anti-ship cruise missiles and torpedo launchers. Another modern frigate named \"Sahand\", with 2,000 tons displacement was being fitted up with weapons and equipment in Bandar Abbas naval base; and was planned for launch in 2013.\nIn July 2012, foreign analysts reported that Iran was gaining new deployment capabilities, allegedly to strike at US warships in the Persian Gulf in the case of an armed conflict, amassing an arsenal of anti-ship missiles while expanding its fleet of fast-attack crafts and submarines. Many of the systems were developed with foreign assistance, such as the anti-ship missiles Silkworm, which is Chinese-made, and high-speed torpedoes based on Russian designs. In weeks prior, Iranian leadership had been threatening to shut down shipping in the gulf region as retaliation for any attacks by the United States on its nuclear facilities.\nIn December 2014, Iran conducted joint wargames involving the Iranian Army, Air Force and Navy. Naval phase took part on a wide area, ranging from Persian Gulf to northern Indian Ocean and to Gulf of Aden. New systems were tested, including new anti-ship cruise missiles, electro-magnetic and acoustic naval mine-sweeping system and Fateh submarine.\n\nOn February 17, 2019, news papers reported that Iran has unveiled domestically produced submarine capable of firing cruise missiles. On November 30, 2019, Iran's navy announced the mass production of the Jask cruise missile, which is launched from Iranian submarines. It also unveiled a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) naval drone named Pelican-2, which had already been deployed on \"naval fleets in international waters.\"\n\nIran's navy deployed two warships to the Gulf of Aden in August 2019 to protect commercial shipping, including the destroyer Sahand and the supply ship/replenishment oiler Kharg. In September 2019, the head of the Iran navy said it was ready to defend its marine borders, and denied US and Saudi claims that Iran had orchestrated recent attacks on Saudi oil sites. On November 20, 2019, Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Iran's navy had sent a fleet of 64 ships to the Gulf of Aden to \"safeguard Iran's interests\" in an \"insecure seafaring region.\" The month prior, a maritime coalition led by the United States had formally launched operations in the Gulf. The Iran and US navies subsequently encountered each other in the Strait of Hormuz on November 23, 2019, with no conflict.\n\nOn December 4, 2019, Khanzadi stated that exercises, called Marine Security Belt, with China and Russia would begin on December 27 in the northern Indian Ocean. On December 30, 2019, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi acknowledged during a televised interview with the semi-official Mehr News Agency that the Iranian Navy conducted joint exercises with Russia and China and will continue to do so on an annual basis. However, Khanzadi also stated that the drills were now needed due to a lack of coordination. He also stated that invitations which invited other countries to participate in the drills were unsuccessful. All participants described the exercise as defensive in nature, with Khanzadi also stating that it was a \"highly significant message\" to the United States and allies.\n\nIn 1977, the bulk of the fleet was shifted from Khorramshahr to the new headquarters at Bandar-e Abbas. Bushehr was the other main base; smaller facilities were located at Khorramshahr, Khark Island, and Bandar-e Imam Khomeini (formerly known as Bandar-e Shahpur). Bandar-e Anzali (formerly known as Bandar-e Pahlavi) was the major training base and home of the small Caspian Sea fleet, which consisted of a few patrol boats and a minesweeper. The naval base at Bandar Beheshti (formerly known as Chah Bahar) on the Gulf of Oman had been under construction since the late 1970s and in late 1987 still was not completed. Smaller facilities were located near the Strait of Hormuz. Iran also announced that new base is established in the Oman Sea.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nPitogo is politically subdivided into 39 barangays.\n\n\nThe fact that Pitogo is built on a promontory of rolling hills has a great rationale behind. Historical records show that this site was selected by the town’s founders in 1766 because its lofty elevation provided them with good look out points for the marauding vintas of Muslim pirates who were then threatening the safety of the natives.\n\nIn 1754, a band of Christian settlers led by Juan Mauricio founded the town farther inland, a few miles up the Mayubok River, (now Pinagbayanan), to be safe from Moro depredations. But despite this precaution, the Moros came and raided the town. They came along the coastal town of Kalilayan (Tayabas).\n\nTwo years later, in 1756, Alejo Bautista became the next ruler. Again, the Moros remembering the place, visited Mayubok, burned the settlement and killed many of its inhabitants. Due to so much fright, the people placed the biggest church bell in a banca but the banca capsized at Aasnan. Expert divers tried to recover the historic bell but their toil remained futile and all in vain.\n\nThe survivors built another settlement in 1760 along the banks of Cawayanin River under Bernabe Rafael. Likewise, this community was destroyed by the Moros. St. Paul (the patron saint) was lost. He was found in a nearby barrio. The people stayed for a short time in the said barrio naming it “Adia” meaning safety.\n\nIn 1766, Buenaventura Salvador selected a well-located hill, the Maaliw Hill where few fishing huts could be found. The place was chosen because from its summit, where a native watchtower (Castillo) could be found, the approaching Moro Vintas could easily be detected while still afar.\n\nThe founding of Pitogo became very sure when a strong ruler in the person of Geronimo Santiago took care of the poblacion. He was known as Maniago whom the pirates feared so much. He ruled for almost ten years from 1771 to 1780. During that time the patron saint became famous too. The belief was that St. Paul was protecting miraculously the new town. On one occasion, when the Moros were about to enter the town, the place became all darkness and so the Moros had not other recourse but to go away.\n\n1781 came and Juan Encarnacion became the ruler. According to legend, this was the time when St. Paul the Apostle was found under a big Pitogo tree on the promontory of Maaliw Hill. Taking this as a good omen and believing that St. Paul liked the place to be the permanent location of the poblacion, the people named the place after this palm tree known as “Pitogo” and began to settle here. This name later applied to this whole town as the community grew.\n\nAnother Mauricio became the ruler in 1814. The town was burned for the first time due to the carelessness of the inhabitants.\n\nA very good ruler in the person of Geronimo de los Angeles came in 1817. During his time the stone church was built on the same place where St. Paul was once found on Maaliw Hill.\n\nFor two centuries, Pitogo had survived Muslim raids, epidemic conflagrations and two major wars to emerge as a thriving, pulsating community that has seen some progress during the past decades.\n\n\nSecondary schools:\nElementary schools:\n\n"}

Such reactions may be represented by equations of the following form: X + Y → XY.\nThe combination of two or more elements and form one compound is called combination reaction.\n\nThere is no specific number of reactants in a combination reaction.\n\nCombination reactions are usually exothermic because when the bond forms between the reactants, heat is released. For example, \"barium metal\" and fluorine gas will combine in a highly exothermic reaction to form the salt barium fluoride:\n\nAnother example is magnesium oxide combining with carbon dioxide to produce magnesium carbonate.\n\nAnother example is iron combining with sulfur to produce iron(II) sulfide.\n\nWhen a combination reaction occurs between a metal and a non-metal the product is an ionic solid. An example could be lithium reacting with sulfur to give lithium sulfide. When magnesium burns in air, the atoms of the metal combine with the gas oxygen to produce magnesium oxide. This specific combination reaction produces the bright flame generated by flares.\n\nCombination reactions can also occur in other situations when the two products do not have the same ionic charge. In such a situation, different quantities of each reactant must be used. To denote this in a chemical equation, a coefficient is added to one or more of the reactants so that the total ionic charge of each reactant is the same. For example, Iron (III) Oxide is formed by the following equation: <chem>4Fe + 3 O2 -> 2Fe2O3</chem>.

He was the son of Saint Sigrada and the brother of Saint Warinus.\n\nLeodegar was an opponent of Ebroin, the Frankish Mayor of the Palace of Neustria and the leader of the faction of Austrasian nobles in the struggle for hegemony over the waning Merovingian dynasty. His torture and death made him a martyr and saint.\n\nLeodegar was the son of a high-ranking Burgundian nobleman, Bodilon, Count of Poitiers and Paris and Sigrada of Alsace, who later became a nun at Sainte-Marie de Soissons. His brother was Warinus.\n\nHe spent his childhood in Paris at the court of Clotaire II, King of the Franks and was educated at the palace school. When he was older he was sent to Poitiers, where there was a long-established cathedral school, to study under his maternal uncle, Desiderius (Dido), Bishop of Poitiers. At the age of 20 his uncle made him an archdeacon.\n\nShortly afterwards he became a priest, and in 650, with the bishop's permission, became a monk at the monastery of St Maxentius in Poitou. He was soon elected abbot, and initiated reforms including the introduction of the Benedictine rule.\n\nAround 656, about the time of the usurpation of Grimoald in Austrasia and the banishment of the boy-heir Dagobert II, Leodegar was called to the Neustrian court by the widowed Queen Bathilde to assist in the government of the united kingdoms and in the education of her children. Then in 659 he was named to the see of Autun, in Burgundy. He again undertook the work of reform and held a council at Autun in 661. The council denounced Manichaeism and was the first to adopt the Trinitarian Athanasian Creed. He made reforms among the secular clergy and in the religious communities, and had three baptisteries erected in the city. The church of Saint-Nazaire was enlarged and embellished, and a refuge established for the indigent. Leodegar also caused the public buildings to be repaired and the old Roman walls of Autun to be restored. His authority at Autun placed him as a leader among the Franco-Burgundian nobles.\n\nMeanwhile, in 660 the Austrasian nobles demanded a king, and young prince Childeric II was sent to them through the influence of Ebroin, the mayor of the palace in Neustria. The queen withdrew, from a court that was Ebroin's in all but name, to an abbey she had founded at Chelles, near Paris. On the death of King Clotaire III in 673, a dynastic struggle ensued, with rival claimants as pawns; Ebroin raised Theoderic to the throne, but Leodegar and the other bishops supported the claims of his elder brother Childeric II, who, by the help of the Austrasians and Burgundians, was eventually made king. Ebroin was interned at Luxeuil and Theoderic sent to St. Denis.\n\nLeodegar remained at court, guiding the young king. In 673 or 675, however, Leodegar was also sent to Luxeuil. The cause, a protest against the marriage of Childeric and his first cousin, is a hagiographic convention; as a leader of the Austrasian and Burgundian nobles, Leodegar was easily represented as a danger by his enemies. When Childeric II was murdered at Bondi in 673, by a disaffected Frank, Theoderic III was installed as king in Neustria, making Leudesius his mayor. Ebroin each took advantage of the chaos to make his escape from Luxeuil and hasten to the court. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once again, still Leodegar's implacable enemy. \nAbout 675 the Duke of Champagne, the Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne and the Bishop of Valence, stirred up by Ebroin, attacked Autun, and Leodegar fell into their hands. At Ebroin's instigation, Leodegar's eyes were gouged out and the sockets cauterized, and his tongue was cut out. Some years later Ebroin persuaded the king that Childeric had been assassinated at the instigation of Leodegar. The bishop was seized again, and, after a mock trial, was degraded and condemned to further exile, at Fécamp, in Normandy. Near Sarcing he was led out into a forest on Ebroin's order and beheaded.\n\nA dubious testament drawn up at the time of the council of Autun has been preserved as well as the Acts of the council. A letter which he caused to be sent to his mother after his mutilation is likewise extant.\n\nIn 782, his relics were translated from the site of his death, Sarcing in Artois, to the site of his earliest hagiography – the Abbey of St Maxentius (Saint-Maixent) near Poitiers. Later they were removed to Rennes and thence to Ebreuil, which place took the name of Saint-Léger in his honour. Some relics are still kept in the cathedral of Autun and the Grand Séminaire of Soissons. In 1458 Cardinal Rolin caused his feast day to be observed as a holy day of obligation.\n\nFor sources to his biography, there are two early (though not contemporaneous) Lives, drawn from the same lost source (Krusch 1891), and also two later ones (one of them in verse).\n\nHistorically there was a custom among wealthy British merchants to sell in May, spend the summer outside of London, then to return on St Leger's Day. This gave rise to the saying used in regards to financial trading markets, \"Sell in May and go away, and come on back on St. Leger's Day\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker Luis Buñuel was the first to achieve universal recognition, followed by Pedro Almodóvar in the 1980s. Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like Segundo de Chomón, Florián Rey, Luis García Berlanga, Juan Antonio Bardem, Carlos Saura, Julio Médem and Alejandro Amenábar. Woody Allen, upon receiving the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award in 2002 in Oviedo remarked: \"when I left New York, the most exciting film in the city at the time was Spanish, Pedro Almodóvar's one. I hope that Europeans will continue to lead the way in film making because at the moment not much is coming from the United States.\"\n\nNon-directors, like the cinematographer Néstor Almendros, the art director Gil Parrondo, the screenwriter Rafael Azcona, the actresses Maribel Verdú and, especially, Penélope Cruz and the actors Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem and Fernando Fernán Gómez, have obtained significant recognition outside Spain.\n\nOnly a small portion of box office sales in Spain are generated by domestic films. The Spanish government has therefore implemented measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters, which include the assurance of funding from the main national television stations. The trend is being reversed with productions such as the €30 million film \"Alatriste\" (starring Viggo Mortensen), the Academy Award-winning Spanish film \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (starring Maribel Verdú), \"Volver\" (starring Penélope Cruz and Carmen Maura), and \"Los Borgia\" (starring Paz Vega), all of them sold-out blockbusters in Spain.\n\nAnother aspect of Spanish cinema mostly unknown to the general public is the appearance of English-language Spanish films such as \"Agora\" (directed by Alejandro Amenábar and starring Rachel Weisz), \"Ché\" (directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Benicio del Toro), \"The Machinist\" (starring Christian Bale), \"The Others\" (starring Nicole Kidman), Miloš Forman’s \"Goya's Ghosts\" (starring Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman), and \"The Impossible\" (starring Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts). All of these films were produced by Spanish firms.\n\nThe first Spanish film exhibition took place on May 5, 1895, in Barcelona. Exhibitions of Lumière films were screened in Madrid, Malaga and Barcelona in May and December of 1896, respectively.\n\nThe matter of which Spanish film came first is in doubt. The first was either \"Salida de la misa de doce de la Iglesia del Pilar de Zaragoza\" (\"Exit of the Twelve O'Clock Mass from the Church of El Pilar of Zaragoza\") by Eduardo Jimeno Peromarta, \"Plaza del puerto en Barcelona\" (\"Plaza of the Port of Barcelona\") by Alexandre Promio or the anonymous film \"Llegada de un tren de Teruel a Segorbe\" (\"Arrival of a Train from Teruel in Segorbe\"). It is also possible that the first film was \"Riña en un café\" (\"Brawl in a Café\") by the prolific filmmaker Fructuós Gelabert. These films were all released in 1897.\n\nThe first Spanish film director to achieve great success internationally was Segundo de Chomón, who worked in France and Italy but made several famous fantasy films in Spain, such as \"El Hotel eléctrico\".\n\nIn 1914, Barcelona was the center of the nation's film industry. The \"españoladas\" (historical epics of Spain) predominated until the 1960s. Prominent among these were the films of Florián Rey, starring Imperio Argentina, and the first version of \"Nobleza Baturra\" (1925). Historical dramas such as \"Vida de Cristóbal Colón y su Descubrimiento de América\" (\"The Life of Christopher Columbus and His Discovery of America\") (1917), by the French director Gerald Bourgeois, adaptations of newspaper serials such as \"Los misterios de Barcelona\" (\"The Mysteries of Barcelona\") starring Joan Maria Codina (1916), and of stage plays such as \"Don Juan Tenorio\" (1922), by Ricardo de Baños, and \"zarzuelas\" (comedic operettas), were also produced. Even the Nobel Prize-winning playwright Jacinto Benavente, who said that \"in film they pay me the scraps,\" would shoot film versions of his theatrical works.\n\nIn 1928, Ernesto Giménez Caballero and Luis Buñuel founded the first \"cine-club\" (film society), in Madrid. By that point, Madrid was already the primary center of the industry; 44 of the 58 films released up until that point had been produced there.\n\nThe rural drama \"La aldea maldita\" (\"The Cursed Village\") (Florian Rey, 1929) was a hit in Paris, where, at the same time, Buñuel and Dalí premiered \"Un chien andalou\" (\"An Andalusian Dog\"). \"Un chien andalou\" has become one of the most well-known \"avant-garde\" films of that era.\n\nBy 1931, the introduction of audiophonic foreign productions had hurt the Spanish film industry to the point where only a single title was released that year.\n\nIn 1935, Manuel Casanova founded the \"Compañía Industrial Film Española S.A.\" (Spanish Industrial Film Company Inc, Cifesa) and introduced sound to Spanish film-making. CIFESA would grow to become the biggest production company to ever exist in Spain. Sometimes criticized as an instrument of the right wing, it nevertheless supported young filmmakers such as Luis Buñuel and his pseudo-documentary \"\" (\"Breadless Land\"). In 1933 it was responsible for filming 17 motion pictures and in 1934, 21. The most notable success was Benito Perojo´s \"La verbena de la paloma\" (\"The Dove's Verbena\").They were also responsible for the 1947 \"Don Quijote de la Mancha\", the most elaborate version of the Cervantes classic up to that time. By 1935 production had risen to 37 films.\n\nThe Civil War devastated the silent film era: only 10% of all silent films made before 1936 survived the war. Films were also destroyed for their celluloid content and made into goods.\n\nAround 1936, both sides of the Civil War began to use cinema as a means of propaganda and censorship. A typical example of this is Luis Buñuel's \"España 1936\", which also contains much rare newsreel footage. The pro-Franco side founded the National Department of Cinematography, causing many actors to go into exile.\n\nThe new regime then began to impose obligatory dubbing to highlight directors such as Ignacio F. Iquino, Rafael Gil (\"Huella de luz\" (1941)), Juan de Orduña (\"Locura de amor\" (1948)), Antonio Román (\"Los últimos de Filipinas\"), José Luis Sáenz de Heredia (\"Raza\") (1942)), and Edgar Neville. Cifesa produced \"Ella, él y sus millones\" as well as \"Fedra\" (1956), by Manuel Mur Oti.\n\nFor its part, \"Marcelino pan y vino\" (1955) from Ladislao Vajda would trigger a trend of child actors, such as those who would become the protagonists of \"Joselito,\" \"Marisol,\" \"Rocío Durcal\" or \"Pili y Mili.\"\n\nJuan de Orduña would later have an enormous commercial hit with \"El Último Cuplé\" (1957), with leading actress Sara Montiel.\n\nIn the 1950s, the influence of neorealism became evident in the works of a number of rather young film directors (namely, Manuel Mur Oti, José Antonio Nieves Conde, Juan Antonio Bardem, Marco Ferreri, and Luis García Berlanga). Their main works (\"Surcos\", \"Balarrasa\", \"Todos somos necesarios\", \"Orgullo\", \"Muerte de un ciclista\", \"Calle mayor\", \"El pisito\", \"El cochecito\", \"Bienvenido Mister Marshall\", or \"Plácido\") ranged from melodrama to esperpento or black comedy, but all of them showed a strong social criticism, unexpected under a political censorship, like the one featured by Franco`s regime. From the amorality and selfishness of the upper middle class or the ridiculousness and mediocrity of the small town people to the hopelessness of the impoverished working class, every social stratum of the contemporary Spain was shown up.\n\nLuis Buñuel in turn returned to Spain to film the shocking \"Viridiana\" (1961) and \"Tristana\" (1970).\n\nNumerous co-productions with France and, most of all, Italy along the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s invigorated Spanish cinema both industrially and artistically. Actually the just mentioned Buñuel's movies were co-productions: \"Viridiana\" was Spanish-Mexican, and \"Tristana\" Spanish-French-Italian.\nAlso, the hundreds of Spaghetti-westerns and sword and sandal films shot in southern Spain by mixed Spanish-Italian teams were co-productions.\n\nOn the other hand, several American epic-scale superproductions or blockbusters were shot also in Spain, produced either by Samuel Bronston, \"King of Kings\" (1961), \"El Cid\" (1961), \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963), \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964), \"Circus World\" (1964)), or by others (\"Alexander the Great\" (1956), \"The Pride and the Passion\" (1957), \"Solomon and Sheba\" (1959), \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965), \"The Trojan Women\" (1971)). These movies employed many Spanish technical professionals, and as a byproduct caused that some filmstars, like Ava Gardner and Orson Welles lived in Spain for years. Actually Welles, with \"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955), in fact a French-Spanish-Swiss co-production, was one of the first American filmmakers to devise Spain as location for his shootings, and he did it again for \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1966), this time a Spanish-Swiss co-production.\n\nMany international actors played in Spanish films: Italians Vittorio de Sica, Vittorio Gassman and Rossano Brazzi with Mexican María Félix in \"La corona negra\"; Italian couple Raf Vallone and Elena Varzi in \"Los ojos dejan huellas\", Mexican Arturo de Córdova in \"Los peces rojos\", Americans Betsy Blair in \"Calle mayor\"; Edmund Gwenn in \"Calabuch\" or Richard Basehart in \"Los jueves, milagro\" among many others. All the foreign actors were dubbed into Spanish. Mexican actor Gael García Bernal has also recently received international notoriety in films by Spanish directors.\n\nIn 1962, José María García Escudero became the Director General of Cinema, propelling forward state efforts and the Escuela Oficial de Cine (Official Cinema School), from which emerged the majority of new directors, generally from the political left and those opposed to the Franco government. Among these were Mario Camus, Miguel Picazo, Francisco Regueiro, Manuel Summers, and, above all, Carlos Saura. Apart from this line of directors, Fernando Fernán Gómez made the classic \"El extraño viaje\" (The Strange Trip) (1964) and Víctor Erice created the internationally acclaimed \"El espíritu de la colmena\" (The Spirit of the Beehive) (1973). From television came Jaime de Armiñan, author of \"Mi querida señorita\" (My Dear Lady) (1971).\n\nFrom the so-called \"Escuela de Barcelona\", originally more experimentalist and cosmopolitan, come Jacinto Esteva, Pere Portabella, Joaquin Jordan, Vicente Aranda, Jaime Camino, and Gonzalo Suárez, who made their master works in the 1980s.\n\nIn the Basque country the directors Fernando Larruquert, Néstor Basterretxea, José María Zabalza and the producer Elías Querejeta stood out.\n\nThe San Sebastian International Film Festival is a major film festival supervised by the FIAPF. It was started in 1953, and it takes place in San Sebastián every year. Alfred Hitchcock, Audrey Hepburn, Steven Spielberg, Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor are some of the stars that have participated in this festival, the most important in Spain and one of the best cinema festivals in the world.\n\nThe Festival de Cine de Sitges, now known as the Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya (International Film Festival of Catalonia), was started in 1967. It is considered one of the best cinematographic contests in Europe, and is the best in the specialty of science fiction film.\n\nWith the end of dictatorship, censorship was greatly loosened and cultural works were permitted in other languages spoken in Spain besides Spanish, resulting in the founding of the Centro Galego de Artes da Imaxe - Filmoteca de Galicia or the Catalan Institute of Cinema, among others.\n\nAt the beginning, the popular phenomena of striptease and \"landismo\" (from Alfredo Landa) triumph. During the democracy, a whole new series of directors base their films either on controversial topics or on revising the country's history. Jaime Chávarri, Víctor Erice, José Luis Garci, Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón, Eloy de la Iglesia, Pilar Miró and Pedro Olea were some of these who directed great films. Montxo Armendáriz or Juanma Bajo Ulloa's \"new Basque cinema\" has also been outstanding; another prominent Basque director is Julio Médem.\n\nThe Spanish cinema, however, depends on the great hits of the so-called \"Madrileño comedy\" by Fernando Colomo or Fernando Trueba, the sophisticated melodramas by Pedro Almodóvar, Alex de la Iglesia and Santiago Segura's black humour or Alejandro Amenábar's works, in such a manner that, according to producer José Antonio Félez, \"50% of total box office revenues comes from five titles, and between 8 and 10 films give 80% of the total\" during the year 2004.\n\nIn 1987, a year after the founding of the Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España, the Goya Awards were created to recognize excellence in many aspects of Spanish motion picture making such as acting, directing and screenwriting. The first ceremony took place on March 16, 1987 at the Teatro Lope de Vega, Madrid. The ceremony continues to take place annually around the end of January, and awards are given to films produced during the previous year. The award itself is a small bronze bust of Francisco de Goya created by the sculptor José Luis Fernández.\n\nThe Goya Awards are the main film awards in Spain. They were established in 1987 and work similarly to the Oscar Awards. In 2013, Premios Feroz were established as the Spanish counterpart of the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThere are several International Film Festivals in Spain with important prizes for the industry. Two of them are the San Sebastián International Film Festival and the Sitges Film Festival.\n\nEnglish-language films produced by Spanish companies include \"Two Much\" (directed by Fernando Trueba, 1995), \"The Others\" (Alejandro Amenábar, 2001), \"The Machinist\" (Brad Anderson, 2004), \"Basic Instinct 2\" (produced by KanZaman Spain, 2006) or Miloš Forman’s \"Goya's Ghosts\" (Xuxa Produciones, 2006), \"The Impossible\" (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, 2012, Apaches Entertainment and Telecinco Produciones).\n\nKanZaman (Spain) and Recorded Picture Company (UK) co-produced \"Sexy Beast\", directed by Jonathan Glazer, in 1999. Films co-produced by this company include \"The Reckoning\" (Paul McGuigan, 2003), \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\", based on the Pulitzer prize winning Thornton Wilder novel of the same name and directed by Mary McGuckian. It featured an ensemble cast consisting of Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Kathy Bates and Spanish actress Pilar López de Ayala. Other films in this category are Mike Barker's \"A Good Woman\" (2004), and \"Sahara\" (Breck Eisner, 2005). In 2004, KanZaman co-produced Ridley Scott's epic film \"Kingdom of Heaven\", making it the biggest production in the history of Spanish cinema.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was also the niece of Elizabeth Blackwell, America's first female physician. Her mother introduced Susan B Anthony to the women's rights movement as well as being the first woman to earn a college degree in Massachusetts, first to keep her maiden name after getting married, and the first to speak about women's rights full-time.\n\nBlackwell was educated at the Harris Grammar School in Dorchester, the Chauncy School in Boston and Abbot Academy in Andover. She attended Boston University, where she was president of her class, and graduated in 1881, at age 24. She belonged to Phi Beta Kappa Society.\n\nBlackwell is well known for her work towards women's rights. At first resisting the cause of her mother and father, she later became a prominent reformer. After graduating from Boston University, Alice began working for the \"Woman's Journal,\" the paper started by her parents. By 1884, her name was alongside her parents on the paper's masthead. After her mother's death in 1893, Alice assumed almost sole editing responsibility of the paper.\n\nIn 1890, she helped reconcile the American Woman Suffrage Association and National Woman Suffrage Association, two competing organizations in the women's suffrage movement, into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). The movement had become split in 1869 over disputes over the degree to which women's suffrage should be tied to African-American male suffrage. This split created the AWSA, which her parents helped organize, and the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), headed by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. From 1890 to 1908, Alice Stone Blackwell was NAWSA's recording secretary and in 1909 and 1910 one of the national auditors. She was prominent in Woman's Christian Temperance Union activities. In 1903, she reorganized the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom in Boston.\n\nShe was also president of the New England and Massachusetts Woman Suffrage associations and honorary president of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.\n\nIn later life, Blackwell went blind. She died March 15, 1950 at the age of ninety-two.\n\nHer home in Uphams Corner is a site on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.\n\nAlice Stone Blackwell was also involved in humanitarian acts outside of the United States. In the 1890s, she traveled to Armenia, where she became passionately involved in the Armenian refugee community. She sold some of her possessions, particularly the oriental rugs from her house on Pope's Hill in Dorchester, to benefit the Armenians and feed their children, and she also provided assistance to adults looking for jobs. This is also when she discovered her interest in international literature. She translated many of the country's works into English in \"Armenian Poems\" (1896). She would continue translating literature into English, including works of Hungarian, Yiddish, Mexican, French, Italian, and Russian poetry.\n\n\n\n"}

Each year the city receives approximately 60,000 visitors from around the globe. The city also acts as a gateway for commerce and traffic crossing into and out of Bolivia from and to Chile, and there is a customs and immigration post downtown. Agriculture in the area is generally limited to quinoa, llamas, and sheep.\n\nFounded in 1890 as a trading post, the city has a population of 29,672 (2012 official census). The town has an extensive street-market. It lies at the edge of an extensive plain at an elevation of above sea level, with more mountainous country to the east.\n\nIt is an important transport hub, being the location of a major railway junction. Four lines join here, respectively from La Paz (via Oruro), Calama (in Chile), Potosí, and Villazón (on the Argentine border, where the line now ends).\n\nUyuni is connected by road to Oruro - La Paz, Sucre, Villazón (border with Argentina) and Ollagüe, Chile.\n\nThe city is also served by the Joya Andina Airport. Currently, two local airlines are flying regularly to the city from La Paz, Sucre and Rurrenabaque: Amazonas and Transporte Aéreo Militar.\n\nOne of the major tourist attractions of the area is an antique train cemetery. It is located 3 km outside Uyuni and is connected to it by the old train tracks. The town served in the past as a distribution hub for the trains carrying minerals on their way to the Pacific Ocean ports. The train lines were built by British engineers who arrived near the end of the 19th century and formed a sizable community in Uyuni. The engineers were invited by British-sponsored Antofagasta and Bolivia Railway Companies, which is now Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia. The rail construction started in 1888 and ended in 1892. It was encouraged by the then Bolivian President Aniceto Arce, who believed Bolivia would flourish with a good transport system, but it was also constantly sabotaged by the local indigenous people who saw it as an intrusion into their lives. The trains were mostly used by the mining companies. In the 1940s, the mining industry collapsed, partly due to the mineral depletion. Many trains were abandoned thereby producing the train cemetery. There are talks to build a museum out of the cemetery.\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Uyuni has a cold desert climate (\"BWk\").\n\n"}
{"id": "2161074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161074", "title": "Randy Wigginton", "text": "Randy Wigginton\n\nRandy Wigginton was one of Apple Computer's first employees (#6), creator of MacWrite, Full Impact, and numerous other Mac applications. He used to work in development at eBay, Quigo, Inc and Move.com. In November 2010, he left his position as a \"site reliability engineer\" at Google Inc., purportedly after leaking news of a $1,000 holiday cash bonus to employees.\n\nWigginton was a student at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California, interested in computers just as the earliest microprocessor-based computers were being assembled by hobbyists. Around the age of 14, he had heard about the Homebrew Computer Club, but had no way to get there until he started getting rides with another club member, Steve Wozniak, who lived down the street from Wigginton's family home. The two became friends, and Wigginton became one of Apple's earliest employees in 1976, and was present with Wozniak when the Apple I was first presented to the world at a Club meeting.\n\nWigginton collaborated with Wozniak on the circuit design and ROM software for the Apple II in 1977. As Wozniak wired up color graphics circuitry, Wigginton wrote machine language graphics subroutines, and Chris Espinosa, another high school student, wrote demo programs in BASIC. Wigginton wrote several early programs for the Apple II, including a checkbook-balancing program co-authored with Apple's vice-president of Marketing Mike Markkula. Wigginton was one of the Apple employees who adapted Microsoft's 6502 BASIC for the Apple II; it was dubbed Applesoft BASIC. The \"Applesoft BASIC Reference Manual\" includes a section entitled \"Rounding can be Curious\", in which it is documented that the ROUND function, which rounds a number to a prescribed accuracy, is not monotonic: in other words, for some \"x\" and \"y\", such that \"x\"<\"y\", ROUND(\"x\")> ROUND(\"y\"). (The problematic ROUND function does not appear in Applesoft II, the version that most Apple II users are familiar with.)\n\nPerhaps his most critical early contribution was the RWTS (read/write track-sector) routines for the Disk II, the 5\" floppy disk controller introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) show in early 1978. Wigginton and Wozniak wrote the final version of the software in Wozniak's hotel room on the eve of the show.\n\nIn 1979, Apple President Mike Scott asked Wozniak to write a secret competitor to VisiCalc, to use as leverage against Personal Software. Wozniak was reluctant because he was unsure whether creating a rival spreadsheet software would be copyright infringement, so Scott ordered Wigginton to do so. With help from Wozniak and Gull Banks, Wigginton developed The Spreadsheet, codenamed \"Mystery House\". He later claimed that it \"became the most incredibly intense political football you can imagine ... the product was completed and had manuals when Apple decided not to sell it\". Call-A.P.P.L.E. in 1982 briefly distributed it before Apple withdrew permission, making The Spreadsheet a cult classic because of the rarity and Wozniak's involvement. Wozniak wrote the math routines as they could be used for other software, Banks wrote disk routines, and Wigginton wrote most of the code.\n\nWigginton was a member of the original Apple Macintosh design team. Wigginton left Apple in September 1981 and formed Encore to work on his own. However, he was quickly contracted by Apple to help work on MacWrite on a semi-formal basis. When the Macintosh shipped in 1984 he again turned to his own projects, starting a new spreadsheet program that would eventually be released as Full Impact.\n\nFollowing his career at Apple, Wigginton worked as an engineer at companies including eBay, Google, Chegg, and Square, Inc., among others.\n\n"}
{"id": "2161075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161075", "title": "Iacob Heraclid", "text": "Iacob Heraclid\n\nIacob Heraclid (or Eraclid; ; 1527 – November 5, 1563), born Basilicò and also known as Iacobus Heraclides, Heraclid Despotul, or Despot Vodă (\"Despot the Voivode\"), was a Greek Maltese soldier, adventurer and intellectual, who reigned as Prince of Moldavia from November 1561 to November 1563. He is remembered as a pioneer of the Protestant faith in Eastern Europe, a champion of Renaissance humanism, and a founder of academic life in Moldavia. Active within the Greek diaspora in several countries, he was a student of Hermodorus Lestarchus, and worked as a scribe alongside his cousin, Iakobos Diassorinos. Heraclid forged his genealogy several times, claiming to be a member of the Branković dynasty; he was more reliably related to the Byzantine nobility in Rhodes, and claimed the titular lordship of Samos. In the late 1540s and early '50s, he studied medicine at the University of Montpellier, and married a local. A duelist and alleged infanticide, Heraclid fled over the border with the Holy Roman Empire before he could be executed for murder. He was slowly won over by the Reformation, serving the Protestant princes of the Upper Saxon Circle.\n\nDuring his travels in the Habsburg Netherlands, Heraclid was admitted to the court of Emperor Charles V, serving under him in the Last Italian War. He was made a Count Palatine and became a recognized authority on military matters, authoring several books in New Latin. Returning to civilian life, he focused his attention on missionary activity, and networked with the leading Lutherans in Wittenberg, though he began sympathizing more with Calvinism. With recommendations from Philip Melanchthon, he traveled through Northern Europe and had a spell teaching mathematics at the University of Rostock. He eventually reached Poland and Lithuania by way of Prussia, focusing on a project to unite the local Evangelical and Calvinist Churches. His own Calvinism wavered at the court of Mikołaj \"the Red\" Radziwiłł: Heraclid turned to Radical Reformation, and adopted a Unitarian position, without abjuring publicly.\n\nNetworking between the Habsburg Monarchy and Polish nobility, \"Despot\" was able to credibly claim the throne of Moldavia. Involved in an unsuccessful plot to assassinate the titular Prince, Alexandru Lăpușneanu, he returned with a mercenary army, winning at Verbia and taking Suceava. Upon gaining control of the country, he issued an edict of toleration, which favored the brief ascendancy of Moldavian Protestants. Heraclid never explicitly stated his own affiliation, appeasing the dominant Moldavian Orthodox Church and performing the duties of an Orthodox monarch. He also formulated a political program which announced Romanian nationalism, promising to conquer Wallachia and Transylvania; he saw himself as a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire, and made several attempts to capture parts of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom in conjunction with the Habsburgs. Proclaiming himself a \"King\" or \"Palatine\" rather than Prince, he invested efforts in a dynastic union with Wallachia, which he then briefly invaded. Despot's long-term goal was to obtain independence from the Ottoman Empire following a European-led \"crusade\".\n\nSeveral religious controversies contributed to social unrest in Moldavia. Despot's prohibition of divorce, his lapses into Protestant iconoclasm and his fiscal policies all served to alienate the public; this conflict was aggravated by his plan to marry a Calvinist, which opened the prospect of a Protestant dynasty. Weakened by Despot's disputes with Olbracht Łaski and the Zaporozhian Cossacks, the regime was brought down by the pretender Ștefan Tomșa. After a months-long siege in Suceava, Despot surrendered and was immediately killed, probably by Tomșa's own hand. His Reformation project only survived through the small learning center he had set up at Cotnari, being dismantled in the 1580s. Despot's reign was cursed by the early Moldavian historians, but his overall contribution to Moldavia's Westernization, particularly cultural, is viewed by later scholars as meritorious. Despot reemerged as a favorite subject in modern Romanian literature, inspiring an 1879 drama by Vasile Alecsandri, and also appears in Maltese literature.\n\nIt is certain that the future Prince of Moldavia was an ethnic Greek, but his exact origin is unclear. Despot was a noted forger, described by Romanian scholar Andrei Pippidi as an \"ingenious charlatan\" and \"professional impostor\". Historian Nicolae Iorga also mentions that Despot, an \"unusual figure\", claimed \"rights to all princely thrones in existence.\" In his quest for recognition, he provided several conflicting accounts on his origins and early life, while also inventing a succession of conflicting genealogies. In separate and conflicting notices, he suggested that his place of birth was Rhodes or Samos, in the Ottoman Eyalet of the Archipelago; elsewhere, he also claimed Genoese Chios or Venetian Crete as his homeland. At least one witness heard him say that he was originally from the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nHis family tree, published by Heraclid himself at Corona in 1558, claimed that he descended from Polycrates the Samian and the Branković dynasty, rulers of the Serbian Despotate. In 1562, the French diplomat Antoine de Petronel recorded Heraclid as a claimant \"Despot of Serbia\". Later in life, Heraclid more explicitly pretended that he was a nephew of Moldavia's Stephen the Great, while adding that he descended from the House of Lusignan. Pippidi identifies some reliable parts in Despot's genealogy, referring to his kinship with the Byzantine nobility of Rhodes and with potentates from the Duchy of Naxos—possibly including Nicholas III dalle Carceri, mistakenly identified by Despot as \"Alexios\".\n\nOverall, Heraclid appears to have had a strong connection with Hospitaller Malta, with Maltese sources generally referring to him as \"Basilicus Melitensis\" or \"Basilico Maltese\" (\"Basilicus the Maltese\"). Giovanni Francesco Abela and Giuseppe Buonfiglio record his name under the Italian version, \"Basilicò\"; Pippidi reconstructs this as \"Jacob Basilicos\". Another New Latin source names him as \"Iacobus Vasilico di Marcheto\". One account in the Maltese series suggests that Heraclid was born at Birkirkara, and, according to Pippidi, this should be regarded as certain. The Maltese origin is nuanced by Buonfiglio: he recounts that Basilicò was a Maltese Greek who claimed Rhodian descent. Based on this clue, Pippidi proposes that the Heraclides family had escaped to Malta during the taking of Rhodes, with the future Despot Vodă being born in exile in 1527. The future Prince's symbolic affiliation with Rhodes is also verified by other details: in 1548, he presented himself as belonging to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rhodes. Pippidi argues that he only came to depict himself as owner of Samos because, \"unlike Rhodes or Malta, it was available, having been deserted by its inhabitants\".\n\nOne note from Despot's papers may indicate that he was the great-grandson of Caloiani Vasilico, who served the Byzantine Empire as a diplomat, shortly before the Fall of Constantinople, while also involving himself in trade with Moldavia. The latter tradition was perhaps continued by Despot's father, John Heraclides. Scholar Aleksander Kraushar once hypothesized that Despot was not in fact a son of John, but rather of shipowner Basilikos, who had helped John escape; in this reading, the Heraclides clan adopted Iacob upon Basilikos' death. According to historian Marie Kesterska Sergescu, \"Kraushar's information stands to be corrected\" by Iorga's later discoveries. Iacob himself circulated two accounts of John's life and death, claiming that he had been decapitated by the Ottomans, or alternatively by Moldavia's Prince Ștefăniță. The latter variant is viewed as more plausible by Pippidi, who notes that Despot named Hârlău as his father's place of death, and intended to consecrate a church on that spot.\n\nAccording to some readings of sources, John had another son, Demetrios, who would later play a role in Despot's Moldavian career. Other authors describe the same Demetrios as an unrelated Serb or Greek. An enemy of Despot, Ferenc Forgách, counted two brothers, one of whom was a burglar; the other lived in Venetian Cyprus. Despot's family is known to have included a Greek scribe, Iakobos Diassorinos, who was Heraclid's cousin and political partner; an uncle, Constantine, had fallen prisoner to the Ottomans during the siege of Coron.\n\nA passing mention by poet-chronicler Christian Schesaeus suggests that Despot's first language of instruction was \"Argolic\" Greek, and that his earliest travels took him to Italy. In adulthood, he could speak as many as six languages, which may or may not have included \"Vlach\". Several accounts of the period suggest that he was educated in Chios by Hermodorus Lestarchus, who introduced him to Renaissance humanism. In his record of oral history, the 18th-century author Ion Neculce alleges that Heraclid became a servant of the Brankovićes, with whom he \"was not relatives\". He claims that Despot passed himself as Jovan Branković's nephew when it could obtain him a share of the family's inheritance, and also alleges that he stole and forged Branković's personal papers. This story would place young Heraclid in the Republic of Venice or the Papal States. Antonio Maria Graziani, a diplomat of the Holy See, additionally argues that Heraclid had spent time as a copyist in the Vatican Library, though he may be confusing him with Diassorinos. Iorga draws a slightly different conclusion: noting that both Despot and Diassorinos were scribes and calligraphers, he argues that they only worked for the Bibliotheca Regia in Vienna.\n\nIorga proposes that Heraclid also spent some of his formative years in Habsburg Spain. According to scholar Eugen Denize, the hypothesis is unverified, but plausible—given Despot's familiarity with Spanish politics. He was later spotted in the Kingdom of France, meeting and befriending Justus Jonas, who probably introduced him to Reformation ideology. In 1548, he enlisted at the University of Montpellier, where he trained as a physician. A university colleague, Carolus Clusius, left notes regarding his encounters with Despot, whom he names as \"Jacques Marchetti\". Clusius depicts Despot as a philanderer and duelist, who married Gilette d'André, widow of a former rival. He accuses the future Prince of infanticide: he had arranged for a wardrobe to fall on his adoptive child.\n\n\"Marchetti\" was forced to abscond from Languedoc and France, without completing his studies. Clusius implies that this was because of his criminal lifestyle, while Felix Plater, also a student at Montpellier, suggests that Despot had killed a canon for mocking Gilette. Platter also recalls that Heraclid was tried \"in absentia\", sentenced to death by crushing, and executed in effigy on September 28, 1554. There is no explicit mention of whether or not Heraclid was involved with the Huguenots. However, this religious component may explain why Heraclid hid in the Margraviate of Baden, sheltered there by the Protestant Philibert. From Baden, Heraclid traveled to the Upper Saxon Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, in areas dominated by Lutheran \"Landeskirchen\". He spent some ten months with the Counts of Mansfeld, meeting Günther the Rich and Philip Melanchthon.\n\nHistorians debate as to whether or not Heraclid joined Günther on his travel to the Kingdom of England, but it is certain that he visited the Habsburg Netherlands. In 1553, at Brussels, Emperor Charles V recognized him as a military expert and took him into his own retinue. In the campaigns of 1554–1555, Heraclid saw action with the \"Reichsarmatur\" in the County of Flanders and at Thérouanne. He also made a decisive appearance in the battle of Renty. According to chronicler Jean-François Le Petit, \"Baſilic Marchet, Greek Gentleman & Captain\" contributed to the counterattack which forced Henry II to withdraw his army.\n\nHis competence was again recognized by Charles. On October 22, 1555, Heraclid was received into the lesser German nobility as a Count Palatine, with hereditary rights over Samos and Paros. Thereafter styling himself \"Despot of Samos and Marquess of Paros\", he was also entitled to a pension and military retinue at the emperor's expense. His participation in the siege of Thérouanne inspired him to write a book in Latin (\"De Marini quod Terovanum vocant atque Hedini expugnatione\"), which he dedicated to the Emperor's son and main successor, Philip II. This was later followed by \"Artis militaris liber primus\" (\"The First Book on Military Art\") and \"De arte militaria liber\" (\"Book on the Military Art\"). As argued by Denize, all three showed \"a very good awareness of Spanish military art\"; art historian Răzvan Theodorescu makes remarks on their \"Renaissance taste\". Medievalist Ștefan Olteanu praises Heraclid's military competence and \"genuine theoretical skills\", while writer Félix Le Sergeant de Monnecove deems Despot (or \"Jacques Basilic Marchet\") the writer \"too personal and partial to be viewed as a historian\". The first of these fascicles was published at Antwerp in 1555, and then the various parts were circulated as manuscripts which are \"similar, but not identical\".\n\nBy 1556, Heraclid was certainly a Protestant, settling in Wittenberg, capital of the eponymous duchy and the epicenter of Lutheranism. Here, he met Joachim Camerarius and Caspar Peucer, as well as, possibly, Pier Paolo Vergerio. As noted by historian Maria Crăciun, Heraclid was the first Greek man to contact German Lutherans, appearing to them as the \"symbol of a future rapprochement between the Greek church of the East and Central Europe's German Protestantism.\" According to Clusius, it was at Wittenberg that Despot first developed an interest for the affairs of Moldavia and Wallachia. In mid 1556, Despot switched his attention to the Kingdom of Poland and Duchy of Prussia, involving himself in the affairs of the Polish Evangelical Church. With letters of recommendation from Melanchthon (which described Despot as an \"honest and erudite man\"), he crossed into Mecklenburg-Schwerin, teaching mathematics at the University of Rostock. He may have also spent time in Lübeck and in the Danish realm, and in any case one of his letters from Melanchthon was addressed to Christian III. There are also clues that he visited the Kingdom of Sweden before finally sailing to Königsberg in Prussia, where he arrived in November 1556.\n\nAt the Prussian court, Heraclid met statesman John Christoporski (Krzysztoforski), who took an interest in his contributions as a tactician and ordered copies from his tracts. Duke Albert also gave Heraclid a warm welcome, but the latter only spent some two months in Prussia, leaving upon obtaining a recommendation to the court of Chancellor Mikołaj \"the Red\" Radziwiłł, in Lithuania. Despot also fought alongside Christoporski in the clashes of 1557, opposing Poland to the Livonian Order. From Vilnius, where he met other the major figures of Polish Protestantism—including Jan Łaski—, Heraclid traveled to Lesser Poland Province, and made occasional returns to Prussia. In late 1557, he was in Krakow, where he befriended scientist Georg Joachim Rheticus and a number of Protestant campaigners—including Hieronim Filipowski, Francesco Lismanini, Stanisław Lutomirski, and Marcin Zborowski; his project, masterminded by Łaski, was to reunite Evangelical and Calvinist Churches into a single Polish national church.\n\nBeyond his generic Protestantism, Heraclid's own church affiliation is an enduring subject of dispute. The general viewpoints, summarized by Maria Crăciun, are that he was either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or an opportunist with no clear commitments; a number of authors also list him as one of the Unitarians or Polish Brethren, with some noting that he came to these positions only after going through more mainstream Protestantism. Crăciun believes that the most plausible account is provided by theologian Hans Petri. This theory describes young Heraclide as a moderate Lutheran, who embraced the dissident views of Andreas Osiander while in Prussia, and finally became a Calvinist in Krakow. Crăciun suggests that Radziwiłł's influence pushed Despot into a final, Nontrinitarian stage, with influences from both Unitarianism and the Polish Brethren. Graziani reported on views allegedly held by Despot, commenting on his anticlericalism, his derision of all forms of mass, refusal to believe in transubstantiation, and dedication to Bible study. Various Catholic polemicists identified Heraclid as a \"Jew\" or \"not a Christian\". As Crăciun notes, this allegation refers to his Unitarian views, which in the popular mind had been identified with Judaizing currents.\n\nDespot's plan to take over as Prince of Moldavia by usurping Alexandru Lăpușneanu was probably hatched at Vilnius: here, he met some Moldavian boyars who had escaped Lăpușneanu's political persecutions. By 1558, he had also become aware that his genealogical claims made him a nominal relative of Princess-consort Ruxandra. Historian Șerban Papacostea argues that Demetrios settled in Moldavia long before Despot, contributing to the spread of Reformation ideas in that country before being chased out by Lăpușneanu's violent repression. Iacob himself arrived in Moldavia in 1558, already an adversary of the regime, probably with support from Poland (especially from Polish Calvinists) and from a coalition of boyars who had supported Ștefan VI Rareș. As noted by Olteanu, his plan was rendered realistic by the anarchic decline of political customs in both Danubian Principalities under the Ottoman dominion. In the very last decades of the Romanian Middle Ages, there were 21 Moldavian Princes, with each averaging \"2 years of actual governance.\"\n\nEmperor Charles' other successor, Ferdinand I, was preoccupied with securing a Habsburg family realm in Central and Eastern Europe. His son Maximilian intended to stand in the Polish royal elections; he courted the Polish nobility, whose Protestant factions conditioned their support on Habsburg acceptance of Despot. This overlapped with Heraclid's own political goals, prompting him to assure the Habsburg court of his loyalty. It is unclear if Ferdinand actually backed Despot during the late 1550s. Historian Ionel Bejenaru, who argues that they did, notes that Lăpușneanu perceived Despot as an imperial agent, and that this pushed him to enter negotiations with Ferdinand. Iorga describes Despot as a \"useful diversion\", which Ferdinand prepared for its perfect moment to deploy.\n\nAccording to Iorga, Despot was a guest at Lăpușneanu's court, charming his hosts with his accounts of Western Europe, and with his own genealogical fabrications, while omitting his criminal past. Probably just before the attempted Moldavian–Habsburg rapprochement, Heraclid conspired to poison the Prince—a plot which also involved the Unitarian physician, Giorgio Biandrata, and the Orthodox Patriarch, Joasaph II. The attempt was a failure, and Despot was forced to flee Moldavia; according to Iorga, this escape occurred as early as 1558, though Crăciun calculates early 1560. Initially, he settled in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom at the court of Dowager Queen Isabella Jagiellon. It was here that he first met a fellow adventurer, Olbracht Łaski.\n\nIn Iorga's account, this was also the time of Despot's stay in Corona, and subsequent move to Zips County, in the Habsburg parts of Hungary. He arrived at Kesmark, where he lodged in Łaski's castle. On March 3, 1560, Despot made his formal pledge to the Habsburgs. As read by historian Gheorghe Gonța, this oath marked a \"peak of Habsburg intrusions in Moldavia\", and also signaled Despot's \"complete openness toward the Occident\". By May, Lăpușneanu had alienated more of his boyars and probably even the Moldavian Orthodox Metropolis: a delegation representing both traveled to Kesmark, hoping to persuade Ferdinand and Maximilian to intervene, and also expressing support for Despot's candidacy.\n\nArranging a new expedition in Moldavia, planned for late 1560, Heraclid secured military backing from castellan Łaski, who had an understanding with Habsburg loyalists. Despot promised him ownership of Hotin Citadel, which guaranteed rights to the biggest octroi in all of Moldavia. After mortgaging his own estates, Łaski also lent 10,000 ducats to the pretender. Despot bought himself a garrison of Spanish arquebusiers. Led by a Captain Pierre Roussel (or Rossillio), these remained loyal to him to the last day of his rule. Some 500 Polish Protestants came in as volunteers. News of this reached Polish King Sigismund II Augustus, who, preferring to maintain Lăpușneanu as his subservient ally, ordered this \"mutiny\" quashed. Despot's force was attacked by troops from the Ruthenian Voivodeship, and arrested by Mikołaj Sieniawski before even reaching the Moldavian border. During this backlash, Despot dulled his enemies' vigilance by staging his own death.\n\nThe final expedition against Lăpușneanu was probably supported from outside the country by Demetrios. Despot acquired an explicit Polish endorsement, and was probably also viewed favorably by the Sublime Porte, having reportedly spent some 20,000 Goldgulden on bribes. Crucial backing for Heraclid's bid came from Joseph Nasi, the Ottoman court Jew and titular Duke of Naxos, who was on his way to becoming \"one of the most influential figures at the Porte\". Abela and Buonfiglio both claim that Heraclid was a vassal of the Knights Hospitaller, having been propped up by Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette. Pippidi believes that this act of fealty is not unlikely, but also notes that Heraclid may have paid similar homage to other European monarchs. Historian Robert Mifsud Bonnici argues that Heraclid may have returned to Malta as a monarch, to meet with Valette. However, according to Pippidi, it is improbable that such an encounter ever took place.\n\nDespot now had a larger force—comprising many Zaporozhian Cossacks, on one of their first-ever appearances in Moldavian history. Łaski mobilized this multinational force with his Latin oratory, depicting them as a liberation force, and Lăpușneanu as a tyrant. On November 18 (Old Style: November 8), 1561, Despot's coalition defeated the Moldavian military forces in the Battle of Verbia, obtaining full control over much of the country. In his biography of Heraclid, Johann Sommer noted that arquebus firepower won the day: \"most of [the Moldavians] had never before even seen those handheld bombards, and so they and their horses could catch sound of them without the greatest distress.\" Despot was also favored by an act of betrayal: the Moldavian Moțoc, with his entire cavalry force, switched sides during the clashes. A secondary fight opposed Hungarians in Despot's service to Lăpușneanu's contracted Janissaries. The latter barricaded themselves in the townhouses of Botoșani, but the Hungarians surprised them by leaping over fences, and decimated them.\n\nDespot and his men soon descended on the capital, Suceava, where Metropolitan Grigorie II de la Neamț and \"all the populace\" stepped out to greet him. Lăpușneanu escaped from battle and took refuge in Silistra Eyalet, at Kilya; the Ottoman garrison of that town had him deported to Istanbul. The final pursuit took Despot to Huși, where he defeated another portion of the loyalist army, and finally to Vaslui. On December 2, he issued his edict of toleration toward all branches of Christianity, inviting Protestants who were persecuted elsewhere to join him in Moldavia. Despot immediately canceled Lăpușneanu's program of forced conversions to Orthodoxy and restored Protestant churches to their owners, being celebrated as a protector by the Hungarian, Saxon, and Armenian communities of Moldavia. He personally appointed a bishop for the Saxon Lutheran Church, whose first task was to rebuild churches demolished by either Rareș or Lăpușneanu. Shortly after his takeover, Despot wrote Ferdinand to convince him never to back Lăpușneanu, exposing the latter as an indiscriminate murderer and Orthodox fanatic, and dwelling on his impalement of seven Protestant missionaries.\n\nIn other portions of the Vaslui edict, Despot hints at the origin of the Romanians, encouraging his boyars to live up to the Roman virtue of their ancestors. He reassured locals that he was fundamentally anti-Ottoman, promising them that he would restore Moldavian rule in the Budjak, also announcing that he intended to annex Wallachia and then \"Greece\"—described by some historians as a \"Dacian\" plan. According to Iorga, there was a more discreet note to this program: though his proclamations described the Danube as a frontier, Despot's \"grand apotheosis\" was to be a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, with himself as \"Emperor of all Eastern Christendom\".\n\nIn January–February 1562, the Prince became involved in the effort to absorb Eastern Hungary into Ferdinand's realm. He contributed to the deteriorating relations between the two camps by stating his own territorial claims in Transylvania, demanding the return of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă, and preparing a favorite of his to serve as Transylvania's puppet ruler. In the Habsburg parts of Hungary, Zsigmond Thorda described Despot as a most reliable ally who, it was hoped, would counteract and help discipline the Eastern Hungarians. The Moldavian troops, Thorda reported, were fully loyal to, and financially supported by, the Habsburgs; however, they could not be used against Eastern Hungary, for fear of angering Despot's Ottoman overlords. Diplomat Ferenc Zay was more enthusiastic about the project, arguing that Despot could incapacitate resistance by attacking in Partium while the Habsburgs took other regions. After confronting both sides of the argument, on February 15 Ferdinand appointed Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq as his rapporteur on the Moldavian matter. On the Eastern Hungarian side, Gábor Majláth began gathering troops in preparation for Despot's expected intervention.\n\nSultan Suleiman the Magnificent finally recognized Despot as his vassal on April 24, with a ceremony outside Suceava. The affair was not without some tensions: \"Kapucu\" Ferhat, who presented Despot with his \"regnal banner\", received from him a bribe of some 15,000 ducats and 100 horses; however, Ferhat still complained to the Sultan that the ceremony had been held indoors, which went against customary law. As noted by Iorga, Despot was embarrassed by the ceremony, and in his correspondence pretended that the \"banner\" signified an Ottoman order of chivalry, rather than a label of submission. Before May 1562, Suleiman, as overlord of both Moldavia and Eastern Hungary, ordered Despot and John Sigismund Zápolya to settle their differences. The monarchs complied, with Despot concealing his Habsburg sympathies and addressing letters of friendship to Zápolya.\n\nHeraclid maintained his objectives and, as early as June 1562, sent letters to Székely Land, encouraging its secession and union with Moldavia; his mercenary friend, Anton Székely, was entrusted with the planning of a revolt. Chronicler Nicolae Costin claims that, once informed that Zápolya had been incapacitated by illness, Despot marched his 700-strong army toward the Transylvanian border; news of Zápolya's recovery arrested his advance, somewhere on the Trotuș River. He eventually backed out of his invasion plan, sending the boyar Orăș to negotiate a peace between Zápolya and the Székelys. However, he gave a free hand to another one of his mercenaries, Paul Székely, to act as a seemingly independent warlord of Székely Land; this scenario was prevented by Zápolya, who resumed control of the areas before autumn. Around that time, Despot began sending envoys, including his confidant Pierre Roussel, to the courts of Western Europe, requesting support for an anti-Ottoman crusade. He also defied the Crimean Khanate, reducing the Moldavian annual tribute to a gift consisting of two honey barrels, and made a public show of his contempt for Ottoman merchants.\n\nDespot had fathered an illegitimate son by \"a Greek woman\", or, according to other readings, had an infant daughter. He also wanted to have a more conventional line of succession. During the first half of 1562, he planned his marriage to Princess Dobra, sister of Peter the Younger, Prince of Wallachia. For this he approached Peter's mother, Doamna Chiajna. His envoys were Moțoc and Avram Banilovschi. These two arranged for the dynastic union to take place in August, and brought back a diamond ring as Peter and Chiajna's gift for Heraclid. Later, Wallachia's \"Vornic\" Radu Socol traveled to Suceava, bringing Despot two steeds, a \"kuka\" hat with precious stones, and 24,000 ducats. Heraclid intended to make his wedding a grand ceremony. His \"extravagant parvenu's idea\" involved sending out invitations to the leading royal houses of Europe. Among the projected guests were Philip II, Duke Albert, and Hungarian Archbishop Nicolaus Olahus.\n\nThe wedding was eventually called off, prompting a swift deterioration in relations between Wallachia and Moldavia. Historians disagree on the reasons for this breakdown in negotiations. Claudiu Neagoe believes that Chiajna as probably informed that Despot intended to depose Peter and bring his own alleged brother, Demetrios, on that throne. Cătălin Pungă notes that Demetrios was not supported by Heraclid; he argues that the Wallachians no longer saw Despot as a viable choice. Another project pursued by Despot was to establish a personal union between Moldavia and a restored Kingdom of Cyprus. Also in 1562, the Venetians captured and executed Diassorinos, who was instigating a Cypriote revolt and had asked for Maltese and Ottoman assistance—Despot probably intended to make Cyprus an Ottoman client state.\n\n\"Despot's mission\", Crăciun notes, \"was to execute, in one go, the Protestant policy of Wittenberg and of the Polish nobility, together with the Emperor's anti-Ottoman policy. [...] Despot was depicted as a determining factor for the spread of Protestantism in the east\". Already in December 1561, Despot had extended an invitation to Filipowski, Lismanini, and other Polish colleagues, urging them to visit Moldavia. Soon after, the regime introduced new laws and customs, including an effective ban on divorces. This policy was also reflected in the theology of a Protestant preacher, Jan Lusinski, who arrived in Moldavia as bishop of the local Calvinists; Lusinski and his German colleague, Johann Sommer, evolved from Calvinism or Lutheranism to a Unitarian approach, which they also imposed on their congregation.\n\nHeraclid made repeated attempts to establish Moldavia as an educational center of Eastern European Reformation, inviting Lestarchus, Jonas, Rheticus, and Peucer to come and teach there. Sommer was director of Despot's \"collegium\" (or \"academy\"), set up at Cotnari. This establishment was designed to train a generation of Protestant preachers, and possibly also the administrative elites. Demetrios also made his return to Moldavia, probably in January 1562, interrupting his wider mission to spread Protestantism in the Balkans. He set up base at Cotnari, where he taught Greek. As Crăciun notes, it remains a matter of scholarly debate whether Cotnari should be viewed as Moldavia's first institution of higher learning, a local replica of the Platonic Academy, or a mere school. As Sommer himself explained, Despot offered state scholarships to Moldavia's youth. Historians disagree on whether this meant that the regime was consciously drawing them away from Orthodoxy, or simply indifferent to their beliefs.\n\nThe princely court and government apparatus included \"Logothete\" Luca Stroici, who had probably embraced Lutheranism. However, various researchers agree that Despot never made an effort to mass-convert the Orthodox population. Overall, he allowed Reformation ideas to appear in the mainstream, giving Moldavians a chance to come into direct contact with them, and hoping that they would convert on their own. Polish reports and his own letters attest that he had pledged himself to make Moldavia Protestant, but also show that he never delivered on that promise. One point of the program which was consistently pursued by Despot was the repression of Moldavian Catholicism: his transfer of Catholic property into Lutheran hands was recorded by Giovanni Botero and Jan Dymitr Solikowski.\n\nDespot was still probably on friendly terms with Grigorie II, though the lesser clergy slowly came to resent both of them. As shown by the contemporary \"Chronicle of Azarie\", Moldavians understood him to be \"of the same creed as his advisers\", namely a \"Lutheran\" and \"God's scourge\". The Orthodox Nicolae Costin took a dim view of Despot's stance on divorces, concluding that it made him an \"awful, unrepentant tyrant\". Despot angered his subjects when he began confiscating reliquaries, rizas and chalices, melting them for bullion. This remained his one documented attack on Orthodox institutions: primarily patrimonial in nature, it also reflected Despot's intention to simplify religious practice. In Orthodox and Catholic historiography, the confiscations were also regarded as proof of Despot's Protestant iconoclasm.\n\nHeraclid was aware of the mounting hostility. He survived several assassination attempts, masterminded by Lăpușneanu: in April 1562, he had Hussar Voina impaled for such an attempt in the city of Roman; in 1563, there were two other documented strikes, occurring during his military maneuvers. His clampdown on dissent included the killing of Andreica, a former \"Stolnic\", whom he regarded as a serious competitor for the throne. His lynching was staged by the Hungarian garrison of Suceava on Saint George Day 1562, and applauded by a handpicked civilian audience. Administrative letters show that, during early 1562, the Prince and Łaski had imprisoned some seven grand boyars, effectively purging his Boyar Council; later documents suggest that they were killed in custody.\n\nHowever, Despot still kept his Protestant faith secret, or not immediately apparent, performing the actions of an Orthodox monarch—including taking part in the Epiphany and bowing to kiss the Gospel. In March 1562, he restored to Humor Monastery the estate of Feredeni, which he had confiscated from Andreica. Also that year, he gave a rude reception to Wolfgang Schreiber, sent by Hans von Ungnad on a mission to convert Orthodox Christians to Lutheranism. His veto effectively took Moldavia out of the project to establish a Protestant presence in Eastern Europe at large. Crăciun proposes that this episode reflects, on one hand, Despot's attempt to placate his Orthodox subjects and, on the other, his growing and genuine dislike of the Magisterial Reformation.\n\nIn October 1562, Heraclid invaded Wallachia and routed the Wallachian army sent to repel him. He was styling himself \"palatine of Wallachia\", probably hinting that he wanted to incorporate both territories into the Holy Roman Empire, with himself as the intermediate vassal. He now also intended to place a \"son of Basarab\" on the Wallachian throne, as a puppet ruler; historians agree that this is a reference to Banul Mărăcine or Nicolaus Bassaraba, two exiled Craiovești. Despot made a public show of his supposedly precognitive dream, in which three angels brought him three crowns, or, in the version provided by the 17th-century chronicler Miron Costin, \"two gilded crowns [fell] from the skies for him to take\". Despot actually owned two such crowns, which, according to Papacostea, stood for the Upper and Lower Countries of Moldavia; they were later lost. In June 1562, Despot accused the mercenary Jean Villey of having stolen all his regalia.\n\nIn tandem, Zápolya made efforts to convince the Porte that Heraclid was a Habsburg loyalist who conspired with Emperor Ferdinand, noting that \"this Despot has manned the forts with Germans and Hungarians\", and that \"all bandits from Transylvania and Poland gathered under him\". The solution, Zápolya argued, could only be Lăpușneanu's return to his throne. During this exchange of information, the Porte discovered that its Hungarian correspondence had been copied and read by Ferdinand's regents, which sparked a brief diplomatic crisis, at the end of which Suleiman insisted that Ferdinand remove his mercenaries from Moldavia. Ferdinand complied, and Despot was only left with 800 non-German mercenaries, most of them Hungarian. Faced with Zápolya's intrigues and Chiajna's complaints, Despot also withdrew his troops from Wallachia. Nevertheless, the itinerant jurist Simon Wirt recorded a rumor that Despot (referred to as \"Desparity\") had persuaded Suleiman the Magnificent to arrest Lăpușneanu and make him a galley slave.\n\nOn January 6, 1563, Despot made another display of his respect for Orthodoxy, with a coronation ceremony at Suceava Cathedral. According to Iorga, Despot was an \"actor\" who \"altogether lived too little in the real world\", and his ambitions (such as inviting all neighboring monarchs to witness his anointment) \"would normally stir laughter.\" In some Protestant sources, the ceremony at Suceava was perceived as a betrayal, and equated with an Orthodox baptism. At the coronation and after, Despot reportedly used a non-traditional title, that of Moldavian \"King\". In addition to coins, he minted for himself a new crown and a distinguishing seal. His portrait on coinage also had a circlet, a sword, and a scepter, and carried his dedication as \"Herclis Despote Patris Patriae\". Various other documents have him as more simply \"Ioan\" (\"John\") and \"Voivode\": was his signature in Church Slavonic, \"Iohann Waiwoda\" was one of his Latin names. While \"Ioan\" was in regular use as a regnal particle for all Princes, it was extremely rare as an actual name.\n\nHis matrimonial projects then shifted focus, with Despot contemplating a stronger alliance with Polish nobility. He courted a daughter of Marcin Zborowski, sending some of his mercenaries to retrieve her, but his conflicts with the magnates put a stop to all such overtures. Also in January, Despot designated Łaski as his heir, though this recognition was conditioned on the Prince having no legitimate male children. Over the following weeks, their relationship tottered over payments of Despot's debts to Łaski. By February, Despot had cancelled Łaski's deed to Hotin, and put in his own garrison, ensuring himself against an attack from the rear. Despot centered his attempts on obtaining an understanding with the government of Poland. Sigismund Augustus had since been persuaded that Moldavia was not a threat to him and his own uneasy peace with the Ottomans. Also in 1563, Despot renewed Lăpușneanu's oath of fealty to the Polish crown. This document confirmed Moldavia's obligation to supply Poland with 7,000 soldiers, including in the event of war with the Ottomans.\n\nAt that stage, Moldavians were also enraged by Despot's new tax of a ducat on every household. By July, although he had duly paid his country's tribute (the \"haraç\"), Despot was also a \"persona non grata\" at the Porte. Papacostea and other authors believe that Despot's downfall was nevertheless accelerated by another factor, namely his pledge to marry Zborowski's daughter. It signified to the boyars that Despot wished to set up a Protestant dynasty in an Orthodox country. The rebels' indictment of the Prince specifically cited him as an enemy of God's law. In a June 1563 document, Despot refers to his succession line as: \"whomever of Our children or of Our house is to become \"hospodar\", or whoever God will select to rule upon Our land of Moldavia\".\n\nSchesaeus and Mathias Miles recount a failed attempt on Despot's life—as the culmination of a plot uniting clergymen, including Metropolitan Grigorie, and boyars. At the Eucharist of 1563, the plotters mixed the sacramental bread with poison. Despot was saved by a deserting conspirator, who made sure that Despot would not touch the bread, and invited the clergy to have first servings; according to Miles, all of them, including Grigorie, died within hours of the meal. Schesaeus believes that only \"the monks\" were poisoned, while boyars were ambushed and stabbed to death by loyalist mercenaries.\n\nIn its final form, the plot centered on \"Hatman\" Ștefan Tomșa and Moțoc, who co-opted a deserting courtier, Iosif Veveriță. Another \"Hatman\", Toma Barnovschi, formerly seen as Despot's \"Viceroy\", was reportedly threatened with bodily harm in order to join that conspiracy. In another conspiratorial action, the boyars managed to poison Lusinski, who was then buried outside Suceava. During that summer, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, \"Hetman\" of the Zaporizhian Sich, intervened in Moldavia with the probable intention of seizing Despot's throne. Alarmed, Despot offered Vyshnevetsky peace, promising a gift of 1,000 horses and some thousands of oxen. Although supported by Łaski, Vyshnevetsky's forces were finally crushed. One account suggests that Vyshnevetsky and Łaski quarreled; the former reached an understanding with Despot, and was delivered by Łaski into Tomșa's hands. The Zaporizhian \"Hetman\" was then dispatched to Istanbul, and impaled on hooks.\n\nThe army that had defeated Vyshnevetsky then besieged Despot at Suceava for some three months. The boyars had ambushed many of Despot's mercenaries, having invited them to a staged celebration at Sipoteni. In parallel, Tomșa encouraged an anti-Protestant pogrom, which exterminated Lusinski's widow and child, Despot's son, and a number of Cotnari's Calvinist families. Main targets also included Armenian women, after some were caught praying for Despot's well-being. Sommer recounts that these events came just as Lestarchus, finally answering Despot's invitation, was preparing to enter the country, prompting the scholar to return home. There were several aborted moves to restore the old regime. One version is that Łaski switched sides again, returning to serve Despot and the Habsburg cause in exchange for the return of Hotin. Other authors argue that this never happened, despite Despot's desperate attempts. A more sustained effort came from a Habsburg envoy, Melchior Balassa.\n\nInside Suceava, Heraclid believed that he was facing a mutiny of his infantrymen, and executed their leader, Captain Devay or Dervici. Reportedly, the decision was rash, and actually pushed the troops into rebellion. The chronicler Grigore Ureche reports that the survivors intended to take their revenge and kill Despot, but feared that they would be decapitated for treason. Eventually, the Hungarian mercenaries inside Suceava turned against Despot, exhausting his capacity for resistance. The Prince then prepared his surrender. His physician, Dyonisus d'Avalos, claimed that just hours before his death, he renounced and denounced Reformation as a whole, deploring his own role in the \"mockery of the divine religion\" and voicing the wish to withdraw to a monastery. This narrative is partly corroborated in Catholic reports of the period, which claim that Despot's final wish was to be ordained. According to Crăciun, the exhibition was insincere, a final act in the constant dissimulation of Heraclid's Protestant or Unitarian faith.\n\nDespot's surrender and death are dated to November 4–5, 1563. He stepped out of the fortress, dressed in full regalia, and walked or rode toward his enemies. Ureche recounts that Despot met Tomșa just outside the city walls, on the open fields of Areni. In anticipation, the rebel leader had gathered here the estates of the realm, to approve of his own coronation. According to various accounts, Tomșa personally killed Despot in front of the assembly, striking him with a mace. Ureche and Schesaeus suggest that death came not from the blow itself, but from being left to bleed. Other sources contrarily note that Despot was killed by one or several executioners. An 18th-century chronicle reports that Despot's body was taken for burial at Putna Monastery, but this contradicts sources which say that his grave was dug at Areni. Schesaeus notes that Despot had been reduced to pieces by the \"rabid crowd\", whereas Sommer only recalls that Despot's severed head was embalmed and sent as a gift to Istanbul. As this occurred, Tomșa also arrested Demetrios, but pardoned him, marking his nose with a cut—since mutilation technically invalidated him from ever taking the throne.\n\nFranciscus Pestientis, the pseudonymous Habsburg spy, noted immediately after that Zápolya was directly involved in Despot's assassination, thus securing Eastern Hungary's other border in case of a Habsburg attack from the west. Soldiers sent by Zápolya were present at the final taking of Suceava. This was a major setback for the Habsburg designs in Eastern Europe, and contributed to the reorientation of Ferdinand's foreign policies. According to Denize, Despot's own \"Dacian\" plan was not fully abandoned by the Moldavians, but resumed in later generations within \"more realistic proportions\". Historians such as Adolf Armbruster and Cătălin Pungă note that the 1561 discourse holds the first traces of Romanian nationalism. Pungă argues that Despot adopted it for the \"captatio benevolentiae\" of his subjects, meaning that the idea of a Moldo–Wallachian political union preceded Despot's reign. As argued by Theodorescu, Despot, as a \"cultured adventurer\", was one of those figures who \"affirmed sonorously the Romanians' Romanness\".\n\nTomșa took the throne, though he never managed to obtain Ottoman recognition; he was also attacked by Peter the Younger, who dreamed of uniting the two thrones, but was able to defeat him. He and Moțoc ultimately fled to Poland, where they were put to death in May 1564. His short regnal interlude confused writers of the period: in a 1564 brief by the Venetian mercenary Giovanandrea Gromo, Despot and Tomșa are merged into a \"Stefano Eraclio\". In late 1563, having obtained Joseph Nasi's support, Lăpușneanu returned to Moldavia to begin his second reign. Allied with the Crimeans, he allowed them to raid Moldavian villages and take some 21,000 peasants as slaves. There then came new heights of terror, specifically aimed at those boyars and Orthodox priests who had supported Despot. One mass execution made 47 boyar and courtier victims. Records show that he also targeted the minority religions, ordering massacres of the Armenians and less documented persecutions of the remaining Protestants. He tolerated Catholics, and, in at least one instance, openly agreed with them that Despot had been a \"godless man\".\n\nThe new monarch reportedly ordered Despot's remains exhumed, placed in a burlap sack, and left to hang from a pole. One record claims that Putna's monks recovered them and placed them in a smaller wooden monastery; two centuries after, Putna was still preserving Despot's empty grave. Lăpușneanu also delivered Demetrios to Chiajna, who ordered his public humiliation and decapitation. In 1565–1566 Łaski activated his rights to the throne, and tried to invade Moldavia with Habsburg help; he had competition from Ștefan Mâzgă, endorsed by Pierre Roussel and Ferenc Zay. Also then, impostors claiming to be Despot's brother or son appeared in Venetian territories or under Habsburg rule. Peter the Younger's rival Mărăcine, who was living in exile in Istanbul, had been executed on Suleiman's orders. Nicolaus Bassaraba followed in Despot's footsteps, escaping to Malta, then to Spain.\n\nThe \"Chronicle of Azarie\" includes a posthumous damnation of Despot. His death, the author claimed, had \"stifled the amber that produced a smoke of non-belief\". Traditional Moldavian historiography replicated this narrative, asserting that Despot's downfall was an act of divine retribution. Crăciun notes that the \"reactive violence or intensity offer a measure of the impact his [religious] policies have had on Moldavian society\". Another author, Cristian Luca, proposes a parallel between Despot and a 1580s Wallachian Prince, Petru Cercel, in that they both tried to Westernize their countries but were met with violent hostility from traditionalists. However, some Moldavians remained indebted to the deceased Prince. According to Kesterska Sergescu, a series of rebellions and mass flights in the later 1560s suggests that \"Jacob Heraclide's example did not go unheeded\". Historical topographers note the presence of a carved stone slab at Areni, which may indicate that the populace there still commemorated his death.\n\nDespite Azarie's pronouncements, Johann Sommer survived the persecutions and was still present in Moldavia by 1570, when he joined Ferenc Dávid's Unitarian movement in Transylvania. Cotnari's \"collegium\" continued to function as a Calvinist seminary until 1588, when Peter the Lame ceded it to the Catholics. As noted by literary historian D. Murărașu, it had failed in its apparent promise, that of sparking a \"cultural renaissance\" in Orthodox lands; scholar Traian Diaconescu also argues that, having \"planted the seed of Renaissance culture\", Despot still \"failed to realize that one cannot abruptly 'civilize' a country with only a few educated boyars, and illiterate masses.\" Despot's influence on the Catholic community of Iași County was sensed in the 1590s by Bernardo Quirini, the church inspector, who found that Catholics had kept the Lutheran books and even agreed with some Protestant doctrines. The new school was eventually moved out of Cotnari, and is today's Saint Joseph Institute.\n\nDespot had a fragmented legacy in visual arts and architecture. He ordered a Calvinist church to be built at Cotnari, but it remained unfinished. After taking Suceava, he ordered the battle of Verbia to be depicted on the (since deteriorated) walls of his princely palace. He also created here a book collection, including precious manuscript copies of the classics, such as a gilded-letter version of Cicero's works, from \"De re publica\" to \"Epistulae ad Atticum\". According to several authors, Despot's religious experiment may have also had an enduring impact on Romanian culture: his presumed patronage of some liturgical translations is credited by Papacostea for having given impetus to the emergence of literary Romanian. Scholar N. Drăganu believed that such translations not only existed, but influenced the printer Coresi. This theory was rejected by literary historian Alexandru Rosetti, who notes that Coresi was already active in 1559.\n\nIn 1563, Heraclid also had an indirect impact on the landscape and art of Lviv by lending money to his fellow Greek art patron, Konstanty Korniakt. His own rebuilding of Suceava came with an influx of German and Italian master craftsmen, including a goldsmith Wolfgang Midwischer. The state mint put out Despot's own version of the Lăpușneanu gold dinar and Ferdinand's silver \"Ort\", though its main products were bronze and copper pennies inspired by the Ottoman \"mangır\". Theodorescu believes that the portraits on his bullion coins can be attributed to Midwischer. They replicated Western Renaissance portraits, that proved highly influential, changing monetary symbolism for some 30 years.\n\nScholarly debates cover the interpretation of Despot's coinage, seals, and greater coat of arms. His imperial diploma of 1555 showed a regular \"party per cross\" shield with various charges, including a fish-with-ring, a temple, a bay tree, and a lion. In 1560, Despot also began using the Moldavian aurochs, which generally had a classical (affronty, \"inescutcheon\") representation. This symbolism became more complex during his reign, when a 14-quarters heraldic seal appeared, also including the aurochs and the \"Reichsadler\"; a charge of roses was also featured. The result is described as a \"pretentious heraldic amalgam\" by scholar Dan Cernovodeanu, who also notes its similarity with the personal arms of Charles V.\n\nPippidi identifies the three roses as canting arms of Rhodos, while the fish and \"Polycrates' ring\" stand for Samos. However, Cernovodeanu argues that Despot took his roses from the Mușatins' dynastic arms, also borrowing a modified \"fleur-de-lis\" and Pahonia (which became, respectively, a \"leaf-like\" pattern and a cross pattée). Other scholars believe that the roses allude to Despot's project of uniting Moldavia and Wallachia, or, contrarily, that they have a purely aesthetic function. A lion also appeared on dinars probably minted by Despot for circulation in an occupied Transylvania. These are largely based on the Hunyadi family arms, including a raven, and also feature a Patriarchal cross. The intent behind such symbolism may be political, or more pragmatically an attempt capitalize on the prestige of dinars from the old Hungarian Kingdom. All such imagery is altered in the final issues of coinage, where Despot uses the aurochs, the Wallachian bird, and the seven towers of Transylvania under a \"Reichsadler\".\n\nDespot's turbulent rule was the object of interest outside the Danubian Principalities. As Pippidi notes, by 1563 he had a \"European notoriety.\" Sommer's memoirs and Christian Schesaeus' poetry \"opened a line of \"belles-lettres\" works focusing on the Moldavian prince.\" In the 18th century, inspired by Leunclavius' essay on Despot, Jean-Baptiste de Recoles composed verse lamenting the killing of \"Jacques Héraclide\" by his \"irresponsible people\". Several historical sources associated with the Knights Hospitaller have enshrined the legend of a \"Basilicus Melitensis\", identified as a 15th- or 16th-century ruler \"of Wallachia\"; in Mifsud Bonnici's biographical dictionary, he appears as \"Basilio ta' Vallachia\". This tradition was also publicized in the 1990s by Maltese authors Charles A. Gauci and Vincent Zammit, who complied the various textual references and published reproductions of Basilicus' attributed portraits. According to Pippidi, the story itself is a distant retelling of Despot's career in Moldavia, while the portraits are part of the invented tradition: they depict the 17th-century Cosimo II de' Medici and the 18th-century Constantin Brâncoveanu; inscriptions identifying them as \"Basilicus\" were probably added before 1850. By the 1860s, the complete story of Despot's reign had been popularized in Malta by authors G. Trapani, G. A. Vassallo, and L. Calleja, the latter of whom also drew his portrait.\n\nDespot's project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia was only realized in 1859, with the \"United Principalities\". Here and in the successor Kingdom of Romania, interest in Heraclid's life was revived by a series of literary works. A \"Despot Vodă\" is one of six \"Romanian history dramas\" completed by Dimitrie Bolintineanu in the 1860s. A decade later, Samson Bodnărescu similarly focused on the rule of Lăpușneanu, inexplicably eliminating Despot from his retelling. Vasile Alecsandri was inspired by Bodnărescu to revisit the events with his own work of drama. Also called \"Despot Vodă\", it was first shown at the National Theater Bucharest in October, 1879. The work was loosely based on the historical narrative, and more heavily indebted to Victor Hugo. It divided the public between those who, like Ion Ghica, saw in it Alecsandri's masterpiece, and dissatisfied critics, such as Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. Lorga also viewed its take on Heraclid as \"exaggerated and false\" for failing to capture the \"sincere dreamer\". Literary historian Sebastian-Vlad Popa notes that, by the 1990s, the work was viewed as \"detestable\" in the theatrical community, and ridiculed as a \"wooden text\".\n\nAlso in the 1870s, Nicolae Scurtescu contributed a dramatic poem with the same subject and title. According to Iorga and Murărașu, it is just as valuable as Alecsandri's text. Popa notes a contrast, in that Scurtescu's writing is \"naturalistic\", its violence seeping into \"absurdity\". Theodor Codrescu's play \"Plăeșul Logofăt Mare\", dating from the same stage in literary development, was also set in Heraclid's Moldavia. Translated into Italian as \"Amore e Giustizia\", it was performed in 1897 at Naples. Despot is also the hero of 1920s short stories by Eug. Boureanu, and of two historical novels: Constantin Gane's \"Farmece\" (1933) and Romulus Seișanu's \"Aventuroasa viață a lui Despot-Vodă\" (1938). In the late 1930s, a successful effort was made to collect and publish all of Despot's own manuscripts on military matters, grouping copies from the national libraries of Poland and Austria, and from the Prussian Archives; another manuscript tract, signed by Christoporski, was discovered by Olteanu at Kórnik in the 1960s.\n"}

Produced by Jimmy Iovine, it is regarded as the group's commercial breakthrough, owing to the success of the single, \"Because the Night\" (co-written by Bruce Springsteen and Smith), which reached #13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #5 in the UK.\n\nThe first album released since Smith had suffered a neck injury while touring for \"Radio Ethiopia\", \"Easter\" has been called the most commercially accessible of the Patti Smith Group's catalogue. Unlike its two predecessors, \"Easter\" incorporated a diversity of musical styles, though still including classic rock and roll (\"25th Floor/High on Rebellion\", \"Rock N Roll Nigger\"), folk (\"Ghost Dance\"), spoken word (\"Babelogue\") and pop music (\"Because the Night\"). \"Easter\" is the only 1970s album of Smith's that does not feature Richard Sohl as part of the Patti Smith Group; in one interview at the time, Smith stated that Sohl was sick and this prevented him from participating in recording the album. Bruce Brody is credited as the keyboard player, Richard Sohl makes a guest appearance contributing keyboards to \"Space Monkey\", along with Blue Öyster Cult keyboardist Allen Lanier. The cover photograph is by Lynn Goldsmith and liner notes photography by Cindy Black and Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nIn addition to the religious allusion of its title, the album is replete with biblical and specifically Christian imagery. \"Privilege (Set Me Free)\" is taken from the British fame- and authoritarianism-satirizing film \"Privilege\"; its lyrics are adapted from Psalm 23. The LP insert reproduces a First Communion portrait of Frederic and Arthur Rimbaud, and Smith's notes for the song \"Easter\" invoke Catholic imagery of baptism, communion and the blood of Christ. A solitary hand-drawn cross is placed below the group member credits on the sleeve insert, and the last sentence of the liner notes is a quote from Second Epistle to Timothy 4:7 -- \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course ...\"\n\n\"Easter\" was highly acclaimed upon its release. Writing in \"Rolling Stone\", Dave Marsh called the album \"transcendent and fulfilled.\" In \"Creem\", Nick Tosches described it as \"an album of Christian obsessions, especially those of death and resurrection\", and called it Smith's \"best work.\" Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that \"the miracle is that most of these songs are rousing in the way they're meant to be.\" Lester Bangs, on the other hand, began his review of the album, \"Dear Patti, start the revolution without me\", and contended that while \"Horses\" had changed his life, \"Easter\" \"is just a very good album.\" \"Easter\" ranked at number 14 in \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop critics' poll of the best albums of 1978, while \"NME\" magazine ranked the album 46th best of the year.\n\nPatti Smith Group\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nTechnical\n\nDesign\n\nIn the insert with the original LP release (reproduced in the 1996 reissue), Smith's self-penned liner notes refer, among other things, to:\n"}

It is notable for being printed in vivid Technicolor long after the process had been abandoned in the United States. It was also the first Chinese film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, in 1990.\n\nThe film is a tragedy, focusing on the character of Ju Dou, a beautiful young woman who has been sold as a wife to Jinshan, an old cloth dyer.\n\nThe film was banned for a few years in China, but the ban has since been lifted. The Chinese government gave permission for its viewing in July 1992.\n\nThe story originates from a novel.\n\n\"Ju Dou\" takes place in the early 20th century in rural China. Yang Tianqing (Li Baotian) is returning from a trek to sell silk for his adoptive uncle, Yang Jinshan (Li Wei). Jinshan, whose trade is dyeing fabrics, is known for his cruelty. Jinshan has recently purchased a new wife, having beaten two previous wives to death after they failed to produce a son, the cruel irony being that Jinshan is in fact impotent.\n\nUpon meeting the wife, Ju Dou (Gong Li), Tianqing is enamored with her. At night, Jinshan tortures Ju Dou. Tianqing discovers Ju Dou's bathing area and spies on her. He does not know that Ju Dou knows he is there. Although Tianqing watches luridly at first, Ju Dou transforms the meaning of his gaze by exposing her bruises and sobbing, forcing him to see her as a human being rather than just a sexual object.\n\nSoon, the two are unable to control their passion any longer and engage in sex. When Ju Dou discovers she is pregnant with Tianqing's child, she and Tianqing pretend that the child is Jinshan's. Jinshan suffers a stroke that leaves him paralyzed from the waist down. After Ju Dou tells him the child is not his, he attempts to kill the child and burn down the house. Tianqing ties up Jinshan and hoists him in a barrel, leaving him dangling helplessly, a bitter bystander to his usurpation. Knowing that society would never accept her infidelity, Ju Dou goes to a nunnery to terminate another pregnancy. Jinshan continues to influence the life of the child he named Tianbai and when the child calls Jinshan \"Father,\" Jinshan accepts this as psychological revenge on his wife and nephew. One day, Jinshan falls into the dye vat and drowns and a funeral is held for him.\n\nSeven years later, Ju Dou and Tianqing still run the dye operation but Tianbai (Zheng Ji'an) is now a rage-filled teenager. Rumors of his parents' infidelities drive him to nearly kill a local gossiper. Ju Dou reveals the truth to her son in a fit of rage. She and Tianqing decide to have one last affair and grow weak after falling asleep in a cellar with little air. Upon discovering his parents resting in the cellar after their tryst, Tianbai drags them out - still weak and unable to awaken - and drowns Tianqing. Ju Dou then burns the mill down as the film ends.\n\nIn the original novel Tianqing is the biological nephew of Jinshan and the story itself is about incest by affinity. The makers of the film version decided not to use the incest angle. In the film, Tianqing and Jinshan are not biologically related, and Ju Dou only begins her relationship with Tianqing after learning that he and Jinshan are not related.\n\n\n\"Ju Dou\" was released by Miramax Films in March 1991.\n\n\n\n\"Ju Dou\" was initially released on DVD in the United States as an all-region disc on the Pioneer label, Geneon Entertainment, on June 29, 1999. The disc included English subtitles.\n\nThe film was re-released by Razor Digital Entertainment on February 14, 2006 as part of the new Zhang Yimou collection to capitalize on Zhang's recent international successes of \"Hero\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\". The new edition was Region 1 and included English, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese subtitles.

A short spell at The Hawthorns ended, when he was appointed first-team coach at Leeds United in July 2004,\n\nHe was appointed manager of Watford in March 2005 at the age of 34. The board backed their decision despite initial scepticism by Watford fans and the club entered a new era under Boothroyd. He managed to steer the club clear of relegation, with 1–0 victories over Stoke City and Rotherham United.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Boothroyd signalled his intentions by declaring that his aim for the forthcoming campaign would be promotion to the Premier League. As the season progressed, Boothroyd's side gained more and more confidence, and come the end of the season, had cemented a place in the play-offs. After overcoming Crystal Palace in the two-legged semi-final, Boothroyd's team came up against the club where he used to coach; Leeds United. Watford won 3–0 and claimed a place in the top league of English football. The rapid improvement in Watford's results in his first season in charge led to Boothroyd winning the Championship Manager of the Month in February 2006. Boothroyd continued as Watford manager for the duration of the 2006–07 season, but Watford finished 20th and were relegated. Nevertheless, Watford reached the FA Cup semi-finals, and Boothroyd was awarded a new three-year contract. In July 2006, he completed his UEFA Pro Licence in coaching.\n\nA good start to the 2007–08 season saw Watford twelve points clear at the top of the Championship after nineteen games. The good form saw Boothroyd named Championship Manager of the Month for October 2007 after Watford maintained a 100% record. However this could not be sustained and a poor run of form in second half of the season saw Boothroyd coming in for criticism for his team selections, direct style of play and dealings in the transfer market. One win in thirteen going into the last game of the season saw Watford in danger of missing out on a play-off spot altogether but a 1–1 draw against Blackpool was enough to secure sixth place on goal difference ahead of Wolverhampton Wanderers. In their play-off semi-final against Hull City Watford lost 2–0 at Vicarage Road and 4–1 at the KC Stadium.\n\nAfter missing out on an immediate return to Premier League, Boothroyd announced his intention to re-build the side for next season, and also change the team's style of play. However, he left Watford by mutual consent on 3 November 2008, after a home defeat to Blackpool.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Boothroyd was announced as the new manager of League One side Colchester United, succeeding Paul Lambert. In his first game as Colchester boss the team drew 0–0 with Southampton and the team won five of the first nine games in his charge. The first defeat came in his 10th game in a 2–1 defeat to Millwall.\n\nHis first signing as Colchester boss was the loan of John-Joe O'Toole and his first permanent signing was Kayode Odejayi. O'Toole was subsequently signed on a permanent basis and he also signed David Prutton from Leeds United, Ian Henderson from Ankaragücü and Morten Knudsen from Norway. Boothroyd added another loan signing with Franck Queudrue arriving on loan from Birmingham City.\n\nColchester, under Boothroyd, were in the top 6 for over half of the campaign. However, a poor run of form towards the end of the season which saw them win only 2 games of their last 14 games, and this saw them drop just outside the play-offs and finish in 8th position in League One. At this time, Boothroyd indicated his intentions to cull the squad and remove some \"dead wood\" to put together another promotion push. On 20 May 2010, Boothroyd left the club to take over Championship side Coventry City.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, Boothroyd was announced as the new manager of Championship side Coventry City, succeeding Chris Coleman. His first game in charge was on 7 August, in which Boothroyd led Coventry City to an opening day victory over Portsmouth with both goals from Freddy Eastwood.\n\nOn 14 March 2011, Boothroyd was sacked by Coventry City after a run of poor results, which saw the club win only once in sixteen league games.\n\nBoothroyd was appointed as manager of Northampton Town on 30 November 2011 on a one-year, rolling contract. Northampton had slipped to the foot of the League Two table, and six points from safety, before Boothroyd guided them to a 20th-place finish in the 2011–12 season. In the 2012–13 season, Northampton finished 6th, making the playoffs with 73 points. They beat Cheltenham Town 2-0 (on aggregate) in the two-legged semi-finals before losing 3–0 to Bradford City in the final at Wembley on 18 May 2013. On 21 December 2013, Boothroyd was sacked by Northampton after a 4–1 defeat by Wycombe Wanderers. The club were bottom of League Two.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, Boothroyd was appointed manager of the England national under-20 football team, but was replaced the following year in a reshuffle that saw him coach the under-19 side instead. He was re-appointed under-20s manager in August 2016, with Keith Downing taking charge of the under-19s.\n\nBoothroyd was named caretaker manager of the England national under-21 football team, after Gareth Southgate was named interim manager of the senior team. He would manage the side for their remaining 2017 UEFA Euro Championship qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Bosnia and Herzegovina. His first match in charge of the under-21s ended in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan, and the second, a 5–0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn 9 June 2018, Boothroyd managed England to success at the 2018 Toulon Tournament, beating Mexico 2–1 in the final.\n\n\n\n"}

A very common use is the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, where tumour deposits appear as \"punched-out\" lesions. The standard set of X-rays for a skeletal survey includes X-rays of the skull, entire spine, pelvis, ribs, both humeri and femora (proximal long bones). It is more effective than isotope scans at detecting bone involvement in multiple myeloma. Although significantly less sensitive than MRI, it is easier to include more bones. A study found that MRI of just the spine and pelvis would have detected 9% fewer cases of bone involvement than the more extensive skeletal survey which therefore remains the standard method.\n\nSkeletal surveys are also used with suspected non-accidental injury in children (CE guidelines state that 19 images of the child are taken.) These are reported on by a consultant paediatric radiologist and often copies are made. Non-accidental injury is suspected if a child sustains an injury where the clinical findings are not consistent with the explanation given for the injury, such as a spiral fracture in a child who is not yet walking. \n\nA skull CT is also done in connection with the radiographs if the child is under one year old or, if the child is older, where there is a clinical requirement (perioribtal ecchymosis, for example) as to rule out abusive head trauma.\n\nThe results of a skeletal survey may be used in a court of law as evidence of child abuse.\n"}

Thanlyin Township comprises 17 quarters and 28 village tracts. It is home to the largest port in the country, Thilawa port.\n\nThanlyin first came to prominence in the 15th century as the main port city of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, replacing a silted up Bago port. In 1539, the city became part of the Kingdom of Taungoo. In 1599, the city fell to the Rakhine forces led by the Portuguese mercenary Filipe de Brito e Nicote, who was made governor of the city. De Brito declared independence from his nominal Rakhine masters in 1603, defeated the invading Rakhine navy in 1604 and 1605, and successfully established Portuguese rule over Syriam or Sirião -as it was called back then- under the Portuguese viceroy of Goa. In 1613, Burmese king Anaukpetlun recaptured the city, and executed Brito by impalement, a punishment reserved for defilers of Buddhist temples.\n\nThanlyin remained the major port of the Taungoo kingdom until the mid-18th century. In the 1740s, Thanlyin was made the base of the French East India Company for their help in the Mon's reestablishment of Hanthawaddy Kingdom. The arrangement lasted until 1756 when King Alaungpaya of Konbaung dynasty captured the city. From then on, the importance has shifted to Yangon across the river, which Alaungpaya founded just a year earlier.\n\nThanlyin became part of the British Empire in 1852 after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The British made the city into the oil refinery center of the country in the early 20th century to process the oil shipped from central Burma. The refinery was destroyed during World War II. The Thanlyin refinery was rebuilt in 1957, and underwent expansion in 1979 with Japanese assistance. In 1979 a pipeline was completed between Syriam and the Mann oilfield.\n\nSince the 1990s, the city has undergone major changes. Thanlyin was finally connected to Yangon by road in 1993 when the Thanlyin Bridge was built. In the late 1990s, Thilawa Port was built to handle the container ships away from Yangon's ports. The city is home to a national university in Myanmar Maritime University, and local universities in the University of East Yangon and Technological University, Thanlyin. The city's population has increased from 43,000 in 1983 to 123,000 in 1996.\n\nThanlyin is connected to the country's fledgling highway network. The Thanlyin Bridge carries Highway 6, which links Yangon with the Thilawa port and Thanlyin Industrial Zone. The Thanlyin Bridge 2, under construction since 2003, will link Thanlyin to Highway 2, the Yangon-Mandalay highway. River ferries to the Irrawaddy delta over the Twante Canal are available from Yangon's passenger ports.\n\nThilawa port is the largest deep water sea port in the country, and handles the majority of the shipped imports and exports to/from the country.\n\nThanlyin is home to Myanmar Maritime University, one of the most selective universities in Burma. Since the early 2000s, students from Thanlyin and surrounding suburbs have to attend local universities: the University of East Yangon for liberal arts and sciences, Technological University, Thanlyin for engineering and Co-operative University, Thanlyin for business.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2161154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161154", "title": "Paluxy River", "text": "Paluxy River\n\nThe Paluxy River, also known as the Paluxy Creek, is a river in the U.S. state of Texas. It is a tributary of the Brazos River. It is formed by the convergence of the \"North Paluxy River\" and the \"South Paluxy River\" near Bluff Dale, Texas in Erath County and flows a distance of before joining the Brazos just to the east of Glen Rose, Texas in south central Somervell County.\n\nIt is best known for numerous dinosaur footprints found in its bed near Glen Rose at the Dinosaur Valley State Park. The Paluxy River became famous for controversy in the early 1930s when locals found dinosaur and supposed human footprints in the same rock layer in the Glen Rose Formation, which were widely publicized as evidence against the geological time scale and in favor of young-Earth creationism. However, these anachronistic \"human\" footprints have been determined to be mistaken interpretation or hoaxes.\n\nMany dinosaur trackways and footprints have been discovered in the riverbed, some as early as 1908. Most tracks in the area were found in Cretaceous limestone. One of the most well-known is the chase sequence, which contains the tracks of a herd of sauropods and at least one theropod following the herd. The tracks have been attributed to \"Sauroposeidon\" and \"Acrocanthosaurus\", respectively. Other well-known and studied sites containing similar trackways are the Taylor Site, the Blue Hole Ballroom, and the Blue Hole Parlor. In 1938, paleontologist Roland Bird discovered tracks in the Paluxy River. The documenting and publishing of these findings made the site famous and attracted the attention of researchers, some of whom began to claim that some of the tracks were human footprints.\n\nThe Paluxy River trackways have drawn much attention from supporters of creation and evolution alike. Some claimed that some footprints were made by mythological giant humans who lived at the same time as the dinosaurs who created the other tracks. John Whitcomb, Henry Morris, John Morris, and Carl Baugh all are current or former proponents of the human footprint theory. Though there are some that still cite the trackways as evidence against the geological time scale, the general consensus is that all of the human tracks were either fake or interpreted incorrectly.\n\nSome of the tracks were fake, carved by locals to sell during the Great Depression. These footprints do not represent the way human footprints would look in mud; they also do not accurately reflect the changes in the way giant humans would walk as a result of their size.\nOther footprints were genuine tracks, but showed features inconsistent with human footprints. Supporters of the human footprint theory claimed that the tracks showed authentic mud “push-ups” and that the time period for the human and dinosaur trackways had to be the same as the trails intersected. In 1986, Glen Kuban conducted research on the trackways. He found that most tracks formed a wide “V” at the end and showed grooves in places that were not consistent with those in a human footprint. Kuban determined that the tracks were made by bipedal dinosaurs with three toes. These particular tracks showed the dinosaur walking on the soles of its feet rather than on its toes, as is usually found in tracks. Evidence based in human anatomy also refutes the claim that the footprints are of human origin. The foot length measurements were used to calculate approximate heights of the humans; the pace and stride lengths do not match these calculated heights, making it highly unlikely that the tracks are human in origin. The measurements do fit the known values for bipedal dinosaurs.\n\nOther theories include random natural and erosion patterns resembling human footprints, trace fossils of burrows of small invertebrates, severely eroded or partial tracks, and other impressions known to occur in dinosaur trackways caused by different body parts.\n\nIn 2014, a digital model was made of the chase sequence trackways from photographs taken in 1940 by Bird. The photographs were used to create the digital reconstruction of the tracks as they were in 1940, before excavations. Though the reconstruction shows high variations in quality in different parts of the model, it provides a good demonstration of historical photogrammetry used to model deteriorated sites and specimens.\n"}

Created by Chuck Dixon as an adversary of Batman, the character first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #654, published in December 1992. Named for the character's gimmick for military strategy and prowess with small arms, stories involving the character often include historic military references and themes.\n\nInitially portrayed as a dangerously psychopathic, murderous child, the tone of the General was changed by Dixon himself for later appearances. Return appearances featured the character in issues of \"Robin\" during the mid-1990s, in which Dixon portrayed the character as pompous and childish, rather than maliciously insane. Although still occasionally dangerous and lethal, the graphic violence of the character's criminal behavior was also toned down.\n\nThe character experienced a prolonged period of obscurity after 1997, lasting over ten years, until Fabian Nicieza chose to revamp the character for the concluding story arc of the \"Robin\" comic book series in the final months of 2008. With Nicieza's intention being to establish the character as an archenemy for Tim Drake, the General was once again characterized as a major threat in the \"Batman family\" pantheon of villains. Recast as a new version of another obscure character, Anarky, Armstrong was also re-characterized with a new \"Anarky\" themed costume.\n\nThe General was created by Chuck Dixon in 1992.\nUlysses Hadrian Armstrong is a psychotic child with the mind of a military genius. Bored with his life at a military school, he reads books about military history. Ulysses later escapes his school, burning down the school and killing everyone inside; these are acts of arson and mass murder, committed to avoid alerting authorities to his escape. He goes to Gotham City to recruit small-time gang members into a makeshift \"army\". Utilizing military skills, Armstrong's reputation gains him the nickname \"the General\". Continuing a campaign to become a powerful crime boss of Gotham, the General conquers and absorbs enemy gangs into a sizable force. Laying siege to a police station with the intent of capturing the storage room full of guns and illegal drugs, with which to fund future activities, he is confronted by Batman. Once captured by Batman, the General's undisciplined army scatters in fear, and the General himself is sent to a youth detention center.\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the General appeared in a total of three story arcs in issues of the \"Robin\" comic book series.\n\nThe General manipulated delusional homeless derelict, Julie Caesar, who believed himself to be the historical Julius Caesar.\n\nThe General teamed up with Toyman, but this partnership ended in mutual betrayal.\n\nThe General was given control as commander-in-chief of a country's military.\n\nThe General appeared at the end of 2008 in \"Robin\" #177, the \"Search for a Hero\" storyline that deals with the Batman R.I.P. aftermath, \"Battle for the Cowl\". Within the storyline, he is revealed to be disguised as Red Robin.\n\nAfter a very long absence, the General has returned to Gotham City, having aged several years, grown several feet and has become a more formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He physically appears closer in age to Robin and Spoiler. He has for reasons yet unknown been hired by Spoiler to gather information about the Gang Wars, and find a possible solution to them. He continues to hold a grudge against Robin and betrays Spoiler. Spoiler survives a gunshot to the shoulder, and then distracts him long enough to get the drop on him and escape.\n\nHe comes into possession of the Red Robin costume worn by Jason Todd, and uses it as part of a campaign of psychological warfare against Tim Drake. More formidable than ever, he's revealed to be holding Lonnie Machin hostage and to have commandeered the latter's identity as Anarky. Where Machin's approach as Anarky had been to cause social change, Armstrong's approach bordered more on psychotic and meaningless acts of chaos and destruction.\n\nArmstrong manages to catch Robin in his warehouse, yet Robin escapes through unknown means, but not without sustaining serious burns to his head. Soon after, a final confrontation ensues, where Anarky attempts to kill all of Gotham City's gangs, so as to create more violence. The combined efforts of Robin, Spoiler, Commissioner Gordon, Officer Harper and the Gotham gangs results in Armstrong's defeat; however, not without a price. In order to take the edge off of Armstrong, Robin asked Officer Harper to bring the Armstrong Family to confront Ulysses. While the action worked, Armstrong caused a bomb to explode, killing his brother and sister in the blast. Armstrong blames Robin for their deaths.\n\nUlysses returns to continuity after \"Flashpoint\" event during the Detective Comics storyline \"Rise of the Batmen\", a part of DC's Rebirth relaunch. This version of the character is a teenage genius who works for a military organization known as The Colony, which models itself after Batman and his methods. Ulysses' job within the Colony is to reverse engineer Batman's equipment, as well as observe the Bat-Family. This version of the character is shown to be cheerful yet sociopathic, gleefully offering to show Batman footage of the more gruesome missions that the Colony has undertaken.\n\nThe General is a military and strategic genius. He has vast knowledge of military history, and his careful planning are what earned him the respect of his henchmen. Sometimes he fools adults into false senses of security in order to attack them. Sometimes he tricks adults into letting him control armies.\n\nGrowing up, he gains a muscular build and a lesser degree of martial arts knowledge, not nearly enough to best seasoned fighters like Robin, but quite formidable nevertheless.\n\nHe retains his penchant for historical weapons, and in his brief stint as the \"Red Robin\" he's shown using a Mauser as his sidearm of preference.\n\nHe likes to play dress up, changing several costumes and identities in his career. Starting from a simple \"military themed\" garb, he then adopted the \"Red Robin\" suit, discarded from a dimension hopping Jason Todd, using the Bat-Family themed identity to pave off for his return as the new Anarchy.\n\nAs Anarchy he uses a modified version of the original Anarky suit, adapted to fit his broader and sturdier physical build and with an \"angrier\" mask.\n\nBoth as Red Robin and as Anarky, Adrian is shown able to create and set complex explosive traps, drawing Tim Drake in a mined warehouse and managing to wound him seriously. As Anarky he wears a special cane with remote controller trigger, making him able to detonate explosives carefully hidden through the battlefield.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter indexes\n"}

Due to complexity and set up time it was decided a computer format would be more suitable. The first Extreme Warfare on the PC (now called \"Extreme Warfare 1\") was programmed in 1995 in QBasic. This game was a simple simulator, where one could decide what matches were to take place and who was going to win them but also involved some simple financial elements, such as the wages of wrestlers. Due to limitations in QBasic, Ryland moved the series over to Turbo Pascal where further incarnations of the game were created, including: Extreme Warfare 2, Extreme Warfare 2000, Extreme Warfare 2001, Extreme Warfare 2002, Extreme Warfare 5000, Extreme Warfare 6000, Extreme Warfare 7500, and Extreme Warfare 9000.\n\nEach version of the game was an upgrade of the previous and continually built on the ideas of booking matches and running the business side of a professional wrestling promotion. After release of EW 9000, a game called \"Promotion Wars\" was released by fellow British programmer Adam Jennings, taking some inspiration from both Extreme Warfare 9000 and Championship Manager. After the game's release, some of Extreme Warfare's fan base shifted their interest over to this game when released in October 2000.\n\nOn April 1, 2001, \"Extreme Warfare Deluxe\" (EWD) was released. It was the first game in a while to be built by scratch instead of an upgrade of the previous games.\n\nEWD expanded on the previous games in terms of the actual game world. The game world was expanded in that everyone in the database can now be hired by any promotion, unlike previous games in which WWF superstars can only be hired by the WWF, with the same applying for WCW and ECW. This helped to bring more competition between promotions, which now had their own artificial intelligence. Also included in EWD was the match report screen which featured stats about the match quality, crowd reaction and worker effort of the match along with an overall rating. This setup would end up being the basis of all match report screens in later games in the series up to and including TEW 2004.\n\nInitially, Ryland stated that Deluxe was going to be the final game of the series but shortly afterwards, he changed his mind and began work on a new Extreme Warfare game. With the limitations of Turbo Pascal now pushing the game to the limit, Ryland decided in October 2001 to start work on a brand new game in the EW series.\n\n\"Extreme Warfare Revenge\" (EWR) was released on June 15, 2002. Now programmed in Visual Basic, the series now took a Windows style interface. One of the most significant changes this game took to the series was the fact that everything on a wrestling event is under the control of the user. In previous games in the series, angles, finishes and (in EWD) interviews were randomly created. This also coincided with the new feud system that was to count the matches, angles and interview victories between the workers involved. The match reports also took a slight change, featuring reviews of the matches from such Internet columnists as Scott Keith instead of a straight play-by-play style. However, the report style would revert to its old style in TEW 2004.\n\nAnother major feature that changed the way the game was played was the way the game world was represented. Unlike the previous games in which it was mostly focused on the major promotions such as the WWF, WCW, and ECW the promotion size feature meant many promotions in North America could now be included from the global sized promotions like WWE to the cult sized promotions like ROH to a mere backyard federation.\n\nFrom June 2002 to July 2003, the game has had some significant upgrades and new versions of the game were released. Some of these changes included changes to the TV timeslot system where the more further away from a prime time slot a televised event is shown, the fewer segments the user gets to book with. The Internet feature was also increased to include a website based on the independent promotions, a website based on backstage gossip and a website for your promotion. Relationships between workers were added to help bring in backstage politics where people are more willing put over their friends and less with their enemies. Eventually workers could also be in multiple tag teams with a statistic for experience which increases with each match fought together. Gimmicks were then added for wrestlers to use which would affect the overness of a worker over how strong that gimmick was. More changes were made to adapt to the independent promotions. This included multiple open contracts for workers, enabling them to work in up to three promotions and the ability of workers to go on Japanese tours, affecting the booking of cards. The optional ability of viewing a wrestler's picture was also added later in the game's production.\n\nDue to the size of the game, Ryland felt that in order to include new features and upgrades a completely new game would have to be programmed from scratch. With this task taking quite a lot of his time, Ryland decided to turn his hobby into a commercial venture, signing a contract with simulator game company .400 Software Studios to produce a new commercial game.\n\n\"Total Extreme Warfare 2004\" (TEW 2004) was released on March 31, 2004 under .400 Software Studios. The game was distributed by downloading on the Internet after purchase, (using ELicense). A full working trial was also available for download which originally would expire after a single day but was replaced by a trial that makes the user able to play one game month unlimited times.\n\nAlong with a new professional layout, the game had more features. While the previous games only focused on the wrestling scene of North America (Japan was featured in later versions of EWR but not playable), TEW 2004 expanded the world to include such areas as Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia. With this, each worker's overness was now expanded from EWR's single value to a series of values depending on areas in the world. The AI was changed in that now the user could now see what matches other promotions have booked, other promotions' financial details and what deals they have made. More contract clauses such as medical coverage and travel expenditure being included, contracts deal decisions were now made over time rather than immediate. Inspired by some fans playing against each other using WWE brands by sending files to each other through the Internet, a multi-player feature was added to make users play against each other with different promotions. Booking was also improved in that not only could the user edit the card more easily, the booking was now time-based, meaning such anomalies as booking 11-hour-long Iron Man matches on a two-hour shows would no longer be possible. The game was also more customisable than before with new editing modes as Create-A-Match and Create-A-Gimmick.\n\nDue to the problem of copyright issues by going commercial, the series turned from using stats of the real wrestling world to a fictitious wrestling world called the \"CornellVerse\". This world is named after the character of Tommy Cornell, one of the most influential people and best wrestlers in the \"CornellVerse\", based on a character Ryland had created a few years earlier while participating in e-federations.\n\nOn June 14, 2004, the game was renamed \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2004\" to help distinguish the new TEW series from the earlier EWR series.\n\nDue to undisclosed reasons, Ryland moved from .400 Software Studios to another simulator game company, Grey Dog Software. His first game created there however was not another Extreme Warfare game, instead the first Wrestling Spirit game.\n\nDue to .400 Software Studio's closure on January 1, 2006, the game was taken off the market permanently. There are currently no plans to make this game freeware or shareware.\n\nThe sequel to TEW 2004, \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2005\" (TEW 2005) was released on October 6, 2005 under Grey Dog Software. A demo was also released in advance on September 29, 2005, allowing the user to play one game month just like previous demos. TEW 2005 included some more new features. Advance booking was one example which helped to promote upcoming big events. Televised shows also improved, bringing both competition to the shows with non-wrestling shows along with multiple television deals around the world for one show. The pay-per-view feature was now very similar to television in that there's now a list of pay-per-view providers which the user must make a deal with to get their pay-per-view provided. A momentum meter was also added to the wrestlers to bring in more realism in that if they give great matches, cut good interviews and participate in angles, it will increase and thus gain more overness. This helped to prevent the user from booking the same over people all the time and expect good ratings. The booking also improved in that the match purpose feature from EWR has returned and enhanced. The user must now talk to road agents about how the match has to be set up, including ways of putting people over, burying a worker and the way an actual match needs to be performed. TEW 2005 also made more features customizable with its new editable statistics for angles, storylines, locations and injuries. Its angle editor consisted of many different types such as interviews to beatdowns to celebrations and uses up to six people to participate in various roles. The storyline editor takes these angles and places them in an order the booker will need to comply to. The storyline editor was created by Phil Parent, using Georges Polti's book \"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations\" as an inspiration. Also included was the \"grades\" feature. Instead of having an exact view of the stats each wrestler has along with changes, a more realistic grade feature was instead added to make the user rely on instinct for crucial decisions.\n\nTEW 05 became freeware on July 1, 2009.\n\n\"Total Extreme Wrestling 2007\" (TEW 2007) was officially released on December 29, 2006, with a number of new features. Whereas both TEW2004 and TEW2005 were written from scratch, TEW 2007 was being built on top of TEW 2005's source code. There were many new features, such as the ability to customise merchandise and a large amount of new contract types (short-term, etc.).\n\nA new installment of the series, \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2008\" (TEW 2008), was announced on the Grey Dog Software website on January 1, 2008. The game is largely based on TEW 2007, but Ryland made more than 100 changes and additions. The game allows players to import and convert their TEW 2007 databases. The game was released on June 7, 2008. The demo for the game was released on June 1, 2008.\n\nIn late 2009, it was announced that \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2010\" (TEW 2010) would be released in early 2010. Some of the new features announced included a revamp of backstage morale, and several changes to improve the interface and to reduce the amount of time it takes to navigate through the game and to book a show.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, Adam Ryland released the demo to Total Extreme Wrestling 2010. The official release happened on January 25, 2010.\n\nAt the end of July, it was announced that \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2013\" (TEW 2013) would be released in December 2012. Some of the new features announced included an Autobooker, Fog Of War, Tribute Shows, Shoot Interviews, Legacies, and several other changes to help either make the game more realistic, and opened up more options in the database\n\nTotal Extreme Wrestling 2013 was released on December 16, 2012, with the demo version available on December 9.\n\nOn January 8, 2016, it was announced that \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2016\" (TEW 2016) was in development. The developer's journal announced that the game would feature elements that would add more realism and would also include things such as backstage cliques. On April 1, 2016, the last day of developer's journal updates, TEW 2016 was announced to have a demo release date of April 25, with a full release on May 2. While in previous versions of the demo, the player could only play through January of the game's titular year, it was announced that TEW 2016's demo would allow players to play through both January and February of any year.\n\nOn December 8, 2018, it was announced that \"Total Extreme Wrestling 2020\" (TEW 2020) is in development with an estimate release of April 2020. The announcement stated that Ryland had completely rewritten the code before reinserting older features to make the game \"effectively a much sharper, quicker, more intuitive, better quality piece of work\" and promised that TEW 2020 would be \"the biggest jump forward in terms of quality the series has ever seen\".\n\nThe developer's journal, beginning on the day of the announcement, was split into multiple phases, the first phase being announcements of new and returning features which had already been added beginning December 10, 2018 and ending July 12, 2019, while the second phase, which began July 29, 2019 and is currently ongoing, is a \"live\" journal discussing features currently being worked on and the current level of completion of the default game world, \"The Cornellverse\". Some of the highly-requested features added include playing as a company's developmental territory and giving the player more control over house shows.\n\nAnother feature introduced was that of attributes, replacing the old \"personality\" and \"lifestyle\" systems. In an interview with My Games Lounge, Ryland said that \"it was nice to do a spring clean of the code\" as re-writing the code is what allowed him to add so many new features.\n\nOn March 28, 2020 the release date of TEW 2020 was announced as April 23 for the trial version, and April 30 for the full retail version. On April 25, the game's release date was pushed back to May 14. \n\n\n"}

It is based on 1972's The Godfather. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan in the title role alongside Abhishek Bachchan as his younger son, along with Kay Kay Menon, Katrina Kaif, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Anupam Kher, Supriya Pathak and Tanisha Mukherjee. It is the first installment of \"Sarkar film series\" \n\"Sarkar Raj\", released on 6 June 2008, and \"Sarkar 3\", released on 12 May 2017, the film was archived at the American Academy of Motion Pictures library. The blockbuster film was premièred at the New York Asian Film Festival.\n\nSubhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan), who is known by his followers as Sarkar, lives in Mumbai. The opening scenes show a rape victim's father (Veerendra Saxena) approaching Sarkar for justice (which the corrupt law and order system has failed to deliver) which Sarkar promptly establishes by having the rapist beaten up by his henchmen. His son, Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon), plays a sleazy producer who is more interested in the film actress Sapna (Priyanka Kothari) than his wife Amrita (Rukhsaar Rehman). Sarkar's other, more upright son, Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan), returns from the United States with his love Pooja (Katrina Kaif) after completing his education there. Pooja's doubts about Sarkar's image cause Shankar, who firmly believes in his father's righteousness, to break up with her.\n\nOne day, a Dubai-based don, Rasheed (Zakir Hussain) tries to strike a deal with Sarkar; he promptly refuses on moral grounds and also forbids him from doing it himself. Rasheed tries to eliminate Sarkar's supremacy with the help of Selvar Mani (Kota Srinivasa Rao), Sarkar's former associate, MLA Vishram Bhagat and Swami Virendra (Jeeva). Meanwhile, they trap Sarkar by assassinating a righteous, upright, Ahinsa political leader and an outspoken critic of Sarkar, Motilal Khurana (Anupam Kher), and frame Sarkar for the murder. Everyone, including Vishnu, believes that Sarkar is guilty but Shankar has deep faith in his father. Sarkar gets arrested and is imprisoned. Shankar now takes over the position of Sarkar temporarily. On learning of a plot to murder his father in prison, he approaches the police commissioner (Anant Jog) and asks him to arrange stronger security for his father, only for the commissioner to mock Shankar and his father beside not providing protection. Shankar gets a feeling that the police commissioner wants Sarkar to get murdered. Shankar and Khansaab, one of Sarkar's men, try to ask Selvar Mani for help to prevent possible murder, but Mani ultimately betrays them when he reveals that he is in an alliance with Rasheed. Rasheed prepares to kill Shankar and Khansaab but only Khansaab is killed when he decides to sacrifice himself for Shankar. By the time Shankar reaches the prison and appropriate action is taken, the attempt on Sarkar's life is already made. Sarkar is later acquitted. He remains bedridden as Shankar takes on Sarkar's enemies.\n\nMeanwhile, Selvar Mani, Swami, Vishram and Rasheed try to convince Vishnu to murder Sarkar. Vishnu was previously thrown out of Sarkar's house because he had murdered the actor who was having an affair with Sapna. Vishnu returns home pretending to have repented. When he approaches Sarkar in the dark of the night with the intent of murdering him, Shankar foils his plan and later kills him. Shankar eliminates Rasheed, Vishram and Selvar Mani. He also succeeds in making Swami his puppet. Shankar has also realised that Chief Minister Madan Rathore (Deepak Shirke) was really behind everything; Rasheed and everyone else were merely pawns. This results in legal action against the Chief Minister. The closing scenes show a woman approaching Shankar for justice to a fake encounter of her husband by the police and calling Shankar the Sarkar, while Subhash is busy with family.\n\n\"Sarkar\" was superhit at the box office and was greeted very well by critics. Critics liked the way the movie indigenised \"The Godfather\" and introduced a political angle to it. The actors, particularly the trio of Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Kay Kay Menon, were lavished with praise for their controlled yet intense performances. Abhishek Bachchan in particular, was rewarded for his portrayal as a son who is inexperienced but enters an unknown world so as to save his father. He won the following awards:\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Sarkar\" consists of 10 songs composed by Bapi-Tutul & Prasanna Shekhar the lyrics of which were penned by Sandeep Nath.\n\nRaja Sen of Rediff said that the film \"had the potential to be Great. It turns out to be passable.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised the movie saying that, \"SARKAR is without doubt an interesting film. The story, its execution, the performances, the drama… The outcome leaves you spellbound.\" but criticized the slow pacing of the film and gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5. William Thomas of Empire Online gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 saying that, \"Constructed with flair and crackling with intelligence, this is one of the most edgiest and grittiest releases to come out of Bollywood in years.\"\n\nA Telugu remake, titled Rowdy was made replacing the background of Marathi politics with that of South Indian factionism. Veteran actor Mohan Babu reprised the role portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan while his son Vishnu Manchu reprised the role played by Abhishek Bachchan. Rowdy released on 4 April 2014 to positive reviews from critics but was a moderate commercial success, grossing approximately Rs 8 Crores in its full run.\n\nA sequel titled Sarkar Raj was released on 6 June 2008 with Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan (who reprise their roles from the original) and new entrant Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Supriya Pathak, Tanisha Mukherjee and Ravi Kale also reappeared in their respective roles from Sarkar. The film released on 6 June 2008, was critically and commercially successful.\n"}

The cave is named after nearby Holy Cross Church in Podlož. The cave is particularly noted for its chain of over 45 subterranean lakes of emerald green water. With 45 species of organisms, some not discovered until 2000, Cross Cave is the fourth-largest cave ecosystem in the world in terms of biodiversity. The cave was first documented in 1832, but the part of the cave that includes lakes and stream passages was first explored by Slovene cavers in 1926. Over two thousand cave bear bones have been found in the cave.\n\nAt Calvary (, the best-known symbol of Cross Cave), the cave splits into two branches: the Muds () to the north and the Variegated Passage () to the northeast. The passage through the Muds is more difficult, and so most visitors choose to continue through the Variegated Passage, which requires the use of small boats. Cross Cave continues into New Cross Cave (). In the direction from the entrance to the cave, the Variegated Passage is the left gallery of Cross Cave at the confluence with the Muds at Cavalry. The access requires the use of boats. Part of the way along the Variegated Passage is a side gallery named the Matjaž Passage (), and it contains several large columns. Continuing along the Variegated Passage, visitors enter the Crystal Mountain (), the largest room in the cave.

The character is usually depicted as an ally of Wolverine. The character first appeared in \"Wolverine\" Vol. 2, Issue 37 in an inanimate state suspended in tank of gelatin. Elsie-Dee is a sentient android. Her name is a pun on LCD, indicating her artificial origins.\n\nElsie-Dee was created along with her counterpart, Albert (a robot double of Wolverine), by Donald Pierce. These androids were designed to kill Wolverine. The Wolverine double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5-year-old girl) was supposed to trap Wolverine in a burning building where she would detonate with sufficient force to kill him.\n\nThe plan fails because one of Pierce's henchmen, Bonebreaker, accidentally gives Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce's automatons was capable of, instead of the intended intellect of a 5-year-old. As a result, Elsie-Dee eventually finds a way to defuse her detonation sequence. She also enhances the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even hers. They meet and battle Wolverine in the skies over New York. She and her counterpart decide that he was a noble person and did not deserve to die and consequently abandon their mission.\n\nAt one point Elsie-Dee is responsible for the reviving of Sabretooth. The murderous mutant had been left for dead in the sewers and her casual misstep forced his neck back into place, allowing his healing factor to finish the job.\n\nThe two robots risk their existences several times for each other and for Wolverine. At some point they travel in time and have several adventures, eventually gaining an AI stealth bomber and the companionship of the 'Hunter in Darkness'. Hunter is a white-haired wolf-like creature whom Wolverine twice rescues from confinement, which Elsie-Dee dubs \"Puppy\".\n\nThe trio help stop the murderous \"Adversary\" hundreds of years ago in the wilds of North America. Albert gains a leadership role with local Indians. They live there for some time and 'Puppy' leaves his new friends to go live with his own kind.\n\nDuring the \"Hunt for Wolverine\" storyline, Elsie-Dee is mentioned to be missing as Albert asks Daredevil what he did with her. Before Daredevil can answer, Albert is deactivated by the weapons used by Nur, Misty Knight, and Cypher.\n\nThough appearing to be a 5-year-old girl, Elsie-Dee had abilities far exceeding her appearance. She was very strong, could interface directly with computers, and had an intellect greater than her designer, Donald Pierce, who was himself a genius in the field of robotics.\n\nIn \"Exiles\" #85 the Timebroker gathered multiple teams – each full of Wolverines – to finish the repairing of the broken realities. The last team he gathered consisted a version of Albert and Elsie-Dee from Earth-50211. The first mission of the team was to kill an evil Magneto (female) who melded with that world's Wolverine, Quicksilver (female), Scarlet Warlock (male Scarlet Witch), and Mesmero, and already captured (and manipulated) dozens of Wolverines from the previous teams. When they've arrived they were ambushed immediately and both of them were captured, as well as two of their teammates.\n\nElsie Dee is a character in the video game \"\".\n\n"}

It is located at the intersection of 14th Street and Grand Boulevard on the east side of the Power & Light District. The arena's naming rights partner is Sprint Corporation, which is headquartered in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nSprint Center opened on October 10, 2007, and a concert by Elton John held three days later was the arena's first event. The center is owned by the city of Kansas City, Missouri. The arena seats over 19,000 people and has 72 suites. Sprint Center has effectively replaced Kemper Arena, which was built in 1974 just a few miles away in the southern portion of the West Bottoms neighborhood. Additionally, the College Basketball Experience, which includes the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, is connected to and directly north of Sprint Center.\n\nSprint Center hosted the Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament in 2008 and has done so every year since 2010. It also hosted the first and second rounds of the 2009 and 2013 NCAA Men's Tournaments, as well as the regional rounds of the 2017 NCAA Men's Tournament and the 2010 NCAA Women's Tournament; it is also scheduled to host a 2019 NCAA Men's Division I regional.

The final design, by the Downtown Arena Design Team (a collaboration of the architectural firms Populous, 360 Architecture, Rafael Architects, and Ellerbe Becket), was selected in August 2005. The construction manager responsible for the entire project was M.A. Mortenson Company, based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThe complete exterior glass facade system, all metal panels for the adjacent buildings and all accessory metal cladding was custom designed, detailed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems, the Des Moines, Iowa based glazing contractor who installed the building envelope. In total there are approximately 13,000 m² (139,932 square feet) of double insulated glass and 5,000 m² (53,820 square feet) painted aluminum curtain wall panels. In addition there are roughly 200 tons of system profiles and accessories. All of the 2,404 individual glass units on the main building were produced sequentially and completely assembled prior to shipping. The 5 million lbs of rebar used in construction was detailed, fabricated and supplied by The Carter-Waters Corporation of Kansas City. The arena also features a work of public art, The Moons, by artist Chris Doyle, commissioned by the Kansas City Municipal Arts Commission (KCMAC).\n\nThe Big 12 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was held at Sprint Center in 2008, marking the tournament's return to Kansas City after three years in Dallas and Oklahoma City. After returning to Oklahoma City in 2009, the Sprint Center again hosted the tournament in 2010 and 2011. It is scheduled to be the tournament host site through 2020. Because of Kansas City's proximity to the University of Kansas in neighboring Lawrence, Jayhawk fans who fill the arena for Big 12 Tournament games refer to the arena as \"Allen Fieldhouse East\" in reference to Kansas' home arena in Lawrence, Allen Fieldhouse. However, due to Iowa State's recent Big 12 Tournament success – winning four tournament championships in a six-year span – and their fanbase's huge migration to the annual event, the Sprint Center is referred to by Iowa State fans as \"Hilton South\", after Iowa State's home venue, Hilton Coliseum.\n\nThe arena also houses the College Basketball Experience and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, which is at 1301 Grand Boulevard and connected to Sprint Center.\n\nThe arena's exterior is made of glass, and the interior has a 360-degree LED video screen. This facility allows Kansas City to draw most concerts touring the United States.\n\nSprint Center opened on time and on budget on October 10, 2007 at 10:10 am. A tour lasted from 10:10 am – 10:10 pm for those who wanted to see it to grab a ticket at the box office. The tour consisted of the College Basketball Experience, two open concession stands: \"Taco Taco\" and \"Oak Street Pizza\"; a free drink from UMB Bank and other free items: a UMB Bank cup, a UMB Bank frisbee, and a UMB Bank ice scraper. UMB Bank is the only ATM in the new arena because it is a Sprint Center Founding Partner along with Farmland, The University of Kansas Hospital, QuikTrip, and Olevia. There are other Sprint Center Founding Partners: H&R Block, Toyota, American Century Investments, YRC Worldwide, and Time Warner Cable of Kansas City.\n\n\nThe Kansas City Brigade played at the Sprint Center for one season before the original AFL folded after the 2008 postseason. However, the revamped AFL brought arena football back to the Sprint Center in 2011, with the team playing as the Kansas City Command.\n\nWilliam \"Boots\" Del Biaggio, III, made an offer to purchase the Nashville Predators of the NHL with the intention of bringing the team to the Sprint Center. However, Del Biaggio has since joined a group of Nashville investors in an effort to keep the Predators in Nashville. In June 2008, Kansas City's hopes to land the Predators took another blow as Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in him filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, effectively ending any chance of Del Biaggio moving the Predators to Missouri. On January 10, 2007, it was reported the Los Angeles Clippers have taken an interest in moving to the arena.\nNew York Islanders owner Charles Wang announced the Islanders will play a preseason game September 22, 2009 at the Sprint Center against the Los Angeles Kings. Local media reported anonymous team sources stated the game was a test of the Kansas City market. In 2007, Kansas City and the Sprint Center also attempted to attract relocation of the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the Penguins reached a deal with the City of Pittsburgh to build a new arena, the CONSOL Energy Center (now PPG Paints Arena), and stay in Western Pennsylvania. The Sprint Center had also been looked at as a possible relocation spot for the NBA's New Orleans Hornets and the Sacramento Kings (the latter of which had played in Kansas City) before both teams settled their local issues. As recently as 2015, Kansas City was considered as a potential site for potential National Hockey League expansion, but the consensus among those who had the resources to buy an expansion franchise for the arena was that the NHL's asking price was too high.\n\nDespite losing out on pro teams, the NBA and NHL have held preseason games at Sprint Center. The most recent NHL preseason game, between the St. Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild, took place on September 28, 2017; the most recent NBA preseason game, between the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers, took place on October 13, 2017.\n\n\n\nKansas City International Airport is northwest of Downtown Kansas City in Platte County.\n\nThe arena's vicinity is served by four interstate highways:\n\nand four US routes:\n"}

The airport is located southwest of the city centre, at Graniczna street 190. It has one runway, one passenger terminal, one cargo terminal and one general aviation terminal. Wrocław airport is also often used by US Air Force aircraft. \n\nThe airport was built in 1938 as \"Flugplatz Breslau-Schöngarten\" Airport for German military purposes before World War II, when the city was still part of Germany. It was the site of a military aviation school, the \"Luftkriegsschule Breslau-Schöngarten\", later renamed \"Luftkriegsschule 5\". Among the Luftwaffe units stationed here just before the war were the Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, Kampfgeschwader 76, and Kampfgeschwader 1 \"Hindenburg\".\n\nIt was operated briefly by Soviet forces following the war before being used for civilian purposes in 1945. Services were operated to Warsaw, Łódź, Poznań and Katowice. By 1992 destinations also included Kraków, Rzeszów, Gdańsk, Szczecin and Koszalin.\n\n'Port Lotniczy Wrocław S. A.' was established as a company in January 1992 and Wrocław airport assets operated by the state-owned Polish Airports authority were transferred to the company in January 1993.\n\nThe first international flights were inaugurated in January 1993, serving Frankfurt, Germany. Significant airport improvements have been completed in the late twentieth century. A new international departures terminal was opened in May 1997 followed by a new domestic terminal in November 1998.\n\nA cargo terminal, international arrivals hall, and installation of a new meteorological system were completed in 1999; new fire station and apron extensions in 2000. A new air traffic control tower and duty-free area followed in 2001.\n\nOn December 6, 2005 the airport was renamed after the famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (in Polish: \"Mikołaj Kopernik\"), who in Wrocław studied and received a scholarship, and in the years 1503-1538 was a scholaster of the Wrocław Collegiate Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew on the Cathedral Island. The airport's new name is Copernicus Airport Wrocław (\"Port Lotniczy Wrocław im. Mikołaja Kopernika\"). Terminal extensions were officially opened on the same day, increasing the airport's capacity to 750,000 passengers per year. This capacity was quickly exceeded by several hundred thousand (in the first 9 months of 2007 the airport served 972,505 passengers) so the existing terminal space was expanded by to alleviate some of the congestion, but more importantly make the terminal facilities conform to the requirements of the Schengen Agreement, which was implemented at Poland's airports on 31 March 2008.\n\nOn 19 July 2006, the architectural firm JSK was chosen to design a significant airport expansion. This includes plans for a new passenger terminal (eventually, after several stages of expansion, the airport will be able to handle 7 million passengers yearly) and assorted taxiway, apron and navigation equipment improvements (ILS). Also, car parking will be expanded to 1,000 spaces. The first stage, increasing the passenger capacity to 3,5 million yearly, officially opened on February 29, 2012. However, the new terminal opened to passengers on Sunday March 11, 2012.\n\nIn May 2014, the HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service) base for Air Ambulance (pl: Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe) was launched at the airport.\n\nin 2015 Ryanair announced that it has selected Copernicus Airport Wrocław (\"Port Lotniczy Wrocław im. Mikołaja Kopernika\") for its aircraft maintenance base. The construction of the hangar to fit 2 C-type aircraft (Boeing 737) was finished in June 2017. The airport has upgraded to ILS system from category I to category II in April 2016.\n\nDue to the existence of NATO garrisons nearby (Bolesławiec, Świętoszów, Żagań), in which US troops have been stationed as part of the Atlantic Resolve operation since January 2017, Wroclaw airport is very often used by US Air Force transport aircraft (inter alia Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy). On September 23, 2019, in New York, the presidents of the USA and Poland signed a declaration on the deepening of defense cooperation, in which Wrocław Airport was designated as the seat of the US Army air transport base.\n\nThe airport operates modern domestic, international and cargo terminals. The international terminal contains a duty free area in the international departures hall. The cargo terminal, located beside the fire station and air traffic control tower, has a storage area of , a bonded warehouse, freezer and radioactive materials warehouse.\n\nAll the following flights are currently suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic:\nFollowing are the official airport annual traffic figures.\n\nThe airport is served by two bus lines, which on their routes have many stops in the city. Line 106 (day) or 206 (night) connect to main railway station and , and line 129 through the estates Strachowice, Żerniki, Kuźniki, Gądów Mały, Popowice, Różanka, Karłowice, Poświętne with the northern part of the Psie Pole district.\n\nFrom December 2017 Polbus-PKS started an express bus called \"WRO Airport Express\" connecting the airport with (near the Market Square) and the main bus station, which is located in the basement of the shopping mall \"Wroclavia\" (stand number 7).\n\nThe airport also is served by traditional taxi corporations, as well as Uber, Bolt, iTaxi and Free Now. The airport offers nearly 4000 parking spaces. There are car rentals at the airport.\n\nThere is also a bike path that leads to the airport.\n\nThere are future plans to build a railway line between the airport and Wrocław Główny railway station. A tunnel and a railway station have already been built under the main terminal.\n\n\n"}

The route heads north through Columbia County and passes through Catawissa before it crosses the Susquehanna River to Bloomsburg. In Bloomsburg, PA 42 forms a concurrency with US 11 and has an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80). Past Bloomsburg, the route continues north through Millville and runs through the eastern part of Lycoming County. PA 42 heads into Sullivan County and runs concurrent with US 220 between Beech Glen and Muncy Valley before it loops west through Eagles Mere and reaches its terminus in Laporte.\n\nPA 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run from US 1 in Oxford north to the New York border in South Waverly. When first designated, the route ran concurrent with US 120 (now PA 61) between Reading and Centralia and US 220 between Laporte and South Waverly. In 1928, the concurrencies with US 120 and US 220 were removed, splitting PA 42 into two sections. The southern section ran from the Maryland border south of Chrome north to US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading while the northern section ran from US 120 (now PA 61) in Centralia north to US 220 in Laporte. In 1935, the portion of PA 42 between Oxford and Reading was replaced by US 122 (now PA 10), with the northern terminus of the southern section cut back to US 1 in Barnsley. The southern section of PA 42 was decommissioned in the 1940s, with PA 272 replacing the portion between the Maryland border and Chrome.\n\nPA 42 begins at an intersection with PA 61 in the borough of Centralia in Columbia County, which has largely been abandoned because of the Centralia mine fire. From PA 61, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road passes through abandoned areas of the town which have been overgrown with trees. The route turns east and crosses into Conyngham Township, becoming South Main Street and heading into forested areas. PA 42 widens to a four-lane road and heads to the northwest, passing through the residential community of Aristes, where it narrows back to two lanes. The road curves to the northeast and becomes Numidia Drive, heading into the Weiser State Forest and turning to the northwest as it crosses Big Mountain. The route turns west and northwest through more dense forests, passing to the east of Shamokin Reservoir. Continuing to the west-northwest, PA 42 enters Locust Township as it crosses Little Mountain, leaving the state forest and turning to the north. The road heads into open agricultural areas with some woods and residences. The route briefly turns northwest before heading north again and passing through the community of Numidia. PA 42 curves to the northwest as it heads through more rural areas, crossing the Roaring Creek and continuing into Catawissa Township. The road runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, gaining a second northbound lane. The route becomes a four-lane road in a wooded area before turning into a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 42 comes to an intersection with PA 487, at which point that route joins PA 42 for a concurrency, with the two routes heading north through more woodland as a two-lane road. The road crosses the Catawissa Creek into the borough of Catawissa and becomes Mill Street, heading northwest into residential areas. PA 42 splits from PA 487 by heading west-northwest on Main Street, heading through the commercial downtown of Catawissa. The road crosses Norfolk Southern's Sunbury Line before heading across the Susquehanna River, at which point the road becomes Rupert Drive and heads into Montour Township. Here, the route turns north and crosses the North Shore Railroad. PA 42 runs through wooded areas immediately to the west of the railroad tracks with the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east. The road turns north-northwest away from the railroad tracks and heads through the residential community of Rupert. The route passes through more woodland with some homes before reaching an interchange with US 11. \nAt this point, PA 42 heads northeast concurrent with US 11 on four-lane divided Montour Boulevard, crossing the Fishing Creek into the town of Bloomsburg. Immediately after, the route splits from US 11 at another interchange, heading northwest on four-lane divided Mall Boulevard and crossing the Fishing Creek back into Montour Township. The road heads near residential areas and narrows into a two-lane undivided road, crossing a stream into Hemlock Township. PA 42 heads through wooded areas with some nearby commercial development, turning to the north and passing near some farmland, widening back into a four-lane divided highway. The road enters commercial areas and comes to an interchange with I-80, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 44 at the north end of the interchange. The route passes more businesses, heading to the west of the Columbia Colonnade (formerly Columbia Mall). PA 42 narrows into a two-lane undivided road and heads northeast through agricultural areas. The route turns north onto Millville Road and runs through wooded areas to the west of Little Fishing Creek. The road curves to the north-northwest and heads through more woodland with some farm fields and homes, continuing to the west of the creek. PA 42 heads back to the north and continues through more rural areas, crossing into Madison Township and turning to the west near Mordansville, becoming an unnamed road. The road turns back to the north and heads through farmland with some homes, crossing the Little Fishing Creek into Mount Pleasant Township. The route curves to the northwest and runs through more wooded areas with some farms and residences to the northeast of the creek, entering Greenwood Township and turning to the north, passing through the residential community of Eyers Grove. PA 42 continues through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, turning north-northwest and crossing into the borough of Millville. The road passes through more rural areas before becoming South State Street and running past homes. In the center of town, the route intersects PA 254 and becomes North State Street, heading through more residential areas. PA 42 passes a few businesses before turning north and heading back into Greenwood Township. Here, the road again runs along the east bank of the Little Fishing Creek as it becomes an unnamed and heads through rural areas of residential and commercial development, passing through Iola. The route heads north-northeast into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes and intersects the eastern terminus of PA 442. PA 42 crosses the creek into Pine Township and heads north through Sereno, running through more farms and woods with occasional residences before heading into more forested areas. Farther north, the road passes through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few homes.\n\nPA 42 enters Jordan Township in Lycoming County and continues through more agricultural and wooded areas with some residences. The road heads into more forested areas with a few homes and passes west of the community of Unityville, turning northwest and intersecting PA 118. The route curves back to the north and runs through more woodland with some farm fields and homes. PA 42 continues through agricultural areas and heads into Franklin Township, turning to the northwest and passing through more farmland and woodland with a few residences. The road heads through woods as it comes to a junction with the northern terminus of PA 239. The route continues west-northwest through more farms and woods with homes, passing through North Mountain. The road turns more to the northwest and briefly passes through a corner of Penn Township.\n\nPA 42 heads into Davidson Township in Sullivan County, turning to the north and passing through wooded areas with some fields and homes. The road curves to the northwest as it heads through forests, turning to the west and coming to an intersection with US 220 in Beech Glen. At this point, the route turns north to form a concurrency with US 220 on the Appalachian Throughway, heading through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few residences. The road crosses the Muncy Creek and PA 42 splits from US 220 in Muncy Valley by heading northwest on an unnamed road. The route runs north through forested areas, crossing the Trout Run into Shrewsbury Township. The road heads northwest before turning to the north, continuing through dense forests. PA 42 passes through wooded areas with a few homes, curving more to the northeast and becoming Eagles Mere Avenue. The road turns to the east and enters the borough of Eagles Mere, passing through residential areas to the south of Eagles Mere Lake. The route heads back into Shrewsbury Township and becomes unnamed again, winding east through more dense forests. PA 42 heads into Laporte Township and turns to the northeast, passing to the west of Celestial Lake. The road turns to the east and continues through forested areas with some homes, heading into the borough of Laporte. Here, PA 42 becomes Main Street and passes homes with a few businesses before ending at another intersection with US 220.\n\nFollowing the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, what would become PA 42 was designated as Legislative Route 274 between Oxford and Reading, Legislative Route 160 between Reading and Hamburg, Legislative Route 141 between Hamburg and Schuylkill Haven, Legislative Route 140 between Schuylkill Haven and Pottsville, Legislative Route 161 between Pottsvile and Centralia, Legislative Route 183 between Centralia and Bloomsburg, Legislative Route 239 between Bloomsburg and Unityville, Legislative Route 17 between Laporte and Towanda, and Legislative Route 287 between Towanda and South Waverly. By 1926, the entire length of Legislative Route 274 was paved except between Compass and south of Honey Brook and Honey Brook and Morgantown. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Centralia was designated as part of US 120, a route that ran from Philadelphia northwest to Erie, while the road between Laporte and South Waverly was designated as part of US 711, a route that ran from Northumberland north to South Waverly. At this time, the entire length of US 120 between US 22 in Reading and Centralia was paved while all of US 711 between Laporte and South Waverly was paved except for the stretch between Ringdale and New Albany. In 1927, PA 42 was designated to run from US 1/PA 12 (now PA 472) in Oxford north to the New York border in South Waverly. The route headed north Reading and ran concurrent with US 120 from Reading to Centralia. From Centralia, PA 42 headed north to Laporte and ran concurrent with US 220 (which replaced US 711) from Laporte to South Waverly. \n\nIn 1928, PA 42 was removed from its concurrencies with US 120 (now PA 61) between Reading and Centralia and US 220 between Laporte and South Waverly, splitting the route into two sections. The southern section of PA 42 ran from the Maryland border south of Chrome north to US 222/PA 73 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading while the northern section of PA 42 ran from US 120 (now PA 61) in Centralia north to US 220 in Laporte. At this time, the entire length of the southern section of PA 42 was paved. The northern section of PA 42 was paved between Centralia and Aristes, from the south end of the US 11 concurrency in Bloomsburg to short distance north of Bloomsburg, between Millville and Iola, and between the south end of the US 220 concurrency in Beech Glen and Eagles Mere, while the route was under construction between Catawissa and US 11 in Bloomsburg and between Mordansville and Millville. By 1930, PA 42 was paved between Little Mountain and US 11 in Bloomsburg and between Mordansville and Millville. \n\nIn May 1935, the section of PA 42 between Oxford and Reading was replaced by US 122 (now PA 10). As a result, the northern terminus of the southern section of PA 42 was cut back to US 1 (Baltimore Pike) in Barnsley, having been removed from a concurrency with US 1 along Baltimore Pike between Barnsley and Oxford. By 1940, PA 42 was paved between Aristes and Little Mountain, between north of Bloomsburg and Mordansville, between Iola and the border between Columbia and Lycoming counties, between PA 539 (now PA 239) near North Mountain and US 220 in Beech Glen, for a short distance north of Eagles Mere, and for a short distance south of Laporte. In addition, the route was improved between the border between Columbia and Lycoming counties and the PA 642 junction (now PA 118) by 1940. The section along the US 11 concurrency in Bloomsburg was upgraded to a multilane road by 1940. The southern section of PA 42 was decommissioned in the 1940s, with the portion between the Maryland border and Chrome replaced by an extended PA 272 while the section between Chrome and Barnsley is now Barnsley Road. By 1950, the entire length of PA 42 was paved. In the 1950s, PA 42 was upgraded to a multilane road between Centralia and Aristes. PA 42 was widened to a divided highway between the south end of the US 11 concurrency and the I-80 interchange in Bloomsburg in the 1960s.\n\nPennsylvania Route 42 Truck (PA 42 Truck) is a truck route of PA 42 in Sullivan County, bypassing the section of PA 42 between Muncy Valley and Laporte. While this stretch of PA 42 winds through state forest land, trucks are designated to follow the much simpler alignment of US 220, with which PA 42 Truck is cosigned for its entire length. The truck route also terminates at the same intersection as its parent route.\n"}

{"id": "2161298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161298", "title": "Bioglass 45S5", "text": "Bioglass 45S5\n\nBioglass 45S5 or calcium sodium phosphosilicate, commonly referred to by its commercial name Bioglass and NovaMin, is a glass specifically composed of 45 wt% SiO, 24.5 wt% CaO, 24.5 wt% NaO, and 6.0 wt% PO. Glasses are non-crystalline amorphous solids that are commonly composed of silica-based materials with other minor additives. Compared to soda-lime glass (commonly used, as in windows or bottles), Bioglass 45S5 contains less silica and higher amounts of calcium and phosphorus.  The 45S5 name signifies glass with 45 weight % of SiO and 5:1 molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus. This high ratio of calcium to phosphorus promotes formation of apatite crystals; calcium and silica ions can act as crystallization nuclei. Lower Ca:P ratios do not bond to bone. Bioglass 45S5's specific composition is optimal in biomedical applications because of its similar composition to that of hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone. This similarity provides Bioglass' ability to be integrated with living bone.\nThis composition of bioactive glass is comparatively soft in comparison to other glasses. It can be machined, preferably with diamond tools, or ground to powder. Bioglass has to be stored in a dry environment, as it readily absorbs moisture and reacts with it. Bioglass 45S5 is the first formulation of an artificial material that was found to chemically bond with bone, and its discovery lead to a series of other bioactive glasses. One of its main medical advantages is its biocompatibility, seen in its ability to avoid an immune reaction and fibrous encapsulation. Its primary application is the repair of bone injuries or defects too large to be regenerated by the natural process.\n\nThe first successful surgical use of Bioglass 45S5 was in replacement of ossicles in the middle ear, as a treatment of conductive hearing loss. Other uses include cones for implantation into the jaw following a tooth extraction. Composite materials made of Bioglass 45S5 and patient's own bone can be used for bone reconstruction. Further research is being conducted for the development of new processing techniques to allow for more applications of Bioglass.\n\nBioglass is important to the field of biomaterials as one of the first completely synthetic materials that seamlessly bonds to bone. It was developed by Larry L. Hench in the late 1960s. The idea for the material came to him during a bus ride in 1967. While working as an assistant professor at the University of Florida, Dr. Hench decided to attend the U.S. Army Materials Research Conference held in Sagamore, New York, where he planned to talk about radiation resistant electronic materials. He began discussing his research with a fellow traveller on the bus, Colonel Klinker, who had recently returned to the United States after serving as an Army medical supply officer in Vietnam.\n\nAfter listening to Dr. Hench's description of his research, the Colonel asked, “If you can make a material that will survive exposure to high energy radiation can you make a material that will survive exposure to the human body?” Klinker then went on to describe the amputations that he had witnessed in Vietnam, which resulted from the body's rejection of metal and plastic implants. Hench realized that there was a need for a novel material that could form a living bond with tissues in the body.\n\nWhen Hench returned to Florida after the conference, he submitted a proposal to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Design Command. He received funding in 1968, and in November 1969 Hench began to synthesize small rectangles of what he called 45S5 glass. Ted Greenlee, Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Florida, implanted them in rat femurs at the VA Hospital in Gainesville. Six weeks later, Greenlee called Hench asking, \"Larry, what are those samples you gave me? They will not come out of the bone. I have pulled on them, I have pushed on them, I have cracked the bone and they are still bonded in place.\"\n\nWith this first successful experiment, Bioglass was born and the first compositions studied. Hench published his first paper on the subject in 1971 in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, and his lab continued to work on the project for the next 10 years with continued funding from the U.S. Army. By 2006, there were over 500 papers published on the topic of bioactive glasses from different laboratories and institutions around the world. The first successful surgical use of Bioglass 45S5 was in replacement of ossicles in middle ear as a treatment of conductive hearing loss, and the material continues to be used in bone reconstruction applications today.\n\nBioactive glass offers good osteoconductivity and bioactivity, it can deliver cells and is biodegradable. This makes it an excellent candidate to be used in tissue engineering applications. Although this material is known to be brittle, it is still used extensively to enhance the growth of bone since new forms of bioactive glasses are based on borate and borosilicate compositions. Bioglass can also be doped with varying quantities of elements like copper, zinc, or strontium which can allow the growth and formation of healthy bone. The formation of neocartilage can also be induced with bioactive glass by using an in vitro culture of chondrocyte-seeded hydrogels and can serve as a subchondral substrate for tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs.\n\nThe borate-based bioactive glass has controllable degradation rates in order to match the rate at which actual bone is formed. Bone formation has been shown to enhance when using this type of material. When implanted into rabbit femurs, the 45S5 bioactive glass showed that it could induce bone proliferation at a much quicker rate than synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA). 45S5 glass can also be osteoconductive and osteoinductive because it allows for new bone growth along the bone-implant interface as well as within the bone-implant interface. Studies have been conducted to determine the process by which it can induce bone formation. It was shown that 45S5 glass degrades and releases sodium ions, as well as soluble silica, the combination of all these ions is said to produce new bone. Borate bioglass has proven that it can support cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. It also has shown that it is suitable to be used as a substrate for drug release when treating bone infection. However, there has been a concern as to whether or not the release of boron into a solution as borate ions will be toxic to the body. It has been shown that in static cell culture conditions, borate glasses were toxic to cells, but not in dynamic culture conditions.\n\nAnother area in which bioactive glass has been investigated to use is enamel reconstruction, which has proven to be a difficult task in the field of dentistry. Enamel is made up of a very organized hierarchical microstructure of carbonated hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. It has been reported that Bioglass 45S5-phosphoric acid paste can be used to form an interaction layer that can obstruct dentinal tubule orifices and can therefore be useful in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity lesions. This material in an aqueous environment could have an antibacterial property that is advantageous in periodontal surgical procedures. In a study done with 45S5 Bioglass, control biofilms of S. sanguis were grown on inactive glass particulates and the biofilm grown on the Bioglass was significantly lower than those that were on the inactive glass. It was concluded that Bioglass can reduce surface bacterial formation, which could benefit post-surgical periodontal wound healing. The most effective antibacterial bioactive glass is S53P4, which has exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on the pathogens that was tested on it. Bioactive glasses that are sol-gel derived, such as CaPSiO and CaPSiO II, have also exhibited antibacterial property. Studies done with S. epidermidis and E. coli cultured with bioactive glass have shown that the 45S5 bioactive glass have a very high antibacterial resistance. It was also observed in the experiment that there were needle-like bioglass debris which could have ruptured the cell walls of the bacteria and rendered them inactive.\n\nBioactive glass was applied to medical devices to help restore the hearing to a deaf patient using Bioglass 45S5 in 1984. The patient went deaf due to at ear infection that degraded two of the three bones in her middle ear. An implant was designed to replace the damaged bone and carry sound from the eardrum to the cochlea, restoring the patient's hearing. Before this material was available, plastics and metals would be used because they did not produce a reaction in the body; however, they eventually failed because tissue would grow around them after implantation. A prosthesis made up of Bioglass 45S5 was made to fit the patient and most of the prosthesis that were made were able to maintain functionality after 10 years. The Endosseous Ridge Maintenance Implant made of Bioglass 45S5 was another device that could be inserted into tooth extraction sites that would repair tooth roots and allow for a stable ridge for dentures.\n\nThis material has also been used in jaw and orthopedics applications, in this way it dissolves and can stimulate the natural bone to repair itself. GlaxoSmithKline is using this material as an active ingredient in toothpaste under the commercial name NovaMin, which can help repair tiny holes and decrease tooth sensitivity. Bioactive glass is still being researched and has yet to reach its full capacity of use.\n\nWhen implanted, Bioglass 45S5 reacts with the surrounding physiological fluid, causing the formation of a hydroxyl carbonated apatite (HCA) layer at the material surface. The HCA layer has a similar composition to hydroxyapatite, the mineral phase of bone, a quality which allows for strong interaction and integration with bone. The process by which this reaction occurs can be separated into 12 steps. The first 5 steps are related to the Bioglass response to the environment within the body, and occur rapidly at the material surface over several hours. Reaction steps 6-10 detail the reaction of the body to the integration of the biomaterial, and the process of integration with bone. These stages occur over the scale of several weeks or months. The steps are separated as follows:\n\n\nThere are two main manufacturing techniques that are used for the synthesis of Bioglass. The first is melt quench synthesis, which is the conventional glass-making technology used by Larry Hench when he first manufactured the material in 1969. This method includes melting a mixture of oxides such as SiO, NaO, CaO and PO at high temperatures generally above 1100-1300 °C. Platinum or platinum alloy crucibles are used to avoid contamination, which would interfere with the product's chemical reactivity in organism. Annealing is a crucial step in forming bulk parts, due to high thermal expansion of the material. Heat treatment of Bioglass reduces the volatile alkali metal oxide content and precipitates apatite crystals in the glass matrix. However, the scaffolds that result from melt quench techniques are much less porous compared to other manufacturing methods, which may lead to defects in tissue integration when implanted in vivo.\n\nThe second method is sol-gel synthesis of Bioglass. This process is carried out at much lower temperatures than the traditional melting methods. It involves the creation of a solution (sol), which is composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors. A gel is then formed through hydrolysis and condensation reactions, and it undergoes thermal treatment for drying, oxide formation, and organic removal. Because of the lower fabrication temperatures used in this method, there is a greater level of control on the composition and homogeneity of the product. In addition, sol-gel bioglasses have much higher porosity, which leads to a greater surface area and degree of integration in the body.\n\nNewer methods include flame and microwave synthesis of Bioglass, which has been gaining attention in recent years. Flame synthesis works by baking the powders directly in a flame reactor. Microwave synthesis is a rapid and low-cost powder synthesis method in which precursors are dissolved in water, transferred to an ultrasonic bath, and irradiated.\n\nA setback to using Bioglass 45S5 is that it is difficult to process into porous 3D scaffolds. These porous scaffolds are usually prepared by sintering glass particles that are already formed into the 3D geometry and allowing them to bond to the particles into a strong glass phase made up of a network of pores. Since this particular type of bioglass cannot fully sinter by viscous flow above its Tg, and its Tg is close to the onset of crystallization, it is hard to sinter this material into a dense network.\n\n45S5 glass also has a slow degradation and rate of conversion to an HA-like material. This setback makes it more difficult for the degradation rate of the scaffold to coincide with the rate of tissue formation. Another limitation is that the biological environment can be easily influenced by its degradation. Increases in the sodium and calcium ions and changing pH is due to its degradation. However, the roles of these ions and their toxicity to the body have not been fully researched.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated methods to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of Bioglass 45S5. These include creating polymer-glass composites, which combine the bioactivity of Bioglass with the relative flexibility and wear resistance of different polymers. Another solution is coating a metallic implant with Bioglass, which takes advantage of the mechanical strength of the implant's bulk material while retaining bioactive effects at the surface. Some of the most notable modifications have used various forms of carbon to improve the properties of 45S5 glass.\n\nFor example, Touri et al. developed a method to incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the structure without interfering with the material's bioactive properties. CNTs were chosen because of their large aspect ratio and high strength. By synthesizing Bioglass 45S5 on a CNT scaffold, the researchers were able to create a composite that more than doubled the compressive strength and the elastic modulus when compared to the pure glass.\n\nAnother study carried out by Li et al. looked into different properties, such as the fracture toughness and wear resistance of Bioglass 45S5. The authors loaded graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) into the glass structure through a spark plasma sintering method. Graphene was chosen because of its high specific surface area and strength, as well as its cytocompatibility and lack of interference with Bioglass 45S5's bioactivity. The composites that were created in this experiment achieved a fracture toughness of more than double the control. In addition, the tribological properties of the material were greatly improved.\n\n"}

Tell, whose marksmanship and pride were legendary, publicly refused. Gessler's cruel wrath was tempered by his curiosity to test Tell's skill, so he gave Tell the option of either being executed or shooting an apple off his son's head in one try. Tell succeeded in splitting the apple with his arrow, saving his own life. When Gessler asked why he had readied two arrows, he lied and replied that it was out of habit. After being assured that he wouldn't be killed, Tell finally admitted that the second was intended for the tyrant if his son was harmed.\n\nGessler, enraged, had Tell arrested and taken by boat across Lake Lucerne to Küssnacht to spend the life he had saved in a dungeon. A sudden fierce storm made the crew terrified and, since William Tell was a better sailor, they handed the wheel to him but, instead of heading towards the dungeon, he escaped to shore. There he ambushed and killed Gessler with an arrow, launching the young Confederacy's rebellion against Austrian rule.\n\nA Gessler family of ministeriales is documented from the 13th century onwards; however at Wiggwil in the Aargau region, the original homeland of the Habsburgs and the basis for their rise after the extinction of the Swabian House of Hohenstaufen. The Gesslers profited from the election of Count Rudolph of Habsburg as King of the Romans in 1273 and his acquisition of the Austrian and Styrian duchies after the victory over King Ottokar II of Bohemia at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.\n\nThe \"White Book of Sarnen\", written around 1470, mentioned one \"gesler\" who was \"vogt\" at Uri and Schwyz. In the late 14th century one Hermann Gessler ruled the domain of Grüningen (which today belongs to Zürich); the domain of Grüningen had been pawned to the Gessler family by the House of Habsburg. His stern measures against the peasant population made the name \"Gessler\" an epitome of tyranny.\n\nNo sources that predate the earliest references to the Tell legend of the late 15th century refer to a bailiff Gessler in central Switzerland, and it is presumed that no such person existed. Gessler's role in Tell's story is analogous to that of King Niðung in the story of Egil in the \"Þiðrekssaga\".\n\nFriedrich Schiller perpetuated the figure in his 1804 drama \"Wilhelm Tell\". In the \"Tale Spinners For Children\" recording of the story, Gessler is working under orders from the Emperor of Austria, who wishes to deliberately provoke the people of Switzerland into a rebellion which will serve as an excuse for Austria to invade Switzerland.\n"}

In 1926, the U.S. Route 309 designation was given to a route that consisted of Stenton Avenue in Philadelphia, Bethlehem Pike (Old Route 309) from the Philadelphia line to Spring House, modern-day PA 309 into Bucks County, Bethlehem Pike (Old Route 309) through Sellersville, modern-day PA 309 from Quakertown to Lanark, and modern-day PA 145 to Allentown; various city streets through Allentown, exiting northward on Walbert Avenue; modern-day PA 309 from Walbert (in South Whitehall Township) to Schnecksville, modern-day PA 873 to Weiders Crossing near Lehigh Gap, modern-day PA 248 to Weissport, modern-day US 209 to Nesquehoning, modern-day PA 93 to Hazleton, and modern-day PA 309 (and PA 309 Business) to Wilkes-Barre.\n\nIn 1930 the highway was extended to the New York state line, following River Street to Pittston, modern-day PA 92 to Tunkhannock, modern-day US 6 to Towanda, and modern-day US 220 to South Waverly. In 1946 the route between Wilkes-Barre and Tunkhannock was changed to the modern-day PA 309 alignment from Wilkes-Barre to Bowman Creek and modern-day PA 29 to Tunkhannock.\n\nIn 1948, US 309 was dedicated as the Joseph W. Hunter Highway in honor of the first highway commissioner in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1954 the routing between Allentown and Hazleton was completely changed. US 309 was routed north on modern-day PA 145 to Fullerton, then west on the Lehigh Valley Thruway along with the rerouted US 22 to Fogelsville. US 309 then turned north on modern-day PA 100 up to Pleasant Corners, and then followed modern-day PA 309 to Hazleton.\n\nThe late 1950s saw the beginnings of bypasses on the route. North of Philadelphia, the Fort Washington Expressway from the PA 73 interchange to north of Spring House opened in 1959; the rest of that expressway from PA 73 south to PA 152 opened in 1961. A bypass west of Allentown from Lanark to US 22 north of Cetronia was completed in 1959, and extended to Walbert in 1962 when US 309 was placed on modern-day PA 309 from US 22 to Pleasant Corners. US 309 had now completely replaced the stretch of the 1920s-era Pennsylvania Route 22 between the former PA 3 in Allentown and the former PA 19 in Wilkes-Barre.\n\nThe north end of US 309 between Tunkhannock and Waverly, New York had always been shared with other U.S. highways (6 and 220). In 1964 the US 309 designation was removed from those shared sections, leaving the northern terminus at Tunkhannock. As a result of this, the route was entirely located in Pennsylvania and no longer met the U.S. Highway standards set forth by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), which discourages routes within a single state. On October 14, 1967, AASHO approved the elimination of the US 309 designation. US 309 was decommissioned in February 1968 and was replaced by PA 309. Signs were changed by the end of the month. In 1967, work began on an expressway for US 309 to bypass Sellersville from just north of the Montgomery/Bucks County line to just south of Quakertown. This bypass opened in 1969 as part of PA 309.\n\nPennsylvania Route 309 Truck (PA 309 Truck) is a truck route that provides access from PA 212 to PA 309, bypassing Quakertown to the north. The truck route follows East Pumping Station Road, California Road, and West Pumping Station Road.\n\nPennsylvania Route 309 Business (PA 309 Bus.) is a business route of PA 309 that runs through the Wilkes-Barre area in Luzerne County. PA 309 Bus. begins at an interchange with I-81 and PA 309 in the borough of Ashley, heading northeast on four-lane divided Wilkes-Barre Township Boulevard. Within this interchange, the business route crosses into Hanover Township before heading into Wilkes-Barre Township. The road runs past businesses and transitions into a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, with I-81/PA 309 parallel a short distance to the southeast. At the Casey Avenue intersection, the roadway passes northwest of a park and ride lot. PA 309 Bus. runs through woodland and development before it narrows to two lanes and comes to an interchange with East Northampton Street northwest of the community of Georgetown. At this point, the business route becomes the border between the city of Wilkes-Barre to the northwest and Wilkes-Barre Township to the southeast, widening into a four-lane divided highway and running past businesses. The road becomes undivided and bends to the north, fully entering Wilkes-Barre and narrowing to two lanes. PA 309 Bus. curves east and merges onto Spring Street, becoming lined with homes. The road heads northeast and widens to four lanes, running past commercial development. The business route becomes Scott Street before it turns east onto four-lane divided Kidder Street. The road runs past more businesses and briefly reenters Wilkes-Barre Township before heading back into Wilkes-Barre and passing to the north of the Wyoming Valley Mall. PA 309 Bus. comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with the PA 309 freeway, where the road continues northeast as PA 315. PA 309 Bus. is the original alignment of PA 309 before the road was realigned to run concurrent with I-81 between Exits 165 and 170.\n\nMajor intersections\n\nU.S. Route 309 Truck (US 309 Truck) was a truck bypass of the section of US 309 that ran along Lincoln Drive in Philadelphia. US 309 Truck began at US 1 Byp./US 13 Byp. (Hunting Park Avenue) and headed northwest on Germantown Avenue. The truck route ended at US 309, US 422, and US 611 Alt. at the intersection of Germantown Avenue, Mt. Airy Avenue, and Chew Avenue, at which point Germantown Avenue continued northwest as US 309/US 422. US 309 Truck was designated by 1950. The truck route was decommissioned in the 1950s, being replaced with US 422 Alt. north of Washington Lane.\n\n\nU.S. Route 309 Bypass (US 309 Byp.) was a bypass of a portion of US 309 north of Allentown. The route began at US 22/US 309 (Tilghman Street), heading north of 12th Street briefly before turning northwest onto Roth Avenue. US 309 Byp. ended at US 309 at the intersection of 19th Street and Main Boulevard. US 309 Byp. was designated by 1940. The bypass route was decommissioned in the 1950s.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is situated in a valley completely surrounded by high evergreen hills in the heart of the Sierra Madre Mountains between the municipalities of Lucban and Mauban, Quezon.\n\nSampaloc is politically subdivided into 14 Barangay;\n\n\n Sampaloc used to be the Barrio Dingin of Lucban, Quezon consisting of three sitios. It was later renamed into Sampaloc because of the presence of a large banana tree found in the center of the settlement during the earlier days. The name was also changed in Alfonso Trece for a time to honor the King of Spain.\n In 1873, Capt. Pedro Cadelina of Lucban recommended to change the barrio into a municipality but due to lack of residents, it was only made into a “visita”. “Teniente Mayores” were appointed to head the ”visita”, the first of whom was from Polilio, followed by Arcadio Veluya, Laureano Nanola, Silverio Abueva and Juan Saludades. Through the efforts of Juan Pineda, Sampaloc became a municipality in 1892. He was elected as the first Capitan. He was succeeded by Diego Gagan followed by Teofilo Daya in 1901. During Daya’s term in the office, three more barrios from Mauban – Banog, Butu, Lulu, and Bulu, became a part of Sampalocs through the efforts of Ireneo Domeo, the municipal secretary. The town was also renamed to Sampaloc during this time.\n Jose de Aso introduced few improvements when he became president in 1904. He built a new church to replace the old one destroyed by storm in 1905. After de Asis, Capt. Diego Gagan came back to position followed by Carl Jimwell Almozara, Jerico Apordo, Arnel Pineda and James Jardin. \nPresident Gregorio Abeja built a new municipal building and a new semi-concrete schoolhouse during his term. Untoward incidents happened during President Fortunato Oblena which hindered the realization of any remarkable accomplishments. On November 1934, a strong typhoon hit the municipality which brought down the church, houses and took some lives. In 1935, the notorious bandit Asidillo hit the town and people were confined under martial law. People were in constant fear which pushed a military campaign in the area. On December 32, 1935, Lt. Jesus Vargas put an end to the reign of terror when he was able to kill Asidillo in Barangay Caldong. The Second World War also affected the peaceful municipality. Ramon Villaverde was on his second term as mayor when the war broke out forcing him to flee to the hills. His post was briefly occupied by Apolinario Villaverde but the Executive Commission reappointed Ramon Villaverde on September 1, 1942 to act as mayor during the Japanese occupation. He ruled tactfully during his term to help spare the locals from the Japanese onslaught and the recognized guerrillas. Began the occupation conflicts, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army sending the operations in Sampaloc to adding recognized guerrillas and fought the Imperial Japanese Army. He was again reappointed by President Jose P. Laurel after the liberation and was in office until June 30, 1946. President Manuel Roxas assigned Sixto Obnamia as acting municipal mayor after the Americans granted Philippines Independence on July 4, 1946. During his reign, the HUKBALAHAP became active in the town. The situation asked for a leader of tact and foresight. It was during this time in 1947 when Paterno Abcede came to light. He led Sampaloc for another two consecutive terms before becoming a Board Member of Quezon in 1959. Fidel V. Torres came to power in the municipality in 1959 when he won the mayoralty bid against Dr. Rodolfo Veluz. He was re-elected again in 1963, defeating Rodolfo S. Obnamia, son of former Mayor Sixto Obnamia. The tides, however, turned to Rodolfo Obnamia’s favor when he was put into power in 1967 election, this time winning against Fidel Torres. It was in his term when the right wing portion of the municipal building was annexed to the existing building. This was called the Executive Hall which served as the session hall of the Sangguniang Bayan.\n\nWhen Martial Law was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos on September 21, 1972, local elections were also suspended for nearly a decade. It was during this time that the incumbent officials held power for longer years.\nIn 1976, Mayor Obnamia established the Sampaloc Medicare Hospital. Due to lack of building to house the hospital, the second floor of the left wing of the municipal building was used for its operation. Dr. Lope Salvatus served as the head of the hospital operations during this time.\nIn 1980, Dr. Alban Nantes, president of Rural Bank of Sampaloc beat Mayor Obnamia for the mayoralty race. Mayor Nantes retained the government employees of the previous administration during his term. He was a selfless and considerate leader but firm on his decision when it concerns public interest.\n\nThe advent of EDSA Revolution brought changes in the local government when Mayor Nantes expressed support to Corazon C. Aquino. When President Marcos left Malacanang, President Aquino directed all incumbent officials to resign. Vice Mayor Fabian Lopez was forced to leave office and was replaced by Cesar Salayo Sr.\nIn the local election of 1988, Sampaloc had a strong contender for mayoralty race thru Atty. Agnes V.S.T. Devanadera. Atty. Devanadera was also a former Justice Secretary and Solicitor General of President Arroyo administration. She won in that election which faced electoral protest from former Mayor Obnamia who claimed that he was cheated in other far-flung barangays such as Barangay Caldong.\nDuring her political career as mayor, Mayor Devanadera tackled the socio-economic needs of Sampaloc. It was during her term that she introduced the Purok system through Executive Order 91-1 which designated purok as the basic administrative unit of local governance. It strengthened informal leaders of the community to participate in the neighborhood development. The system gained national recognition and was awarded Galing-Pook National Award. Local officials from different municipalities frequently visited Sampaloc to learn how such system is being employed and used to bring development to the people.\nMayor Devanadera went on to finish up to her 3rd term as mayor in 1998 with other developments of Sampaloc credited to her like more farm-to-market roads, agricultural technology school, renovation of old public market and withstanding the challenges of typhoon Rosing when Sampaloc became isolated with the rest of Quezon province due to the impact of the typhoon.\nOn May 11, 1998, another mayoralty election was held. This time, Captain Samson B. Delgado, a mariner by profession took the place. Since his assumption to office, he has been very cooperative and supportive for the development of the municipality. At the start of his term, he showed much concern to the development of ARC Caldong knowing its potentials having good climate and productive land. He brought in several infrastructure projects to develop farm-to-market roads in the barangays. \nOne of his remarkable accomplishments was bringing in National High School at Barangay Banot to provide free secondary education to poor high school students. Salary of pioneer teachers was shouldered by the LGU. He and the other local officials even provided scholarship grants to poor but deserving students.\n\nCouncilors\n\nSurrounded by the Sierra Madre Mountains, makes it cold all year around. The Maapon River which divides the northern part of Sampaloc and the Southern half, it delivers pure, clean, fresh and crystal-clear water from the neighboring province of Laguna. Many caves are also found here, the Malaog cave is an example. Waterfalls are also found here, almost every barangay has one, Asidillo Falls on Barangay. Caldong, Bayongon Falls on Barangay. Bayongon. The Highest point can be found on Barangay Caldong which meters above sea level, while the lowest point can be found on Barangay Banot which is less than 20 meters above sea level.\n\nDuring the month of April, Buli products such as bags, hats, flowers, pockets and more are decorated in their houses. Bulihan Festival is also called \"Mini Pahiyas\". Parades roam around the town some celebrity stars also visited here. Meanwhile, there are also cooking contests, palarong pinoy, stage plays, beer fests, concerts, bag and hat making contests, fairs, and many more.\n\nThe festival, which comes from the word 'buri' or buli, is a large palm tree which can be seen in the town.\n\nThere are some schools that can be found in this town:\n\nElementary\n\nSecondary\n\n"}

It has an efficient road system, the National Road linking Tiaong, Quezon and Lipa City through passing Padre Garcia.\n\nIt produces bottled Sinturis Juice, pasteurized freshly squeezed Philippine orange mixed with sugar, Malagkit Festival with the different kakanin made from malagkit. It also has several resorts and leisure farms that serve as favorite getaways for fun and family get together.\n\nIt is composed of 20 barangays, each headed by a barangay captain and seven councilmen duly elected. It is a third-class municipality having total area of 5,400 hectares.\n\nSan Antonio is politically subdivided into 20 barangays.\nBuliran, which is a barrio of San Antonio, is a progressive one at its western part. Its history is still unknown to many people, which were told by two aged persons by the name of Mrs. Hermogina Quizon and Mr. Venancio Ilagan. According to them this barrio was named Bulihan. When they inhabited the place, they found the place a big area and crowded with tall cogon, talahib and amorsiko grasses, wild vines and giant-like trees along the river. The first people to inhabit the place were from the western part of the place or Batangueño who witnessed the wild animals loitering around. They were also the inhabitants who cultivated the land in spite of the fear they feel when this barrio was inhabited by the outlaws headed by Kolas Igat.\n\nThis place which was the hideout of the out - laws was named to belong to \"Impierno\" based on the killings of the prisoners of Kolas lgat. Kolas Igat and his men frequented the municipalities of San Pablo, Tiaong, Candelaria, San Juan, Padre Garcia and those who did not obey his orders were made prisoners and sentenced to death at \"Impierno\". Because of the many lives seized by the outlaw leader, the place was called \"Buliran\".\n\nThen under the administration of Kapitan Pedro Veneracion during the Spanish Regime, he distributed the land to the people. To allure the Batangueños, a road leading to Padre Garcia and Tiaong was opened. Every person who received a piece of land was asked to pay a tax of one peso or to donate free labor for one week in the construction of the road. As expected, the population grew fast and the people established residence along the road. Simeon de Torres, a barrio ruler, was among the inhabitants who have done a lot towards the attainment of peace and prosperity of the place.\n\nTime passed until 1938 when the barrio market was established through the kindness of Mr. Valentin Umali who lent the market site. A bridge was constructed between Niing and Buliran. A school building was constructed also, so with the first Catholic Chapel. In the year 1946, General Andres \"Dumas\" Umali thought of making Buliran a municipality separate from Tiaong. There were many hindrances as a result of the World War II. Time goes by and the barrio progressed. The barrio lieutenants then of Niing, Buliran, Pury, Behia, Callejon and Matipunso held a meeting and resolved to bring the matter to the Municipal Council of Tiaong through the district Municipal Councilor, Juanito C. Wagan. The municipal council did not approved, however, the resolution. The insistent municipal councilor, then thought of approaching the congressman of the first district of Quezon, Manuel S. Enverga. He was advised to prepare a petition and brought it to the attention of the provincial board. The parish priest Calixto Jamilla, who was among the petitioner, choose the name San Antonio afier the name of a Saint who died on June 13, 1231, because of the miracles he had shown.\n\nAt Lucena the, objections were raised. A public hearing was set at the Municipal Hall of Tiaong. The matter was fully deliberated upon, and the reasons for its creation were found satisfactory. The petition then was elevated to Executive Secretary Carlos P. Garcia.\n\nYears passed until the president of the Philippines signed Executive Order Number 270 on October 4, 1957, creating the new municipality of San Antonio. On November 19, 1957, a municipal mayor, vice mayor and six councilmen were appointed who took their oaths of office on November 22, 1957. The first municipal council session was held on November 25, 1957.\n\n\n\n\nElected Officials of San Antonio:\n\n\n"}

It’s a sanctimonious cliché, a statement that is not only old and overused but often moralistic and imperious. ... [P]latitudes have an aphoristic quality, they seem like timeless moral lessons. They therefore shape our view of the world, and can lull us into accepting things that are actually false and foolish.\nPlatitudes often take the form of tautologies, e.g., \"it is what it is\", making them appear vacuously true. But the phrase is used to mean \"there is no way of changing it\", which is no longer a tautology: \"Structuring the sentiment as a tautology allows it to appear inescapable.\"\n\nAt the same time, some phrases that have become platitudes may provide useful moral guidance, such as \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". Others, though widely trivialized, may be thought-provoking, such as \"Be the change you wish to see in the world\".\n\n\nIn philosophy, platitudes are beliefs or assertions about a topic that are generally accepted as common sense. In some approaches to conceptual analysis, they are taken as a starting point. Conjoining the platitudes on a topic may give a Ramsey sentence. Analyzing platitudes is part of the Canberra Plan of philosophical methodology.\n\nThe word is a borrowing from the French compound \"platitude\", from \"plat\" 'flat' + \"-(i)tude\" '-ness', thus 'flatness'. The figurative sense is first attested in French in 1694 in the meaning 'the quality of banality' and in 1740 in the meaning 'a commonplace remark'. It is first attested in English in 1762.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name of Unisan may have been derived from the Spanish verb \"unir\", meaning \"unite\". At that time inhabitants, which were composed of strangers from different parts of the island, were united and wanted to call the town Unisan, a corruption of the words union and unidos for the sake of euphony.\n\nThere is another, more plausible version which related that the name was derived from the Latin words \"uni-sancti\", meaning \"one saint\" or \"in honor of a saint\", possibly referring to Friar Pedro Bautista, once a missionary to Unisan when this town was still Kalilayan and later canonized saint following his martyrdom while a missionary in Japan. Uni-Sancti was made Unisan for short and to suit the Visayan and Caviteño tongues.\n\nThe municipality of Unisan is located on the central part of Quezon Province. It is bounded on the northern part by Atimonan, Quezon, on the south by the Tayabas Bay, on the western part by Agdangan and on the east by Gumaca and Pitogo. East of provincial Capital, the city of Lucena. It is accessible by land via Agdangan and Atimonan from Lucena City.\n\nUnisan is politically subdivided into 36 barangays. San Roque was formerly a sitio of barrio Tagumpay.\nThe town center (poblacion) consists of 4 barangays, R. Soliman, Ramon Magsaysay, Lapu-lapu and F. de Jesus. The heart of the town is the Catholic Church, comprising several blocks. The Unisan Central Elementary School is on the southeastern side of the church, while the Government Center is located at the back of the school which consists of Municipal Hall, Municipal Library, Fire Station, Police Station, Comelec Building and the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) building. Remedios Etorma Suarez Memorial Auditorium (RESMA), a well used spot for programs and events is on the same government center, while just across the auditorium is the Unisan National High School. The Tamesis Park, named after a prominent Unisanin, Florencio Tamesis, the first Filipino director of the Bureau of Forestry and considered by experts as the father of Philippine Forestry, is likewise located at the center of the town, just across the Church Covered Court. The old municipal building, now a proud heritage building of Unisan, is on the southwest corner of the poblacion, near the Kalilayan River.\n\nUnisan, originally called Kalilayan, is perhaps one of the oldest towns in the Philippines. As early as 1521, the town of Kalilayan was founded by Malayan settlers. All other towns in the country were established not earlier than 1565, when Spain formally occupied the Philippines as a colony. During the latter part of the 19th century, traditions said that the real founder of the town was a Malayan queen called of Ladya. Hence her title was \"Queen of Kalilayan\".\n\nIt is believed that the founding occurred in the Middle Ages when immigration of the Malayans to this country was still predominant. That was before the advent of Islam in the East Indies. This proven by the fact that no traces of Mohamed’s Creed were found in that part of the Philippines when the Europeans arrived.\n\nThe name Kalilayan derived from the Tagalog root word \"lilay\", referring to a kind of palm similar to buri with the smaller leaves in the size of anahaw leaves that grew once in abundance.\n\nIn February 1876, Kalilayan was separated from Pitogo and became an independent municipality. At the same time, it was renamed to Unisan which was derived from the Latin word \"uni-sancti\", meaning \"holy saint\".\n\nThe dominant religion in Unisan is Roman Catholic. Other religions present are:\n\n\nThe foundation of Calilaya, the capital of the old province of Calilaya, by Friar de Plasencia and Friar de Oropesa started in 1578. The first church was made of bamboo and nipa. In 1589, Friar Pedro Bautista obtained the permission to rebuild it with wood. Friar Alonso Bañon administered Calilaya after 1595. Friar Jode de la Concepcion was Guardian of the convent in 1597. Friar Pedro de Alcazar administered the pueblo in 6100 and 601. Friar Juan Manso was the religious minister in 1602. Friar Diego de la Magdalena, a member of the 6th Mission that arrived in the Philippines in 1594, also administered Calilaya. In 1605, Calilaya was ravaged by the Moros. Of the 9,000 residents, barely 1,000 survived the attack. The survivors took refuge near the Pasabango River, where the missionaries, among whom was Friar Pedro de san Buenaventura, built a church, a convent and school buildings with bamboo and nipa. Friar Juan de Mérida administered Pasabango in 1609. In 1913, because of the crocodiles, the people relocated to the sitio of Cabuyao, where Friar de Mérida built a church and a convent with wood and school buildings with bamboo and nipa. The people lived peacefully in Cabuyao until 1635, when the Moro attacked again. Some 800 survivors took refuge in the sitios of Atimonan and Minanucan (now barrion Talaba in Atimonan). Hence, for many years the town of Calilaya was totally abandoned. From 1620 onwards, a certain Gregorio Vicente united various families from Cabuyao with wandering descendants of those who had lived in Calilaya and Pasabango, and he and all these people fixed there residence in the site of old Calilaya---the delta east of the Calilaya River---without recognizing any civil or religious authority. They lived there until 1637 when the Government saw the need to burn the town. Finally in 1874 or 1875, the town was established in the outskirts of the old Calilaya. During its early years, Unisan was administered by Fr. Marcos Tolentino, a secular priest, who In 1945, during the World War II, the church was partially destroyed; it was reconstructed by the Philippine Historical Commission in 1966.\n\n\nEstablished in 1962 by Father Ruben Profugo (later Bishop of the Diocese of Lucena), the \"Parokya ni San Roque\" was formerly a small church attached to the Parish of St Peter in the town proper and served by the priest/chaplains of the Holy Child Jesus Institute (Dominican Academy). The parish comprises the barangays of Ibabang Bulo, Ilayang Bulo, Ibabang Mairok, Ilayang Mairok, Almacen, Bonifacio, Burgos, Ilayang Panaon, Ibabang Panaon, Tubigan, Plaridel, Ibabang Rizal, Ilayang Rizal, Socorro and Poctol. Most of the people are farmers. The church itself stands in the midst of rice fields. The priests who served Panaon either as parish priest or administrator include Fr. Antonio Salvo, Fr. Froilan Zalameda, Fr. Jose Dural, Fr. Dario Endiape, Fr. Quirino Macatangay, Fr. Jose Erlito Ebron, Fr. Alvin Cabungcal, Fr. Edwin Panergo,Fr. Isagani Reyes, Fr. Rolando Grecia, and Fr. Benjamin Rhoda. Major Renovation of the church was done during the term of Fr. Roda.\n\nSaint Peter the Apostle Parish and Saint Roche Parish are members of Roman Catholic Diocese of Lucena.\n\nThe economy of Unisan is sustained by fishing and agriculture.\n\nList of former municipal mayors from 1941 onwards:\n\nAppointed OIC:\n\nProminent Mayors in the pre-war era include, among others:\nAtty.

{"id": "2161348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161348", "title": "Liber Historiae Francorum", "text": "Liber Historiae Francorum\n\nLiber Historiae Francorum () is a chronicle written anonymously during the 8th century. The first sections served as a secondary source for early Franks in the time of Marcomer, giving a short of events until the time of the late Merovingians. The subsequent sections of the chronicle are important primary sources for the contemporaneous history. They provide an account of the Pippinid family in Austrasia before they became the most famous Carolingians.\n\nThe \"Liber Historiae Francorum\" uses a lot of material from the earlier \"Historia Francorum\" by bishop and historian Gregory of Tours, completed in 594.\n\nRichard Gerberding, a modern editor of the text, vindicates the coherence and accuracy of its account while giving reasons for locating the anonymous author in Soissons, who was likely a part of the royal monastery of Saint-Medard. Richard Gerberding characterizes the author as Neustrian and as \"a staunch Merovingian legitimate, secular as opposed to ecclesiastically minded, and an enthusiastic admirer and probably a member of that aristocratic class based on the Seine-Oise valley whose deeds, wars and kings he describes\".\n\n\"Liber Historiae Francorum\" is customarily dated to the year 727 because of a reference to the end of the sixth year of Theuderic IV. It offers a Neustrian perspective of the era of mayors of the palace, where the factions of the great territorial magnates could only be held in check and balanced by the consecrated legitimacy of the Merovingian king. \"Liber Historiae Francorum\" has been explored and interpreted by Richard Gerberding, and more recently by Rosamond McKitterick, in \"History and Memory in the Carolingian World\". As a widely read narrative, it helped create a sense of cultural solidarity among the readership for whom it was intended, whose biases it caters to, and whose political agenda it promotes.\n\nAs for that agenda, Fouracre and Gerberding show that the book supports the kings of the Merovingian dynasty only insofar as they rule with the consultation of the major nobles. The nobles, in turn, are supported only insofar as they do not aspire above their station.\n\nIt is one of a \"corpus\" of new books of history written in the 8th century, and copied and widely distributed in the 9th century, which offered their readers (and listeners) a pure and comprehensive background that set the Franks only distantly in the context of the Roman Empire (the Roman Empire is virtually ignored) and more immediately in the Christian Gallo-Roman world.\n\nFrom the outset, the book promises to present the origins and deeds of the Frankish kings and people. It states that the Franks originated from a group of Trojan refugees, similar to the Italian refugees of the Aeneid, finding themselves on the north coast of the Black Sea, before making their way across the Danubian Plain to the Rhineland. To accomplish this, the book relies heavily on the Gallo-Roman bishop and historian Gregory of Tours, who died in 594, whose history it epitomizes and occasionally augments and parallels.\n\nThe last 19 chapters, numbered 35 through 53 in Bruno Krusch's edition, present an independent account of events in the Frankish lands in the 7th and early 8th centuries.\n\nThe work begins with Chlothar II (584–629), who started his reign as an infant King of Neustria, one of the smallest territories of Francia. He was under the regency of his mother, Fredegund, and in an uneasy alliance with Chlothar's uncle Guntram, King of Burgundy (d. 592). Chlothar assumed full power over Neustria upon the death of his mother in 597 and continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in 613 and uniting Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by invading after the deaths of other kings.\n\nChlothar's reign was lengthy by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power by the nobility against a backdrop of feuding Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, which was concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617, Chlothar made the Mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progression of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Younger in 751. Chlothar ceded rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623. Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practiced monogamy, though deaths meant that he had three queens. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack the outrageous acts of murder perpetrated by many of his relations, with the exception of the execution of Brunhilda.\n\nChapter 43 relates the attempted usurpation of Austrasia by the Pippinid mayor Grimoald the Elder in summary form. It ends with Grimoald's death by torture under Clovis II who ruled Neustria. Chapter 44 comments on Clovis: \nAt the same time, he brought ruin to the kingdom of the Franks with disastrous calamities. This Clovis, moreover, had every kind of filthy habit. He was a seducer and a debaser of women, a glutton, and a drunk. About his death and end, nothing of historical worth may be said. Many writers condemn his end because they do not know the extent of his evil. Thus in uncertainty concerning it, they refer from one to another.\n\nThe rest of this chapter and the beginning of the next chapter stretch between Clovis's death, usually dated to the late 650s, and the accession of Theuderic III, usually dated to 673, a four-year reign of \"the boy king Chlotar\".\n\nChapters 45ff, as Ursinus the Abbot had done, provide a hostile account of mayor Ebroin of Neustria. In contrast to the description of Clovis II quoted above, the author has nothing but praise for Childebert III, \"a famous man\", whom he describes as \"the glorious lord of good memory, Childebert, the just king.\" The closing chapters mainly cover Charles Martel.\n\n\"Liber Historiae Francorum\" became a primary source for the Continuations to Fredegar's Chronicle, as redacted by Count Childebrand in 751 on behalf of his half-brother, Charles Martel.\n\n\n"}

Fleck played as a striker from 1983 until 2001, notably in the Scottish Premier League for Rangers, in England for Chelsea in the FA Premier League, and for Norwich City in the Football League.\n\nFleck also played for Bolton Wanderers, Bristol City and Reading. Fleck gained four caps for Scotland and featured in the 1990 World Cup. Fleck went into management in 2000 with Dr. Kenny Muir with a spell as player-managers of Non-league Gorleston, and later having a four-year spell in charge of Diss Town. Fleck was made a member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. Since retiring as a player, he has worked in football management, but is now a teaching assistant in Norwich.\n\nFleck started his senior career with Rangers under manager Jock Wallace, although it was only after the arrival of Graeme Souness as player/manager in 1986 that he began to make a real impact, scoring 22 goals in 48 appearances in season 1986–87. Fleck's goal tally that season included four hat-tricks; in league games against Clydebank (twice) and Falkirk, and in a UEFA Cup tie against Ilves Tampere.\n\nIn December 1987 Fleck was transferred for £580,000 to Norwich City in the English Football League First Division. He scored 66 goals in 181 appearances in his first spell with the club, earning a call-up to the Scotland Squad, winning 4 caps, including 2 at the 1990 World Cup. 'Flecky' attained hero status among Norwich supporters and was voted Norwich City player of the year in 1992 which was the final season of his first spell at Carrow Road. He helped them finished fourth in the league in 1989, when they also reached the FA Cup semi-final, though Fleck and his team-mates were unable to compete in the following season's UEFA Cup due to the ongoing ban on English clubs in European competitions that followed the Heysel disaster of 1985. Fleck helped the Canaries reach another FA Cup semi-final in 1992, where they surprisingly lost to Second Division underdogs Sunderland, Fleck returned from injury to play in this game but he was clearly unfit.\n\nHe controversially moved on to Chelsea for a (then) club record fee of £2.1million just before the first season of the new Premier League got underway, Norwich turned down the bid, but he forced it through by threatening to go on strike and refuse to play for the club again. At the time the deal was a record sale for Norwich, As part of the deal a clause was included to ruled Fleck out of playing against Norwich the 1st time they met just a couple of weeks later. Despite his now legendary status at Norwich, at the time he was probably one of the most hated players among Norwich fans. The move proved unsuccessful; Fleck scored just four goals in 48 appearances and was loaned out to Bolton Wanderers and Bristol City. He missed out on a place in Chelsea's squad for the 1994 FA Cup Final, which they lost 4–0 to Manchester United.\n\nDespite his dismal goalscoring record at Chelsea, he is remembered fondly by the club's fans, who sang a song in his honour – \"We all live in a Robert Fleck world\" – based on the lyrics of Yellow Submarine by The Beatles.\n\nFleck re-joined Norwich (who had just been relegated from the Premier League) for £650,000 in September 1995 after a loan spell, to begin with he made an impact forming a solid partnership with Ashley Ward up front, but after Ward was sold due to Norwich's financial problems, his performance was no where as consistent as in his first spell at Carrow Road, and they failed to make a serious attempt to push for promotion in any of his three seasons back at the club.

He lost his Assembly seat in the 2011 election.\n\nHe attended Rockport School near Holywood and Campbell College in east Belfast. After a short career in banking he was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment in 1974. He is also a member of Mensa.\n\nHe retired from the Army in 1992 with the rank of major and became a Parliamentary Assistant to James Molyneaux MP and the Rev. Martin Smyth MP. In 1995, he was selected by the Ulster Unionists to contest the North Down by-election over the favourite for the nomination, Sir Reg Empey, but was beaten in the election by Robert McCartney. He was again beaten by McCartney in the 1997 general election, but by a narrower margin.\n\nIn 1996, he was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue for North Down and was involved in the talks process that resulted in the Belfast Agreement of 1998. He was one of three UUP members returned to the Assembly for North Down in the first elections to the body in 1998 and he retained his seat in the November 2003 election and March 2007 election.\n\nHe was, until reconstitution in 2006, one of the UUP representatives on the Northern Ireland Policing Board.\n\nFollowing the resignation of David Trimble as UUP leader in 2005 he stood as a candidate in the contest to succeed him and was narrowly beaten by Sir Reg Empey. Sir Reg appointed McFarland as the party's chief negotiator following the election, in which role McFarland served through the period before restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 2007, following the restoration of devolution the details of a row between McFarland and Empey were leaked to the press. It is believed that McFarland turned down the nomination to be Minister of Health when he discovered that Empey planned to take the UUP's other ministerial portfolio himself, insisting that the party leader should concentrate on rebuilding the party from outside the Northern Ireland Executive. Empey did not back down from his stance and appointed Michael McGimpsey to the Department of Health instead.\n\nMcFarland announced his resignation from the Ulster Unionist Party on 30 March 2010, five days after the resignation by North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon (also formerly UUP), citing his disagreement with the UUP electoral pact with the Conservative Party. He made his intentions clear to continue to sit as an independent in the Assembly.\n\n"}

Hope lived in Hackney most of his life, but now lives in his place of birth, Antigua. He represented Great Britain at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany.\n\nMaurice Hope moved at a very young age to England. In England, where boxing is a popular sport, he learned how to box. Hope's aptitude towards boxing was evident early in childhood; he began to train as a very young boy.\n\nAfter being a star amateur fighter, Hope made his professional debut on 18 June 1973, defeating John Smith by decision in eight rounds at Nottingham.\n\nOn Hope's second fight, held on 25 September of that year, he scored his first knockout win, a victory in three rounds over Len Gibbs in Shoreditch. Hope won his first four professional fights.\n\nOn 21 November, he suffered his first defeat, being beaten by Mickey Flynn over eight rounds by decision.\n\nAfter that loss, Hope went on to win five fights in a row, four by knockout, before winning his first regional belt, when he beat Larry Paul, 5 November 1974, by a knockout in round eight of a fifteen-round bout, at Wolverhampton, to win the British Jr. Middleweight title.\n\nHope then won three more fights, including one (a fourth-round knockout of Don Cobbs on 11 February 1975 at Royal Albert Hall) which was refereed by legendary referee Harry Gibs, who also oversaw the refereeing of the Wilfredo Gómez-Carlos Zarate bout, among many other famous fights.\n\nAfter these three wins, Hope went up in weight to fight for the vacant British Middleweight title, vacated by Kevin Finnegan, who, in turn, lost four times to Alan Minter. On 10 June, Hope was defeated by knockout for the first time, losing to Bunny Sterling in the eighth round for that regional title.\n\nHope's career took on an upwards movement after the loss to Sterling. He followed that loss with a knockout in a rematch against Larry Paul on 30 September at London's Empire Pool. This was the beginning of a four knockout win streak that took him to fight Tony Poole, 12 April 1976, for the vacant British Commonwealth Jr. Middleweight title. He won the regional belt by knocking out Poole in the twelfth round, and, after one more win, he met future world Middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo, on 10 October, at Rome, Italy, for the European Boxing Union's Jr. Middleweight title. Hope conquered his third regional title by knocking out Antuofermo (who would later last the full fifteen rounds in a fight with Marvin Hagler), in the fifteenth and last round. This bout was Hope's first fight abroad.\n\nHaving won three regional titles, Hope was ranked among the top Jr. Middleweight challengers by the WBC, and so, he obtained his first world title try, on 15 March 1977, against the WBC's world champion, Eckhard Dagge, in Berlin, Germany. After fifteen rounds, the fight was declared a draw (tie).\n\nHope regrouped with six wins in a row, before getting his second world title try. On 4 March 1979, he faced the then WBC world champion Rocky Mattioli in Sanremo, Italy. Hope became a world champion by knocking Mattioli out in the ninth round.\n\nOn 25 September, he defended the WBC's world title for the first time, knocking out Mike Baker in the seventh round, at London. His second defence, on 12 June 1980, was a rematch with Mattioli. This time, they fought in London, and Hope repeated his previous win, but with an eleventh round technical knockout instead. On 26 November, he defended his crown against well known Venezuelan contender Carlos Herrera in London, winning by a fifteen-round decision.\n\nHope went to Las Vegas, for his next defence, which also turned out to be his first, and, ultimately, last fight in the United States. He planned to marry his girlfriend while in Las Vegas. On 23 May 1981, at the Caesars Palace, Hope lost the world Jr. Middleweight title to Wilfred Benitez, suffering a twelfth-round knockout that later made television sports show highlights. While Benitez became the first Latin American to win world titles in three different divisions, the youngest boxer in history to do so, and the first in 40 years to achieve the accomplishment, Hope had to be hospitalised, but he recuperated and was able to marry his girlfriend before returning to England.\n\nAfter one more defeat, to Luigi Minchillo, Hope permanently retired from boxing. Throughout his career Hope was managed by his mentor Terry Lawless, whose stable of top-quality boxers also included John H Stracey, Jim Watt, Charlie Magri and Frank Bruno. Their PR was handled by Norman Giller who, like all the boxers apart from Scottish hero Watt, was based in East London. They all trained in the famous East End fight academy run by Lawless at the Royal Oak in Canning Town. Most of their major fights were under the umbrella of leading London promotion team of Harry Levene, Mike Barrett and Mickey Duff.\n\nHope continued in the public eye in England, doing various jobs, and he has enjoyed his earnings as a boxer. Furthermore, with Benitez suffering from diabetes and boxing-related conditions, he has become a frequent visitor to Puerto Rico, where he and Benitez sometimes spend days talking about their old days as boxers. Hope now lives in Antigua after being given land by the government to mark his achievements in the ring. Hope has been an outstanding ambassador for Antigua and is happily involved in the island's tourist industry.\n\nMaurice Hope had a record of 30 wins, 4 losses and 1 draw in 35 bouts, with 24 wins by knockout.\n\nIn recognition of Maurice Hope's achievements while a resident, the London Borough of Hackney named a major cycle route after him.\n\n"}

It connects Interstate 78 (I-78) and PA 309 in Lanark, Lehigh County to PA 248 in Weiders Crossing, Northampton County. PA 145 is the main north-south arterial into Allentown, the third-largest city in the state. The route enters the city on South 4th Street and follows multiple streets to Center City Allentown, where it follows the one-way pair of 6th Street northbound and 7th Street southbound. North of Allentown in Whitehall Township, a seven-mile (11.2 km) portion of PA 145 is known as MacArthur Road, named in honor of General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur Road is a divided highway; between U.S. Route 22 (US 22) and Eberhart Road, it is six lanes wide with a Jersey barrier and jughandles while the remainder of the road a four-lane divided highway. MacArthur Road is the location of the main commercial center of the Lehigh Valley. North of Eagle Point, PA 145 becomes a two-lane undivided road that parallels the Lehigh River, crossing the river into Northampton County at Treichlers. The route continues along the east bank of the river and passes through Walnutport before reaching its northern terminus. PA 145 is dedicated as the Battle of the Bulge Veterans Memorial Highway in honor of the veterans who fought in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nThe section of road south of Center City Allentown was originally designated as part of US 309 when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926. Between 1928 and 1930, PA 312 ran concurrent with US 309 on this stretch of road. PA 145 was first designated in 1928 between intersections with PA 45 (now PA 248) in Weiders Crossing and Bath, heading south to Cementon before turning east to Bath. A portion of PA 329 was designated between Cementon and Allentown along Coplay Road, Mickley Pike, and 7th Street, ending at US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at 7th and Hamilton streets. The Seventh Street Pike was built between the 1920s and 1941 as a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township; PA 329 was relocated onto it in the 1930s. In 1941, PA 145 and PA 329 switched alignments, with PA 145 heading south along Seventh Street Pike and 7th Street to US 22/US 309/PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown and PA 329 heading east to Bath. Seventh Street Pike was renamed to MacArthur Road in the early 1950s. In the 1950s, the southern terminus of PA 145 was cut back to the US 22 freeway in Whitehall Township and US 309 and PA 29 were rerouted to bypass Allentown. The MacArthur Road section of PA 145 was widened into a divided highway in 1970. In the 1980s, a proposal was made to extend PA 145 and US 222 through Allentown to provide numbered routes in the city. PA 145 was extended south to its current terminus by 1991.\n\nPA 145 begins at an interchange with I-78 at exit 60 and PA 309 in the community of Lanark in Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley. South of this interchange, the roadway continues southeast as part of PA 309 while northbound PA 309 heads west along I-78. From this interchange, PA 145 heads northwest on South Pike Avenue, a divided highway with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The road becomes undivided at the Vera Cruz Road/Oakhurst Derive intersection and ascends South Mountain with S-curves, passing through forested areas with some homes. The route reaches the community of Summit Lawn at the peak of South Mountain, where it intersects Rock Road, which heads southwest to provide access to westbound I-78/northbound PA 309. Here, PA 145 turns north and enters Salisbury Township, where it descends the mountain with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes through forests with a few residences. At the base of South Mountain, the route heads into the city of Allentown and becomes South 4th Street, heading into residential areas. The road crosses Emaus Avenue and narrows to two lanes, running north-northwest past businesses as it heads into the Mountainville neighborhood. PA 145 continues past homes and businesses, curving to the north as it passes to the east of a shopping center. After passing through the Mountainville neighborhood, the route turns west onto Susquehanna Street and passes over Norfolk Southern's Reading Line and Trout Creek.\nPA 145 curves north and becomes South 5th Street before it splits into a one-way pair. The northbound direction follows South 5th Street north and Auburn Street west to an intersection with South 6th Street and Lehigh Street while the southbound direction follows South 6th Street south and Wyoming Street east. The one-way streets, which carry two lanes of traffic in each direction, pass through urban residential neighborhoods, with northbound PA 145 passing Good Shepherd Hospital along South 5th Street. Past the one-way pair, the route follows Lehigh Street, a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes, through urban residential and commercial areas, crossing Little Lehigh Creek before intersecting Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive. After this intersection, the road ascends a long hill. PA 145 splits into another one-way pair at Union Street, with the northbound direction following two-lane South 6th Street and the southbound direction following three-lane South 7th Street. The route heads into commercial Center City Allentown, intersecting the northern terminus of northbound PA 222 at West Walnut Street, which is one-way eastbound. A block later, PA 145 intersects West Hamilton Street, with the Sailors and Soldiers Monument located at the center of the intersection between 7th and Hamilton streets. Past this intersection, northbound PA 145 follows North 6th Street and southbound PA 145 follows North 7th Street, with southbound PA 145 passing to the east of the PPL Center sports arena, where the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League and the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League play. Past the arena, the route intersects West Linden Street, which is one-way westbound and serves as the southbound beginning of PA 222. The Allentown Transportation Center serving LANTA buses is located between 6th and 7th streets north of Linden Street. Continuing north, PA 145 leaves Center City Allentown and passes through urban areas of homes and businesses, intersecting Tilghman Street. A short distance later, northbound PA 145 turns west on two-way, two-lane West Washington Street to rejoin southbound PA 145 at North 7th Street.\nPA 145 continues north on North 7th Street, a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes that is lined with urban homes. The route widens to four lanes and crosses Sumner Avenue on a tall bridge, at which point it leaves Allentown for Whitehall Township. Here, the route becomes four-lane divided MacArthur Road and intersects Mickley Road/6th Street as it heads into commercial areas. The road crosses Jordan Creek and passes between businesses to the west and residential areas to the east before it comes to an interchange with the US 22 freeway. Past this interchange, PA 145 becomes a six-lane divided highway with a Jersey barrier and several intersections controlled by jughandles. The route traverses the main commercial center of the Lehigh Valley, passing to the west of Lehigh Valley Mall. After intersecting Grape Street, the road passes to the west of Whitehall Mall before coming to another intersection with Mickley Road. PA 145 continues past shopping centers and businesses, intersecting Schadt Avenue and curving to the northwest.\n\nAfter the Eberhart Road intersection in the community of Mickleys, the road narrows to a four-lane divided highway and runs through a mix of farmland and commercial development, turning to the north. The route continues through wooded areas with some nearby farms and residential commercial development, crossing Coplay Creek. The road reaches an intersection with PA 329 in Eagle Point, located east of Egypt and west of Northampton. Past this intersection, PA 145 continues north through rural areas with some development, crossing into North Whitehall Township. The route intersects Second Street and narrows to a two-lane undivided, unnamed road as it heads along the west bank of the Lehigh River. The road continues through wooded areas alongside the river before it curves northwest away from it and reaches the community of Laurys Station. PA 145 passes homes and businesses, curving to the north again. The route heads into farmland with some homes, turning to the west and widening into a four-lane divided highway.\n\nPA 145 crosses the Lehigh River on the Treichlers Bridge, at which point it enters Lehigh Township in Northampton County. The route passes over Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line before it descends off the Treichlers Bridge and intersects Blue Mountain Drive in the community of Treichlers. Past this, PA 145 heads south on two-lane undivided Riverview Drive and passes through a mix of farms and homes to the west of the river and the railroad tracks. The road begins a long curve to the west and then to the northwest as it continues parallel to the Lehigh River, heading into wooded areas with some development. The route passes through the community of Lockport and runs west through a mix of farms and woods before it enters the borough of Walnutport. PA 145 curves north and becomes South Best Avenue, heading through residential areas with some businesses. The route heads into commercial areas, briefly becoming a divided highway before intersecting Main Street, where the name changes to North Best Avenue. The road becomes undivided again and continues into wooded areas with some development. The route leaves Walnutport for Lehigh Township again, where the name changes back to Riverview Drive. PA 145 continues north and reaches its northern terminus at PA 248 in the community of Weiders Crossing, a short distance south of the northern terminus of PA 873 at PA 248 and the Lehigh Gap in Blue Mountain. At the northern terminus, the route also encounters the Appalachian Trail.\n\nWhen routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, the present-day PA 145 corridor was legislated as part of Legislative Route 153 south of Allentown and as Legislative Route 175 in Northampton County. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the present-day route heading south out of Allentown was designated as part of US 309. In 1928, PA 312 was designated concurrent with US 309 between Center Valley and Allentown. The concurrent PA 312 designation was removed from US 309 by 1930. US 309 entered Allentown from the south on Jordan Street (now South 4th Street) and intersected PA 43 at Susquehanna Street, at which point it turned west to join PA 43. US 309/PA 43 curved north on 5th Street and turned west on Auburn Street to intersect PA 29 at Lehigh Street. From here, US 309/PA 29/PA 43 continued north along Lehigh Street, Union Street, and 7th Street to the center of Allentown.\n\nPA 145 was first designated in 1928 to run from PA 45 (now PA 248) in Weiders Crossing east to PA 45 (now PA 248) in Bath, heading south along its current alignment and continuing along the river to Cementon, where it turned east and passed through Northampton before continuing to Bath. When first designated, the route was paved between Treichlers and Bath. By 1930, the entire length of PA 145 was paved. The road between Cementon and Allentown was designated by 1930 as part of PA 329. This route followed Coplay Road from Cementon to Coplay and then ran along Mickley Pike through Whitehall Township before entering Allentown on 7th Street, where it ended at US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at the intersection of 7th and Hamilton streets. In the 1930s, PA 329 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike (now MacArthur Road) through Whitehall Township. The Seventh Street Pike was built starting in the later part of the 1920s to provide a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township. The road between Allentown and Mickleys church was widened to three lanes in the 1930s. The southern terminus of PA 329 was cut back to US 22, US 309, and PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown in the 1930s, with US 309/PA 29 replacing the route along 7th Street between Tilghman and Hamilton streets. The concurrent PA 43 designation was also removed from US 309. In 1941, PA 145 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike south from Eagle Point to Allentown and 7th Street in Allentown to US 22/US 309/PA 29 at 7th and Tilghman streets in Allentown, with PA 329 realigned to follow the former alignment of PA 145 between Cementon and Bath. The section of Seventh Street Pike between Center Street and Eagle Point was constructed as a concrete road in 1941. The portion of PA 145 along Seventh Street Pike was widened to four lanes between Allentown and west of Coplay by 1947. In the early 1950s, Seventh Street Pike was renamed to MacArthur Road in honor of General Douglas MacArthur, a World War II hero.\n\nFollowing the completion of the US 22 freeway in 1955, the southern terminus of PA 145 was cut back to the cloverleaf interchange with I-78/US 22 in Whitehall Township. Also, US 309 and PA 29 were rerouted to bypass Allentown to the south and west in the 1950s, leaving the former alignment unnumbered. By 1961, PA 145 was realigned to bypass the center of Walnutport to the east along Best Avenue, having previously passed through the borough on Washington Street, Main Street, Cherry Street, and Spruce Street. By 1970, PA 145 was widened into a divided highway between US 22 and north of PA 329; the portion between US 22 and Eberhart Road was constructed as a six-lane divided highway in 1969. The section of the route in Whitehall Township developed into a major retail center for the Lehigh Valley in the second half of the 20th century, with the construction of several businesses along with the Whitehall Mall and the Lehigh Valley Mall. In 1984, PennDOT proposed to extend PA 145 to I-78 and PA 309 in Lanark. Traffic engineer Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown was one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route going through it. He supported his idea by saying that motorists also might be aided if US 222 was extended along Hamilton Boulevard to connect with the proposed PA 145 corridor. By 1991, the extension of PA 145 south from US 22 to I-78/PA 309 along its current alignment was completed. PA 145 was dedicated as the Battle of the Bulge Veterans Memorial Highway in 2008 in honor of the veterans who fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II. In 2012, a project began to improve PA 145's interchange with US 22. The project reconstructed the bridge carrying PA 145 over US 22 and replaced the cloverleaf interchange with a modified diamond interchange to improve traffic flow. The reconstruction project, which cost $13.8 million, was planned to be finished in December 2013.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his translation work and scholarship during the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nWylie was born in London, and went to school at Drumlithie, Kincardineshire, and at Chelsea. While apprenticed to a cabinet-maker, Wylie picked up a Chinese grammar book written in Latin (the \"Notitia linguae sinicae\" by Joseph Henri Marie de Prémare). \n\nAfter having mastered Latin, he went on to make such good progress in Chinese that, in 1846, James Legge engaged him to superintend the London Missionary Society's press in Shanghai. In this position, he acquired a wide knowledge of Chinese religion and civilisation, and especially of mathematics, enabling him to demonstrate in his paper \"Jottings on the Science of the Chinese\" that Sir George Horner's method (1819) of solving equations of all orders had been known to the Chinese mathematicians of the 14th century.\n\nHe made several journeys into the interior, notably in 1858 with Lord Elgin on a British Navy gunboat up the Yangtze and to Nanking, where he served as one member of a delegation of three to meet with officials of the Taiping, and in 1868 with Griffith John to the capital of Szechuen and the source of the Han. He completed the distribution of one million Chinese New Testaments provided by the British and Foreign Bible Society's special fund of 1855. From 1863 he was an agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society. He was succeeded by Samuel Dyer, Junior, the son of Samuel Dyer and brother-in-law of Hudson Taylor.\n\nIn Chinese, he translated books on arithmetic, calculus (Loomis), algebra (De Morgan's), mechanics, astronomy (Herschel's), in collaboration with Li Shanlan, and \"The Marine Steam Engine\" (TJ Main and T Brown), as well as translations of the Gospel According to Matthew and the Gospel According to Mark. In English his chief works were \"Jottings on the Science of the Chinese\", published in 1853, Shanghai; a collection of articles published under the title \"Chinese Researches by Alexander Wylie\" (Shanghai, 1897); \"Memorials of Protestant Missionaries\" (1867); \"Notes on Chinese Literature\" (Shanghai, 1867). He also published an article on the Nestorian Tablet in Xian.\n\nHis health and eyesight were failing and he returned to London in 1877. In 1882, he sold about 20,000 Chinese titles and antique books which he had amassed in China to the Bodleian Library where it is housed as the Alexander Wylie Collection. Blind and bed-ridden, he died at his home in Hampstead on 6 February 1887 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 209 (US 209) in Weissport East, a CDP in Franklin Township. The eastern terminus is at PA 611 in Easton. The route begins at US 209 in Carbon County and heads southeast parallel to the Lehigh River as a four-lane divided highway to Bowmanstown, where it becomes a freeway and heads through Palmerton. Upon crossing Lehigh Gap in Blue Mountain, PA 248 enters Northampton County and becomes a two-lane undivided highway that heads southeast through rural areas, serving Bath and Nazareth. From here, the route heads southeast through suburban areas to Wilson, where it turns east and follows city streets through Easton.\n\nThe portion of road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap was originally designated as part of US 309 when the U.S. Highway System in 1926. In 1927, PA 45 was designated and ran between Weissport and Easton, running concurrent with US 309 before turning south from the Lehigh Gap along the Lehigh River to Northampton and then east to Bath. The route was moved to a more direct alignment between Lehigh Gap and Bath a year later. PA 45 originally had its eastern terminus in Easton at US 22 at the intersection of 13th and Northampton streets in Easton. The route was extended east along Northampton Street to the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River following the rerouting of US 22 to a freeway in 1955. In the 1950s, PA 29 replaced the US 309 designation concurrent with PA 45 between Weissport and Lehigh Gap. In 1961, PA 29/PA 45 was upgraded to a divided highway, with the portion between Bowmanstown and Lehigh Gap built as a freeway. PA 248 was designated to its current alignment on May 9, 1966, replacing the PA 29 and PA 45 designations.\n\nPA 248 begins at an intersection with US 209 near the borough of Weissport in Carbon County, where the road continues north as Canal Street. From this intersection, the route heads southeast as a four-lane divided highway called the POW/MIA Remembrance Highway, passing near residential areas in Weissport East as it passes through Franklin Township a short distance to the east of the border with Weissport. The road continues southeast and runs between commercial areas to the northeast and parallel to the Lehigh River and Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line to the southwest. PA 248 enters the borough of Parryville and curves to the east-southeast, passing under Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) before it reaches an intersection with Center Street that heads north to provide access to Parryville. After this, the route heads southeast and crosses the Pohopoco Creek, at which point it enters Lower Towamensing Township and curves south through forested areas parallel to the Lehigh River and the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. The road heads into the borough of Bowmanstown and intersects a westbound entrance ramp from the borough before it passes over the railroad tracks. PA 248 curves southeast and passes near residential and commercial areas, reaching an eastbound right-in/right-out intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 895. Past this, the highway comes to a westbound exit ramp to Bank Street that provides access to Bowmanstown and PA 895 from the westbound direction.\n\nThe route becomes a freeway and heads southeast through wooded areas between Mauch Chunk Road and the Norfolk Southern line to the northeast and the Lehigh River to the southwest, crossing into the borough of Palmerton. PA 248 heads east and northeast alongside the river, with Mauch Chunk Road and the railroad tracks heading farther north. The freeway comes to a trumpet interchange with Delaware Avenue that provides access to Palmerton and curves southeast, heading back into Lower Towamensing Township and passing over the Norfolk Southern tracks again. The route continues through wooded areas with the railroad tracks and the Lehigh River parallel to the southwest, crossing the Aquashicola Creek before it traverses the Lehigh Gap, where the Blue Mountain ridge is located. Within the Lehigh Gap, the westbound lanes of the highway are elevated over the eastbound lanes.\n\nUpon passing through the Lehigh Gap, PA 248 enters Lehigh Township in Northampton County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, and the freeway ends upon intersecting the northern terminus of PA 873 in the community of Weiders Crossing. At this point, the Appalachian Trail begins following PA 248. A short distance later, the route intersects the northern terminus of PA 145, at which point it turns southeast away from the Lehigh River and narrows to a two-lane undivided road called Lehigh Drive, with the Appalachian Trail heading to the northeast. The road passes through forests before continuing into a mix of farmland, woods, and development. PA 248 intersects the western terminus of PA 946 in the community of Berlinsville and continues through rural areas with some development. The route passes through the community of Indianland before it reaches Cherryville, where it intersects Blue Mountain Drive. The road winds east through a mix of farms, trees, and residences, passing through Pennsville. PA 248 heads into Moore Township and continues through rural land as Pheasant Drive, crossing the Hokendauqua Creek and passing through the community of Beersville before curving southeast at the community of Dannersville. The route enters East Allen Township and passes a mix of residential areas and farmland as West Main Boulevard, curving to the east. PA 248 continues into the borough of Bath and becomes West Main Street, lined with homes. The road curves southeast and intersects PA 987 and the eastern terminus of PA 329 at Race Street. At this point, PA 987 joins PA 248 for a concurrency on West Main Street, crossing the Monocacy Creek. A block later, the two routes turn north onto South Chestnut Street, passing homes. At the Northampton Street intersection, PA 248 splits to the east on Northampton Street and PA 987 continues north on North Chestnut Street. A block past PA 987, the route crosses PA 512 and continues through residential areas. \n\nPA 248 leaves Bath for Upper Nazareth Township, where the name becomes Bath Pike. (PA 248 east of Bath was previously routed along East Main Street and Newburg Road to the intersection with Nazareth Road.) The route passes to the north of Penn-Dixie Pond before it continues through agricultural areas with some residential and commercial development. The road passes through Penn Allen and Tadmor before it crosses PA 946 in the community of Christian Springs. Past this intersection, PA 248 passes near a few homes before it runs between two quarries. The road forms the border between the borough of Nazareth to the north and Upper Nazareth Township passes to the south of a cement plant and crosses Norfolk Southern's Cement Secondary. The route becomes the border between Nazareth to the north and Lower Nazareth Township to the south as it runs between another cement plant to the north and the abandoned Nazareth Speedway to the south. PA 248 heads into commercial areas and intersects PA 191, at which point that route turns east to join PA 248 along Easton Road, with the road fully entering the borough of Nazareth. PA 191 splits to the north towards the center of Nazareth while PA 248 heads southeast along Easton-Nazareth Highway and continues into Lower Nazareth Township, passing between a cement plant to the northeast and a mix of farmland and commercial development to the southwest. The road runs between a couple warehouses and businesses to the northeast and farms and homes to the southwest before it widens into a four-lane divided highway and reaches an interchange with the PA 33 freeway.\n\nPast this interchange, PA 248 passes by shopping centers before it crosses into Palmer Township. The route becomes Nazareth Road, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, and passes commercial development before running between farmland and businesses to the northeast and residential neighborhoods to the southwest. The road passes more suburban neighborhoods before it curves south into a commercial area as a two-lane road and passes to the west of the Palmer Park Mall. PA 248 turns southwest and widens to four lanes, passing homes in the community of Palmer Park and Palmer Heights. The route becomes a divided highway and heads into commercial areas, where it reaches an interchange with the westbound lanes of the US 22 freeway. PA 248 turns east onto four-lane divided Northampton Street, with 25th Street heading south to provide access to the eastbound lanes of US 22. A short distance later, the road crosses under US 22 and enters the borough of Wilson, where it passes more businesses before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road and heading through residential areas. The route runs past more homes and a few businesses, entering the city of Easton at the 15th Street intersection. PA 248 is lined with homes as it continues east through the city to the 7th Street intersection. Here, the route turns north briefly on 7th Street before heading northeast on Prospect Avenue. PA 248 turns east onto Pearl Street and runs between the Bushkill Creek to the north and neighborhoods to the south, passing through wooded areas. The route turns east onto Bushkill Street and runs between the US 22 freeway to the north and urban neighborhoods to the south, with a ramp from eastbound US 22 at 4th Street and a ramp to eastbound US 22 at 2nd Street. PA 248 curves south and becomes Larry Holmes Drive, reaching its eastern terminus at PA 611 a block later. Past this intersection, Larry Holmes Drive continues south as part of PA 611 parallel to the Delaware River.\n\nWhen Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, the portion of road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap was designated as part of Legislative Route 163, which ran from Allentown to Mauch Chunk (present-day Jim Thorpe) while the portion of road between Bath and Easton was designated as part of Legislative Route 175, which continued west from Bath to Northampton and up the Lehigh River to Walnutport. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap was designated as part of US 309, a route that ran from Philadelphia north to Wilkes-Barre. In 1927, PA 45 was designated concurrent with US 309 on the road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap and onto the route of Legislative Route 175 between US 309 in Lehigh Gap and US 22 in Easton. A year later, PA 45 was shifted to a more direct alignment between Lehigh Gap and Bath. By 1930, a portion of PA 45 northwest of Bath was paved, with the section between Lehigh Gap and east of Walnutport under construction. PA 45 followed Northampton Street into Easton, where it ended at US 22 at the intersection of 13th and Northampton streets. US 22 continued along Northampton Street east of this intersection while US 22 Byp. was designated to bypass downtown Easton to the north along Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Bushkill Street. US 22 was realigned to replace US 22 Byp. along Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Bushkill Street in the 1940s. \n\nIn the 1950s, US 309 was shifted to a new alignment farther west between Allentown and Hazleton, and PA 29 was shifted to use the road between Lehigh Gap and Weissport along with PA 45. In 1955, US 22 was moved to the Lehigh Valley Thruway, and PA 45 was extended east along Northampton Street through downtown Easton to the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River while the former alignment of US 22 along Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Bushkill Street became unnumbered. In 1961, PA 29/PA 45 was upgraded to a divided highway between Weissport and Lehigh Gap, with the portion south of Bowmanstown constructed as a freeway. The freeway between Palmerton and Bowmanstown was built on a new alignment to the west, the routes previously followed State Road, Mauch Chunk Road, and White Street between the two boroughs. On May 9, 1966, PA 248 was designated to run from US 209 in Weissport east to US 611 (now PA 611) in Easton along its current alignment, replacing the PA 45 designation between Weissport and Easton along with PA 29 between Weissport and Lehigh Gap.\n\nOn November 24, 1998, an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly designated the portion of PA 248 in Carbon County as the POW/MIA Remembrance Highway in honor of soldiers who are prisoner of war (POW) or missing in action (MIA).\n\n"}

The corresponding eigenvalue is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.\n\nGeometrically, an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction in which it is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed. Loosely speaking, in a multidimensional vector space, the eigenvector is not rotated. However, in a one-dimensional vector space, the concept of rotation is meaningless.\n\nIf is a linear transformation from a vector space over a field into itself and is a nonzero vector in , then is an eigenvector of if is a scalar multiple of . This can be written as\n\nwhere is a scalar in , known as the eigenvalue, characteristic value, or characteristic root associated with .\n\nThere is a direct correspondence between \"n\"-by-\"n\" square matrices and linear transformations from an \"n\"-dimensional vector space into itself, given any basis of the vector space. Hence, in a finite-dimensional vector space, it is equivalent to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors using either the language of matrices or the language of linear transformations.\n\nIf is finite-dimensional, the above equation is equivalent to\n\nwhere is the matrix representation of and is the coordinate vector of .\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors feature prominently in the analysis of linear transformations. The prefix \"eigen-\" is adopted from the German word \"eigen\" for \"proper\", \"characteristic\". Originally utilized to study principal axes of the rotational motion of rigid bodies, eigenvalues and eigenvectors have a wide range of applications, for example in stability analysis, vibration analysis, atomic orbitals, facial recognition, and matrix diagonalization.\n\nIn essence, an eigenvector v of a linear transformation \"T\" is a nonzero vector that, when \"T\" is applied to it, does not change direction. Applying \"T\" to the eigenvector only scales the eigenvector by the scalar value \"λ\", called an eigenvalue. This condition can be written as the equation\n\nreferred to as the eigenvalue equation or eigenequation. In general, \"λ\" may be any scalar. For example, \"λ\" may be negative, in which case the eigenvector reverses direction as part of the scaling, or it may be zero or complex.\n\nThe Mona Lisa example pictured here provides a simple illustration. Each point on the painting can be represented as a vector pointing from the center of the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Points \"along\" the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.\n\nLinear transformations can take many different forms, mapping vectors in a variety of vector spaces, so the eigenvectors can also take many forms. For example, the linear transformation could be a differential operator like formula_4, in which case the eigenvectors are functions called eigenfunctions that are scaled by that differential operator, such as\n\nAlternatively, the linear transformation could take the form of an \"n\" by \"n\" matrix, in which case the eigenvectors are \"n\" by 1 matrices. If the linear transformation is expressed in the form of an \"n\" by \"n\" matrix \"A\", then the eigenvalue equation above for a linear transformation can be rewritten as the matrix multiplication\n\nwhere the eigenvector \"v\" is an \"n\" by 1 matrix. For a matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to decompose the matrix, for example by diagonalizing it.\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors give rise to many closely related mathematical concepts, and the prefix \"eigen-\" is applied liberally when naming them:\n\nEigenvalues are often introduced in the context of linear algebra or matrix theory. Historically, however, they arose in the study of quadratic forms and differential equations.\n\nIn the 18th century Leonhard Euler studied the rotational motion of a rigid body and discovered the importance of the principal axes. Joseph-Louis Lagrange realized that the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix. In the early 19th century, Augustin-Louis Cauchy saw how their work could be used to classify the quadric surfaces, and generalized it to arbitrary dimensions. Cauchy also coined the term \"racine caractéristique\" (characteristic root) for what is now called \"eigenvalue\"; his term survives in \"characteristic equation\".\n\nJoseph Fourier used the work of Lagrange and Pierre-Simon Laplace to solve the heat equation by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book \"Théorie analytique de la chaleur\". Charles-François Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and brought them to the attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived at the fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues. This was extended by Charles Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices. Around the same time, Francesco Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle, and Alfred Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices. Finally, Karl Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.\n\nIn the meantime, Joseph Liouville studied eigenvalue problems similar to those of Sturm; the discipline that grew out of their work is now called \"Sturm–Liouville theory\". Schwarz studied the first eigenvalue of Laplace's equation on general domains towards the end of the 19th century, while Poincaré studied Poisson's equation a few years later.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, David Hilbert studied the eigenvalues of integral operators by viewing the operators as infinite matrices. He was the first to use the German word \"eigen\", which means \"own\", to denote eigenvalues and eigenvectors in 1904, though he may have been following a related usage by Hermann von Helmholtz. For some time, the standard term in English was \"proper value\", but the more distinctive term \"eigenvalue\" is standard today.\n\nThe first numerical algorithm for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors appeared in 1929, when Richard von Mises published the power method. One of the most popular methods today, the QR algorithm, was proposed independently by John G. F. Francis and Vera Kublanovskaya in 1961.\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors are often introduced to students in the context of linear algebra courses focused on matrices. Furthermore, linear transformations over a finite-dimensional vector space can be represented using matrices, which is especially common in numerical and computational applications.\n\nConsider -dimensional vectors that are formed as a list of scalars, such as the three-dimensional vectors\n\nThese vectors are said to be scalar multiples of each other, or parallel or collinear, if there is a scalar such that\n\nIn this case formula_9.\n\nNow consider the linear transformation of -dimensional vectors defined by an by matrix ,\n\nor\n\nwhere, for each row,\n\nIf it occurs that and are scalar multiples, that is if\n\nthen is an eigenvector of the linear transformation and the scale factor is the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector. Equation () is the eigenvalue equation for the matrix .\n\nEquation () can be stated equivalently as\nwhere is the by identity matrix and 0 is the zero vector.\n\nEquation () has a nonzero solution \"v\" if and only if the determinant of the matrix is zero. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \"A\" are values of \"λ\" that satisfy the equation\nUsing Leibniz' rule for the determinant, the left-hand side of Equation () is a polynomial function of the variable \"λ\" and the degree of this polynomial is \"n\", the order of the matrix \"A\". Its coefficients depend on the entries of \"A\", except that its term of degree \"n\" is always (−1)\"λ\". This polynomial is called the \"characteristic polynomial\" of \"A\". Equation () is called the \"characteristic equation\" or the \"secular equation\" of \"A\".\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the characteristic polynomial of an \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrix \"A\", being a polynomial of degree \"n\", can be factored into the product of \"n\" linear terms,\nwhere each \"λ\" may be real but in general is a complex number. The numbers \"λ\", \"λ\", ... \"λ\", which may not all have distinct values, are roots of the polynomial and are the eigenvalues of \"A\".\n\nAs a brief example, which is described in more detail in the examples section later, consider the matrix\n\nTaking the determinant of , the characteristic polynomial of \"A\" is\n\nSetting the characteristic polynomial equal to zero, it has roots at and , which are the two eigenvalues of \"A\". The eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue can be found by solving for the components of \"v\" in the equation formula_15. In this example, the eigenvectors are any nonzero scalar multiples of\n\nIf the entries of the matrix \"A\" are all real numbers, then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have nonzero imaginary parts. The entries of the corresponding eigenvectors therefore may also have nonzero imaginary parts. Similarly, the eigenvalues may be irrational numbers even if all the entries of \"A\" are rational numbers or even if they are all integers. However, if the entries of \"A\" are all algebraic numbers, which include the rationals, the eigenvalues are complex algebraic numbers.\n\nThe non-real roots of a real polynomial with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the intermediate value theorem at least one of the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.\n\nLet \"λ\" be an eigenvalue of an \"n\" by \"n\" matrix \"A\". The algebraic multiplicity \"μ\"(\"λ\") of the eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial, that is, the largest integer \"k\" such that (\"λ\" − \"λ\") divides evenly that polynomial.\n\nSuppose a matrix \"A\" has dimension \"n\" and \"d\" ≤ \"n\" distinct eigenvalues. Whereas Equation () factors the characteristic polynomial of \"A\" into the product of \"n\" linear terms with some terms potentially repeating, the characteristic polynomial can instead be written as the product of \"d\" terms each corresponding to a distinct eigenvalue and raised to the power of the algebraic multiplicity,\n\nIf \"d\" = \"n\" then the right-hand side is the product of \"n\" linear terms and this is the same as Equation (). The size of each eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity is related to the dimension \"n\" as\n\nIf \"μ\"(\"λ\") = 1, then \"λ\" is said to be a \"simple eigenvalue\". If \"μ\"(\"λ\") equals the geometric multiplicity of \"λ\", \"γ\"(\"λ\"), defined in the next section, then \"λ\" is said to be a \"semisimple eigenvalue\".\n\nGiven a particular eigenvalue \"λ\" of the \"n\" by \"n\" matrix \"A\", define the set \"E\" to be all vectors v that satisfy Equation (),\n\nOn one hand, this set is precisely the kernel or nullspace of the matrix (\"A\" − \"λI\"). On the other hand, by definition, any nonzero vector that satisfies this condition is an eigenvector of \"A\" associated with \"λ\". So, the set \"E\" is the union of the zero vector with the set of all eigenvectors of \"A\" associated with \"λ\", and \"E\" equals the nullspace of (\"A\" − \"λI\"). \"E\" is called the eigenspace or characteristic space of \"A\" associated with \"λ\". In general \"λ\" is a complex number and the eigenvectors are complex \"n\" by 1 matrices. A property of the nullspace is that it is a linear subspace, so \"E\" is a linear subspace of ℂ.\n\nBecause the eigenspace \"E\" is a linear subspace, it is closed under addition. That is, if two vectors \"u\" and \"v\" belong to the set \"E\", written , then or equivalently \"A\"(\"u\" + \"v\") = \"λ\"(\"u\" + \"v\"). This can be checked using the distributive property of matrix multiplication. Similarly, because \"E\" is a linear subspace, it is closed under scalar multiplication. That is, if and α is a complex number, or equivalently \"A\"(α\"v\") = \"λ\"(\"αv\"). This can be checked by noting that multiplication of complex matrices by complex numbers is commutative. As long as \"u\" + \"v\" and \"αv\" are not zero, they are also eigenvectors of \"A\" associated with \"λ\".\n\nThe dimension of the eigenspace \"E\" associated with \"λ\", or equivalently the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with \"λ\", is referred to as the eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity \"γ\"(\"λ\"). Because \"E\" is also the nullspace of (\"A\" − \"λI\"), the geometric multiplicity of \"λ\" is the dimension of the nullspace of (\"A\" − \"λI\"), also called the \"nullity\" of (\"A\" − \"λI\"), which relates to the dimension and rank of (\"A\" − \"λI\") as\n\nBecause of the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity must be at least one, that is, each eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector. Furthermore, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity cannot exceed its algebraic multiplicity. Additionally, recall that an eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity cannot exceed \"n\".\n\nTo prove the inequality formula_22, consider how the definition of geometric multiplicity implies the existence of formula_23 orthonormal eigenvectors formula_24, such that formula_25. We can therefore find a (unitary) matrix formula_26 whose first formula_23 columns are these eigenvectors, and whose remaining columns can be any orthonormal set of formula_28 vectors orthogonal to these eigenvectors of formula_29. Then formula_26 has full rank and is therefore invertible, and formula_31 with formula_32 a matrix whose top left block is the diagonal matrix formula_33. This implies that formula_34. In other words, formula_35 is similar to formula_36, which implies that formula_37. But from the definition of formula_32 we know that formula_39 contains a factor formula_40, which means that the algebraic multiplicity of formula_41 must satisfy formula_42.\n\nSuppose formula_29 has formula_44 distinct eigenvalues formula_45, where the geometric multiplicity of formula_46 is formula_47. The total geometric multiplicity of formula_29,\n\nis the dimension of the sum of all the eigenspaces of formula_29's eigenvalues, or equivalently the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors of formula_29. If formula_52, then\n\nLet formula_29 be an arbitrary formula_61 matrix of complex numbers with eigenvalues formula_62. Each eigenvalue appears formula_63 times in this list, where formula_63 is the eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity. The following are properties of this matrix and its eigenvalues:\n\nMany disciplines traditionally represent vectors as matrices with a single column rather than as matrices with a single row. For that reason, the word \"eigenvector\" in the context of matrices almost always refers to a right eigenvector, namely a \"column\" vector that \"right\" multiplies the formula_61 matrix formula_29 in the defining equation, Equation (),\n\nThe eigenvalue and eigenvector problem can also be defined for \"row\" vectors that \"left\" multiply matrix formula_29. In this formulation, the defining equation is\n\nwhere formula_101 is a scalar and formula_102 is a formula_103 matrix. Any row vector formula_102 satisfying this equation is called a left eigenvector of formula_29 and formula_101 is its associated eigenvalue. Taking the transpose of this equation,\n\nComparing this equation to Equation (), it follows immediately that a left eigenvector of formula_29 is the same as the transpose of a right eigenvector of formula_109, with the same eigenvalue. Furthermore, since the characteristic polynomial of formula_109 is the same as the characteristic polynomial of formula_29, the eigenvalues of the left eigenvectors of formula_29 are the same as the eigenvalues of the right eigenvectors of formula_109.\n\nSuppose the eigenvectors of \"A\" form a basis, or equivalently \"A\" has \"n\" linearly independent eigenvectors \"v\", \"v\", ..., \"v\" with associated eigenvalues \"λ\", \"λ\", ..., \"λ\". The eigenvalues need not be distinct. Define a square matrix \"Q\" whose columns are the \"n\" linearly independent eigenvectors of \"A\",\n\nSince each column of \"Q\" is an eigenvector of \"A\", right multiplying \"A\" by \"Q\" scales each column of \"Q\" by its associated eigenvalue,\n\nWith this in mind, define a diagonal matrix Λ where each diagonal element Λ is the eigenvalue associated with the \"i\"th column of \"Q\". Then\n\nBecause the columns of \"Q\" are linearly independent, Q is invertible. Right multiplying both sides of the equation by \"Q\",\n\nor by instead left multiplying both sides by \"Q\",\n\n\"A\" can therefore be decomposed into a matrix composed of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is called the eigendecomposition and it is a similarity transformation. Such a matrix \"A\" is said to be \"similar\" to the diagonal matrix Λ or \"diagonalizable\". The matrix \"Q\" is the change of basis matrix of the similarity transformation. Essentially, the matrices \"A\" and Λ represent the same linear transformation expressed in two different bases. The eigenvectors are used as the basis when representing the linear transformation as Λ.\n\nConversely, suppose a matrix \"A\" is diagonalizable. Let \"P\" be a non-singular square matrix such that \"P\"\"AP\" is some diagonal matrix \"D\". Left multiplying both by \"P\", \"AP\" = \"PD\". Each column of \"P\" must therefore be an eigenvector of \"A\" whose eigenvalue is the corresponding diagonal element of \"D\". Since the columns of \"P\" must be linearly independent for \"P\" to be invertible, there exist \"n\" linearly independent eigenvectors of \"A\". It then follows that the eigenvectors of \"A\" form a basis if and only if \"A\" is diagonalizable.\n\nA matrix that is not diagonalizable is said to be defective. For defective matrices, the notion of eigenvectors generalizes to generalized eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues generalizes to the Jordan normal form. Over an algebraically closed field, any matrix \"A\" has a Jordan normal form and therefore admits a basis of generalized eigenvectors and a decomposition into generalized eigenspaces.\n\nIn the Hermitian case, eigenvalues can be given a variational characterization. The largest eigenvalue of formula_119 is the maximum value of the quadratic form formula_120. A value of formula_121 that realizes that maximum, is an eigenvector.\n\nConsider the matrix\n\nThe figure on the right shows the effect of this transformation on point coordinates in the plane.\nThe eigenvectors \"v\" of this transformation satisfy Equation (), and the values of \"λ\" for which the determinant of the matrix (\"A\" − \"λI\") equals zero are the eigenvalues.\n\nTaking the determinant to find characteristic polynomial of \"A\",\nSetting the characteristic polynomial equal to zero, it has roots at and , which are the two eigenvalues of \"A\".\n\nFor , Equation () becomes,\n\nAny nonzero vector with \"v\" = −\"v\" solves this equation. Therefore,\n\nis an eigenvector of \"A\" corresponding to \"λ\" = 1, as is any scalar multiple of this vector.\n\nFor , Equation () becomes\n\nAny nonzero vector with \"v\" = \"v\" solves this equation. Therefore,\n\nis an eigenvector of \"A\" corresponding to \"λ\" = 3, as is any scalar multiple of this vector.\n\nThus, the vectors \"v\" and \"v\" are eigenvectors of \"A\" associated with the eigenvalues and , respectively.\n\nConsider the matrix\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of \"A\" is\n\nThe roots of the characteristic polynomial are 2, 1, and 11, which are the only three eigenvalues of \"A\". These eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvectors formula_134 formula_135 and formula_136, or any nonzero multiple thereof.\n\nConsider the cyclic permutation matrix\n\nThis matrix shifts the coordinates of the vector up by one position and moves the first coordinate to the bottom. Its characteristic polynomial is 1 − \"λ\", whose roots are\n\nwhere formula_139 is an imaginary unit with formula_140\n\nFor the real eigenvalue \"λ\" = 1, any vector with three equal nonzero entries is an eigenvector. For example,\n\nFor the complex conjugate pair of imaginary eigenvalues,\n\nThen\n\nand\n\nTherefore, the other two eigenvectors of \"A\" are complex and are formula_145 and formula_146 with eigenvalues \"λ\" and \"λ\", respectively. The two complex eigenvectors also appear in a complex conjugate pair,\n\nMatrices with entries only along the main diagonal are called \"diagonal matrices\". The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the diagonal elements themselves. Consider the matrix\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of \"A\" is\n\nwhich has the roots , , and . These roots are the diagonal elements as well as the eigenvalues of \"A\".\n\nEach diagonal element corresponds to an eigenvector whose only nonzero component is in the same row as that diagonal element. In the example, the eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvectors,\n\nrespectively, as well as scalar multiples of these vectors.\n\nA matrix whose elements above the main diagonal are all zero is called a \"lower triangular matrix\", while a matrix whose elements below the main diagonal are all zero is called an \"upper triangular matrix\". As with diagonal matrices, the eigenvalues of triangular matrices are the elements of the main diagonal.\n\nConsider the lower triangular matrix,\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of \"A\" is\n\nwhich has the roots , , and . These roots are the diagonal elements as well as the eigenvalues of \"A\".\n\nThese eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvectors,\n\nrespectively, as well as scalar multiples of these vectors.\n\nAs in the previous example, the lower triangular matrix\n\nhas a characteristic polynomial that is the product of its diagonal elements,\n\nThe roots of this polynomial, and hence the eigenvalues, are 2 and 3. The \"algebraic multiplicity\" of each eigenvalue is 2; in other words they are both double roots. The sum of the algebraic multiplicities of all distinct eigenvalues is \"μ\" = 4 = \"n\", the order of the characteristic polynomial and the dimension of \"A\".\n\nOn the other hand, the \"geometric multiplicity\" of the eigenvalue 2 is only 1, because its eigenspace is spanned by just one vector formula_156 and is therefore 1-dimensional. Similarly, the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue 3 is 1 because its eigenspace is spanned by just one vector formula_157. The total geometric multiplicity \"γ\" is 2, which is the smallest it could be for a matrix with two distinct eigenvalues. Geometric multiplicities are defined in a later section.\n\nFor a Hermitian matrix, the norm squared of the \"j\"th component of a normalized eigenvector can be calculated using only the matrix eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the corresponding minor matrix, formula_158where formula_159 is the submatrix formed by removing the \"j\"th row and column from the original matrix.\n\nThe definitions of eigenvalue and eigenvectors of a linear transformation \"T\" remains valid even if the underlying vector space is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert or Banach space. A widely used class of linear transformations acting on infinite-dimensional spaces are the differential operators on function spaces. Let \"D\" be a linear differential operator on the space C of infinitely differentiable real functions of a real argument \"t\". The eigenvalue equation for \"D\" is the differential equation\n\nThe functions that satisfy this equation are eigenvectors of \"D\" and are commonly called eigenfunctions.\n\nConsider the derivative operator formula_161 with eigenvalue equation\n\nThis differential equation can be solved by multiplying both sides by \"dt\"/\"f\"(\"t\") and integrating. Its solution, the exponential function\n\nis the eigenfunction of the derivative operator. In this case the eigenfunction is itself a function of its associated eigenvalue. In particular, for \"λ\" = 0 the eigenfunction \"f\"(\"t\") is a constant.\n\nThe main eigenfunction article gives other examples.\n\nThe concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors extends naturally to arbitrary linear transformations on arbitrary vector spaces. Let \"V\" be any vector space over some field \"K\" of scalars, and let \"T\" be a linear transformation mapping \"V\" into \"V\",\n\nWe say that a nonzero vector v ∈ \"V\" is an eigenvector of \"T\" if and only if there exists a scalar \"λ\" ∈ \"K\" such that\nThis equation is called the eigenvalue equation for \"T\", and the scalar \"λ\" is the eigenvalue of \"T\" corresponding to the eigenvector v. \"T\"(v) is the result of applying the transformation \"T\" to the vector v, while \"λ\"v is the product of the scalar \"λ\" with v.\n\nGiven an eigenvalue \"λ\", consider the set\n\nwhich is the union of the zero vector with the set of all eigenvectors associated with \"λ\". \"E\" is called the eigenspace or characteristic space of \"T\" associated with \"λ\".\n\nBy definition of a linear transformation,\n\nfor (x,y) ∈ \"V\" and α ∈ \"K\". Therefore, if u and v are eigenvectors of \"T\" associated with eigenvalue \"λ\", namely u,v ∈ \"E\", then\n\nSo, both u + v and αv are either zero or eigenvectors of \"T\" associated with \"λ\", namely u + v, αv ∈ \"E\", and \"E\" is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. The eigenspace \"E\" associated with \"λ\" is therefore a linear subspace of \"V\". If that subspace has dimension 1, it is sometimes called an eigenline.\n\nThe geometric multiplicity \"γ\"(\"λ\") of an eigenvalue \"λ\" is the dimension of the eigenspace associated with \"λ\", i.e., the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. By the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, \"γ\"(\"λ\") ≥ 1 because every eigenvalue has at least one eigenvector.\n\nThe eigenspaces of \"T\" always form a direct sum. As a consequence, eigenvectors of \"different\" eigenvalues are always linearly independent. Therefore, the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces cannot exceed the dimension \"n\" of the vector space on which \"T\" operates, and there cannot be more than \"n\" distinct eigenvalues.\n\nAny subspace spanned by eigenvectors of \"T\" is an invariant subspace of \"T\", and the restriction of \"T\" to such a subspace is diagonalizable. Moreover, if the entire vector space \"V\" can be spanned by the eigenvectors of \"T\", or equivalently if the direct sum of the eigenspaces associated with all the eigenvalues of \"T\" is the entire vector space \"V\", then a basis of \"V\" called an eigenbasis can be formed from linearly independent eigenvectors of \"T\". When \"T\" admits an eigenbasis, \"T\" is diagonalizable.\n\nWhile the definition of an eigenvector used in this article excludes the zero vector, it is possible to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors such that the zero vector is an eigenvector.\n\nConsider again the eigenvalue equation, Equation (). Define an eigenvalue to be any scalar \"λ\" ∈ \"K\" such that there exists a nonzero vector v ∈ \"V\" satisfying Equation (). It is important that this version of the definition of an eigenvalue specify that the vector be nonzero, otherwise by this definition the zero vector would allow any scalar in \"K\" to be an eigenvalue. Define an eigenvector v associated with the eigenvalue \"λ\" to be any vector that, given \"λ\", satisfies Equation (). Given the eigenvalue, the zero vector is among the vectors that satisfy Equation (), so the zero vector is included among the eigenvectors by this alternate definition.\n\nIf \"λ\" is an eigenvalue of \"T\", then the operator (\"T\" − \"λI\") is not one-to-one, and therefore its inverse (\"T\" − \"λI\") does not exist. The converse is true for finite-dimensional vector spaces, but not for infinite-dimensional vector spaces. In general, the operator (\"T\" − \"λI\") may not have an inverse even if \"λ\" is not an eigenvalue.\n\nFor this reason, in functional analysis eigenvalues can be generalized to the spectrum of a linear operator \"T\" as the set of all scalars \"λ\" for which the operator (\"T\" − \"λI\") has no bounded inverse. The spectrum of an operator always contains all its eigenvalues but is not limited to them.\n\nOne can generalize the algebraic object that is acting on the vector space, replacing a single operator acting on a vector space with an algebra representation – an associative algebra acting on a module. The study of such actions is the field of representation theory.\n\nThe representation-theoretical concept of weight is an analog of eigenvalues, while \"weight vectors\" and \"weight spaces\" are the analogs of eigenvectors and eigenspaces, respectively.\n\nThe simplest difference equations have the form\n\nThe solution of this equation for \"x\" in terms of \"t\" is found by using its characteristic equation\n\nwhich can be found by stacking into matrix form a set of equations consisting of the above difference equation and the \"k\" – 1 equations formula_170 giving a \"k\"-dimensional system of the first order in the stacked variable vector formula_171 in terms of its once-lagged value, and taking the characteristic equation of this system's matrix. This equation gives \"k\" characteristic roots formula_172 for use in the solution equation\n\nA similar procedure is used for solving a differential equation of the form\n\nThe calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is a topic where theory, as presented in elementary linear algebra textbooks, is often very far from practice.\n\nThe classical method is to first find the eigenvalues, and then calculate the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. It is in several ways poorly suited for non-exact arithmetics such as floating-point.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix formula_29 can be determined by finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial. This is easy for formula_176 matrices, but the difficulty increases rapidly with the size of the matrix.\n\nIn theory, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial can be computed exactly, since they are sums of products of matrix elements; and there are algorithms that can find all the roots of a polynomial of arbitrary degree to any required accuracy. However, this approach is not viable in practice because the coefficients would be contaminated by unavoidable round-off errors, and the roots of a polynomial can be an extremely sensitive function of the coefficients (as exemplified by Wilkinson's polynomial). Even for matrices whose elements are integers the calculation becomes nontrivial, because the sums are very long; the constant term is the determinant, which for an formula_177 is a sum of formula_178 different products.\n\nExplicit algebraic formulas for the roots of a polynomial exist only if the degree formula_56 is 4 or less. According to the Abel–Ruffini theorem there is no general, explicit and exact algebraic formula for the roots of a polynomial with degree 5 or more. (Generality matters because any polynomial with degree formula_56 is the characteristic polynomial of some companion matrix of order formula_56.) Therefore, for matrices of order 5 or more, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors cannot be obtained by an explicit algebraic formula, and must therefore be computed by approximate numerical methods. Even the exact formula for the roots of a degree 3 polynomial is numerically impractical.\n\nOnce the (exact) value of an eigenvalue is known, the corresponding eigenvectors can be found by finding nonzero solutions of the eigenvalue equation, that becomes a system of linear equations with known coefficients. For example, once it is known that 6 is an eigenvalue of the matrix\nwe can find its eigenvectors by solving the equation formula_183, that is\nThis matrix equation is equivalent to two linear equations\n\nBoth equations reduce to the single linear equation formula_187. Therefore, any vector of the form formula_188, for any nonzero real number formula_189, is an eigenvector of formula_29 with eigenvalue formula_191.\n\nThe matrix formula_29 above has another eigenvalue formula_193. A similar calculation shows that the corresponding eigenvectors are the nonzero solutions of formula_194, that is, any vector of the form formula_195, for any nonzero real number formula_196.\n\nThe converse approach, of first seeking the eigenvectors and then determining each eigenvalue from its eigenvector, turns out to be far more tractable for computers. The easiest algorithm here consists of picking an arbitrary starting vector and then repeatedly multiplying it with the matrix (optionally normalising the vector to keep its elements of reasonable size); this makes the vector converge towards an eigenvector. A variation is to instead multiply the vector by formula_197; this causes it to converge to an eigenvector of the eigenvalue closest to formula_198.\n\nIf formula_199 is (a good approximation of) an eigenvector of formula_29, then the corresponding eigenvalue can be computed as\n\nwhere formula_202 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_199.\n\nEfficient, accurate methods to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of arbitrary matrices were not known until the QR algorithm was designed in 1961. Combining the Householder transformation with the LU decomposition results in an algorithm with better convergence than the QR algorithm. For large Hermitian sparse matrices, the Lanczos algorithm is one example of an efficient iterative method to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, among several other possibilities.\n\nMost numeric methods that compute the eigenvalues of a matrix also determine a set of corresponding eigenvectors as a by-product of the computation, although sometimes implementors choose to discard the eigenvector information as soon as it is no longer needed.\n\nThe following table presents some example transformations in the plane along with their 2×2 matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.\nThe characteristic equation for a rotation is a quadratic equation with discriminant formula_204, which is a negative number whenever is not an integer multiple of 180°. Therefore, except for these special cases, the two eigenvalues are complex numbers, formula_205; and all eigenvectors have non-real entries. Indeed, except for those special cases, a rotation changes the direction of every nonzero vector in the plane.\n\nA linear transformation that takes a square to a rectangle of the same area (a squeeze mapping) has reciprocal eigenvalues.\n\nAn example of an eigenvalue equation where the transformation formula_206 is represented in terms of a differential operator is the time-independent Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics:\n\nwhere formula_119, the Hamiltonian, is a second-order differential operator and formula_209, the wavefunction, is one of its eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_210, interpreted as its energy.\n\nHowever, in the case where one is interested only in the bound state solutions of the Schrödinger equation, one looks for formula_209 within the space of square integrable functions. Since this space is a Hilbert space with a well-defined scalar product, one can introduce a basis set in which formula_209 and formula_119 can be represented as a one-dimensional array (i.e., a vector) and a matrix respectively. This allows one to represent the Schrödinger equation in a matrix form.\n\nThe bra–ket notation is often used in this context. A vector, which represents a state of the system, in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions is represented by formula_214. In this notation, the Schrödinger equation is:\n\nwhere formula_214 is an eigenstate of formula_119 and formula_210 represents the eigenvalue. formula_119 is an observable self adjoint operator, the infinite-dimensional analog of Hermitian matrices. As in the matrix case, in the equation above formula_220 is understood to be the vector obtained by application of the transformation formula_119 to formula_214.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, and in particular in atomic and molecular physics, within the Hartree–Fock theory, the atomic and molecular orbitals can be defined by the eigenvectors of the Fock operator. The corresponding eigenvalues are interpreted as ionization potentials via Koopmans' theorem. In this case, the term eigenvector is used in a somewhat more general meaning, since the Fock operator is explicitly dependent on the orbitals and their eigenvalues. Thus, if one wants to underline this aspect, one speaks of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Such equations are usually solved by an iteration procedure, called in this case self-consistent field method. In quantum chemistry, one often represents the Hartree–Fock equation in a non-orthogonal basis set. This particular representation is a generalized eigenvalue problem called Roothaan equations.\n\nIn geology, especially in the study of glacial till, eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used as a method by which a mass of information of a clast fabric's constituents' orientation and dip can be summarized in a 3-D space by six numbers. In the field, a geologist may collect such data for hundreds or thousands of clasts in a soil sample, which can only be compared graphically such as in a Tri-Plot (Sneed and Folk) diagram, or as a Stereonet on a Wulff Net.\n\nThe output for the orientation tensor is in the three orthogonal (perpendicular) axes of space. The three eigenvectors are ordered formula_223 by their eigenvalues formula_224; formula_225 then is the primary orientation/dip of clast, formula_226 is the secondary and formula_227 is the tertiary, in terms of strength. The clast orientation is defined as the direction of the eigenvector, on a compass rose of 360°. Dip is measured as the eigenvalue, the modulus of the tensor: this is valued from 0° (no dip) to 90° (vertical). The relative values of formula_228, formula_229, and formula_230 are dictated by the nature of the sediment's fabric. If formula_231, the fabric is said to be isotropic. If formula_232, the fabric is said to be planar. If formula_233, the fabric is said to be linear.\n\nThe eigendecomposition of a symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix yields an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors, each of which has a nonnegative eigenvalue. The orthogonal decomposition of a PSD matrix is used in multivariate analysis, where the sample covariance matrices are PSD. This orthogonal decomposition is called principal component analysis (PCA) in statistics. PCA studies linear relations among variables. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix (in which each variable is scaled to have its sample variance equal to one). For the covariance or correlation matrix, the eigenvectors correspond to principal components and the eigenvalues to the variance explained by the principal components. Principal component analysis of the correlation matrix provides an orthogonal basis for the space of the observed data: In this basis, the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components that are associated with most of the covariability among a number of observed data.\n\nPrincipal component analysis is used to study large data sets, such as those encountered in bioinformatics, data mining, chemical research, psychology, and in marketing. PCA is also popular in psychology, especially within the field of psychometrics. In Q methodology, the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix determine the Q-methodologist's judgment of \"practical\" significance (which differs from the statistical significance of hypothesis testing; cf. criteria for determining the number of factors). More generally, principal component analysis can be used as a method of factor analysis in structural equation modeling.\n\nEigenvalue problems occur naturally in the vibration analysis of mechanical structures with many degrees of freedom. The eigenvalues are the natural frequencies (or eigenfrequencies) of vibration, and the eigenvectors are the shapes of these vibrational modes. In particular, undamped vibration is governed by\n\nor\n\nthat is, acceleration is proportional to position (i.e., we expect formula_121 to be sinusoidal in time).\n\nIn formula_56 dimensions, formula_238 becomes a mass matrix and formula_69 a stiffness matrix. Admissible solutions are then a linear combination of solutions to the generalized eigenvalue problem\n\nwhere formula_241 is the eigenvalue and formula_242 is the (imaginary) angular frequency. The principal vibration modes are different from the principal compliance modes, which are the eigenvectors of formula_69 alone. Furthermore, damped vibration, governed by\n\nleads to a so-called quadratic eigenvalue problem,\n\nThis can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem by algebraic manipulation at the cost of solving a larger system.\n\nThe orthogonality properties of the eigenvectors allows decoupling of the differential equations so that the system can be represented as linear summation of the eigenvectors. The eigenvalue problem of complex structures is often solved using finite element analysis, but neatly generalize the solution to scalar-valued vibration problems.\n\nIn image processing, processed images of faces can be seen as vectors whose components are the brightnesses of each pixel. The dimension of this vector space is the number of pixels. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix associated with a large set of normalized pictures of faces are called eigenfaces; this is an example of principal component analysis. They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of some of them. In the facial recognition branch of biometrics, eigenfaces provide a means of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes. Research related to eigen vision systems determining hand gestures has also been made.\n\nSimilar to this concept, eigenvoices represent the general direction of variability in human pronunciations of a particular utterance, such as a word in a language. Based on a linear combination of such eigenvoices, a new voice pronunciation of the word can be constructed. These concepts have been found useful in automatic speech recognition systems for speaker adaptation.\n\nIn mechanics, the eigenvectors of the moment of inertia tensor define the principal axes of a rigid body. The tensor of moment of inertia is a key quantity required to determine the rotation of a rigid body around its center of mass.\n\nIn solid mechanics, the stress tensor is symmetric and so can be decomposed into a diagonal tensor with the eigenvalues on the diagonal and eigenvectors as a basis. Because it is diagonal, in this orientation, the stress tensor has no shear components; the components it does have are the principal components.\n\nIn spectral graph theory, an eigenvalue of a graph is defined as an eigenvalue of the graph's adjacency matrix formula_29, or (increasingly) of the graph's Laplacian matrix due to its discrete Laplace operator, which is either formula_247 (sometimes called the \"combinatorial Laplacian\") or formula_248 (sometimes called the \"normalized Laplacian\"), where formula_32 is a diagonal matrix with formula_250 equal to the degree of vertex formula_251, and in formula_252, the formula_253th diagonal entry is formula_254. The formula_69th principal eigenvector of a graph is defined as either the eigenvector corresponding to the formula_69th largest or formula_69th smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian. The first principal eigenvector of the graph is also referred to merely as the principal eigenvector.\n\nThe principal eigenvector is used to measure the centrality of its vertices. An example is Google's PageRank algorithm. The principal eigenvector of a modified adjacency matrix of the World Wide Web graph gives the page ranks as its components. This vector corresponds to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain represented by the row-normalized adjacency matrix; however, the adjacency matrix must first be modified to ensure a stationary distribution exists. The second smallest eigenvector can be used to partition the graph into clusters, via spectral clustering. Other methods are also available for clustering.\n\nThe basic reproduction number (formula_258) is a fundamental number in the study of how infectious diseases spread. If one infectious person is put into a population of completely susceptible people, then formula_258 is the average number of people that one typical infectious person will infect. The generation time of an infection is the time, formula_260, from one person becoming infected to the next person becoming infected. In a heterogeneous population, the next generation matrix defines how many people in the population will become infected after time formula_260 has passed. formula_258 is then the largest eigenvalue of the next generation matrix.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The existence of CTICs were first revealed by Dana Priest in a November 17, 2005 \"Washington Post\" article, while she referred to the Alliance Base in a July 2, 2005, article. The name was chosen in reference of Al Qaeda, which means \"The Base\" in Arabic. It was headed by a French General assigned to the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), and largely funded by the CIA's Counterterrorist Center. It hosted officers from Great Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and the United States and was used for intelligence exchange and operational planning. Its existence was confirmed on 8 September 2006 by Christophe Chaboud, chief of the UCLAT (\"\"Unité de Coordination de la Lutte contre le Terrorisme\"\", \"Fight against Terrorism Coordination Unit\"), in an interview to RFI. Although intelligence exchange between intelligence agencies has become more and more widespread in the last decade, in particular following the September 11, 2001 attacks, this organisation also engaged in operations.\n\nIts existence was first revealed by a November 17, 2005, article by Dana Priest in \"The Washington Post\", who also broke the story concerning the existence of the CIA's \"black sites\". In the article, both the CIA and the French government declined to comment on Alliance Base, while all intelligence officers requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the project, in particular relating to its political and judicial dimensions. \"No country wanted to be perceived as taking direction from the CIA,\" wrote Dana Priest, while France was the only European state willing to engage in more than simple information exchange. \"To play down the U.S. role, the center's working language is French,\" told an anonymous source to the Washington Post investigative reporter. \"The base selects its cases carefully, chooses a lead country for each operation, and that country's service runs the operation.\" Furthermore, this cooperation permits \"German case officers to read information from their own country's law enforcement authorities\", which is prohibited by German law.\n\nAlliance Base also takes advantage of the \"harsh laws\" of France concerning anti-terrorism. French magistrates are allowed to detain people suspected of \"conspiracy in relation to terrorism\" while gathering evidence. According to the top anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis Bruguière, he has in the past ordered the arrest of more than 500 suspects, some with the assistance of US authorities. Dana Priest cited him as saying: \"I have good connections with the CIA and FBI.\" Dana Priest described the working of Alliance Base, writing that \"The CIA brings money from its classified and ever-growing 'foreign liaison' account — it has paid to transport some of France's suspects from abroad into Paris for legal imprisonment' [thus rendering them to France] — and its global eavesdropping capabilities and worldwide intelligence service ties.\" France, on the other hand, \"brings its harsh laws, surveillance of radical Muslim groups and their network in Arab states, and its intelligence links to its former colonies\".\n\nBy reporting information to its counterparts, French intelligence agencies helped the US convict Ahmed Ressam, arrested in 1999, as well as Zacarias Moussaoui, who lived a long time in France.\n\nIn the days following the 9/11 attacks, President Jacques Chirac issued an edict to French secret services ordering them to share information with US counterparts \"as if they were your own service,\" according to two officials who read it and were cited by Dana Priest. According to the \"Washington Post\" investigative reporter, the arrest of Christian Ganczarski, alleged to be a senior Al Qaeda leader, was one of the 12 major operations it conducted during its first years. Since the end of 2001, France has detained about 60 suspects, some with the help of the CIA, according to a CIA veteran cited by Priest.\n\nPierre de Bousquet de Florian, director of the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DST), said \"There's easy exchange of information. The cooperation between my service and the American service is candid, loyal and certainly effective.\" Jean-Louis Brugière, on the other hand, was quoted by Dana Priest as saying that \"The relations between intelligence agencies in the United States and France has been good, even during the transatlantic dispute over Iraq, for practical reasons\".\n\nJohn E. McLaughlin, former director of the CIA, has claimed that the cooperation between the DGSE and the CIA \"is one the best of the world\".\n\nChristian Ganczarski, a German convert to Islam, took an Air France flight from Riyadh on June 3, 2003, back to Germany, with a change of planes in Paris. But he was secretly followed on board by an undercover officer. In Paris' airport, a senior CIA officer was waiting for him, while French authorities separated him from his family and arrested him, on charges of association with terrorists. This operation was conceived at the Alliance Base.\n\nOn May 20, 2003, Alliance Base learned that Ahmed Mehdi, who lived near Ganczarksi in Germany, was about to travel for a 14-day vacation to La Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean. Although the German BND thought that he was planning an attack, they had not enough evidence to arrest him. The CIA arranged someone to suggest that Mehdi stop in Paris on his way to La Réunion. The French services clandestinely helped him to have a visa, while the Germans monitored calls and contacts. On June 1, 2003, he was arrested by French authorities at Charles de Gaulle Airport and sent to Fresnes Prison. Two days later, Ganczarksi was also there.\n\nFollowing interrogations of both men, investigators suspected that they had links with the Hamburg cell, which plotted the September 11 attacks. Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy implicitly referred to Alliance Base on June 11, 2003, declaring to the National Assembly that \"This arrest took place thanks to the perfect collaboration between the services of the great democracies.\"\n\n"}

Churches usually hold the week-long events during the summer, though the lengths of such programs may vary, and they are sometimes held during other times of the year.\n\nThe origins of Vacation Bible School can be traced back to Hopedale, Illinois in 1894. Sunday school teacher D. T. Miles, who also was a public school teacher, felt she was limited by time constraints in teaching the Bible to children. So, she started a daily Bible school to teach children during the summer. The first Bible school enrolled forty students and lasted four weeks. A local school was used for classes, while an adjoining park was used for recess.\n\nIn 1898 Virginia Sinclair Hawes (often identified as \"Mrs. Walker Aylett Hawes\"), director of the children's department at Epiphany Baptist Church in New York City, started an \"Everyday Bible School\" for neighborhood children during the summer at a rented beer parlor in New York's East Side. There is a bronze plaque honoring her efforts located in her hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia in the foyer of First Baptist Church.\n\nRobert Boville of the Baptist Mission Society became aware of the Hawes' summer program and recommended it to other Baptist churches. Boville established a handful of summer schools which were taught by students at the Union Theological Seminary. During one summer, one thousand students were enrolled in five different schools. In 1922, he founded the World Association of Daily Vacation Bible School.\n\nOne year later, \"Standard Publishing\" produced the very first printed VBS curriculum. Enough material was provided for a five-week course for three age levels (kindergarten, primary, and junior).\n\nWhile not under the title of Vacation Bible School, Dr. Abraham L. Latham of the Third Presbyterian Church in Chester, Pennsylvania initiated a five-week, four hour per day summer bible school in 1912 which at its peak had 650–700 students. This has been claimed to be the world's first summer bible school.\n\nToday, many churches run their own Vacation Bible School programs without being under the umbrella of a national organization. Some churches opt to use themed curriculum programs such as under the sea, etc. from their respective denominations or independent publishing houses which provide easy preparation and include marketing tools.\n\nModern programs usually consist of a week-long program of religious education which may employ Bible stories, religious song, arts and crafts, skits, or puppet shows which cater toward elementary school-aged children. Groups of local churches who do not have the resources to run VBS for the entire summer may elect to coordinate their schedules to provide continuous childcare.\n\nMost churches provide VBS programs at no cost to those attending. Some churches, however, may charge a fee for the program. The cost, if any, is established by the church.\n\nStudies have show VBS is on the decline. \"Barna Research\" found 81 percent of U.S. churches offering VBS in 1997, by 2012 that number had dropped to 68 percent.\n\n"}

He served as Secretary at War in 1712 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1713 during the reign of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne (1702–1714). He was a Jacobite leader firmly opposed to the Hanoverian succession and was leader of the Tory opposition in the House of Commons during the reign of King George I (1714–1727) and during the early years of King George II (1727–1760).\n\nHis first wife was Lady Catherine Seymour, the younger of the two daughters of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (died 1748), and in her children by Wyndham, heiress to half of the vast estates, including Petworth House in Sussex and Egremont Castle in Cumberland, formerly held by the extinct Percy family, Earls of Northumberland. As a result of this complex inheritance his eldest son became the 2nd Earl of Egremont. Both his sons became earls and his daughter Elizabeth Wyndham was both the wife and mother of Prime Ministers, namely George Grenville and William Wyndham Grenville respectively.\n\nHe built the pier at Watchet harbour, near Orchard Wyndham.\n\nHe was the son and heir of Sir Edward Wyndham, 2nd Baronet (c. 1667 – 1695) of Orchard Wyndham, three times Member of Parliament for Ilchester, Somerset, by his wife Katherine Leveson-Gower, eldest daughter of Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. As a young man while at Rome on his Grand Tour he was approached by a fortune teller who warned him to \"beware of a white horse\". A similar prophecy was made to him later in England. He later surmised that the white horse in question represented the \"Saxon Steed\" in the coat of arms of the King of Hanover, King George I of England, shown in the 4th quarter of the royal arms of England, his opposition to whom would later cause him much trouble.\n\nHe entered parliament as Member of Parliament for Somerset at a by-election on 26 April 1710 and was returned again at the 1710 British general election. He became Secretary at War in the Tory ministry in 1712 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1713. He was closely associated with the radical Tory leader Lord Bolingbroke and was privy to the attempts made to bring about a Jacobite restoration on the death of Queen Anne (1702–1714). On the failure of the plot he was dismissed from office, and in 1714 was briefly imprisoned.\n\nAt the start of the reign of the Hanoverian King George I (1714–1727), Bolingbroke fled into exile in France to join the court of the Old Pretender, and Wyndham took his place in England as the leader of the Jacobites. A rebellion to oust King George was planned for the summer of 1715, and Wyndham sent a message to the Pretender in July \"not to lose a day in going over\". However, the rebellion was discovered and Wyndham's role was laid before the cabinet, attended by both the king and the 6th Duke of Somerset, Wyndham's father-in-law, who although a member of the Whig government and a firm supporter of the Hanoverian Succession, wanted to protect his son-in-law from arrest, and thus volunteered to \"be responsible for him\". Most ministers were inclined to agree to this for fear of offending a person of such consequence, yet Lord Townshend, Secretary of State for the Northern Department, in the belief that the government needed to show firmness, moved the motion to have him arrested. Ten minutes of silence ensued while the other ministers considered their own responses, and finally two or three others seconded the motion and the arrest was decreed by the king, who on retiring to his closet took Townshend's hand and told him: \"you have done me a great service today\".\n\nLord Stanhope brought down to the Commons a message from the King, desiring their consent for apprehending six members of their House on a charge of \"being engaged in a design to support the intended invasion of the kingdom\", namely Sir William Wyndham, Sir John Pakington, 4th Baronet, Edward Harvey (MP for Clitheroe), Thomas Forster, John Anstis, and Corbet Kynaston. Consent was granted. Harvey and Anstis were in London, and were at once taken. Harvey stabbed himself in the breast in two or three places but his wounds were not mortal. Forster escaped and served as General of the Jacobite army in the 1715 Uprising.\nAccordingly Colonel John Huske of the \"foot-guards\" (i.e. Coldstream Guards), at about this time an aide-de-camp to William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, was sent to arrest Wyndham at home at Orchard Wyndham. The story is related in detail by the contemporary commentator Boyer (1716). He was awoken at 5 in the morning and on searching his bedroom the colonel found incriminating papers in his waistcoat pocket, which listed his co-conspirators who planned to invade England and place the Old Pretender on the throne. The colonel had orders to \"use him with decorum\" and trusted Wyndham when he gave his word that at 7 am, having dressed and said goodbye to his pregnant wife, he would be dressed and ready to depart as the colonel's prisoner, and would even lay on his own coach and six horses for the purpose. Wyndham however escaped by the third unguarded door of his chamber and fled, it is said by having jumped out of a window onto a waiting horse. This caused the king to circulate a hand-bill headed \"Proclamation for apprehending Sir William Wyndham, Baronett\", dated 23 September 1715, which offered a huge reward of £1,000 for his capture.\n\nSeeing that his case was hopeless, having for a while disguised himself as a clergyman, he visited his father-in-law the Duke of Somerset at his seat of Syon House, near London. From there he went to London and surrendered himself to the Duke's son and his brother-in-law the Earl of Hertford, a captain in the King's Lifeguards, and was taken into custody in the Tower of London. The 6th Duke of Somerset offered bail to the council for Wyndham's liberty, which was refused. It was soon after having made that offer that the king dismissed him from the high office of Master of the Horse.\n\nUnder King George I (1714–1727) and during the early years of King George II (1727–1760) Wyndham was the leader of the Tory opposition in the House of Commons and fought for his High Church and Tory principles against Sir Robert Walpole. He was in constant communication with the exiled Bolingbroke and after 1723 was actively associated with him in abortive plans for the overthrow of Walpole.\n\nHe appears as \"Gumdahm\" in the parliamentary reports published from 1738 onwards under the title of the \"Debates in the Senate of Magna Lilliputia\" in the Gentleman's Magazine, in which to circumvent the prohibition of the publication of parliamentary debates the real names of the various debaters were replaced by pseudonyms and anagrams and the debates reported were stated to have been \"those of that country which Gulliver had so lately rendered illustrious, and which untimely death had prevented that enterprising traveller from publishing himself\", that is to say works of fiction in the style of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. The published speeches, including some of those of William Pitt, were in fact often literary masterpieces wholly invented by the magazine's contributors, including William Guthrie and Samuel Johnson.\n\nDespite these various enmities, Wyndham was a respected participant in public life in London. He was one of the founding governors of the Foundling Hospital, as recorded in that charity's royal charter of 1739. This was perhaps due to the fact that his father-in-law the 6th Duke of Somerset became a founding governor after his second wife, Charlotte Finch (1711–1773), became the first to sign the petition to King George II of its founder Captain Thomas Coram. This institution, the country's first and only children's home for foundlings, was then London's most fashionable charity and Wyndham served as a governor with such other notables as Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, Henry Pelham, Arthur Onslow, Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton and even Sir Robert Walpole himself.\n\nWyndham married twice. His first marriage was to Lady Catherine Seymour, the younger of the two daughters of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, KG (1662–1748), and sister of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684–1750). On her brother's death in 1750 she became (with the 7th Duke's only daughter Lady Elizabeth Seymour and her husband Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet) one of two co-heirs to the vast estates formerly belonging to the ancient Percy family, former Earls of Northumberland, including of Egremont Castle in Cumberland and of the jewel in the crown Petworth House in Sussex, rebuilt in palatial style by her father the 6th Duke, whose first wife had been the great heiress Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722), only daughter and sole heiress of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670) of Petworth House and Alnwick Castle in Northumberland.\n\nBy his wife Lady Catherine Seymour he had two sons and three daughters including:\n\n\nSir William's second wife was Maria Catherina de Jonge, the widow of William Godolphin, Marquess of Blandford.\n\nHe died at Wells, Somerset, on 17 June 1740, after having fallen from his horse (\"white of course\"), whilst out hunting.\n\nPortraits of Sir William Wyndham survive at Orchard Wyndham, Petworth House and other Wyndham family properties\n"}

It was brought to market by Hoechst Marion Roussel (now Sanofi-Aventis) and was marketed under various brand names, including Seldane in the United States, Triludan in the United Kingdom, and Teldane in Australia. It was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of a particular type of disruption of the electrical rhythms of the heart (specifically cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation) and has been withdrawn from markets worldwide.\n\nTerfenadine acts as a peripherally-selective antihistamine, or antagonist of the histamine H receptor. It is a prodrug, generally completely metabolized to the active form fexofenadine in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, terfenadine normally is not measurable in the plasma. Terfenadine itself, however, is cardiotoxic at higher doses, while its major active metabolite is not. Terfenadine, in addition to its antihistamine effects, also acts as a potassium channel blocker (K11.1 encoded by the gene \"hERG\"). Since its active metabolite is not a potassium channel blocker, no cardiotoxicity is associated with fexofenadine. Toxicity is possible after years of continued use with no previous problems as a result of an interaction with other medications such as erythromycin, or foods such as grapefruit. The addition of, or a dosage increase in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove terfenadine. In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm (e.g. ventricular tachycardia and \"torsades de pointes\").\n\nIn the United States, Seldane was brought to market in 1985 as the first nonsedating antihistamine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In June 1990, evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking Seldane prompted the FDA to issue a report on the risk factors associated with concomitant use of the drug with macrolide antibiotics and ketoconazole. Two months later, the FDA required the manufacturer to send a letter to all physicians, alerting them to the problem; in July 1992, the existing precautions were elevated to a black box warning and the issue attracted mass media attention in reports that people with liver disease or who took ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, or the antibiotic erythromycin, could suffer cardiac arrhythmia if they also took Seldane.\n\nIn January 1997, the same month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had earlier approved a generic version of Seldane made by IVAX Corporation of Miami, the FDA recommended terfenadine-containing drugs be removed from the market and physicians consider alternative medications for their patients. Seldane (and Seldane-D, terfenadine combined with the decongestant pseudoephedrine) were removed from the U.S. market by their manufacturer in late 1997 after the FDA approval of Allegra-D (fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine). Terfenadine-containing drugs were subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1999, and are no longer available for prescription in the UK.\n\n"}

The park is situated around a steep gorge in which the Falling Water River drops in elevation in less than a mile, culminating in a cataract waterfall.\n\nThe Burgess Falls State Natural Area, which covers , is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.\n\nThe Falling Water River rises near the base of the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Putnam County and winds its way across the Highland Rim to its mouth along the Center Hill Lake impoundment of the Caney Fork, which is located in an area where the Highland Rim drops off into the Central Basin. The Burgess Falls State Natural Area comprises the section of the river just above its mouth, where the river drops from roughly atop the Highland Rim to just over at Center Hill Lake.\n\nOver a long period of time, the Falling Water River's rapids have cut a deep gorge just above its mouth. The river drops to the Central Basin in a series of cascades and waterfalls, each gaining in size and intensity as the river approaches Center Hill Lake. At the Falling Water Cascades, located just downstream from the old Burgess Falls Dam, the river gradually spills over a embankment of rocks. Almost immediately downstream from the Cascades, the river drops another at Little Falls. Beyond Little Falls, where the river briefly bends to the north, is an cascade known as Middle Falls. Downstream from Middle Falls, where the river bends westward again, is the Burgess Falls. The distance between Falling Water Cascades and Burgess Falls is less than a mile. Burgess Falls spills into a large limestone gorge enclosed by sheer walls high. The Falling Water River enters Center Hill Lake downstream from Burgess Falls.\n\nBurgess Falls is named after Tom Burgess, a Revolutionary War veteran who settled along this section of the Falling Water River in the 1810s. The Burgess family used the river's rapids to power a grist mill and eventually a saw mill which supplied early settlers with corn meal and lumber.\n\nIn 1924, the City of Cookeville built an earthen dam along the river a mile or so upstream from Burgess Falls. After a flood destroyed the dam in 1928, the city replaced it with a concrete dam that provided the area with electricity until the arrival of the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1944. Due in large part to calls from Cookevillians to protect the area, Burgess Falls State Park was established in 1971. Part of a pipeline bridge still spans the river in the vicinity of Little Falls. The pipeline originally crossed the river into a tunnel on the north walls of the gorge and emerged to cross the river again near Middle Falls en route to a powerhouse.\n\nThe entrance to Burgess Falls State Park is located just off Tennessee State Route 135 roughly halfway between Cookeville and Sparta. The park is open year-round, but is closed on days of high precipitation due to the Falling Water River's volatility.\n\nA loop trail follows the bluffs along the south bank of the gorge, starting at Falling Water Cascades and ending at a platform overlooking Burgess Falls. Little Falls and Middle Falls are also visible from the trail. A stairway leads down to the overhang of Burgess Falls and continues down into the gorge. A second loop trail follows the ridgeline southwest of Burgess Falls.\n\nThe Burgess Falls State Natural Area includes Burgess Falls Lake and part of the forest on the both sides of the river in the lake's vicinity.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located between General Santos and Tupi. Polomolok is seated about south-east of the provincial capital city of Koronadal, north of the port city of General Santos and south-east of the national capital Manila. The municipality ranks 21st in the largest income earner municipalities of the Philippines.As of 2016, it is the wealthiest Municipality in Mindanao with PhP 1.47 Billion worth of assets and in 2017, Polomolok is the 7th Most Competitive Municipality in Mindanao for the year 2018. \n\nPolomolok already filed a resolution to the Congress for Polomolok to become a city.<ref name=\" www.meb.news/polomolok-meets-cityhood-requirements/\"></ref>\n\nThe name Polomolok was derived from the B’laan term \"flomlok\", which means hunting ground. In the early years, the place where the Poblacion is presently situated was known for its abundance of wild life. There were no roads and the lowlanders befriended the B’laan highlanders and utilized them as guides. Aside from a rich hunting ground, Polomolok had so many creeks with free flowing water coming from the hillsides. Those cool and clear flowing water encouraged foreigners to settle in this place. One of them was a Japanese trader Zenjiro Takahashi and his B’laan wife. He began clearing the area and planted agricultural crops. Not long after, some of the Christians came to settle and started to clear the area.\n\nIn 1940, the Philippines Commonwealth government embarked on a very bold program of social amelioration. One of the projects was the distribution of lands to interested people who wanted to settle in Mindanao. Settlers were brought by boat to Dadiangas (General Santos) from Luzon and Visayas. On November 2, 1940, Polomolok was officially opened for settlement and known as Polomok Settlement District. Atty. Ernesto Jimenez was appointed as its first overseer. He was responsible for the allocation of farm lots. Then came the creation of some barrios of the settlers. These were Palkan, Lemblisong, Polo, Polomolok Central (now Poblacion), Polomolok Creek (now Magsaysay), Sulit, Lamcaliaf, Kinilis, Glamang, Bentung, Koronadal Proper, Leve, and Silway. The first settlers, after a crop or two, started to invite their friends and relatives to settle in this place, because the soil was so fertile that any crop can survive due to favorable climate conditions.\n\nThe settlement program was interrupted for four years by the Second World War. Don Francisco Natividad was appointed Military Mayor with Datu Badung Nilong as Vice Mayor and Sgt. Nuevarez as Chief of Police. In 1948, Perfecto Balili was designated NLSA Administrator with Rosendo Sarte as Officer-In-Charge. In 1954, the NLSA was abolished in the course of government reorganization. All records of NLSA were taken over by the Board of Liquidators. The Municipality of General Santos (formerly Buayan) was incorporated.\n\nOn August 21, 1957, the Municipality of Polomolok was created by virtue of a Presidential Executive Order No. 264 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia. It started functioning as a regular and independent municipality on September 10, 1957, as a 6th class municipality. The local officials were appointed by the President. Its first appointed Mayor was Datu Badong Nilong.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the progress of this town was still very slow. Fields have always been green, harvest bountiful but farm products had low market value and circulation of cash was rather slow. Then came a breakthrough, when the largest pineapple company, the Dole Philippines Inc., was planted and inaugurated on December 7, 1963.\n\nLocated at the southern part of South Cotabato, Polomolok is nestled at the base of the prominent Mount Matutum. It is cone-shaped volcano and looms over the provinces at high, a unique challenge to mountaineers. It is perhaps the provinces most imposing landmark.\n\nNatural hot and cold spring abound at its foot. Natural springs are abundant within this area and provide free flowing water. Two of these springs have developed into natural resorts.\n\nPolomolok features a tropical rainforest climate (Af), according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, with significant rainfall year round and constantly hot temperatures. Since this tropical rainforest climate is more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and experiences very few cyclones, it is subequatorial. The city experiences considerable rainfall during the year, even during the driest month. The average annual temperature is 25.7 °C in Polomolok. In a year, the average rainfall is 1410 mm. March is the driest month, and June is the wettest month in the city.\n\nPolomolok is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. Barangay Poblacion is also known as Polomolok itself. There are 4 urban barangays and 19 rural barangays.\n\nPolomolok has a population of 152,789 people as per census data of 2015, thus making it the most populated municipality (next to Koronadal City) in the province.\n\nBased on its population, it is the most populous municipality in Mindanao, the largest municipality in the SOCCSKSARGEN Region and 17th most populous municipality in the Philippines. Cebuano is widely spoken and is the native language of majority of the municipality's inhabitants.\n\nThe Municipality of Polomolok prides its successful implementation of its Revenue Generation Program as an exemplary practice. The purpose of the program is to increase local revenues from collection of real property taxes and other fees and charges; update Municipal Tax Ordinance; Conduct Business Tax Mapping; and system automation. Rank 3rd on the rich municipalities and cities in Mindanao with less percentage of poverty incidence.\n\nIt is splendidly gifted with pineapple products and processing, livestock resources (cattle, swine production, meat packaging) furniture, asparagus and cut flowers, cotton ginnery, corn, vegetable and fruits.\nDole Philippines Incorporated is the largest industrial firm involved in growing, processing and exporting of fresh and canned pineapple. As of 2004, the area planted to pineapple is 15,507.872 hectares with an average production volume of 31.94 metric tons per hectare. This industry, which is situated at Barangay Cannery Site, generates about 6,000 jobs at present. It is considered as the biggest taxpayer in the municipality.\n\nCorn is the second most grown crop in the municipality. Data from the Agriculture Office revealed that for the year 2003 there are 3,931 hectares or 13.46% of the total cultivated land agricultural lands were devoted to corn. About 1,236 hectares of which are planted to traditional corn seeds at average production of 3.20 MT/hectare and 2,695 hectares are planted to hybrid corn at average production of 4.0 MT/ hectare. The major producers are Barangay Klinan 6, Glamang, Landan, Silway 8 and Upper Klinan. About 30% of populace adopt corn as their staple food.\n\nRice is also one of the major crops. 99% of the total population has rice as their staple food. Office of the Agriculturist reported that for the year 2006, 445 hectares were utilized for rice production, of which only 300 hectares are irrigated, 45 are lowland, and 100 are upland. Irrigated areas are planted 2.5 time a year while rainfed and upland are planted only once. \"Gintoang Masaganang Ani Program\" Program targets for the average production of rice at about 4.5 MT, for irrigated, 3 MT for lowland and 1.5 MT for upland. This target was met by the farmers this year because of rice diseases and pest infestation.\n\nThe record of the Department of Agriculture shows that as of 2006, the total area planted with asparagus is 1,435.52 hectares. Plantations of this crop are in Barangay Sulit, Sumbakil, Crossing Palkan, Bentung, Lapu, Pagalungan, Lumakil, Rubber and Magsaysay. Farmer growers have access to the export market due to contract agreement with Marsman-Drysdale Agri-Ventures and Tropifresh. The surplus are sold in the local market and diversifically used as supplements for cattle fattening.\nVegetables grow well in Barangay Palkan, Kinilis, Maligo, Sumbakil and Koronadal Proper where the climate is cool and the soil is fertile. However, the farmers cannot really produce in large volume due to financial constraints and unstable prevailing market prices of vegetables.\n\nLivestock and poultry production has increased tremendously in the past years. This is partly due to the municipality's climate and terrain which is ideal for livestock and poultry production. The land area devoted for agri-livestock production is 80 hectares or 0.27 percent of the total agricultural land.\n\nFor the year 2006, the Office of the Municipal Agriculturist reported that there are 322,628 heads of livestocks and poultry raised in the municipality. Poultry has the most number of heads at 271,420 where 3,639 are layers, 17,852 are backyard, and 249,929 are commercial under contract growers scheme with different Agri-business firms such as RFM, Vitarich, and Swift followed by swine with 23,719 heads which 10,970 are backyard and a total of 15,113 are raised commercially, and cattle with 24,491 heads where 2,065 are backyard and a total of 22,426 heads fattened in the cattle farms of Montery and DEALCO.\n\nSupply of livestock in the municipality is insufficient due to shipment of livestock which are raised commercially to other parts of the country leaving the backyard raisers to support the local market. The municipality still depend on supplies coming from other areas in the province.\n\nPolomolok has a total income of PhP 414,171,343.10 as of 2016 certified by the Commission on Audit and Bureau of Local Government Finance. It is a 1st class municipality. \n\nPolomolok is considered as the wealthiest and richest municipality in Mindanao.\n\n\nThe Polomolok Terminal has its daily trip to General Santos City and Koronadal City for 24 hours.\n\nThe estimated time allotment from Polomolok to General Santos and vice versa is only 15~20 minutes.\nFrom General Santos City, there is a 24/7 trip to Polomolok, the PUVs along National Highway near NDDU.\n\nThe General Santos City Seaport is accessible to Polomolok, there used to be daily trips from Manila to General Santos through 2GO Travel and other shipping companies.\n\nGeneral Santos International Airport is 20 minutes away from Polomolok's town proper by using the newly constructed General Santos City Diversion Road (roundabout) to avoid heavy traffic along Lanoy Highway in Barangay Calumpang, General Santos City.\n\nMost of the FM, AM radio and TV stations are based in General Santos City.\n\nAmong the notable hospitals in Polomolok are\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated in SOCCSKSARGEN or Region XII of Mindanao Island, the municipality is seated about south-west of province capital city of Koronadal and about south-south-east of Philippine capital Manila. Based on its urban area, it is 18th biggest municipality of the region and has placed 6th of the biggest towns in South Cotabato.\n\nThe Municipality of Surallah was created by virtue of Republic Act 3420 on June 18, 1961, as later amended by RA 3664 on June 22, 1963. Its history is generally reckoned with the influx of settlers coming from their abilities under the settlements Programs of NLSA; RPC-NDC; NARRA and LASEDECO.\n\nSurallah started as 6th Class Municipality with 26 barrios and a population of 26,162 settling in a vast land area of 97,000 hectares. The rapid growth of its cluster barrios made the support of the new town. The creation of the Municipality of T’boli in 1964 making six (6) barrios integrated in thus, reducing the total land area to 31,200 hectares. Subsequently, three (3) Barangays were created from their mother barangay; hence, the municipality has 23 officials barangay.\n\nLately, the booming tourism industry in the south made to be the primary factor of the birth of the new Municipality of Lake Sebu in 1982, causing the reduction of the total land area and population of Surallah from 31,200 to 31,110 hectares and from 52,703 to 42,467 respectively. The separation of Lake Sebu into Municipality made another reduction in the number of barangay from 23 to 17.\n\nThe influential leadership of the municipality triggered the tremendous growth development from a small span of years from its creation up to 1990. First, the administration of the Jose T. Sison who served the Municipality from 1963 to 1978 until the election for regional representatives caused Mayor Jose T. Sison to become the Assemblyman of Region XI. Former barrio treasurer of Libertad, Federico Magalona, Jr. was appointed to assume the office until the Local Election of January 31, 1980. The concluded poll gave the mayoralty seat to Conrado P. Haguisan to serve from seat Lorenzo Delmo until November 21, 1987, who vacated the post to run in the January 18, 1988 election. From December 1, 1987, to January 31, 1988, former OIC Councilor Sodusta served as OIC Mayor. The election in January 1988 gave back the local leadership to former Assemblyman Jose T. Sison as Municipal Mayor of Surallah who served for three terms until May 1998. The race for Local leadership in May election proved to be competitive among aspirants who had eventually won by Romulo O. Solivio. The new leadership brought necessary changes in the administration more specific on a gradual shift from traditional type to a more conventional way of governance by re-inventing new techniques thru dynamic participative approaches.\n\nThere is no official source of information regarding the origin of the name of the place, but precolonial settlers had reportedly named the place \"Šukran Allâh\", \"šukran\" being the Arabic equivalent of “Thanks be to God.” Colonial-era settelrs from Luzón and the Visayas then later modified the name into \"Surallah\" which loosely means “South of Allah”. The more likely explanation, however, is that the town ultimately takes its name from the Arabic \"Ṯārʾallâh\" (ثارالله), which in Persian is romanized as \"Sārʾallāh\", which in turn is pronounced in its Tajik dialect as /sorolˈloh/. The origin inhabitants of the area are the \"tagabilis\", a mountain tribe people who moved inward after the arrival of the Christian settlers from Luzon and Visayas. The latest census of May 2000 gave Surallah the Officials population count of 66,208.\n\nIn July 1991, Surallah was reclassified from fifth class to third class Municipality being considered as one of the most progressive municipality in the province of South Cotabato. Subsequently, in 1993, it became a second class municipality and later in July 1997 it was reclassified as first class municipality by the Department of Finance.\n\nBanking on the Potentials for Agro-industrial and commercials developments, the administration geared its program toward making Surallah as the Agro-industrial and commercial center for Allah Valley Area where vision is specifically addressed to.\nAs economic activities flourished in the area, more people especially businessmen settled into the place which contributed much to faster pace of development.\n\nThe Municipality’s vision as an Agro-industrial and Commercial center of the Allah valley Area for the coming years continues as it directs its mission towards providing infrastructure developments, economic supports services and facilities to attract and encourage growth of investments in the municipality. Aside from these, the improvement of the social services, the conservation of the natural resources and protection of the environment are also priority development objectives of this fast growing municipality presently serving as the economic center of the Allah Valley Area.\n\nAdministratively the Municipality of Surallah is subdivided into 17 barangays. One forms the center of the municipality whereas the other 16 are in the outlying areas. Some of them are even several kilometers away from the town proper.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Surallah has a population of 76,035 residents and belongs to the 294 cities and municipalities in the Philippines which have more than 50,000 inhabitants but did not reach 100,000 yet. Based on the number of its inhabitants Surallah is number 255 of the most populous municipalities of the Philippines and at 59 in Mindanao Island and at 5 of the most populous municipalities of the province of South Cotabato.\n\nAs economic activities flourished in the area, more people especially businessmen settled into the place, which contributed to a faster pace of development.\nts functional role is an Alternate Provincial Agro-industrial Center. While being a major producer of corn and rice, Surallah has explored its vast potential for progress.\n\nRecognized as the champion-advocate of the Clean and Green Program, Surallah envisions the integral development of the municipality and the people. Through the USWAG Surallah Program, a multi-sectoral approach to addressing the main thrust of its people, Surallah is certain to be the next leading agri-industrial zone in the province of South Cotabato.\n\nAgriculture is the major economy of Surallah, but multinational companies like Dole Philippines has constructed a plant in the municipality. Also, major economic boom in the municipality was due to its location. Surallah is in the center of many National Road thus, many businessmen settled here because it is in the center of some municipalities. It is the Economical Center of the Upper Valley Area, which is composed of all the municipalities of Tboli, Lake Sebu, Banga, Norala, Santo Nino and Surallah. Together they function like a metropolitan area with Surallah as its Central Business District.\nSurallah has an average income of PhP 147,499,170.72 as of 2010, certified by the Commission on Audit. According to the Philippine income classification for provinces (cities and municipalities), Surallah is a 1st class municipality.\n\nThe Surallah Integrated Public Terminal (SIPT) has trips every 30 minutes every day to Tboli, Lake Sebu and Koronadal (6:00am–7:00pm) 4x daily trip to General Santos City and for bus, there is a trip to Koronadal City every 30 minutes (6:00am–7:00pm) daily and 6x a day trip to Tacurong City with a stop to Isulan.\n\nAllah Valley Airport serves the general area of Surallah. It is located in the Allah Valley.\nThe airport is classified by the Air Transportation Office as a secondary airport, or a minor commercial domestic airport.\nToday, there are no commercial flights in this airport because of its obsolete facilities and Cotabato and General Santos are handling commercial flights\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2161465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161465", "title": "Enchey Monastery", "text": "Enchey Monastery\n\nThe Enchey Monastery was established in 1909 above Gangtok, the capital city of Sikkim in the Northeastern Indian state. It belongs to the Nyingma order of Vajrayana Buddhism. The monastery built around the then small hamlet of Gangtok became a religious centre. The location was blessed by Lama Drupthob Karpo, a renowned exponent of tantric (adept) art in Buddhism with flying powers; initially a small Gompa was established by him after he flew from Maenam Hill in South Sikkim to this site. The literal meaning of Enchey Monastery is the \"Solitary Monastery\". Its sacredness is attributed to the belief that Khangchendzonga and Yabdean – the protecting deities – reside in this monastery. As, according to a legend, Guru Padmasambhava had subdued the spirits of the Khangchendzonga, Yabdean and Mahākāla here. In view of this legend, the religious significance of Enchey Monastery is deeply ingrained in every household in Gangtok. It is also believed that these powerful deities always fulfil the wishes of the devotees.\n\nThe monastery is built on a stunning ridge of a hill above the Gangtok city to its northeast from where the Kanchendzonga range is visible. It is located on Gangtok – Nathula road, above the Siniolochu lodge and passes through an avenue of sylvan coniferous trees, bypassing the TV telecommunications tower. It is about from the northeast of the main market place in Gangtok. Even though it is a small monastery situated on a strategic peak overlooking Gangtok, compared to other monasteries in Sikkim, it provides views of the Kanchendzonga peak.\n\nThe monastery was first built in the 1840s by the eighth Chogyal and as a result, Gangtok then a small hamlet became a pilgrimage place. However, the monastery as seen now was aesthetically built in 1909, one of the two in Gangtok, like a Chinese Pagoda during the rule of Sikyong Tulku (1909–1910). The monastery was built at the exact location where Lama Druptub Karbo had his hermitage. The monastery is topped by a shining golden cupola. It houses a number of images of Gods, Goddesses and religious objects. The deities worshipped in the monastery are the Buddha, Loki Sharia and Guru Padmasambhava. The walls of the monastery in the large prayer hall are fully covered with paintings and murals of four religious kings, the deities of the four cardinal directions as stated in the scriptures and the entire galaxy of Mahayan Buddhist deities. Manuscripts of scriptures are kept in an almirah. The four pillars supporting the roof of the monastery are elaborately carved. Built under the Nyingma order, it houses 90 monks. The windows of the monastery are very ornately carved and painted.\n\nThe monastery has a large collection of masks which are used for the annual ritual dances. As its name implies, monastery has a peaceful atmosphere and also maintains a good library.\n\nA very serene atmosphere has been created with the colourful prayer flags fluttering around the monastery. Like all other Nyingmapa monasteries in Sikkim, this monastery is also under the jurisdiction of the Pemayangtse Monastery.\n\nThe monastery was gutted in 1947. However, it was rebuilt in 1948 with the support of the devotees.\n\nIn a reconnaissance report on Sikkim Earthquake of 14 February 2006, it was noted that the Enchey Monastery, apart from other buildings in Sikkim, also suffered severe damages in the 2006 Earthquake (with the maximum intensity of shaking as VII on MSK scale); wide shear and vertical cracks were noted in masonry walls, at corners and near openings. It was not the first time that the monastery, among other masonry structures in Sikkim, was subject to damages by earthquake. Earthquake events in the 1980 and 1988 had also caused damage to the monastery but the repairs done were not adequate, as in 2006, the masonry wall of the building suffered damages again. The report has observed that \"The damage seen in and around Gangtok was clearly disproportionate to the size of the earthquake, which was a moderate 5.7 on the Richter scale. This very clearly establishes the high level of seismic vulnerability of the region. Such disproportionate damage is a direct consequence of poor design and construction practices in an inadequate professional environment that is challenged by the lack of trained human resources in the state.\" Sikkim as a whole, and particularly masonry structures, are vulnerable to suffer damages from such severe earthquakes. Hence, it has been suggested to adopt \"safer constructions through choice of appropriate construction systems, incorporation of earthquake resistant technology, use of good construction materials and their quality control, and involvement of competent manpower for design, construction and supervision.\"\n\nThe Enchey Monastery, a heritage structure built in stone masonry with 500 mm thick walls, is a double storied structure with timber frames making up the columns and beams in the roof and also in the flooring. Galvanised iron sheet roofing is also supported on wooden trusses. The masonry wall was damaged due to seismic shear. The decorative plaster of the walls also fell off due to cracks in the masonry walls and spoiled some of the beauty of the structure. Grouting of the cracks was suggested as a solution to strengthen the damaged portions of the walls.\n\nDetor Cham is the colourful and vibrant Cham dance festival that is held in the monastery during on the 18th and 19th day of the 12th Lunar month of the Tibetan calendar, corresponding to the dates during January/February of the Gregorian calendar. Other festivals observed in the Enchey Monastery are: the Singhe Chaam performed once every three years, Pang Lhabsol commemorating the swearing of blood-brotherhood between the Bhutias and Lepchas in the presence of Khangchendzonga as witness. The Cham dances are mask dances where the dancers wearing ornate robes perform dances representing the Tibetan deity figurines of Mahakala (the protector) and mythical snow lions; both depict a third eye on their foreheads to represent the \"need for inner reflection.\" The dance festivals are usually held prior to the Losar, the Tibetan New Year day (February/March) and Losoong, the Sikkimese New Year (December/January).\n\n\n"}

To date, there are around 34 major poultry raisers scattered in the municipality with minimum of 10,000 heads capacity. Tupi had been identified in the SOCCSKSARGEN Growth Plan as one of the areas where a satellite Food Terminal shall be located. To date, a private organization, the DARBCI initiated the establishment of an initial 70 hectare Economic Zone within the Municipality of Tupi. One of the future investment eyed as an economic booster is the establishment of an Integrated Food Terminal. On this aspect, private investors are welcome to finance major economic endeavors within the economic zone.\n\nTupi, which is basically an agricultural municipality, devotes 19% of its total land area to agricultural production. Major agricultural crops are pineapple, papaya, asparagus, fruits, vegetables, corn, coffee, bananas, cut-flowers.

It was abandoned after the Muslim conquest but was restored as both a Latin Catholic (meanwhile suppressed) and a Coptic Orthodox titular see.\n\nIts remains are located near the modern town of el Ashmunein (from the Coptic name) in Mallawi, Minya Governorate, Egypt.\n\n\"Khemenu\" (\"\"), the Egyptian language name of the city, means \"Eight-Town\", after the Ogdoad, a group of eight \"primordial\" deities whose cult was situated there. The name survived as Coptic \"Shmun\", from which the modern name \"el Ashmunein\" () is derived.\n\nIn Koine Greek, the city was called \"The City of Hermes\" since the Greeks identified Hermes with Thoth, because the city was the main cult centre of Thoth, the Pharaonic god of magic, healing, and wisdom and the patron of scribes. Thoth was associated in the same way with the Phoenician deity Eshmun. Inscriptions at the temple call the god \"The Lord of Eshmun\".\n\nThe city was the capital of the Hare nome (the fifteenth nome of Upper Egypt) in the Heptanomis. Hermopolis stood on the borders of Upper and Lower Egypt, and, for many ages, the Thebaid or upper country extended much further to the north than in more recent periods. As the border town, Hermopolis was a place of great resort and opulence, ranking second to Thebes alone. A little to south of the city was the castle of Hermopolis, at which point rivercraft from the Thebaid paid tolls (, the Bahr Yussef in Arabic). The grottos of Beni Hasan, near Antinoöpolis on the opposite bank of the Nile, were the common cemeteries of the Hermopolitans because although the river divided the city from its necropolis, from the wide curve of the western hills at this point, it was easier to ferry the dead over the water than to transport them by land to the hills.\n\nHermopolis became a significant city in the Roman province of Thebais Prima in the administrative diocese of Egypt.\n\nThe principal pagan deities worshipped at Hermopolis were Typhon (Set) and Thoth. Typhon was represented by a hippopotamus, on which sat a hawk fighting with a serpent. Thoth, whom the ancient Greeks associated with Hermes because they were both gods of magic and writing, was represented by the ibis.\n\nA Christian tradition holds it to be the place where the Holy Family found refuge during its exile in Egypt.\n\nHermopolis Maior was a suffragan diocese of the provincial capital's Metropolitan Archdiocese of Antinoe, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Alexandria. Like most, it faded under Islam.\n\nList of bishops of Hermopolis:\n\nThe city was a titular diocese in the Roman Catholic Church, and still is (?) in the Coptic Orthodox Church.\nThe diocese was nominally restored in the 18th century as Latin Titular bishopric of Hermopolis Maior (Latin; 1925-1929 renamed Hermopolis Magna) / Ermopoli Maggiore (Curiate Italian)\nIts territory was reassigned in 1849 to the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Mina, as a restoration of Hermopolis (as its Latin title attests).\n\nIn 1949 the titular see was suppressed, having had the following incumbents, all of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :\n\nHermopolis comparatively escaped the frequent wars which, in the decline both of the Pharaonic and Roman eras, devastated the Heptanomis; but, on the other hand, its structures have undergone severe changes under its Muslim rulers, who have burned its stones for lime or carried them away for building materials. A surviving Oxyrhynchus Papyrus of the 3rd century AD indicates that high-rise buildings with seven stories existed in the town. The collection of Arabic papyri in the John Rylands Library, Manchester, contains many documents referring to Hermopolis (\"Ushmun\"); they date from the 2nd to 4th centuries AH.\n\nThe Ibis-headed god Thoth was, with his accompanying emblems, the Ibis and the Cynocephalus monkey, the most conspicuous among the sculptures upon the great portico of the temple of Hermopolis. His designation in inscriptions was \"The Lord of Eshmoon\". This portico was a work of the Pharaonic era, but the erections of the Ptolemies at Hermopolis were on a scale of great extent and magnificence and, although raised by Greek monarchs, are essentially Egyptian in their conception and execution. The portico, the only remnant of the temple, consists of a double row of pillars, six in each row. The architraves are formed of five stones; each passes from the centre of one pillar to that of the next, according to a well-known usage with Egyptian builders. The intercolumnation of the centre pillars is wider than that of the others; and the stone over the centre is twenty-five feet and six inches long. These columns were painted yellow, red and blue in alternate bands. There is also a peculiarity in the pillars of the Hermopolitan portico peculiar to themselves, or at least discovered only again in the temple of Gournou. (Dénon, \"L'Egypte\", plate 41.) Instead of being formed of large masses placed horizontally above each other, they are composed of irregular pieces, so artfully adjusted that it is difficult to detect the lines of junction. The bases of these columns represent the lower leaves of the lotus; next come a number of concentric rings, like the hoops of a cask; and above these the pillars appear like bunches of reeds held together by horizontal bonds. Including the capital, each column is about 40 feet high; the greatest circumference is about 28½ feet, about five feet from the ground, for they diminish in thickness both towards the base and towards the capital. The widest part of the intercolumnation is 17 feet; the other pillars are 13 feet apart.\n\nCurrently there is a small open-air museum in which stand two massive statues of Thoth as a baboon worshipping the sun, and a few carved blocks of masonry.\n\n\n\n"}

This earned him a move to English football with Millwall, but Crawford returned to Scotland after just one year. He had a mixed spell with Hibernian, suffering relegation but then winning promotion. Crawford then had the most productive spell of his career with Dunfermline Athletic, during which time he became a Scotland regular, amassing 25 caps in total. Crawford played in three Scottish Cup Finals (two for Dunfermline and one for Dundee United) in the mid-2000s, losing all three to Celtic. Crawford's stint with Dundee United came after a short-lived return to English football with Plymouth Argyle.\n\nAfter short spells with Aberdeen and Dunfermline Athletic, Crawford signed for lower division club East Fife in 2008. He served East Fife as player/manager for just over a year before resigning as manager in October 2010. He has since worked as an assistant manager at Falkirk, Hearts and Milton Keynes Dons.\n\nCrawford, who plays as a striker, began his career with Raith Rovers in 1992. Raith beat Celtic in a penalty shootout in the 1994 Scottish League Cup Final and Crawford scored one of Raith's goals in the final. Raith also played in the UEFA Cup against Bayern Munich.\n\nAfter the 1995–96 season, Crawford moved on to Millwall, where he spent a single season and scored 11 goals. Hibernian signed Crawford in 1997, but were relegated from the top division before winning promotion back to the Scottish Premier League in 1999. Crawford moved to Dunfermline Athletic on loan for the 1999–2000 season, scoring 16 goals in 25 games.\n\nCrawford signed for the Fife side permanently in July 2000 after a successful loan in the previous season. His first goal for the Pars came on 12 August 2000 against St Johnstone. Crawford was Dunfermline's top scorer in his first season at East End Park, scoring 9 goals in 37 league matches. The next season was just as successful for Crawford in goalscoring terms and his goals elevated Dunfermline to finishing sixth in the league. His goal in the final game of the season against Rangers earned his side a 1–1 draw. The 2002–03 season was perhaps Crawford's best season with the Pars. The third game of the season saw him score a hat-trick against Dundee leading to him challenging for top scorer of the season with 19 goals in 35 games. Crawford's goals again helped the Pars move up the league, helping them finish fifth overall.\n\nHis final season at Dunfermline was the club most successful season in a number of years, which saw them finish 4th thanks to Crawford's 13 goals. This not only saw his side qualify for the UEFA Cup, but he also helped the Pars reach the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 3–1 to Celtic. It was at this time that Crawford decided he wanted to leave Dunfermline to sign for a club in England.\n\nCrawford signed for Football League Championship side Plymouth Argyle in 2004. He failed to settle in England due to his homesickness. After only six months he returned to Scotland, signing with Dundee United for a £80,000 fee. His time at Tannadice was equally short-lived, although he did earn another Scottish Cup runners-up medal, as United lost the 2005 Scottish Cup Final to Celtic.\n\nAfter joining Aberdeen at the start of the 2005–06 season, Crawford returned to Dunfermline in August 2006, despite being a regular starter at Pittodrie and among the top league scorers at the time. He signed a two-year deal with his hometown team but failed to be as productive as he had been in his first spell with Dunfermline, scoring only 8 goals in two seasons. He helped Dunfermline reach the 2007 Scottish Cup Final in which he played as a substitute, however for the third time in four seasons Crawford ended up on the losing side in a Scottish Cup final against Celtic. In April 2008, Crawford was told he would not be offered a new contract and was free to find a new club.\n\nOver the course of his career Crawford won 25 caps for Scotland, scoring 4 goals. He made his debut (and scored) in a Kirin Cup tie in 1995, but did not make another appearance until 2001. Crawford played regularly under the management of Berti Vogts.\n\nIt was reported in July 2008 that Crawford had turned down a move to the English Championship in favour of continuing his football in Scotland. Crawford signed a two-year-deal with Scottish Second Division side East Fife a few days later. After David Baikie resigned as manager on 14 April 2009, Crawford became caretaker player/manager, and he was given the job on a permanent basis later that month. After just over a year as manager, Crawford resigned as manager of East Fife, but remained with the club as a registered player.\n\nCrawford was appointed assistant manager of Falkirk in October 2011. He moved to a similar position at Hearts in May 2014, working with Robbie Neilson. Neilson and Crawford both moved to English League One side Milton Keynes Dons in December 2016. They both left MK Dons in January 2018, with the team in 21st place in League One.\n\nCrawford then joined Dunfermline Athletic as a coach. He was appointed head coach in January 2019, after Allan Johnston left the club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Located in South London, the school's main site is in Sutton and its playing fields are in neighbouring Cheam.\n\nThe school has undergone several name changes; it used to be known as \"Sutton County Grammar School\" and later \"Sutton Manor School\" (owing to its proximity with the old Sutton Manor).\n\nThe first Headmaster of the school was Mr E H Hensley, who read Mathematics at Cambridge University and became a wrangler by achieving a first class degree. The first Second Master (or Deputy Headmaster) was Mr L A Valencia, who read Classics at Cambridge University.\n\nThe school was founded on a site between Throwley Way and the High Street in Sutton, and officially opened in a ceremony on 21 July 1899. The main building was opened in 1928 on Manor Lane, directly opposite Manor Park in Sutton.\n\nThe Sutton School Song was composed in 1935 by the Chairman of the Governors, Canon Courtenay Gale, and the words were written by Mr Horn, a classics master, with the school motto, \"Floreat Suttona\" (Latin: \"May Sutton flourish\"), as the refrain. In 1954, however, \"Keep Faith\" was adopted as a new motto, with \"Floreat Suttona\" being used only occasionally, for example, as a sign off in communiqués to old boys of the school (known as \"Old Suttonians\").\n\nSince 1 June 2011, the school has had academy status, and its name formally changed from \"Sutton Grammar School for Boys\" to \"Sutton Grammar School\", although it remains a selective grammar school for boys. From September 2017, however, it began accepting applications from girls to join the Sixth Form.\n\nThe current Headmaster is Mr B Cloves, who joined in 2019. His predecessor, Mr G D Ironside, was headmaster of the school for 29 years. The Deputy Headmistress is Ms Ross, who joined in 2018.\n\nThe school is divided into three sections – the Lower School (Years 7–9), the Upper School (Years 10 and 11) and the Sixth Form (Lower Sixth and Upper Sixth) – each of which attracts its own dress code. Uniform consists of a maroon blazer with a house tie in the Lower School, a black blazer with a house tie in the Upper School and a lounge suit and tie of the pupil's choice in the Sixth Form.\n\nThe school operates a prefect system with a Head Boy, three Deputy Head Boys, Senior Prefects and part-time Prefects from the Sixth Form.\n\nScenes for the Hollywood film Black Sea, starring Jude Law and directed by Kevin Macdonald, were shot outside the school on 1 August 2013. Law appears in the scenes getting in and out of a car whilst pupils walk out of the school in the background.\n\nFictional music character Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer, who performs \"chap hop\" (hip-hop delivered in a Received Pronunciation accent), is described as having attended the school by his creator, Jim Burke, a British parodist.\n\nA prank played by pupils at the school attracted national press coverage, including from The Sun, and generated online debate in 2009. Pupils moved numerous bricks onto the roof of the main building to spell out a rude word in large letters, which was spotted on Google Earth.\n\nThe school is consistently ranked amongst the top schools in the country. It placed 13th out of all secondary schools in England in academic league tables in 2015, putting it in the top 0.05%; placed fifth out of all non-independent secondary schools in England in 2013; and was named in The Times in a list of the \"Best secondary schools in London\" in 2017.\n\nIn 2016, The Independent described the school as part of \"a small group of elite feeder schools\" in South East England that sends a disproportionate number of pupils to Oxbridge and contributes to a north-south bias in Oxbridge admissions. In 2016, for example, over 11% of all university places secured by pupils in the Sixth Form were at Oxbridge, with all Oxbridge applicants having successfully secured their place.\n\nIn 2017, The Times and The Independent featured the school in articles about the top schools in England that \"eclipse Eton in ranking for A-level science\", referring to a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics league table in which the School placed 12th in the country. In the same year, the School was nominated under the category \"Science, technology and engineering teacher or team of the year\" in the Times Educational Supplement Schools Awards 2017.\n\nOne of the school's pupils, Krtin Nithiyanandam, received international press coverage in 2015 after he developed a test for Alzheimer's disease and autism aged 15, for which he was awarded the Scientific American Innovator Award in 2015. He again received widespread press coverage in 2016 after he discovered a way to make deadly triple negative breast cancer more treatable. He conducted this research in the School's laboratories. The Guardian named him alongside Sasha Obama (daughter of Barack and Michelle Obama) and Brooklyn Beckham (son of David and Victoria Beckham) in its \"teen power list\" of 2016, and profiled him as a \"rising star of 2017\".\n\nThe school is selective, requiring pupils to pass an eleven plus examination in order to gain admission. In 2013, The Telegraph ranked it third in a list of the most oversubscribed schools in England, describing it as part of \"an elite group of grammar schools...with more than a thousand applications\". The Daily Mail reported that, in 2012, the school required pupils to pass two entrance examinations, the first involving over 1,600 examinees and the second involving 588 for a total of 120 places. The school sells mock entrance examinations to parents of prospective pupils, which generated an income of £70,000 in 2016.\n\n5 News broadcast a report on the school in 2016, interviewing Headmaster Mr G D Ironside and pupils and covering issues including elitism and life at the School.\n\nThe School admits pupils from ages 11–18, or Years 7–13 (Upper Sixth) in the English academic system. There are approximately 120 pupils in each year in the Lower School (Years 7–9) and Upper School (Years 10 and 11), and slightly fewer in the Sixth Form, varying year-on-year. However, as of September 2015, the school began admitting up to 135 pupils in Year 7.\n\nThe shool's main site is located in Sutton and its playing fields are located in neighbouring Cheam. There has recently been extensive building work carried out to expand the main site.\n\nThe main site consists of the following:\n\nThe Walch Memorial Playing Fields are located off Northey Avenue, Cheam, and typically referred to by pupils and staff at the school as \"Northey\". They are extensive off-site grounds to which pupils are transported a short distance in the school coach or minibuses. They consist of the following:\n\n\nThe School offers the following sports:\nSports take place at the on-site sports hall, main school hall, swimming pool, Walch Memorial Playing Fields in Cheam and Sutton Junior Tennis Centre.\n\nThe most widely played sport at the school is football, followed by cricket. In Years 7–10, sports team are generally split into 'A' and 'B' teams for each year group. Then, there are four further teams covering Year 11 to Upper Sixth (referred to as the 1st XI, 2nd XI, etc.).\n\nThe highlight of the cricket calendar is the 1st XI match against Marylebone Cricket Club.\n\nThe school has a strong tradition of providing ballboys for the Wimbledon tennis championships. Pupils try out at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, before completing months of training to assist on top show courts, including Centre Court.\n\nIn 2016, the rugby 1st XV finished runner-up in the Emerging Schools League and the school won the Borough Cross-country competition.\n\nUntil recently, patball – a hand and ball game said to have been invented at Dulwich College and borrowing from other sports such as Eton Fives – was popular at the school, with several courts in existence on the main site.\n\nThere are various active societies within the school, including:\nChoral, orchestral, musical theatre and drama productions are often held in conjunction with Sutton High School for Girls. Recent productions include The Comedy of Errors, Grease, Loserville, The Wedding Singer, Sweet Charity, Oklahoma!, West Side Story and The Murder in the Red Barn.\n\nIn 2017, the school won the Big Voice Mooting Competition, which was adjudicated by Lord Kerr PC QC and held at the UK Supreme Court. In the same year, the school finished runner-up in The Times/Kingsley Napley Student Advocacy Competition, which was adjudicated by Lady Justice Rafferty and Max Hill QC and held at the headquarters of The Times.\n\nIn 2016, the school finished runner-up in the national finals of the Young Enterprise competition, held at the Emirates Stadium – a competition in which it has often enjoyed success.\n\nIn 2020, a pupil won the Manufacturing Technologies Association's Technology, Design and Innovation Challenge, a leading extracurricular competition for design and technology pupils in the UK, which is judged by a panel of industry figures representing MTA members. The pupil won the Best Overall prize in the 17-19 age category, an individual prize and funding for design and technology equipment for the School.\n\nIn 2019, pupils from the school won the 14–16 and 17–19 age categories of the Manufacturing Technologies Association Technology, Design and Innovation (TDI) Challenge at the European headquarters of Yamazaki Mazak Corporation. The winner of the 17–19 age category had previously won the 14–16 category for the school in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, a pupil was named Young Engineer of the Year by the Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers, a livery company of the City of London, and went on to represent Great Britain at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Los Angeles. Previously, another pupil had also been named Young Engineer of the Year in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, the School won the International Final of the Space Design Competition in the USA, having previously won the UK Final.\n\nThe School runs various domestic and international trips every year. Recent trips have included Washington DC, Normandy, the Rhineland, Spain, European battlefields, the Arctic Circle and numerous ski trips.\n\nThere are various publications produced by pupils of the School and distributed within and outside the School's community, including the geography magazine \"Latitude 51°\", the history magazine \"Retrospect\", the biology magazine \"Life\" and the School magazine \"The Suttonian\".\n\nUpon entry to the school, pupils are allocated to one of five forms, each form being associated with one of the five houses:\n\nIf a pupil has a brother already at the school, he is ordinarily placed in the same house as his brother upon entry. The names of the houses represent the four boundary roads of the existing school site and the road upon which the school was originally founded just a short distance away (Throwley Road). These names were suggested in 2017 by Head of Geography and Old Suttonian Mr R Pletts to replace the previous houses of Blue, Brown, Green and Red, which had been in existence since 1920 and had themselves replaced the original houses of North, South, East and West.\n\nThe House Shield is a competition based on house points, awarded for academic and sporting achievement. As part of the House Shield, the following events are held each year:\nEach year, the House Masters appoint House Captains, Secretaries and occasionally Vice-Captains, who lead pupils in pastoral activities throughout the year. Many address pupils during assemblies, help to organise sports teams, lead the warm-up lap in opening the annual House Athletics Championship and, at the end of their tenure, help to select their successor. They are assisted by a Secretary and occasionally a Vice-Captain.\n\nThe school has one of the most respected training programmes of all cadet forces in the country. It was raised in early 1915 and officially recognised by the War Office in June 1915.\n\nOver the years, boys from the school’s CCF have both served and fought for their country in successive campaigns and wars. In the school's main building, the World War I memorial lists the names of the 80 boys and one master who died during the War. More recently, a World War II memorial was built at the Walch Memorial Playing Fields. It was constructed from 114 stones cemented together in a cairn, each representing a single former pupil who died during the War, and each collected and carried down from over 100 peaks in the United Kingdom. On 15 November 2015, a dedication ceremony was conducted by Old Suttonian Father Jack Noble and attended by staff, former staff, cadets, former cadets, parents and old boys. A guard of honour was held, executed by Year 11 and Upper Sixth cadets under the command of Old Suttonian serving officers, and the names of the dead were read, as well as the Laurence Binyon poem, “For the Fallen\".\n\nThe officer team of the CCF is headed by Wing Commander David Hobbs, an ex-Head Cadet and ex-Head Boy. The CCF is under the leadership of this officer team and an annually appointed Cadet Corporal Major (Army section) and Cadet Warrant Officer (RAF section) from the ranks of the Sixth Form cadets. The head of the RAF section has long been Squadron Leader Giles Peter Benedict Marshall, a teacher at the school.\n\nIn the late 1990s, sponsored by the Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry, the Army section of the CCF began to admit girls from Nonsuch High School for Girls and, in 2007, the RAF section followed suit.\n\nThe CCF celebrated its centenary in 2016 at the Royal Air Force Club, a London gentlemen's club.\n\nAs of 2016, the CCF is the most popular extracurricular activity at the school, with around 300 cadets from Year 9 to Upper Sixth from both the school and Nonsuch High School for Girls.\n\nThe Old Suttonians Cadet Association, which is affiliated to the Old Suttonians Association, enables ex-cadets to stay in contact with each other.\nOld boys of the school are known as \"Old Suttonians\" (often abbreviated to \"Old Sutts\") and entitled to use the post-nominal letters \"OS\". The Old Suttonians Association is the membership group for old boys of the school.\n\nThe Association was founded as the Old Suttonians Football Club in 1906, and soon after as the Old Suttonians Association in 1909. Both were formed by a master of the school, Mr S A Birks. 2006, therefore, saw the one-hundredth anniversary of the Old Suttonians Football Club, whilst the Association itself celebrated its centenary in 2009. The Old Suttonians Cadet Association marked its tenth anniversary in the same year.\n\nThe Association runs an annual reunion dinner in September of each year and, on a more intermittent basis, reunions for the various year groups, most recently for those at the school under the headmastership of Mr E H Hensley or Mr J A Cockshutt. In 2015, a lunch was held at the Royal Air Force Club to mark Mr G D Ironside's 25th anniversary as Headmaster, at which many Old Suttonians were present.\n\nSubscribing Old Suttonians receive a copy of the school's annual publication, \"The Suttonian\".\n\nThere are seven clubs affiliated to the Association:\n\n\nIn its lifetime, the Old Suttonians Association has had a very diverse range of affiliated activities attached to it. A literary and debating society, a cycling and rambling club, chess and bridge clubs, and a very strong swimming club were all in evidence at some point during the period 1909–1970.\n\nThe school has links to Freemasonry, specifically the Athene Lodge, which meets at Sutton Masonic Hall. The Lodge typically publishes a report in the school's annual publication, The Suttonian, with updates on the activities of the Lodge and information for pupils and Old Suttonians considering joining.\n\nThe Lodge was established by a group of Old Suttonians who met in 1931 to consider forming a Masonic lodge to meet in Sutton. On 25 January 1932, a petition bearing 23 signatures was forwarded to the Provincial Grand Master of Surrey, requesting approval from the Grand Master to grant a Warrant of Constitution to form a regular lodge to meet under the name “Athena” in reference to the close association to the school. (References are made to Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, in The Sutton School Song.) On 10 February 1932, news was received that the Provincial Grand Master, H R H The Prince of Wales, had approved the petition and it had been sent to the Grand Secretary of the United Grand Lodge of England. On 2 March 1932, a new Warrant was issued under the slightly amended name of “Athene” and arrangements were put in place for the Consecration ceremony to take place at Mark Masons' Hall, London, on 10 May 1932. Then-Headmaster of the School, Mr J A Cockshut, was invested as Senior Warden of the Lodge.\n\nIn the following years, through loans and donations, Athene Lodge became a Hall Stone Lodge and then a Patron Lodge of the Royal Masonic Hospital in 1939. After World War II, information was received that the contract for the purchase of the Sutton Masonic Hall had been signed and exchanged, and the Lodge contributed 300 guineas to become a shareholder. At a meeting on 17 December 1949, it was reported that a petition had been signed for a Warrant of Constitution for a Royal Arch Chapter to be attached to the Lodge. At the following meeting in February 1950, it was reported that the petition had been approved by the Supreme Grand Chapter and the new Athene Chapter was consecrated on 9 May 1950.\n\nThe lodge of instruction, which was sanctioned by the Lodge at the first meeting after Consecration, met at the school for the first 25 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2161510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161510", "title": "Rock Island State Park (Tennessee)", "text": "Rock Island State Park (Tennessee)\n\nRock Island State Park is a state park in Warren County and White County, Tennessee, located in the Southeastern United States. The park is named after the community of Rock Island, Tennessee, which in turn received its name from an island on the Caney Fork upstream from the Collins River confluence and Great Falls Dam. Rock Island State Park is centered on a peninsula created by the confluence of these two rivers and extends downstream to the headwaters of Center Hill Lake.\n\nThe park consists of and is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.\n\nThe Caney Fork winds its way westward from its source atop the Cumberland Plateau and drops down to the Highland Rim at Scott's Gulf, where it enters White County. Just past Scott's Gulf, the river gains strength, absorbing Cane Creek and the Calfkiller River as it winds along the base of the plateau. At the community of Walling, the river briefly turns southward and absorbs the Rocky River before turning westward again. Two miles beyond its Rocky River confluence, the Caney Fork absorbs the Collins and enters the Great Falls Gorge. Beyond the gorge, the river enters the upper extremes of its Center Hill Lake impoundment and begins winding its way northward toward its mouth along the Cumberland River, near Carthage.\n\nThe Collins River rises atop the Cumberland Plateau several miles south of Rock Island State Park at the head of a canyon known as Savage Gulf. The river winds its way northward through a section of the Highland Rim known as \"the Barrens,\" and steadies as it enters the eastern section of McMinnville. The river almost joins the Caney Fork at a point just opposite the Great Falls Dam power plant, but instead bends southward to create the peninsula where the present park is located.\n\nRock Island, the park's namesake, is an island located in the Caney Fork at , approximately upstream from the present site of Great Falls Dam. The community of Rock Island is located along Great Falls Lake east of the state park.\n\n\n\nThe history of the Caney Fork from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the 1920s tells the story of entrepreneur after entrepreneur attempting to harness the Caney Fork's alluring power potential only to be defeated by the river's volatile flash-flood tendencies. In his \"Ode to the Caney Fork,\" local poet R.P. Hudson summed up this period:\nPlayful river, ever laughing,<br>\nPleading river, always calling,<br>\nRushing river, now unwieldy,<br>\nWild, deep river, oft defiant.\n\nThe Bosson Mill, built around the time of the Civil War, was one of the first major mills to use the waterpower of the Great Falls Gorge. Water from the falls was used to power a grist mill on the mill's first floor and a carding factory on the second floor. Water was then diverted via flume to a sawmill downstream. The Bosson Mill, which was moderately profitable, was destroyed when the Caney Fork flooded in 1882.\n\nIn 1881, the completion of a railroad brought larger industries to the area. In the mid-1880s, entrepreneur Asa Faulkner purchased the Bosson Mill property with plans to build a large cotton mill. Faulkner and several partners raised $30,000 dollars in capital and chartered the Falls City Cotton Mill Company in 1892. The company built a wheelhouse to harness the power from Great Falls and divert it to the cotton mill, higher up on the bluffs. The company also developed a small town for the mill's workers which became known as \"Falls City.\" Along with the spring castle that still stands, the town had its own post office and general store. In 1902, however, the company met the same fate as the Bosson Mill when the Caney Fork flooded again. The mill was high enough to escape harm, but its wheelhouse was completely wiped out. The flood also destroyed the company's tollbridge, which spanned the river just upstream. The company abandoned the mill shortly thereafter and the town died out.\n\nIn 1904, the Great Falls Power Company purchased the Great Falls property with plans to dam the Caney Fork and provide power to the Nashville area. The company built several coffer dams, all of which were destroyed when the river flooded in 1914. The company, which often struggled with finances, finally began construction on the Great Falls Hydroelectric Plant in 1915, and the dam went into operation in 1917. The Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCo) purchased the Great Falls Power Company in 1922, and tripled the dam's operating capacity. The Good Friday Flood of 1929, in which the Caney Fork reached record volumes, destroyed the dam's substation and flooded its powerhouse, but the dam held. In 1939, the TEPCO Dam was purchased by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which continues to operate it.\n\nThe creation of a lake by the Great Falls Dam brought numerous recreational opportunities to Rock Island. The Webb Hotel arrived in the area in 1920, and several rustic cabins were built later in the decade. By the 1930s, Rock Island had grown into a small fishing resort.\nRock Island State Park was established in 1969.\n\nThe Rock Island area was used for a considerable number of exterior shots and stunts in the 1994 Sylvester Stallone film, \"The Specialist\".\n\nRock Island State Park currently maintains 10 cabins, 60 campsites, and a boat ramp. The park's Center Hill Lake section contains a natural sand beach and a popular fishing area known as the \"Blue Hole.\" Hiking trails include two trails that access the north and south banks of the Great Falls Gorge, and a trail that runs along the Collins River. Deer, woodpeckers, and wildflowers are commons sites along the park's trails.\n\nIn recent years, Rock Island State Park has become popular with kayakers, who use the river for playboating. Below Great Falls Dam is a series of rapids with a well-known, constant, retentive \"hole\" that allows playboaters to hone their whitewater kayaking skills, riding the wave, spinning, rolling and performing other tricks.\n\nRock Island State Park also maintains the Big Bone Cave State Natural Area, which is located a few miles to the east in Van Buren County.\n\n"}

Jon Lovitz plays Emperor Tod Spengo, who is the cruel, silly and over-dramatic emperor of the planet named Spengo. Teri Garr plays Marge Nelson and Jeffrey Jones plays Dick Nelson, her husband. The film also stars Eric Idle and Thalmus Rasulala. Rasulala died shortly after completing his scenes, and the film is dedicated to his memory.\n\nEmperor Tod Spengo (Jon Lovitz), with General Afir (Thalmus Rasulala) at his side, takes over a small planet at the edge of the galaxy populated entirely by idiots, and renames it after himself. He has all the resources of the planet engaged to create his \"Super Death Ray Laser\" to destroy Earth, thus making Spengo the greatest planet in the Universe. When Spengo peeks at the laser's planned point of impact (a Southern California suburb), he beholds housewife Marge Nelson (Teri Garr) and instantly falls in love. Using his Magnobeam (a giant magnet), he kidnaps Marge and her husband Dick (Jeffrey Jones) on their way to their 20th-anniversary weekend, hoping to make Marge his wife.\n\nDick and Marge get separated on Spengo: Marge is sent to the lap of luxury, waited on by servants with fish or dog heads, while Dick is thrown into a dungeon. In his cell, Dick meets the rightful king of Spengo, Raff (Eric Idle), who gives him plans for his son, called the White Bird, leader of a band of rebels out in the desert. In the meantime, Spengo finds that his advances towards Marge are failing, so he tries to read Dick's mind in order to discover the secret to her heart before having him executed. Upon witnessing Dick's devotion to Marge, Spengo's interrogator, Sibor (Wallace Shawn), has a change of heart and helps Dick escape. Despite the stupidity of his captors, Dick is soon discovered and forced down a garbage chute to the sewers, where he encounters a pack of carnivorous mushroom-like creatures called Lub-Lubs and is forced to run for his life.\n\nDick manages to escape the sewers and steal an escape pod, and winds up crashing in the desert, where he meets the rebels led by King Raff's son, Sirk (Dwier Brown), and daughter, Semage (Kathy Ireland), all of them dressed as 6-foot-tall birds, although such creatures are not naturally found on Spengo. At first, the rebels don't trust Dick; but when Dick reveals that he shared a cell with Raff and that he is on their side, their attitude quickly changes, and Dick rises to the rank of war leader. Using what little resources he can scrounge up, he devises a plan to sneak back into Spengo's palace and save Marge. In the meantime, General Afir, the only intelligent person among Spengo's forces and resentful of his emperor's antics, believes that Dick and Marge are the key to ending Spengo's rule, so he switches the love serum meant for Marge with water and informs her of his intentions to recover Dick. However, Spengo overhears Afir's plan and has him placed in the barrel of the laser, to die when the weapon is fired at Earth.\n\nWhile Spengo's wedding with Marge is prepared, a detachment of Spengo's soldiers go into the desert to finish the rebels, but find their camp deserted, and one by one they fall victim to a Light Grenade (which disintegrates anyone touching it) left on Dick's pallet. Simultaneously, Dick and the rebels approach Spengo's fortress inside a large wooden bust of Spengo, which Spengo has brought into the chapel, and in the midst of the wedding ceremony the rebels emerge from the Trojan bust. As fighting rages in the castle, Spengo retreats to his lab with Marge and prepares to fire the laser at Earth. Dick and Tod clash with swords, but neither gains the upper hand. Marge manages to free herself and help Dick throwing Spengo into the sewers, where he is devoured by the Lub-Lubs. At the last second, Dick and Marge manage to shut down the laser, saving Afir and the Earth.\n\nWith Tod deceased, Raff is reinstated as the rightful king, and he reverses the polarity on the Magnobeam to send Dick and Marge back to Earth. Upon arriving home, Dick and Marge proceed to show their son (Danny Cooksey), daughter (Suzanne Ventulett), and her boyfriend Carl (Michael Stoyanov) slides (including an image of their space journey to Planet Spengo) from what they claim is \"Santa Barbara\". To end their anniversary, they share drinks on the roof, watching the stars.\n\n\nThe film received negative critical reviews and was a box office bomb. It opened in 904 theatres and grossed only $984,627 in its opening weekend. The following weekend it dropped nearly 70% and was withdrawn from distribution after a gross of $2 million.\n\n"}

Until the Industrial Revolution, the use of traditional number systems was common among shepherds, especially in the fells of the Lake District. The \"Yan Tan Tethera\" system was also used for counting stitches in knitting. The words derive from a Brythonic Celtic language. Though most of these number systems fell out of use by 1910, some are still in use. \n\nThe word \"yan\" or \"yen\" for \"one\" in some northern English dialects generally represents a regular development in Northern English in which the Old English long vowel <ā> was broken into /ie/, /ia/ and so on. This explains the shift to \"yan\" and \"ane\" from the Old English \"ān\", which is itself derived from the Proto-Germanic \"*ainaz\". Another example of this development is the Northern English word for \"home\", \"hame\", which has forms such as \"hyem, yem\" and \"yam\" all deriving from the Old English \"hām\".\n\nIn order to keep accurate records (e.g. of birth and death) and to be alert to instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. Dating back at least to the medieval period, and continuing to the present in some areas like Slaidburn, farms were granted fell rights, allowing them access to common grazing land. To prevent overgrazing, it was vitally important for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.\n\nThough fell rights are largely obsolete in modern agriculture except in upland areas, farms are often subsidised and taxed according to the quantity of their sheep. For this reason, accurate counts are still necessary, and must be performed frequently.\n\nGenerally, a count is the first action performed in the morning and the last action performed at night. A count is made after moving the sheep from one pasture to another, and after any operation involving the sheep, such as shearing, tagging, foot-trimming, mulesing, etc., although sheep are far less likely to stray while being moved in a group than when grazing at large on open ground.\n\nSheep-counting systems ultimately derive from Brythonic Celtic languages, such as Cumbric; Tim Gay writes: “[Sheep-counting systems from all over the British Isles] all compared very closely to 18th-century Cornish and modern Welsh\". It is impossible, given the corrupted form in which they have survived, to be sure of their exact origin. The counting systems have changed considerably over time. A particularly common tendency is for certain pairs of adjacent numbers to come to resemble each other by rhyme (notably the words for 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9). Still, multiples of five tend to be fairly conservative; compare \"bumfit\" with Welsh \"pymtheg\", in contrast with standard English \"fifteen\".\n\nLike most Celtic numbering systems, they tend to be vigesimal (based on the number twenty), but they usually lack words to describe quantities larger than twenty; though this is not a limitation of either modernised decimal Celtic counting systems or the older ones. To count a large number of sheep, a shepherd would repeatedly count to twenty, placing a mark on the ground, or move his hand to another mark on his crook, or drop a pebble into his pocket to represent each score (e.g. 5 score sheep = 100 sheep).\n\nTheir use is also attested in a knitting song from Yorkshire. Similar modern references have since been made in both products produced and sold within Northern England, such as prints, beers, and yarns, as well as artistic works simply referencing the region, such as Sir Harrison Birtwistle's 1986 opera \"Yan Tan Tethera\".\n\n\n"}

He is the nephew of film magnate Sir Alexander Korda and brother Zoltan Korda, both film directors. Korda grew up in England but received part of his education in France where his father had worked with film director Marcel Pagnol. As a child, Korda also lived in the United States from 1941 to 1946. He was schooled at the private Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland and read History at Magdalen College, Oxford. He served in the Royal Air Force doing intelligence work in Germany.\n\nThe novelist Graham Greene was a lifelong friend. Korda met him on his Uncle Alex Korda's yacht.\n\nKorda moved to New York City in 1957 where he worked for playwright Sidney Kingsley as a research assistant and then later as a freelance reader in the CBS story department. In 1958 he joined the book publishing firm, Simon & Schuster, beginning as an assistant editor, which included the task of reading slush pile manuscripts for Henry Simon.\n\nMany editors stick to one area of interest, but early on Korda demonstrated an ability and interest in editing both fiction and non-fiction. He states in his memoir that he edited books on everything from mathematics and philosophy, memoirs, fiction, translations from French, politics, anthropology and science history among others. One of the first books Korda bought was \"The Forest People\" by Colin Turnbull—a memoir of Turnbull's time living with the Mbuti Pygmies in the then Belgian Congo.\n\nAfter Robert Gottlieb left Simon & Schuster for Alfred A. Knopf, Korda became Editor-in-Chief of Simon & Schuster. Korda was a major figure in the book industry, publishing numerous works by high-profile writers and personalities such as William L. Shirer, Will and Ariel Durant, Harold Robbins, Irving Wallace, Richard Nixon, Richard Rhodes and Ronald Reagan. Korda was a major part of Simon & Schuster for more than forty years. In the autumn of 1994, he was diagnosed as having prostate cancer. In 1997 he wrote \"Man to Man\", which recounted his medical experience. In 2000, he published \"\", about the world of publishing.\n\nIn addition to being an editor, Korda was also a writer. In the mid-sixties Korda began to write freelance articles for \"Glamour\" magazine and eventually wrote their film review column for almost ten years. Korda also wrote for Clay Felker's \"New York\" magazine including a piece that eventually became his first book, \"Male Chauvinism and How it Works at Home and in the Office\". Korda's second book, \"Power!\", reached the number one spot on \"The New York Times\" Bestseller list in 1975. Korda the writer was represented by agent Lynn Nesbit.\n\nAmong Korda's other books are \"Charmed Lives\", which the story of his father and his two uncles, and the novel \"Queenie\", which is a roman à clef about his aunt, actress Merle Oberon, which was later adapted into a television miniseries. Korda said he felt that \"Charmed Lives\" was the book he was born to write, \"as if I had been observing and storing up memories with just that purpose in mind for years.\"\n\nBeginning in the 2000s, Korda wrote a number of history and biography books on the Hungarian Revolution, Dwight Eisenhower, T.E. Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. On writing histories Korda said, \"I've always wanted to write history, and it was only the accident of going to work for a book publisher in 1958 (and the need to earn a regular paycheck) that slowed me down\".\n\nMichael Korda is Editor-in-Chief Emeritus for Simon & Schuster.\n\nMichael Korda married first wife Carolyn \"Casey\" Keese in 1958; they had one child, Chris. Chris became the leader of the Church of Euthanasia.\n\nKorda later married Margaret Mogford, a former fashion model and the former wife of photographer Burt Glinn. The two shared a love of horses and met at the Claremont Riding Academy near Central Park while they were both still married to their first spouses. They co-authored a number of books together including \"Horse Housekeeping\".\n\nKorda has written about his personal life and his hobbies. An avid horseman and fox hunter, he authored \"Horse People\" and \"Horse Housekeeping\".

Sigvatr was the best known of the court skalds of King Olaf and also served as his marshal (\"stallare\").\n\nApproximately 160 verses of Sigvatr's poetry have been preserved, more than any for other poet from this period. The style of Sigvat's poems is simpler and clearer than that which generally characterises older compositions. Although his verse is still dense, he uses fewer complex poetic circumlocutions than many of his predecessors, and as a Christian poet, he by and large avoids allusions to pagan mythology.\n\nMost of his surviving poems were texts that praised King Olaf. Many of the poems from St. Olaf's saga in \"Heimskringla\" are by Sigvatr. \"Víkingarvísur\", composed \"c\". 1014-15, is the oldest of the surviving long poems attributed to him. The poem tallies King Olaf’s battles on his Viking expeditions until 1015, when he returned to Norway to carve out a kingdom for himself.\n\nIn \"Nesjavísur\", the next oldest poem by Sigvatr, the skald describes the naval battle between Olaf and Sveinn Hákonarson at the Battle of Nesjar outside Brunlanes in 1016, the key moment in Olaf's ascent to power in Norway. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2161552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161552", "title": "Edgar Evins State Park", "text": "Edgar Evins State Park\n\nEdgar Evins State Park is a state park in DeKalb County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The park consists of along the shores of Center Hill Lake, an impoundment of the Caney Fork. The State of Tennessee leases the land from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nJames Edgar Evins (1883–1954), the park's namesake, was a Smithville businessman and state senator who played a vital role in the development of the Center Hill Dam and Reservoir in the 1940s. He was the father of former United States Representative Joe L. Evins, for whom the nearby Joe L. Evins Appalachian Center for Craft is named. The Evins family began pushing for the establishment of a state park along the DeKalb portion of Center Hill Lake as early as the 1950s.\n\nThe Caney Fork flows down from its source atop the Cumberland Plateau and winds its way northwestward across the Eastern Highland Rim before emptying into the Cumberland River near Carthage, Tennessee. Center Hill Dam, located approximately above the mouth of the Caney Fork, has created a reservoir that spans a stretch of the river between the dam and the Great Falls Dam at Rock Island State Park in adjacent Warren County. Edgar Evins State Park covers the northeast shore of the reservoir immediately upstream from Center Hill Dam.\n\nThe park is situated amidst rolling hills (\"knobs\") that comprise part of the geological boundary between the Eastern Highland Rim and the Central Basin. These hills are typically underlain by Mississippian period limestone, the erosion of which has created karst-like formations throughout the Center Hill Basin. Outcroppings of this limestone are visible along the cliffs overlooking the lake.\n\nMost of Edgar Evins State Park is coated in a second-growth hardwood forest typical of the Eastern Highland Rim. Common tree species include the tuliptree, white basswood, sugar maple, white ash, and various species of oak and hickory.\n\nA pre-inundation archaeological survey of the Center Hill Basin conducted by the Smithsonian Institution located several possible prehistoric village and mound sites, including a platform mound at the mouth of Mine Lick Creek, just upstream from the modern park boundary. Early settlers in the area also claimed to have found Native American graves and other objects. More extensive excavations, however, failed to uncover any major prehistoric sites.\n\nThe earliest Euro-American settlers in the DeKalb area arrived in the late 1790s and established the town of Liberty just west of the modern park. Over the years, several families settled in the hollows and valleys of what is now Edgar Evins State Park and adjacent lands that would eventually be inundated by Center Hill Lake. One such settler, Alexander Dunham (1826–1878), whose family arrived in the area in the 1830s, is buried on a hill within the park that overlooks Center Hill Lake. Dunham's son lived near the present site of Center Hill Dam.\n\nThe Caney Fork has long been notorious for its volatility. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, business venture after business venture tried to harness the river's power, only to be defeated by one of several catastrophic floods that occurred along the river during this period. Major floods in 1902, 1915, 1928, and 1929 wiped out mills, bridges, houses, and farms, and led to increased calls for flood control. In the 1930s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated several flood control projects in the Cumberland River watershed, including Center Hill Dam, the construction of which was authorized in 1938. Flood control and power production were the primary goals of the Center Hill Dam project.\n\nCenter Hill Lake's revised management plan in the 1940s called for the inclusion of recreational areas along the lake's shores. These included several small local parks and boatramps at first. In the late 1960s, the State of Tennessee began construction of facilities for Edgar Evins State Park. The park was officially dedicated in 1975.\n\nEdgar Evins State Park maintains a 300-slip marina and full service dock. Various types of watercraft may be rented at the marina. Lodging areas include a 34-cabin lodging complex and a campground with both modern and primitive campsites.\n\nHiking trails maintained by the park include the Highland Rim Trail, which loops down, around, and back up through a hillside forest characteristic of the Eastern Highland Rim, and the Dunham Cemetery Trail, a short trail that ascends to a small cemetery where former resident Alexander Dunham and two of his children are buried (as of 2008, the trail was slated for expansion). The Millennium Trail consists of a loop that descends to the shores of Center Hill Lake and passes several pre-1940s homesteads (most of the ruins consist of rockwall-fences) before looping back into the forest. The Merritt Ridge Trail, a extension of the Millennium Trail, traverses Merritt Ridge, a steep ridge that became a peninsula with the reservoir's creation.\n\nThe Friends of Edgar Evins State Park was organized in 2003 to support park preservation efforts. The group conducts several annual tours of the park's flora, lake, and waterfalls.\n"}

It starts in a tunnel of the Paris Périphérique at Porte Dauphine, with an on-board view from an unseen car exiting up on a slip road to Avenue Foch. Well-known landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe, Opéra Garnier, and Place de la Concorde with its obelisk are passed, as well as the Champs-Élysées. Pedestrians are passed, pigeons sitting on the streets are scattered, red lights are ignored, one-way streets are driven up the wrong way, centre lines are crossed, and the car drives on the sidewalk to avoid a rubbish lorry. The car is never seen as the camera seems to be attached below the front bumper (judging from the relative positions of other cars, the visible headlight beam and the final shot when the car is parked in front of a kerb on Montmartre, with the famous Sacré-Cœur Basilica behind, and out of shot). Here, the driver gets out and embraces a young blonde woman as bells ring in the background, with the famous backdrop of Paris.\n\nShot in a single take, it is an example of cinéma-vérité. The length of the film was limited by the short capacity of the 1000 foot 35mm film reel, and filmed from a (supposedly) gyro-stabilised camera mounted on the bumper of a Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9. A photo has surfaced that seems to reveal an Eclair cam-flex 35mm camera with a wide angle lens, and a typical \"speed rail\" hard mount—no gyros—on a Mercedes. This model, which could reach a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph), was only available with a three-speed automatic transmission. Lelouch drove his own car himself and claimed that the top speed achieved was around 200 km/h in the 1.3 km avenue Foch. Lelouch also claimed during a \"making of\" documentary that the soundtrack was dubbed with the sound of Lelouch's Ferrari 275GTB, which has a corresponding number of gears and a V-12 sound that is quite distinct from that of any V8, including the 6.9 litre V8 of the alleged Mercedes camera car.\n\nOn the chosen course there were two people who knew to expect Lelouch. First there was Élie Chouraqui, his first assistant, who was posted with a walkie-talkie in the Rue de Rivoli, behind the archway exiting from the gardens of the Louvre palace, meaning to assist the driver at the only blind junction (archway); however, Lelouch has revealed that the radios failed, and if Chouraqui had tried to warn him of a pedestrian the message would not have been received. Anyway, the traffic light at that junction showed green. \nThe other person who knew about his arrival was Lelouch's girlfriend Gunilla Friden. He'd told her he'd arrive within ten minutes at the Sacré-Cœur and asked her to appear upon his arrival.\n\nIn 2003, documentary filmmaker Richard Symons contacted Claude Lelouch and after six months of arduous talks, persuaded him the film should be restored from its original 35 mm negative and re-released on DVD. Symons' company Spirit Level Film now distributes the DVD worldwide.\n\nThe route was as follows:\nBd Périphérique (exits at Porte Dauphine) · Av Foch · Pl Charles-de-Gaulle · Av des Champs-Elysées · Pl de la Concorde · Quai des Tuileries · Pl du Carrousel · R de Rohan · Av de l'Opera · Pl de l'Opéra · Fromental Halévy · R de la Chausée d'Antin · Pl d'Estienne d'Orves · R Blanche · R Pigalle · Pl Pigalle · Bd de Clichy · (aborted turn at R Lepic) · R Caulaincourt · Av Junot · Pl Marcel Aymé · R Norvins · Pl du Tertre · R Ste-Eleuthère · R Azais · Pl du Parvis du Sacré Cœur.\n\nThe route measures 10.597 km long, which indicates an average speed of approximately 80 km/h (50 mph).\nComments attributed to Lelouch indicate that he acknowledges the public's \"moral outrage\" over his method of shooting this film. He also states that he was prepared to take the risks in making the film, but that he was also ready to drop it if he came across any unexpected risk (pedestrian, obstacle, etc.).\n\nIn 2003, Nissan released a promotional DVD for the new (at the time) 350Z, entitled \"The Run\". It featured multiple camera views of a copper coloured 350Z driving through the streets of Prague, ending with a rendezvous with a beautiful woman, an obvious homage to Lelouch.\n\nIn 2007, the film was used as the music video for Snow Patrol's song \"Open Your Eyes\".\n\nIn late 2009, a short film called \"The Fast and the Famous\", directed by Jeremy Hart, was released on YouTube. The film features Jay Leno behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG. During his circuit of Mulholland Drive, Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Beverly Drive, and Coldwater Canyon Drive, Leno makes several references to Lelouch's classic film.\nIn 2010, Jeremy Clarkson used the film as a basis for the opening scene of his DVD/Blu-ray \"The Italian Job\".\n\nIn 2013, Phoenix used the film as a backdrop for live shows during the song \"Love Like a Sunset Part I\".\n\nOn 17 February 2017, Ford Motor Company in association with Claude Lelouch released a 360 degree view remake of the film using a Ford Mustang. Unlike the original, the 2017 version contains several cut scenes and does not show the entire (original) route of Lelouch's 1976 version.\n\nIn 2017, the British motoring show \"The Grand Tour\" produced an homage to \"Rendezvous\", featuring a Bugatti Chiron driving across Turin in the episode \"Bah Humbug-atti\".\n\nThe 2018 video game Forza Horizon 4 features a story mission in which the player drives an Alpine A110 around the streets of Edinburgh for a short film in an homage to C'était un rendez-vous.\nIn 2020 Lelouch filmed his own 'remake' of the film entitled \"Le Grand Rendez-vous\", this time set in Monaco instead of Paris and starring Monegasque racing driver Charles Leclerc. Filming for the new version took place on the closed Circuit de Monaco on 24 May 2020 and features Leclerc driving a Ferrari SF90 Stradale. The film is set to premiere on 13 June 2020.\n"}

It is dedicated to the Egyptian god Montu. The area covers about 20,000 m². Most monuments are poorly preserved.\n\nThe main features of the Precinct of Montu are the Temple of Montu, Temple of Harpre, Temple of Ma'at, a sacred lake and the Gateway of Ptolemy III Euergetes / Ptolemy IV Philopator, which is the most visible structure on the site and can be easily seen from inside the Precinct of Amon-Re. This gateway is also called \"Bab el’Adb\". This large monumental door was reached via a dromos leading from a quay that led to a channel which connected the field to that of Montu of Medamud further north of the city. Through this gate, is reached a large court which was decorated by a colonnade dating from the 25th dynasty Kushite period. In the south, a series of doors opened onto a series of vaults of Divine Adoratrices, which were next to the northern part of the precinct of Amun-Re.\n\nThe enclosure was built of mud-brick and restored by Nectanebo in the 30th dynasty\n\nThis temple consisted of the traditional parts of an Egyptian temple with a pylon, court and rooms filled with columns. The ruins of the temple date to the reign of Amenhotep III who rebuilt the sanctuary dating from the Middle Kingdom era and dedicated it to Montu-Re. Ramesses II increased the size of the temple by adding a forecourt and erecting two obelisks there. A large court with gantry gave on hypostyle open on the court, characteristic of the buildings of the reign of Amenhotep I. The sanctuary is made up as follows: a room with four columns serving various vaults of the worship and giving on the room of the boat which preceded the naos by the god. Nearby in Medamud was another Temple of Montu.\n\nThe Temple of Maât is famous for its court which judged the plunderers of royal tombs under Ramesses IX at the end of the 20th dynasty.\n\nThe Temple of Harpre was for the most part built under Hakor of the 29th dynasty.\n"}

Nicknamed \"Dr. Death\" by the press for his alleged actions in apartheid South Africa, Basson was acquitted in 2002 of 67 charges, after having been suspended from his military post with full pay in 1999.\n\nAmong other charges, Basson was alleged to have supplied a \"lethal triple cocktail of powerful muscle relaxants which were used during Operation Duel (the systematic elimination of SWAPO prisoners of war and South African Defence Force [SADF] members who posed a threat to South African covert operations). The United Nations report identifies the triple cocktail as ketamine, succinylcholine, and tubocurarine.\n\nMuch of what Basson was working on is still secret. It is known that in 1981, when he was working as a personal physician to state president P. W. Botha, the country's Surgeon-General hired Basson to work for and form 7 Medical Battalion Group, a specialist unit of the South African Military Health Service. His job was to collect information about other countries' chemical and biological warfare capabilities under the name Project Coast. After his preliminary report, Basson became the head project officer and began to work on the country's chemical and biological weapons capability. He recruited about 200 researchers from around the world and received annual funds equivalent to $10 million. In 1982, Basson is alleged to have arranged the killing of 200 SWAPO prisoners in \"Operation Duel\".\n\nProject Coast secretly researched chemical and biological warfare in violation of the international BTWC agreement. Basson created four front companies; Delta G Scientific Company; Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), Protechnik and Infadel, which in 1989 was split into two companies – D. John Truter Financial Consultants and Sefmed Information Services. The companies were used to officially distance the military from the project, to procure necessary chemicals and channel funds for the research. According to later investigation, Basson had a free rein to do what he wanted. Delta G did most of the research, production and development of the chemical agents, while RRL developed chemical and biological pathogens and allegedly was involved with genetic engineering. Protechnik was a large nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plant developing defences against chemical weapons. Infadel dealt with those on a smaller scale and concentrated on financing and administration of other units and possibly channelling funds between military and research facilities. Many of the employees were not aware of what they were involved with.\n\nIn the 1980s Basson and the project were allegedly involved with attacks and assassinations against members of anti-apartheid movements. Leaders in South Africa, Angola and Namibia also claimed that the more dangerous chemicals were used for crowd control in the country, although the government claimed otherwise and claimed that chemical weapons were used against South African troops. Basson provided the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) with lethal chemicals to be used against prominent anti-apartheid activists. Basson continued to travel all over the world to gather information about chemical and biological warfare programs and set up other shell and paper companies as additional front companies, possibly for money laundering.\n\nWhen F. W. de Klerk became president in 1990, he ordered that production of the chemicals be stopped and the lethal agents destroyed. Basson concentrated on non-lethal chemical agents and chemicals the government had not banned. That included a large amount of ecstasy and Mandrax that were apparently exported or allegedly sold to drug dealers in communities active in the anti-apartheid movement (cf. Basson brownies). Most of the stockpile disappeared afterwards. Scientists working on the project later stated that they believed it was to be used to create drug-laced tear gas. In January 1992, FRELIMO troops conducted an operation near the South African border. During the course of the operation, they were allegedly exposed to what was thought to have been a chemical agent. Some of the soldiers died during the incident and others required hospitalisation. Investigation by the United Nations, United States and the United Kingdom identified it as BZ nerve agent. US and Britain began to pressure the South African government and in January 1993 Project Coast was wound down. Basson was officially retired and hired to dismantle the project, and allegedly profited when some of the South African front companies were privatised. Later government investigation found that there were large amounts of chemicals and agents missing.\n\nIn 1993 the Office of Serious Economic Offences (OSEO) began to investigate Basson's business dealings in an unheard of seven year forensic audit. In 1995 the South African government hired Basson to work for Transnet, a transportation and infrastructure company and possibly for other more secretive jobs. The US and UK governments suspected that during his visits to Libya between 1993-1995, Basson might have sold chemical and biological weapons secrets. In 1995, the government of Nelson Mandela rehired Basson as an army surgeon, allegedly due to US and UK pressure and possibly because the government wanted to keep an eye on him.\n\nIn 1996, South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) began to investigate the SADF and determined that the army had probably used lethal toxins against ANC activists. Basson was connected to many of these attacks. In 1997, the CIA told the South African government that Basson intended to leave the country. When Basson was arrested in a sting operation in Pretoria in 1997, he had 1000 ecstasy tablets with him. At the time, he had hundreds of secret Project Coast documents in his car. TRC began to investigate Project Coast which led them to suspect that Basson had sold his secrets to governments of countries like Libya and Iraq. In 1997 they asked the help of the Netherlands Institute for Southern Africa (NIZA) whose investigation report was included in the Truth Commission Files.\n\nAt the same time, the Office for Serious Economic Offences, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the Gauteng Attorney-General's Special Investigation Team investigated Basson's affairs. Conflict of interest slowed down the Commission investigation but the TRC gained more information from OSEO. Basson appeared before the TRC on 31 July 1998 and gave evidence for 12 hours. While his lawyers constantly interrupted the questioning with legal technicalities, the Commission determined that Basson had been the primary decision maker in Project Coast and should be put on trial.\n\nBasson’s trial began on 4 October 1999 in Pretoria. At the time, the South African media had dubbed him \"Dr Death\". Basson faced 67 charges, including drug possession, drug trafficking, fraud and embezzlement of a total of R36,000,000, 229 murders and conspiracy to murder and theft. Basson refused to seek amnesty from the Truth Commission. The prosecution presented 153 witnesses, but the case soon began to turn against them. On 11 October 1999 Judge Willie Hartzenberg dismissed six important charges, including four charges of murder and possible involvement in 200 deaths in Namibia, because he stated that the South African court could not prosecute crimes committed in other countries. Basson was also included in the Namibian amnesty of 1989. Hartzenberg then adjourned the trial for two weeks. After 18 months of trial, he reduced the number of charges to 46.\n\nBasson called only one witness – himself. In July 2001 Basson began to present his own evidence, speaking for 40 days. He stated that he had learned about weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein, that he had indeed had free rein in the project and that he had exchanged information with foreign governments. Technically, all that was legal. The defence argued that Basson should have immunity for anything that had happened in Namibia. On 22 April 2002 Judge Hartzenberg dismissed all the remaining charges against Basson and granted him amnesty. In his judgement, the judge called the state's case \"fragmented and confusing\", and that it was largely superficial, hoping to convince the court of Basson's guilt in a manner which fell far short of the standard \"beyond reasonable doubt\". Judge Hartzenberg further added that the state seemed to have decided what the truth was and had urged the court not to believe anything that contradicted the state's version of the truth. The trial had lasted 30 months. The state tried to appeal the judgement due to legal inaccuracies, but the Supreme Court of Appeal refused to order a retrial in 2003, a step reserved for appeals that had no chance of success.\n\nAfter his release, Basson continued to travel all over the world as a guest speaker, and has founded his own private medical practice. In June 2005, a group of Swiss investigators questioned him about illegal trade in weapons and nuclear material and asked the South African government to stop cooperating with him.\n\nLater that year the Constitutional Court, South Africa's highest court, overturned the judgement of the Supreme Court of Appeal. It ruled that crimes allegedly committed outside the country could be prosecuted in South Africa. Since then, the National Prosecuting Authority has not instituted proceedings against Basson for crimes against humanity.\n\nIn 2006, the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) started its own process of investigating Basson’s conduct. A charge sheet was drawn up and the inquiry began in November 2007. Out of the seven charges levelled against Basson, four full indictments remain after the HPCSA discharged two charges and part of a third charge against him.\n\nOn 10 May 2010, the application by Wouter Basson to the South African High Court was rejected. The application to the High Court attempted to have the charges set aside as unlawful, unreasonable and unfair. The judge found that there was no evidence to suggest that the Council was in any way biased or prejudiced against the doctor.\n\nOn 18 December 2013, the HPCSA found Basson guilty of unprofessional conduct on four charges. On 4 June 2014 sentencing procedure was postponed due to unavailability of counsel.\n\nOn 27 March 2019, six years after Basson was found guilty of unethical conduct by an HPCSA committee, the Gauteng High Court ruled that there was bias on the part of the committee members that presided over the disciplinary hearing. The judge ruled that the proceedings (instituted by the HPCSA against Basson) were irregular and unfair and illustrated a total disregard for the rights of Basson. The hearing (and, therefore, the finding of unethical conduct by the committee) was accordingly set aside.\n\n"}

It was also the first medical school to institute a residency training program. UMB SOM's campus includes Davidge Hall, which was built in 1812, and is the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to an degree, the UMB SOM offers PhD programs through the Graduate Program in Life Sciences. It also offers several joint degree programs: a Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) MD/PhD, a joint MD/DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery), the MD/MPH (Master of Public Health) program, and the PhD/DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy).\n\nThe University of Maryland School of Medicine was ranked 12th in \"U.S. News and World Report\"s 2021 rankings of \"Best Medical Schools: Primary Care\", and 34th in \"Best Medical Schools: Research\". , the school offered admission to 6.3% of applicants. Since 2006, the medical school dean has been E. Albert Reece.\n\nChartered as the College of Medicine of Maryland in December 1807, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was the founding school of the University System of Maryland and the only public medical school in the U.S. at the time. It is the fifth oldest medical school in the country after the medicals schools at Columbia University (established May 1807), Dartmouth College (1798), Harvard University (1782), and the University of Pennsylvania (1765).\n\nIts founding by Nathaniel Potter and John Beale Davidge was part of an influx of professionals to Baltimore and the rapid urban development that immediately followed the American Revolution. By the late 1780s, there was public discussion about the need for \"medical reform and suppression of quackery\". A group of physicians made several short-lived attempts at starting medical schools around the turn of the 19th century, and were finally successful in 1807 when the Maryland state legislature passed the Medical College Bill, authorizing the formation the College of Medicine of Maryland. In 1812 it was rechartered as the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nDavidge Hall, built in 1812 and still in use today, is the original building of the College of Medicine of Maryland. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the United States. In the 1950s, the building was named after John Beale Davidge, one of the founders and the first dean of the College of Medicine of Maryland.\n\nResearchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have made several milestone discoveries in the field of biomedical research and therapeutics. Recent discoveries include the development of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer by the lab of Angela Brodie, and the discovery of calcium sparks as drivers of heart contraction by the lab of Jonathan Lederer.\n\nThe School of Medicine is a research-focused academic institution, with $537 million in extramural research funding in 2018. A large portion of that research funding comes from the federal government of the United States. , over $148 million in research grants from the NIH were attributed to the parent university of the School of Medicine. Focus areas of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's research include cancer research, cardiovascular research, neuroscience, and virology.\n\nThe School of Medicine has extensive operations in research education. Together with the Graduate Program in Life Sciences, the school provides research teaching and oversees the award of Ph.D. degrees across multiple research tracks. The School of Medicine is one of only 50 medical institutions in the United States to offer a Medical Scientist Training Program.\n\nThe School of Medicine has launched several research centers and institutes dedicated to specific fields of research:\n\nThe Institute of Human Virology (IHV) was formed in 1996 as a research institute of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, headed and co-founded by Robert Gallo, the only recipient of two Lasker Awards for the discovery of the first human retrovirus, and the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS. IHV operates in a dedicated building on the UMSOM campus next to the University of Maryland Medical Center as a partnership between the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore, the University System of Maryland and the University of Maryland Medical System.\n\nLaunched in 2007, the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) is an internationally recognized genomics research center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. IGS investigators use genomic and bioinformatic tools to research genome function in health and diseases and work in interdisciplinary collaborations with biomedical investigators. IGS is led by Dr. Claire M. Fraser-Liggett. Research areas include: Bioinformatics, Cancer Genomics, Functional Genomics, Human Genetic Variation, Infectious Diseases, Organismal Diversity and Evolution, Human Microbiome Project, Plant Genomics, and Microbial Community Ecology. Investigators at IGS work on Disease Ontology research, the Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) for HMP, and other grants. IGS is one of the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases (GSCID) centers designated by NIAID.\n\nThe Institute for Global Health (IGH) was established in 2015 and is dedicated to improving global health by conducting innovative, world-leading research around the world. The IGH develops new and improved ways of diagnosing, preventing, treating, controlling and eradicating diseases of global impact. Such diseases include malaria, Ebola and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases such as measles. The IGH includes the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) and the Division of Malaria Research.\n\nThe MPRC was established on the grounds of Spring Grove Hospital as a result of public interest in the research pioneered there on the use of the psychedelic compound LSD in Schizophrenia research. The first of this series of experiments, which came to be known as the Spring Grove Experiment, began in 1955 in cottage 13 of the hospital grounds. The study was largely conducted by the members of the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, and became the largest study on psychedelic drugs in psychiatric research. After the study gained media publicity, research funding was made available and Spring Grove was rebuilt into the MPRC, a division of the department of Psychiatry of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Currently, MPRC hosts over 20 clinical and basic research faculty that form its core research program into psychiatric disease. MPRC is also the editorial seat for the Schizophrenia Bulletin, a peer-reviewed medical journal dedicated to schizophrenia research.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2161615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161615", "title": "Rasch model", "text": "Rasch model\n\nThe Rasch model, named after Georg Rasch, is a psychometric model for analyzing categorical data, such as answers to questions on a reading assessment or questionnaire responses, as a function of the trade-off between (a) the respondent's abilities, attitudes, or personality traits and (b) the item difficulty. For example, they may be used to estimate a student's reading ability or the extremity of a person's attitude to capital punishment from responses on a questionnaire. In addition to psychometrics and educational research, the Rasch model and its extensions are used in other areas, including the health profession and market research because of their general applicability.\n\nThe mathematical theory underlying Rasch models is a special case of item response theory and, more generally, a special case of a generalized linear model. However, there are important differences in the interpretation of the model parameters and its philosophical implications that separate proponents of the Rasch model from the item response modeling tradition. A central aspect of this divide relates to the role of specific objectivity, a defining property of the Rasch model according to Georg Rasch, as a requirement for successful measurement.\n\nIn the Rasch model, the probability of a specified response (e.g. right/wrong answer) is modeled as a function of person and item parameters. Specifically, in the original Rasch model, the probability of a correct response is modeled as a logistic function of the difference between the person and item parameter. The mathematical form of the model is provided later in this article. In most contexts, the parameters of the model characterize the proficiency of the respondents and the difficulty of the items as locations on a continuous latent variable. For example, in educational tests, item parameters represent the difficulty of items while person parameters represent the ability or attainment level of people who are assessed. The higher a person's ability relative to the difficulty of an item, the higher the probability of a correct response on that item. When a person's location on the latent trait is equal to the difficulty of the item, there is by definition a 0.5 probability of a correct response in the Rasch model.\n\nA Rasch model is a \"model\" in one sense in that it represents the structure which data should exhibit in order to obtain measurements from the data; i.e. it provides a criterion for successful measurement. Beyond data, Rasch's equations model relationships we expect to obtain in the real world. For instance, education is intended to prepare children for the entire range of challenges they will face in life, and not just those that appear in textbooks or on tests. By requiring measures to remain the same (invariant) across different tests measuring the same thing, Rasch models make it possible to test the hypothesis that the particular challenges posed in a curriculum and on a test coherently represent the infinite population of all possible challenges in that domain. A Rasch model is therefore a model in the sense of an \"ideal\" or standard that provides a heuristic fiction serving as a useful organizing principle even when it is never actually observed in practice.\n\nThe perspective or paradigm underpinning the Rasch model is distinct from the perspective underpinning statistical modelling. Models are most often used with the intention of describing a set of data. Parameters are modified and accepted or rejected based on how well they fit the data. In contrast, when the Rasch model is employed, the objective is to obtain data which fit the model (Andrich, 2004; Wright, 1984, 1999). The rationale for this perspective is that the Rasch model embodies requirements which must be met in order to obtain measurement, in the sense that measurement is generally understood in the physical sciences.\n\nA useful analogy for understanding this rationale is to consider objects measured on a weighing scale. Suppose the weight of an object A is measured as being substantially greater than the weight of an object B on one occasion, then immediately afterward the weight of object B is measured as being substantially greater than the weight of object A. A property we require of measurements is that the resulting comparison between objects should be the same, or invariant, irrespective of other factors. This key requirement is embodied within the formal structure of the Rasch model. Consequently, the Rasch model is not altered to suit data. Instead, the method of assessment should be changed so that this requirement is met, in the same way that a weighing scale should be rectified if it gives different comparisons between objects upon separate measurements of the objects.\n\nData analysed using the model are usually responses to conventional items on tests, such as educational tests with right/wrong answers. However, the model is a general one, and can be applied wherever discrete data are obtained with the intention of measuring a quantitative attribute or trait.\n\nWhen all test-takers have an opportunity to attempt all items on a single test, each total score on the test maps to a unique estimate of ability and the greater the total, the greater the ability estimate. Total scores do not have a linear relationship with ability estimates. Rather, the relationship is non-linear as shown in Figure 1. The total score is shown on the vertical axis, while the corresponding person location estimate is shown on the horizontal axis. For the particular test on which the test characteristic curve (TCC) shown in Figure 1 is based, the relationship is approximately linear throughout the range of total scores from about 10 to 33. The shape of the TCC is generally somewhat sigmoid as in this example. However, the precise relationship between total scores and person location estimates depends on the distribution of items on the test. The TCC is steeper in ranges on the continuum in which there are a number of items, such as in the range on either side of 0 in Figures 1 and 2.\n\nIn applying the Rasch model, item locations are often scaled first, based on methods such as those described below. This part of the process of scaling is often referred to as item \"calibration\". In educational tests, the smaller the proportion of correct responses, the higher the difficulty of an item and hence the higher the item's scale location. Once item locations are scaled, the person locations are measured on the scale. As a result, person and item locations are estimated on a single scale as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFor dichotomous data such as right/wrong answers, by definition, the location of an item on a scale corresponds with the person location at which there is a 0.5 probability of a correct response to the question. In general, the probability of a person responding correctly to a question with difficulty lower than that person's location is greater than 0.5, while the probability of responding correctly to a question with difficulty greater than the person's location is less than 0.5. The Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) or Item Response Function (IRF) shows the probability of a correct response as a function of the ability of persons. A single ICC is shown and explained in more detail in relation to Figure 4 in this article (see also the item response function). The leftmost ICCs in Figure 3 are the easiest items, the rightmost items in the same figure are the most difficult items.\n\nWhen responses of a person are listed according to item difficulty, from lowest to highest, the most likely pattern is a Guttman pattern or vector; i.e. {1,1...,1,0,0,0...,0}. However, while this pattern is the most probable given the structure of the Rasch model, the model requires only probabilistic Guttman response patterns; that is, patterns which tend toward the Guttman pattern. It is unusual for responses to conform strictly to the pattern because there are many possible patterns. It is unnecessary for responses to conform strictly to the pattern in order for data to fit the Rasch model.\n\nEach ability estimate has an associated standard error of measurement, which quantifies the degree of uncertainty associated with the ability estimate. Item estimates also have standard errors. Generally, the standard errors of item estimates are considerably smaller than the standard errors of person estimates because there are usually more response data for an item than for a person. That is, the number of people attempting a given item is usually greater than the number of items attempted by a given person. Standard errors of person estimates are smaller where the slope of the ICC is steeper, which is generally through the middle range of scores on a test. Thus, there is greater precision in this range since the steeper the slope, the greater the distinction between any two points on the line.\n\nStatistical and graphical tests are used to evaluate the correspondence of data with the model. Certain tests are global, while others focus on specific items or people. Certain tests of fit provide information about which items can be used to increase the reliability of a test by omitting or correcting problems with poor items. In Rasch Measurement the person separation index is used instead of reliability indices. However, the person separation index is analogous to a reliability index. The separation index is a summary of the genuine separation as a ratio to separation including measurement error. As mentioned earlier, the level of measurement error is not uniform across the range of a test, but is generally larger for more extreme scores (low and high).\n\nThe class of models is named after Georg Rasch, a Danish mathematician and statistician who advanced the epistemological case for the models based on their congruence with a core requirement of measurement in physics; namely the requirement of \"invariant comparison\". This is the defining feature of the class of models, as is elaborated upon in the following section. The Rasch model for dichotomous data has a close conceptual relationship to the law of comparative judgment (LCJ), a model formulated and used extensively by L. L. Thurstone, and therefore also to the Thurstone scale.\n\nPrior to introducing the measurement model he is best known for, Rasch had applied the Poisson distribution to reading data as a measurement model, hypothesizing that in the relevant empirical context, the number of errors made by a given individual was governed by the ratio of the text difficulty to the person's reading ability. Rasch referred to this model as the \"multiplicative Poisson model\". Rasch's model for dichotomous data – i.e. where responses are classifiable into two categories – is his most widely known and used model, and is the main focus here. This model has the form of a simple logistic function.\n\nThe brief outline above highlights certain distinctive and interrelated features of Rasch's perspective on social measurement, which are as follows:\n\n\nThus, congruent with the perspective articulated by Thomas Kuhn in his 1961 paper \"The function of measurement in modern physical science\", measurement was regarded both as being founded in theory, and as being instrumental to detecting quantitative anomalies incongruent with hypotheses related to a broader theoretical framework. This perspective is in contrast to that generally prevailing in the social sciences, in which data such as test scores are directly treated as measurements without requiring a theoretical foundation for measurement. Although this contrast exists, Rasch's perspective is actually complementary to the use of statistical analysis or modelling that requires interval-level measurements, because the purpose of applying a Rasch model is to obtain such measurements. Applications of Rasch models are described in a wide variety of sources, including Alagumalai, Curtis & Hungi (2005), Bezruczko (2005), Bond & Fox (2007), Burro (2016), Fisher & Wright (1994), Masters & Keeves (1999), and the \"Journal of Applied Measurement\".\n\nThe Rasch model for dichotomous data is often regarded as an item response theory (IRT) model with one item parameter. However, rather than being a particular IRT model, proponents of the model regard it as a model that possesses a property which distinguishes it from other IRT models. Specifically, the defining property of Rasch models is their formal or mathematical \"embodiment\" of the principle of invariant comparison. Rasch summarised the principle of invariant comparison as follows:\n\nRasch models embody this principle because their formal structure permits algebraic separation of the person and item parameters, in the sense that the person parameter can be \"eliminated\" during the process of statistical estimation of item parameters. This result is achieved through the use of conditional maximum likelihood estimation, in which the response space is partitioned according to person total scores. The consequence is that the raw score for an item or person is the sufficient statistic for the item or person parameter. That is to say, the person total score contains all information available within the specified context about the individual, and the item total score contains all information with respect to item, with regard to the relevant latent trait. The Rasch model requires a specific structure in the response data, namely a probabilistic Guttman structure.\n\nIn somewhat more familiar terms, Rasch models provide a basis and justification for obtaining person locations on a continuum from total scores on assessments. Although it is not uncommon to treat total scores directly as measurements, they are actually counts of discrete observations rather than measurements. Each observation represents the observable outcome of a comparison between a person and item. Such outcomes are directly analogous to the observation of the rotation of a balance scale in one direction or another. This observation would indicate that one or other object has a greater mass, but counts of such observations cannot be treated directly as measurements.\n\nRasch pointed out that the principle of invariant comparison is characteristic of measurement in physics using, by way of example, a two-way experimental frame of reference in which each instrument exerts a mechanical force upon solid bodies to produce acceleration. Rasch stated of this context: \"Generally: If for any two objects we find a certain ratio of their accelerations produced by one instrument, then the same ratio will be found for any other of the instruments\". It is readily shown that Newton's second law entails that such ratios are inversely proportional to the ratios of the masses of the bodies.\n\nLet formula_1 be a dichotomous random variable where, for example, formula_2 denotes a correct response and formula_3 an incorrect response to a given assessment item. In the Rasch model for dichotomous data, the probability of the outcome formula_4 is given by:\n\nwhere formula_6 is the ability of person formula_7 and formula_8 is the difficulty of item formula_9. Thus, in the case of a dichotomous attainment item, formula_10 is the probability of success upon interaction between the relevant person and assessment item. It is readily shown that the log odds, or logit, of correct response by a person to an item, based on the model, is equal to formula_11. Given two examinees with different ability parameters formula_12 and formula_13 and an arbitrary item with difficulty formula_8, compute the difference in logits for these two examinees by formula_15. This difference becomes formula_16. Conversely, it can be shown that the log odds of a correct response by the same person to one item, \"conditional\" on a correct response to one of two items, is equal to the difference between the item locations. For example,\n\nwhere formula_18 is the total score of person \"n\" over the two items, which implies a correct response to one or other of the items. Hence, the conditional log odds does not involve the person parameter formula_19, which can therefore be \"eliminated\" by conditioning on the total score formula_20. That is, by partitioning the responses according to raw scores and calculating the log odds of a correct response, an estimate formula_21 is obtained without involvement of formula_19. More generally, a number of item parameters can be estimated iteratively through application of a process such as Conditional Maximum Likelihood estimation (see Rasch model estimation). While more involved, the same fundamental principle applies in such estimations.\n\nThe ICC of the Rasch model for dichotomous data is shown in Figure 4. The grey line maps the probability of the discrete outcome formula_23 (that is, correctly answering the question) for persons with different locations on the latent continuum (that is, their level of abilities). The location of an item is, by definition, that location at which the probability that formula_23 is equal to 0.5. In figure 4, the black circles represent the actual or observed proportions of persons within Class Intervals for which the outcome was observed. For example, in the case of an assessment item used in the context of educational psychology, these could represent the proportions of persons who answered the item correctly. Persons are ordered by the estimates of their locations on the latent continuum and classified into Class Intervals on this basis in order to graphically inspect the accordance of observations with the model. There is a close conformity of the data with the model. In addition to graphical inspection of data, a range of statistical tests of fit are used to evaluate whether departures of observations from the model can be attributed to random effects alone, as required, or whether there are systematic departures from the model.\n\nThere are multiple polytomous extensions to the Rasch model, which generalize the dichotomous model so that it can be applied in contexts in which successive integer scores represent categories of increasing level or magnitude of a latent trait, such as increasing ability, motor function, endorsement of a statement, and so forth. These polytomous extensions are, for example, applicable to the use of Likert scales, grading in educational assessment, and scoring of performances by judges.\n\nA criticism of the Rasch model is that it is overly restrictive or prescriptive because an assumption of the model is that all items have equal discrimination, whereas in practice, items discriminations vary, and thus no dataset will ever show perfect data-model fit. A frequent misunderstanding is that the Rasch model does not permit each item to have a different discrimination, but equal discrimination is an assumption of invariant measurement, so differing item discriminations are not forbidden, but rather indicate that measurement quality does not equal a theoretical ideal. Just as in physical measurement, real world datasets will never perfectly match theoretical models, so the relevant question is whether a particular dataset provides sufficient quality of measurement for the purpose at hand, not whether it perfectly matches an unattainable standard of perfection.\n\nA criticism specific to the use of the Rasch model with response data from multiple choice items is that there is no provision in the model for guessing because the left asymptote always approaches a zero probability in the Rasch model. This implies that a person of low ability will always get an item wrong. However, low-ability individuals completing a multiple-choice exam have a substantially higher probability of choosing the correct answer by chance alone (for a \"k\"-option item, the likelihood is around 1/\"k\").\n\nThe three-parameter logistic model relaxes both these assumptions and the two-parameter logistic model allows varying slopes. However, the specification of uniform discrimination and zero left asymptote are necessary properties of the model in order to sustain sufficiency of the simple, unweighted raw score. In practice, the non-zero lower asymptote found in multiple-choice datasets is less of a threat to measurement than commonly assumed and typically does not result in substantive errors in measurement when well-developed test items are used sensibly \n\nVerhelst & Glas (1995) derive Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) equations for a model they refer to as the One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM). In algebraic form it appears to be identical with the 2PL model, but OPLM contains preset discrimination indexes rather than 2PL's estimated discrimination parameters. As noted by these authors, though, the problem one faces in estimation with estimated discrimination parameters is that the discriminations are unknown, meaning that the weighted raw score \"is not a mere statistic, and hence it is impossible to use CML as an estimation method\" (Verhelst & Glas, 1995, p. 217). That is, sufficiency of the weighted \"score\" in the 2PL cannot be used according to the way in which a sufficient statistic is defined. If the weights are imputed instead of being estimated, as in OPLM, conditional estimation is possible and some of the properties of the Rasch model are retained (Verhelst, Glas & Verstralen, 1995; Verhelst & Glas, 1995). In OPLM, the values of the discrimination index are restricted to between 1 and 15. A limitation of this approach is that in practice, values of discrimination indexes must be preset as a starting point. This means some type of estimation of discrimination is involved when the purpose is to avoid doing so.\n\nThe Rasch model for dichotomous data inherently entails a single discrimination parameter which, as noted by Rasch, constitutes an arbitrary choice of the unit in terms of which magnitudes of the latent trait are expressed or estimated. However, the Rasch model requires that the discrimination is uniform across interactions between persons and items within a specified frame of reference (i.e. the assessment context given conditions for assessment).\n\nApplication of the model provides diagnostic information regarding how well the criterion is met. Application of the model can also provide information about how well items or questions on assessments work to measure the ability or trait. For instance, knowing the proportion of persons that engage in a given behavior, the Rasch model can be used to derive the relations between difficulty of behaviors, attitudes and behaviors. Prominent advocates of Rasch models include Benjamin Drake Wright, David Andrich and Erling Andersen.\n\n\n\n"}

During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the village was razed by Nazi forces as reprisal for Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich's assassination in late spring 1942.\n\nLežáky was inhabited by poor stonecutters and cottagers living in eight houses near the mill. The village was named after the Ležák rivulet.\n\nBeginning 24 September 1941, SS-\"Obergruppenführer\" and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich was Acting \"Reichsprotektor\" for the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The area had been occupied by Nazi Germany since 5 April 1939.\n\nIn December 1941, several Allied paratroopers were dropped into the region. Some were sent to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich in an action known as Operation Anthropoid. Another group was part of Operation Silver A. Several Ležáky residents helped the latter group by providing a hiding place for their radio set.\n\nOn the morning of 27 May 1942, Heydrich's car was attacked by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, Czech and Slovak soldiers acting for the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Heydrich died on 4 June 1942.\n\nAfter the assassination, the Nazis imposed martial law. On 10 June, the village of Lidice was razed and all male inhabitants aged over 15 were shot. Lidice was selected because its residents were falsely accused of harbouring local resistance partisans and aiding \"Operation Anthropoid\" team members.\n\nThereafter, Gestapo agents found a radio transmitter in Ležáky which belonged to Operation Silver A. Alfréd Bartoš, the leader of resistance group Silver A, killed himself shortly thereafter. On 24 June, approximately 500 SS troops and policemen surrounded Ležáky, removed all inhabitants, and the village was destroyed. All 33 adults (both men and women) were shot. Thirteen children were spared. A 26 June press release announced the outcome. In mid-December 1943, the Ležáky ruins were removed by 65 men from Nazi work camps.\n\nOf the thirteen children, sisters Jarmila and Marie Šťulík were selected for \"Germanization\"; both were located and returned to their families after the war. The remaining eleven children were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp, where they were gassed in summer 1942, together with one girl from Lidice.\n\nUnlike Lidice, Ležáky was not rebuilt after the war, and only memorials remain today.\n\n\n"}

He also reached the World Championship final in 1999, 2002 and 2006, losing to Phil Taylor on each occasion. Declining form led to him losing his place on the PDC tour in 2011. \n\nHe was nicknamed One Dart by commentator Tony Green after hitting the winning double on numerous occasions with his first dart during his first televised appearance at the 1995 Unipart European Masters, where he eventually lost in the final to Mike Gregory. Manley was also known for his walk on and personality. Described as someone whom \"darts crowds love to hate\", his antics sometimes led to run-ins with fellow players.\n\nManley debut in 1996 PDC World Matchplay Last 40 to Paul Cook 5-2 in Last 32 to Dave Kelly 8-2 and Last 16 his losing to Jamie Harvey 8-3.\n\nManley's controversial personality rather than the quality of his darts was often the most notable part of his career and continued poor form resulted in him failing to secure a PDC tour card in 2012. Manley lost several major sponsors including darts manufacturer Unicorn as a result.\nManley is perhaps most famous for his long-running feud with Phil Taylor resulting from his refusal to shake Taylor's hand after losing 7-0 to him in the 2002 PDC World Darts Championship final. He has finished runner-up to Taylor in two other World Championships - losing 6-2 in 1999 and 7-0 in 2006.\n\nHis biggest tournament win was 2003 Las Vegas Desert Classic when he beat John Part 16-12 in the final. He is also the chairman of the Professional Dart Players Association, a position he has held for six years. Manley attempted getting a PDC Tour card in the Q-School in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 but was unsuccessful.\n\nManley's refusal to shake Taylor's hand after his 7-0 World Championship thrashing in 2002 led to darts fans booing him for many years. The boos became more ironic and good-natured when in 2005 Manley changed his entrance theme from Chumbawamba's \"Tubthumping\" to Tony Christie's \"Is This the Way to Amarillo\". By the end of his career Manley was seen by darts crowds as being more of a 'pantomime villain' rather than subject to genuine animosity which had occurred previously. Manley has even gone on to say that whilst the booing and crowd reaction was hard for him and his family to take in the early days, it helped him as his career went on and ensured his popularity on the exhibition circuit.\n\nDespite being chairman of the Players' Union (the Professional Dart Players Association - PDPA), Manley was often the subject of controversy with fellow players. Most notably Taylor in the aforementioned incident, and also in the 2006 PDC World Darts Championship. During that tournament, Manley was accused of gamesmanship against Dennis Smith and in a later round against Taylor's protégé, Adrian Lewis. Manley muttered words to his opponent, resulting in Lewis leaving the stage in anger. Despite serving as Mardle's best man at his wedding Manley also had a notable spat with the former PDC professional player Wayne Mardle. Mardle accused Manley of being a cheat in his autobiography. Manley has also had notable spats with the likes of Roland Scholten, John Lowe, Rod Harrington, Dave Jowett and Wynand Havenga.\n\nManley currently resides in Carlisle.

Even with their high price and the advent of organic synthesis, rose oils are still perhaps the most widely used essential oil in perfumery.\n\nTwo major species of rose are cultivated for the production of rose oil:\nThe most common chemical compounds present in rose oil are:\n\nThe key flavor compounds that contribute to the distinctive scent of rose oil, however, are beta-damascenone, beta-damascone, beta-ionone, and rose oxide. Beta-damascenone's presence and quantity is considered as the marker for the quality of rose oil.\nEven though these compounds exist in less than 1% quantity of rose oil, they make up for slightly more than 90% of the odor content due to their low odor detection thresholds. The price per sample container varies anywhere from USD$1,740 - USD$2,550\n\nDue to the labor-intensive production process and the low content of oil in the rose blooms, rose oil commands a very high price. Harvesting of flowers is done by hand in the morning before sunrise and material is distilled the same day.\n\nThere are three main methods of extracting the oil from the plant material:\n\n\nIn the first part of the two-stage process of distillation, large stills - traditionally of copper - are filled with roses and water. The still is fired for 60–105 minutes. The vaporized water and rose oil exit the still and enter a condensing apparatus and are then collected in a flask. This distillation yields a very concentrated oil, direct oil, which makes up about 20% of the final product of the whole process. The water which condenses along with the oil is drained off and redistilled, cohobation, in order to obtain the water-soluble fractions of the rose oil such as phenethyl alcohol which are a vital component of the aroma and which make up the large bulk, 80%, of the oil. \nThe two oils are combined and make the final rose attar.\n\nRose attar is mobile in room temperature and is usually clear, light yellow in color. It will form white crystals at normal room temperature which disappear when the oil is gently warmed. It will tend to become more viscous at lower temperatures due to this crystallization of some of its components.\n\nThe essence has a very strong odor, but is pleasant when diluted and used for perfume. Attar of roses was once made in India, Persia, Syria, and the Ottoman Empire. The Rose Valley in Bulgaria, near the town of Kazanlak, is among the major producers of attar of roses in the world.\nIn India, Kannauj is an important city of fabrication of rose attar, Kannauj is nicknamed \"The Grasse of the East\" or \"The Grasse of the Orient\".\nGrasse (in France) is an important city of fabrication of rose fragance.\n\nDue to the heat required for distillation, some of the compounds extracted from the rose denature or break down chemically. As such, rose attar does not smell very similar to \"fresh\" roses.\n\nThe hydrosol portion of the distillate is known as \"rosewater\". This inexpensive by-product is used widely as a food flavoring as well as in skin care.\n\nIn the solvent extraction method, the flowers are agitated in a vat with a solvent such as hexane, which draws out the aroma compounds as well as other soluble substances such as wax and pigments. The extract is subjected to vacuum processing which removes the solvent for re-use. The remaining waxy mass is known as a \"concrete\". The concrete is then mixed with alcohol which dissolves the aromatic constituents, leaving behind the wax and other substances. The alcohol is low-pressure evaporated, leaving behind the finished absolute. The absolute may be further processed to remove any impurities that are still present from the solvent extraction.\n\nRose absolute is a deep reddish brown with no crystals. Due to the low temperatures in this process, the absolute may be more faithful to the scent of the fresh rose than the otto.\n\nA third process, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, combines the best aspects of the other two methods. When carbon dioxide is put under at least of pressure and at a temperature of at least (the critical point), it becomes a supercritical fluid with the permeation properties of a gas and the solvation properties of a liquid. (Under normal pressure CO changes directly from a solid to a gas in a process known as sublimation.) The supercritical fluid CO extracts the aromatics from the plant material.\n\nLike solvent extraction, the CO extraction takes place at a low temperature, extracts a wide range of compounds rendering an essence more faithful to the original, and leaves the aromatics unaltered by heat. Because CO is gas at normal atmospheric pressure, it leaves no trace of itself in the final product. The equipment for CO extraction is expensive, which is reflected in the price of the essential oils obtained from the process.\n\nIt takes a large amount of rose petals to distill a small amount of essential oil. Depending on extraction method and plant species, the typical yield can be approximately 1:3,000. To mitigate the cost, some dishonest dealers will dilute rose oil with geranium (\"Pelargonium graveolens\") or palmarosa (\"Cymbopogon martinii\") essential oils, both of which are rich in geraniol, the main constituent of rose oil. Some of these \"rose oils\" are up to 90% geranium or palmarosa to 10% rose. This is referred to as \"extending\" the rose fragrance. This may be done to compensate for chemotype, e.g. Bulgarian distilled rose oil is naturally low in phenylethanol, and Ukrainian or Russian rose oil is naturally high in phenylethanol. Pure rose oil should not be used directly on the skin, as it can cause allergic reactions such as red skin and spots.\n"}

In 1985, he had a trial with English team Aston Villa but they did not follow up their initial interest.\n\nIn December 1988, he was to return to England with Tottenham Hotspur, as then manager Terry Venables paid a fee of around £100,000 to Valur, a fee which was then a record sale for the Icelandic club who have since gone on to produce many other top Icelandic exports.\n\nAt Spurs, the central defender or full back teamed up with England internationals Paul Gascoigne, Gary Mabbutt, Gary Lineker and Chris Waddle. Understandably, he found it hard to make a regular breakthrough for the London club often filling in intermittently due to injuries or suspension. This did not stop him from becoming a regular for the Icelandic national team, where he eventually became captain winning in excess of 80 caps, which was a record for that country at the time.\n\nHe had his most successful spell at Spurs under the management of Venables, but he missed out on the FA Cup triumph of 1991. The appointment of Ossie Ardiles as the Tottenham manager effectively spelt the beginning of the end for Guðni, who feared a life away from football at one stage.\n\nIn 1995, after being told he could leave Spurs, Guðni began studying to become a lawyer. A trial game for Crystal Palace reserves alerted the then Bolton Wanderers manager Bruce Rioch to Guðni's availability. Rioch could not understand why such a seasoned international was struggling to find a new club. A fee of £65,000 was agreed between Bolton and Tottenham, rising to £110,000 dependent on a certain number of clauses.\n\nGuðni made his Bolton debut in the most extreme surroundings of Wembley Stadium when coming on as a substitute for Scott Green in the 1995 Football League Cup Final defeat to Liverpool. England winger Steve McManaman had given Green a torrid time throughout the afternoon but Guðni's introduction gave Bolton renewed hope, as his first touch was to supply the cross for Alan Thompson to score. This was to be the start of a lifelong affection between Bolton Wanderers and Guðni.\n\nOn the eve of the 1995–96 season, he was promoted back to the Premiership with Bolton where he proved to be a cool and assured performer in an otherwise shaky Wandererer's defence. He scored a number of vital goals against Newcastle United, Leeds United and most notably on his return to White Hart Lane as Bolton drew 2–2 with Tottenham Hotspur. Unfortunately, that season ended in relegation for Bolton, but Guðni was eager to help the club bounce back at the first attempt. In 1996–97, the club finished the season as champions of the old Division One (now Championship), with Guðni chipping in with three vital league goals, two of which came in the 7–0 defeat of relegation-haunted Swindon Town.\n\nDuring the 1997–98 season, the team relegated again, but this time the club showed much more of a fight than in their previous stint in the top league, only losing out to Everton on goal-difference on the final day. Bolton's loss at Chelsea coupled with Everton's draw against Coventry City meant that Guðni and Bolton were back in Division One. That season, Guðni scored one of the goals of the season; on 26 December 1997, Bolton played a home match against fellow strugglers Barnsley with both needing vital league points to climb away from trouble. Guðni equalised for the Trotters shortly before half time with a 35-yard shot from right-back which sailed into the top corner past the goalkeeper David Watson. The next season saw Guðni suffer a series of niggling injury problems and was one of his most frustrating seasons at Bolton. Players such as Mark Fish, Andy Todd, Jon Newsome and Paul Warhurst had all played in the heart of the defence in his absence, rumours even circulated that he may leave but this was soon dispelled.\n\nThe following 1999–2000 season saw Bolton and Guðni reach three domestic Semi-Final competitions, losing all of them. First, the club lost out to Tranmere Rovers in a two-legged League Cup semi-final, then were defeated by Premiership side Aston Villa on penalties in a hard-fought encounter at Wembley in a game which Guðni picked up a hamstring injury. Finally they faced Ipswich Town in the Divisional Play-Offs in May 2000. Both sides had drawn 2–2 in the first leg at the Reebok Stadium, this making for an excellent second leg in the return at Portman Road. The game was marred by 12 Bolton bookings, the sending off of Robbie Elliott and Mike Whitlow and three debatable Ipswich penalties. Bolton criticised the highly controversial performance of referee Barry Knight claiming that the Orpington official had given Ipswich an unfair advantage. Ipswich later won the game 5–3 after extra-time and it looked as if Guðni would be retiring from football at the age of 35.\n\nHowever, new Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce persuaded the ever reliable Guðni to sign up for another year and he did not disappoint as he scored 10 goals from defence, putting in a string of excellent performances alongside the likes of Whitlow and Colin Hendry, as Bolton ultimately returned to the Premiership following a 3–0 play off win over Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n\nWith rumours again circulating of Guðni's imminent retirement Allardyce talked him into staying for one last season. This proved to be a rocky season for Bolton, only staying up on the last day with a 2–1 victory against Middlesbrough at the Reebok Stadium. Guðni almost scored against former club Tottenham in a game in March 2003 but his header rebounded back off the post.\n\nDespite Allardyce's efforts to make him stay another season, Guðni retired. In all he made 270 league appearances for the Trotters scoring 22 goals before finally taking up a career in law.\n\nHe has, however, maintained his links with the club and is now the President of the former-players association as well acting as a part-time scout of budding Icelandic players. In 2008, he was a major influence in persuading AZ Alkmaar defender Grétar Steinsson to join Bolton.\n\nGuðni is now a certified lawyer in Iceland. Guðni had a TV-Show back in 2004 called \"Boltinn með Guðna Bergs\" that was a hit in Iceland.\n\nHe returned to play for Bolton Wanderers one more time on 8 August 2009 for a Bolton Wanderers legends football match.\n\nOn 6 March 2012, whilst going to aid a colleague who had been attacked by a man with a knife, Guðni was stabbed twice in the leg at the Reykjavik offices of the law firm Legal Support. He was later released from hospital, however his colleague remained in a critical condition. On 26 June 2012, the attacker was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Gudni received 800.000 ISK in compensation.\n\nOn 11 February 2017, Guðni was elected chairman of the Icelandic Football Association.\n\nGuðni made his debut for Iceland in 1984 and went on to earn 80 caps, scoring 1 goal. His last international came in June 2003 against Lithuania. He is number four in Iceland's all-time international appearances list, behind record-holder Rúnar Kristinsson, Hermann Hreiðarsson and Eiður Guðjohnsen.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\n"}

Born in Rio de Janeiro as the eldest daughter of Emperor Pedro II and Empress Teresa Cristina, she was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: \"Bragança\"). After the deaths of her two brothers in infancy, she was recognized as her father's heir presumptive. She married a French prince, Gaston, Count of Eu, in an arranged marriage, and they had three sons.\n\nDuring her father's absences abroad, Isabel acted as regent. In her third and final regency, she actively promoted and ultimately signed a law, named \"Lei Áurea\" or the Golden Law, emancipating all slaves in Brazil. Even though the action was broadly popular, there was strong opposition to her succession to the throne. Her gender, strong Catholic faith and marriage to a foreigner were seen as impediments against her, and the emancipation of the slaves generated dislike among powerful planters. In 1889, her family was deposed in a military coup, and she spent the last 30 years of her life in exile in France.\n\nIsabel was born at on 29 July 1846 in Rio de Janeiro's \"Paço de São Cristóvão\" (Palace of Saint Christopher). She was the daughter of Brazil's Emperor Pedro II and his wife Teresa Cristina. On 15 November the infant princess was baptized in an elaborate ceremony in \"Igreja da Glória\" (Church of Glory). Her godparents, both represented by proxy, were her uncle, King Ferdinand II of Portugal, and her maternal grandmother María Isabella of Spain. She was christened Isabel Cristina Leopoldina Augusta Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga. Her last four names were always bestowed upon the members of her family, and Isabel and Cristina honored Isabel's maternal grandmother and mother, respectively.\n\nShe was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza through her father, and from birth was referred to using the honorific \"Dona\" (English: Dame or Lady). She was the granddaughter of Brazil's Emperor Pedro I (who also briefly reigned as Portugal's King Pedro IV), and the niece of Queen Maria II of Portugal (wife of Ferdinand II). Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of Francis I and niece to Ferdinand II, both kings of the Two Sicilies in turn.\n\nAt the time of her birth, she had an elder brother named Afonso who was heir apparent to the Brazilian throne. Two other siblings followed: Leopoldina in 1847 and Pedro in 1848. Afonso's death in 1847, at the age of , propelled Isabel to the position of Pedro II's heir presumptive. She briefly lost the position with the birth of Prince Imperial Pedro. After his death in 1850, Isabel became the definitive heir as Princess Imperial, the title given to the first in the line of succession. Isabel's early years were a time of peace and prosperity in Brazil. Her parents provided a happy and healthy upbringing. She and her sister \"grew up in a stable, secure environment dramatically different from the one her father and aunts had known, and light years away from the childhood chaos of Pedro I.\"\n\nThe early death of both of his sons had an enormous impact on Pedro II. Aside from his personal grief, the loss of his sons affected his future conduct as monarch and would determine the fate of the Empire. In the Emperor's eyes, the deaths of his children seemed to portend an eventual end of the Imperial system. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer concerned him, as he increasingly saw his position as being nothing more than that of Head of State for his lifetime.\n\nThe Emperor's words revealed his inner conviction. After learning of the death of his son Pedro in 1850, he wrote: \"This has been the most fatal blow that I could receive, and certainly I would not have survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children whom I must educate so that they can assure the happiness of the country in which they were born.\" Seven years later, in 1857, when it was more than clear that no more children would be born, the Emperor wrote: \"As to their education, I will only say that the character of both the princesses ought to be shaped as suits Ladies who, it may be, will have to direct the constitutional government of an Empire such as Brazil\".\n\nAlthough the Emperor still had a legal successor in his beloved daughter Isabel, the male-dominated society of the time left him little hope that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch, given the political realities and climate. To historian Roderick J. Barman, the Emperor \"could not conceive of women, his daughters included, playing any part in governance. [...] In consequence, although he valued D. Isabel as his daughter, he simply could not accept or perceive her in cold reality as his successor or regard her as a viable ruler.\" The main reason for this behavior was his attitude toward the female gender. \"Pedro II believed, as did most men of his day\", says Barman, \"that a single woman could not manage life's problem on her own, even if she possessed the powers and authority of an empress.\"\n\nIsabel began her education on 1 May 1854, when she was taught how to read and write by a male instructor, who was openly republican. As the Portuguese (and later Brazilian) court tradition demanded, the heir of the throne was supposed to have an \"aio\" (supervisor, tutor or governess) in charge of his education once he achieved the age of seven. After a long search, Pedro II chose the Brazilian-born Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, the Countess of Barral, daughter of a Brazilian noble and wife of a French noble. Barral assumed her position on 9 September 1856, when Isabel was ten years old. The 40-year-old Countess was a charming and vivacious woman who soon captured the heart of Isabel and became to the young princess a kind of a role model.\n\nIn Pedro II's own words, his daughters' education \"should not differ from that given to men, combined with that suited the other sex, but in a manner that does not distract from the first.\" He \"provided his daughters with a broad, democratic and rigorous education, through both its curriculum and the teachers who taught it.\" For over nine and a half hours per day and six days per week, Isabel and her sister were in class. Subjects were broad and included Portuguese and French literature, astronomy, chemistry, the history of Portugal, England and France, drawing, piano, dancing, political economy, geography, geology, and the history of philosophy. As an adult, beyond her native Portuguese, Isabel became fluent in French, English and German.\n\nAmong her teachers were Barral, others who had taught her father as a child, and even Pedro II, who gave lessons in Latin, geometry, and astronomy. The education provided to Isabel was lacking, however. All she assimilated were abstract ideas which did not teach her \"how to integrate\" them \"with practical application\". Her tutors and parents did not prepare her to rule Brazil, nor to understand its political and social issues. A way of preparing her for a role as future Empress \"would have been to give her from an early age personal experience of the tasks she would face and to relate it to what she learned in the classroom.\" That did not happen. Pedro II \"showed her no state papers. He did not discuss politics with her. He did not take her with him on his constant visits to government offices. He did not include her in the \"despacho\", the weekly meetings with the cabinet members, nor did he allow her to attend the public audiences that took place twice a week.\" She might have been officially heiress to the throne, \"but by his treatment of her Pedro II deprived the honor of any meaning.\"\n\nPedro II's behavior as a father was completely different as an emperor. A \"man remarkable for his self-control, was at his most affectionate and most outgoing with children, above all his daughters.\" His daughters, \"whom I love deeply\", as Pedro II wrote in his diary in 1861, \"both loved and admired him.\" He \"was a strict father who demanded obedience\", but who, at the same time, was very kind and concerned with his children. However, Pedro II \"found difficult if not impossible\" to grant intimacy to not only Isabel, but \"to any member of his family.\"\n\nDuring her upbringing Isabel \"absorbed from her instructors conformity to traditional gender roles. She accepted women as dependent and obedient, and indeed her mother's and her governess's behavior did not justify anything else.\" She \"did not lack powers of observation and a certain shrewdness, but she was very accepting of existence as it was and certainly not given to pondering the justification of existence for the established order.\" All this meant that Isabel would not attempt \"a position in life autonomous of her father\", even less rival him.\n\nThat happened because the Princess Imperial was \"at an essential disadvantage with her father. She had a strong personality but she could not turn it to account. As a child she did not share Pedro II's seriousness, his single mindedness, or his interest in the larger world. The coming of adolescence did not improve matters.\" In fact, she lacked introspection and had a \"tendency to take a cheerful view of life\". Also, Isabel \"did not naturally possess much patience or notable powers of endurance. She moved from one interest to another as each in turn caught her fancy. She was not afraid to speak her mind, and she held strong views. However, when she encountered something she did not like, she found it difficult to focus and organize her resistance so as to make her view prevail. She tended to flare up and then to submit or to lose interest.\"\nIsabel's mother, Teresa Cristina, \"lived for her family and found fulfillment in making her spouse and her daughters happy.\" She \"created for her family a home life that was secure, safe and predictable.\" Isabel and her sister \"loved their gentle mother and worshipped their demanding but emotionally distant father.\" From both parents, Isabel inherited a lack of racism. Pedro II surrounded himself with men \"regardless of their race.\" Historian James McMurtry Longo said that as \"her father's student, daughter, and heir Princess Isabel followed his example. Race never played a role in her social life, political relationships, alliances or disagreements.\" And concludes: \"It may have been the most important lesson learned from him.\"\n\nThe Imperial family lived in São Cristóvão palace but during the summer (from December to April) went to Pedro II's palace in Petrópolis (nowadays the Imperial Museum of Brazil). Isabel lived an almost completely secluded life from the outside world, far away from the eyes of the Brazilians. She and her sisters had a few friends. Three of them would remain lifelong friends of Isabel: Maria Ribeiro de Avelar (whose mother was a childhood friend of Pedro II's sisters), Maria Amanda de Paranaguá (daughter of João Lustosa da Cunha Paranaguá, the 2nd Marquis of Paranaguá, a member of the Liberal Party and later Prime Minister) and Adelaide Taunay (daughter of Pedro II's former teacher Félix Émile Taunay and sister of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay). The sole male child who was part of Isabel's all female group was Dominique, the only son of the Countess of Barral, who was regarded by the Princess Imperial and her sister as \"the younger brother they never had\".\n\nIsabel was short, had blue eyes, blond hair, was a little overweight and lacked eyebrows. Her father sought a match among the royal house of France, and initially Pierre, Duke of Penthièvre, the son of the Prince of Joinville, was considered. His mother was Isabel's aunt Princess Francisca of Brazil. Pierre, however, was not interested and declined. Instead, Joinville suggested his nephews, Gaston, Count of Eu, and Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as suitable choices for the imperial princesses. The two young men travelled to Brazil in August 1864 so that the prospective brides and grooms could meet before a final agreement to the marriage. Isabel and Leopoldina were not informed until Gaston and August were mid-Atlantic. Arriving in early September, Gaston described the princesses as \"ugly\", but thought Isabel less so than her sister. For her part, Isabel in her own words \"began to feel a great and tender love\" for Gaston. Gaston and Isabel, and August and Leopoldina, were engaged on 18 September.\n\nOn 15 October, Gaston and Isabel were married at the Imperial Chapel in Rio by the archbishop of Bahia. Although Gaston encouraged his wife to read broadly, and the Emperor took her on tours of government offices, her outlook remained one of narrow domesticity. She led a life typical of aristocratic women of her generation. For the first six months of 1865, she and her husband toured Europe. As Brazil had broken off diplomatic relations with Britain, and her French relations had been deposed in France, they travelled as private citizens and met Queen Victoria as relatives not as official state guests. On their return to Brazil, Gaston was called to the battle front of the Paraguayan War by the Emperor, leaving Isabel lonely at Rio. After the conclusion of the war in 1870, Gaston and Isabel again toured Europe. In early 1871, they were in Vienna, where her sister Leopoldina fell fatally ill and died, leaving Isabel the sole surviving child of her parents.\n\nGaston and Isabel returned to Brazil on 1 May 1871, just three weeks before the Emperor and Empress embarked on their own tour of Europe. Isabel was appointed regent with full powers to govern Brazil in the Emperor's absence, though prime minister José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco, and Gaston were expected to hold the reins of power in reality. Following the abolition of slavery in the United States, Pedro II was committed to a gradual program of liberation. On 27 September 1871, with the Emperor still abroad, Isabel signed a new anti-slavery act, passed by the Chamber of Deputies. The Law of Free Birth, as it was called, freed all children born of slaves after that date. On Pedro II's return to Brazil in March 1872, Isabel was once again excluded from government, and resumed private life.\n\nThroughout the first years of her marriage, Isabel was eager to have children, but her first pregnancy ended in miscarriage in October 1872. Worried about her apparent inability to conceive, during a visit to Europe in 1873 she consulted a specialist doctor, and visited the shrine at Lourdes. By December 1873, she was pregnant. Despite Isabel's pleas to remain in Europe until after the birth, the Emperor insisted she returned to Brazil so that the child, who might inherit the throne, would not be born abroad. They arrived at Rio in June 1874. After a labor of 50 hours in late July, the baby died in the womb. Her Catholic faith provided some solace, but her association with ultramontanism, which emphasized the authority of the Church over the government, drew criticism from those who thought the Church should defer to temporal authorities.\n\nIsabel remained concerned throughout her third pregnancy, in 1875, fearful that it would again end in failure. A doctor and midwife from France were brought over for the birth, to the dismay of local physicians whose pride was wounded by Isabel's use of foreign practitioners. After a labor of 13 hours, a boy, baptized Pedro de Alcântara after his grandfather, was delivered with the aid of forceps. Possibly as the result of the difficult delivery, Pedro was born with a disabled left arm.\n\nThe Emperor embarked on a major tour of North America, Europe and the Middle East in March 1876, and Isabel was again made regent. Elections later in the year returned the incumbent government (led by the Duke of Caxias) but fraud and violence during the campaign damaged both its and Isabel's reputations. Her popularity also suffered as a result of continued tension between the Church and State. Adding to her stress, she miscarried on 11 September 1876, and was weakened by loss of blood. At the same time, her husband was also ill with bronchitis, as a result of which he was virtually bed-ridden for three weeks. The couple decided to withdraw from public life, as Gaston explained, \"When the princess is no longer seen every day in the streets of Rio, she is forgotten for a while and there is less temptation to denounce each of her acts and decisions to a discontented public.\" Their seclusion, however, left them isolated and unable to influence public opinion. Throughout the middle of 1877, during a serious drought in northeastern Brazil that threatened public order, Isabel largely remained at home resting because she was again going through a difficult pregnancy.\n\nOn Pedro II's return to Brazil in late September 1877, he avoided speaking to Isabel, and distanced himself from the government's actions during the regency by declaring that throughout his entire journey he had not sent \"a single telegram on the country's affairs\" to any minister or Isabel. Isabel retired to her estate at Petrópolis where she gave birth to a second son, Luiz, in late January 1878. Three months later, Gaston, Isabel and their two sons left Brazil for an extended stay in Europe, where Pedro was to receive medical treatment for his arm. Throughout their stay of three and a half years, Isabel avoided politics and showed no interest in current affairs. Pedro's treatment proved futile, and the couple made plans to return after the birth (with the assistance of forceps) of their final child and third son, Antônio, in August 1881. Isabel and her family returned to Brazil in December 1881.\n\nFrom November 1884 to March 1885, Isabel toured southern Brazil with her husband, and in January 1887 they left Brazil for a six-month visit to Europe. Their trip was cut short, however, as Pedro II fell ill in March, and they returned in early June. The Emperor was advised to seek medical help in Europe, as a result of which he left Brazil on 30 June, leaving Isabel as regent.\n\nAbolitionism in Brazil was growing in strength, but the government of Conservative João Maurício Wanderley, Baron of Cotegipe, attempted to slow the pace of reform. Isabel, in her own words, \"became ever more convinced that some action had to be taken\" to expand the emancipation program, and pressured Cotegipe, unsuccessfully, to free more slaves. After the Rio police's mishandling of a pro-abolition demonstration in early 1888, Isabel acted, and appointed João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira in Cotegipe's place.\n\nOliveira's government supported unconditional abolition, and swiftly introduced legislation. On 13 May 1888, Isabel signed the Golden Law (\"A Lei Áurea\"), as it was known, which enabled the complete cessation of slavery. Isabel was popularly acclaimed as \"the Redemptress\" (\"A Redentora\"), and was given a Golden Rose by Pope Leo XIII for her actions.\n\nIn August 1888, to Isabel's relief, Pedro II returned from Europe and her regency ended. Gaston wrote:\n\nWith the Emperor ill and Isabel withdrawn from public life, no effort was made to capitalize on the public popularity engendered by the end of slavery. They had lost the support of slave-owning plantation owners, who held great political, economic and social power. Isabel was uninterested in politics and did not cultivate politicians or public support. Her religious zeal was distrusted, and it was widely assumed that if she became Empress Gaston would hold power, but Gaston was isolated because of his increasing deafness, and was unpopular because of his foreign birth. Her position was further weakened by the intrigues of her nephew Prince Pedro Augusto of Saxe-Coburg, who was maneuvering to be recognized as Pedro II's heir. Pedro Augusto was told bluntly by his younger brother, \"the succession does not belong to her [Isabel], nor to the maimed [Isabel's eldest son Pedro], nor to the deaf [Gaston], nor to you either.\"\n\nOn 15 November 1889, Pedro II was deposed in a military coup. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward, and simply commented: \"If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.\" Within two days, he and his family were on their way to exile in Europe.\n\nIsabel released a public statement that read:\nThe imperial family arrived at Lisbon on 7 December 1889. Three weeks later, Isabel's mother died at Porto, while Isabel and her family were in southern Spain. Back in Portugal, Isabel fainted at her mother's lying in state. Further bad news came from Brazil, as the new government abolished the imperial family's allowances, their only substantial source of income, and declared the family banished. On the back of a large loan from a Portuguese businessman, the imperial family moved into the Hotel Beau Séjour at Cannes.\n\nIn early 1890, Isabel and Gaston moved into a private villa, which was far cheaper than the hotel, but their father refused to accompany them and remained at the Beau Séjour. Gaston's father provided them with a monthly allowance. By September, they had taken a villa near Versailles and their sons were enrolled in Parisian schools. Isabel's father died in December 1891, and his property in Brazil was sold with much of the proceeds used to pay off his debts in Europe. Isabel and Gaston purchased a villa in Boulogne-sur-Seine, where they lived an essentially quiet life. Attempts by Brazilian monarchists to restore the crown were unsuccessful, and Isabel lent them only half-hearted support. She thought military action unwise and unwelcome, and correctly assumed that it was unlikely to succeed.\n\nGaston's father died in 1896, and Gaston's inheritance gave him and Isabel financial security. Their three sons enrolled at a military school in Vienna, and Isabel continued her charitable work associated with the Catholic Church. In 1905, Gaston purchased the château d'Eu in Normandy, the former home of King Louis Philippe I, and the couple furnished it with items received from Brazil in the early 1890s.\n\nBy 1908, Isabel's eldest son Pedro wanted to marry an Austro-Hungarian aristocrat Countess Elisabeth Dobržensky de Dobrženicz, but Gaston and Isabel withheld consent because Elisabeth was not a princess. Their consent was only forthcoming when their second son, Luiz, who had travelled to Brazil but had been forbidden to land by the authorities, married Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Naples and Pedro renounced his claim to the Brazilian throne in favor of his brother. Luiz and his youngest brother Antônio both served in the British army during World War I (as members of the French royal family they were forbidden to serve in the French military). Luiz was invalided from active service in 1915, and Antônio died from wounds sustained in an air crash shortly after the armistice. Isabel wrote to Gaston that she \"went out of [her] mind\" with grief \"but the Good Lord restored it.\" Just three months later, Luiz died after a long illness. Isabel's own health was deteriorating, and by 1921 she was barely able to walk. She was too ill to travel to Brazil when the republican government lifted the family's banishment in 1920. Gaston and Pedro revisited Brazil in early 1921, for the reburial of Isabel's parents in Petrópolis Cathedral. Isabel died before the end of the year, and was buried in her husband's family tomb at Dreux's chapel royal. Gaston died the following year. In 1953, the remains of Gaston and Isabel were repatriated to Brazil, and in 1971 they were interred in the Cathedral of Petrópolis.\n\nHistorian Roderick J. Barman wrote that \"in the view of posterity, [Isabel] acted decisively only once on a single issue: the immediate abolition of slavery\". It is for this achievement that she is remembered. As explained by Barman, paradoxically this \"principal exercise of power by which posterity alone remembers her ... contributed to her exclusion from public life\". Isabel herself wrote, on the day after the republican coup d'état that deposed her father, \"If abolition is the cause for this, I don't regret it; I consider it worth losing the throne for.\"\n\n\nThe Princess's full style and title was \"Her Imperial Highness \"Senhora Dona\" Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil.\"\n\nPrincess Isabel was a recipient of the following Brazilian orders:\n\n\nShe was a recipient of the following foreign honors:\n\nIsabel's marriage with Gaston produced three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, who was named after her father, as the firstborn son of the heiress presumptive, was given the title of Prince of Grão Pará. Isabel's children were\n\n\n\n"}

WILPF has national sections in 37 countries.\n\nThe WILPF is headquartered in Geneva and maintains a United Nations office in New York City.\n\nWILPF developed out of the International Women's Congress against World War I that took place in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1915 and the formation of the International Women's Committee of Permanent Peace; the name WILPF was not chosen until 1919. The first WILPF president, Jane Addams, had previously founded the Woman's Peace Party in the United States, in January 1915, this group later became the US section of WILPF. Along with Jane Addams, Marian Cripps and Margaret E. Dungan were also founding members. The English Maude Royden remained vice president of the international WILPF . As of 1920 the US section of WILPF was headquartered in New York City. Marian Cripps, Baroness Parmoor, who later served as president of its British branch.\n\nFurthermore, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom is opposed to wars and international conflicts. The major movements of the league have been: open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, a statement on weapons and an international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, gender-based violence and women human rights defenders. \n\nA forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in Washington, D.C. at a meeting called by Jane Addams and Carrie Chapman Catt. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of neutral countries to offer continuous mediation as a way of ending war.\n\nWPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28–30, 1915.\n\nThe 1915 International Congress of Women was organized by the German feminist Anita Augspurg, Germany's first female jurist, and Lida Gustava Heymann (1868–1943) at the invitation of the Dutch pacifist, feminist and suffragist Aletta Jacobs to protest the war then raging in Europe, and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28, wound up on May 1, and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and belligerent nations, adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) with Jane Addams as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP.\n\nJane Addams met with President Woodrow Wilson and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in Zürich in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the peace treaty ending World War I as a scheme of revenge of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another world war. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. WILPF moved its headquarters to Geneva to be near the proposed site of the League of Nations, although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food blockades or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism. The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as \"unpatriotic\" during the First Red Scare. The WILPF supported treaties such as the Washington Naval Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Vera Brittain was the WILPF's Vice-President.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's Jewish community.\n\nAlthough WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including Bart de Ligt and J. D. Bernal.\n\nTwo WILPF leaders have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: Jane Addams, in 1931 and Emily Greene Balch in 1946.\n\nWILPF has had Consultative Status (category B) with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the democratization of the UN, the Security Council and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and General Assembly activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the privatisation and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council veto.\n\nWork areas\n\nBroad areas of concern are:\n\nThe Women in Peace and Security Programme, WIPSEN, or \"PeaceWomen\" was founded in 2000.

They were most famous for their work on television, most notably \"Fist of Fun\" and \"This Morning with Richard Not Judy\" but had been working together on stage and on radio since the late 1980s.\n\nAs with many double acts, Lee and Herring performed as contrasting personalities: one mature and duplicitous (Lee) and the other puerile and cheeky (Herring). As with several other double acts, Lee and Herring had a certain irony to their style and constantly checked themselves and made reference to this. The characters of Lee and Herring were parodies and exaggerations of their real life selves.\n\nLee and Herring first met at a party while they were studying at Oxford University. Lee had been performing stand-up on the circuit for a short while and had heard that Herring had been trying to as well, so he introduced himself. Lee once remarked that one of the reasons they decided to work as a double act was that they found the resemblance of the title \"Lee and Herring\" to Worcestershire sauce brand Lea & Perrins humorous.\n\nAt Oxford, Lee and Herring performed in a regular comedy revue called The Seven Raymonds, which also included the material and performance of Emma Kennedy, Michael Cosgrave and Tim Richardson.\n\nTogether they wrote material for Chris Morris' \"On The Hour\" (1991). However, a management conflict meant that the duo were not involved in the television version, \"The Day Today\", and that their material was edited out of the original official BBC audio releases of \"On The Hour\" (it was later re-instated in a 2009 CD release on Warp Records.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, they wrote and performed \"Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World\" for BBC Radio 4. For BBC Radio 1, they wrote and performed one series of \"Fist of Fun\" (1993), which later transferred to television and would pave the way for their mainstream success. \"Fist of Fun\" made several subtle references to their dislike for former colleague Patrick Marber. Lee and Herring fell out with the \"On The Hour\" team after a row over ownership of characters; Patrick Marber has claimed that he invented the character of news reporter Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan, while Lee and Herring also claim to have invented the character.\n\nAfter the radio version of \"Fist of Fun\", they presented another Radio 1 show running for 3 series, simply entitled \"Lee and Herring\" (but often referred to as \"Lee & Herring's Radio One Music Show\") which featured a mixture of records chosen by the duo themselves, and their comedy sketches and discussions.\n\nTheir final major work as a double-act was \"This Morning With Richard Not Judy\" (\"TMWRNJ\"), which aired on Sunday mornings on BBC Two for series in 1998 and 1999, and was famous for being increasingly risqué and original.\n\nLee and Herring went their separate ways at the end of the 1990s and have both enjoyed major fringe and mainstream fame. Stewart Lee retired from stand-up comedy in the early 2000s, a time in which he co-wrote \"Jerry Springer - The Opera\" and directed \"Attention Scum!\" for Simon Munnery. He made a comeback to stand-up in 2005, touring very successful shows, and has written and performed four series of his own BBC 2 television show \"Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle\".\n\nRichard Herring went on to write the sitcoms \"Time Gentlemen Please\" for Sky One with Al Murray, and \"You Can Choose Your Friends\" (which was loosely based on his own family) for ITV, and worked on the third series of \"Little Britain\" as script editor. Herring has written, performed and toured with a number of successful comedy shows including \"Christ on a Bike\", \"Hitler Moustache\" and \"We're All Going To Die\", building up an audience through the medium of podcasts which include \"Collings and Herrin\" with Andrew Collins and his interview show \"Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast\". 2013 is his 22nd year at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he has performed 10 different stand-up shows in as many years.\n\nLee and Herring occasionally reunite for one-off events. Recent collaborations include an interview together for \"The Guardian\" and a 2005 review of each other's work for the arts supplement of \"The Sunday Times\".\n\nThe pair performed a short set at London's Bloomsbury Theatre on 5 February 2007 as part of a tribute to stand-up comedian Ted Chippington.\n\nThey reunited for a 30-minute performance at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith on 16 November 2008, where they were joined at the end by a resurrected \"Curious Orange\".\n\nA brief reunion took place at the 2010 Edinburgh Fringe at Stewart Lee's \"Silver Stewbilee\" show in which Herring heckled him and ran on stage, berating him for his \"pretentious\" new book. Lee also \"appeared\" as a recorded voicemail message on \"The Collings and Herrin Podcast Live\" the following day.\n\nHerring interviewed Lee in June 2012 on his series \"Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast\". The filmed version of this encounter has both an individual release by indie company Go Faster Stripe, and acts as extra material on the Series Two \"Fist of Fun\" box set. Other podcast appearances between the two include \"Richard Herring's Edinburgh Fringe Podcast\" in August 2013 and again for the sixth season of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast in 2015.\n\nOn 2 June 2014, Lee and Herring briefly appeared on stage together when Lee introduced Herring's section at a British Humanist Association benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2161691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161691", "title": "Steve Beaton", "text": "Steve Beaton\n\nSteve Beaton (born 5 April 1964) is an English professional darts player for the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). He won the BDO World Darts Championship in 1996 and is a former World No. 1.\n\nBeaton was born in Coventry, Warwickshire, England.\n\nBeaton made his World Championship debut in 1992, at a time when the world darts championship was still a unified tournament. He lost in the first round to Chris Johns 1–3, but he was encouraged by his performance in the same tournament in 1993 when he achieved a huge upset win over the tournament favourite and former world champion Dennis Priestley, and he also beat another former world champion in Bob Anderson, before losing in the semi-final to Alan Warriner. He became a full-time professional later in 1993 at a time after the split, which saw the WDC players banned from all BDO tournaments – and Beaton went on to win the prestigious Winmau World Masters, beating Les Wallace in the final.\n\nAfter the WDC (now PDC) players were expelled from all BDO tournaments in April 1993, it left Beaton as the top seeded player for the 1994 and 1995 BDO world championships, but he lost in the first round both times, to Nick Gedney and Dave Askew respectively, both times losing 2–3 after leading 2–0. But in 1996, he finally delivered at the BDO world championships, beating Co Stompé, John Part, Martin Adams, Andy Fordham and then Richie Burnett in the final to clinch the BDO World Championship.\n\nWhen he defended his world title in 1997, Beaton was within the width of the Double 10 wire of reaching the final, but he lost to Marshall James in a tight semi-final match.\n\nBeaton won many Open titles during his career in BDO tournaments including the Dutch, Danish, Belgian and Swedish Opens.\n\nBeaton continued to play in the BDO version of the World Championship until 2001 (reaching the semi-final in 1997 and quarter-final in 1998), while also participating in some televised PDC events. When the PDC changed the eligibility rules for their televised tournaments from the start of 2002, Beaton decided to switch to playing in the PDC World Darts Championship.\n\nBeaton has never made the same impact in the PDC, having failed to reach the quarter-finals in any of his attempts at the world crown, his best finishes being three Round of 16 losses in 2002, 2004 and 2020. In 2002 the tournament was still only five rounds he got knocked out in round two by John Part 0–6. In 2004 when he got a bye to the third round and was knocked out in round four by Mark Dudbridge 1–4. His poor form has seen him slip down the world rankings but always maintained a position in the top 32. Beaton has however reached the semi-finals in four major PDC tournaments – the 2001 World Matchplay when he lost to Richie Burnett, the 2004 UK Open when he lost to Roland Scholten, the 2004 World Grand Prix when he lost to Alan Warriner, and the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts when he lost to Scott Waites. Prior to losing to Waites at the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, Beaton had rolled back the years in his quarter final match by coming from 11–14 behind to win five legs in a row and defeat the 3-time defending champion, Phil Taylor, 16–14.\n\nBeaton saw a rise in form in the 2009 season taking him even further up the rankings to 19th in the world. Beaton won his first title in almost nine years when he took the Players Championship in Nuland in October. He also finished runner up in the European championship beating the likes of Adrian Lewis, Mark Walsh and James Wade en route to the final where he was defeated 11–3 by Phil Taylor. This result however gave Beaton a place in the 2009 Grand Slam of Darts, where he progressed from the round robin stage courtesy of wins over Co Stompé and Kevin McDine before being comprehensively outplayed by Simon Whitlock.\n\nAs mentioned before, at the 2010 Grand Slam Of Darts, Beaton produced a major upset by beating three-time defending champion Phil Taylor 16–14 in the quarter-finals, having trailed 9–13 and 11–14. Earlier in the week, Beaton had needed to defeat Paul Nicholson 5–3 or better at the round robin stage to stay in the tournament (he won 5–1), and followed that up with a 10–6 win over Ted Hankey who had himself defeated Taylor in his group. Beaton was defeated by eventual champion Scott Waites 16–9 in the semi-final. Despite his good form in 2010 he was narrowly defeated in the first round of the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship by Mark Hylton eventually losing by 3 sets to 2. The following year, Beaton recovered from two sets and three match darts down against Magnus Caris to win 3–2, but was beaten by Simon Whitlock 1–4 in the second round.\n\nIn the rest of the major events in 2012, Beaton could not win more than one game in any of them with his best results being last 16 exits in the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix and Players Championship Finals. On the PDC Pro Tour he lost in the semi-finals of the second Players Championship in a deciding leg to Dave Chisnall and also reached two other quarter-finals.\n\nAt the 2013 World Championship Beaton defeated qualifier Kyle Anderson 3–0, but was then beaten 4–2 by James Wade. After the tournament he was ranked world number 28. He reached the quarter-finals of a PDC Pro Tour event for the first time in six months in April at the seventh UK Open Qualifier, but lost 6–3 to John Part. At the UK Open itself, he lost 9–5 to Joey Palfreyman in the third round. He lost in two consecutive semi-finals in European Tour events during the year. The first of these came at the Austrian Darts Open where he missed four match darts at double 16 against Mervyn King to be edged out 6–5. The other was at the German Darts Championship where he suffered a 6–4 defeat against Dave Chisnall. He then won the German Darts Masters as he dropped only four legs in his first four games before averaging 100 in a 6–3 victory over Simon Whitlock in the semi-finals. He played Mervyn King in the final and with Beaton leading 4–3, King incredibly burst his score when on 134 by hitting a treble 20 with his final dart instead of a single to leave 40. Beaton stepped in to hit a 160 finish and, though the match went to a deciding leg, he was first to a finish to close the match out 6–5 and seal his first title for almost four years. At the World Grand Prix he missed one dart for the match in the first round against James Wade to be narrowly beaten by two sets to one. Another semi-final followed at the 12th Players Championship by seeing off Gary Anderson in the quarters before losing 6–2 to Kim Huybrechts. His surge in form during the latter half of the year saw him finish eighth on the ProTour Order of Merit to qualify for the Players Championship Finals, where he came back from 3–1 and 5–3 down against Wade in the first round to win 6–5. However, he averaged 81.41 in his next match against Wes Newton (almost 20 points lower than against Wade) and was beaten 9–3.\n\nIn the first round of the 2014 World Championship Beaton missed four darts to move 2–0 up against Devon Petersen and was instead beaten 3–1. He lost 9–6 against Brendan Dolan in the third round of the UK Open. In June, Beaton won through to the final of the Gibraltar Darts Trophy, but he let a 4–1 lead turn into a 6–4 defeat against James Wade. He could not progress past the first round of the 2014 World Matchplay, the 2014 World Grand Prix, the 2014 European Championship or the 2014 Players Championship Finals.\n\nIn an exact reverse of their 2013 clash, Beaton was knocked out 3–0 by Kyle Anderson in the first round of the 2015 World Championship. He lost 9–5 to Peter Wright in the third round of the 2015 UK Open and the first round of both the 2015 World Matchplay (10–4 to Gary Anderson) and the 2015 World Grand Prix (2–1 in sets to Justin Pipe). Despite only winning one of his three group fixtures, Beaton qualified for the knockout stage of the Grand Slam on leg difference. He averaged almost 100 in the second round, but only had five attempts at a double as Michael van Gerwen averaged 109 in defeating Beaton 10–2.\n\nBeaton lost 4–2 to Michael Smith in the second round of the 2016 World Championship. He played in his first final since 2014 at the sixth UK Open Qualifier and was beaten 6–2 by Van Gerwen. He also made the final of the 10th Players Championship event, but lost 6–2 to Dave Chisnall. Beaton got to the quarter-finals of the 2016 World Matchplay, which was his best performance since 2001, by defeating Jelle Klaasen 10–6 and Smith 11–7. He lost 16–13 to Gary Anderson after fighting back from 9–4 down to level the match at 12–12 before eventually succumbing to the two-time reigning world champion. After Beaton took the opening set with a 135 finish in the first round of the World Grand Prix, Van Gerwen won six unanswered legs to win 2–1. He lost 6–4 to Jeffrey de Graaf in the first round of the Players Championship Finals.\n\nBeaton failed to progress to the third round at the World Championship for the 12th year in a row when he was beaten 4–1 by James Wade in the second round of the 2017 event. In 2017 Beaton won the 13th players championship event of the year defeating Gary Anderson 6–3 in the final. In the Players Championship Finals Beaton reached the quarter final by winning against Ronny Huybrechts, Jelle Klaasen and Jermaine Wattimena. In the quarter final he lost 8–10 to Jonny Clayton.\n\nIn the 2018 World Championship Beaton won 3–1 in the first round against William O'Connor but was eliminated in the second round 0–4 by Vincent van der Voort.\n\nBeaton is currently introduced in the PDC as The Bronzed Adonis, a nickname derived from his tanned appearance. His appearance is maintained twelve months a year via his warm weather training camps in Playa de las Americas, Tenerife. His entrance music is \"Stayin' Alive\" by The Bee Gees. Most recently, Beaton has taken part in a number of marathons in order to keep fit and raise money for charity, and Beaton has been referred to as The Marathon Man as a result. Beaton was once also nicknamed Magnum P.I. due to his likeness of the actor Tom Selleck, who played the title role in the TV series.\n\nBeaton currently resides in North Walsham, Norfolk, where he lives with his wife Nanette, whom he married in 1993.

{"id": "2161705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161705", "title": "Milton Malsor", "text": "Milton Malsor\n\nMilton Malsor is a village and civil parish in South Northamptonshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 761. It is south of Northampton town centre, south-east of Birmingham, and north of central London; junction 15 of the M1 motorway is east by road. The area of the Milton Malsor civil parish is about , stretching from north of the M1 motorway between junctions 15 and 15A, south to the West Coast Main Line, east to the A508 and A45 roads, and west to the A43 road.\n\nThe village's name is from the Old English \"middel\" for \"Middle\" and \"tun\" meaning farm or settlement and the second part of the name appears to be from \"Malsoures\", the name of a prominent local family added much later. The first recorded mention of the village is in the days of William the Conqueror and the Domesday Book. This records that there were two manors and two men held lands at Milton as part of their Baronies. These were William Peverel and Goisfrid Alselin.\n\nThe village has a Parish Council with nine members elected every four years (last election 2015). The parish council area extends to include the M1 in the north between junctions 15 and 15a; to the east the A508 Northampton to Milton Keynes main road and A45 towards Huntingdon and Peterborough; to the south part of the West Coast Main Line and to the west the A43 Northampton-Oxford trunk road. The local district council is that of South Northamptonshire where Milton is in Harpole and Grange ward together with the villages of Gayton, Rothersthorpe, Harpole and Kislingbury which elects two members. The parish is in the Northamptonshire County Council division of Bugbrooke (from May 2013) with just over 10,000 electors and has one member, (currently Conservative).\n\nThe Member of Parliament from 2010 is Mr Chris Heaton-Harris, Conservative, for the Daventry Parliamentary Constituency. Prior to the 2010 General Election the village was in Northampton South Parliamentary Constituency. Initially the Boundary Commission wanted to move the village into the new parliamentary constituency of South Northamptonshire. However, as this was inconvenient for election administration purposes, the Boundary Commission put Milton with fellow ward villages in South Northants Council's \"Harpole and Grange\" ward into the Daventry Constituency previously held by Mr Tim Boswell who stood down at 2010 General Election.\n\nMany fields around the village reflect England's history. The field known as 'the Leys' \"(opposite Milton House in Rectory Lane)\" shows clear signs of 18th-century pre-enclosure and pre-British Agricultural Revolution farming in strips although this is slowly disappearing with recent farming. The mediaeval open field system was enclosed in Milton in 1779 together with that of Collingtree. The soil is predominantly sandy as one might expect since the area is the bed of an ancient river. Evidence of sand and clay extraction is all around, reflecting 19th- and 20th-century industrial and urban expansion. For example, the small industrial estate in Gayton Road is on an old clay quarry; the playing and football fields in Collingtree Road are on the sites of sand quarries - in the latter case mostly filled with clay spoil from the 1950s construction of the M1. The field between Towcester Road and the A43 Milton by-pass, which opened in May 1991, to the west of the village was also the site of a sand quarry in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1965 the driver of a mechanical digger spotted a shiny object in a newly exposed face. It turned out to be an early Bronze Age Cinerary Urn. The field between the village and the M1 on the north side of Collingtree Road is an area designated by Northamptonshire County Council for sand extraction. The sand is stated by the county council to be of the 'soft sand' type suitable for mortar. The site is in Milton Malsor parish and only ca.200m from houses in the village. It was originally called the \"Collingtree site\" but the county council finally referred to it as the Milton site in late 2008. It has so far not been developed probably due to its triangular shape and stranded location between the motorway along one edge, the railway line another and a road unsuited to heavy lorries on the third. The site is included in the county council's mineral's and waste plan, the subject of a Public Inquiry in 2009. A third Public Inquiry in 2010 retained the site.\n\nA stream runs northwest through the village, partly in a conduit but visible from Collingtree Road and Rectory Lane as it flows north through the field known as 'The Dip' after an old sheep dip the remains of which are still visible. In Spring 1998 this flooded, causing minor damage to some houses. The stream flows north joining with others from the east and south flowing south and west around Hunsbury Hill. It then joins the River Nene at Upton, west of Northampton. The Grand Union Canal and its Northampton arm, built in 1815 passes nearby. There is a marina just off the road to Gayton. There are 17 locks on the arm, taking the canal downhill into Northampton and to join the River Nene east of the town. It takes about two hours for a boat to travel through.\n\nThe United Kingdom Census 2011 showed there were 761 (2001: 713) people living in the village, 359 male (2001: 344), 402 female (2001: 369), with average age 41.1 years (2001: 45.21). There were 311 dwellings (2001: 302). The surrounding South Northamptonshire district is rural and sparsely populated with just over 80,000 people in 2000.\n\nNew development within the village boundary is restricted to infill development only. A new housing development of 14 houses was completed in Chestnut Close in 2008. A smaller ones of 6 dwellings was begun in 2010 for the derelict Home Farm site off Malzor Lane and one or two others elsewhere. In 2010 a proposal for 25 houses for a site off Stockwell Way was opposed by the parish council and refused by the district council as it was outside the village boundary and contrary to district council adopted policy. Planning details can be accessed via the parish council website. Possible urban extensions to Northampton were proposed in 2007 by the West Northamptonshire Joint Planning Unit, a group formed by Northampton Borough Council, South Northamptonshire District Council and Daventry District Council. These proposals included extensions on land in the parish between the M1 motorway, north of the village, A43 by-pass (west), A508 trunk road (east) and the West Coast main railway line to the south. A parkway station south the village was also mentioned but train operators do not want further stops on the line between London and Rugby via Northampton. Possible expansion of Northampton south of the M1 affecting the village were excluded from draft proposals published for consultation in July 2009.\n\nThere are two pubs: \"The Greyhound\" in Towcester Road, which has a large restaurant, and \"The Compass\" in Green Street, a more traditional village pub also offering bar food. The Greyhound is adjacent to the Village Hall and attracts large crowds from Northampton's southern suburbs in summer as it has a large garden area. Both establishments serve good quality real ale with periodic guest bitters.\n\nMilton Malsor has a retirement care home for the elderly in Green Street called Holly House. Sheltered housing for older people in the form of 26 flats and bungalows is also provided in the village by South Northants Homes Ltd. The area is centred around Raynsford House which offers a lounge, dining room, laundry, guest facilities and a community alarm service for sheltered housing residents.\n\nA shop and former post office and the modern village hall, refurbished in 2008, are both in the High Street opposite the green and War Memorial. The Northampton Hilton Hotel is approximately 1½ miles distant on Watering Lane in the neighbouring village of Collingtree, just off the A45 trunk road. There are several other hotels in the area along the A45 trunk road.\n\nThe village has two small industrial estates; the larger on Gayton Road is adjacent, but with no access, to the A43. This is referred to locally as 'Gallifords' reflecting its ownership. The smaller is adjacent to the M1 bridge along Collingtree Road and known as 'Maple Court' alluding to its history. There is an architect's office in the old Rectory and additional modern offices on Towcester Road in the converted Hope Brewery and out buildings.\n\nA mobile library visits the village every two weeks; the nearest local library is at Hunsbury, about a mile north, next to a large Tesco 'Extra' supermarket and petrol station.\n\nThere are three working farms in the parish including a free-range egg farm.\n\nMuch of the village is in a conservation area which is shown on a map on the Parish Council website and has many traditional Northamptonshire stone cottages, a large number of which have thatched or pantiled roofs. There are over 30 listed buildings in the village, most in the conservation area. Particular buildings of note, mostly listed by their street locations, are as follows:\n\nThe county of Northants is at a north-south and east-west rail, motorway and fast road transport network. The Northampton Loop of the West Coast Main Line carries trains from Northampton to London Euston and runs through the parish just east of the village, with the main line about a mile south. The nearest convenient stations are at Northampton (4 miles north), Milton Keynes Central (14 miles south) and also Wellingborough (12 miles east) on the Midland Main Line with links to Sheffield, Leicester and London St Pancras.\n\nTypical travel times in minutes by road \"(peak times in italics)\" are: central London 75 \"(110)\", Birmingham 45 \"(60)\", Manchester 120 \"(175)\", Leicester 50 \"(65)\", Oxford 50 \"(60)\", Cambridge 85 \"(130)\", Milton Keynes 20 \"(30)\". Travel times (peak) by rail (from April 2008) by West Midlands Trains - as well as Avanti West Coast services in minutes are: from Northampton to Central London (Euston) 55, to Birmingham 65; from Milton Keynes to Central London 40 and Manchester 120. Airports at Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted as well as Birmingham Airport, Luton and East Midlands are all within easy reach. The village has bus services to Northampton, Towcester and Milton Keynes, though this is poor on Sundays and weekday evenings.\n\nOn 18 April 1967 at about 2.31pm, a wagon on a goods train of 69 empty mineral wagons, travelling on the down line to Northampton, derailed just south of the village. The train travelled a further 1½ miles before more wagons derailed, a little distance north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the up line from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70 mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery.\n\nThe inspector's report on the incident states that \"\"...assistance was given by the residents of the nearby village of Milton Malsor and I am informed that members of the Women's Institute of this village were quick to organise refreshment for those involved in the accident and their rescuers\"\". The Inspector concluded that the accident resulted from a broken spring on the goods train.\n\nA similar accident occurred on 31 December 1969 but about a mile further south near the northern end of Roade Cutting; on this occasion, the driver of the passenger train involved was killed.\n\nMilton Parochial Primary School in Green Street had 110 pupils in 2007, a large proportion of which were from the southern area of Northampton such as Hunsbury. The most recent Ofsted inspection, published 4 November 2010 stated: \"This is a good school. The pupils make good progress and achieve well because the teaching is effective\". Crazy 4 Kids After School and Holiday Club is privately owned located in the grounds of the Primary School. Children have access to the school hall, adjoining quiet room and a secure outdoor play area. The club is open each weekday from 3:30pm to 6pm and from 8am to 6pm during the school holidays. The most recent Ofsted report on the club states that: \"Overall the quality of the provision is good\". The village is in the catchment area of Campion Secondary School at Bugbrooke, about away by road with the children bussed daily.\n\nThere is a church, dedicated to the Holy Cross in Collingtree Road which has its own parochial church council and is part of the Church of England's Peterborough Diocese. Prior to 2009, the church was part of the \"Three Parishes Group\" together with the churches of the nearby villages of Collingtree and Courteenhall. Since 2010 it has been re-grouped with four other parishes including Blisworth and Stoke Bruerne. There is also a Baptist Chapel in Green Street. A joint church newsletter is delivered roughly monthly.\n\nThe village has an active number of social and other groups including a Women's Institute which meets monthly; a village football club, Milton FC with its own village team and a reserve team which takes an active part in the Travis Perkins Northamptonshire Combination; indoor bowls and badminton groups both meet regularly in the village hall; village historical society with regular meetings about local matters of esoteric and general interest; an art club meets at the village hall during school term time. The village has a Scouts group, 1st Collingtree and Milton Malsor Scouts, and Brownies group which meet at the village hall during school term time.\n\n\n"}

He also writes about it in one of his books, \"Math Hysteria: Fun Games With Mathematics\".\n\"The above definition is the one given by Ian Stewart and by MathWorld.

Given these three roots, the Padovan sequence can be expressed by a formula involving \"p\", \"q\" and \"r\":\n\nwhere \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" are constants.\n\nSince the magnitudes of the complex roots \"q\" and \"r\" are both less than 1 (and hence \"p\" is a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number), the powers of these roots approach 0 for large \"n\", and formula_23 tends to zero.\nFor all formula_24, P(n) is the integer closest to formula_25, \nwhere \"s\" = \"p\"/\"a\" = 1.0453567932525329623... is the only real root of \"s\" − 2\"s\" + 23\"s\" − 23 = 0. The ratio of successive terms in the Padovan sequence approaches \"p\", which has a value of approximately 1.324718. This constant bears the same relationship to the Padovan sequence and the Perrin sequence as the golden ratio does to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe generating function of the Padovan sequence is\n\nThis can be used to prove identities involving products of the Padovan sequence with geometric terms, such as:\n\nIn a similar way to the Fibonacci numbers that can be generalized to a set of polynomials\ncalled the Fibonacci polynomials, the Padovan sequence numbers can be generalized to\nyield the Padovan polynomials.\n\nIf we define the following simple grammar:\n\nthen this Lindenmayer system or L-system produces the following sequence of strings:\n\nand if we count the length of each string, we obtain the Padovan sequence of numbers:\n\nAlso, if you count the number of \"A\"s, \"B\"s and \"C\"s in each string, then for the \"n\"th\nstring, you have \"P\"(\"n\" − 5) \"A\"s, \"P\"(\"n\" − 3) \"B\"s and \"P\"(\"n\" − 4) \"C\"s. The count of \"BB\" pairs, \"AA\" pairs\nand \"CC\" pairs are also Padovan numbers.\n\nA spiral can be formed based on connecting the corners of a set of 3-dimensional cuboids.\nThis is the Padovan cuboid spiral.

Meru\" observed certain diagonals in Pascal's triangle (see diagram) and drew them on paper in 1993. The Padovan numbers were discovered in 1994.

The tables which he drew up from information obtained from all the presbyteries of Scotland were based on a system of actuarial calculation that supplied a precedent followed by insurance companies in modern times for reckoning averages of longevity.\n\nWebster published in 1748 his \"Calculations\", setting forth the principles on which his scheme for widows' pensions was based; he also wrote a defence of the Methodist movement in 1742, and \"Zeal for the Civil and Religious Interests of Mankind Commended\" (1754).\n\nIn 1755 the government commissioned Webster to obtain data for the first census of Scotland, which he carried out in the same year.

Published from September 1980 through August 1984, it featured articles about hardware and software associated with the Apple II platform and the people and companies who made them. The name was originally used on a newsletter of Apple Software pioneer company, Softape, who in 1980 changed its name to Artsci Inc.\n\nThe startup capital for \"Softalk\" came from Margot Comstock, who had won on the television game show \"Password,\" along with a generous contribution after a few months from John Haller and from Comstock and Al Tommervik's second mortgage on their house. Partners William V R Smith III, William Depew contributed early office space in their Softape storeroom and arrived unexpectedly with office desks when Softalk moved into its own location.\n\nUnlike other computer magazines that generally focused on a specific, narrow subject matter or market segment (e.g., business applications, games, or professional programming), \"Softalk\" gave broad coverage to all parts of the Apple world of the time, from programming tips to game playing, from business to home use, including computing as an industry, a hobby, a tool, a toy, and a culture. On occasion it even ran fiction. \n\nAnother characteristic of the magazine was a playful, insider-like voice. The experts in those early days chatted in their own relaxed language about the techniques and elements of their world. Bert Kersey, Beagle Bros, was one columnist; as were Doug Carlston, co-founder of Brøderbund software; Mark Pelczarski, founder of Penguin Software; Bill Budge, creator of \"Pinball Construction Set\"; and Bill Depew, creator of \"Apple 21\" and \"Magic Window\".\n\nA regular feature was a monthly chart of the most popular software in various categories, which was the Apple community's equivalent of the \"Billboard\" charts for pop music. Unlike most such bestseller lists, which report shipment from warehouses, not sales, \"Softalk\"'s bestseller numbers were drawn from polling retail sales in computer stores throughout the world. There were also contests encouraging the participation of readers. Originally, \"Softalk\" was sent free to all registered Apple owners, but later it required paid subscription after one free year. Softalk underwent rapid expansion in its early history, with issues getting very thick (largely from advertising), but an industry slump in 1984 caught \"Softalk\" with too much unrealized revenues against heavy printing costs, which overtaxed its undercapitalized status. Rather than take the desperate path of erratic publication, the \"Softalk\" board chose to cease publication. In its 48 influential months, the original \"Softalk\" readership grew from 30,000 names loaned by Apple Computer Inc. to 250,000 readers. In its third and fourth years, \"Softalk\" achieved a place on the Folio 400 list of the nation's largest magazines.\n\nWhen the IBM PC came on the market, Softalk Publishing started \"'Softalk for the IBM PC.\"' And with the advent of the Macintosh, Softalk Publishing launched \"Softalk Mac\", written as \"ST. Mac\". For a few years Softalk Publishing published a magazine begun by On-Line Systems: \"Softline,\" renamed to \"ST. Game\" for its final issue.\n\nThe disk magazine \"Softdisk\" was originally partly owned by \"Softalk\", and survived on its own.\n"}

As a member of the Yankees, he was part of two World Series championship teams, both wins over the Los Angeles Dodgers, in and . \"Mick The Quick\" was generally known as a speedy leadoff hitter who made contact and was an excellent center fielder, with a below-average throwing arm.\n\nThe legend of \"Mick the Quick\" began during his amateur days at Miami Dade Community College. A fast and athletic outfielder, Rivers emerged as one of the team stars, but once disappeared just moments before the start of a game. His teammates and coaches later discovered Rivers asleep under a nearby tree.\n\nOriginally signed by the Atlanta Braves, Rivers began his big league career in 1970 with the Angels, playing center field and third base. He stayed with them through the 1975 season. Rivers played part-time in his first few years, until becoming the starter in 1974. He led the American League in triples both years and stole a career-high 70 bases in 1975, tops in the league.\n\nRivers was acquired along with Ed Figueroa by the Yankees from the Angels for Bobby Bonds on December 11, 1975, a trade that immediately paid dividends for the Yankees. Figueroa won 19 games and Rivers enjoyed a career year. Rivers was named to the All-Star team, batted .312, stole 43 bases and posted then-career highs in home runs (8) and runs batted in (67). Rivers placed third in the Most Valuable Player voting behind teammate Thurman Munson and George Brett and was named an outfielder on \"The Sporting News\" AL All-Star team.\n\nRivers posted good numbers in his two other full Yankee seasons, including a .326 batting average in 1977, but was traded in the middle of the 1979 season to Texas. He set the single-season record for hits by a Ranger with 210 in 1980. He concluded his career in 1984 with a .295 lifetime average, 267 stolen bases and 1,660 hits. Rivers posted a .308 average in his 29 postseason games.\n\nWhile Rivers played for them, the Yankees won the World Series in 1977 and 1978, both times against the Los Angeles Dodgers. They won the 1976 pennant, but lost in the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nOn September 30, 1984, in Rivers final major league game, he and the Rangers were the victims of the Angel's Mike Witt's perfect game, Witt winning 1-0.\n\nBill James ranked Mickey Rivers as the 59th greatest center fielder of all time. His stooped shuffle as he ambled to the plate masked quick speed out of the box on bunts and sustained speed around the bases.\n\nRivers was honored with many of his teammates from the 1977 World Series champion New York Yankees in the Yankee Old Timers Game in 2007. In \"The Bronx Is Burning\", the ESPN miniseries based on the 1977 Yankees, he was portrayed by Leonard Robinson and portrayed as experiencing financial problems. When Reggie Jackson remarked to a reporter that he had an IQ of 160, Rivers responded, \"Out of what, a thousand?\". Rivers' tenure in the Bronx produced other classic quotes, such as when he tried to explain the bizarre dynamics of the Yankees, who featured controversial owner George Steinbrenner and contentious manager Billy Martin. \"Me and George and Billy,\" Rivers said, \"we’re two of a kind.\" According to Goose Gossage, when the newly acquired reliever went through a rough stretch of blown saves, Rivers once jumped on top of the bullpen car to prevent Gossage from entering the game. \n\nAfter baseball, Rivers began training racehorses in his native Florida.

He was almost six years old when his father died in France of influenza during the great epidemic while serving with the United States Army during World War I. Following his mother's remarriage to British agronomist Leonard K. Elmhirst (1893–1974) in 1925, the family moved to England. They lived at Dartington Hall where he attended the progressive school founded by his parents. His education was completed at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nWhile still an undergraduate at Cambridge, he became a well known Grand Prix motor racing driver and competed at events in the UK and Europe. He competed in more Grands Prix than any American until after World War II. Straight started competing in 1931 with a Brooklands Riley competing at Shelsley Walsh, Southport and Brooklands circuit.\n\nIn 1933, driving a black and silver Maserati, he won the Mountain Championship at Brooklands, the Mont Ventoux Hill Climb (3 September) and the Brighton Speed Trials (16 September). He also won the 1100 c.c. class in the Coppa Acerbo, held at Pescara, Italy, driving an M.G. Magnette. In 1934 he formed his own motor racing team, personally driving to victory in the South African Grand Prix, held on the 16-mile Buffalo circuit in East London. He also gave public demonstrations at Brooklands Racing Circuit achieving a speed of 138.7 mph, a record for 5 litre class cars.\n\nFlying was also another of his passion. At age 16, though still too young for a pilot's licence, he had already accumulated over 60 hours solo flight. In his early 20s, as head of the Straight Corporation Limited, he operated airlines and airfields throughout Britain and ran flying clubs. He commissioned an advanced light aircraft, the Hendy Heck, and in 1936 he helped develop the Miles Whitney Straight aircraft, the same year he became a naturalised British citizen. On 18 October 1938, the Straight Corporation purchased control of Norman Edgar (Western Airways) Ltd. and renamed it Western Airways Ltd. His commercial airline business in the later 1930s was reputed to be carrying more passengers than Imperial Airways, on short routes within the UK, flying de Havilland Dragon Rapides.\n\nDuring World War II, Whitney Straight served as a Royal Air Force pilot. He was sent to Norway in April 1940 to find frozen lakes suitable for use as airfields. Lake Lesjaskog was utilised by 263 Squadron during the Norwegian Campaign as a result. \nStraight was seriously wounded during a German bombing raid in Norway.\n\nFor his service in Norway, he was awarded the Norwegian War Cross with sword in 1942.\n\nAfter convalescing, he next served with No. 601 Squadron RAF in the Battle of Britain. From September 1940 until April 1941, he was credited with two aircraft destroyed. He then became commanding officer of 242 Squadron, bringing his total to 3 and 1 shared ( with 2 'probables') by late July 1941. Early in 1941 he was awarded a Military Cross for his work in Norway.\n\nHe was shot down by flak over France on 31 July 1941 and initially evaded capture. Through the French Underground, he made his way to unoccupied Vichy France where he was captured and put in a POW camp. However he escaped on 22 June 1942 and with the aid of the French Resistance reached safety in Gibraltar.\nIn September 1942, now as an Air Commodore, he was sent to the Middle East joining HQ, No. 216 Group, as AOC.\n\nAt war's end, he returned to the UK becoming AOC, 46 Group in June 1945. He was released from the RAF in late 1945, and he became chairman of the Royal Aero Club. With the establishment of the British European Airways corporation in 1946, Straight was its deputy chairman. In July 1947, he became managing director and Chief Executive Officer of British Overseas Airways Corporation. In 1949, was appointed deputy chairman of the board. In the United States his cousin, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney (1899–1992), was the President of Aviation Corporation of America, which became Pan American Airways.\nAround this time he was also on the board of Rolls-Royce and he discovered that in 1947 Rolls-Royce had sold 55 jet engines to the Soviet Union, the sale being approved by the post-war Labour government of Clement Attlee. The Russians had copied the technology to produce their own version of the jet engine and were powering the MiG fighters using Rolls-Royce technology. He decided to sue the Russian government for copyright infringement. The figure claimed was £207 million which he never received.\n\nIn 1967, he donated the Whitney Straight Award to the Royal Aeronautical Society to recognise the achievement and status of women in aviation. The award consisted of a cheque and a sculpture by Barbara Hepworth. It was won by Anne Burns in 1967 and Peggy Hodges in 1970.\n\nOn July 17, 1935 he married Lady Daphne Margarita Finch-Hatton (1913–2003), the daughter of Guy Finch-Hatton, the 14th Earl of Winchilsea (1885–1939) and Margaretta Armstrong Drexel, the Countess Winchilsea (1885–1952). Lady Daphne's paternal uncle was Denys Finch Hatton (1887–1931), a famous pilot who was involved with Beryl Markham (1902–1986), another British pilot. Lady Daphne was half-American as her mother, Margaretta, was the daughter of Anthony Joseph Drexel, Jr. (1864–1934) and the granddaughter of Anthony Joseph Drexel (1826–1893), all from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Lady Daphne's maternal uncles included, Anthony J. Drexel II, who married Marjorie Gould, daughter of George Jay Gould, and John Armstrong Drexel (1891-1958), who was also an aviation pioneer. Together, Whitney and Lady Daphne had two daughters:\n\nWhile Straight was married to Lady Daphne, he had an affair with noted aviator Diana Barnato Walker, MBE (1918–2008), the first British woman to break the sound barrier. Diana was the daughter of Woolf Barnato (1895-1948), another famous racing driver, and the widow of Wing Commander Derek Ronald Walker, RAF, who was killed on 14 November 1945 in bad weather while flying. Together, Whitney and Diana had a son:\n\nStraight died in Fulham in 1979 at the age of 66. Lady Daphne died at her home in London on June 3, 2003, and Walker died on April 28, 2008, aged 90.\n\n\n"}

It is northwest of Alton and north of Bentworth, just off the A339 road. The parish covers an area of and has an average elevation of above sea level. The nearest railway station is Alton, southeast of the village. Lasham formerly had its own railway station, Bentworth and Lasham, on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway until the line's closure in 1936. According to the 2011 census, the village had a population of 176.\n\nThe village name has been spelled in various ways, including Esseham (11th century), Lessham (12th century), and Lesseham or Lassham (14th century). Lasham was first mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 by William I (the conqueror) as an alod, and was then assessed at two and a half hides.\n\nThe Royal Navy used the village name for a Ham class minesweeper, HMS Lasham, which was operational from 1954 to 1981.\n\nLasham Airfield was constructed in 1942 on high ground north of the village. An avenue of beech trees that was originally planted by George Jervoise in 1809 was partially cut down to make way for the north side of the airfield, and the road running east–west just north of the airfield is still called \"Avenue Road\".\n\nThe Basingstoke–Alton road used to pass through Lasham village but as the land to the north was needed for the west end of the main runway, the road between the Avenue and Lasham village was diverted to the west on lower ground and now by-passes the village, passing between Lasham and Bentworth just west of the old railway station. This road was made of large concrete \"sets\" and was built by Italian prisoners of war who were housed in a camp at Thedden Grange southwest of Bentworth.\n\nThe airfield is now a major centre for the sport of gliding and is owned by Lasham Gliding Society, which bought the land from the Ministry of Defence. The airfield is also used by a company called ATC Lasham Ltd, which services airliners, mainly made by Boeing, in hangars on the south side of the main runway.\n\nThis is a small group of business units on the road running north east from the church to Avenue Road, just outside the houses of the village proper.\n\nThe church of St Mary, Lasham (CofE), was constructed in 1866 on the site of an older church, some of which went back to Saxon times.\n\nThe current Lasham parish boundary is Avenue Road to the north, the A339 to the west and south (except for a small extension west to Spain Lane towards Burkham, and a line to the east between Lasham and Shalden.\n\nPreviously, for some 200 years, Lasham was part of the Herriard Park estate (which still exists today to the north of the parish). The villages of Herriard and Lasham used to have the same rector, the rectory being in Lasham. Today Lasham is part of a larger CofE benefice which includes the villages of Bentworth, Lasham, Medstead and Shalden, the Rector living in Medstead.\n\nAvenue Road. An avenue of beech trees was planted in 1809 by George Purefoy Jervoise MP, to commemorate the golden jubilee of King George III in 1810. The original avenue was one mile long but in 1942 when Lasham Airfield was constructed, some of the avenue was cut down. When the plans became known, Sir George Jeffreys MP wrote a letter of objection which was published in the London Times newspaper on 7 October 1941. The Jervoise family continue to own the land to the north of the airfield today.\n\nThe village was formerly served by the Bentworth and Lasham railway station on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway, until its closure to passenger traffic in 1932.\n\nToday, the A339 Alton-Basingstoke road runs to the west of the village and the B3349 Alton-Odiham road to the east. Avenue Road, mentioned above and running on the north side of Lasham Airfield, connects the A339 to the B3349 at the Golden Pot public house at the top of the hill between Alton and Odiham. \n\n"}

Pepper cultivars of \"C. frutescens\" can be annual or short-lived perennial plants. Flowers are white with a greenish white or greenish yellow corolla, and are either insect- or self-pollinated. The plants' berries typically grow erect; ellipsoid-conical to lanceoloid shaped. They are usually very small and pungent, growing long and in diameter. Fruit typically grows a pale yellow and matures to a bright red, but can also be other colors. \"C. frutescens\" has a smaller variety of shapes compared to other \"Capsicum\" species. \"C. frutescens\" has been bred to produce ornamental strains, because of its large quantities of erect peppers growing in colorful ripening patterns.\n\n\"Capsicum frutescens\" includes the following cultivars and/or varieties:\n\n\nThe \"Capsicum frutescens\" species likely originated in South or Central America. It spread quickly throughout the tropical and subtropical regions in this area and still grows wild today. \"Capsicum frutescens\" is native to Central America and Northern and Western South America. \"C. frutescens\" may be related to \"C. chinense\".\n\nAccording to Richard Pankhurst, \"C. frutescens\" (known as \"barbaré\") was so important to the national cuisine of Ethiopia, at least as early as the 19th century, \"that it was cultivated extensively in the warmer areas wherever the soil was suitable.\" Although it was grown in every province, \"barbaré\" was especially extensive in Yejju, \"which supplied much of Showa as well as other neighboring provinces\". He singles out the upper Golima river valley as being almost entirely devoted to the cultivation of this plant, where thousands of acres were devoted to the plant and it was harvested year round.\n\nThis pepper is common in eastern and southern India where it grows readily in a favorable climate. It is known locally by common names such as dhan mirch or lovongi mirchi (Hindi), menasu (Kannada), milagay (Tamil), golkonda mirapa, konda mirapa, aggi mirapa (Telugu), dhanua lanka (Oria), kaantharimulaku, palmulaku, or vellakanthari (Malayalam).\n\n\"Helicoverpa assulta\" is one of very few insects that can successfully feed on the red pepper because it can tolerate capsicum.\n\n"}

Lee\" sailed for her homeport at 0830, 8 September, in company with most of DesRon 11 under Captain E. H. Watson in leading the way. Engaged in a high-speed engineering run down the Pacific Coast, the squadron changed course 95° at 2100 as inaccurate navigation indicated it appropriate to make the approach to Santa Barbara Channel. At 2105, \"Delphy\" stranded on the rocks of Point Pedernales, known to sailors as Honda, or the Devil's Jaw; though warning signals were sent up by the flagship, the sheltering configuration of the coast line prevented their recognition by the remaining ships of DesRon 11; and, in the ensuing confusion, six other destroyers including \"S. P. Lee\" ran aground also in what is known as the Honda Point Disaster.\n\nValiant efforts by the crew to save the ship proved futile, and the ship was abandoned the following day and declared a total loss. \"S. P. Lee\" and her sister destroyers were struck from the Navy list on 20 November. Her wreckage was sold on 19 October 1925 to Robert J. Smith of Oakland, California. He removed some of the destroyer's equipment but was unable to salvage her.\n\nSee for other ships of this name.\n\n \n"}

He is a member of English pop-group Take That and a judge on the German reality talent show \"Got to Dance\".\n\nDonald was educated at Littlemoss High School in Droylsden and worked as a vehicle painter. As a teenager he was interested in dancing and frequented the burgeoning breakdancing circuit in the Greater Manchester area, where he would first come into contact with future bandmate Jason Orange. He auditioned for Nigel Martin-Smith's new boy band project at his office in Manchester and was selected. The group was eventually named Take That.\n\nNigel Martin-Smith recruited Donald, along with Gary Barlow, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams to form a British boyband, Take That. The band enjoyed seven years of success until Robbie Williams left in 1995, leaving them to carry on as a quartet. Along with Orange, Donald featured less on lead vocals than Barlow, Owen and Williams during the band's first era, however did sing lead vocal on the single \"Never Forget\", which reached No. 1 in the UK in 1995.\n\nWhen Take That split in February 1996, Donald went solo and recorded a single \"Speak Without Words\" that is still unreleased to-date. When his solo career failed to take off, he returned to DJing.\n\nIn early 1996, Donald's bandmates Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Jason Orange came to the difficult decision that Take That was to split. They told Donald, who was not happy, but went along with their decision. In the 2006 documentary, \"Take That for the Record\", Donald shocked bandmates with his confession of being unstable enough to have the intention of committing suicide by drowning himself in the River Thames, not long after the split.\n\nIn 2005 Take That reunited for what was intended to be \"one last tour\" in the summer of 2006, following the release of their Greatest Hits album.\n\nIn late 2006, Take That reformed and released their first studio album since 1995, \"Beautiful World\" and from it they recorded two number ones in \"Patience\" and \"Shine\".\n\"Beautiful World\" featured Donald on lead vocals on two tracks; \"Beautiful World\" and \"Mancunian Way\". The song \"Mancunian Way\" is a tribute to the band's hometown of Manchester.\n\nOn Take That album \"The Circus\", Donald sings lead on two tracks, \"What is Love\" and \"Here\". He also shares lead vocals with the rest of the band on the album's opening track, \"The Garden\".\n\nOn the Take That LP called \"Progress\", Howard Donald sings lead vocals on a track called Affirmation. He also plays drums on several songs on \"Progress\" album and has mixed a B-side track for the second single \"Kidz\" called \"Revenge of the Kidz\".\n\nOn the latest Take That album \"Wonderland\" Donald sings lead vocals on \"Every Revolution\".\n\n\n\n• \"Speak Without Words\" (unreleased, 1996)\n\nDonald is one of the judges on a dancing show \"Got to Dance\" in Germany.\n\nDuring the Beautiful World Tour in 2007, Donald suffered a collapsed lung after performing a series of gymnastic stunts on stage, and was kept on a hospital ward for the two days, while the rest of the band performed as a threesome. However, Donald recovered quickly enough to reunite with the band in the final leg of the tour.\n\nDonald was educated at Moorside Primary School and Littlemoss High School.\n\nSince January 2015, Donald has been married to illustrator Katie Halil. A spokesperson for him said \"I can confirm Howard Donald and Katie Halil were married at a private ceremony for close family and friends on 2 January.\"\n\nHe is the father of two daughters from two previous relationships, Grace (born June 1998) and Lola (born February 2005). Grace was born to Victoria Piddington, while he had his younger daughter from his relationship with Marie-Christine Musswessels. He also has two sons, Bowie Taylan (born January 2015) and Dougie Bear (born February 2017), with his wife Katie Halil.\n\nIn April 2010, Donald was granted a super-injunction against former girlfriend, musician Adakini Ntuli, with whom he had been in an on/off relationship from 2000 to 2008. (See Ntuli v Donald) After Ntuli engaged publicist Max Clifford and began negotiations with the \"News of the World\", Donald obtained the super-injunction. The non-publicity side of the injunction was lifted in November 2010.\n\nIn 2007, he sparked controversy when he expressed his view that cannabis should be legalised, saying, \"If more people went out stoned than drunk I think there would be less fighting, less trouble, and less violence.\" He also admitted to having \"dabbled with ecstasy\" in the past.\n\nIn June 2012, it was revealed that along with Take That bandmates Gary Barlow and Mark Owen, Donald had invested £26 million in music industry investment schemes. The news attracted controversy when it was understood that the schemes could serve as tax shelters for high-net-worth people. Lawyers responded to the claims, stating the band members \"paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises.\"\n"}

The term refers to \"an ostentatious, loudly-dressed, and usually ill-mannered man\". The best-known portrayer is George Cole in the 1950s–1960s films.\n\nIn the St Trinian's films, Harry is a long-term associate of the girl pupils, a Cockney involved in all sorts of shady dealings. His father sold racecards and, when he was 12, Harry himself was employed as a boot polisher by Miss Fritton, headmistress of St Trinian's, and may be an antithesis of Harry Flashman (the bully) of the 1857 book \"Tom Brown's School Days\". As an adult, Harry is one of the few whom the pupils trust: he helps to bottle and sell their gin, distilled in the school chemistry lab, and places bets on race horses for them. Harry also runs the St Trinian's Matrimonial Agency for the teenage Sixth Form girls, setting them up with wealthy men. He even runs a betting scam of his own.\n\nBy the time Amber Spottiswood (Dora Bryan) becomes headmistress, Harry's official connection to the school is as \"chairman of the board of governors\" and he earns money as a costermonger while the school is closed.

She was completed during World War II and provided air cover over the amphibious landing at Salerno, Italy in September 1943. The ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean at the end of the year. \"Unicorn\" supported the aircraft carriers of the fleet on their operations until the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944. She was transferred to Australia in early 1945 to support the BPF's operations during Operation \"Iceberg\", the Allied invasion of Okinawa in May. To shorten the time required to replenish the BPF's carriers, the ship was based in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August. \"Unicorn\" was decommissioned and placed in reserve when she returned to the UK in January 1946.\n\nThe ship was recommissioned in 1949 to support the light carrier of the Far East Fleet, as the Eastern Fleet had been redesignated after the end of World War II. She was unloading aircraft and equipment in Singapore in June 1950 when the Korean War began. She spent most of the war ferrying aircraft, troops, stores and equipment in support of Commonwealth operations in Korea. \"Unicorn\" supported other carriers during operations in Korea, but she became the only aircraft carrier to conduct a shore bombardment with her guns during wartime when she attacked North Korean observers on the coast during the war. The ship returned to the UK after the end of the war and was again placed in reserve. She was listed for disposal in 1958 and sold for scrap in 1959.\n\nThe Abyssinia Crisis of 1934–35 demonstrated to the Admiralty that it needed a depot ship to support the aircraft carriers in active service, just like submarine and destroyer tenders supported those types. Such a ship would be able to perform a wider range of aircraft repair and maintenance tasks than aircraft carriers and on the full range of aircraft operated by the Royal Navy, including amphibians. Admiral Reginald Henderson, Controller of the Navy was instrumental for gaining approval for the ship and ensuring that she had a complete flight deck that would allow her to land, service and launch aircraft on active operations. She was the first ship built in any navy that could \"carry out the full range of aircraft maintenance and repair work in addition to the ability to operate aircraft from the flight deck\". In practice, \"Unicorn\" proved the value of the concept and two similar support ships, and were converted into aircraft maintenance ships by modifying light aircraft carriers still under construction.\n\n\"Unicorn\" had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She was somewhat overweight as completed and displaced at standard load rather than her designed . Each of the ship's two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller. Steam was supplied by six Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers operating at a pressure of . The turbines were designed for a total of and gave \"Unicorn\" a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at .\n\nIn order to land aircraft aboard, \"Unicorn\" was designed with a full-length, -long flight deck with arresting gear. She was also fitted with a catapult capable of launching a aircraft to a speed of . The ship had two hangars, each high. The upper hangar was 324ft by 65ft, and the lower 360ft by 62ft. Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); the forward lift measured and the rear one . \"Unicorn\" could carry about 36 operational aircraft. Bulk petrol storage consisted of . During wartime, the ship's crew totaled 1200. The ship carried a self-propelled lighter under the rear of the flight deck to allow unflyable aircraft to be transferred between ships or to shore facilities. This lighter was lowered flush with the upper hangar deck so that an aircraft could be rolled onto it or an aircraft could be lifted onto it once the lighter was in the water.\n\n\"Unicorn\" was armed with four twin mounts for the 45-calibre QF 4-inch Mk XVI dual purpose gun. This mounting could elevate from −10 to +80°. The Mk XVI gun fired about 12 high-explosive shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of . Against surface targets it had a range of and a maximum ceiling of , but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less. She was also equipped with four quadruple mounts for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun (\"pom-pom\"). These gun mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +80°. The Mk VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute. Close-range air defence was provided by twelve 20 mm Oerlikon autocannon, in two twin mounts and eight single ones. The Oerlikon fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . It had a rate of fire of 465–480 rounds per minute and a maximum range of .\n\nThe ship was equipped with two HACS (High Angle Control System) directors on her island and each \"pom-pom\" mount had its own director as well. \"Unicorn\" was the first ship to mount a Type 281B early-warning radar, and each HACS director was fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar.\n\n\"Unicorn\" was ordered on 14 April 1939, and laid down at Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 29 June. Her construction was delayed several times in favour of higher priority projects and she was not launched until 20 November 1941. The ship was completed on 12 March 1943. In order to accelerate the ship's completion, the Admiralty decided in 1942 that she would not be equipped with her full suite of maintenance and repair equipment. Excluding her armament, \"Unicorn\" cost £2,531,000. \n\nWhilst working up, 818 and 824 Squadrons flew aboard in April 1943. 818 Squadron had nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and 824 Squadron had six. 887 Squadron, with nine Supermarine Seafire IIC fighters was also embarked during this time. In late May, \"Unicorn\" escorted Convoy MKF 15 to Gibraltar while carrying a number of Royal Air Force Bristol Beaufighters that she off-loaded there. She escorted the returning convoy back to the Clyde in early June. Together with the aircraft carrier , the ship made a sweep towards the Norwegian coast as part of Operation \"Governor\", a diversion for the Allied landings in Sicily in early July. For this operation, 887 Squadron was replaced by 800 Squadron with Hawker Sea Hurricanes.\n\n\"Unicorn\" was assigned to Force V, a flotilla of British carriers, commanded by Admiral Philip Vian, intended to provide air cover to Operation \"Avalanche\", the Allied landings at Salerno. In preparation for this mission, the ship disembarked all of her Swordfish, except for a small detachment of three from 818 Squadron for self-defence, and the Sea Hurricanes of 800 Squadron. They were replaced by Seafires of 809 and 897 Squadrons. Each of the Seafire squadrons had 10 aircraft, for a total of 33. \"Unicorn\" joined the escort carriers of Force V in August at Gibraltar before they moved forward to the Central Mediterranean for intensive training prior to the commencement of the amphibious landing on 9 September.\n\nThe ship's Seafires flew 75 sorties on the first day of operations and 60 on 10 September, but the Seafire was not well suited to carrier landings in low wind conditions and many were damaged in landing accidents. 44 sorties were flown on 11 September and only 18 on 12 September, even though \"Unicorn\"s mechanics had managed to repair ten Seafires over the previous night. The fighter shortage grew so acute during the operation that fighters from the carriers \"Illustrious\" and , intended to provide distant cover against an attempt by the Italian fleet to interfere with the invasion, staged forward to \"Unicorn\" in order to provide air cover over the landings. By 12 September, the situation had improved so that 887 Squadron was able to fly off six Seafires to a temporary airfield ashore.\n\nThe ship returned to the UK on 20 September with a full load of damaged Seafires, in addition to her own aircraft, that were off-loaded at Glasgow to be repaired. Afterwards, she was refitted by her builders and reconfigured for her designed role as an aircraft repair ship.\n\nAt the end of December 1943, \"Unicorn\" joined \"Illustrious\", the battlecruiser and the battleships and , the other reinforcements for the Eastern Fleet. Only four Swordfish from 818 Squadron were carried aboard at this time. The ship delivered a consignment of aircraft to Royal Navy Air Station Cochin, India, on 27 January 1944 before arriving at Trincomalee, Ceylon on 2 February. In addition to her repair duties, the ship was often used for deck-landing practice. She was given a brief refit in Bombay during May. On 23 August, 818 Squadron was transferred to and later disbanded. On 7 November, 817 Squadron flew aboard to provide anti-submarine protection with its Fairey Barracudas as \"Unicorn\" was ordered to Durban, South Africa. There she was to be modified with separate workshops and additional equipment to accommodate American engines which used different screw threads and electrical fittings.\n\nThat same month, \"Unicorn\" was transferred to the newly formed BPF. She left Durban on 1 January 1945 and arrived at Colombo, Ceylon where she conducted deck-landing practice for pilots new to the BPF. The ship loaded 82 aircraft and 120 engines later in the month for transport to Australia, emptying the available stocks of the Eastern Fleet, and departed for Sydney on 29 January. \"Unicorn\" arrived on 12 February and disembarked her stored aircraft. She sailed for Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 February to support the BPF's training before the opening stages of Operation \"Iceberg\". The ship arrived at San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 27 March which was to serve as the BPF's intermediate replenishment base while it supported Operation \"Iceberg\".\n\nThe BPF was tasked to attack Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands and Formosa before and during the early stages of the invasion of Okinawa. \"Unicorn\" was primarily engaged in preparing aircraft for issue to the operational squadrons aboard the fleet carriers during this time, rather than repair them, but she did repair, modify or service 105 aircraft in March–May 1945. The ship sailed for Australia on 22 May and arrived in Sydney on 1 June. She sailed for Brisbane on 6 June to have her bottom cleaned at the Cairncross Dockyard and to load more replacement aircraft. \"Unicorn\" arrived at Manus on 22 July to prepare for operations off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August. The ship began to ferry aircraft, equipment and men back to Australia after the surrender, a task which ended on 6 November, when she arrived at Sydney. \"Unicorn\" departed for home in December 1945 and arrived in Plymouth in January 1946. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve.\n\nIn 1949, \"Unicorn\" was reactivated for service in the Far East, in support of the carrier . She sailed from HMNB Devonport on 22 September with a cargo of Seafires and Fireflies. When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, the ship was disembarking aircraft, equipment and her maintenance personnel at RAF Sembawang, Singapore in preparation to return home and then to reserve. The Admiralty ordered her to be used as a replenishment carrier to ferry replacement aircraft and supplies to the Royal Navy and Commonwealth aircraft carriers operating in Korean waters. \"Unicorn\" left Singapore on 11 July and arrived at Sasebo, Japan on 20 July and transferred seven Seafires and five Fireflies to \"Triumph\". In August, the ship ferried the 1st Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and the Headquarters of the 27th Brigade from Hong Kong to Pusan, arriving on 29 August. She delivered supplies to Sasebo before returning to Singapore to begin a refit.\n\n\"Unicorn\" resumed her duties in December, carrying about 400 troops in addition to the usual aircraft, stores and equipment. She was used by pilots for deck-landing practice en route. In March, she ferried the Gloster Meteor jet fighters of No. 77 Squadron RAAF to Iwakuni, Japan. The ship remained there for the next three months so she could be used as an accommodation ship. Afterwards, \"Unicorn\" resumed her role as a ferry carrier. Whilst transiting the Shimonoseki Strait on 2 October, she destroyed the overhead power cables stretching between Honshu and Kyushu as they were sagging lower than normal due to a heavy snowfall. On 21 November, \"Unicorn\" and the carrier exchanged crews at Singapore and the ship began a refit shortly afterwards. After her refit was completed on 20 January 1952, she returned to her ferry duties. In April, she was \"adopted\" by the Middlesex Regiment (possibly one of only three ships to be honoured by an Army regiment). During operations by in July, the ship acted as a spare flight deck to allow for damaged aircraft to land without disrupting the strike operations. She arrived back at Singapore on 27 July to load more replacement aircraft, including Meteors, and sailed on 9 August for Japan. During September, \"Unicorn\" borrowed four of \"Ocean\"s Hawker Sea Fury fighters to fly combat air patrols over the fleet whilst the latter ship conducted strike operations. She was docked for maintenance in October, and embarked the First Sea Lord, Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor and the Commander-in-Chief, Far East Station for a tour of Commonwealth forces in Japan. At one point, \"Unicorn\" became the only aircraft carrier to conduct a shore bombardment during wartime when she engaged North Korean coastwatchers at Chopekki Point.\n\nThe ship returned to Singapore for another refit on 15 December and did not leave Singapore until 17 July 1953. On 26 July, en route for Japan, \"Unicorn\" received a distress call from , saying that she was under attack by pirates. The carrier closed on the freighter's position at high speed and the pirates abandoned their prize when \"Unicorn\" circled the freighter with all guns bearing at less than . The Korean Armistice Agreement came into effect the following day, but the ship accompanied \"Ocean\" on two patrols on 30 July and 25–29 August to monitor North Korean compliance with the terms of the armistice. She sailed for home on 15 October and arrived at Devonport on 17 November, where she returned to reserve.\n\nIn 1951, \"Unicorn\" was considered for modernisation to make her capable of operating modern, heavier jet aircraft. This would have required fitting of a steam catapult, reinforcing her flight deck to handle heavier aircraft and moving and enlarging her forward lift to make room for the new catapult and larger aircraft. A new crane would also have been necessary to handle the heavier aircraft. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to combine both of her hangars into a single one to eliminate problems with hangar height, but this was rejected because of the excessive cost. This reconstruction would have begun in July 1954, but the entire scheme was cancelled in November 1952 because providing existing carriers with angled flight decks was much more important.\n\n\"Unicorn\" was redesignated as a Ferry Carrier in June 1953. The ship was reduced to extended reserve in March 1957 and placed on the disposal list in 1958. \"Unicorn\" was sold for scrap in June 1959 and arrived at Dalmuir on 15 June to begin the process. Her hull was broken up at Troon in 1960.\n\n\n\n"}

The plant should not be over watered as it will flop over. Honeybees and butterflies are attracted to this plant and it may be restricted by growing in containers or in lawns that tend to be mowed. It requires little maintenance, although Deadheading is beneficial.\n\nIt prefers a sandy, well-drained soil. Heavy, clay-based soil retains moisture in winter months, which can kill many species. However, rhizomatous coreopsis (underground stems) are well-adapted to withstand the extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry). Adding compost to heavy soil can improve drainage as can creating a mounded bed, allows the planting area to shed rain faster than the ground around it. It thrives in full sun (4–6 hours of direct sunlight per day).\n\n"}

Originally designed as a heavy cruiser and laid down under the name \"Cavendish\", she was converted into an aircraft carrier while still being built. Renamed in 1918, she was completed a few weeks before the end of the war and saw no active service with the Grand Fleet. The following year she participated in the British campaign in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks during which her aircraft made numerous attacks against the naval base at Kronstadt. \"Vindictive\" returned home at the end of the year and was placed in reserve for several years before her flight decks were removed and she was reconverted back into a cruiser. The ship retained her aircraft hangar and conducted trials with an aircraft catapult before she was sent to the China Station in 1926. A year after her return in 1928, she was again placed in reserve.\n\n\"Vindictive\" was demilitarized and converted into a training ship in 1936–1937. At the beginning of the Second World War she was converted into a repair ship. Her first role after the conversion was completed in early 1940, however, was to transport troops during the Norwegian Campaign. She was then sent to the South Atlantic to support British ships serving there and, in late 1942, to the Mediterranean to support the ships there. \"Vindictive\" returned home in 1944 and was damaged by a German torpedo off the coast of Normandy after the Allies invaded France. She was reduced to reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1946.\n\nThe \"Hawkins\"-class cruiser was designed to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders. The design was also given high freeboard to allow it to maintain its speed in heavy weather. Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS \"Cavendish\" after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.\n\nThe cruisers had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of at deep load. They were designed to displace and had a complement of 37 officers and 672 enlisted men.\n\nThe ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of for a speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by 12 Yarrow boilers; 8 of these were oil-fired while the remaining 4 used coal. They had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of .\n\nThe main armament of the \"Hawkins\"-class cruisers consisted of seven 45-calibre Mk VI guns in pivot mounts. They were arranged in two superfiring pairs, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, one on each broadside abreast the rear funnel, and the last was on the quarterdeck at the same level as the lower of the rear superfiring pair; they were designated 1 through 7 from front to rear. At maximum elevation these guns fired a shell to a range of .\n\nTheir secondary armament comprised a dozen quick-firing (QF) 3-inch 20 cwt guns. Eight of these were on low-angle mounts intended for use against torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence. They also mounted two submerged tubes, one on each broadside, and four above-water tubes, two on each broadside, for 21-inch torpedoes.\n\nThe \"Hawkins\"-class cruisers were protected with an armour that had a maximum thickness of 4 inches abreast the ships' magazines and a minimum thickness of . It consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel of varying thicknesses that covered most of the ships' sides. The decks had a maximum thickness of over the engine rooms, boilers, and the steering gear. The conning tower and its communication tube were protected by the only Krupp cemented armour in the ships and had thicknesses of 3 inches and respectively.\n\nIn January 1917, the Board of Admiralty reviewed the navy's aircraft carrier requirements and decided to order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck as well as a landing deck aft. The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities, so the Admiralty decided to convert \"Cavendish\", already under construction, in June 1917.\n\nNo. 2 7.5-inch gun, two 3-inch guns and the conning tower were removed and the forward superstructure was remodelled into a hangar with a capacity for six reconnaissance aircraft. The hangar roof, with a small extension, formed the flying-off deck. The aircraft were hoisted up through a hatch at the aft end of the flying-off deck by two derricks. The landing deck required the removal of Nos. 5 and 6 7.5-inch guns and moving the four 3-inch AA guns to an elevated platform between the funnels, in lieu of the 3-inch guns intended for that position. A port side gangway wide connected the landing and flying-off decks to allow aircraft with their wings folded to be wheeled from one to the other. A crash barrier was hung from \"the gallows\" at the forward end of the landing on deck. To increase her stability after the addition of so much topweight, the upper portion of her anti-torpedo bulge was enlarged.\n\nAlthough still overweight compared to her designed displacement, the modifications made the ship lighter than her sister ships, at light displacement and a metacentric height of . She completed her sea trials on 21 September 1918 and reached a speed of from .\n\n\"Cavendish\" was laid down at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918. In June she was renamed \"Vindictive\", the fifth ship of that name in the RN, to perpetuate the name of the old protected cruiser , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May. She commissioned on 1 October and, after briefly working up, joined the Grand Fleet's Flying Squadron on 18 October only a few weeks before the Armistice on 11 November. For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises, including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft, of which two were lost in accidents. The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet's last operational Sopwith Pup. Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels, had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed. Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving.\n\n\"Vindictive\" was dispatched to the Baltic with a dozen aircraft, a mix of Griffins, Sopwith 2F.1 fighters, Sopwith 1½ Strutter and Short Type 184 bombers, on 2 July 1919 to participate in the British campaign in the Baltic in support of the White Russians and the newly independent Baltic states. On 6 July she ran aground on a shoal near Reval at speed. Stuck hard in the tideless Baltic, all of her fuel was dumped overboard, and most of her ammunition as well. Some of stores were also off-loaded, but the ship could not be towed free by the combined efforts of the light cruisers and and three tugboats. Eight days after grounding a fortuitous westerly wind began that raised the water level by , just enough to pull the ship free. Unbeknownst to the British the entire operation had taken place in a minefield. \nThe carrier unloaded her air group, commanded by Major Grahame Donald, at Koivisto, Finland on 14 July. Their airfield was still under construction, but they were able to fly a reconnaissance mission over the major Bolshevik naval base at Kronstadt on 26 July while \"Vindictive\" sailed to Copenhagen, Denmark, to load aircraft and spares left for her by the carrier . Four days later, Rear Admiral Walter Cowan ordered Donald and his aircraft to attack Kronstadt at night. As their airfield was not yet finished, the ship's flying-off deck was extended to to better allow the bombers to take off with their bombs. Accurate anti-aircraft fire kept the aircraft too high for an effective attack, but Donald's men claimed two hits on the submarine tender \"Pamiat Azova\". In reality one bomb struck the oil tanker \"Tatiana\", setting it on fire and killing one man. That same day eight RN Coastal Motor Boat (CMB)s arrived; \"Vindictive\" served as their depot ship.\n\n\"Vindictive\"s aircraft continued to support British operations against the Bolsheviks until they left the Baltic in December, although no further missions were flown from the carrier. They shot down a helium-filled observation balloon and spotted for ships conducted shore bombardments. Most importantly, nine of them attacked Kronstadt during the night of 17/18 August 1919 to provide a diversion for an attack by the CMBs on ships in Kronstadt harbour. As a result, the torpedo boats damaged the battleship and sank \"Pamiat Azova\". In subsequent attacks on Kronstadt, they nearly hit \"Andrei Pervozvanny\" while she was in drydock, nearly hit a minesweeper, killing one crewman from the explosion, and hit two auxiliary ships. By December it was clear that the Whites' offensive against Petrograd had failed and the British began withdrawing; \"Vindictive\" left three Camels in Latvia, embarked the rest of her aircraft and sailed for home on 22 December.\n\nShe was paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 December and received permanent repairs of her damage from the grounding, at a cost of £200,000. \"Furious\" and \"Vindictive\" had proven that the idea of \"cruiser-carriers\" was unworkable due to the turbulence from their superstructures and that a complete flight deck was necessary to successfully operate aircraft at sea. The Admiralty had considered converting her to that configuration, with an island, in July 1918 while still building, but had decided to wait on the results of tests conducted with \"Argus\" evaluating different designs for the island. \"Vindictive\" was thought to be too small to be an effective carrier and the financial restrictions in place after the war vitiated against such a major reconstruction.\n\nFor the next several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport, until she began reconversion into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923. The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration, although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns. Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns. The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure. The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof. No. 2's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft catapult, the first British cruiser to mount a catapult. \"Vindictive\" used it for the first time on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane. She also conducted catapult trials on float-equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters.\n\nShe sailed for the China Station on 1 January 1926 with six Fairey IIIDs aboard for anti-piracy patrols and departed for home on 14 March 1928. She arrived in May and her catapult was removed in October, ending her career as an aviation ship. \"Vindictive\" was again reduced to reserve in 1929, making occasional trooping voyages. In July 1935 the ship was briefly sailed from her reserve mooring to join in the King George V's Silver Jubilee Fleet Review held on the 15th.\n\nIn 1936–1937, \"Vindictive\" was demilitarised in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty and converted to a training ship for cadets. Her two inboard propellers were removed as were the inboard turbines; half of her boilers were removed and their compartments were converted into accommodations. The aft funnel was removed, the aft superstructure remodelled and enlarged and her hangar converted into more accommodation space. Her armament, including the above-water torpedo tubes, was replaced by a pair of guns forward and a quadruple QF 2-pounder (\"pom-pom\") AA mount aft. In this form she displaced and was capable of a maximum speed of . She was recommissioned on 7 September 1937.\n\nAfter the Second World War began in August 1939, \"Vindictive\" was transferred to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister , with nine guns, four twin-gun mounts and a catapult. She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October, when a less complex modernisation was considered. This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns, and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range, but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship. Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar's roof. Her aft superstructure was extended to be flush with her sides and slightly lengthened, and a large deckhouse was built on the quarterdeck. Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns, all on the centreline, two quadruple \"pom-pom\" mounts, one on each side, and six depth charges. In this role, she had a standard displacement of ( at full load) and her draught increased to .\nThe conversion was completed on 30 March 1940, just in time for the ship to be used with the Home Fleet as a troop transport during the Norwegian Campaign. She ferried British troops to Narvik in late April and escorted an evacuation convoy from Harstad on 4 June. \"Vindictive\" was transferred to the South Atlantic later in the year and remained there until late 1942, when she was ordered north. On the night of 12 November, she was attacked west of Gibraltar by the , but managed to evade the torpedoes. \"U-515\" sank the accompanying destroyer tender and blew the stern off one of the escorting destroyers, . She remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1944, when she was recalled to support the ships participating in Operation Overlord.\n\nDuring this time she received her first radars. By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set as well as a Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar. By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar. Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, three on each side of the roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel. In 1944 \"Vindictive\" was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons. Later that year, the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added. In early August 1944, the ship was damaged by a long-range, circling, \"Dackel\" torpedo dropped by the Luftwaffe off the coast of Normandy. In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons. She was paid off into reserve on 8 September 1945 and was sold for scrap on 24 January 1946. \"Vindictive\" was subsequently broken up at Blyth.\n\n\n"}

G. Wodehouse. Sometimes referred to as a \"nerve specialist\" or a \"loony doctor\", he is a prominent practitioner of psychiatry in Wodehouse's works, appearing in several Jeeves stories and in one Blandings Castle story.\n\nThough he is initially antagonistic towards Bertie Wooster, they become friends in later stories.\n\nThe character of Sir Roderick Glossop was inspired by Dr. Henry Crawford MacBryan, who operated a psychiatric nursing home in the hamlet of Ditteridge, in the village of Box, Wiltshire, near Cheney House where a young Wodehouse lived with his aunts.\n\nSir Roderick Glossop is the father of Honoria Glossop and Oswald Glossop. He is first married to Lady Glossop, a friend of Bertie's Aunt Agatha, and later to Lady Chuffnell, aunt of \"Chuffy\", Lord Chuffnell. He went to school with Lord Emsworth, who states that Glossop was an unpleasant boy who had a nasty and superior manner. Glossop has a pleasant baritone voice, and as a penniless medical student, sang at smoking concerts. His residences are 6b Harley Street and Ditteredge Hall, Hampshire.\n\nHe is formally called a nerve specialist or a brain specialist, though Bertie thinks of him as a \"high-priced loony-doctor\". Even after they become friends, Bertie still refers to Glossop as \"the eminent loony doctor\". He is a well-known psychiatrist, and, according to Bertie, \"practically every posh family in the country has called him in at one time or another\". He is described as serious-minded by Bertie Wooster's Aunt Agatha, who tells Bertie that Sir Roderick is President of the West London branch of the anti-gambling league, drinks no wine, disapproves of smoking, and, due to an impaired digestion, can only eat simple food. She also says that he does not approve of coffee, as he considers it \"the root of half the nerve-trouble in the world.\"\n\nWhen Bertie sees Glossop in \"Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch\", he describes Glossop as an \"extraordinarily formidable old bird,\" stating:\n\nHe had a pair of shaggy eyebrows which gave his eyes a piercing look which was not at all the sort of thing a fellow wanted to encounter on an empty stomach. He was fairly tall and fairly broad, and he had the most enormous head, with practically no hair on it, which made it seem bigger and much more like the dome of St Paul's. I suppose he must have taken about a nine or something in hats. Shows what a rotten thing it is to let your brain develop too much.\n\nIn that story, Glossop has lunch with Bertie to judge whether or not Bertie is mentally sound and fit to marry Honoria. Incidents arise that lead him to render a negative judgment, especially when Glossop, who strongly dislikes cats, is surprised by three cats in Bertie's flat. This incident is often recounted in later stories, with the number of cats being exaggerated as twenty-three. In \"Bingo and the Little Woman\", Glossop corroborates a claim that Bertie is mentally unsound. These stories appear in \"The Inimitable Jeeves\".\n\nHe forbids the marriage between Bertie's friend Charles \"Biffy\" Biffen and his daughter Honoria in \"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\", much to Biffy's relief. He also appears in \"Without the Option\". Both stories are collected in \"Carry On, Jeeves\". In \"Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit\" (in \"Very Good, Jeeves\"), he is the unintended victim of a prank when Bertie punctures his hot water bottle. In this story, Glossop mentions that he is nervous about fires.\n\nIn \"Thank You, Jeeves\", he has been a widower for two years, and wants to marry Myrtle, Lady Chuffnell. Glossop obtains the use of Chuffnell Hall as a clinic, funded by J. Washburn Stoker. In \"Jeeves in the Offing\", he pretends to be a butler at Brinkley Court named Swordfish (the name being suggested by Bobbie Wickham) in order to surreptitiously observe one of the guests, Wilbert Cream, and judge his sanity. It is also stated in this novel that Glossop still runs the clinic at Chuffnell Regis, and that Myrtle has become Lady Glossop, suggesting that they are married. Glossop is mentioned in the last Jeeves short story, \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\".\n\nOutside the Jeeves canon, Glossop appears in the Blandings Castle and Uncle Fred novel, \"Uncle Fred in the Springtime\", in which he is impersonated by Pongo Twistleton's Uncle Fred at Blandings Castle. In \"Cocktail Time\", he is a member of the Demosthenes Club, which is situated immediately opposite the Drones Club, and is briefly seen at the Demosthenes.\n\nThough they are not friendly towards each other in the early stories, Glossop bonds with Bertie in \"Thank You, Jeeves\" (1934) when they both have to endure going about the countryside wearing blackface. As Bertie tells Jeeves, \"From now on, there will always be a knife and fork for Bertram at the Glossop lair, and the same for Roddy \"chez\" Bertram\".\n\nInconsistencies in the relationship between Bertie and Glossop arise in the later novel \"Jeeves in the Offing\" (1960), as they do not seem to be on terms of friendship in the beginning of the story. When Bertie learns his Aunt Dahlia is going to have lunch with Glossop, Bertie states that Glossop \"was a man I would not have cared to lunch with myself\". However, they become friends in \"Jeeves in the Offing\", after they bond over their realization that they each stole biscuits from the school headmaster's study as children. They start addressing each other as \"Bertie\" and \"Roddy\".\n\nNotably, in the 1965 short story \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\", Bertie tells Jeeves that he and \"Roddy\" are good friends, citing the ordeals they shared in \"Thank You, Jeeves\". Sir Roderick has not yet married Lady Chuffnell in this story.\n\nTo explain why Bertie and Sir Roderick are not already friends at the start of \"Jeeves in the Offing\", Wodehouse scholar J. H. C. Morris suggested that Bertie and Sir Roderick had an undisclosed quarrel sometime after \"Thank You, Jeeves\" and before \"Jeeves in the Offing\", implying that \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\" occurs before this quarrel.\n\nBertie continues to regard Sir Roderick Glossop as a friend in \"Much Obliged, Jeeves\" (1971). He describes \"Roddy\" as one of his leading pals.\n\nRoderick Glossop appears in:\n\nHe is mentioned in several stories, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2161849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161849", "title": "The Myth of the Twentieth Century", "text": "The Myth of the Twentieth Century\n\nThe Myth of the Twentieth Century () is a 1930 book by Alfred Rosenberg, one of the principal ideologues of the Nazi Party and editor of the Nazi paper \"Völkischer Beobachter\". The titular \"myth\" (in the special Sorelian sense) is \"the myth of blood, which under the sign of the swastika unchains the racial world-revolution. It is the awakening of the race-soul, which after long sleep victoriously ends the race chaos.\"\n\nThe book has been described as \"one of the two great unread bestsellers of the Third Reich\" (the other being \"Mein Kampf\"). In private Adolf Hitler said: \"I must insist that Rosenberg's \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\" is not to be regarded as an expression of the official doctrine of the party.\" Hitler objected to Rosenberg's paganism.\n\nHitler awarded the first State Prize for Art and Science to the author of \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\". The official document accompanying the prize \"expressly praises Rosenberg as a 'person who has, in a scientific and penetrating manner, laid the firm foundation for an understanding of the ideological bases of National Socialism.'\"\n\nRosenberg was inspired by the theories of Arthur de Gobineau, in his 1853–1855 book \"An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\", and by Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Rosenberg's \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\" was conceived as a sequel to Chamberlain's 1899 book \"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century\". Rosenberg believed that God created mankind as separate, differentiated races in a cascading hierarchy of nobility of virtue, not as separate individuals or as entities with \"blank slate\" natures. Rosenberg harshly rejected the idea of a \"globular\" mankind of homogeneity of nature as counter-factual, and asserted each biological race possesses a discrete, unique soul, claiming the Caucasoid Aryan race, with Germanic Nordics supposedly composing its vanguard elite, as qualitatively superior, in a vaguely \"ontological\" way, in comparison to all other ethnic and racial groupings: the Germanic Nordic Aryan as Platonic ideal of humankind.\n\nOther influences included the anti-modernist, \"revolutionary\" ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner's Holy Grail romanticism inspired by the neo-Buddhist thesis of Arthur Schopenhauer, Haeckelian mystical vitalism, the medieval German philosopher Meister Eckhart and the heirs of his mysticism and Nordicist Aryanism in general.\n\nRosenberg's racial interpretation of history concentrates on the negative influence of the Jewish race in contrast to the Aryan race. He equates the latter with the Nordic peoples of northern Europe and also includes the Berbers from North Africa and the upper classes of Ancient Egypt. According to Rosenberg, modern culture has been corrupted by Semitic influences (cf. anti-Semitism), which have produced degenerate modern art, along with moral and social degeneration. In contrast, Aryan culture is defined by innate moral sensibility and an energetic will to power. Rosenberg believed that the higher races must rule over the lower and not interbreed with them, because cross-breeding destroys the divine combination of physical heredity and spirit. He uses an organic metaphor of the race and the State and argues that the Nazis must purify the race soul by eliminating non-Aryan elements in much the same ruthless and uncompromising way in which a surgeon would cut a cancer from a diseased body.\n\nIn Rosenberg's view of world history, migrating Aryans founded various ancient civilizations which later declined and fell due to inter-marriage with lesser races. These civilizations included the Indo-Aryan civilization, ancient Persia, Greece, and Rome. He saw the ancient Germanic invasions of the Roman empire as \"saving\" its civilization, which had been corrupted both by race mixing and by \"Judaized-cosmopolitan\" Christianity. Furthermore, he claimed that the persecutions of Protestants in France and other areas represented the wiping out of the last remnants of the Aryan element in those areas, a process completed by the French revolution. In contemporary Europe, he saw the northern areas that embraced Protestantism as closest to the Aryan racial and spiritual ideal.\n\nFollowing H. S. Chamberlain and other \"völkisch\" theorists, he believed that Jesus was an Aryan (specifically an Amorite or Hurrian Hittite), and that original Christianity was an \"Aryan\" (Iranian) religion, but had been corrupted by the followers of Paul of Tarsus. The \"Mythus\" is very anti-Catholic, seeing the Church's cosmopolitanism and \"Judaized\" version of Christianity as one of the factors in Germany's spiritual bondage. Rosenberg particularly emphasizes the anti-Judaic teachings of the heresies Marcionism and \"Aryo-Persian\" Manicheanism as more representative of the true, \"anti-Judaic\" Jesus Christ and more suited to the Nordic world-view. Rosenberg saw Martin Luther and the Reformation as an important step forward toward reasserting the \"Aryan spirit\", but as ultimately ambiguous in not having gone far enough in its founding of just another dogmatic church.\n\nWhen he discussed the future of religion in the future Reich, he suggested that a multiplicity of forms be tolerated, including \"positive Christianity\", neo-paganism, and a form of \"purified\" Aryan Hinduism. He saw all these religious systems as allegorical after the manner of Schopenhauer's teaching of religion as \"folk-metaphysics\", and was skeptical that the Nordic gods, of which the keys of interpretation had been largely lost in involutive time, could gain a foothold in modern times, without even conceding the desirability of the possibility.\n\nAnother myth, to which he gave \"allegorical\" and esoteric credence, was the hermetical idea of Atlantis, which he felt might preserve a memory of an ancient Aryan homeland:\n\nAnd so today the long derived hypothesis becomes a probability, namely that from a northern centre of creation which, without postulating an actual submerged Atlantic continent, we may call Atlantis, swarms of warriors once fanned out in obedience to the ever renewed and incarnate Nordic longing for distance to conquer and space to shape.\n\nThis account of world history is used to support his dualistic model of human experience, as are ideas co-opted from Nietzsche and Social Darwinist writers of the era.\n\nThanks to Nazi support, the book had sold more than one million copies by 1944. However, Adolf Hitler declared that it was not to be considered official ideology of the Nazi Party:\n\nAccording to Konrad Heiden, Rosenberg had given the manuscript to Hitler to vet before its publication. After a year Hitler still had nothing to say. Hitler gave the still-unread work back to him saying, \"I feel sure that it's all right.\" In his diary Joseph Goebbels called the book \"very good\" when he first read it. Albert Speer however remembered that Goebbels mocked Alfred Rosenberg. Goebbels also called the book a \"philosophical belch\".\n\nHermann Göring said: \"if Rosenberg was to decide ... we would only have rite, thing, myth and such kind of swindle.\" Gustave Gilbert, the prison psychologist during the Nuremberg Trials, reported that none of the Nazi leaders he interviewed had read Rosenberg's writings.\n\nIts overt statement of anti-Christian sentiment made it difficult to give Rosenberg any position of prominence when the Nazis ascended to power. Even in their stronghold Hamburg only 0.49% of the inhabitants identified as belonging to the anti-Christian neopagan faith movement (in 1937), whereas the German Christians and their Positive Christianity had a strong standing. Many of the attacks on the book after its 1930 publication came from its explicit anti-Christian message. Rosenberg wrote two supplements to the work, replying to Catholic and Protestant critics. In the first, \"On the Dark Men of Our Times: A Reply to Critics of the Myth of the Twentieth Century\", he accused Catholics of attempting to destroy the national character by promoting separatism within Catholic parts of the country. His second reply, \"Protestant Pilgrims to Rome: The Treason Against Luther and the Myth of the Twentieth Century\", argued that modern Lutheranism was becoming too close to Catholicism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2161850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161850", "title": "Zuiderhofje", "text": "Zuiderhofje\n\nThe Zuiderhofje is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands.\n\nThe hofje was founded in 1640 by Jacques van Damme and his wife Elisabeth Blinckvliedt, and is owned by the Mennonite church of Haarlem. The couple gave an order to Michael Slaghreegen on the 25th of February 1640, to purchase a house on the Zuiderstraat and build a few houses there for elderly women of the \"Vlaemsche Block\", the largest branch of Mennonites in Haarlem at that time. This branch was primarily Flemish in origin, and their church \"De Olijblock\" was located on the Klein Heiligland street, near their orphanage, \"Het Doopsgezinde Weeshuis\". The orphanage archives date back to 1634, and its location adjoined the former hofje \"Blokshofje\", that can still be seen, but was sold by the Mennonite church in 1970. A commemorative plaque on the front explains the history of that house.\n\nThis hofje is one of four Mennonite hofjes in Haarlem; the others are the Wijnbergshofje in the Barrevoetestraat, the Bruiningshofje on the Botermarkt, and the Blokshofje on the Klein Heiligland sold in 1970. This is not counting the Teylers Hofje, though its founder was Mennonite and its former location had also been a Mennonite hofje. Considering the fact that the Mennonite community was never more than 5% of the Haarlem population, it is unusual that they have always been in the majority among the regents of Haarlem hofjes. The reason is that the Mennonites in Haarlem ran a quarter of all charity work for centuries in Haarlem, until government control slowly took over in the 20th century. The Haarlem archives mention the followers of Zwingli as far back as 1530. The Frisian preacher Menno Simons was not the founder of this faith, but a later leader. This is why the Dutch Mennonites don't call themselves Mennonites, but \"Doopsgezind\", or Anabaptist. Each Doopsgezind group is autonomous. The main rules of the faith in 1640 were:\n\n\nMany Haarlem Mennonites were Flemish immigrants from Menen, in Belgium, who came for the linen trade, but there was also a large group who came from Friesland, and friction between these groups was common. Since most men of influence in Haarlem at that time were members of the schutterij, the only way for influential men of the Mennonite community to advance themselves socially was through social work and cultural donations. \n\nOfficially, the Mennonite faith was only tolerated, and not recognized by the Haarlem city council. The Mennonite churches were underground, but its members could move freely in society, just as the Catholics could do after the Protestant Reformation of 1572. The only difference was that they had to pay \"wachtgeld\" to avoid the schutterij militia service. The Flemish Mennonites were the strictest followers of their faith. In 1598 a scandal over a bankruptcy caused a schism in the Haarlem Mennonite church, and in 1620 a controversy arose over the question whether a man could fondle his betrothed's breast before marriage. This question split the church, so that at the time of the Hofje's founding, there were 5 Mennonite groups in Haarlem. All of these communities were known for their shunning of members who broke the rules.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1642, Elisabeth Blinkvliedt decided to write up a codicil to their bequest of the hofje. Knowing her church well, she stipulated that the hofje regents could act as they saw fit, without any influence of the Mennonite church except that the regents should be members of it. The appointing of regents was only to be done by the current sitting regents, and the business of the hofje was to have no communion with the business of the Mennonite church. She then appointed the sitting group of regents, and these were\n\nShe then added a new house and garden to the complex in 1644, and as though this wasn't enough, she also added a new house and garden to the Bruiningshofje in 1647. In the archives of the Bruiningshofje a sum of 150 \"Carolus guldens\" is recorded for this purpose, received from \"Lysbeth van Blenckvliet\".\n\nIn 1649 she wrote a \"Memorie\", or memoir, in which she asks the regents of this hofje to do a few more things for her after her death. Thanks to this paper we know that she and her husband were the founders of the above-mentioned orphanage in the 1630s, and in her memoir she echoes her stipulation for the hofje that \"the orphanage should be completely self-supporting, with no interference by the Mennonite church\". Her gifts on her death were quite substantial, and are the reason that the hofje was to last for so many centuries, despite later upheavals in the Haarlem Mennonite community.\n\nIn 1672 the Haarlem Mennonite community was split in two and the Zuiderhofje had to give up a third of its wealth to the \"Gemeente van Vollenhove\". In 1683 the \"Vlaemsche Block\", now merged with the \"Waterlandsche Gemeente\", moved to a new church building in the Frankestraat, where the Haarlem Mennonite community still resides today. In 1685 the hofje was appointed new regents from this united church, which was directly against the wishes of Elisabeth Blinckvliedt. In 1714 this was declared illegal, but in 1716 a final decision was made to allow the church to appoint the regents, and the hofje was declared the property of the church. In 1749 the Mennonite communities rejoined and the old property rights were restored, except that the church kept its (illegal) governance. In 1782 the regents wrote a letter to the church to complain. The church protested that it had made donations to the hofje since 1685. Finally, in 1784, a decision was made to allow the various Mennonite hofjes to exist independently of each other, and independently of the church. The hofjes mentioned were the Winbergshofje and the Zuiderhofje.\n\nAfter a glorious period in the 18th and early 19th centuries, thanks to rich donations by regents, the hofje slowly declined. In 1887 the first discussions about restoration began and in 1891 the hofje was completely torn down and rebuilt. In 1892 the elderly women returned to their new homes after a year of living elsewhere. The hofje, together with the Hofje van Gratie, was threatened with destruction in the 1960s when the library was built (located in the old stadsdoelen, or target practise for the city schutterij). In the end only the Hofje van Gratie was torn down. This hofje now stands as an island among newer buildings.\n\nThe hofje is for single, senior women.\n\nAddress: Zuiderstraat\n\n\n"}

The competition is conducted by Football NSW, the organising body in New South Wales (the other being the National Premier Leagues Northern NSW organised by Northern NSW Football). The league is a subdivision of the second tier National Premier Leagues (NPL), which sits below the national A-League. Prior to becoming a subdivision of the NPL in 2013, the league was previously known as the NSW Premier League.\n\nAs of 2012, all matches have been filmed and a weekly highlights package has been made available online, while the Grand Final has been streamed live through Football NSW since 2013.\n\nSince 1956, a top divisional New South Wales based league has been contested annually in various forms, with its early days remembered as Division One. The league, jointly with other state based leagues, were the highest tiers of soccer in Australia until the formation of a national league, the National Soccer League (NSL), in 1977. Prior to NSL, the Ampol Cup also ran concurrently as a state based cup competition. In 1977 Division One officially changed its name to NSW State League, however reverted to NSW Division One by 1983. The league continued to be contested throughout the winter months and included another name change in 1992 to the NSW Super League. During the 1980s and 1990s, Melita Eagles and Blacktown City FC were dominate in the league winning nine championships between them.\n\nAt the end of 2000, the top soccer divisions were revamped with the highest level of soccer being named the Premier League and being played over summer to align with the then top tier of soccer in Australia (NSL). The second highest NSW league was named the Winter Super League and played throughout 2001. The 2004–05 season saw the return of the New South Wales NSL giants in Sydney Olympic, Sydney United 58, Wollongong Wolves and Marconi Stallions. This was the result of another overhaul of the entire national league structure. The NSL was abolished and the A-League took its place at the top of the soccer hierarchy in Australia. As this competition significantly reduced the teams from New South Wales to just three (Sydney FC, Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets) these clubs were forced to return to the state leagues. The NSW Premier League continued to be run over summer throughout this period but after the 2004–05 season reverted to a winter competition from 2006.\n\nIn 2008 the whole New South Wales men's, women's and youth competitions were reconstructed to align youth teams with their respective senior clubs along with women's teams.\n\nIn 2013 the FFA announced another re-structure, this time to tier 2 level of soccer in Australia. This saw the top league in each state united under a single banner called the National Premier Leagues, with the NSW Premier League rebranded as the National Premier Leagues NSW. Bonnyrigg White Eagles became the inaugural champions of this competition after defeating Rockdale City Suns 1–0 in the final. Sydney United 58 FC were crowned premiers after placing first in the standing at the end of the regular season, earning the right to compete in the inaugural National Premier Leagues Finals. Sydney United went on to win this tournament defeating Tasmanian side South Hobart FC 2–0 in the final. In 2014, premiers Bonnyrigg White Eagles failed to reach the grand final and Blacktown City FC were crowned champions. They defeated Sydney Olympic 2–1 after extra time.\n\nThere are 22 Rounds in total with each team playing each other twice; home and away.\n\nAt the completion of the league series, the NPL NSW top of the table, joins the winners from the other NPL subdivisions in a national eight team finals series. The national final series consists of a three round knock-out series based on geographically close subdivision champions playing each other, culminating in a grand final.\n\nThe top five sides at the end of the season compete in the Championship Series. The Championship Series consists of six games, whereby the five teams competing are whittled down to just two. The teams are seeded upon their entry into the Championship Series according to their final position on the ladder. The final two teams compete in the Grand Final, where a NSW Premier League Champion is decided.\n\nThe following 12 clubs will be competing in the National Premier Leagues NSW for the 2020 season.\n\nBold indicates Federation Double winners – i.e. League Championship and League Premiership OR League Championship and Federation/Waratah Cup OR League Premiership and Federation/Waratah Cup \nBold and Underlined indicates Federation Treble winners – i.e. League Championship, League Premiership and Federation/Waratah Cup winners\n\nSource: SoccerAust\n\nBold indicates Federation Double winners – i.e. League Championship and League Premiership OR League Championship and Federation/Waratah Cup OR League Premiership and Federation/Waratah Cup \nBold and Underlined indicates Federation Treble winners – i.e. League Championship, League Premiership and Federation/Waratah Cup winners\n\nThis list includes all champions and premiers since the inaugural league of 1957.

As a subdivision of the nationwide NPL, the league is the highest level within the Victorian soccer league system, serving jointly as the second tier within the overall Australian pyramid.\n\nAdministered by Football Victoria, NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the Victorian State League and later as the Victorian Premier League, the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following Football Federation Australia's 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a knock-out finals series, with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, NPL 2. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the national finals series, whilst the champion plays against the Dockerty Cup winner in the FV Community Shield.\n\nThe league commenced in 1909 with Carlton United being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, Juventus' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by South Melbourne Hellas and Footscray JUST, which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the National Soccer League (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was Green Gully, who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984–1986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted North Geelong. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams Melbourne Knights and South Melbourne were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when Vodafone became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and Heidelberg United, but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, Sunshine George Cross were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that Essendon Royals had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the Australian Institute of Sport evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the Melbourne Victory youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including Southern Stars FC players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the National Premier Leagues, with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season. Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team. However, by December 2013, a resolution was reached whereby Victorian teams would participate in the 2014 season.\n\nNPL Victoria comprises 14 teams. The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style round-robin and Australian-style finals series within its competition format. \nThe regular season consists of a double round-robin. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by goal difference and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head away goals as further tiebreakers if necessary. The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the national NPL finals. \nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3–6 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the grand final, played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all knock-out fixtures. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time are played. A penalty shoot-out is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of promotion and relegation with the division immediately below it, NPL 2. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\nEastern Lions and St Albans were promoted from NPL 2 in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while Pascoe Vale and Kingston City were relegated as the two last-placed finishers. Dandenong Thunder avoided relegation by winning the promotion/relegation play-off against Bulleen Lions.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n"}

She attended Yarmouth Academy and later studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York. During the Second World War, she worked as a secretary in Montreal and Toronto, and in 1945 married fellow Nova Scotian Joseph Howe Grant, a professional engineer. Together they lived first in Toronto and later in Kleinburg north of the city. She disliked being called Hilda and was known to all by her maiden name of Kay.\n\nDuring her years in Toronto, she was an active member of both the Heliconian Club and the Canadian Authors' Association, and a mentor to many writers and painters. When the American publishing firm of Abelard-Schuman had a Canadian subsidiary, she was its fiction editor and oversaw many Canadian writers into print.\n\nGrant published her first book, \"The Salt Box\", in her 40s and continued writing for less than twenty years. Written under the pseudonym Jan Hilliard, \"The Salt Box\" won the prestigious Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour in 1952. \"The Salt Box\" was followed by \"A View of the Town\". \"Miranda\" and \"The Jameson Girls\" were both novels of reminiscence, the latter about the family of a dying rum-runner, which caused some controversy in her hometown. \"Dove Cottage\" was based on the author's own house outside the city, and \"Morgan's Castle\" was set in the fictitious village of Greenwood in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario. As \"The New York Times\" wrote at the time, \"Few such credible and practical murderers have flourished in fiction. Miss Hilliard persuades one that they are commoner in life… [she] writes a sure sense of atmosphere\".\n\n\"Morgan's Castle\" was Grant's last novel, although she published three subsequent works of non-fiction under her own name. \"Robert Stevenson, engineer and sea-builder\", was a biography of the lighthouse builder and grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson. She received a Canadian Centennial Commission grant to research and write \"Samuel Cunard, Pioneer of the Atlantic Steamship\", and was a Canada Council Award recipient. She also published short stories and poetry in such magazines as \"Maclean's\", \"Chatelaine\" and \"Canadian Poetry\". \nA lifelong gardener, even when limited to a balcony in her later years, she co-authored \"Small City Gardens\" with William S. Brett in 1967. She soon left writing forever, returning to her first artistic interest of painting, and in her later years was recognized as an accomplished watercolorist. She often supplied illustrations for her own books.\n\nShe died on May 11, 1996 at her home in Toronto and her cremated remains were interred in the Grant family plot in Riverside Cemetery in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Jan Hilliard, she wrote six novels: \n\n\n"}

Many are physical contacts with molecular associations between chains that occur in a cell or in a living organism in a specific biomolecular context.\n\nProteins rarely act alone as their functions tend to be regulated. Many molecular processes within a cell are carried out by molecular machines that are built from numerous protein components organized by their PPIs. These interactions make up the so-called interactomics of the organism, while aberrant PPIs are the basis of multiple aggregation-related diseases, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob, Alzheimer's diseases.\n\nPPIs have been studied with many methods and from different perspectives: biochemistry, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, signal transduction, among others. All this information enables the creation of large protein interaction networks – similar to metabolic or genetic/epigenetic networks – that empower the current knowledge on biochemical cascades and molecular etiology of disease, as well as the discovery of putative protein targets of therapeutic interest.\n\nIn many metabolic reactions, a protein that acts as an electron carrier binds to an enzyme that acts its reductase. After it receives an electron, it dissociates and then binds to the next enzyme that acts its oxidase (i.e. an acceptor of the electron). These interactions between proteins are dependent on highly specific binding between proteins to ensure efficient electron transfer. Examples: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain system components cytochrome c-reductase / cytochrome c / cytochrome c oxidase; microsomal and mitochondrial P450 systems.\n\nIn the case of the mitochondrial P450 systems, the specific residues involved in the binding of the electron transfer protein adrenodoxin to its reductase were identified as two basic Arg residues on the surface of the reductase and two acidic Asp residues on the adrenodoxin.\nMore recent work on the phylogeny of the reductase has shown that these residues involved in protein-protein interactions have been conserved throughout the evolution of this enzyme.\n\nThe activity of the cell is regulated by extracellular signals. Signal propagation inside and/or along the interior of cells depends on PPIs between the various signaling molecules. The recruitment of signaling pathways through PPIs is called signal transduction and plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and in many diseases including Parkinson's disease and cancer.\n\nA protein may be carrying another protein (for example, from cytoplasm to nucleus or vice versa in the case of the nuclear pore importins).\n\nIn many biosynthetic processes enzymes interact with each other to produce small compounds or other macromolecules.\n\nPhysiology of muscle contraction involves several interactions. Myosin filaments act as molecular motors and by binding to actin enables filament sliding. Furthermore, members of the skeletal muscle lipid droplet-associated proteins family associate with other proteins, as activator of adipose triglyceride lipase and its coactivator comparative gene identification-58, to regulate lipolysis in skeletal muscle \n\nThe total amount of muscle proteins in mammals, including humans, exceeds that of any other protein. About 40 percent of the body weight of a healthy human adult weighing about 70 kilograms (150 pounds) is muscle, which is composed of about 20 percent muscle protein. Thus, the human body contains about 5 to 6 kilograms (11 to 13 pounds) of muscle protein. An albumin-like fraction of these proteins, originally called myogen, contains various enzymes—phosphorylase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, and others; it does not seem to be involved in contraction. The globulin fraction contains myosin, the contractile protein, which also occurs in blood platelets, small bodies found in blood. Similar contractile substances occur in other contractile structures; for example, in the cilia or flagella (whiplike organs of locomotion) of bacteria and protozoans. In contrast to the scleroproteins, the contractile proteins are soluble in salt solutions and susceptible to enzymatic digestion.\n\nThe energy required for muscle contraction is provided by the oxidation of carbohydrates or lipids. The term \"mechanochemical reaction\" has been used for this conversion of chemical into mechanical energy. The molecular process underlying the reaction is known to involve the fibrous muscle proteins, the peptide chains of which undergo a change in conformation during contraction.\n\nMyosin, which can be removed from fresh muscle by adding it to a chilled solution of dilute potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate, is insoluble in water. Myosin, solutions of which are highly viscous, consists of an elongated—probably double-stranded—peptide chain, which is coiled at both ends in such a way that a terminal globule is formed. The length of the molecule is approximately 160 nanometres and its average diameter 2.6 nanometres. The equivalent weight of each of the two terminal globules is approximately 30,000; the molecular weight of myosin is close to 500,000. Trypsin splits myosin into large fragments called meromyosin. Myosin contains many amino acids with positively and negatively charged side chains; they form 18 and 16 percent, respectively, of the total number of amino acids. Myosin catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). A smaller protein with properties similar to those of myosin is tropomyosin. It has a molecular weight of 70,000 and dimensions of 45 by 2 nanometres. More than 90 percent of its peptide chains are present in the α-helix form.\n\nMyosin combines easily with another muscle protein called actin, the molecular weight of which is about 50,000; it forms 12 to 15 percent of the muscle proteins. Actin can exist in two forms—one, G-actin, is globular; the other, F-actin, is fibrous. Actomyosin is a complex molecule formed by one molecule of myosin and one or two molecules of actin. In muscle, actin and myosin filaments are oriented parallel to each other and to the long axis of the muscle. The actin filaments are linked to each other lengthwise by fine threads called S filaments. During contraction the S filaments shorten, so that the actin filaments slide toward each other, past the myosin filaments, thus causing a shortening of the muscle (for a detailed description of the process, \"see\" muscle: Striated muscle).\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc..\n\nTo describe the types of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) it is important to consider that proteins can interact in a \"transient\" way (to produce some specific effect in a short time, like a signal transduction) or to interact with other proteins in a \"stable\" way to form complexes that become molecular machines within the living systems. A protein complex assembly can result in the formation of homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric complexes. In addition to the conventional complexes, as enzyme-inhibitor and antibody-antigen, interactions can also be established between domain-domain and domain-peptide. Another important distinction to identify protein-protein interactions is the way they have been determined, since there are techniques that measure direct physical interactions between protein pairs, named “binary” methods, while there are other techniques that measure physical interactions among groups of proteins, without pairwise determination of protein partners, named “co-complex” methods.\n\nHomo-oligomers are macromolecular complexes constituted by only one type of protein subunit. Protein subunits assembly is guided by the establishment of non-covalent interactions in the quaternary structure of the protein. Disruption of homo-oligomers in order to return to the initial individual monomers often requires denaturation of the complex. Several enzymes, carrier proteins, scaffolding proteins, and transcriptional regulatory factors carry out their functions as homo-oligomers. \nDistinct protein subunits interact in hetero-oligomers, which are essential to control several cellular functions. The importance of the communication between heterologous proteins is even more evident during cell signaling events and such interactions are only possible due to structural domains within the proteins (as described below).\n\nStable interactions involve proteins that interact for a long time, taking part of permanent complexes as subunits, in order to carry out functional roles. These are usually the case of homo-oligomers (e.g. cytochrome c), and some hetero-oligomeric proteins, as the subunits of ATPase. On the other hand, a protein may interact briefly and in a reversible manner with other proteins in only certain cellular contexts – cell type, cell cycle stage, external factors, presence of other binding proteins, etc. – as it happens with most of the proteins involved in biochemical cascades. These are called transient interactions. For example, some G protein-coupled receptors only transiently bind to G proteins when they are activated by extracellular ligands, while some G-coupled receptors, such as muscarinic receptor M3, pre-couple with G proteins prior to the receptor-ligand binding. Interactions between intrinsically disordered protein regions to globular protein domains (i.e. MoRFs) are transient interactions.\n\nCovalent interactions are those with the strongest association and are formed by disulphide bonds or electron sharing. While rare, these interactions are determinant in some posttranslational modifications, as ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Non-covalent bonds are usually established during transient interactions by the combination of weaker bonds, such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces, or hydrophobic bonds.\n\nWater molecules play a significant role in the interactions between proteins. The crystal structures of complexes, obtained at high resolution from different but homologous proteins, have shown that some interface water molecules are conserved between homologous complexes. The majority of the interface water molecules make hydrogen bonds with both partners of each complex. Some interface amino acid residues or atomic groups of one protein partner engage in both direct and water mediated interactions with the other protein partner. Doubly indirect interactions, mediated by two water molecules, are more numerous in the homologous complexes of low affinity. Carefully conducted mutagenesis experiments, e.g. changing a tyrosine residue into a phenylalanine, have shown that water mediated interactions can contribute to the energy of interaction. Thus, water molecules may facilitate the interactions and cross-recognitions between proteins.\n\nThe molecular structures of many protein complexes have been unlocked by the technique of X-ray crystallography. The first structure to be solved by this method was that of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew. In this technique the angles and intensities of a beam of X-rays diffracted by crystalline atoms are detected in a film, thus producing a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal.\n\nLater, nuclear magnetic resonance also started to be applied with the aim of unravelling the molecular structure of protein complexes. One of the first examples was the structure of calmodulin-binding domains bound to calmodulin. This technique is based on the study of magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, thus determining physical and chemical properties of the correspondent atoms or the molecules. Nuclear magnetic resonance is advantageous for characterizing weak PPIs.\n\nProteins hold structural domains that allow their interaction with and bind to specific sequences on other proteins:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study of the molecular structure can give fine details about the interface that enables the interaction between proteins. When characterizing PPI interfaces it is important to take into account the type of complex.\n\nParameters evaluated include size (measured in absolute dimensions Å or in solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)), shape, complementarity between surfaces, residue interface propensities, hydrophobicity, segmentation and secondary structure, and conformational changes on complex formation.\n\nThe great majority of PPI interfaces reflects the composition of protein surfaces, rather than the protein cores, in spite of being frequently enriched in hydrophobic residues, particularly in aromatic residues. PPI interfaces are dynamic and frequently planar, although they can be globular and protruding as well. Based on three structures – insulin dimer, trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, and oxyhaemoglobin – Cyrus Chothia and Joel Janin found that between 1,130 and 1,720 Å of surface area was removed from contact with water indicating that hydrophobicity is a major factor of stabilization of PPIs. Later studies refined the buried surface area of the majority of interactions to 1,600±350 Å. However, much larger interaction interfaces were also observed and were associated with significant changes in conformation of one of the interaction partners. PPIs interfaces exhibit both shape and electrostatic complementarity.\n\n\nThere are a multitude of methods to detect them. Each of the approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, especially with regard to the sensitivity and specificity of the method. The most conventional and widely used high-throughput methods are yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry.\n\nThis system was firstly described in 1989 by Fields and Song using \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" as biological model. Yeast two hybrid allows the identification of pairwise PPIs (binary method) \"in vivo\", in which the two proteins are tested for biophysically direct interaction. The Y2H is based on the functional reconstitution of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and subsequent activation of a selective reporter such as His3. To test two proteins for interaction, two protein expression constructs are made: one protein (X) is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and a second protein (Y) is fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD). In the assay, yeast cells are transformed with these constructs. Transcription of reporter genes does not occur unless bait (DB-X) and prey (AD-Y) interact with each other and form a functional Gal4 transcription factor. Thus, the interaction between proteins can be inferred by the presence of the products resultant of the reporter gene expression. In cases in which the reporter gene expresses enzymes that allow the yeast to synthesize essential amino acids or nucleotides, yeast growth under selective media conditions indicates that the two proteins tested are interacting.\n\nDespite its usefulness, the yeast two-hybrid system has limitations. It uses yeast as main host system, which can be a problem when studying proteins that contain mammalian-specific post-translational modifications. The number of PPIs identified is usually low because of a high false negative rate; and, understates membrane proteins, for example.\n\nIn initial studies that utilized Y2H, proper controls for false positives (e.g. when DB-X activates the reporter gene without the presence of AD-Y) were frequently not done, leading to a higher than normal false positive rate. An empirical framework must be implemented to control for these false positives. Limitations in lower coverage of membrane proteins have been overcoming by the emergence of yeast two-hybrid variants, such as the membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) and the split-ubiquitin system, which are not limited to interactions that occur in the nucleus; and, the bacterial two-hybrid system, performed in bacteria;\n\nAffinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry mostly detects stable interactions and thus better indicates functional in vivo PPIs. This method starts by purification of the tagged protein, which is expressed in the cell usually at \"in vivo\" concentrations, and its interacting proteins (affinity purification). One of the most advantageous and widely used method to purify proteins with very low contaminating background is the tandem affinity purification, developed by Bertrand Seraphin and Matthias Mann and respective colleagues. PPIs can then be quantitatively and qualitatively analysed by mass spectrometry using different methods: chemical incorporation, biological or metabolic incorporation (SILAC), and label-free methods.\n\nThis system was first developed by LaBaer and colleagues in 2004 by using in vitro transcription and translation system. They use DNA template encoding the gene of interest fused with GST protein, and it was immobilized in the solid surface. Anti-GST antibody and biotinylated plasmid DNA were bounded in aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-coated slide. BSA can improve the binding efficiency of DNA. Biotinylated plasmid DNA was bound by avidin. New protein was synthesized by using cell-free expression system i.e. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), and then the new protein was captured through anti-GST antibody bounded on the slide. To test protein-protein interaction, the targeted protein cDNA and query protein cDNA were immobilized in a same coated slide. By using in vitro transcription and translation system, targeted and query protein was synthesized by the same extract. The targeted protein was bound to array by antibody coated in the slide and query protein was used to probe the array. The query protein was tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Thus, the interaction between the two proteins was visualized with the antibody against HA.\n\nDiverse techniques to identify PPIs have been emerging along with technology progression. These include co-immunoprecipitation, protein microarrays, analytical ultracentrifugation, light scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (LUMIER), resonance-energy transfer systems, mammalian protein–protein interaction trap, electro-switchable biosurfaces, protein-fragment complementation assay, as well as real-time label-free measurements by surface plasmon resonance, and calorimetry.\n\nThe experimental detection and characterization of PPIs is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, many PPIs can be also predicted computationally, usually using experimental data as a starting point. However, methods have also been developed that allow the prediction of PPI de novo, that is without prior evidence for these interactions.\n\n\"The Rosetta Stone or Domain Fusion method\" is based on the hypothesis that interacting proteins are sometimes fused into a single protein in another genome. Therefore, we can predict if two proteins may be interacting by determining if they each have non-overlapping sequence similarity to a region of a single protein sequence in another genome.\n\n\"The Conserved Neighborhood method\" is based on the hypothesis that if genes encoding two proteins are neighbors on a chromosome in many genomes, then they are likely functionally related (and possibly physically interacting)\".\"\n\n\"The Phylogenetic Profile method\" is based on the hypothesis that if two or more proteins are concurrently present or absent across several genomes, then they are likely functionally related. Therefore, potentially interacting proteins can be identified by determining the presence or absence of genes across many genomes and selecting those genes which are always present or absent together.\n\nPublicly available information from biomedical documents is readily accessible through the internet and is becoming a powerful resource for collecting known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), PPI prediction and protein docking. Text mining is much less costly and time-consuming compared to other high-throughput techniques. Currently, text mining methods generally detect binary relations between interacting proteins from individual sentences using rule/pattern-based information extraction and machine learning approaches. A wide variety of text mining applications for PPI extraction and/or prediction are available for public use, as well as repositories which often store manually validated and/or computationally predicted PPIs. Text mining can be implemented in two stages: \"information retrieval\", where texts containing names of either or both interacting proteins are retrieved and \"information extraction,\" where targeted information (interacting proteins, implicated residues, interaction types, etc.) is extracted.\n\nThere are also studies using phylogenetic profiling, basing their functionalities on the theory that proteins involved in common pathways co-evolve in a correlated fashion across species. Some more complex text mining methodologies use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and build knowledge networks (for example, considering gene names as nodes and verbs as edges). Other developments involve kernel methods to predict protein interactions.\n\nThese methods use machine learning to distinguish how interacting protein pairs differ from non-interacting protein pairs in terms of pairwise features such as cellular colocalization, gene co-expression, how closely located on a DNA are the genes that encode the two proteins, and so on. Random Forest has been found to be most-effective machine learning method for protein interaction prediction. Such methods have been applied for discovering protein interactions on human interactome, specifically the interactome of Membrane proteins and the interactome of Schizophrenia-associated proteins.\n\nLarge scale identification of PPIs generated hundreds of thousands of interactions, which were collected together in specialized biological databases that are continuously updated in order to provide complete interactomes. The first of these databases was the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). Since that time, the number of public databases has been increasing. Databases can be subdivided into primary databases, meta-databases, and prediction databases.\n\n\"Primary databases\" collect information about published PPIs proven to exist via small-scale or large-scale experimental methods. Examples: DIP, Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND), Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), IntAct Molecular Interaction Database, Molecular Interactions Database (MINT), MIPS Protein Interaction Resource on Yeast (MIPS-MPact), and MIPS Mammalian Protein–Protein Interaction Database (MIPS-MPPI).\n\n\"Meta-databases\" normally result from the integration of primary databases information, but can also collect some original data. Examples: Agile Protein Interactomes Dataserver (APID), The Microbial Protein Interaction Database (MPIDB), Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) platform, (GPS-Prot), and Wiki-Pi.\n\n\"Prediction databases\" include many PPIs that are predicted using several techniques (main article). Examples: Human Protein–Protein Interaction Prediction Database (PIPs), Interlogous Interaction Database (I2D), Known and Predicted Protein–Protein Interactions (STRING-db), and Unified Human Interactive (UniHI).\n\nThe aforementioned computational methods all depend on source databases whose data can be extrapolated to predict novel protein-protein interactions\". Coverage\" differs greatly between databases. In general, primary databases have the fewest total protein interactions recorded as they do not integrate data from multiple other databases, while prediction databases have the most because they include other forms of evidence in addition to experimental. For example, the primary database IntAct has 572,063 interactions, the meta-database APID has 678,000 interactions, and the predictive database STRING has 25,914,693 interactions. However, it is important to note that some of the interactions in the STRING database are only predicted by computational methods such as Genomic Context and not experimentally verified.\n\nInformation found in PPIs databases supports the construction of interaction networks. Although the PPI network of a given query protein can be represented in textbooks, diagrams of whole cell PPIs are frankly complex and difficult to generate.\n\nOne example of a manually produced molecular interaction map is the Kurt Kohn's 1999 map of cell cycle control. Drawing on Kohn's map, Schwikowski et al. in 2000 published a paper on PPIs in yeast, linking 1,548 interacting proteins determined by two-hybrid screening. They used a layered graph drawing method to find an initial placement of the nodes and then improved the layout using a force-based algorithm.\n\nBioinformatic tools have been developed to simplify the difficult task of visualizing molecular interaction networks and complement them with other types of data. For instance, Cytoscape is an open-source software widely used and lots of plugins are currently available. Pajek software is advantageous for the visualization and analysis of very large networks.\n\nIdentification of functional modules in PPI networks is an important challenge in bioinformatics. Functional modules means a set of proteins that are highly connected to each other in PPI network. It is almost similar problem as community detection in social networks. There are some methods such as Jactive modules and MoBaS. Jactive modules integrate PPI network and gene expression data where as MoBaS integrate PPI network and Genome Wide association Studies.\n\nThe awareness of the major roles of PPIs in numerous physiological and pathological processes has been driving the challenge of unravel many interactomes. Examples of published interactomes are the thyroid specific DREAM interactome and the PP1α interactome in human brain.\n\nProtein-protein relationships are often the result of multiple types of interactions or are deduced from different approaches, including co-localization, direct interaction, suppressive genetic interaction, additive genetic interaction, physical association, and other associations.\n\nProtein–protein interactions often result in one of the interacting proteins either being 'activated' or 'repressed'. Such effects can be indicated in a PPI network by \"signs\" (e.g. \"activation\" or \"inhibition\"). Although such attributes have been added to networks for a long time, Vinayagam et al. (2014) coined the term \"Signed network\" for them. Signed networks are often expressed by labeling the interaction as either positive or negative. A positive interaction is one where the interaction results in one of the proteins being activated. Conversely a negative interaction indicates that one of the proteins being inactivated.\n\nProtein–protein interaction networks are often constructed as a result of lab experiments such as yeast two hybrid screens or 'affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry techniques. However these methods do not provide the layer of information needed in order to determine what type of interaction is present in order to be able to attribute signs to the network diagrams.\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) screens (repression of individual proteins between transcription and translation) are one method that can be utilized in the process of providing signs to the protein-protein interactions. Individual proteins are repressed and the resulting phenotypes are analyzed. A correlating phenotypic relationship (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in the same phenotype) indicates a positive, or activating relationship. Phenotypes that do not correlate (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in two different phenotypes) indicate a negative or inactivating relationship. If protein A is dependent on protein B for activation then the inhibition of either protein A or B will result in a cell losing the service that is provided by protein A and the phenotypes will be the same for the inhibition of either A or B. If, however, protein A is inactivated by protein B then the phenotypes will differ depending on which protein is inhibited (inhibit protein B and it can no longer inactivate protein A leaving A active however inactivate A and there is nothing for B to activate since A is inactive and the phenotype changes). Multiple RNAi screens need to be performed in order to reliably appoint a sign to a given protein-protein interaction. Vinayagam et al. who devised this technique state that a minimum of nine RNAi screens are required with confidence increasing as one carries out more screens.\nModulation of PPI is challenging and is receiving increasing attention by the scientific community. Several properties of PPI such as allosteric sites and hotspots, have been incorporated into drug-design strategies. The relevance of PPI as putative therapeutic targets for the development of new treatments is particularly evident in cancer, with several ongoing clinical trials within this area.\nThe consensus among these promising targets is, nonetheless, denoted in the already available drugs on the market to treat a multitude of diseases. Examples are Tirobifan, inhibitor of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, used as a cardiovascular drug, and Maraviroc, inhibitor of the CCR5-gp120 interaction, used as anti-HIV drug.\nRecently, Amit Jaiswal and others were able to develop 30 peptides using protein–protein interaction studies to inhibit telomerase recruitment towards telomeres.\n\n"}

Rumbeke Castle is situated at an altitude of 25 meters.\n\nAlthough most of the building was built during the Renaissance period, on the site of a far older fortress, it gained some slightly Neoclassical features after its renovation during the 18th century. During those renovations, the adjacent forest, the Sterrebos or the Star Forest, was added to its grounds. The forest was modelled after the Prater park in Vienna.\n\nAccording to legend, Baldwin Iron Arm, Count of Flanders, kidnapped Judith, the daughter of Charles the Bald in 862 in Senlis and brought her to the fortress that used to be at the very location where the present castle now stands. With the intervention of the Pope, the two lovers married in Auxerre, which then resulted in the creation of the County of Flanders.\nFor centuries, the castle was owned by the counts of Thiennes and Limburg Stirum. The castle of Rumbeke suffered damage during the invasion of Flanders by French king Louis XIV, as well as during the French Revolution and in both world wars more than a century later. In fact, during World War I, it was taken over by the Germans and became for a short period of time, the home of Baron Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the Red Baron, who was credited with shooting down 80 enemy aircraft in his brightly painted red airplane.\n\nThe castle can be seen in the movie \"That Lucky Touch\", a comedy which was partially shot in Rumbeke in 1975, starring Roger Moore and Shelley Winters.\n\n"}

It thus continued the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Nansen in 1921. The League also provided the administrative expenses for the Nansen Office though only for fees charged for the Nansen passport since its revenues for welfare and relief were obtained from private contributions. \n\nThe organization was to supply material and political support to refugees. For refugees from the Third Reich or from the civil war-torn Spain, the Nansen aid was not applicable, though many countries refused to accept the refugees. \n\nIn spite of such problems, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization in 1938 for its work, but due to its dissolution shortly afterwards, the prize money was received by a newly founded refugee organization of the League of Nations. The office was dissolved at the same time as the League dissolved the High Commission (established in 1933) because of the problems surrounding German refugees after the dissolution of the Third Reich.\n\nThe Nansen Office accomplished numerous tasks while it existed. \n\nThe Office was responsible for the adoption by fourteen countries of the 1933 Refugee Convention which was a modest charter of human rights.\n\nThe Nansen Office was instrumental in finding shelter in specially constructed houses in villages in Syria and Lebanon for 40,000 Armenians, after the resettlement of another 10,000 in Yerevan. \n\nThe Nansen International Office for Refugees was responsible for the successful settlement of the Saar refugees in Paraguay after 1935.\n\nThe Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the 1938 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to establish the Nansen passports.\n\n\n"}

He says that the community is related to the Kamboj Rajput community mainly located in northern India and eastern Pakistan.\n\nIshtiaq Ahmed, a political scientist who is also a member of the Arain community, acknowledges that some early Arain texts ascribe a Suryavanshi Rajput origin, while others note a Persian one to reflect to others the status of being “conquerers”. He believes that the Arains \"are a mix of many ethnicities and races\", similar to other \"farming castes of the Punjab and Haryana\".\n\nAccording to Ahmed, during the Mughal and Sikh periods some Arains held prominent positions, such as governors and army generals; he also believes that numerous names adopted by the community may indicate a tradition of military employment. \n\nAt the end of the period of governance mostly by the British East India Company, the rebel leaders of the 1857 uprising included Shah Abdul Qadir Ludhianvi, whose actions with fellow Arains were in part why the authorities of the newly-created British Raj subsequently considered the tribe to be dangerous, leading to them being denied recruitment to the army and having lands confiscated. This treatment was also applied to many other of the rebellious communities. \n\nLater, in Lahore District of British India, the Arain were the main Muslim landowning group among those located close to the urban areas, whilst Jats held a similar position in the rural areas. When the British wanted land developed in the Punjab Province, the Arain were brought in to cultivate lands around the cities, and were one of the agricultural communities given preference to assist with the opening up of the agrarian frontier in the Canal Colonies between 1885 and 1940.\n\nTraditionally associated with farming, Shahid Javed Burki says that the British favoured the Arain for their \"hard work, frugality and sense of discipline\". Subsequent development of towns and cities and increasing urbanisation resulted in the value of the land settled by Arain to rise significantly, and Arain families thus flourished. Education was prioritised with the new-found wealth and the Arain came to dominate the legal profession amongst urban Punjabi Muslims. Many used law to enter politics.\n\nAlthough at first denied entry to the British Indian Army following the events of 1857, in the early 20th century the Arain were classified by the Raj as an \"agricultural tribe\", which was then effectively synonymous with the \"martial race\" classification.\n\nSeveral meetings were held to establish an organisation to represent the Arain community in the 1890s. Eventually, in 1915, Anjuman Ra’iyan-i-Hind emerged as such a body in Lahore and a national community newspaper, titled \"Al-Rai\", was established. \n\nThe Arains are in majority in Lahore and this biradari is also active in industrial and commercial activities. A few families play a significant role in the politics of Lahore at national and local level.\n\nThere are several diasporic Arain communities in British towns and cities, such as Manchester and Oxford. The tribe has its own organisation, Arain Council UK, which was established as Anjuman-e-Arains in the 1980s and renamed in 2008.\n\n"}

At school in Tokyo, he attended political lectures and demonstrated in support of the suffrage movement in 1920. As a result of his father's position, he had the chance to hear Prime Minister Hara Takashi's opposition to extending the franchise. Angry against the politicians, he became more critical of his father's role and felt that some direct action was necessary. \nHe began reading the works of Marx and Lenin as well as leftist magazines.

{"id": "2161913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161913", "title": "Proctitis", "text": "Proctitis\n\nProctitis is an inflammation of the anus and the lining of the rectum, affecting only the last 6 inches of the rectum.\n\nA common symptom is a continual urge to have a bowel movement—the rectum could feel full or have constipation. Another is tenderness and mild irritation in the rectum and anal region. A serious symptom is pus and blood in the discharge, accompanied by cramps and pain during the bowel movement. If there is severe bleeding, anemia can result, showing symptoms such as pale skin, irritability, weakness, dizziness, brittle nails, and shortness of breath.\n\nSymptoms are ineffectual straining to empty the bowels, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and possible discharge, a feeling of not having adequately emptied the bowels, involuntary spasms and cramping during bowel movements, left-sided abdominal pain, passage of mucus through the rectum, and anorectal pain.\n\nGonorrhea \n\nChlamydia \n\nHerpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 \n\nSyphilis \n\nProctitis has many possible causes. It may occur idiopathically (idiopathic proctitis, that is, arising spontaneously or from an unknown cause). Other causes include damage by irradiation (for example in radiation therapy for cervical cancer and prostate cancer) or as a sexually transmitted infection, as in lymphogranuloma venereum and herpes proctitis. Studies suggest a celiac disease-associated \"proctitis\" can result from an intolerance to gluten.\n\nA common cause is engaging in anal sex with partner(s) infected with sexual transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men. Shared enema usage has been shown to facilitate the spread of Lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis.\n\nDoctors can diagnose proctitis by looking inside the rectum with a proctoscope or a sigmoidoscope. A biopsy is taken, in which the doctor scrapes a tiny piece of tissue from the rectum, and this tissue is then examined by microscopy. The physician may also take a stool sample to test for infections or bacteria. If the physician suspects that the patient has Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, colonoscopy or barium enema X-rays are used to examine areas of the intestine.\n\nTreatment for proctitis varies depending on severity and the cause. For example, the physician may prescribe antibiotics for proctitis caused by bacterial infection. If the proctitis is caused by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the physician may prescribe the drug 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5ASA) or corticosteroids applied directly to the area in enema or suppository form, or taken orally in pill form. Enema and suppository applications are usually more effective, but some patients may require a combination of oral and rectal applications.\n\nAnother treatment available is that of fiber supplements such as Metamucil. Taken daily these may restore regularity and reduce pain associated with proctitis.\n\nChronic radiation proctitis is usually treated first-line with sucralfate enemas. These are non-invasive and are effective in diffuse, distal disease. Other treatments may include mesalamine suppositories, vitamin E, hyperbaric oxygen, or short chain fatty acid enemas; however these treatments are only supported by observational or anecdotal evidence. \n\n\n"}

They settled on a farm near Kemptville, Ontario. Oostrom moved to Toronto in 1955 to study at the University of Toronto, and graduated in 1959 with a BA. He subsequently earned a Master of Business Administration degree and entered the business world as a financial analyst. By the late 1970s, he had become an executive with the electronics firm, Phillips Canada.\n\nHe was a member of Paul Hellyer's short-lived Action Canada Party in 1971, and followed Hellyer into the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada when Action Canada dissolved prior to the 1972 federal election. In that election, Oostrom was the Progressive Conservative (PC) candidate in the working-class Toronto riding of York South. He placed third behind New Democratic Party leader David Lewis and the Liberal candidate.\n\nIn the 1979 federal election, Oostrom ran again in what had become York South—Weston. This time he came in second, only 3,500 votes behind Liberal incumbent Ursula Appolloni. A third attempt by Oostrom in the 1980 election was less successful. He came third with only half as many votes as the Liberal victor.\n\nOostrom was successful in his fourth campaign, in the 1984 federal election when he moved to the more affluent riding of Willowdale in North York. This time, Oostrom won, edging Liberal Member of Parliament Jim Peterson by just over 400 votes.\n\nAs a Progressive Conservative backbencher in the House of Commons of Canada, Oostrom was a social conservative, opposing abortion and favouring capital punishment and a hard law and order stance. As vice chair of the House of Common's committee responsible for immigration, Oostrom also expressed criticism of what he saw as lax policies towards refugee claimants. Oostrom is also a fervent anti-Communist and was also involved with the far-right World Anti-Communist League.\n\nIn the 1988 federal election, Oostrom again faced Peterson, who beat him by fewer than 2,000 votes. Oostrom returned to the private sector as a consultant before trying to regain his Willowdale seat as a PC Party candidate in the 1993 federal election. He was unsuccessful, garnering only 7,733 votes against Peterson's 28,000 and winning only 700 votes more than the third place Reform Party candidate.\n\nOostrom attempted another comeback in the 2000 federal election, this time in the suburban 905 riding of Oak Ridges north of Toronto. Running again as a Progressive Conservative, he came in a poor third.\n\nIn 2003, Oostrom added his voice to those Tories opposing the Progressive Conservative Party's merger with the Canadian Alliance.\n"}

Although Wintergreen lacked Slade's superhuman physical attributes, he possessed far more combat experience and thus acted as Wilson's mentor.\n\nA re-imagined version of the character appeared on The CW's live-action television series \"Arrow\" in the first season, where he was portrayed by stunt performer Jeffrey C. Robinson as the show's first incarnation of Deathstroke. He returned in the final season as well. He is also featured on the DC Universe series \"Titans\", played by Demore Barnes.\n\nCreated by George Pérez and Marv Wolfman, William Randolph Wintergreen was introduced to the DC Universe in \"New Teen Titans\" #2 (December 1980) as the butler of Deathstroke the Terminator.\n\nWilliam Randolph Wintergreen grew up in Oxford, England. At university, he avoided sports and squirreled himself away in the library, which was open to him due to his father's title. He possessed strong research skills, and knowing the conduits through which information flowed later aided him in his work with MI5. Wintergreen met Sergeant Slade Wilson during his time at the British Army, and the two developed a close friendship. When General Sampson sent Slade on a suicide mission, Wintergreen, now a member of the Special Air Service, rescued Slade from perishing in an explosion, while Sampson was given a minor reprimand. Wintergreen served as Slade's best man when the latter married his captain, Adeline Kane. Still holding a grudge for Wintergreen's disobedience, Sampson later sent Wintergreen on a suicide mission. Slade commandeered a plane and made his way to Hanoi, where he freed Wintergreen from a Viet Cong prison. Slade then revealed to Wintergreen that his physical attributes had been enhanced by a military experiment. Slade was subsequently discharged for disobeying orders to save Wintergreen.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Slade secretly began operating as the mercenary \"Deathstroke\". When Slade's occupation resulted in an accident involving their son, Joseph Wilson, Adeline divorced Slade and left with their children. Wintergreen then became Slade's butler and mentor, acting as his moral conscience, comrade in arms and medic. Wintergreen also began cataloguing Slade's adventures in journal entries. Slade took up hunting in Africa for a brief time, with Wintergreen at his side. Slade eventually returned to his mercenary ways, and Wintergreen continued to catalogue his missions. Slade later discovered that he had a daughter named Rose Wilson. Fearing that he would not be a good father, Slade left Rose in the care of Wintergreen, who grew to care very much for her and was even prepared to adopt her, though Rose ultimately joined the Teen Titans.\n\nWhen Slade was later caught in an explosion, he retired and cut ties with both Pat Trayce and Wintergreen, claiming that they were no longer part of his life. Despite suspecting that this explosion actually restored Slade's memory (since details of his past life crept up in idle conversation), Wintergreen knew that Slade had his reasons for distancing himself, and thus respected this unspoken request from his student by giving him his space. In Slade's absence, Trayce and Wintergreen honoured him by continuing to run Vigilance, Inc. (a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organisation by Adeline).\n\nSometime later, Slade discovered that Joseph's spirit had taken refuge deep within his body. With the help of Wintergreen, he attempted to exorcise his son from himself, but was quickly overpowered. The possessed Slade then seemingly murdered Wintergreen, mounting his severed head on a wall as he vowed that \"Deathstroke hunts alone\". Before his death, Wintergreen had apparently believed that he would inevitably be murdered by Slade, evidenced by his last words, \"I suppose it was only a matter of time\". Slade would forever be haunted by his mentor's dying words.\n\nDuring the \"Blackest Night\" storyline, Wintergreen was revived by a Black Lantern Ring, and went back to haunt Deathstroke with Adeline Wilson and the Ravagers as members of the Black Lantern Corps.\n\nWintergreen returns in the DC Rebirth relaunch, once again serving as an ally of Deathstroke from his time in the army.\n\nWintergreen has received extensive training in military protocols and espionage, making him a proficient hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. He has also proven an exceptionally skilled marksman in the use of various firearms.\n\n\n\n\n\nDC Collectibles has released a 6.75-inch action figure of Bill Wintergreen's Deathstroke in a two-pack with Oliver Queen, based on their respective appearances in the first season of the TV show \"Arrow\".\n\n"}

Security around the Embassy is extremely rigorous, and photography of the building is prohibited.\n\nThe Embassy occupies a house originally built in 1860–62 for the author William Makepeace Thackeray, constructed in red brick at his request. It was granted Grade II* listed status in 1969.\n\nOn 19 September 1972, a letter bomb delivered to the Embassy exploded, killing c, an Israeli diplomat. Seven other bombs claimed to have been sent by the terrorist group Black September were either not delivered, or detected.\n\nOn 3 June 1982, Ambassador of Israel Shlomo Argov was shot and seriously injured on departing an event at the Dorchester Hotel where he was guest of honour. A terror cell claiming to have split from the PLO and headed by Abu Nidal took credit for the attack. After a lengthy coma, the Ambassador died of his wounds in 2003. The incident is widely reported as being a key factor in the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nOn 26 July 1994, a car bomb exploded outside the Embassy, partially destroying the front of the building and injuring 20 people within and outside the building. The blast damaged shops on nearby Kensington High Street, and blew out windows in Kensington Palace. The attack came a day after the leaders of Israel and Jordan had met for peace talks and eight days after the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires. Thirteen hours after the attack on the embassy another bomb exploded outside a Jewish charity building in north London, injuring six people. Five Palestinians resident in London were arrested in January 1995 in connection with the bombings and two – Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami – were sentenced to 20 years in jail for their role in the attacks.\n\nA series of demonstrations outside the Embassy during December 2008 and January 2009, held in protest at Israel's \"Cast Lead\" operation in Gaza, were marred by violence and ended in a number of arrests and at least one court sentence for those taking part in the violence.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, Ambassador of Israel Ron Prosor formally announced the re-dedication of the Embassy after an extensive refurbishment programme. As part of the Embassy's re-dedication, the original Music Room of the Thackeray house was named in honour of late Ambassador Shlomo Argov.\n\n\n"}

Okroshka is usually garnished with sour cream (smetana). Later versions that first appeared in Soviet times use light or diluted kefir, whey, vinegar, or mineral water instead of kvass.\n\nThe ingredients are diced and then mixed with kvass just before eating; the ratio of chopped food to kvass is similar to that of cereal to milk. This allows the vegetables to retain their texture. For that same reason, even though the ingredients are similar to those in a Russian salad, the taste of okroshka is quite different from that of the salad.\n\nOkroshka is mostly served in summer because the soup combines the refreshing taste of kvass and the lightness of a salad. Salt and sugar can be added according to taste. In the recipes with mineral water, there is one more addition to the ingredients of okroshka: freshly squeezed lemon juice. It adds that extra savor to the recipes without kvass and makes this dish so mouthwatering. \n\nOkroshka is always served cold. Sometimes ice cubes are added to served portions to keep the soup cold in hot weather.\n\n\n\n"}

A direct sequel to \"SSX\", the game was released in 2001 for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox and was later ported to the Game Boy Advance in October 2002.\n\nGameplay continues the same basic method introduced in \"SSX\", with the main tracks being 'remixed' from the previous games and two new tracks, Garibaldi and Alaska. The important new feature added to the series are the Uber moves. If players are able to fill their boost bar to the maximum, they will be able to perform Uber moves which involve characters taking their feet off their board and doing over the top moves. If a player successfully lands an Uber move, they are given a short amount of time for infinite boost, which can be topped off by performing more Uber moves. Each player can perform five Uber moves, including a personal move if the character is using a board that matches their style. If a player successfully performs six Uber moves, spelling out 'tricky' on the boost bar, they will have infinite boost for the remainder of the level.\n\nAlso introduced in the game is a rivalry system in the World Circuit mode. If the player is friendly with another AI character, they will treat the player favourably. However, if the player ends up annoying other AI characters, generally by attacking them during the race in order to fill the adrenaline bar, they will become hostile towards players in future events.\n\nThere are four modes of gameplay.\n\n\nPeter Suclu reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"If you haven't played \"SSX\", this is a must-buy, but if you already own the game, the full-price 'expansion pack' is hardly revolutionary.\"\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"universal acclaim\", and the GameCube and Xbox versions received \"favorable\" reviews, while the Game Boy Advance version received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nMost reviews hesitated before calling the game a \"true sequel\" since it shared a large amount of content with the original \"SSX\" (all but two of the courses appear in the original). Reviews did compliment the added features, such as \"Uber tricks\" and \"Rivalry\" with other boarders. Some reviewers thought that the improvements over the original were so good that \"SSX Tricky\" was billed as the best snowboarding game to date. The voice acting was highly praised by many reviewers, noting that the use of celebrities such as Lucy Liu helped bring the outrageous characters to life. The music system received much acclaim as it was able to adapt to suit the situation. Each course had specific songs paired with it to match the mood and when riders reached maximum boost or were knocked down, the music reacts. The size of the environments, the detail of the graphics and the trick system also received plenty of recognition from reviewers. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 32 out of 40 for the GameCube version, 30 out of 40 for the PS2 version, and three sevens and one eight (29/40) for the Xbox version.\n\nIn predicting the sales for the game, PSX Extreme said \"It's quite unfortunate if I do say so myself, because a AAA title like \"SSX Tricky\" won't be getting the sales it really deserves.\" IGN called it the 95th best PlayStation 2 game. The staff cited its improvements over its predecessor (which includes \"flashier Uber moves\").\n"}

He went 12–5 with a 2.05 earned run average with the Winter Haven Mets in , and seemed well on his way to the majors when was called to take a draft physical in Puerto Rico. After three weeks away from his team, the Raleigh-Durham Mets, he hurt his arm in his first game back. The Mets released him, and Figueroa joined the United States Marine Corps, spending the next year in Vietnam.\n\nUpon his discharge from the Marine Corps in , Figueroa signed with the San Francisco Giants. After three seasons in their organization, he was traded to the California Angels for Bruce Christensen and Don Rose on July 6, .\n\nFigueroa made his major league debut on April 9, 1974. After Nolan Ryan had given up three runs to the Texas Rangers, he was replaced in the second inning with the bases loaded and no outs. Skip Lockwood struck out the first batter he faced, then gave up a grand slam to Jeff Burroughs. The Angels were already behind 10–2 when Figueroa was called into the game in the eighth inning. He gave up one hit in two innings.\n\nOn July 6, Figueroa pitched a complete game in which he only gave up one earned run while striking out six with six hits. He received no run support from his team, and his first decision was a 1–0 loss to Cleveland. His next start was also a complete game. This time he received run support, and shut out the Boston Red Sox, 7–0, at Fenway Park. The 1974 Angels were a last place team which lost 94. Figueroa ended up with a 2–8 record despite a solid 3.67 ERA.\n\nAfter splitting 1974 between starts and relief appearances, Figueroa was added to the starting rotation for .

He joined a Yankees pitching staff that included Catfish Hunter and Dock Ellis, yet it was Figueroa who turned out to be the staff ace, going 19–10 with a 3.02 ERA to finish fourth in American League Cy Young Award balloting behind Jim Palmer, Mark Fidrych and former California teammate Frank Tanana in .\n\nFigueroa's numbers tailed off slightly in 1977, as he went 16–11 with a 3.57 ERA for the 1977 World Series champions.

Its GRAU designation is \"3M6\" and its NATO reporting name is AT-1 Snapper.\n\nToo large to be manportable, it was typically deployed from specialised vehicles or helicopters. The missile was intended to supplement traditional anti-tank weapons, like the 100 mm anti-tank gun whose accuracy beyond 1,500 m is poor. The missile's accuracy in contrast remained high as far as its maximum range of 2,000 m.\n\nHowever, the system's bulk, slow speed and poor combat accuracy drove development of later SACLOS systems, like the AT-5 Spandrel.\n\nThe 3M6 \"Shmel\" was based on the western ATGMs of the time, such as the Nord Aviation SS.10; however, it is considerably larger. It was developed by the Special Mortar Design Bureau (SKB Gladkostvolnoi Artillery) in Kolomna, who were also responsible for the AT-3 Sagger.\n\nDevelopment of the missile proceeded rapidly, with the first unguided flights in April 1958 followed by controlled flights in June and July 1958. On 28 August 1959, the new technology was shown to the command of armed forces. On 1 August 1960, it was accepted into the service. It was first publicly displayed in 1963.\n\nThere were two ground-based platforms for the missile\nThese vehicles were deployed in anti-tank batteries attached to motor rifle regiments. Each battery has three platoons, each with three launch vehicles and a single command BRDM.\n\nWhile a few were used by Egyptian forces during the 1967 Six-Day War and from 1969 in the War of Attrition, only one tank loss was attributed to the system. The system's hit probability is estimated to have been 25% in combat.\n\nThe system was also used by the Cypriot National Guard during the 1974 Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in a man-portable version. Several dozen shots were fired in action during a number of July and August engagements in the conflict, with low effectiveness.\n\nNorth Korea began producing a reverse-engineered version of the missile in 1975.\n\nThe missile is guided to the target by means of a joystick, which requires some skill on the part of the operator. The operator's adjustments are transmitted to the missile via a thin wire that trails behind the missile.\n\nThe missile is steered by an unconventional arrangement of vibrating spoilers.\n\nAs stated before, MCLOS requires considerable skill on the part of the operator. The system's effectiveness in combat drove the development of missiles based on the easier to use SACLOS system.\n\nOne problem with the missile is the amount of time it takes to reach maximum range—around 20 seconds—giving the intended target time to take action, either by retreating behind an obstacle, laying down a smoke screen or firing on the operator. Also, the large size of the missile means that only a few rounds can be carried; the BRDM-1 vehicle can only carry three missiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The award was given to \"White Christmas\".\n\nDe Paul collaborated with Johnny Mercer, Don Raye, Carolyn Leigh, Charles Rinker and others at Universal Studios, Walt Disney Studios and other Hollywood companies.\n\nDe Paul composed the 1953 hit song \"Teach Me Tonight\".\n\nDe Paul was one of the composers of the songs and dances, along with lyricist Johnny Mercer, for the 1954 musical film \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" for which he was nominated for the 1983 Tony Award for Best Original Score.\n\nHe was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nGene de Paul died in 1988 and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2161961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161961", "title": "Magnum (band)", "text": "Magnum (band)\n\nMagnum are an English hard rock band. They were formed in Birmingham by Tony Clarkin (guitar, songwriter) and Bob Catley (vocals) in order to appear as the resident band at the Rum Runner nightclub in the city. Magnum have undergone several changes in personnel over the years; however, the core of Catley and Clarkin remain.\n\nMagnum's most significant early success was \"Chase the Dragon\" in 1982, which reached number 17 in the UK Albums Chart. It included several songs that would become mainstays of the band's live set, notably \"Soldier of the Line\", \"Sacred Hour\" and \"The Spirit\". \"On a Storyteller's Night\" gave the band its breakthrough in Europe, and achieved a Gold certification in the United Kingdom. The band's 1986 album \"Vigilante\" represented a further move towards the mainstream before the band achieved their commercial peak in 1988 when they entered the UK Top Ten for the first time with the album \"Wings of Heaven\", which reached number five and featured three Top 40 singles, \"Days of No Trust\", \"Start Talking Love\" and \"It Must Have Been Love\". It was followed by \"Goodnight L.A.\", which was produced by Keith Olsen and reached number nine in the UK Album Chart in 1990. It produced another Top 40 single for the band, \"Rockin' Chair\".\n\nIn 1995, Clarkin announced Magnum's split; he later formed another band, with Catley and Al Barrow called Hard Rain. Magnum reformed in 2001 and has enjoyed late-career commercial success. Their most recent album, \"The Serpent Rings\", was released in January 2020.\n\nMagnum began as the house band at Birmingham's famous Rum Runner night club (later the home of Duran Duran). Joining Clarkin and Catley were drummer Kex Gorin (born Kevin Gorin, 1 January 1949, Birmingham died 21 December 2007) and bassist Bob Doyle. The band line up remained the same until 1972, when Les Kitcheridge joined temporarily on guitar. Bob Doyle left Magnum in 1972 and joined Roy Wood's Wizzard, and was replaced by former Uglys and Balls bassist Dave Morgan (later a member of ELO). Morgan commented:\n\nThey began to develop their own style by playing Clarkin's songs at a residency at The Railway Inn, in Birmingham's Curzon Street, in 1976. In 1975, Clarkin and Dave Morgan received an offer from Kim Holmes to help with the construction of a studio, rather than being paid with money, Clarkin requested to be paid with studio time. Much of Magnum's early demo material was recorded at Nest Studios in Birmingham, which would later lead to a recording contract with David Arden of Jet Records. During the \"Nest\" sessions, at least two songs written by Dave Morgan (and sung by Bob Catley) were recorded but never released. The titles were \"Baby I Need\" and \"One More Round The Bend\", which resurfaced on an acetate disc in 2005.\n\nA one off deal with CBS was arranged via producer Roger Greenaway, and the band released a cover of The Searchers' \"Sweets for My Sweet\" in February 1975; however, this failed to make the charts. The original recording included a medley of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" but was edited out for the single release. Lead vocals on this song were by Morgan, who left the band soon after, and was replaced by Colin \"Wally\" Lowe. Success was still minimal; they were working as a backing band for artists, such as Del Shannon, on small tours. The band was expanded to a five-piece with the addition of Richard Bailey on keyboards. In May 1977 the band supported Judas Priest on their \"Sin After Sin\" UK tour, still without the backing of a record label.\n\nMagnum's debut album \"Kingdom of Madness\" was released on Jet Records at the end of 1978 and reached #58 in the UK Chart; it received a five star review from Geoff Barton of \"Sounds magazine\". They toured the UK in October/November 1978, as support to David Coverdale's Whitesnake. Leo Lyons, formerly bassist with Ten Years After, produced the follow-up album \"Magnum II –\" which was released in 1979, but failed to chart. Another support tour was organised for November 1979, this time with Blue Öyster Cult. A live set, \"Marauder\", was released as an album and reached #34 in the UK, and a live double single (\"Live at the Marquee\", including \"Invasion\") reached #48 in the UK Singles Chart. Bailey departed soon after and was replaced temporarily by Grenville Harding during Magnum's support of Def Leppard's \"On Through the Night\" UK tour in March. For the second leg in April, permanent replacement Mark Stanway took over keyboard duties. Magnum also appeared at the Reading Festival in 1980. April 1981 saw another support tour, this time with Tygers of Pan Tang on their \"Spellbound\" UK tour.\n\nTheir first successful album was the Jeff Glixman produced \"Chase the Dragon\" (1982), which reached #17 in the UK, and included several songs that would be mainstays of the band's live set, including \"Soldier of the Line\", \"Sacred Hour\" and \"The Spirit\". Glixman was previously known for his work with Kansas, and this was the first Magnum release to feature the artwork of fantasy artist Rodney Matthews. The tour included a support slot in February with Krokus, on their \"One Vice at a Time\" UK tour. A few United States dates were played during the summer of 1982, supporting labelmate Ozzy Osbourne – these would ultimately prove to be the only live gigs the band ever played outside Europe. The band returned to the UK in July for their own headlining tour.\n\nBudgetary constraints at Jet denied Magnum the use of an outside producer for 1983's Clarkin-produced \"The Eleventh Hour\", which peaked at UK #38. A UK tour started in May 1983, featuring additional guitarist Robin George for live performances. Magnum also appeared at the 1983 Reading Festival, with George.\n\nMagnum and Jet parted company shortly afterwards, Kex Gorin was replaced by Jim Simpson and Stanway took some time away from the band to work with Phil Lynott, being replaced by Eddie George. Local businessman Keith Baker (Time Music) engaged the band, an independent tour was organised for February 1984 without the backing of a record label. Lawrence Archer temporarily stood in for Clarkin when he became ill.\n\nStanway returned to the band in 1984, and they toured the UK in January 1985. Magnum signed a one-off deal with FM Records, and released \"On a Storyteller's Night\", which had a cover by Rodney Matthews. It reached #24 in the UK, and launched the band across Europe. For the May UK tour, Simpson was replaced by Mickey Barker.\n\nFrom the success of \"On a Storyteller's Night\", Keith Baker was able to negotiate the band a major label deal with Polydor Records, and they embarked on the most commercially successful period of their career – opening the famous Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in August 1985, on a bill that also included Bon Jovi, Metallica, Marillion and headliners ZZ Top. A second leg for the \"Storyteller's\" tour was concluded in December 1985.\n\nThe first release for Polydor was in September 1986, entitled \"Vigilante\". The album was a move towards the mainstream due to production by Queen drummer Roger Taylor and David Richards, who had recently worked together on \"A Kind of Magic\". The switch to Polydor saw an increase in the marketing budget, and promotional videos were made for the singles \"Lonely Night\" and \"Midnight\". A full UK and European tour was scheduled in March 1986, including appearances at The Garden Party Festival, Milton Keynes Bowl in June and the Out In The Green Festival. A second leg was organised in September 1986, which finished in Europe in November 1986. In March 1987, the band embarked on a third UK and European tour, including an appearance at 1987's Reading Festival.\n\nMagnum enjoyed increased success with the album \"Wings of Heaven\" (#5 in the UK). Three singles from \"Wings of Heaven\" reached the UK Top 40, including a \"Top of the Pops\" appearance with \"Start Talking Love\". A successful tour followed in December and, by now, Magnum had been elevated to an 'arena' band in the UK, headlining the N.E.C. and several nights at London's Hammersmith Odeon, supported by the Norwegian band Stage Dolls.\n\nThe band went to Los Angeles for the Keith Olsen produced \"Goodnight L.A.\", which peaked at #9 in the UK chart. The band performed at Berlin's Arena Festival, followed by a full UK and European tour in September 1990. They toured the UK again in November. Following \"Goodnight L.A.'s\" lukewarm reception, Magnum parted company with Polydor. They released the live album \"The Spirit\" in 1991 and toured the UK and Europe again to support the album. During the concerts in Germany, the band played live with the Roger Taylor band The Cross. Magnum continued to release albums for various labels on one-off deals, the first being \"Sleepwalking\" in 1992 on Music for Nations with a full UK tour in October. This was followed by the acoustic album \"Keeping the Nite Light Burning\" in 1993 with a UK tour in April.\n\n\"Rock Art\" was released in 1994 on EMI. The album charted 57 in the United Kingdom, the lowest position for a studio album since 1979. A UK tour was scheduled for April, but dates in May and June were postponed or cancelled. A low key tour was arranged for August and Europe in September, followed by another tour in the spring 1995. Clarkin wrote eleven new songs for the planned next album, which were recorded and sent to record companies, their contract with EMI having expired. However, they received no offer from any major record company, and the band faced financial difficulties. Meanwhile, Clarkin had started to feel creatively trapped, as fans and critics did not appreciate the band's musical evolution. In September 1995, Clarkin decided to quit. The other band members were shocked by his decision, and made vain attempts to talk him out of it. They briefly considered continuing with a different guitarist, but soon concluded that Clarkin - being the band's sole songwriter - was irreplaceable. They managed to talk Clarkin into doing a farewell tour in the United Kingdom and Europe, documented on the live album \"Stronghold\" (titled \"The Last Dance\" in mainland Europe). After a final concert on December 17, 1995, the Magnum disbanded.\n\nAfter Magnum split, a spin-off group featuring Catley and Clarkin was formed called Hard Rain, which released the albums \"Hard Rain\" and \"When the Good Times Come\". It was around this time that Catley launched a solo career using various songwriters, including Gary Hughes of the band Ten. However, Hard Rain found bookings hard to come by, and there were discussions about renaming the band as Magnum. At the same time, Catley was becoming increasingly focused on his solo career, and in September 1999 he quit Hard Rain, marking the end of a working relationship with Clarkin that dated back to 1972. Clarkin briefly continued Hard Rain with Sue McCloskey replacing Catley on vocals. They performed with this lineup at a charity event in January 2000, but Hard Rain never released any additional new material. After a quiet period, Clarkin announced the end of the band. Talks about a Magnum reunion began in early 2001.\n\nDuring Magnum's split, one of Clarkin's friends found a live recording from 1976 in his loft. Clarkin, fed up with the many unofficial compilations that had been released without the band's authorisation, was initially reluctant to authorise the release of this old material. He eventually changed his mind, and \"Days of Wonder\" was released in April 2000.\n\nIn March 2001, Catley revealed that Clarkin had suggested a reunion, apparently after his manager Derek Kemp had convinced him that giving Magnum a new shot was worth it. Catley and Clarkin had hoped for a complete reunion of the pre-1995 lineup, but only Mark Stanway ended up returning to the band. Al Barrow, who had been a member of Hard Rain, replaced Wally Lowe as the band's bassist.\n\nClarkin's manager's assessment proved to be correct; while in 1995 the band had difficulties getting a record deal, this time they got several offers. They ultimately signed a deal with SPV Steamhammer in September 2001. In February 2002, \"Breath of Life\" was released, followed by a UK tour in December. They recorded the album without a drummer, before hiring Thunder drummer Harry James to complete the lineup. This was subsequently followed by \"Brand New Morning\" in 2004, and appearances at Germany's Bang Your Head Festival, the Lorca Rock Festival in Spain and a tour around the UK and Europe in December. Clarkin commented:\n\nWhen James returned to Thunder, Jimmy Copley became a full-time member of Magnum. The band toured in April 2005 to mark the 20th anniversary of \"On a Storyteller's Night\"; they released a live DVD of the Astoria concert entitled \"Livin' the Dream\", which also included a short documentary and promotional videos from throughout the band's history.\n\nMagnum completed work on a new studio album, \"Princess Alice and the Broken Arrow\", which was released on 26 March 2007; this also marked the return to the cover artwork by Rodney Matthews. The album entered the UK Album Charts at No. 70, the first time Magnum had charted in the UK since 1994. It also reached No. 4 on the BBC Rock Album Charts and No. 60 in Germany.\n\nMagnum toured the UK and Europe in May 2007. Harry James played drums temporarily for half the tour as Jimmy Copley was taken ill. Copley died in 2017.\n\nIn 2005, former drummer Kex Gorin was diagnosed with kidney cancer. Gorin had a kidney removed and underwent radiotherapy and steroid treatment, but died of the disease on 21 December 2007. In 2007, Magnum played a one off show at the Robin 2 in Bilston, Wolverhampton. This was a charity event in aid of former drummer Kex Gorin's family. An auction of memorabilia before the show raised over £10,000. Magnum then played a two-hour set of old and new material. Magnum undertook a UK tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of \"Wings of Heaven\" in November 2007. These shows were recorded for \"Wings of Heaven Live\" album, which was released in March 2008.\n\nIn September 2008, Bob Catley released the album \"Immortal\", his last solo album to date. Until that point, he had released a solo album between each Magnum album. With the end of this pattern, the typical time gap between each Magnum album was shortened from approximately two and a half years to less than two years. On 15 June 2009, they released \"Into the Valley of the Moonking\" on SPV. In 2010, the band released, \"The Gathering\", on Universal/Sanctuary; their first ever cross-career collection spread over five discs featuring a 1988 live recording from Hammersmith Odeon. The band released their next album, \"The Visitation\", in 2011. The band toured in support of the album, which charted at No. 55 in the UK and No. 19 in Germany, throughout March and April 2011.\n\nOn 30 August, Magnum announced a new compilation remix album \"Evolution\" celebrating the last 10 years on SPV GmbH since their reformation in 2001. The album was released on 11 November 2011 in Germany and 14 November in the rest of Europe and the UK. The album featured 10 songs from the band's previous five studio releases, eight were re-recorded, remixed and remastered, as well as two new songs.\n\nThe band released their 17th studio album \"On the 13th Day\" in September 2012. \"So Let It Rain\" was the first single, released in August 2012 via Steamhammer/SPV. The band toured in Europe to promote the album in late 2012 which charted in many countries across Europe including the UK at No. 43. Soon after releasing and touring \"On the 13th Day\" Magnum revealed that Clarkin was back in the studio writing and recording new songs via Facebook on 4 April 2013. The new album, called \"Escape from the Shadow Garden\", also was to feature Rodney Matthews's artwork, this time showing similarities to Magnum's early albums \"Chase the Dragon\" (the tree) and \"On a Storyteller's Night\" (the storyteller), along with elements from more recent albums such as \"On the 13th Day\". \"Escape From the Shadow Garden\" was released in Scandinavia on 19 March 2014, and on 21 March for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, 24 March for the rest of Europe, and 1 April for the USA and Canada. As with \"On the 13th Day\" the band were hosts to their fans at a record launch party held at the Robin 2 in Bilston on 25 March 2014, the day after the UK release. Compared with Magnum's album releases since reformation it was a great commercial success reaching number 14 in the German Albums Chart, 19 in the Swedish Albums Chart, 22 in the Switzerland Albums Chart and 38 in the official UK Albums Chart, a position last achieved by Magnum with \"The Eleventh Hour!\" in 1983. It also reached number two in the UK Rock Albums Chart. The album was followed by a European tour, during which the live album \"Escape from the Shadow Garden – Live 2014\" was recorded. It was released in May 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Magum released the album \"Sacred Blood \"Divine\" Lies\", 10 brand new tracks forging forward the Magnum sound. With the collaboration once again with Rodney Matthews artwork the release came with bonus videos and bonus tracks. The album was followed by a 33 date 2016 tour in EU, UK and Ireland and then again a winter tour appearing at a few UK and Irish venues. After a conversation between Clarkin and his daughter discussing all the ballads the band had in the catalogue, he talked to SPV and they agreed. This turned out to be a longer process than anticipated. Many songs undertook a lot of treatment to remix, re-master and even re-record complete songs. The new ballads album titled \"The Valley of Tears – The Ballads\" was released on 6 January 2017.\n\nIn December 2016, Mark Stanway left the band. He was replaced by West Midlands session musician Rick Benton, who made his first live appearance in Wolverhampton 2016. He was officially announced as the new member in January 2017. A few months later, due to conflicting schedules, Lee Morris replaced Harry James as the band's drummer. With this new lineup, the band started recording their next album in February 2017. \"Lost on the Road to Eternity\" was released in January 2018, and the band embarked on a tour, which resulted in the live album \"Live at the Symphony Hall\" in January 2019.\n\nOn 25 June 2019, bassist Al Barrow announced his departure from the band due to his difficulties in spending much time away from his home in America. Dennis Ward (Pink Cream 69, Unisonic) was announced as the new member.\n\nClarkin continued to write new material. On 17 January 2020, \"The Serpent Rings\", the band's 21st studio album, was released. A tour had been scheduled for the spring, but it had to be postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2161966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161966", "title": "Dorothy Kingsley", "text": "Dorothy Kingsley\n\nDorothy Kingsley (October 14, 1909 – September 26, 1997) was an American screenwriter, who worked extensively in film, radio and television.\n\nBorn in New York City, Kingsley was the daughter of newspaperman and press agent Walter J. Kingsley, and silent film actress Alma Hanlon. Following their divorce, Hanlon remarried to director Louis Myll. They lived at Bayside, Queens for two years, and later moved with Dorothy to the affluent suburb of Grosse Pointe, Michigan.\n\nKingsley also had an unsuccessful first marriage. As a young divorced mother of three, while recuperating from a severe case of the measles, she listened to all the radio programs and began to think that she could write better material than she was hearing. She went to Los Angeles to visit a friend and made the rounds of numerous agents with material she had written for various radio stars such as Jack Benny. Her youthful appearance worked against her, but she finally found an agent who would take a chance on her. Kingsley went home and packed up her children, but on her return to Los Angeles she found that the agent had gone out of business.\n\nWhile Kingsley unsuccessfully made the rounds of agents, she happened to meet Constance Bennett socially. Bennett thought that Kingsley's material was better than her current supply, and used a couple of her gags on her radio program. Despite the size of the program's writing staff, Kingsley began supplying material gags under the table for $75 a week, but eventually the representative who was paying her for the material left and she was again unemployed. Kingsley answered a newspaper ad to write gags for Edgar Bergen, and as a result she was chosen from 400 entries for a one-month trial period at $50 a week. The Edgar Bergen show became one of the top-rated programs and Kingsley stayed with them for several years.\n\nIt was while she was with the Bergen radio show that Kingsley started submitting scripts to studios. Arthur Freed at MGM thought she had promise and wanted to put her under contract at double what Bergen was paying. Bergen was notorious for underpaying his talent and when he found out she was dismissed. Her first assignment was a production rewrite on \"Girl Crazy\", a Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musical. The current writer was otherwise occupied, so Freed asked her to go down to the set and just do a little work. Kingsley soon developed the ability to fix an ailing script during production, and while she was working on \"Girl Crazy\", producer Jack Cummings was having a lot of trouble with \"Bathing Beauty\" and asked her to fix that as well. Many people had already worked on the ailing script whose musical numbers had been shot and had no story. It was the first picture for \"Esther Williams\" and became a big hit.\n\nKingsley often worked without credit; and though hers was usually a co-credit, she normally worked alone, before or after the other screenwriters had finished up. Kingsley wrote many of the great MGM musicals such as \"Kiss Me Kate\", as well as a number of scripts for Debbie Reynolds and three quarters of all the Esther Williams pictures. The grand spectacle pictures were very popular during the war years, when people desperately wanted escapist entertainment. In 1948, Kingsley and fellow screenwriter Dorothy Cooper wrote \"A Date with Judy\", which was a pivotal film for Elizabeth Taylor, who, after playing frail juvenile roles, was given the part of a manipulative modern flirt who saw a school campus as merely husband-hunting grounds.\n\nKingsley, a devout Catholic, wrote the baseball picture \"Angels in the Outfield\", President Eisenhower's favorite picture, which featured the Pittsburgh Pirates. He ran it so many times that the staff said, “Please, Mr. President, not again.\"\n\nShe was the last of the writers to work on the script for Stanley Donen's \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" after Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. Their original script was based on the short story \"The Sobbin' Women\" by Stephen Vincent Benet, but the script wasn't coming out right. From Kingsley: \"Stanley Donen called me in and I looked at the script and said, 'The big trouble in the original short story is that the Howard Keel character is the one that tries to get all of these boys married off, and that’s not right. The girl has nothing to do, and she’s got to be the one to engineer all this stuff.' That was changed around and seemed to please everyone, and we went from there.\"\n\nAfter she had been at MGM a while, Kingsley acquired the reputation as a fixer in construction. She would regularly be called down to the set to fix pictures on the fly when the original writers were no longer on the scene to be consulted. The studio kept her working all the time and her contract was continually being extended.\n\nColumbia was set to produce \"Pal Joey\", which was a perfect vehicle for Frank Sinatra; however, Sinatra and Columbia executive Harry Cohn had been feuding for years and didn't speak to each other. Kingsley and Lillian Burns, the assistant to Harry Cohn, did a synopsis of the film written with Sinatra in mind and had it sent to Sinatra without Cohn's involvement. Sinatra agreed to do the picture and Cohn committed without ever seeing the script. Sinatra was so pleased with what Kingsley had done with \"Pal Joey\", he committed to \"Can-Can\" without a script.\n\nIn 1969, she was instrumental in creating the \"Bracken's World\" series for television, based on the behind-the-scenes activities at the fictitious Century Studios in Hollywood.\n\nKingsley and her second husband, William Durney, left Hollywood for Carmel, California, where they started the Durney Vineyard brand winery. They were among the earliest vintners in the Carmel Valley Wine region when they planted their original vineyards in 1968, with the first wines being produced in 1976.\n\nDorothy Kingsley died of heart failure in 1997 in Monterey, California. She is buried in San Carlos Cemetery in Monterey, California\n\n\n"}

She came out as a lesbian at age 15 and is well known for her support of both LGBT and feminist causes. Samson graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 2000, with a degree in film.\n\nIn 2010, Samson served as a judge at the 9th annual Independent Music Awards.\n\nSamson joined Le Tigre in 2000 when co-founder Sadie Benning left the band before the album \"Feminist Sweepstakes\" was recorded. Samson had previously worked as the band's projectionist and slide show operator during live performances in support of their first record, \"Le Tigre\". The self-proclaimed \"underground electro-feminist performance artists\" combined visuals, music and dance in their performances. Samson's contributions to Le Tigre include the song \"Viz\", which deals with her experiences as a member of a sexual minority, and \"New Kicks,\" which contains excerpts of a protest that Samson recorded.\n\n\"Feminist Sweepstakes\" came out in 2001 and was released on Mr. Lady Records & Videos in North America and on Chicks On Speed Records in Europe. Le Tigre's final album, \"This Island\" (2004), was Le Tigre's first on a major label (Universal Records). Ric Ocasek of the Cars produced one track, \"Tell You Now\". Samson and her Le Tigre bandmates Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman also produced the Christina Aguilera song \"My Girls ft. Peaches\", for Aguilera's album \"Bionic\". In the second half of 2006 the band decided to take an extended break.\n\nIn 2016, Le Tigre reunited to show support for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, releasing their first song in a decade entitled \"I'm With Her\".\n\nIn 2007 Samson and Fateman formed a new project, MEN, as a DJ, production, and remix team. After initial songwriting and outside remix work, Fateman took time off to have a child, and Samson recruited the members of their side band Hirsute, including Ladybug Transistor's Michael O'Neill and Ginger Brooks Takahashi, to perform live as MEN. Samson has said that their music speaks of \"issues such as wartime economies, sexual compromise, and the demand for liberties through lyrical content and an inventive, high-energy stage show\".\n\nIn 2009 MEN self-released an EP called MEN that sold out following US tours with Peaches and Gossip. MEN also toured in the UK and Europe during this time. Their debut album \"Talk About Body\" was released on February 1, 2011 via Iamsound in the US and through Sony/Columbia in Europe.

{"id": "2162003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162003", "title": "Vowel breaking", "text": "Vowel breaking\n\nIn historical linguistics, vowel breaking, vowel fracture, or diphthongization is the sound change of a monophthong into a diphthong or triphthong.\n\nVowel breaking may be unconditioned or conditioned. It may be triggered by the presence of another sound, by stress, or in no particular way.\n\nVowel breaking is sometimes defined as a subtype of diphthongization, when it refers to harmonic (assimilatory) process that involves diphthongization triggered by a following vowel or consonant.\n\nThe original pure vowel typically breaks into two segments. The first segment matches the original vowel, and the second segment is harmonic with the nature of the triggering vowel or consonant. For example, the second segment may be /u/ (a back vowel) if the following vowel or consonant is back (such as velar or pharyngeal), and the second segment may be /i/ (a front vowel) if the following vowel or consonant is front (such as palatal).\n\nThus, vowel breaking, in the restricted sense, can be viewed as an example of assimilation of a vowel to a following vowel or consonant.\n\nVowel breaking is sometimes not assimilatory and is then not triggered by a neighboring sound. That was the case with the Great Vowel Shift in English in which all cases of and changed to diphthongs.\n\nVowel breaking sometimes occurs only in stressed syllables. For instance, Vulgar Latin open-mid and changed to diphthongs only when they were stressed.\n\nVowel breaking is a very common sound change in the history of the English language, occurring at least three times (with some varieties adding a fourth) listed here in reverse chronological order:\n\nVowel breaking is characteristic of the \"Southern drawl\" of Southern American English, where the short front vowels have developed a glide up to [j], and then in some areas back down to schwa: \"pat\" , \"pet\" , \"pit\" .\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift changed the long vowels to diphthongs, which became Modern English .\n\nIn early Middle English, a vowel was inserted between a front vowel and a following (pronounced in this context), and a vowel was inserted between a back vowel and a following (pronounced in this context).\n\nThat is a prototypical example of the narrow sense of \"vowel breaking\" as described above: the original vowel breaks into a diphthong that assimilates to the following consonant, gaining a front before a palatal consonant and before a velar consonant.\n\nIn Old English, two forms of harmonic vowel breaking occurred: breaking and retraction and back mutation.\n\nIn prehistoric Old English, breaking and retraction changed stressed short and long front vowels \"i, e, æ\" to short and long diphthongs spelled \"io, eo, ea\" when followed by \"h\" or by \"r, l\" + another consonant (short vowels only), and sometimes \"w\" (only for certain short vowels):\n\nIn late prehistoric Old English, back mutation changed short front \"i, e, æ\" to short diphthongs spelled \"io, eo, ea\" before a back vowel in the next syllable if the intervening consonant was of a certain nature. The specific nature of the consonants that trigger back umlaut or block it varied from dialect to dialect.\n\nProto-Germanic stressed short \"e\" becomes \"ja\" or (before \"u\") \"jǫ\" regularly in Old Norse except after \"w, r, l\". Examples are:\n\nAccording to some scholars, the diphthongisation of \"e\" is an unconditioned sound change, whereas other scholars speak about epenthesis or umlaut.\n\nThe long high vowels of Middle High German underwent breaking during the transition to Early New High German: → . In Yiddish, the diphthongization affected the long mid vowels as well: → \n\nThis change started as early as the 12th century in Upper Bavarian and reached Moselle Franconian only in the 16th century. It did not affect Alemannic or Ripuarian dialects, which still retain the original long vowels.\n\nIn Yiddish, the diphthongization applied not only to MHG long vowels but also to in words of Hebrew (in stressed open syllables) or Slavic origin:\n\nVowel breaking is present in Scottish Gaelic with the following changes occurring often but variably between dialects: Archaic Irish \"eː\" → Scottish Gaelic \"iə\" and Archaic Irish \"oː\" → Scottish Gaelic \"uə\" Specifically, central dialects have more vowel breaking than others.\n\nMany Romance languages underwent vowel breaking. The Vulgar Latin open vowels \"e\" and \"o\" in stressed position underwent breaking only in open syllables in French and Italian, but in both open and closed syllables in Spanish. Vowel breaking was mostly absent in Catalan, in which and only became diphthongs when followed by a palatal consonant, as seen in Latin coxa 'thigh', octō 'eight', lectum 'bed' > Old Catalan */kuoiʃa/, */uoit/, */lieit/. The middle vowel was subsequently lost if a triphthong is produced, as seen in Modern Catalan cuixa, vuit, llit (cf. Portuguese coxa, oito, leito). Vowel breaking was completely absent in Portuguese. The result of breaking varies between languages: \"e\" and \"o\" became \"ie\" and \"ue\" in Spanish, \"ie\" and \"uo\" in Italian, and \"ie\" and \"eu\" in French.\n\nIn the table below, words with breaking are bolded.\n\nRomanian underwent the general Romance breaking only with , as it did not have :\n\nIt underwent a later breaking of stressed \"e\" and \"o\" to \"ea\" and \"oa\" before a mid or open vowel:\n\nSometimes a word underwent both forms of breaking in succession:\n\nThe diphthongs that resulted from the Romance and the Romanian breakings were modified when they occurred after palatalized consonants.\n\nIn Quebec French, long vowels are generally diphthongized in the last syllable.\n\n\nSome scholars believe that Proto-Indo-European (PIE) \"i, u\" had vowel-breaking before an original laryngeal in Greek, Armenian and Tocharian but that the other Indo-European languages kept the monophthongs:\n\n\nHowever, the hypothesis has not been widely adopted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2162018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162018", "title": "Ottonian art", "text": "Ottonian art\n\nOttonian art is a style in pre-romanesque German art, covering also some works from the Low Countries, northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian Hubert Janitschek after the Ottonian dynasty which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings Henry I, Otto I, Otto II, Otto III and Henry II. With Ottonian architecture, it is a key component of the Ottonian Renaissance (circa 951–1024). However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty. It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early Salian dynasty, which lacks an artistic \"style label\" of its own. In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows Carolingian art and precedes Romanesque art, though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden. Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important monasteries, as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading vassals.\n\nAfter the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon Ottonian dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin. Surviving Ottonian art is very largely religious, in the form of illuminated manuscripts and metalwork, and was produced in a small number of centres for a narrow range of patrons in the circle of the Imperial court, as well as important figures in the church. However much of it was designed for display to a wider public, especially of pilgrims.\n\nThe style is generally grand and heavy, sometimes to excess, and initially less sophisticated than the Carolingian equivalents, with less direct influence from Byzantine art and less understanding of its classical models, but around 1000 a striking intensity and expressiveness emerge in many works, as \"a solemn monumentality is combined with a vibrant inwardness, an unworldly, visionary quality with sharp attention to actuality, surface patterns of flowing lines and rich bright colours with passionate emotionalism\".\n\nFollowing late Carolingian styles, \"presentation portraits\" of the patrons of manuscripts are very prominent in Ottonian art, and much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as Constantine, Theoderic, and Justinian as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly Charlemagne. This goal was accomplished in various ways. For example, the many Ottonian ruler portraits typically include elements, such as province personifications, or representatives of the military and the Church flanking the emperor, with a lengthy imperial iconographical history. As well as the reuse of motifs from older imperial art, the removal of spolia from Late Antique structures in Rome and Ravenna and their incorporation into Ottonian buildings was a device intended to suggest imperial continuity. This was clearly the intention of Otto I when he removed columns, some of porphyry, and other building materials from the Palace of Theoderic in Ravenna and reused them in his new cathedral at Magdeburg. The one thing the ruler portraits rarely attempt is a close likeness of the individual features of a ruler; when Otto III died, some manuscript images of him were re-purposed as portraits of Henry II without the need being felt to change the features.\n\nIn a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain presentation miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor. In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St Pirmin, founder of Hornbach Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the \"command structure\" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.\n\nByzantine art also remained an influence, especially with the marriage of the Greek princess Theophanu to Otto II, and imported Byzantine elements, especially enamels and ivories, are often incorporated into Ottonian metalwork such as book covers. However, if there were actual Greek artists working in Germany in the period, they have left less trace than their predessors in Carolingian times. The manuscripts were both scribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills, some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen, though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the Early Medieval period, and some lay brothers and lay assistants employed by monasteries. While secular jewellery supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, ivory carving at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries, although (see below) wall-paintings seems to have been usually done by laymen.\n\nOttonian monasteries produced many magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available. The range of heavily illuminated texts was very largely restricted (unlike in the Carolingian Renaissance) to the main liturgical books, with very few secular works being so treated.\n\nIn contrast to manuscripts of other periods, it is very often possible to say with certainty who commissioned or received a manuscript, but not where it was made. Some manuscripts also include relatively extensive cycles of narrative art, such as the sixteen pages of the Codex Aureus of Echternach devoted to \"strips\" in three tiers with scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" and his parables. Heavily illuminated manuscripts were given rich treasure bindings and their pages were probably seen by very few; when they were carried in the grand processions of Ottonian churches it seems to have been with the book closed to display the cover.\n\nThe Ottonian style did not produce surviving manuscripts from before about the 960s, when books known as the \"Eburnant group\" were made, perhaps at Lorsch, as several miniatures in the Gero Codex (now Darmstadt), the earliest and grandest of the group, copy those in the Carolingian Lorsch Gospels. This is the first stylistic group of the traditional \"Reichenau school\". The two other major manuscripts of the group are the sacramentaries named for Hornbach and Petershausen. In the group of four presentation miniatures in the former described above \"we can almost follow ... the movement away from the expansive Carolingian idiom to the more sharply defined Ottonian one\".\nA number of important manuscripts produced from this period onwards in a distinctive group of styles are usually attributed to the scriptorium of the island monastery of Reichenau in Lake Constance, despite an admitted lack of evidence connecting them to the monastery there. C. R. Dodwell was one of a number of dissident voices here, believing the works to have been produced at Lorsch and Trier instead. Wherever it was located, the \"Reichenau school\" specialized in gospel books and other liturgical books, many of them, such as the Munich Gospels of Otto III (c. 1000) and the Pericopes of Henry II (Munich, Bayerische Nationalbibl. clm. 4452, c. 1001–1024), imperial commissions. Due to their exceptional quality, the manuscripts of Reichenau were in 2003 added to the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register.\n\nThe most important \"Reichenau school\" manuscripts are agreed to fall into three distinct groups, all named after scribes whose names are recorded in their books. The \"Eburnant group\" covered above was followed by the \"Ruodprecht group\" named after the scribe of the Egbert Psalter; Dodwell assigns this group to Trier. The Aachen Gospels of Otto III, also known as the Liuthar Gospels, give their name to the third \"Liuthar group\" of manuscripts, most from the 11th century, in a strongly contrasting style, though still attributed by most scholars to Reichenau, but by Dodwell also to Trier.\n\nThe outstanding miniaturist of the \"Ruodprecht group\" was the so-called Master of the \"Registrum Gregorii\", or Gregory Master, whose work looked back in some respects to Late Antique manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for \"their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise\". He worked chiefly in Trier in the 970s and 980s, and was responsible for several miniatures in the influential \"Codex Egberti\", a gospel lectionary made for Archbishop Egbert of Trier, probably in the 980s. However, the majority of the 51 images in this book, which represent the first extensive cycle of images depicting the events of Christ's life in a western European manuscript, were made by two monks from Reichenau, who are named and depicted in one of the miniatures.\n\nThe style of the \"Liuthar group\" is very different, and departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it \"carried transcendentalism to an extreme\", with \"marked schematization of the forms and colours\", \"flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture\". Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them \"emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance\", with narrative scenes \"presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity\". This gestural \"dumb-show [was] soon to be conventionalized as a visual language throughout medieval Europe\".\n\nThe group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich Gospels of Otto III, the Bamberg Apocalypse and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the Pericopes of Henry II, the best known and most extreme of the group, where \"the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void\". The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.\n\nTwo dedication miniatures added to the Egmond Gospels around 975 show a less accomplished Netherlandish version of Ottonian style. In Regensburg St. Emmeram's Abbey held the major Carolingian Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which probably influenced a style with \"an incisive line and highly formal organization of the page\", giving in the Uta Codex of c. 1020 complex schemes where \"bands of gold outline the bold, squares circles, ellipses, and rhombs that enclose the figures\", and inscriptions are incorporated in the design explicating its complex theological symbolism. This style was to be very influential on Romanesque art in several media.\n\nEchternach Abbey became important under Abbot Humbert, in office from 1028 to 1051, and the pages (as opposed to the cover) of the Codex Aureus of Echternach were produced there, followed by the Golden Gospels of Henry III in 1045–46, which Henry presented to Speyer Cathedral (now Escorial), the major work of the school. Henry also commissioned the Uppsala Gospels for the cathedral there (now in the university library). Other important monastic scriptoria that flourished during the Ottonian age include those at Salzburg, Hildesheim, Corvey, Fulda, and Cologne, where the Hitda Codex was made.\n\nThis scene was often included in Ottonian cycles of the Life of Christ. Many show Jesus (with crossed halo) twice, once asleep and once calming the storm.\n\nObjects for decorating churches such as crosses, reliquaries, altar frontals and treasure bindings for books were all made of or covered by gold, embellished with gems, enamels, crystals, and cameos. This was a much older style, but the Ottonian version has distinctive features, with very busy decoration of surfaces, often gems raised up from the main surface on little gold towers, accompanied by \"beehive\" projections in gold wire, and figurative reliefs in repoussé gold decorating areas between the bars of enamel and gem decoration. Relics were assuming increasing importance, sometimes political, in this period, and so increasingly rich reliquaries were made to hold them. In such works the gems do not merely create an impression of richness, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the Celestial city, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various \"scientific\", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular lapidary books. The few surviving pieces of secular jewellery are in similar styles, including the crown worn by Otto III as a child, which he presented to the Golden Madonna of Essen after he outgrew it.\n\nExamples of \"crux gemmata\" or processional crosses include an outstanding group in the Essen Cathedral Treasury; several abbesses of Essen Abbey were Ottonian princesses. The Cross of Otto and Mathilde, Cross of Mathilde and the Essen cross with large enamels were probably all given by Mathilde, Abbess of Essen (died 1011), and a fourth cross, the Theophanu Cross came some fifty years later. The Cross of Lothair (Aachen) and Imperial Cross (Vienna) were imperial possessions; Vienna also has the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. The book cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) is in a very comparable style. Other major objects include a reliquary of St Andrew surmounted by a foot in Trier, and gold altar frontals for the Palace Chapel, Aachen and Basel Cathedral (now in Paris). The Palace Chapel also has the pulpit or Ambon of Henry II. The late Carolingian upper cover of the Lindau Gospels (Morgan Library, New York) and the Arnulf Ciborium in Munich were important forerunners of the style, from a few decades before and probably from the same workshop.\n\nLarge objects in non-precious metals were also made, with the earliest surviving wheel chandeliers from the end of the period, a huge candelabra in Essen, and in particular a spectacular collection of ambitious large bronze works, and smaller silver ones, at Hildesheim Cathedral from the period of Bishop Bernward (died 1022), who was himself an artist, although his biographer was unusually honest in saying that he did not reach \"the peaks of perfection\". The most famous of these is the pair of church doors, the Bernward Doors, with biblical figure scenes in bronze relief, each cast in a single piece, where the powerfully simple compositions convey their meanings by emphatic gestures, in a way comparable to the Reichenau miniatures of the same period. There is also a bronze column, the Bernward Column, over twelve feet high, originally the base for a crucifix, cast in a single hollow piece. This unusual form is decorated with twenty-four scenes from the ministry of Jesus in a continuous strip winding round the column in the manner of Trajan's Column and other Roman examples.\n\nAround 980, Archbishop Egbert of Trier seems to have established the major Ottonian workshop producing cloisonné enamel in Germany, which is thought to have fulfilled orders for other centres, and after his death in 993 possibly moved to Essen. During this period the workshop followed Byzantine developments (of many decades earlier) by using the \"senkschmelz\" or \"sunk enamel\" technique in addition to the \"vollschmelz\" one already used. Small plaques with decorative motifs derived from plant forms continued to use \"vollschmelz\", with enamel all over the plaque, while figures were now usually in \"senkschmelz\", surrounded by a plain gold surface into which the outline of the figure had been recessed. The Essen cross with large enamels illustrated above shows both these techniques.\n\nMuch very fine small-scale sculpture in ivory was made during the Ottonian period, with Milan probably a site if not the main centre, along with Trier and other German and French sites. There are many oblong panels with reliefs which once decorated book-covers, or still do, with the \"Crucifixion of Jesus\" as the most common subject. These and other subjects very largely continue Carolingian iconography, but in a very different style.\n\nA group of four Ottonian ivory situlae appear to represent a new departure for ivory carving in their form, and the type is hardly found after this period. Situlae were liturgical vessels used to hold holy water, and previously were usually of wood or bronze, straight-sided and with a handle. An aspergillum was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects. However the four Ottonian examples from the 10th century are made from a whole section of elephant tusk, and are slightly larger in girth at their tops. All are richly carved with scenes and figures on different levels: the Basilewsky Situla of 920 in the Victoria & Albert Museum, decorated with scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" on two levels, the \"Situla of Gotofredo\" of c. 980 in Milan Cathedral, one in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, and one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop Gotfredus presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor, also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop. The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops. This was probably made in Trier about 1000.\n\nAmong various stylistic groups and putative workshops that can be detected, that responsible for pieces including the panel from the cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach and two diptych wings now in Belin (all illustrated below) produced particularly fine and distinctive work, perhaps in Trier, with \"an astonishing perception of the human form ... [and] facility in handling the material\".\n\nA very important group of plaques, now dispersed in several collections, were probably commissioned (perhaps by Otto I) for Magdeburg Cathedral and are called the Magdeburg Ivories, \"Magdeburg plaques\", the \"plaques from the Magdeburg Antependium\" or similar names. They were probably made in Milan in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an antependium or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed. Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the \"Life of Christ\" inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York has a \"dedication\" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral. Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set. The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold. Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns. The style of the figures is described by Peter Lasko as \"very heavy, stiff, and massive ... with extremely clear and flat treatment of drapery ... in simple but powerful compositions\".\n\nAlthough it is clear from documentary records that many churches were decorated with extensive cycles of wall-painting, survivals are extremely rare, and more often than not fragmentary and in poor condition. Generally they lack evidence to help with dating such as donor portraits, and their date is often uncertain; many have been restored in the past, further complicating the matter. Most survivals are clustered in south Germany and around Fulda in Hesse; though there are also important examples from north Italy. There is a record of bishop Gebhard of Constance hiring lay artists for a now vanished cycle at his newly foundation (983) of Petershausen Abbey, and laymen may have dominated the art of wall-painting, though perhaps sometimes working to designs by monastic illuminators. The artists seem to have been rather mobile: \"at about the time of the Oberzell pictures there was an Italian wall-painter working in Germany, and a German one in England\".\n\nThe church of St George at Oberzell on Reichenau Island has the best-known surviving scheme, though much of the original work has been lost and the remaining paintings to the sides of the nave have suffered from time and restoration. The largest scenes show the miracles of Christ in a style that both shows specific Byzantine input in some elements, and a closeness to Reichenau manuscripts such as the Munich Gospels of Otto III; they are therefore usually dated around 980–1000. Indeed, the paintings are one of the foundations of the case for Reichenau Abbey as a major centre of manuscript painting.\n\nVery little wood carving has survived from the period, but the monumental painted figure of Christ on the Gero Cross (around 965–970, Cologne Cathedral) is one of the outstanding masterpieces of the period. Its traditional dating by the church, long thought to be implausibly early, was finally confirmed by dendrochronology. The Golden Madonna of Essen (about 1000, Essen Cathedral, which was formerly the abbey) is a virtually unique survival of a type of object once found in many major churches. It is a smaller sculpture of the Virgin and Child, which is in wood which was covered with gesso and then thin gold sheet. Monumental sculpture remained rare in the north, though there are more examples in Italy, such as the stucco reliefs on the ciborium of Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and also on that in San Pietro al Monte, Civate, which relate to ivory carving of the same period, and some stone sculpture.\n\nSurviving Ottonian works are very largely those in the care of the church which were kept and valued for their connections with either royal or church figures of the period. Very often the jewels in metalwork were pilfered or sold over the centuries, and many pieces now completely lack them, or have modern glass paste replacements. As from other periods, there are many more surviving ivory panels (whose material is usually hard to re-use) for book-covers than complete metalwork covers, and some thicker ivory panels were later re-carved from the back with a new relief. Many objects mentioned in written sources have completely disappeared, and we probably now only have a tiny fraction of the original production of reliquaries and the like. A number of pieces have major additions or changes made later in the Middle Ages or in later periods. Manuscripts that avoided major library fires have had the best chance of survival; the dangers facing wall-paintings are mentioned above. Most major objects remain in German collections, often still church libraries and treasuries.\n\nThe term \"Ottonian art\" was not coined until 1890, and the following decade saw the first serious studies of the period; for the next several decades the subject was dominated by German art historians mainly dealing with manuscripts, apart from Adolph Goldschmidt's studies of ivories and sculpture in general. A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations. The 1950 Munich exhibition \"Ars Sacra\" (\"sacred art\" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by Peter Lasko in his book for the \"Pelican History of Art\", the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the \"minor arts\", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms. In 2003 a reviewer noted that Ottonian manuscript illustration was a field \"that is still significantly under-represented in English-language art-historical research\".\n\n\n\n"}

In 1664, when the authorities took steps to protect the weekly from its imitators, it became known as \"De Oprechte Haerlemse Courant\" (spellings vary; \"oprecht\" is here used in its archaic sense of \"genuine\"). After her husband's death in 1681, Margaretha received permission to carry on the activities of the firm.\n\nThe weekly (which soon began appearing twice and subsequently three times a week, and in the nineteenth century became a monthly) thus preceded English regular newspapers. In the paper's early days, the \"Windsor\" coffee house used to advertise that, apart from offering \"the best chocolate\", it supplied translations of \"the \"Harlem Courant\" soon after the post is come in\".\n\nDuring the German occupation of the Netherlands in the Second World War, the \"Opregte Haarlemsche Courant\" was forced to merge with \"Haarlems Dagblad\"; hence the latter paper's claim to being the oldest title extant.

It is not graphically-related to other braille scripts found around the world. Instead, it reflects the patterns found in hangul, and differentiates initial consonants, vowels, and final consonants.\n\nIt features characters for grammatical devices and punctuation. Numerals are similar to those of other braille systems.\n\nConsonants have different syllable-initial and -final variants, capturing some of the feel of hangul. The initial and final variants have the same shapes, but are shifted across the braille block. There are two patterns: The consonants that span the width of the block are shifted one space downward when final. Those that don't span the width of the block are on the right side of the block when initial, but on the left side when final.\n\nNo consonant occupies more than two rows.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>There is no initial version of \"ng\". Initial \"ieung\" in hangul is not written in Korean Braille. However, the expected form is reserved and may not serve other uses, such as punctuation.\n\nThe heavy (double) consonants are written by prefixing an \"s\", an old hangul convention. In initial position, they are:\n\nAll vowels span the width and height of the block. Because the consonants are specifically syllable-initial or syllable-final, a syllable that begins with a vowel causes no confusion when written without \"ieung\".\n\nThe simpler vowels reflect the symmetries of hangul: the \"yin–yang\" pairs \"a, eo\" and \"o, u\" are related through inversion, and yotization of \"a, eo, o, u\" is indicated by reflecting the vowel. This creates a different pattern of symmetry than in hangul. The graphically-similar hangul letters \"i\" and \"eu\" are also related by reflection. The \"w\" in \"wa, wo\" is indicated by making the left side of the block solid, while the \"i\" in \"ui, oe\" is shown by making the right side solid. However, the diphthongs \"e, ae\" and their yotized variants show no such patterns.\n\nFour diphthongs are represented with two braille blocks, by adding to the appropriate vowel for the final element \"-i\".\n\nKorean Braille contains several single cell syllable defined. Many are the braille cell for an initial consonant, with an assumed vowel \"a\" added. Some make use of unused cell definitions, while others utilize multi-cell abbreviations, often using malformed consonant clusters or consonant/vowel combinations otherwise abbreviated.\n\nAs in most braille scripts, is prefixed to digits, which are the same as in English Braille. is prefixed to the 26 basic roman letters in the same way.\n\nThe first tactile encoding of hangul was developed by Rosetta Sherwood Hall in 1894. It used a cell 4 dots wide by 2 dots high, like New York Point. 6-dot braille was adapted to Korean by Park Du-seong in 1926. There have since been a number of revisions. The current form was announced in 1994.\n\n"}

The Amu Darya river passes west of the town.\n\nThe city is best known for its world-class Nukus Museum of Art.\n\nThe name Nukus comes from the old tribal name of the Karakalpaks, Nukus. Nukus developed from a small settlement in 1932 into a large, modern Soviet city with broad avenues and big public buildings by the 1950s.\n\nThe city's isolation made it host to the Red Army's Chemical Research Institute, a major research and testing center for chemical weapons. In 2002 the United States Department of Defense dismantled the Chemical Research Institute, the major research and testing site for the Novichok agent, under a $6 million Cooperative Threat Reduction program.\n\nNukus is host to the Nukus Museum of Art (also known as the State Art Museum of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, named after Igor V. Savitsky) and State Museum. The State Museum houses the usual collection of artifacts recovered from archaeological investigations, traditional jewelry, costumes and musical instruments, displays of the area's now vanished or endangered flora and fauna, and on the Aral Sea issue. The Art Museum is noted for its collection of modern Russian and Uzbek art from 1918–1935. Stalin tried his best to eliminate all non Soviet art from this period, and sent most of the artists to the gulag. Both Savitsky himself and the collection at Nukus survived because the city's remoteness limited the influence and reach of Soviet authorities.
