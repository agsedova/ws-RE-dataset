Written in Old Egyptian, the pyramid texts were carved onto the subterranean walls and sarcophagi of pyramids at Saqqara from the end of the Fifth Dynasty, and throughout the Sixth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, and into the Eighth Dynasty of the First Intermediate Period.\n\nThe oldest of the texts have been dated to c. 2400–2300 BC. Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead, the pyramid texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated. Following the earlier Palermo Stone, the pyramid texts mark the next-oldest known mention of Osiris, who would become the most important deity associated with afterlife in the Ancient Egyptian religion.\n\nThe use and occurrence of pyramid texts changed between the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt. During the Old Kingdom (2686 BCE – 2181 BCE), pyramid texts could be found in the pyramids of kings as well as three queens named Wedjebten, Neith, and Iput. During the Middle Kingdom (2055 BCE – 1650 BCE), pyramid texts were not written in the pyramids of the pharaohs, but the traditions of the pyramid spells continued to be practiced. In the New Kingdom (1550 BCE – 1070 BCE), pyramid texts could now be found on tombs of officials.\n\nFrench archaeologist and Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, director of the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology in Cairo, arrived in Egypt in 1880. He chose a site in South Saqqara, a hill that had been mapped by the Prussian Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius in the prior decades, for his first archaeological dig. There, Maspero found the ruins of a large structure, which he concluded must be the pyramid of Pepi I of the Sixth Dynasty. During the excavations he was able to gain access to the subterranean rooms, and discovered that the walls of the structure were covered in hieroglyphic text. Maspero contacted the then 'director of the excavations' in Egypt, Auguste Mariette, to inform him of the discovery, though Mariette concluded that the structure must be a mastaba as no writing had previously been discovered in a pyramid.\nMaspero continued his excavations at a second structure, around one kilometre south-west of the first, in search of more evidence. This second structure was determined to be the pyramid of Merenre I, Pepi I's successor. In it, Maspero discovered the same hieroglyphic text on the walls he'd found in Pepi I's pyramid, and the mummy of a man in the sarcophagus of the burial chamber. This time, he visited Mariette personally, though he rejected the findings, stating on his deathbed that \"[i]n thirty years of Egyptian excavations I have never seen a pyramid whose underground rooms had hieroglyphs written on their walls.\" Throughout 1881, Maspero continued to direct investigations of other sites in Saqqara, and more texts were found in each of the pyramids of Unas, Teti and Pepi II. Maspero began publishing his findings in the \"Recueil des Travaux\" from 1882 and continued to be involved in the excavations of the pyramid in which the texts had been found until 1886.\n\nMaspero published the first corpora of the text in 1894 in French under the title \"Les inscriptions des pyramides de Saqqarah\". Translations were made by German Egyptologist Kurt Heinrich Sethe to German in 1908–1910 in \"Die altägyptischen Pyramidentexte\". The concordance that Sethe published is considered to be the standard version of the texts. Samuel A. B. Mercer published a translation into English of Sethe's work in 1952. British Egyptologist Raymond O. Faulkner presented the texts in English in 1969 in \"The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts\".\n\nGustave Jéquier conducted the first systematic investigations of Pepi II and his wives' pyramids – Neith, Iput II, and Wedjebetni – between 1926 and 1932. Jéquier also conducted the excavations of Qakare Ibi's pyramid. He later published the complete corpus of texts found in these five pyramids. Since 1958, expeditions under the directions of Jean-Philippe Lauer, Jean Sainte-Fare Garnot, and Jean Leclant have undertaken a major restoration project of the pyramids belonging to Teti, Pepi I, and Merenre I, as well as the pyramid of Unas. By 1999, the pyramid of Pepi had been opened to the public, and the debris cleared away from the pyramid while research continued under the direction of . The corpus of pyramid texts in Pepi I's pyramid were published in 2001. In 2010, the texts were discovered in Behenu's tomb.\n\nTo date, the Pyramid Texts have been discovered in the pyramids of these pharaohs and queens:\nThe spells, or utterances, of the Pyramid Texts were primarily concerned with enabling the transformation of the deceased into an Akh (where those judged worthy could mix with the gods). The spells of the Pyramid Texts are divided into two broad categories: Sacerdotal texts and Personal texts.\n\nThe sacerdotal texts are ritual in nature, and were conducted by the lector priest addressing the deceased in the second person. They consist of offering spells, short spells recited in the presentation of an offering, and recitations which are predominantly instructional. These texts appear in the Offering and Insignia Rituals, the Resurrection Ritual, and in the four pyramids containing the Morning Ritual. The writing in these texts indicates that they originated around the time of the Second and Third Dynasties.\n\nThe remaining texts are personal, and are broadly concerned with guiding the spirit out of the tomb, and into new life. They consist of provisioning, transition, and apotropaic or protective texts. The provisioning texts deal with the deceased taking command of his own food-supply, and demanding nourishment from the gods. One example of these texts is the king's response in Unas' pyramid. The transition texts otherwise known as the \"Sakhu\" or Glorifications are predominantly about the transformation of the deceased into an Akh, and their ascent, mirroring the motion of the gods, into the sky. These texts form the largest part of the corpus, and are dominated by the youngest texts composed in the Fifth and possibly Sixth Dynasties. Apotropaic texts consist of short protective spells for warding off threats to the body and tomb. Due to the archaic style of writing these texts are considered to be the oldest, and are the most difficult to interpret.\n\nThese utterances were meant to be chanted by those who were reciting them. They contained many verbs such as \"fly\" and \"leap\" depicting the actions taken by the Pharaohs to get to the afterlife. The spells delineate all of the ways the pharaoh could travel, including the use of ramps, stairs, ladders, and most importantly flying. The spells could also be used to call the gods to help, even threatening them if they did not comply. It was common for the pyramid texts to be written in the first person, but not uncommon for texts to be later changed to the third person. Often this depended on who was reciting the texts and who they were recited for. Many of the texts include accomplishments of the Pharaoh as well as the things they did for the Egyptian people during the time of their rule. These texts were used to both guide the pharaohs to the afterlife, but also inform and assure the living that the soul made it to its final destination.\n\nThe texts first appeared in the pyramid of the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, that belonging to Unas. A total of 283 spells appear on the subterranean walls of Unas' pyramid. These spells are the smallest and best-preserved corpus of the texts in the Old Kingdom. Copies of all but a single spell, PT 200, inscribed in the pyramid appeared throughout the Middle Kingdom and later, including a near-complete replica of the texts inscribed in the tomb of Senwosretankh at El-Lisht.\n\nUnas' pyramid, situated between the pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet in North Saqqara, was the smallest of those built in the Old Kingdom. It had a core built six steps high from roughly dressed limestone, encased in a layer of carefully cut fine white limestone. It had a base length of with an incline of 56° which gave the pyramid a height of . The substructure was accessed through an entrance in the pavement of a chapel on the north face of the pyramid. The entry led into a downward sloping corridor, followed by a 'corridor-chamber' with three granite portcullises that guarded the entrance into the horizontal passage. The horizontal passage ends at the antechamber of the substructure and is guarded by a fourth granite portcullis. The antechamber connects to two further rooms, a room with three recesses for holding statues called the \"serdab\" to the east, and the burial chamber with the ruler's sarcophagus to the west. The roofs of both the antechamber and burial chamber were gabled.\n\nWith the exception of the walls immediately surrounding the sarcophagus, which were lined with alabaster and painted to resemble reed mats with a wood-frame enclosure, the remaining walls of the antechamber, burial chamber and a section of the horizontal passage were covered with vertical columns of hieroglyphs that make up the Pyramid Texts. Unas' sarcophagus was left without inscription, and the king's royal titulary did not appear on the walls surrounding it as it does in later pyramids.\n\nThe west gable of the burial chamber is inscribed with protective spells; in later pyramids the gable was used for texts commending the king to Nut, and, from Pepi I onwards, also for Sakhu, or 'glorifications', for the transformation into an Akh. The other walls of the burial chamber are primarily dedicated to ritual texts. The north wall, along with the northern part of the east wall and passage, are dedicated to the Offering Ritual. Spatial considerations required part of the ritual to be spread across to other walls, and likely explains the omission of the Insignia Ritual altogether from the pyramid. The Offering Ritual, from the 'initial libation' to the 'dedication of offerings' occupies the north wall and is arrayed into three horizontal registers.\n\nKurt Sethe's first edition of the pyramid texts contained 714 distinct spells; after this publication, additional spells were discovered bringing the total to 759. No single collection uses all recorded spells.\n\nBecause of its early use, the set up and layout of the Unas pyramid were replicated and expanded on for future pyramids. The causeway ran 750 meters long and is still in good condition, unlike many causeways found in similar ancient Egyptian pyramids.\n\nIn the pyramid of Unas, the ritual texts could be found in the underlying supporting structure, while the antechamber and corridor contained texts and spells personalized to the Pharaoh himself.\n\nThe following example comes from the pyramid of Unas. It was to be recited in the South Side Burial Chamber and Passage, and it was the Invocation To New Life.\n\nUtterance 213:\n\n\"Ho, Unis! You have not gone away dead: you have gone away alive. <br> Sit on Osiris's chair, with your baton in your arm, and govern the living; <br> with your water lily scepter in your arm, and govern those <br> of the inaccessible places. <br> Your lower arms are of Atum, your upper arms of Atum, your belly of <br> Atum, your back of Atum, your rear of Atum, your legs of Atum, your <br> face of Anubis. <br> Horus's mounds shall serve you; Seth's mounds shall serve you.\"\n\nThe various pyramid texts often contained writings of rituals and offerings to the gods. Examples of these rituals are the Opening of the mouth ceremony, offering rituals, and insignia ritual. Both monetary and prayer based offerings were made in the pyramids and were written in the pyramid texts in hopes of getting the pharaoh to a desirable afterlife. Rituals such as the opening of the mouth and eye ceremony were very important for the Pharaoh in the afterlife. This ceremony involved the Kher-Heb (the chief lector priest) along with assistants opening the eyes and mouth of the dead while reciting prayers and spells. Mourners were encouraged to cry out as special instruments were used to cut holes in the mouth. After the ceremony was complete, it was believed that the dead could now eat, speak, breathe and see in the afterlife.\n\nThe Egyptian pyramids are made up of various corridors, tunnels, and rooms which have different significances and uses during the burial and ritual process. Texts were written and recited by priests in a very particular order, often starting in the Valley Temple and finishing in the Coffin or Pyramid Room. The variety of offerings and rituals were also most likely recited in a particular order. The Valley Temple often contained an offering shrine, where rituals would be recited.\n\nPyramid texts were not only found in the tombs of kings, but queens as well. Queen Neith, who was the wife of Pepi II, is one of three queens of the 6th dynasty whose tomb contains pyramid texts. The other two queens (both also thought to be wives of Pepi II) Iput II and Wedjebetni also contained tombs inscribed with texts but those of Neith have been kept in much better condition. Compared to the tombs of the kings, the layout and structure of those that belonged to these queens were much simpler. Though much simpler, the layout of the texts corresponded to similar walls and locations as those of the kings. For example, the Resurrection Ritual is found on the east end of the south wall. Due to the fact that the pyramid of Neith did not contain an antechamber, many of the spells normally written there were also written on the south wall.\n\nThe texts of Queen Neith were similar and different from those of the kings in a few additional ways. Like those of the kings, the use of both the first and third person is present in these pyramid texts. Neith's name is used throughout the texts to make them more personal. Many of the pronouns used throughout her pyramid texts are male, indicative of the parallels between the texts of the kings and queens, but a few female pronouns can be found. The texts also contain spells and utterances that are meant to be read by both the spirit herself as well as others addressing her.\n\nAfter death, the king must first rise from his tomb. Utterance 373 describes:\n\nThe texts then describe several ways for the pharaoh to reach the heavens, and one of these is by climbing a ladder. In utterance 304 the king says:\n\nAnother way is by ferry. If the boatman refuses to take him, the king has other plans:\n\nUtterances 273 and 274 are sometimes known as the \"Cannibal Hymn\", because it describes the king hunting and eating parts of the gods: They represent a discrete episode (Utterances 273-274) in the anthology of ritual texts that make up the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom period.\n\nAppearing first in the Pyramid of Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, the Cannibal Hymn preserves an early royal butchery ritual in which the deceased king—assisted by the god Shezmu—slaughters, cooks and eats the gods as sacrificial bulls, thereby incorporating in himself their divine powers in order that he might negotiate his passage into the Afterlife and guarantee his transformation as a celestial divinity ruling in the heavens.\n\nThe style and format of the Cannibal Hymn are characteristic of the oral-recitational poetry of pharaonic Egypt, marked by allusive metaphor and the exploitation of wordplay and homophony in its verbal recreation of a butchery ritual.\n\nApart from the burial of Unas, only the Pyramid of Teti displays the Cannibal Hymn.\n\nThe Cannibal Hymn later reappeared in the Coffin Texts as Spell 573. It was dropped by the time the Book of the Dead was being copied.\n\nIn the first scene of Philip Glass's opera \"Akhnaten\", the phrase \"Open are the double doors of the horizon\" is a quotation from the Pyramid Texts. More specifically, it seems to come from Utterance 220.\n\nThe American death metal band Nile made a song, \"Unas Slayer of the Gods\" which contains many references to the Pyramid Texts, including the Cannibal Hymn.\n\nIn the 2001 action-adventure movie, \"The Mummy Returns\", when Imhotep gets a jar full of dust and blows it, he quotes part of the Utterance 373 and the dust turns into mummy warriors.\n\nThe 2013 BBC programme \"Ripper Street\", Colonel Madoc Faulkner (Iain Glen) refers to a variant of Utterance 325\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866778", "title": "Nonlinear filter", "text": "Nonlinear filter\n\nIn signal processing, a nonlinear (or non-linear) filter is a filter whose output is not a linear function of its input. That is, if the filter outputs signals \"R\" and \"S\" for two input signals \"r\" and \"s\" separately, but does not always output \"αR\" + \"βS\" when the input is a linear combination \"αr\" + \"βs\".\n\nBoth continuous-domain and discrete-domain filters may be nonlinear. A simple example of the former would be an electrical device whose output voltage \"R\"(\"t\") at any moment is the square of the input voltage \"r\"(\"t\"); or which is the input clipped to a fixed range [\"a\",\"b\"], namely \"R\"(\"t\") = max(\"a\", min(\"b\", \"r\"(\"t\"))). An important example of the latter is the running-median filter, such that every output sample \"R\" is the median of the last three input samples \"r\", \"r\", \"r\". Like linear filters, nonlinear filters may be shift invariant or not.\n\nNon-linear filters have many applications, especially in the removal of certain types of noise that are not additive. For example, the median filter is widely used to remove spike noise — that affects only a small percentage of the samples, possibly by very large amounts. Indeed, all radio receivers use non-linear filters to convert kilo- to gigahertz signals to the audio frequency range; and all digital signal processing depends on non-linear filters (analog-to-digital converters) to transform analog signals to binary numbers.\n\nHowever, nonlinear filters are considerably harder to use and design than linear ones, because the most powerful mathematical tools of signal analysis (such as the impulse response and the frequency response) cannot be used on them. Thus, for example, linear filters are often used to remove noise and distortion that was created by nonlinear processes, simply because the proper non-linear filter would be too hard to design and construct.\n\nFrom the foregoing, we can know that the nonlinear filters have quite different behavior compared to linear filters. The most important characteristic is that, for nonlinear filters, the filter output or response of the filter does not obey the principles outlined earlier, particularly scaling and shift invariance. Furthermore, a nonlinear filter can produce results that vary in a non-intuitive manner.\n\nSeveral principles define a linear system. The basic definition of linearity is that the output must be a linear function of the inputs, that is \nfor any scalar values formula_2 and formula_3.\nThis is a fundamental property of linear system design, and is known as superposition. So, a system is said to be nonlinear if this equation is not valid. That is to say, when the system is linear, the superposition principle can be applied. This important fact is the reason that the techniques of linear-system analysis have been so well developed.\n\nSignals often get corrupted during transmission or processing; and a frequent goal in filter design is the restoration of the original signal, a process commonly called \"noise removal\". The simplest type of corruption is additive noise, when the desired signal \"S\" gets added with an unwanted signal \"N\" that has no known connection with \"S\". If the noise \"N\" has a simple statistical description, such as Gaussian noise, then a Kalman filter will reduce \"N\" and restore \"S\" to the extent allowed by Shannon's theorem. In particular, if \"S\" and \"N\" do not overlap in the frequency domain, they can be completely separated by linear bandpass filters.\n\nFor almost any other form of noise, on the other hand, some sort of non-linear filter will be needed for maximum signal recovery. For multiplicative noise (that gets multiplied by the signal, instead of added to it), for example, it may suffice to convert the input to a logarithmic scale, apply a linear filter, and then convert the result to linear scale. In this example, the first and third steps are not linear.\n\nNon-linear filters may also be useful when certain \"nonlinear\" features of the signal are more important than the overall information contents. In digital image processing, for example, one may wish to preserve the sharpness of silhouette edges of objects in photographs, or the connectivity of lines in scanned drawings. A linear noise-removal filter will usually blur those features; a non-linear filter may give more satisfactory results (even if the blurry image may be more \"correct\" in the information-theoretic sense).\n\nMany nonlinear noise-removal filters operate in the time domain. They typically examine the input digital signal within a finite window surrounding each sample, and use some statistical inference model (implicitly or explicitly) to estimate the most likely value for the original signal at that point. The design of such filters is known as the filtering problem for a stochastic process in estimation theory and control theory.\nExamples of nonlinear filters include:\n\n\nNonlinear filter also occupy a decisive position in the image processing functions. In a typical pipeline for real-time image processing, it is common to have many nonlinear filter included to form, shape, detect, and manipulate image information. Furthermore, each of these filter types can be parameterized to work one way under certain circumstances and another way under a different set of circumstance using adaptive filter rule generation. The goals vary from noise removal to feature abstraction. Filtering image data is a standard process used in almost all image processing systems. Nonlinear filters are the most utilized forms of filter construction. For example, if an image contains a low amount of noise but with relatively high magnitude, then a median filter may be more appropriate.\n\nThe problem of optimal nonlinear filtering was solved in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Ruslan L. Stratonovich and Harold J. Kushner.\n\nThe Kushner–Stratonovich solution is a stochastic partial differential equation. In 1969, Moshe Zakai introduced a simplified dynamics for the unnormalized conditional law of the filter known as Zakai equation.\nIt has been proved by Mireille Chaleyat-Maurel and Dominique Michel that the solution is infinite dimensional in general, and as such requires finite dimensional approximations. These may be heuristics-based such as the extended Kalman filter or the assumed density filters described by Peter S. Maybeck or the projection filters introduced by Damiano Brigo, Bernard Hanzon and François Le Gland, some sub-families of which are shown to coincide with the assumed density filters.\n\nEnergy transfer filters are a class of nonlinear dynamic filters that can be used to move energy in a designed manner. Energy can be moved to higher or lower frequency bands, spread over a designed range, or focused. Many energy transfer filter designs are possible, and these provide extra degrees of freedom in filter design that are just not possible using linear designs.\n\n\n"}

Olsen Energy subsidiary, and in 2009 contracted by BP for drilling in the United Kingdom section of the North Sea for three years. It is registered in Hamilton, Bermuda.\n\nThe rig has suffered some serious accidents, most notably an explosive decompression in 1983 that killed four divers and one dive tender, and badly injured another dive tender.\n\n\"Byford Dolphin\" drilling rig is an Enhanced Aker H-3 design which was built by Aker Group at the Aker Verdal shipyard in 1974. Between 1974 and 1978, it was named Deep Sea Driller.\n\n\"Byford Dolphin\" has a length of , breadth of and depth of . It has a maximum drilling depth of , and it could operate at a water depth of . As a drilling rig, \"Byford Dolphin\" is equipped with advanced drilling equipment and has to meet strict levels of certification under Norwegian law. \"Byford Dolphin\" is able to maneuver with its own engines (to counter drift and ocean currents), but for long-distance relocation, it must be moved by specialist tugboats.\n\nOn 1 March 1976, the rig ran aground during transit from a block in the North Sea to Bergen. All crew were evacuated in the life boats, but six people died when they fell from their life boat.\n\nOn Saturday, 5 November 1983 at 4:00 a.m., while drilling in the Frigg gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, four divers were in a diving chamber system on the rig's deck that was connected by a trunk (a short passage) to a diving bell. The divers were Edwin Arthur Coward (British, 35 years old), Roy P. Lucas (British, 38), Bjørn Giæver Bergersen (Norwegian, 29) and Truls Hellevik (Norwegian, 34). They were assisted by two dive tenders, William Brown Crammond and Martin Andrew Saunders.\n\nHellevik was about to close the door between the chamber system and the trunk when the chamber explosively decompressed from a pressure of nine atmospheres to one atmosphere. One of the tenders, 32-year-old William Crammond of Great Britain, and all four of the divers were killed instantly; the other tender, Saunders, was severely injured.\nJust prior to the event, decompression chambers 1 and 2 were connected via a trunk to a diving bell. This connection was sealed by a clamp operated by Crammond and Saunders, who were experienced divers. A third chamber was connected to this system but was not involved. Coward and Lucas were resting in chamber 2 at a pressure of 9 atm. The diving bell with Bergersen and Hellevik had just been winched up after a dive and joined to the trunk. Leaving their wet equipment in the trunk, the two divers climbed through the trunk into chamber 1.\n\nThe normal procedure would have been:\n\n\nThe first two steps had been completed when, for an unknown reason, Crammond opened the clamp before Diver 4 (Hellevik) could close the door to the chamber. This resulted in the explosive decompression of the unsealed chamber. Air rushed out of the chamber with tremendous force, jamming the interior trunk door and pushing the bell away, striking the two tenders. Crammond was killed while Saunders was severely injured.\n\nMedical investigations were carried out on the remains of the four divers and of one of the tenders. The most notable finding was the presence of large amounts of fat in large arteries and veins and in the cardiac chambers, as well as intravascular fat in organs, especially the liver. This fat was unlikely to be embolic, but must have precipitated from the blood \"in situ\". The autopsy suggested that rapid bubble formation in the blood denatured the lipoprotein complexes, rendering the lipids insoluble. The blood of the three divers left intact inside the chambers likely boiled instantly, stopping their circulation. The fourth diver was dismembered and mutilated by the blast forcing him out through the partially blocked doorway and would have died instantly.\n\nCoward, Lucas, and Bergersen were exposed to the effects of explosive decompression and died in the positions indicated by the diagram. Investigation by forensic pathologists determined that Hellevik, being exposed to the highest pressure gradient and in the process of moving to secure the inner door, was forced through the diameter opening created by the jammed interior trunk door by escaping air and violently dismembered, including bisection of his thoracoabdominal cavity, which resulted in expulsion of all of the internal organs of his chest and abdomen, except the trachea and a section of small intestine, and of the thoracic spine. These were projected some distance, one section being found vertically above the exterior pressure door.\n\nThe committee investigating the accident concluded that it was caused by human error on the part of the dive tender who opened the clamp. It is not clear whether the tender who opened the clamp before the trunk was depressurized did so by order of his supervisor, on his own initiative, or because of miscommunication. At the time, the only communication the tenders on the outside of the chamber system had was through a bullhorn attached to the wall surface; with heavy noise from the rig and sea, it was hard to listen in on what was going on. Fatigue from many hard hours of work also took its toll among the divers, who often worked 16-hour shifts. \n\nThis incident was also attributed to engineering failure. The obsolete \"Byford Dolphin\" diving system, dating from 1975, was not equipped with fail-safe hatches, outboard pressure gauges, and an interlocking mechanism, which would have prevented the trunk from being opened while the system was under pressure. Prior to the accident, Norske Veritas had issued the following rule for certification: \"Connecting mechanisms between bell and chambers are to be so arranged that they cannot be operated when the trunk is pressurized,\" therefore requiring such systems to have fail-safe seals and interlocking mechanisms. One month after the accident, Norske Veritas and the Norwegian oil directorate made the rule final for all bell systems.\n\nAmong others, former crew members of \"Byford Dolphin\" and NOPEF (a Norwegian oil and petro-chemical union) have come forward and claimed the investigation was a cover-up. They claimed that the commission investigating the accident did not mention in their report the irresponsible dispensations on vital equipment requested by Comex and authorized by the diving section to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, which played a vital role in the accident's occurrence. They also alleged the accident was due to a lack of proper equipment, including clamping mechanisms equipped with interlocking mechanisms (which would be impossible to open while the chamber system was still under pressure), outboard pressure gauges, and a safe communication system, all of which had been held back because of dispensations by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.\n\nThe conclusions of the investigation were disputed, and a group of divers gathered evidence with the intention to \"find justice for all of the crew of \"Byford Dolphin\".\" The group formed the North Sea Divers Alliance in the early 1990s and since then has campaigned for compensation for divers killed or injured in the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea.\n\nThe North Sea Divers Alliance, formed by early North Sea divers and the relatives of those killed, continued to press for further investigation and, in February 2008, obtained a report that indicated the real cause was faulty equipment. Clare Lucas, daughter of Roy Lucas, said: \"I would go so far as to say that the Norwegian Government murdered my father because they knew that they were diving with an unsafe decompression chamber.\" The families of the divers eventually received compensation for the damages from the Norwegian government 26 years after the incident.\n\nOn 17 April 2002, a 44-year-old Norwegian worker on the rig was struck on the head and killed in an industrial accident. The accident resulted in \"Byford Dolphin\" losing an exploration contract with Statoil, which expressed concerns with the rig's operating procedures. The incident cost the company millions of dollars in lost income.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her stint in World Championship Wrestling under the ring name Asya.\n\nPrior to her professional wrestling career, Wolf was originally a model for bikinis and Hawaiian Tropic. While modeling, Wolf began bodybuilding and won several titles on both the state and national level.\n\nIn March 1999, Wolf began appearing as a head nurse to tend to Ric Flair when he was (in storyline) put into a mental institution. She then appeared in several vignettes with him before becoming his valet upon his return to WCW. On the May 3, 1999 episode of \"Nitro\", the Head Nurse accompanied Flair to the ring as he then called out \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, whom he was feuding with. When Savage and his own valet, Gorgeous George, came out to the ring, Flair called security on Savage, resulting in George being choked out by the Head Nurse.\n\nThe nurse was introduced as Double D when she, along with Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Samantha, accompanied Flair's son David to his United States Heavyweight Championship contest against Dean Malenko at the Bash at the Beach. During the match, Double D confronted Anderson, who got into the ring. Malenko intervened and, hesitating to hit a woman, instead locked her into his cloverleaf submission hold. Ric Flair took the opportunity to hit Malenko with the U.S. title belt to allow David to pin Malenko to retain the title.\n\nOn October 25 at Halloween Havoc, The Filthy Animals showed a video of them kidnapping Ric Flair and leaving him in the desert. After the video, they were attacked in the ring by Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko, who were members of the Revolution. The Animals' manager, Torrie Wilson, was kidnapped by Double D, who was introduced as Asya, the newest member of the Revolution. The name change was in reference to Chyna, who competed for WCW's rival the World Wrestling Federation, as well as implying that Asya was superior to Chyna since \"Asia\" is bigger than \"China\". Later on in the show, when the Filthy Animals attacked Malenko during a match against Chris Benoit, the Revolution used Torrie to blackmail the Animals into retreating.\n\nOn the November 8 episode of \"Nitro\", Asya made her in-ring debut as she and Malenko defeated Rey Misterio, Jr. and Torrie Wilson in a mixed tag team match. Three days later, on \"Thunder\", the Revolution interfered in a match between Sid and Perry Saturn before being taken down by Sid. Asya stood up to Sid, who attempted to powerbomb her but was attacked by Rick Steiner. The following week on \"Nitro\", Asya defeated Kimberly Page by disqualification with rival Torrie Wilson as guest referee. Post-match, Asya confronted Torrie only to be slapped by her. Asya responded by throwing her out of the ring. Page then tried to help Torrie by jumping on Asya's back to apply a sleeper hold only for Asya to snapmare her down. Later on in the show, Kimberly attempted to choke Asya out with her belt, leading to Asya's former ally David Flair coming out with a crowbar in hand to ward off Kimberly. In a twist, Asya hit David with a sidewalk slam before trying to hit him with his own crowbar. Flair recovered and then suplexed her before hitting Revolution member Shane Douglas with his crowbar before leaving the ring.\n\nThe feud between the Filthy Animals and the Revolution concluded on November 21 at the Mayhem pay-per-view as Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko, and Asya defeated Eddie Guerrero, Billy Kidman, and Torrie Wilson in an elimination match, although Asya was the third competitor eliminated from the match.\n\nFollowing the feud with the Filthy Animals, Asya began a string of several short-lived feuds. On the December 6 episode of \"Nitro\", she wrestled fellow bodybuilder-turned-wrestler Midnight to a no contest. Following the match, Asya attacked Midnight until the Revolution came out and attacked Midnight with their flag. Three days later on \"Thunder\", Asya fought \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan to a no contest. Asya finished her feud with Midnight as she, Saturn and Malenko defeated Midnight and Harlem Heat the following week on \"Nitro\". At Starrcade, the Revolution (Shane Douglas, Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko, and Asya) defeated Jim Duggan and the newly reunited Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Rick Steiner, and Mike Rotunda) after the Club turned on Duggan during the match. On the December 23 episode of \"Thunder\", Asya, Saturn, and Malenko lost to Billy Kidman, Eddie Guerrero and Jim Duggan.\n\nOn the January 6, 2000 episode of \"Thunder\", Asya challenged Cruiserweight Champion Madusa for her title, but lost after the Revolution turned on her. Asya then feuded with the Revolution during house shows, teaming up with Chavo Guerrero, Jr. against Malenko and Saturn, losing to them twice before defeating them twice to end the feud.\n\nOn January 10, Oklahoma made misogynistic comments before saying that he could beat any woman in the ring and that he would go on to beat Cruiserweight Champion Madusa. In response, Asya came out to the ring and gave Oklahoma a beating before Madusa came out. Six days later at Souled Out, Asya and former Nitro Girl Spice attacked Oklahoma during his title match with Madusa. Oklahoma managed to roll up Madusa for the win but after the match, Asya and Madusa poured barbecue sauce over him.\n\nAfter this, Asya began making sporadic appearances. On the April 15 episode of \"WorldWide\", Asya lost to Mona via disqualification after Little Genie interfered. Post-match, both Asya and Genie attacked Mona before being pulled off by referees. On the May 3 episode of \"Thunder\", both Mona and Asya were the only females in a battle royal between the Millionaire's Club and the New Blood to determine a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, but they were both eliminated early on.\n\nOn the June 14 episode of \"Thunder\", Asya returned to WCW television disguised as a Sting fan at ringside. When Vampiro told her to remove her mask, she responded by spitting a red liquid into his face. Vampiro's opponent, The Demon (Dale Torborg), then appeared in the ring and the announcers revealed that The Demon and Asya were legit engaged. After Vampiro defeated the Demon, Asya tried to help her fiance but received a \"Nail in the Coffin\" from Vampiro. The Demon chased Vampiro away before tending to Asya in the ring and later retired his Demon gimmick. Five days later on \"Nitro\", Vampiro called out Torborg and asked him \"don't you have something missing in your life?\", leaving Torborg puzzled by the question before the lights went out. Asya, who had accompanied Torborg, disappeared, prompting Torborg to go after Vampiro. The lights went out again and Vampiro also disappeared, escaping in a black hearse. On the June 21 episode of \"Thunder\", Torborg attacked Vampiro, demanding to know where Asya was. Instead, Vampiro told him he would never know unless he became the Demon again. Torborg then followed Vampiro to a gravesite that Vampiro said Asya was in there. Vampiro hit Torborg with a shovel before getting Asya out of the trunk of his hearse.\n\nOn the June 28 episode of \"Thunder\", Vampiro came out proclaiming to have gotten rid of Sting, whom he was also feuding with, as well as Torborg and Asya. During his promo, the lights went out and Asya appeared in the ring before spitting a red liquid in his face as she did weeks prior. Torborg then attacked Vampiro with a baseball bat as the lights went out again and both Asya and Torborg were gone. The following week on \"Nitro\", Asya was injured (in storyline) by an explosion during her entrance to the ring. Torborg wanted to tend to Asya in the hospital when a hooded figure (later revelaed as Vampiro) handed him the Demon costume.\n\nOn August 25, 2000, Wolf was released from her WCW contract.\n\nWolf graduated with a degree in biotechnology. Wolf married Dale Torborg on October 5, 2000. The couple had their first child, a daughter named Sierra Raye, on August 18, 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

A. Benson and coworkers discovered a new sulfur-containing lipid in plants and identified it as sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG). The sulfolipid structure was defined as 1,2-di-\"O\"-acyl-3-O-(6-deoxy-6-sulfo-α--glucopyranosyl)-\"sn\"-glycerol (SQDG). The distinctive feature of this substance is carbon bonded directly to sulfur as C-SO. Sulfonic acids of this type are chemically stable and strong acids.\n\nSQDGs have been found in all photosynthetic plants, algae, cyanobacteria, purple sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria and is localised in the thylakoid membranes, being the most saturated glycolipid.\n\nSQDGs have been found to be closely associated with certain membrane proteins. In some cases the (electrostatic) interactions may be very strong, as suggested by the inability of saturated SQDG molecules associated with purified chloroplast CF0-CF1 ATPase to exchange with other acidic lipids. It was shown also that SQDGs protect CF1 against cold inactivation in the presence of some ATP. CF1 bound to membranes was found to be much more resistant to heat and cold than solubilised protein. Mitochondrial coupling factor F1 is similarly protected by phospholipids and SQDGs although, in that case, both were equally effective.\n\nInformation about SQDG and the Rieske protein interaction in the cyt b6f structures is also present. SQDGs seem to be involved in the turnover of cyt f in a similar manner like D1 and raises the question of whether a similar mechanism underlies the role of SQDG in the assembly of both subunits.\n\nExtensive SQDG accumulation was observed in apple shoot bark and wood (Okanenko, 1977) and in pine thylakoid during the autumn hardening, while heat and drought action upon wheat, at NaCl action in the halophyte \"Aster tripolium\".\n\nSQDG also inhibits viral development by interfering with DNA-polymerase and reverse transcriptase activity.\n\nIn cyanobacteria and plants, SQDG is synthesized in two steps. First, UDP-glucose and sulfite are combined by UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase (SQD1) to produce UDP-sulfoquinovose. Second, the sulfoquinovose portion of UDP-sulfoquinovose is transferred to diacylglycerol by the glycosyltransferase SQDG synthase, to form SQDG .\n\nSQDGs degrade during sulfur starvation in some species such as \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\". This response is for the redistribution of its sulfur to make new protein. A wide range of bacteria cleave SQDG to form sulfoquinovose, and then metabolize the sulfoquinovose through a process termed sulfoglycolysis. SQDG are cleaved by enzymes termed sulfoquinovosidases.\n\n"}

He went on to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a B.S. in 1966, and in 1971 a Ph.D. (astronomy) from the University of Maryland (supervisor: Frank Kerr).\n\nIn 2012, Sullivan received the LeRoy E. Doggett Prize from the American Astronomical Society's Historical Astronomy Division for his career contributions to the field of the history of astronomy, in particular his work on the history of early radio astronomy, culminating in his book \"Cosmic Noise: A History of Early Radio Astronomy\" (2009).\n\nIn order to sample the radio signature of Earth from an external site and thus test whether TV broadcasting is in fact the principal component, Sullivan and S. H. Knowles used the Moon as a passive reflector of Earth's radio frequency leakage. Using the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope, a wide range of frequencies were scanned between 100 and 400 MHz. After local interference was eliminated (using an on-Moon, off-Moon technique), the frequencies of most observed signals could be identified with the television AM video carriers of various nationalities.

She opened her own yoga studio in Portland.\n\nPoch debuted in 1988 as Taylor Made, a valet for Scotty the Body in Portland's Pacific Northwest Wrestling.\n\nShe joined the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association (LPWA) in 1990 as Terri Power, defeating both Leilani Kai and Judy Martin within her first year with the company. On February 23, 1992 at \"Super Ladies Showdown\" in Rochester, Minnesota in the Mayo Civic Center she defeated Lady X for the LPWA Championship. She was never defeated for the title, as the LPWA ceased operations shortly after her victory. She also teamed with Reggie Bennett during their mutual stint with the short-lived organization.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Poch began wrestling for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling. She competed in the Japan Grand Prix, finishing ninth, and the Fuji Network tag team tournament with Kyoko Inoue as her partner. She remained in Japan until 1993, when she took a hiatus from wrestling.\n\nIn 1998, Poch was hired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). She debuted on the December 28 episode of \"Raw\" entering the ring before a match to hand Sable a yellow rose. She continued in becoming an obsessed fan over the next few weeks, constantly at ringside during Sable's matches. At the Royal Rumble, she helped Sable defeat Luna Vachon in a strap match. She later introduced herself as Tori and tried to gain the respect of Sable, who continually degraded and humiliated her. As a result, Tori challenged Sable to a match for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania XV, which Sable won following interference from her bodyguard, Nicole Bass.\n\nTori feuded with Jacqueline in April and May 1999 and then began pursuing Ivory's Women's Championship in July. After Ivory defeated Tori at SummerSlam, their feud became more and more heated, leading to the first ever WWF women's Hardcore match on the September 6, 1999 edition of \"Raw\". Ivory retained her title once more in a match which involved Tori having a mirror smashed over her head and being burnt with an iron. On September 26, Tori attempted to gain a measure of retribution by attacking Ivory during a match, but instead was pushed into a crate by Ivory.\n\nTori returned in November and soon became the on-screen girlfriend of Kane. On December 16, Tori complained to Triple H and Stephanie McMahon about Kane, by now feuding with his former tag team partner X-Pac, an ally of Triple H, being placed in a Handicap match. Stephanie retorted by challenging Tori to a match that night, which she accepted. Stephanie, however, replaced herself with X-Pac, who defeated Tori with ease as Kane was ambushed backstage by the Mean Street Posse. Kane received a shot at the WWF Championship on December 20 but with the stipulation that, if he lost to incumbent Big Show, Tori would have to spend the Christmas weekend with X-Pac. Kane lost after the New Age Outlaws distracted him. Tori insisted upon her return, however, that X-Pac had been a perfect gentleman. Around the same time, Tori began to become paranoid, and grew hysterical after Test hugged her. Kane promptly destroyed Test in the ring, believing Tori's claims that he had harassed her. Other wrestlers began to exploit Tori's neuroticism, using it to unleash Kane on their enemies. This included Mankind, who manipulated the duo into attacking a fake Mankind hired by Triple H, and Chyna, who manipulated Tori to get Kane to attack Chris Jericho.\n\nKane continued to feud with X-Pac, and on January 27, 2000 he was ambushed in the ring by the McMahon-Helmsley Faction when tricking him into joining DX X-Pac's allies. After tying Kane up, X-Pac revealed that Tori was now his girlfriend. Tori began accompanying X-Pac and his partner Road Dogg to the ring, becoming a member of the new D-Generation X in a brief heel turn. She helped X-Pac defeat Kane at No Way Out, but was unable to stop Kane from defeating him at WrestleMania 2000 and was also given a Stink Face from Rikishi during the match. Additionally, she helped Stephanie McMahon win the Women's Championship from Jacqueline in March. At the King of the Ring in June, Tori, X-Pac, and Road Dogg participated in a table and dumpster match against the Dudley Boyz that ended with the Dudleyz powerbombing her through a table. Poch was sidelined with a torn labrum on June 24. She underwent surgery with Dr. James Andrews. On the October 30 edition of \"Raw\", Tori returned in a segment at WWF New York, confronting and slapping X-Pac due to the events at King of the Ring.\n\nPoch returned in January 2001 as The Black Ninja, a masked villainess in a black bodysuit who helped Raven retain the Hardcore Championship. Raven's Hardcore title feud with Crash Holly, led to a feud between The Ninja and Crash's on-screen cousin Molly Holly. Holly finally unmasked the ninja on the March 11, 2001 episode of Sunday Night HEAT, revealing her to be Tori. Subsequently, Poch's character was removed from television.\n\nAfter working as a trainer on WWF Tough Enough throughout the summer of 2001, Poch was released by the WWF in September 2001. At the time, she made accusations about Scott Levy (Raven), claiming he had verbally abused her. WWF road agent Gerald Brisco and Executive Vice President of Talent Relations Jim Ross claimed, however, that these allegations were not true.\n\nShe subsequently retired from wrestling to concentrate on her career as a yogini.\n\nBefore beginning a career in professional wrestling, Poch worked as a bodybuilder and fitness model. Following her release from the WWF, she has been working as a yogini and currently runs a yoga studio in Portland.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866811", "title": "Songtan", "text": "Songtan\n\nSongtan is an area in the northern end of Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggido, South Korea. Songtan achieved city status in its own right in 1981, five years earlier than Pyeongtaek, but merged, along with Pyeongtaek County, into Pyeongtaek City in May 1995. Most residents still consider it to have an identity separate from the rest of Pyeongtaek City. To appease some discontent at the merger Pyeongtaek city officials decided to keep the Songtan City Hall intact and convert it into a branch office of the Pyeongtak City Hall, as shown in the picture above, where Songtan residents can still go for city provided services. At consolidation, Songtan had over 110,000 residents, slightly less than the population of pre-consolidation Pyeongtaek City. The district has an administrative office which formerly served as Songtan City Hall. Songtan's best known feature is Osan Air Base, a United States Air Force base which spawned the growth of the area and is a major factor in the district's economy.\n\nSongtan Station and Seojeong-ri Station serve Songtan, and connect Songtan to Seoul and other cities like: Cheonan, Osan, Suwon, and Anyang via the Seoul Metropolitan Subway on Seoul Subway Line 1 . In addition to regular subway trains, Seojeong-ri Station features some Korail trains and Seoul Subway Line 1 Express subway trains. Pyeongtaek Station is two stops south of Seojeong-ri Station on Seoul Subway Line 1 and has a larger Korail Station.\n\n\nOsan Air Base is a forward deployed base of the United States Air Force. Osan City lies ten miles north of Songtan, but was the closest settlement of appreciable size when the base was built in 1951–52. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that Osan was chosen as the name because the names of nearby hamlets were difficult to pronounce (Seojong-ri was the closest town that existed at the time, two miles south). Osan hosts U.S. Air Force and Republic of Korea Air Force units.\n\nSongtan continues to grow southward and eastward from the base and is now a major bedroom community for Seoul and Suwon workers. Hundreds of large multi-story apartment buildings house these commuters.\n\nFarther away from the base, Songtan appears as any other city in Gyeonggi-do, with high-rise apartments stretching to the south. Cityscape gives way to rural farmlands immediately west and about two miles east of the base. From the downtown bus station, buses run to Seoul, which is roughly 45 minutes north. In 2005 the subway/train line from Seoul connected to Cheonan, with a station in Songtan. Songtan connects to many other cities: Osan, Suwon, and Seoul to the north; and Pyeongtaek, Cheonan, and Daejeon to the south.\n\nThere is a sizable foreign population; American military, Filipino and, before 9/11 Russian, reside in the immediate vicinity of the base with an increasing Chinese presence of small merchants.\n\nImmediately outside the base is a district with many bars, dance clubs, small shops, relator's offices and restaurants. This area is commonly referred to by foreigners as \"downtown\" or \"the Ville\" but is officially known as Sinjang-dong Shopping Mall.\n\nOn weekends the streets are crowded with local residents, tourists, shoppers, military members (U.S and R.O.K.) and general partiers clogging the streets and enjoying the \"festive\" atmosphere. Famous for hostesses called \"Juicy girls\" who supply drinks to the customers, most downtown bars feature pool, darts, loud American music (mainly hip-hop, rock, and classic rock) and hookahs as the main attractions. Dart and pool leagues are somewhat popular among the military population. There is a growing music scene at bars that have local bands play on weekend nights.\n\nSmall shops are a large part of the Shinjang area. In 1996 a portion of the main street leading off Osan AB was remade into a pedestrian mall, the Shinjang Shopping Mall. Some Americans are eager to buy custom-made clothing at prices somewhat cheaper than in the U.S. from the skilled artisans who line the mall. There are also leather workers and painters, hanji, traditional Korean souvenirs, and blanket shops which cater to the Americans. Customers may haggle with the shop owners to obtain the best deal, and the shop owners are usually willing to do the same.\n\nSome of the businesses are well-known food chains like McDonald's, Popeyes and Baskin-Robbins; however, most are small, individually owned shops, restaurants, and bars. Lining the middle of the pedestrian mall and streets are pojangmacha (small tents and carts) offering traditional Korean street foods such as \"hotteok\", \"tteokbokki\", \"mandu\", and \"dakkochi\" (skewered chicken) better known in the area as chicken-on-a-stick. There are also small vendor tables selling colorful socks, hats, masks, tee-shirts, and other items and 'gray-market' tents selling copied DVDs.\n\nSinjang-dong Shopping Mall is unique from many shopping strips in Korea because of its relatively large American/foreign presence. Thus, most stores, restaurants, and establishments are bilingual (English/Korean) and many accept US dollars as well as South Korean won.\n\nBefore June 2013 Sinjang-dong Shopping Mall was known as a seedy collection of \"Juicy\" bars that catered exclusively to American military. It was filled with Filipina and, in smaller numbers, Russian and Korean \"Juicy\" girls who worked as hostesses or dancers in bars to provide company and, in some cases, sexual services to patrons in exchange for the patron buying the girl juice drinks priced 10,000 won and higher. Following a crack-down by United States Forces Korea (USFK) officials, those establishments that got out of the juicy bar business have remade themselves into dance clubs and sports bars. Some are thriving, but some have closed as the 140 bars in Songtan battle for the patronage of area servicemen.\n\nThose that chose to remain in the Juicy bar business have been placed off limits to military personnel. The military authorities have no jurisdiction over the private businesses off base. However, they can order the service members under their jurisdiction to not do business with those who do not meet particular standards. Being put off limits can mean that a business loses nearly all of its customers, so many owners begrudgingly comply with the base's requirements. Many owners have complained that essentially this gives the US military de facto authority over the Korean businesses.\n\nSong's Plaques and Coins shop in the Sinjang Shopping Mall supplies a large portion of the challenge coins used throughout the US military.\n"}

He was also the 2011 SmackDown Money in the Bank winner, the 2013 Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner and the SmackDown General Manager from July 18, 2016 to April 10, 2018. Bryan is the 26th Triple Crown Champion and the 15th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history and headlined several major pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania XXX.\n\nDanielson was previously signed to WWE, then known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), for an 18-month period from 2000–2001, and made additional uncontracted appearances for the promotion until 2003. Prior to joining WWE for his third stint in 2009, Danielson wrestled for various companies internationally using both his real name and the ring name American Dragon, which later became his nickname. David Shoemaker of ESPN's \"Grantland\" noted that Danielson \"was widely regarded as the best wrestler in the world before he got the call-up from WWE\". He wrestled for Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2002 to 2009, being recognized as a \"Founding Father\" of the promotion, where he was a one-time ROH World Champion and one-time Pure Wrestling Champion, at some point unifying both titles. He was the first winner of ROH's annual Survival of the Fittest tournament in 2004.\n\nDanielson also wrestled extensively in Japan, winning the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship in Pro Wrestling Noah and the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Curry Man) in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Between WWE, ROH and Japanese promotions, he held a dozen total championships. Danielson also won numerous titles on the independent circuit, including two PWG World Championships, the FIP Heavyweight Championship and the wXw World Heavyweight Championship. From May 2014 to December 2014 and from April 2015 to March 2018, Bryan was either injured or recovering from injury. In February 2016, Danielson retired from professional wrestling due to medical issues (including seizures) arising from multiple concussions and a brain lesion. That July, he became the SmackDown General Manager following the return of the brand extension. In March 2018, Bryan was formally cleared by doctors and returned to in-ring competition at WrestleMania 34. He regained the WWE Championship for the first time in four years later that November.\n\nBryan Lloyd Danielson was born on May 22, 1981, in Aberdeen, Washington, the son of a lumberjack and a therapist. His parents got divorced when he was young. During his childhood, Danielson was shown a professional wrestling magazine by a friend and since became a fan of wrestling. He considered himself antisocial in high school but competed in sports such as American football.\n\nDanielson has cited a number of wrestlers as influences to his style including Toshiaki Kawada, Mitsuharu Misawa, and William Regal. He has also made mention of modeling his wrestling on that of Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit in his early career, then using Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a platform to develop his own style.\n\nDuring his sophomore year of high school, Danielson decided to pursue a pro wrestling career and attempted to train at Dean Malenko's wrestling school in Florida. However, by the time he graduated from school in 1999, Malenko's school had closed down. Following a friend's suggestion, he instead began training under Rudy Gonzalez and veteran wrestler Shawn Michaels at the Texas Wrestling Academy (TWA) in San Antonio, Texas. After his wrestling debut in December 1999, Danielson toured Japan with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) alongside Lance Cade, a fellow trainee from the TWA, and they competed in several tag team matches. He won the TWA Tag Team Championship with Spanky in March 2000, but they dropped the titles back to Jeremy Sage and Ruben Cruz two weeks later.\n\nWhile touring the country's independent circuit, Danielson was signed to a developmental deal by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to work in their developmental system and was assigned to Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW), where he gained exposure and was trained by WWF competitor William Regal, whom he credited as being instrumental in the development of his career. During this time, he adopted his moniker of the \"American Dragon\". WWF severed its ties with MCW in 2001, but not before Danielson won the MCW Light Heavyweight Championship and the MCW Tag Team Championship with Spanky. After 18 months with the company, he was released from his WWF contract in July 2001. Danielson revealed in his 2015 autobiography that he was close to being called up to the main roster during the 2001 Royal Rumble match: he explained that the WWF thought of using him as one of their key figures in the newly created cruiserweight division, which was inspired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\n\nDanielson went to Japan after his release from the WWF, competing in Japan's premier promotion, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he used his American Dragon persona and donned a red, white and blue mask reminiscent of a dragon. As a part of the junior heavyweight division, Danielson had success in both singles and tag team competition in the company, winning (without wearing a mask) the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship with Curry Man on March 12, 2004.\n\nIn 2002, Danielson wrestled two matches for the renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) despite not being a contracted performer for the company. He was quickly defeated by both Sean O'Haire and Little Guido in his two appearances. He went on to make four additional non-contracted appearances for WWE in 2003 on its secondary shows, \"Velocity\" and \"Heat\", initially as enhancement talent before being allowed to compete in longer matches; he wrestled Jamie Noble at a \"Velocity\" taping in January, Rico at a \"Heat\" taping in February, John Cena at a \"Velocity\" taping also in February, and made his final appearance in November in a tag team match against Paul London and Spanky at a \"Velocity\" taping, in which he was partnered with John Walters. This was his final appearance for the promotion for over five years.\n\nIn 2002, Danielson joined the independent promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is acknowledged as a \"Founding Father\" of the company. On February 22, he competed in the main event of the company's debut event, The Era of Honor Begins, in a three-way match against Christopher Daniels and Low Ki. One of his matches with Austin Aries, performed on August 7, 2004 at Testing the Limit, lasted seventy-four minutes before Aries was finally declared the victor. One of the more notable rivalries he had in the early years in the company was with Homicide, as the two fought numerous matches with a variety of stipulations, culminating in a steel cage match on May 13, 2005 at The Final Showdown, where Danielson was victorious.\n\nDespite winning the company's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament in 2004, Bryan did not win a ROH title. In 2005, Danielson explained in the company's newsletter, \"The ROH Newswire\", that he had quit ROH after being frustrated by his inability to defeat Austin Aries for the ROH World Championship. It was later revealed Danielson had become frustrated in general with professional wrestling and planned to take some time off to evaluate his career options. However, Danielson had several dates booked in Europe and Japan, leading fans to believe that the periodical was likely a storyline claim for Danielson's absence during this period.\n\nDanielson defeated James Gibson for the ROH World Championship at Glory by Honor IV on September 15, 2005. The rest of the year saw Danielson have successful title defenses even against wrestlers from other companies, such as Pro Wrestling Noah star Naomichi Marufuji at Final Battle on December 17.\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, Chris Hero, a representative from Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), invaded ROH and targeted Danielson—the two exchanged words over the internet before having a match together, with nearly the entire roster of both companies embarking on an interpromotional feud. Danielson became personally invested in this feud and invaded CZW himself, which led to him having physical altercations with a number of CZW wrestlers. Hero intensified the rivalry, leading to the two wrestling at ROH's Hell Freezes Over event on January 14, where Danielson successfully defended the ROH World Championship. On July 15 at Death Before Dishonor IV, he soon filled the vacant slot on ROH's five-man team which participated in one of CZW's more popular attractions, a steel cage match called the Cage of Death, a ten-man tag team match in which a man from each team starts in the cage and a random wrestler enters periodically thereafter. During the match, Danielson turned on his team by assaulting his rival Samoa Joe before leaving the match and effectively abandoning his involvement in the animosity between the two promotions. As the interpromotional hostility with CZW heightened, Danielson also defended against challengers from the rival company, who had signed an open contract for any CZW wrestler willing to challenge for the ROH World Championship. Former champion Samoa Joe also challenged Danielson at Fight of the Century on August 5, but their match ended in a 60-minute draw.\nWhile having the ROH World Championship, ROH faced the issue of having another title with seemingly equal value, the ROH Pure Championship. Danielson and the ROH Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness had a match to unify the titles. They met at April 29 in a match fought under pure wrestling rules and McGuinness left Danielson outside the ring after a chair shot to win by countout—this was enough to retain the Pure title, but not to win Danielson's World Championship. They had another unification match in McGuinness's native England; ROH decided that there had to be a winner, with a title changing hands by countout and disqualification and a draw forcing a restart. Danielson won the match on August 12 and retired the Pure title as its last champion (the title would later be reinstated the in 2020).. During a match with Colt Cabana on August 26, Danielson suffered a real injury when he separated his shoulder, tearing two tendons in it and he tore another tendon in his chest. Danielson returned at Glory by Honor V: Night 2 on September 16 and was challenged by Kenta, a guest competitor from NOAH, due to the two company's talent exchange agreement—Danielson again retained his championship. At Final Battle on December 23, Danielson's fifteen-month title reign finally ended after he lost to Homicide at his 39th defense and he subsequently took time off from wrestling in order to heal his shoulder.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, Danielson returned to ROH at Reborn Again and defeated Shane Hagadorn and Adam Pearce in separate matches. On May 12, ROH filmed its first pay-per-view, Respect is Earned, which had Danielson team with ROH World Champion Takeshi Morishima against Nigel McGuinness and Kenta. Danielson's team won after Danielson made Kenta tap out to his signature submission hold, the \"Cattle Mutilation\". Danielson vied to contend for the ROH World Championship by defeating McGuinness at Domination on June 9, which appeared on the company's next pay per view named Driven which took place on June 23, but was aired on September 21. This allowed him, now as a fan favorite, to challenge Morishima for the title at Manhattan Mayhem II on August 25 in a losing effort in which he also suffered a legitimate detached retina. Following surgery, he fought Morishima again in a match at Man Up on September 15, but the referee stopped the match since Danielson was unable to respond to him. In a rematch at Rising Above on December 29, Morishima was disqualified. Morishima returned to the company at Final Battle on December 27, 2008 in a match billed as a \"Fight Without Honor\" in which both men were allowed weapons and which Danielson won. Danielson commented in March 2012 on how he felt validated at Final Battle 2008, because he and Morishima managed to get 2,500 people to see the show in New York City.\n\nAs part of ROH's agreement with Pro Wrestling Noah, the company held a show in Japan named Tokyo Summit on September 14, where Danielson wrestled GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion Yoshinobu Kanemaru and won the championship. Following his victory, NOAH allowed him to defend the title in Ring of Honor, with his first defense being at Glory By Honor VII on September 20, defeating Katsuhiko Nakajima. However, this was his only successful defense as he returned to Japan on October 13 to lose the title to Kenta. Following his loss, Danielson challenged McGuinness for the ROH World Championship at the next ROH pay-per-view Rising Above on November 22, in a losing effort. Ring of Honor made its national television debut with the program \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" and Danielson made his television debut in the main event of its third episode on February 28, 2009 by defeating Austin Aries.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Danielson signed with WWE after a farewell tour with ROH, during which he challenged Aries for the title again and lost. On September 26 at Glory by Honor VIII: The Final Countdown, he won his last match in the company against McGuinness, who was also having his final match with the company.\n\nAside from competing primarily in ROH, Danielson has also competed in a multitude of other independent promotions, both in the United States and abroad. In 2003, Danielson also toured the United Kingdom for British promotion, All Star Wrestling (ASW). While he was in the United Kingdom, Danielson won the World Heavy Middleweight Championship on May 6 in an eight-man one-night tournament in Croydon defeating James Mason. He spent the next six months in the United Kingdom, working for ASW, Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA), the World Association of Wrestling (WAW) and Premier Promotions. He returned several times over the next five years, working for various promotions. In February 2005 at New Dawn Rising, Danielson made his debut in ROH's sister promotion, Full Impact Pro (FIP), teaming up with Rocky Romero in a match against Austin Aries and Homicide. The next night at Dangerous Intentions, Danielson competed in a losing effort against CM Punk, which led to a brief feud between the two. Danielson's biggest success came in 2006 by winning the FIP Heavyweight Championship, holding the belt for eleven months before losing it to Roderick Strong. Danielson wrestled his last match for FIP in December 2006 at Florida Rumble, where he lost to Erick Stevens.\nDanielson also wrestled in the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) promotion. He made his debut in November 2003 at An Inch Longer Than Average in a losing effort to PWG Champion Frankie Kazarian. He continued to appear in PWG over the next couple of years, winning the PWG World Championship in 2007 and holding it for six months before taking an eleven-month hiatus from the company. He made his return to PWG at the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles tournament. In April 2009, at PWG: One Hundred, Danielson defeated Kenny Omega. The match was notable for its opening, which included Omega and Danielson performing variable tests of strength, including arm wrestling and a thumb war, before singing \"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt\" along with the crowd. In May, he made another appearance teaming with Paul London, referring to himself as \"American Dolphin\" in a parodied manner. On September 4 at Guerre Sans Frontières during his last night in PWG, Danielson defeated Chris Hero to win the PWG World Championship for the second time and immediately vacated it afterward.\n\nFollowing his return from his injury in 2007, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) published a video of Danielson stating his intent to challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, as the establishment that sanctioned the title at the time, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, was relinquishing the title back to the NWA. A tournament, titled Reclaiming the Glory, was held to determine the new champion with Danielson making his way to finals, scheduled to compete Brent Albright on September 1, but due to the eye injury he sustained at ROH's Manhattan Mayhem event, he withdrew from the tournament and instead acted as the referee of the match.\n\nIn 2009, Danielson's contract with Ring of Honor expired, which opened up Danielson to travel to other companies more freely while competing in his home promotion.\n\nIn 2009, Danielson also signed a short-term contract with German wrestling promotion Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw). Shortly after his debut, Danielson won the wXw World Heavyweight Championship against Bad Bones and held it over a month before losing it to Absolute Andy.\n\nAfter his departure from wXw, he made his debut with Philadelphia-based independent promotion CHIKARA to compete in their King of Trios tournament, which saw him team with Claudio Castagnoli and Dave Taylor in a contingency called Team Uppercut. In the same year, Danielson competed in Dragon Gate USA's second show, losing to Open the Dream Gate Champion Naruki Doi.\n\nDanielson re-signed with WWE in August 2009. He made his debut on January 4, 2010 in a dark match prior to \"Raw\", defeating Chavo Guerrero. He went to Florida to train with Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), the WWE developmental territory, to acclimate himself to his new work environment and work on his ring rust. He debuted at the FCW television tapings on January 14 and lost to Kaval. At the February 11 tapings, Danielson was renamed Daniel Bryan. He later indicated that he was given a list of ten possible ring names to use in WWE (including Buddy Peacock and Lloyd Bonaire) and Daniel Bryan was one of them while his real name was not on that list. His name was given by William Regal.\n\nBryan made his debut on the inaugural episode of \"NXT\" on February 23, losing by submission to then World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho and being attacked by his storyline mentor The Miz for disrespecting him earlier in the show. Over the next several weeks, Bryan failed to win a single match, but despite a record of 0–5 he was ranked first in the inaugural Pros' Poll on the March 30 episode of \"NXT\". After losing five more matches on \"NXT\", Bryan got his first victory on the May 10 episode of \"Raw\" by pinning Santino Marella in an eight-on-four handicap match. The following night on \"NXT\", he was eliminated from the show along with Michael Tarver as neither man had confidence in themselves to win the competition. Despite his elimination, he appeared on the following episodes of \"NXT\", being interviewed by Matt Striker and attacking both Michael Cole and The Miz.\n\nOn the May 31 episode of \"Raw,\" Bryan was granted a match against The Miz by guest host Ashton Kutcher, which he won and threw Miz into Cole at ringside after the match. On the June 7 episode of \"Raw\", the faction known as The Nexus (NXT rookies from season one) invaded the WWE ring, attacking John Cena and causing destruction around the ringside area. On June 11, Danielson was fired from WWE for being too violent, strangling ring announcer Justin Roberts with his own neck tie. Danielson noted that WWE apologized to him for his release, explaining that they \"had sponsors they had to deal with\". His release was put in a storyline, where the rest of the \"NXT\" rookies kicked him out of the group for showing remorse for his actions and declared that Bryan would never return to the WWE again.\n\nAfter being released, Danielson received several offers to sign with other wrestling companies, being contacted by TNA, albeit indirectly and some Japanese promotions. Two weeks after his departure from WWE, Danielson made his return to the independent circuit on June 26, defeating Eddie Kingston at the CHIKARA event We Must Eat Michigan's Brain in Taylor, Michigan. Rather than receiving streamers, the fans instead threw neck ties in light of the Justin Roberts incident in WWE. The following day at CHIKARA's Faded Scars and Lines, Danielson defeated Young Lions Cup holder Tim Donst in a non-title match. On July 3, Danielson returned to wXw, defeating Wade Fitzgerald and TJP in the round robin stage of the Ambition 1 tournament. The following day, he defeated TJP in a rematch and finally Johnny Moss in the finals of the tournament to win Ambition 1. On July 17, Danielson debuted in the International Wrestling Association (IWA), being booked to defeat Q.T. Marshall for the IWA Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. On July 23, Danielson debuted in the fledgling EVOLVE promotion, which was originally conceived to be built around Danielson as their top star before he signed to WWE. In the main event, Danielson defeated Bobby Fish. The following day, Danielson returned to Dragon Gate USA and submitted Shingo in the dark match main event of Return of the Dragon.<ref name=\"DGUSA7/24\"></ref> After the match, Danielson joined BxB Hulk, Masato Yoshino, Naruki Doi and PAC as the fifth member of the stable World-1. On July 30, Danielson returned to Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, competing in a match where he defeated Roderick Strong. On August 7, Danielson unsuccessfully challenged Adam Pearce for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the NWA Legends Fanfest.\n\nDespite returning to WWE on August 15, Danielson honored most of his independent bookings, making his first appearance on August 20 and defeating Jon Moxley at Heartland Wrestling Association's Road to Destiny. The following day, he was defeated by Drake Younger at Insanity Pro Wrestling's Ninth Anniversary Reign of the Insane. On August 22, Danielson defeated J Freddie at a Squared Circle Wrestling event. On September 10, he returned to the IWA using the name Daniel Bryan and lost the IWA Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship to Dennis Rivera. The following day, Danielson returned to EVOLVE by defeating Munenori Sawa in the main event. Later that same night, Danielson wrestled for New York Wrestling Connection in a tag team match, where he and Tony Nese defeated Dimitrios Papadon and Alex Reynolds. On September 25, Danielson returned to Dragon Gate USA and defeated YAMATO in the main event of the evening. The following day, Danielson defeated Jon Moxley. On October 1, Danielson wrestled the last of his independent matches by defeating Shelton Benjamin at a Northeast Wrestling event.\n\nDanielson returned to WWE as Daniel Bryan at SummerSlam, where he was revealed as the surprise seventh member of Team WWE for the seven-on-seven elimination tag team match against The Nexus, the other \"NXT\" season one competitors. At the event on August 15, Bryan was one of the two final members of Team WWE and managed to eliminate two members of The Nexus, but was eliminated by Wade Barrett after The Miz, whose place he took in Team WWE, attacked him. Despite this, Team WWE won the match. The following night, he was revealed as part of the Raw roster. Bryan feuded with The Miz, with both interfering in each other's matches and The Miz being aided by Alex Riley, his rookie from the second season of \"NXT\". At Night of Champions on September 19, Bryan defeated The Miz to win the United States Championship, his first championship in WWE.\nBryan then successfully defended the title two weeks later by defeating The Miz and John Morrison in a triple threat submissions count anywhere match at Hell in a Cell on October 3. On October 24, he went on to challenge then Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler to a champion vs. champion match at Bragging Rights as a special attraction SmackDown vs. Raw match, defeating Ziggler in a highly acclaimed match. On November 21, Bryan went on to successfully defend his title against Ted DiBiase at Survivor Series. Bryan returned to \"NXT\"'s season four as the Pro to Rookie Derrick Bateman.\n\nIn late 2010, The Bella Twins began competing for Bryan's affection, leading to them supporting him at ringside and competing in mixed tag team matches together. On the January 24, 2011 episode of \"Raw\", it was revealed that Bryan had been secretly dating Gail Kim, who began accompanying him to ringside. On the March 14 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan lost the United States Championship to Sheamus, ending his reign at 176 days. Bryan was originally scheduled to have his rematch against Sheamus for the United States Championship on the main card at WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, but the match was rescheduled as a dark lumberjack match that ended in a no contest when the lumberjacks fought among themselves to trigger the start of a battle royal, which he lost. Bryan lost his title rematch the next night on \"Raw\", after which he was saved from Sheamus by the debuting Sin Cara.\n\nOn April 26, Bryan was drafted to SmackDown as part of the 2011 supplemental draft. On the May 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan made his debut for the brand by losing to Sheamus. Cody Rhodes then started a feud with Bryan by attacking him after losing their match and placing a paper bag on his head. Bryan then aligned with Sin Cara to feud with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase. On June 28, Bryan returned to NXT to manage Derrick Bateman once again.\n\nOn July 17 at Money in the Bank, Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match which earned him a World Heavyweight Championship match at any point within the following year. On the July 22 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at the following year's WrestleMania. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of \"SmackDown\" after Henry challenged Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. As his friend, Big Show then urged a groggy Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On the November 25 episode of \"SmackDown\", Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry, but SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by not waiting for WrestleMania, but explained he felt strongly about exacting revenge on Henry and realized he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of his briefcase, Bryan won a fatal four-way match on the same episode of \"SmackDown\" to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of \"SmackDown\", Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain the title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.\n\nBryan cashed in his Money in the Bank contract on December 18 at against Big Show, who had just defeated Henry and subsequently received a DDT onto a steel chair, which allowed Bryan to secure a pinfall victory and become the World Heavyweight Champion, thus making him also the first ever wrestler from NXT to win a WWE world championship. In the following weeks, tension was teased between Bryan and Big Show, with Big Show unhappy about Bryan taking the World Heavyweight Championship from him and Bryan being displeased about Big Show's lack of appreciation for Bryan's help in matches against Henry. As World Heavyweight Champion, Bryan turned into a villain as he gradually showed signs of overconfidence and arrogance, with Bryan beginning to partake in excessive victory celebrations, even when he won his matches by disqualification or countout. Despite AJ's declaration of love for him, Bryan avoided saying that he loved her in return.\nIn January 2012, Bryan successfully defended his title three times: the first occasion against Big Show when Bryan goaded Mark Henry into attacking him and causing a disqualification; the second occasion a no disqualification rematch with Big Show which ended abruptly after Big Show accidentally ran into AJ, hospitalizing her within the storyline for which Bryan blamed him; and the third occasion against Henry in a lumberjack match when Bryan provoked the lumberjacks to interfere and cause a no contest. This culminated in a triple threat steel cage match to exclude outside interference at the Royal Rumble on January 29, where Bryan escaped the cage after freeing himself from Big Show's grasp to retain the championship.\n\nAt Elimination Chamber on February 19, Bryan defeated Big Show, Cody Rhodes, The Great Khali, Santino Marella and Wade Barrett in an Elimination Chamber match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Royal Rumble match winner Sheamus attacked Bryan and chose him as his WrestleMania opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. In March, Bryan began to mistreat AJ, publicly demanding her to shut up and claiming that she always got in his way. Despite these actions, AJ continued to stand by Bryan. Bryan's reign as world champion ended at 105 days when Sheamus defeated him in 18 seconds at WrestleMania XXVIII due to Bryan being distracted with receiving a good luck kiss from AJ. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan blamed AJ for his world title loss and ended their relationship. Despite AJ's attempts to mend their relationship, Bryan cruelly rebuffed her multiple times, leaving AJ an emotional wreck. At Extreme Rules on April 29, Bryan failed to regain the World Heavyweight Championship from Sheamus in a two-out-of-three falls match, losing two falls to one.\n\nThe next night on \"Raw\", Bryan became the number one contender to CM Punk's WWE Championship when he won a Beat the Clock challenge by defeating Jerry Lawler in under three minutes. Bryan received his title shot at Over the Limit on May 20 and suffered a controversial loss—when Bryan rolled back onto his shoulders as he applied the \"Yes!\" Lock, Punk tapped out immediately after the referee counted a pinfall win for Punk. Shortly before Over the Limit, Bryan interfered in a match between Punk and Kane to frame Punk attacking Kane with a steel chair, leading to a three-way feud. During this time, a jilted AJ turned her affections to both Punk and Kane. On the June 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan's interference caused WWE Championship match between Punk and Kane to end in a double disqualification, resulting in a triple threat match being set up on June 17 at No Way Out, where Punk managed to retain the title after AJ distracted Kane. On the June 25 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan defeated Punk and Kane in a non-title three-way elimination match to earn another shot at the WWE Championship. At Money in the Bank on July 15, Bryan failed to capture the WWE Championship again from Punk in a no disqualification match with AJ as special guest referee. The following night on \"Raw\", AJ accepted Bryan's marriage proposal, On \"Raw 1000\", Bryan's storyline wedding ended in failure when AJ left Bryan at the altar and instead accepted Mr. McMahon's offer of the position of permanent Raw General Manager. Bryan's night turned from bad to worse as he was later attacked by The Rock and insulted by celebrity Charlie Sheen.\nAJ's rejection of Bryan turned him into an angry and bitter individual and resulted in Bryan lashing out at audiences. AJ continued to exact her revenge on Bryan by denying him a WWE Championship shot and instead forcing him to face Kane on August 19 at SummerSlam, where Bryan emerged victorious. As a result of Bryan and Kane's issues, AJ enrolled them in anger management classes hosted by Dr. Shelby and they were later forced to \"hug it out\". At the arrangement of Dr. Shelby and AJ, the two adversaries formed a team whose constant bickering and infighting even during matches inadvertently resulted in them defeating The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) to become the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the September 10 episode of \"Raw\" and then defeating champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth to win the championship on September 16 at Night of Champions.\n\nBryan and Kane made their first successful title defense the following night on \"Raw\", defeating the former champions in a rematch. The following week on \"Raw\", \"Team Hell No\" was chosen as the official team name via a Twitter poll while Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow) started a feud with Bryan and Kane, turning Bryan into a fan favorite once again. On October 28 at Hell in a Cell, Team Hell No lost to the Rhodes Scholars via disqualification, but retained their title. This was followed by a rematch on the November 14 \"Main Event\", where Team Hell No defeated the Rhodes Scholars to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the November 26 episode of \"Raw\", after Kane lost to WWE Champion CM Punk in a non-title match, he was assaulted by The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins) and Bryan and Ryback, who both attempted to save Kane, suffered a similar fate. This attack had the effect of uniting Bryan and Kane and after The Shield and Team Hell No, along with Ryback, attacked each other on the December 3 episode of \"Raw\", all six men were decreed to face each other in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match on December 16 at , where The Shield was victorious after pinning Bryan. Team Hell No went on to defend the tag team titles through the end of the year, retaining against Team Rhodes Scholars on the following \"Main Event\" and against 3MB (Drew McIntyre and Heath Slater) on the December 31 episode of \"Raw\". Bryan ended 2012 having wrestled the second most televised and pay-per-view matches that year with 90.\n\nOn January 27 at the 2013 Royal Rumble, Team Hell No retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against Team Rhodes Scholars. During the Royal Rumble match, Bryan eliminated Kane and was in turn thrown out of the ring by Antonio Cesaro—Kane caught Bryan before he touched the floor and despite Bryan's begging dropped him to complete his elimination. On the February 4 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan was inserted into the World Heavyweight Championship number one contender Elimination Chamber match when he defeated Rey Mysterio, after which the returning Mark Henry attacked both men. On February 17 at Elimination Chamber, Bryan was the first man eliminated from the match, courtesy of Henry. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Team Hell No defeated Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston for another successful title defense. Team Hell No rekindled their rivalry with The Shield the following night on \"Raw\" after saving The Undertaker from an ambush by them. On the April 22 episode of \"Raw\", Team Hell No and The Undertaker were defeated by The Shield in a six-man tag team match. The Shield went on to take out Undertaker and rack up wins over Bryan and Kane in both singles and tag matches that also included WWE Champion John Cena. On May 19 at Extreme Rules, Bryan and Kane lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Shield members Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, ending their reign at 245 days.\n\nAs he being pinned led to the loss of the tag team titles, Bryan became obsessed about proving that he was not the weak link of Team Hell No and as a result became even more aggressive, but his overzealous behavior led to Team Hell No losing their rematch against Rollins and Reigns on the May 27 episode of \"Raw\". When Kane tried to reassure Bryan, he replied with harsh rebukes that alienated Kane from him and as a result Bryan was paired with Randy Orton despite their poor relationship to face a common enemy in The Shield. During this storyline, Bryan was praised as the best performer in WWE and having an unmatched connection with crowds by critics, peers and veterans of the professional wrestling industry.\n\nOn the June 14 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan (with Kane and Orton as his tag team partners) ended The Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in a televised six-man tag match by forcing Rollins to submit. On June 16 at Payback, Bryan and Orton's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Rollins and Reigns' WWE Tag Team Championship. The following night on \"Raw\", while the status of Team Hell No was left up in the air after both members considered individual pursuits, Bryan and Orton faced off in a no disqualification match that Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legit nerve injury, which was a stinger resulting in Bryan being unable to feel both his arms for the rest of the match. On the June 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan defeated Orton, but to Bryan's dismay it was via countout. On the following \"Raw\", Bryan decisively defeated Orton via submission in a street fight and later continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Bryan competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, during which Bryan was attacked by Curtis Axel, a non-participant, which ultimately prevented him from winning the match that was won by Orton.\n\nOn the July 15 episode of \"Raw\", WWE Champion John Cena picked Bryan to be his opponent for the WWE title match at SummerSlam. This led to Bryan being embroiled (in storyline) in the McMahon family's internal feud, with WWE chairman Vince McMahon against Bryan due to Bryan's image not fitting of McMahon's vision of a typical WWE wrestler, while WWE chief operating officer Triple H was in support of Bryan. On the July 22 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan ran a gauntlet match to prove his worth as number one contender, defeating Jack Swagger and Antonio Cesaro in succession while his third opponent Ryback was disqualified after performing a powerbomb on Bryan through a table. The following week on \"Raw\", Bryan was forced to face Kane and emerged victorious, but Kane attacked him after the match. On August 18 at SummerSlam, Bryan defeated Cena to win his first WWE Championship, but after the match special referee Triple H performed his Pedigree finishing move on Bryan, leading to Randy Orton cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to win the title from Bryan.\n\nThe next night on \"Raw\", Triple H and the McMahons endorsed Orton as \"the face of the WWE\" while labeling Bryan a \"B+ player\" and forming The Authority faction, claiming that the company was looking for Orton as champion instead of Bryan, who also assumed the top babyface role (heroic character) in WWE with Cena being out injured. With Triple H threatening to fire anyone who disobeyed him, Bryan was left alone to take on and suffer attacks from Orton and The Shield. On September 15 at Night of Champions, Bryan defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship, but he was stripped of the title the following night on \"Raw\" by Triple H after referee Scott Armstrong said he had made a fast count the previous night resulting in Bryan's win while Bryan denied that Armstrong was working for him. Armstrong was then kayfabe fired by The Authority while Bryan and Orton faced off again for the vacant title on October 6 at Battleground in a match that ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and knocked out both men. Bryan once again challenged Orton for the vacant championship on October 27 at Hell in a Cell, but was unsuccessful after the special guest referee Shawn Michaels hit Bryan with a superkick for attacking his best friend Triple H. The following night on \"Raw\", Bryan confronted Michaels, who offered a handshake, but Bryan put Michaels in the \"Yes!\" Lock.\n\nLater that same night, Bryan was attacked by The Wyatt Family. Bryan then found an ally in former rival CM Punk, as the duo defeated Luke Harper and Erick Rowan of The Wyatt Family on November 24 at Survivor Series, However, the entire Wyatt Family defeated Bryan in a handicap match on December 15 at , with Wyatt attempting to recruit Bryan in the previous weeks. On the final \"Raw\" of 2013, Bryan defeated Harper and then Rowan in a gauntlet match so that he could face Wyatt, whereupon Harper and Rowan interfered for a disqualification and beat him down. Bryan then acknowledged that no matter how many times the fans chanted \"Yes!\" or supported him, it was not enough for \"the machine\", so he gave up and decided to join The Wyatt Family. On the January 13 episode of \"Raw\", after Wyatt and Bryan lost to The Usos in a tag team steel cage match, Wyatt was attempting to \"punish\" Bryan for their lack of success since he joined the group, but Bryan attacked him and the rest of The Wyatt Family. Afterwards Bryan discarded the blue overalls he had been wearing as a member of The Wyatt Family, scaled the cage and led the live audience in a \"Yes!\" chant. At the 2014 Royal Rumble on January 26, despite Bryan losing to Wyatt in a singles match and later not participating in the Royal Rumble match, the audience continued to chant for Bryan during the Royal Rumble match and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Cena and Orton.\nOn the January 27 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan qualified for the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at the eponymous pay-per-view by teaming up with John Cena and Sheamus to defeat The Shield via disqualification. Meanwhile, he also continued his feud with The Authority as Kane attacked him on multiple occasions, attempting to injure Bryan before his Elimination Chamber match on February 23, in which Bryan survived until he was one of the final two participants, but defending champion Randy Orton retained after Kane interfered in the match by attacking Bryan.\n\nOn the March 10 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan and multiple fans occupied the ring (while WWE road crew members dressed in Bryan T-shirts posed as fans outside the ring) and refused to leave, resulting in an irate Triple H agreeing to Bryan's demand for a match at WrestleMania XXX, with the stipulation that the winner would be inserted into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at the event. At the event on April 6, Bryan defeated Triple H and was inserted into the title match, but Triple H attacked Bryan after their match. Despite a storyline injury and interference from The Authority and a crooked referee, Bryan prevailed over Batista and champion Randy Orton in the WrestleMania main event to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" editor Wade Keller analyzed (and Danielson later confirmed in his memoir) that Bryan's WrestleMania journey was due to several factors: the fans' rejection of Batista and continual support of Bryan over the previous six months (even when he joined The Wyatt Family) as well as CM Punk legitimately walking out on WWE after the Royal Rumble. Both Bryan and Chris Jericho later said that Bryan's original WrestleMania XXX opponent was supposed to be Sheamus.\n\nThe \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\" wrote: \"Leading into WrestleMania 30, the Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H program was the top draw of \"Raw\" each week. Coming out of WM30, Bryan as new WWE World Hvt. champion has been solidified as a ratings draw\". This trend continued until at least May 2014, when Bryan had to undergo neck surgery due his first of the two major injuries that would eventually force him to retire in February 2016.\n\nOn the \"Raw\" following WrestleMania XXX, Triple H used his authority to grant himself a title match against Bryan, who was then attacked by Orton, Batista and Kane just before the match which ended in a no contest and Bryan's retention when The Shield interfered to chase away Bryan's adversaries. Stephanie McMahon enticed Kane to return to his masked self which Kane complied and was granted a future title match against Bryan and proceeded to carry out a brutal attack against Bryan which led to a scripted injury to give him time off to mourn his recently deceased father. At Extreme Rules on May 4, Bryan defeated Kane in an Extreme Rules match to retain his title.\n\nAt some point in time, Bryan lost all strength in his right arm and required neck surgery. On the May 12 episode of \"Raw\", he was attacked by Kane and stretchered away that same night to justify his absence. On May 15, Bryan underwent successful neck surgery, with a cervical foraminotomy to decompress the nerve root having been performed. Two weeks later on \"Raw\", when Bryan refused to relinquish his title Stephanie McMahon threatened to fire Bryan's wife Brie Bella, if Bryan did not give up his title on June 1 at Payback. The ultimatum resulted in Bella \"quitting\" WWE so that Bryan did not have to give up his title. However, when it was revealed that Bryan would not be able to compete at Money in the Bank and defend his title, The Authority stripped him of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on the June 9 episode of \"Raw\", ending Bryan's third reign at 64 days. Due to his injury, Bryan was largely off WWE TV during this period. Months after the neck surgery, Bryan's strength still had not returned to his arm. Many doctors felt a second surgery was needed, while others told Bryan he would not be able to return to wrestling. Bryan contemplated further elbow surgery, but instead went to Denver to undergo the Muscle Activation Techniques program, which successfully returned the strength to his right arm. To prepare for his in-ring return, he trained in kickboxing and jujitsu.\n\nOn the November 24 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan returned to WWE, taunting the recently deposed Authority. As guest general manager for that episode of \"Raw\" and the November 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan arranged punishments for those allied with The Authority. Apart from scheduling a chairs match between Kane and Ryback for on December 14, Bryan also affirmed that he would return soon.\n\nBryan told WWE management that he wished to be the \"face of \"SmackDown\"\" to increase the show's viewership. Bryan returned to the ring on the January 15, 2015 episode of \"SmackDown\", with his opponent Kane being disqualified due to The Authority's interference and later that night Bryan won the six-man tag team main event. The next week on \"SmackDown\", despite more interference by The Authority, Bryan defeated Kane in a no disqualification main event to keep his Royal Rumble match spot.\n\nBryan entered the 2015 Royal Rumble match at number 10, managing one elimination before being eliminated by Bray Wyatt in the first half of the match, causing the Philadelphia crowd to repeatedly chant for him during the second half of the match while booing other wrestlers entering the match, including eventual winner and fellow \"good guy\" Roman Reigns.\n\nOn the January 29 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan ended his feud with Kane by defeating him in a casket match. On the February 2 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan defeated Seth Rollins, earning the right to face Roman Reigns at Fastlane, as the winner of the Fastlane match would challenge Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 31 for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At Fastlane on February 22, Bryan lost to Reigns, failing to make his entry to WrestleMania main event.\n\nAfter Fastlane, Bryan set his sights on the Intercontinental Championship for WrestleMania 31, where he was one of multiple wrestlers who came to possess champion Bad News Barrett's title belt while defeating Barrett in non-title matches. On the March 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan declared his entry into the multi-man ladder match for the Intercontinental title at WrestleMania 31. After Bryan was pinned twice within a week by fellow ladder match entrant Dolph Ziggler, the \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\" reported that \"WWE has made it clear where Bryan stands after starting to lose regularly now\". WWE's storylines for Bryan since his return were widely criticized. Dave Scherer of \"Pro Wrestling Insider\" questioned \"bringing Bryan back for the Rumble in the first place\" if there was no intention of letting Bryan win. Benjamin Tucker of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" criticized WWE for having \"watered down\" Bryan's heroic character to a \"sneaky, backstabbing, cheap, aggravating jerk\" for the feud against Roman Reigns. Mike Tedesco of \"WrestleView\" wrote in March that WWE \"killed Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton dead in the last two months. It takes a special bunch of nincompoops to pull that off\". Jake Barnett of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" said that Bryan being labeled a \"turd\" was \"asking fans to disbelieve what they see with their own eyes\" and \"will do nothing to calm down the conspiracy theorists who insist WWE is intentionally cooling off Bryan to make Reigns look better in comparison\". In a piece for the \"Wrestling Observer\", Zach Dominello was \"dumbfounded and disheartened\" that \"after returning from a very serious injury, WWE's bright idea is to put Bryan in one of the most dangerous matches possible at WrestleMania\", while having \"dragged Bryan down to the levels of R-Truth and Stardust\".\nBryan won the Intercontinental Championship ladder match at WrestleMania 31 on March 29. This made him one of six wrestlers at the time to achieve WWE's new Grand Slam due to winning every active title in WWE (except for female-exclusive titles), while also making him WWE's 26th Triple Crown Champion having won the WWE, World Heavyweight, Tag Team, United States and Intercontinental Championships. The next night on \"Raw\", Bryan defeated Dolph Ziggler in his first successful title defense, before they were attacked by Barrett only for Sheamus to return and chase off Barrett before attacking Bryan and Ziggler. Bryan lost to Sheamus on the April 2 \"SmackDown\" by countout when Barrett interfered. During the match, Bryan split his forehead open on the broadcast table, causing him to bleed and later requiring stitches for the wound. On the April 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", in his last in-ring match for nearly three years, Bryan teamed up with United States Champion John Cena to defeat WWE Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Tyson Kidd by submission.\nFollowing the April 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", WWE pulled Bryan from wrestling on the remainder of WWE's touring of Europe as a \"precautionary measure\". Bryan's scheduled title defense at Extreme Rules on April 26 against Bad News Barrett was later canceled as Bryan was \"medically unable to compete\". Less than a week later, WWE stopped advertising Bryan from all future live events or television tapings. After about a month off television, Bryan returned on the May 11 episode of \"Raw\" to explain that after having undergone an MRI he would be out for an unknown period of time and could possibly have to retire (though the nature of his injuries were not revealed), therefore he relinquished the Intercontinental Championship. On the Elimination Chamber pre-show on May 31, Bryan stated that he would eventually wrestle again. In July, Bryan revealed that his injury was concussion-related and claimed that he had been cleared to return to the ring by external medical professionals and was waiting for WWE to clear him. During his time away, he trimmed his signature beard and cut his hair short, donating his hair to Wigs 4 Kids, a charity similar to that of Locks of Love.\n\nOn February 8, 2016, Bryan retired due to medical reasons. Later on that day's episode of \"Raw\", broadcast from Bryan's home state of Washington, Bryan gave a retirement speech expressing his gratefulness for the happiness wrestling had brought him. The following day on ESPN, Bryan revealed that he suffered ten documented concussions while wrestling, but more might have been undocumented or misdiagnosed. He said a recent EEG reflex test revealed slowing and a small subacute or chronic lesion in his brain's temporoparietal region, which explained Bryan's post-concussion seizures and led to his retirement decision. Bryan had been cleared by a doctor for the Arizona Cardinals and passed a concussion test at UCLA with \"flying colors\", but WWE's head of medical Joseph Maroon refused to clear him. Journalist Dave Meltzer suggested that this may have been because of Maroon having been portrayed in a negative light in the film \"Concussion\". Initially, Bryan requested his release from WWE and was looking to return to NJPW and ROH as well as work in Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), but the request was turned down by Vince McMahon. Bryan underwent a new test, where the lesion in his brain was discovered, after which he himself made the decision to retire. On \"Thank You Daniel\", a WWE Network tribute to Bryan, he confirmed that he had been asked about working for WWE in a different capacity while comparing this to \"a partner breaking up with you, getting married to someone else and then asking you to be best friends\", expanding to say that he needed time to heal emotionally before he could agree to such an offer. During this period, WWE confirmed that Bryan would continue to appear for the company in a non in-ring role alongside his wife Brie Bella, who served as a WWE Ambassador following her retirement from in-ring competition on April 3 at WrestleMania 32. Recognized as a WWE Legend, Bryan co-hosted the WWE Network tournament Cruiserweight Classic alongside SmackDown commentator Mauro Ranallo in mid-2016.\n\nWith the inception of WWE's second brand split, Bryan was appointed by SmackDown General Manager on the July 18 episode of \"Raw\". Along with SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon, Bryan played a vital role in the WWE draft. After SummerSlam on August 21, Bryan unveiled two new championships exclusive to the SmackDown brand: the SmackDown Women's Championship and the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. As part of his General Manager duties, Bryan co-hosted \"Talking Smack\" with Renee Young, a post-show interview segment on the WWE Network. The segment frequently became the site for heated altercations between Bryan and The Miz; Bryan openly expressed his disdain while Miz complained about being mistreated. The two continued to feud for the rest of the year, with Miz often running away from Bryan when a physical altercation was teased. These altercations were intertwined with Miz feuding over the Intercontinental championship with Dolph Ziggler. Following another verbal clash on \"Miz TV\" at the November 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan decided to trade Miz to Raw if he failed to regain the championship from Ziggler. Miz defeated Ziggler on the 900th episode of \"SmackDown Live\" on November 15 to become a six-time Intercontinental Champion.\n\nOn the October 11 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan and Shane challenged the Raw brand to three 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team matches at the event of the same name as a means to determine which brand was superior. On the October 17 episode of \"Raw\", Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon and Raw General Manager Mick Foley accepted Bryan's challenge.\n\nOn the April 10 and 11, 2017 episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", Bryan was involved in the 2017 Superstar Shake-up in which brand's former champions Alexa Bliss, Bray Wyatt, Dean Ambrose, The Miz, Heath Slater and Rhyno were traded to Raw. Bryan later took time off from WWE television for paternity leave and returned on the June 20 episode, during which he stripped Carmella of her Money In The Bank briefcase and suspended James Ellsworth due to his interference in the match. On the August 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan appointed Shane McMahon as a guest referee for United States Champion AJ Styles's title defense against Kevin Owens at SummerSlam, thereby triggering a long-term feud between Owens and Shane that would ultimately also involve Bryan himself.\n\nBryan was again absent from television after being attacked by Kane on the October 30 episode of \"Raw\". He returned on the November 14 episode of \"SmackDown\".\n\nAfter Survivor Series Bryan became deeply involved in Shane McMahon's feud against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, favoring the latter two. On the November 21 episode of Smackdown Shane was about to fire the two for attacking him during their Survivor Series interbrand elimination match against Team Raw, which SmackDown ultimately lost. To settle the dispute whether Owens and Zayn should be fired, the two were scheduled to wrestle Randy Orton and Shinsuke Nakamura at Clash of Champions with Owens's and Zayn's jobs on the line. During the match Shane and Bryan acted as guest referees and come to blows: after Shane intentionally stopped a count at two during a pinfall attempt by Zayn, while Bryan made a fast count to give Owens and Zayn the win. Over the following weeks, Bryan kept on favoring Owens and Zayn by giving them multiple opportunities at AJ Styles's WWE Championship, first in a handicap title match at the Royal Rumble and then by including Owens and Zayn among the five challengers at Fastlane. During the latter match, Shane broke up pinfall attempts by Owens and Zayn, resulting in a brutal attack by Owens and Zayn on the following SmackDown.\n\nAt that time, after more than two years of evaluations, reviews of his medical history and neurological and physical evaluations, Bryan was cleared by three external independent neurosurgeons, neurologists and concussion experts — in addition to Joseph Maroon — to return to WWE in-ring competition on March 20. On that day's \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan thanked fans for their constant support and vowed to wrestle again. In his role as General Manager, he (kayfabe) fired Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn for attacking Shane McMahon the week before, resulting in Owens and Zayn attacking Bryan. In response, Bryan expressed regret over favoring them and scheduled a tag team match at WrestleMania 34 pitting himself and Shane against Owens and Zayn, with the latter being rehired if they win. At the event on April 8, Bryan and McMahon won after Bryan made Zayn submit in his first match since April 2015. As a result of being medically cleared, Bryan resigned as general manager.\n\nBryan participated in the Greatest Royal Rumble match at the namesake event as the first entrant, lasting for 76 minutes—the record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match—before being eliminated by Big Cass in the final three. Bryan defeated Big Cass at Backlash on May 6 and Money in the Bank on June 17. On the June 26 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan was aided by Kane in a post-match attack from The Bludgeon Brothers, thus reuniting Team Hell No. At Extreme Rules, Team Hell No lost to The Bludgeon Brothers, after Kane was attacked pre-match with Bryan having to compete in a handicap match.\n\nAfter months of goading and later avoiding Bryan—as well as getting involved in Team Hell No's feud with The Bludgeon Brothers—Bryan competed against long-time rival The Miz at SummerSlam, but lost due to an undetected use of brass knuckles. Following SummerSlam, Miz mocked Bryan by delivering a fake retirement speech and Bryan's wife Brie Bella returned as his partner. At Hell in a Cell on September 16, Bryan and Bella lost to Miz and Maryse after Maryse pinned Bella. At Super Show-Down on October 6, Bryan defeated Miz to earn a WWE Championship opportunity against AJ Styles at Crown Jewel on November 2. However, in wake of the Khashoggi death incident he refused to work the Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia and the storyline was altered so that their match took place on the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", which Bryan lost. On the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan was named team captain of SmackDown at Survivor Series on November 18, but later had to share this role with The Miz.\nOn the November 13 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan defeated AJ Styles to win the WWE Championship for the fourth time following a low blow. After the match, he attacked Styles, turning heel in the process for the first time since October 2012. As a result of his title win, Bryan was removed from Team SmackDown at Survivor Series with Jeff Hardy, taking his place on the team and he faced Universal Champion Brock Lesnar in an interbrand champion vs. champion match, which he lost. Two days later on \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan explained his actions, stating that he was following his dreams and that the fans were not with him during his recovery to return to the ring. He then christened himself as \"The New\" Daniel Bryan, and a rematch between Bryan and Styles for the title was scheduled for , where he successfully defended the title. At the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, Bryan successfully retained his title against Styles once again, this time following interference from the returning Rowan. On the January 29 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan threw the standard title belt in a garbage can (bemoaning the fact it was made from leather) and introduced a new belt, made from \"entirely sustainable materials\". Bryan was scheduled to defend his championship in an Elimination Chamber match. On the February 12 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", the contestants competed in a gauntlet match to determine who would enter the match last, Bryan was eliminated by Kofi Kingston. At Elimination Chamber, Bryan successfully retained the title, last eliminating Kingston. At Fastlane, Bryan was originally scheduled to defend his championship against Kingston, but after Mr. McMahon replaced Kingston; Bryan successfully retained the title in a triple-threat match against Kevin Owens and Mustafa Ali. After winning two back-to-back gauntlet matches, Kingston was finally granted the title match at WrestleMania 35. At the event on April 7, Bryan lost the title to Kingston, ending his reign at 145 days. After WrestleMania, Bryan was briefly sidelined by an undisclosed injury, but was cleared to return to action on April 30. On May 6, Bryan competed on his first match on \"Raw\" since March 2015, where he lost to Kingston in a WrestleMania rematch, ending their feud.\n\nOn the May 7 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan and Rowan defeated The Usos for the vacant SmackDown Tag Team Championship, marking their first reign as a team. At Money in the Bank, Bryan and Rowan faced off against The Usos in a non title match in a losing effort. At Stomping Grounds, Bryan and Rowan defeated Heavy Machinery (Otis and Tucker) to retain the titles. On July 14 at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, Bryan and Rowan lost the titles to The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) in a triple threat tag-team match, which also involved Heavy Machinery.\n\nIn August, Bryan and Rowan became involved in a storyline with Roman Reigns, as Reigns was being targeted for attacks by a mystery conspirator. Reigns suspected Rowan as his attacker due to seemingly incriminating video footage, but Bryan instead revealed that the attacker was merely a man who resembled Rowan. However, Rowan later turned on Bryan and revealed that he was the attacker the entire time, ending the alliance between the two. On the September 24 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Bryan was saved by Reigns from an assault from Rowan and Luke Harper. Bryan then joined with Reigns to take down Rowan and Harper, thus turning face in the process. At Hell in a Cell, Bryan teamed with Reigns to defeat Rowan and Harper.\n\nOn the November 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan was attacked by Universal Champion \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. In response, Bryan challenged Wyatt for the Universal Championship at Survivor Series, which Bryan lost. On the following \"SmackDown\", after Wyatt challenged Bryan to another match, Bryan accepted the challenge and said that the Yes Movement is back. During the Yes chants, Wyatt appeared as The Fiend and attacked Bryan, ripping out his hair and beard. Bryan, sporting a clean shave and hair cut short, returned at to attack Wyatt. On the December 20 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan defeated The Miz and King Corbin in a triple threat match to earn another Universal Championship match at the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2020, but Bryan was again unsuccessful at the event. \n\nAfter the Royal Rumble, Bryan began a rivalry with Drew Gulak, who claimed to have \"found holes in Bryan's game\". This led to a match being made for the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on March 8, which Bryan won. On the March 13 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan formed an alliance with Gulak, as Gulak managed Bryan during his match against Cesaro, where both were subsequently attacked by Cesaro, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Intercontinental Champion Sami Zayn. On the March 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Gulak defeated Nakamura, Bryan earned an Intercontinental Championship match against Zayn at WrestleMania 36 which he lost. On the May 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", Daniel Bryan defeated Drew Gulak in the quarter finals of a tournament for the vacant Intercontinental Championship.\n\nDanielson has spent the majority of his career without an overt character in favor of becoming popular with the fans through his monikers, signature mannerisms and wrestling ability, while his attire has varied as well, with the majority of his tenure wearing a pair of [[Tights#Athletic use|short trunks],], but also ventured into wearing a mask for a time in Japan as an extension of his American Dragon persona.\n\nA notable part of Danielson's persona is his mannerisms and the reaction he inspires from the crowd during the course of his matches that include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanielson was prominently featured in the \"Wrestling Road Diaries\" documentary, which was filmed in 2009 before he signed with WWE.

Led by Cardinal Jesus Hate and JJ Bedsore (AKA Colin Smith and Jamie Cantwell), the band formed in the early 1980s under the name \"Coming Blood\". Their music is a blend of hardcore punk, Oi!, heavy metal, football chants and shock rock.\n\nMany of their songs criticize religion or discuss political or philosophical topics. \n\nTheir first single, \"Megalomania\", ridiculed the Pope. Doctor Wild Thing played drums on 'Megalomania'. Their second single release \"Stark Raving Normal\" (a double A side with Mesrine) criticized one-dimensional patriotism, apathy and mediocrity. The Cardinal calls himself a punk secular humanist. Their first album, \"False Gestures for a Devious Public featuring Evo (ex Angelic Upstarts,Warfare & Major Accident)on drums\" (1983), hit the UK top 30 and was voted one of the year’s best releases by Sounds magazine. They used to be managed by Garry Bushell, and their song \"Such Fun\" was on the Oi! compilation album \"Oi! Oi! That's Yer Lot!.\" 'False Gestures For A Devious Public' 1983 also included the song 'Mesrine' which was an anthem about the French iconoclastic gangster Jacques Mesrine. 'Mesrine' by The Blood was released in 1983 which preceded the release of the film of the same name that was made in 1984. J.J. Bedsore died in 2004 of multiple organ failure due to years of chronic alcoholism.\n\nOn 10 December 2006, (International Human Rights Day) The Blood was reformed by the Cardinal and some of his friends to release the song, \"Kill The Pimps\", on the Eyeline Productions record label. The song criticizes governments that turn a blind eye to human trafficking. On 11 September 2007, The Blood released their first acoustic DVD, \"Samurai Lullaby\", on the Eyeline Productions record label. The film footage on this DVD is taken from the tragedy of 9/11. On 1 June 2008, The Blood released an acoustic CD album \"punk@theopera\". The concept album reveals the voyage of two young people who struggle to free themselves from human-trafficking pimps and a tyrannical religious cult. In 2010, The Blood's latest work came out, a self-penned album, by The Cardinal, \"@thebodysnatchersball\".\n\nOn 8 June 2012, The Blood is reformed by The Cardinal, Chema Zurita a.k.a.

The nephew of fellow wrestler Hulk Hogan, he is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling in the late 1990s under the ring name Horace Hogan.\n\nBollea was trained by Boris Malenko, debuting on the Floridian independent circuit in January 1990 under the ring name \"Horace Boulder\". Bollea competed for promotions such as the International Championship Wrestling Alliance.\n\nIn May 1991, Bollea joined the Japanese promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling. In mid-1991, Bollea formed a dominant tag team with a fellow gaijin wrestler, The Gladiator. The duo engaged in a long-running feud with Atsushi Onita and Sambo Asako.\n\nIn April 1992, Bollea began tagging with Sabu. On May 7, 1992 in Tokyo, Bollea and Sabu defeated Onita and Tarzan Goto for the WWA World Martial Arts Tag Team Championship. They held the championship until May 24, 1992, when they were defeated by Goto and Gregory Veritchev in Tokyo. In the same month, Bollea teamed with Negro Casas and Tim Patterson in a six-man tag team bout against Onita, Goto and El Hijo del Santo that received a rare \"five star\" ranking from the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\". Bollea continued to compete with FMW until December 1992.\n\nIn January 1993, Bollea joined the World Wrestling Federation as \"The Predator\". He made his televised debut on the January 31, 1993 episode of \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\" losing to El Matador. This was his sole televised match in the WWF, as he competed exclusively at house shows for the remainder of his tenure. He was used primarily as a jobber, losing to wrestlers such as Jim Brunzell, Jim Powers, and Marty Jannetty. Bollea made his final appearance with the WWF in August 1993.\n\nIn April 1993, Bollea toured Japan with New Japan Pro Wrestling, wrestling as \"Axe Boulder\".\n\nIn early 1995, Bollea briefly performed with Extreme Championship Wrestling under the ring name \"Prey of the Dead\".\n\nIn mid-1995, Bollea returned to FMW. He joined the stable \"Lethal Weapon\" with Hisakatsu Oya, The Gladiator, Mr. Pogo, and Ricky Fuji. He and Oya began teaming together, and won the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship from Daisuke Ikeda and Yoshiaki Fujiwara on December 21, 1995 in Yokohama. Their reign lasted until January 5, 1996, when Jason the Terrible and Super Leather defeated them in Tokyo.\n\nReturning to America, Bollea debuted in World Championship Wrestling. On the February 23, 1997 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\", Bollea, as Horace Boulder, defeated J.L. (Jerry Lynn). At Spring Stampede 1998 on April 19, 1998, Boulder officially debuted helping Raven defeat Diamond Dallas Page for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and joining Raven's Flock in the process, under the name \"Horace Boulder\". He remained in the Flock until the stable disbanded on September 13, 1998.\n\nThe fall of 1998 would hold one of the most crucial moments in Horace's wrestling career. Hollywood Hogan, backed by fellow New World Order (nWo) Hollywood members, revealed on the October 19, 1998 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" that Horace was the son of his dead brother. Showing a sincerity not seen in previous years, he continued by proclaiming his love to his family and offering Horace a membership in the nWo. The mood quickly took a turn for the worse, however, when Hollywood Hogan bashed his nephew with a steel chair, causing a wound that would require several stitches. He continued by throwing his nephew off a stretcher and mercilessly beating him. During this time, Hogan was involved in a heated rivalry with The Ultimate Warrior, and this scene worked as a testament to Hulk's fragile state of mind. With fellow nWo members standing in bewilderment, Hogan took the mic and said \"If I could do this to someone I love, imagine what I'm gonna do to you, Warrior!\"\n\nDespite their unsettling confrontation, Horace joined the nWo (not the babyface Wolfpac led by Kevin Nash, but the Hollywood version led by his uncle) at Halloween Havoc 1998 on October 25, 1998, by interfering on his uncle's behalf during the final match between Hollywood Hogan and The Warrior. Thereafter, he began using the ring name \"Horace Hogan\" to signify his blood ties with Hulk Hogan. He would wrestle for the nWo both in singles competition and tag teaming with the likes of Scott Norton, Stevie Ray, and Vincent, as well as Brian Adams in early 1999 where they came very close to winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship feuding with The Four Horsemen. Hogan also participated in a \"WCW Thunder\" battle royal for leadership of the nWo Hollywood faction. When the nWo Elite and B-Team began to dissolve in 1999, Horace began competing for the WCW Hardcore Championship.\n\nHorace and his uncle began feuding with Billy Kidman and the New Blood in April 2000, with Horace helping Hogan defeat Kidman at Slamboree 2000 on May 7, 2000. Hogan defected to the New Blood, however, after the leader of the New Blood, Eric Bischoff, offered him Kidman's girlfriend Torrie Wilson in exchange for his assistance. Horace feuded with his uncle until the 2000 Great American Bash on June 11, 2000, when he refereed a rematch between Kidman and his uncle fairly, allowing his uncle to defeat Kidman after interference from Torrie who gave Hulk brass knuckles, which he would use to get the win. After Hulk Hogan left WCW in July 2000 due to a legitimate incident with Vince Russo that happened at that year's Bash at the Beach pay-per-view, Horace left the promotion.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Bollea began wrestling around the world, appearing with promotions including the X Wrestling Federation, the World Wrestling Council and Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.\n\nIn 2002, Bollea was signed to a developmental contract by World Wrestling Entertainment. He was assigned to the Ohio-based Heartland Wrestling Association development territory. In September, Bollea was recalled to the main roster, wrestling dark matches for the \"SmackDown\" brand. He remained with WWE until being released later that month. Following his release, Bollea wrestled briefly on the independent circuit before retiring from professional wrestling to work in the construction industry.\n\nBollea is the son of Alan Bollea, brother of professional wrestler Terry \"Hulk Hogan\" Bollea, making him Hogan's nephew. Bollea's parents separated when he was a child. In 1986, his mother, Martha Alfonso, was murdered by her boyfriend, and his father died of a drug overdose. Bollea has two sisters.\n\nThe late professional wrestler Michael \"Mike Awesome\" Alfonso was Bollea's cousin. The duo were childhood friends, with Bollea encouraging Alfonso to wrestle and helping him secure a job with World Championship Wrestling in the late 1990s.\n\nBollea has two daughters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1866873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866873", "title": "Kodaira dimension", "text": "Kodaira dimension\n\nIn algebraic geometry, the Kodaira dimension \"κ\"(\"X\") measures the size of the canonical model of a projective variety \"X\".\n\nIgor Shafarevich introduced an important numerical invariant of surfaces with the notation \"κ\" in the seminar Shafarevich 1965. extended it and defined the Kodaira dimension for higher dimensional varieties (under the name of canonical dimension), and later named it after Kunihiko Kodaira in .\n\nThe canonical bundle of a smooth algebraic variety \"X\" of dimension \"n\" over a field is the line bundle of \"n\"-forms,\n\nwhich is the \"n\"th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of \"X\".\nFor an integer \"d\", the \"d\"th tensor power of \"K\" is again a line bundle.\nFor \"d\" ≥ 0, the vector space of global sections \"H\"(\"X\",\"K\") has the remarkable property that it is a birational invariant of smooth projective varieties \"X\". That is, this vector space is canonically identified with the corresponding space for any smooth projective variety which is isomorphic to \"X\" outside lower-dimensional subsets.\n\nFor \"d\" ≥ 0, the\n\"d\"th plurigenus of \"X\" is defined as the dimension of the vector space\nof global sections of \"K\":\n\nThe plurigenera are important birational invariants of an algebraic variety. In particular, the simplest way to prove that a variety is not rational (that is, not birational to projective space) is to show that some plurigenus \"P\" with \"d\" > 0\nis not zero. If the space of sections of \"K\" is nonzero, then there is a natural rational map from \"X\" to the projective space\n\ncalled the \"d\"-canonical map. The canonical ring \"R\"(\"K\") of a variety \"X\" is the graded ring \n\nAlso see geometric genus and arithmetic genus.\n\nThe Kodaira dimension of \"X\" is defined to be formula_5 if the plurigenera \"P\" are zero for all \"d\" > 0; otherwise, it is the minimum κ such that \"P/d\" is bounded. The Kodaira dimension of an \"n\"-dimensional variety is either formula_5 or an integer in the range from 0 to \"n\".\n\nThe following integers are equal if they are non-negative. A good reference is , Theorem 2.1.33.\n\n\nWhen one of these numbers is undefined or negative, then all of them are. In this case, the Kodaira dimension is said to be negative or to be formula_5. Some historical references define it to be −1, but then the formula formula_13 does not always hold, and the statement of the Iitaka conjecture becomes more complicated. For example, the Kodaira dimension of formula_14 is formula_5 for all varieties \"X\".\n\nThe Kodaira dimension gives a useful rough division of all algebraic varieties into several classes.\n\nVarieties with low Kodaira dimension can be considered special, while varieties of maximal Kodaira dimension are said to be of general type.\n\nGeometrically, there is a very rough correspondence between Kodaira dimension and curvature: negative Kodaira dimension corresponds to positive curvature, zero Kodaira dimension corresponds to flatness, and maximum Kodaira dimension (general type) corresponds to negative curvature.\n\nThe specialness of varieties of low Kodaira dimension is analogous to the specialness of Riemannian manifolds of positive curvature (and general type corresponds to the genericity of non-positive curvature); see classical theorems, especially on \"Pinched sectional curvature\" and \"Positive curvature\".\n\nThese statements are made more precise below.\n\nSmooth projective curves are discretely classified by genus, which can be any natural number \"g\" = 0, 1, ...\n\nHere \"discretely classified\" means that for a given genus, there is an irreducible moduli space of curves of that genus.\n\nThe Kodaira dimension of a curve \"X\" is:\n\nCompare with the Uniformization theorem for surfaces (real surfaces, since a complex curve\nhas real dimension 2): Kodaira dimension formula_5 corresponds to positive curvature, Kodaira dimension 0 corresponds to flatness, Kodaira dimension 1 corresponds to negative curvature. Note that most algebraic curves are of general type: in the moduli space of curves, two connected components correspond to curves not of general type, while all the other components correspond to curves of general type. Further, the space of curves of genus 0 is a point, the space of curves of genus 1 has (complex) dimension 1, and the space of curves of genus \"g\" ≥ 2 has dimension 3\"g\" − 3.\n\nThe Enriques–Kodaira classification classifies algebraic surfaces: coarsely by Kodaira dimension, then in more detail within a given Kodaira dimension. To give some simple examples: the product P × \"X\" has Kodaira dimension formula_5 for any curve \"X\"; the product of two curves of genus 1 (an abelian surface) has Kodaira dimension 0; the product of a curve of genus 1 with a curve of genus at least 2 (an elliptic surface) has Kodaira dimension 1; and the product of two curves of genus at least 2 has Kodaira dimension 2 and hence is of general type.\n\nFor a surface \"X\" of general type, the image of the \"d\"-canonical map is birational to \"X\" if \"d\" ≥ 5.\n\nRational varieties (varieties birational to projective space) have Kodaira dimension formula_5. Abelian varieties (the compact complex tori that are projective) have Kodaira dimension zero. More generally, Calabi–Yau manifolds (in dimension 1, elliptic curves; in dimension 2, abelian surfaces, K3 surfaces, and quotients of those varieties by finite groups) have Kodaira dimension zero (corresponding to admitting Ricci flat metrics).\n\nAny variety in characteristic zero that is covered by rational curves (nonconstant maps from P), called a uniruled variety, has Kodaira dimension −∞. Conversely, the main conjectures of minimal model theory (notably the abundance conjecture) would imply that every variety of Kodaira dimension −∞ is uniruled. This converse is known for varieties of dimension at most 3.\n\nA fibration of normal projective varieties \"X\" → \"Y\" means a surjective morphism with connected fibers.\n\nFor a 3-fold \"X\" of general type, the image of the \"d\"-canonical map is birational to \"X\" if \"d\" ≥ 61.\n\nA variety of general type \"X\" is one of maximal Kodaira dimension (Kodaira dimension equal to its dimension):\n\nEquivalent conditions are that the line bundle formula_21 is big, or that the \"d\"-canonical map is generically injective (that is, a birational map to its image) for \"d\" sufficiently large.\n\nFor example, a variety with ample canonical bundle is of general type.\n\nIn some sense, most algebraic varieties are of general type. For example, a smooth hypersurface of degree \"d\" in the \"n\"-dimensional projective space is of general type if and only if formula_22. In that sense, most smooth hypersurfaces in projective space are of general type.\n\nVarieties of general type seem too complicated to classify explicitly, even for surfaces. Nonetheless, there are some strong positive results about varieties of general type. For example, Enrico Bombieri showed in 1973 that the \"d\"-canonical map of any complex surface of general type is birational for every formula_23. More generally, Christopher Hacon and James McKernan, Shigeharu Takayama, and Hajime Tsuji showed in 2006 that for every positive integer \"n\", there is a constant formula_24 such that the \"d\"-canonical map of any complex \"n\"-dimensional variety of general type is birational when formula_25.\n\nThe birational automorphism group of a variety of general type is finite.\n\nLet \"X\" be a variety of nonnegative Kodaira dimension over a field of characteristic zero, and let \"B\" be the canonical model of \"X\", \"B\" = Proj \"R\"(\"X\", \"K\"); the dimension of \"B\" is equal to the Kodaira dimension of \"X\". There is a natural rational map \"X\" – → \"B\"; any morphism obtained from it by blowing up \"X\" and \"B\" is called the Iitaka fibration. The minimal model and abundance conjectures would imply that the general fiber of the Iitaka fibration can be arranged to be a Calabi–Yau variety, which in particular has Kodaira dimension zero. Moreover, there is an effective Q-divisor Δ on \"B\" (not unique) such that the pair (\"B\", Δ) is klt, \"K\" + Δ is ample, and the canonical ring of X is the same as the canonical ring of (\"B\", Δ) in degrees a multiple of some \"d\" > 0. In this sense, \"X\" is decomposed into a family of varieties of Kodaira dimension zero over a base (\"B\", Δ) of general type. (Note that the variety \"B\" by itself need not be of general type. For example, there are surfaces of Kodaira dimension 1 for which the Iitaka fibration is an elliptic fibration over P.)\n\nGiven the conjectures mentioned, the classification of algebraic varieties would largely reduce to the cases of Kodaira dimension formula_5, 0 and general type. For Kodaira dimension formula_5 and 0, there are some approaches to classification. The minimal model and abundance conjectures would imply that every variety of Kodaira dimension formula_5 is uniruled, and it is known that every uniruled variety in characteristic zero is birational to a Fano fiber space. The minimal model and abundance conjectures would imply that every variety of Kodaira dimension 0 is birational to a Calabi-Yau variety with terminal singularities.\n\nThe Iitaka conjecture states that the Kodaira dimension of a fibration is at least the sum of the Kodaira dimension of the base and the Kodaira dimension of a general fiber; see for a survey. The Iitaka conjecture helped to inspire the development of minimal model theory in the 1970s and 1980s. It is now known in many cases, and would follow in general from the minimal model and abundance conjectures.\n\nNakamura and Ueno proved the following additivity formula for complex manifolds (). Although the base space is not required to be algebraic, the assumption that all the fibers are isomorphic is very special. Even with this assumption, the formula can fail when the fiber is not Moishezon.\n\n"}

M. Kaye, published in 1978, which tells the story of an English officer during the British Raj. There are many parallels between this novel and Rudyard Kipling's \"Kim\" that was published in 1900: the settings, the young English boy raised as a native by an Indian surrogate mother, \"the Great Game\" as it was played by the British Empire and Imperial Russia. The novel, rooted deeply in the romantic epics of the 19th century, has been hailed as a masterpiece of storytelling. It is based partly on biographical writings of the author's grandfather as well as her knowledge of and childhood experiences in India. It has sold millions of copies, caused travel agents to create tours that visited the locations in the book, and inspired a television adaptation and a musical play.\n\nAshton Pelham-Martyn (Ash) is the son of a British botanist travelling through India, who is born on the road shortly before the Sepoy uprising of 1857. His mother dies from childbed fever shortly after his birth and his father dies of cholera a few years later. He is entrusted to his Hindu \"ayah\" (nanny) Sita to be brought to his English relatives in the city of Mardan. After discovering that all English \"feringhis\" have been killed during the uprising, Sita adopts the dark-skinned Ash and takes him in search of safety.\n\nThey eventually find refuge in the kingdom of Gulkote where Ashton, now going by the name Ashok, forgets his English parentage and grows up as a native Indian boy. While working as a servant for Lalji, the young \"yuveraj\" (crown prince) of Gulkote, Ashton befriends the neglected princess Anjuli, in addition to the master of stables, Koda Dad, and his son Zarin. At the age of 11, Ashton uncovers a murderous conspiracy against Lalji and learns he himself will be killed for interfering with the plot. Promising Anjuli he will return for her one day, he and Sita escape the palace with assistance from friends Sita and Ashok have made within the palace over the years, and flee from Gulkote. The ailing Sita dies en route, but not before revealing to Ash his true parentage and entrusting him with the letters and money his father gave her before his death.\n\nAshok makes his way to the military division Sita instructed him about, and they recognise him; now known by his English name, Ashton is turned over to English authorities and sent to England for a formal education and military training. At age 19, Ashton returns to India as an officer in the Corps of Guides with Zarin on the Northern Frontier. He quickly finds that his sense of place is torn between his newfound status as Ashton, an English \"sahib\", and Ashok, the native Indian boy he once believed he was.\n\nAfter going AWOL in Afghanistan (to restore the honour of his soldiers, penalized for losing weapons to border raiders) Ash is suspended from The Guides and sent to escort a royal wedding party across India. The party is in fact from the former kingdom of Gulkote, now known as Karidkote after merging with a neighbouring princedom, and Anjuli and her sister Shushila are the princesses to be married. Also in the wedding party is Anjuli's younger brother, the prince Jhoti. After revealing himself as Ashok to Anjuli, Ash falls in love with her, but is unable to act on his feelings as she is not only betrothed to another but belongs to what is now an alien culture, across a divide which they can no longer bridge. Over the months that follow, Ash thwarts a plot to murder Jhoti, and falls into increasing despair over his unrequited love for Anjuli. While caught in a dust storm together, Anjuli reveals her love for Ash, but rebuffs his pleas to run away with him out of duty to her sister as a co-bride in an arranged marriage. Ash is forced to watch Anjuli be married off to the lecherous rana of Bhithor and return to his duties in the military.\n\nTwo years later, Ash receives distressing news that the \"rana\" of Bhithor is dying, and that his wives are to be burned alive in the Hindu ritual of \"suttee\". Racing to Bhithor, Ash and his friends manage to rescue Anjuli and take her to safety; this rescue results in the death of not only Ash's beloved horse but also most of the human members of the party. He insists upon marrying Anjuli, despite the insistence of all other members of his group of acquaintances, including Anjuli, that this is not only unnecessary but against God's Law.\n\nHere the book's focus shifts from the relationship between Ash and Anjuli to England's and Russia's political wrangling in the regions north of what were the Indian borders at the time. In England's desire to expand its territory into Afghanistan, Ash is sent into the country as a spy to relay information that will help England establish a permanent foothold in the area. What follows is an account of the first phase of the Second Afghan War, culminating in the September 1879 uprising that killed the English envoy in Kabul. This part of the story is told mostly from the perspective of Ash's best friend Walter \"Wally\" Hamilton.\n\nAfter the uprising in Kabul, Ash and Anjuli set out in search of a paradise in the Himalayas – \"the far pavilions\" – free of prejudice where they can live out their lives in peace.\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the \"BBC News\" listed \"The Far Pavilions\" on its list of the 100 most influential novels.\n\n\nFor HBO and Goldcrest, and first screened in 1984 in the UK, Peter Duffell directed a five-hour three-part television miniseries based on the novel, starring Ben Cross as Ashton, Amy Irving as Anjuli, Omar Sharif as Koda Dad and Christopher Lee as Kaka-ji Rao. It was HBO's first mini series, the complete version runs for 300 minutes, and the parts were entitled \"Return to India\", \"The Journey to Bhithor\", and \"Wally and Anjuli\". (The current DVD release split each of these parts into two, creating 6 parts each of about 50 minutes, added a credit section at the newly created break in each part, and in addition removed the titlecard names of the original parts.)\n\nA theatrical release of the series, entitled \"Blade of Steel\", ran 140 minutes, cutting half the story. Although conventional in storytelling and photography, the mini series has ample production value (at a budget of $12 million it was the most expensive made-for-cable movie at the time) and is faithful to the book, although cutting short the youth of Ashton before his return to India, and transposing the Afghan rebellion and Ash's rescue of Anjuli. Carl Davis composed the score, which is a much-sought collector's item. Much of the film was shot in the precincts of Samode Palace.\n\nGoldcrest Films invested £6,755,000 in the production and received £4,755,000 causing a loss of £2 million.\n\nA stage musical adaptation of \"The Far Pavilions\", produced by Michael E. Ward, with music composed by Philip Henderson, premiered at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End on 14 April 2005 after two weeks of previews. Despite being booked until 14 January 2006 \"The Far Pavilions\" closed 17 September 2005 as per a 17 August 2005 announcement. The musical received mixed reviews, but its closing early was attributed to a steep drop in ticket sales subsequent to the 7/7 London bombings. Budgeted at 7 million pounds, the musical's cast featured Hadley Fraser as Ashton, Simon Gleeson as Walter, Gayatri Iyer as Anjuli, Kulvinder Ghir as the Rana of Bhithor and Kabir Bedi as Kahn Sahib. \n\nWhile in India in March 2006 (to scatter M M Kaye's ashes over Lake Pichola) Michael E. Ward announced that he had written the script for a sequel to \"The Far Pavilions\" entitled \"Fireflies\" whose projected stage premiere would be in Mumbai in January 2007, with Ward hoping for a subsequent London stage engagement and a film version.

Modern puffed grains are often created using high temperature, pressure, or extrusion.\n\nPeople eat puffed grains in many ways, but it can be as simple as puffed grain alone and with sugar or salt for taste. Commercial products such as corn flakes and Corn Pops mix many ingredients into a homogeneous batter. The batter is then formed into shapes then toasted and/or extruded. This causes them to rise, but not puff or pop. Puffed grains are very healthful if plain, but when other ingredients are mixed with them they lose some of their previous health benefits.\n\nPuffed grains are popular as breakfast cereals and in the form of rice cakes. While it is easy to recognize that cereals came from whole grains, the expansion factor for rice cakes is even greater, and the final product is somewhat more homogeneous.\n\nThe oldest puffed grain was found in west-central New Mexico in 1948 and 1950. Ears of popcorn were found that were up to 4,000 years old. These pieces of puffed grain were smaller than a penny to two inches in size and can be made in a similar way to popping popcorn.\n\nRice has been puffed since ancient times using a technique called hot salt frying in which parboiled rice (e.g. steamed and then dried) is puffed by preheated salt.\n\nThe modern process of making puffed grains was invented by Dr. Alexander P. Anderson in 1901 in Red Wing, Minnesota. He was doing an experiment dealing with the effect of heat and pressure on corn starch granules where he put them in six glass tubes, sealed them, and put them in an oven until they changed color. When Dr. Anderson took them out and cracked them open an explosion happened, he had made the corn starch turn into a puffed, white mass.\nDr. Alexander's invention of puffed grain was first introduced at the World's Fair in St. Louis in 1904. The puffed grain was shot from a battery of eight guns and on a poster, it was called “The Eighth Wonder of the World.”\n\nPuffed rice can be produced using the simple but effective method of hot salt frying. Salt is heated in a pan until it is hot enough to pop rice added to it within seconds. Parboiled or dried pre-cooked rice is added to the heated contents of the pan and stirred. Puffing starts almost immediately and completes in less than a minute and the rice is scooped out by a sieve.\nHigh pressure puffed grain is created by placing whole grains under high pressure with steam in a containment vessel. When the vessel's seal is suddenly broken, the entrained steam then flashes and bloats the endosperm of the kernel, increasing its volume to many times its original size.\n\nPuffed rice or other grains are occasionally found as street food in China, Korea (called \"\"ppeong twigi\"\" 뻥튀기), and Japan (called \"\"pon gashi\"\" ), where hawkers implement the puffing process using an integrated pushcart/puffer featuring a rotating steel pressure chamber heated over an open flame. The great booming sound produced by the release of pressure serves as advertising.\n\nManufacturing puffed grain by venting a pressure chamber is essentially a batch process. To achieve large-scale efficiencies, continuous-process equipment has been developed whereby the pre-cooked cereal is injected into a high pressure steam chamber. It then exits the steam chamber via a Venturi tube to an expansion chamber, where the puffed cereal is collected and conveyed to the next process step. These devices, generally called stream puffing machines, were perfected in the latter half of the 20th century in Switzerland and Italy, but are now available from manufacturers in China as well.\n\nSnacks and food products made from puffed grain include:\n\n\n"}

It is an independent and autonomous member of the Southern Baptist Convention and the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina (BSCNC). As of May 2005 it had 100 members. The church was involved in a 2005 controversy after the pastor allegedly expelled members because of their political views.\n\nThe church was built in 1965.\n\nThe church received mass media attention in May 2005. During a May 2 deacons' meeting, its pastor Chan Chandler allegedly told any members who had supported John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election to leave. This statement was reportedly captured on audio tape. Nine members of the church, including at least one deacon, left the meeting at that point. Chandler then allegedly declared an impromptu business meeting, and a majority of the 20 church members present voted to expel those who left. Chandler had been vocal in earlier months that he considered voting for the Democratic Party tantamount to supporting homosexuality and abortion. Forty church members threatened to terminate their membership in protest against the actions taken at the meeting.\n\nThe BSCNC called the actions attributed to the church leadership \"highly irregular\" and warned that they could threaten the church's tax-exempt status. Groups campaigning for church-state separation called for the Internal Revenue Service to consider removing the church's tax-exempt status on the grounds that it engaged in political advocacy. A writer in \"Christianity Today\" said the negative comments about John Kerry cross a line and could have fomented negative tax action. He noted, however, that the parish suffered from a demographic split. Dubbing it \"Chandlergate\" he noted that according to the \"Raleigh News and Observer\", 35 Chandler followers left the sanctuary when Chandler resigned.\n\nIn speaking to the \"Baptist Press\", Chandler attempted \"to clarify whether the nine people were in fact voted out of the church, Chandler said they initially left voluntarily.\" He also told the Baptist Press: \"I don't know how these folks voted,\" Chandler told Baptist Press. \"And I never endorsed any candidate.\" But he admits he preached about the \"unbiblical values\" of John Kerry, particularly in regard to abortion and homosexuality. He also claimed to have \"mentioned two Republicans' names\" as unbiblical examples. He opined that he made \"negative endorsements\" but \"never a positive endorsement\" of a candidate.>\n\nOn May 10, 2005 Chandler resigned as pastor. He denied that the actions at the meeting were politically motivated, but did not give his version of events. The BSCNC offered to assist the church in healing the rift between the factions.\n\nAt least some of the former parishioners continued to be disgruntled, and contemplated taking further actions, including hiring an attorney.\n\nThe dispute focused attention on the limits, if any, on the relationship of sermonizing from the pulpit and the political activities of religious practitioners. An opposing view is that a church, being a voluntary association, has an inherent right to discipline and choose its members incidental to its rights of Freedom of religion and Freedom of association, which should not be interfered with by the state.\n\n"}

It was founded by local landowner Charles Edward Baring Young in 1886, with buildings designed by the architect William Howard Seth-Smith.\n\nKingham Hill was purpose built by the Christian philanthropist Charles Edward Baring Young in 1886. He put his faith into practice by establishing it as a place where boys with a boarding need could be educated and prepared for life. In the early days the school was a virtually self-sufficient community. It had a farm, a wide range of workshops, a school building, a chapel, a sanatorium and various boarding houses. The Founder ensured that every Kingham boy learned their ‘letters’, gained a trade and had the benefit of understanding the Christian faith. On leaving they could progress to accommodation and opportunities in London or emigrate to a farm the Founder owned in Canada and make their life in the New World. The Kingham Hill Trust, established by the Founder, administers the school and its sister foundation, Oak Hill Theological College in London\n\nKingham Hill School is a small coeducational boarding school and day school for children aged 11–18, set in 100 acres of grounds in the heart of the Cotswold countryside. The school was founded in 1886 and has around 340 pupils split into eleven houses, seven of which are boarding and four for day students.\n\nThe school has a leisure centre, with a swimming pool, Turkish hamam, sauna, fitness suite as well as a dance and drama studio, astro turf, and tennis courts on site. These facilities are available for use by the local community at certain times. In addition to the sports pitches, the School's 100 acres of grounds include parkland, 30 acres of woodland and 8 acres of pasture housing the school's horses, sheep, alpacas, pine martens and goats. The School has recently invested in new facilities including a £4m Maths and Science building built in 2015, a new library completed in 2016 and a new £6M Sports Centre opened in January 2020.\n\n\nThe Lodge houses the upper sixth girls in their own accommodation.\n\n\n"}

It is also found in France and parts of central Europe.\n\nDowny oaks typically grow in dry, lime-rich soils. It is a submediterranean species, growing from the coastline to deep in the continent. Its optimum is in the submediterranean region, characterized by hot dry summers and cool winters with little rain fall. In western and central Europe, downy oak is confined to areas with submediteranean microclimate (gorges, sandplains, steppe slopes) or to coastlines of former lakes.\n\n\"Quercus pubescens\" is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing up to 20 m. Forest-grown trees grow tall, while open-growing trees develop a very broad and irregular crown. They are long-lived, to several hundred years, and eventually grow into very stout trees with trunks up to 2 m in diameter. Open-grown trees frequently develop several trunks. The bark is very rough, light grey and divided into small flakes. Large trees develop very thick whitish bark cracked into deep furrows, similar to the pedunculate oak but lighter in colour.\n\nThe twigs are light purple or whitish, tomentose. The buds are small (3–6 mm) and blunt, light brown. The leaves are leathery usually 4–10 cm long (rarely to 13 cm) and 3–6 cm wide, usually widest beyond the middle. The leaves group at the ends of twigs. The upper leaf surface is dark green and rough, the lower light green. Both leaf surfaces are covered with minute pubescence which is sometimes lost in older leaves by late summer. The young expanding leaves are whitish or pinkish with very soft tomentum. The leaf shape is very variable, divided into 3-7 pairs of deep or shallow lobes, which are usually divided into a few sublobes. The lobes are usually blunt, rarely sharp. The apex is usually wide and round. The base of the leaf is heart shaped, widely rounded or sometimes pointed. The petioles are 4–15 mm (rarely to 22 mm) long, stout and pubescent. The leaves are persistent late into the autumn, remaining green up to early winter. They eventually turn russet or brown and fall off.\n\nThe \"Quercus pubescens\" acorns are light brown to yellow, 8–20 mm long, usually thin and pointed. The acorn cups are light grey to almost white, with pointed, overlapping scales, covered with tomentum. The acorn stalks are thick and pubescent, up to 2 cm long. The acorns usually occur in groups of 2-5 on the same stalk.\n\nThree subspecies are accepted by \"Flora Europaea\":\n\n"}

The story happens in the same world of Rune-Midgard. An evil entity called the Dark Lord wants to create chaos in the world with the help of seven crystals that represent the seven ambitions (also known as the Seven Strengths) who sealed him away years ago.\n\nIt was produced in the first quarter of 2004 and was broadcast on TV Tokyo in Japan. In 2005, it was broadcast on SBS in Korea. It has 26 episodes.\n\nThe Philippine and Brazilian distributor of the game, Level Up! Games, Inc., cooperated with ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation for local licensing and distribution rights of \"Ragnarok the Animation\". The anime series was first premiered in the Philippines on ABS-CBN on October 11, 2004, airing right before \"TV Patrol\". It was the very first anime that aired on the network's \"Primetime Bida\" evening block.\n\nOn January 22, 2007, FUNimation Entertainment announced the U.S. license of \"Ragnarok\" on the website's Kickoff 07.\n\nThe main protagonist, Roan, is a swordsman whose main goal in the anime is to gain power to protect his childhood friend, Yufa. At one point, he believes he has failed in this and goes off alone to get stronger. After a fateful encounter in Byalan, Roan returns to the group as a Crusader, successfully rescuing Yufa. However, as the story progresses, Roan begins to lose sight of his duty. He later realizes his wrong after some advice from the Legendary Witch in Payon and Comodo. However, it was too late as Roan made it only on time to see Yufa leave with her brother. Afterwards, the group heads towards Glast Heim to save Yufa and to stop Dark Lord. On the way, they are confronted by a possessed Yufa who sends a torrent of undead monsters at her friends. After their victory, she teleports them directly to Glast Heim. With the help and sacrifice of the rest of the party, Roan manages to locate Yufa. However, he finds her to be unable to truly hear his words. Tricking Roan, Yufa kisses him, slipping a cursed ruby into his mouth, which he then swallows. Upon realizing this, the cursed ruby begins to kill Roan. Unable to draw his sword, Roan allows Yufa to stab him with a cursed blade. Eventually, Yufa breaks free from her mental bonds and frees Roan from the curse she had set on him with a kiss of true love. Then, he, Yufa and the rest of the surviving group reunite to defeat Dark Lord. In the end, Roan and Yufa were each seen wearing a ring, implying that they are now married.\nThe love interest of Roan, Yufa is an acolyte and Roan's childhood friend. Though she puts on a smile for Roan, it's obvious she's still mourning the loss of her older brother, Keough. When Keough suddenly returns to life as an evil being, she becomes confused and doesn't know whether or not to fight her brother or protect him. Later, in an effort to save the souls under the control of the Moonlight Flower in Payon, she becomes a Priest. Eventually, Roan's ignorance and arrogance pushes Yufa away and prompts her to leave the group (and Roan) behind for her brother, Keough. Keough eventually corrupts Yufa by removing her soul crystal, something that seems to give her the ability to stay pure, and is also consequently one of the key items of Dark Lord's revival. After stabbing Roan in her corrupt state, Keough comes to her in a vision and tells her that he must leave her... but that Roan would protect her in his absence. This vision broke Dark Lord's corruption, and freed Yufa to allow her to see what she had done. Holding the dying Roan in her arms, Yufa kissed her childhood love at last. This kiss of true love destroyed the cursed ruby ailing Roan, allowing the two to stand together against Dark Lord. With the help of her friends and Roan, Yufa sealed Dark Lord away with a Magnus Exorcismus spell. At the end of the series, it is implied that Roan and Yufa married.\nTakius is a mage who wears a blindfold throughout the series and searches the world for the ultimate truth. Her mission for this \"ultimate truth\" was put on her by her teacher, Zephyr (who also gave her the blinder). With the blinder and her original staff intact, Zephyr had the ability to control her. After going mad and being recruited by Dark Lord, he uses this ability to manipulate Takius in favor of Dark Lord's plans. Eventually, Takius is able to conquer her internal struggles, breaking free from her ties with him and removing the blinder permanently. To further this transformation she became a Sage, resulting in one final confrontation with the one man she ever loved. During the final battle with Zephyr, her master was betrayed by the Dark Lord, who had been using Zephyr from the beginning. As a result, he falls from a collapsing wall, only to be saved just in time by Takius. However, just then, Zephyr's Lord of Vermillion spell was activated, curshing the platform the two were dangling from and both of them fell. This wouldn't be Takius's last appearance in the anime. The voice of Takius would come to Roan during the final battle, encouraging Roan to fight on for he had lost all hope vaguely implying that Takius has survived the Lord of Vermillion spell Zephyr summoned. Takius's staff would then come crashing down from the air, cancelling the Meteor Storm spell Dark Lord was using (somehow, the wand seems to contain a Sage class magic called Spellbreaker, which is the reason of the spell cancelling effect). Roan carries out her wand as a memory of her. Her real name is , but hates being called that for unknown reasons.\nMaya is the merchant in the group and usually joins parties to steal loot and make off with their money. Her rather disagreeable way of doing things comes from a tragic event in her childhood where she was beaten in her \"hometown\" of Alberta after trying to sell apples with her self-made cart. She met Roan and Yufa in the Prontera Sewers when they saved her from a large number of Thief Bugs. In return, she saves them by delivering a Blue Potion to Yufa during their fight with a Golden Thief Bug. She later changes her rather roguish ways after becoming attached to Yufa and the rest of the group. She has a known affinity for monsters, never being seen without her pet Poring named Poy-Poy. In Episode 7, she befriends an \"Alice\" (monster who resembles a human maid) but sadly she meets a tragic end because of the actions of Zealotus (a half monster who despises humans) in Episode 19. In their final confrontation in Comodo, Maya nearly kills Jiltus for revenge but Alice's spirit comes to Maya and convinces her to forgive Zealotus. She then makes peace with Zealotus, but too little too late. Maya only ever uses two skills in the series, Mammonite and Cart Revolution. Maya is the only member of the group to not \"advance\" to another job. She does, however, throw potions much like an Alchemist.\nJudia is a hunter; her bow skills aren't that good at first, but after a chance encounter with Iruga, she improves a great deal. Having bow skills, she can also use the skill \"Double Strafe\". She can also read tarot cards. She falls in love with Iruga and comes to understand what he's trying to do in fighting Keough as he is. When she teams up with Roan's group, she gets jealous after Yufa holds his hand and keeps calling him \"Big Brother Iruga\". By the end of the anime, she has Iruga's child which was the product of giving her life force to Iruga when he was injured with a sword which is enchanted with poison (can be seen in the end of episode 17 and the beginning of episode 18). In the Japanese version she speaks with a Kansai accent; in the Philippine version she speaks in the Bisaya accent, while in English version; she speaks Southern American or Texas English.\nLike Yufa is childhood friends with Roan, Iruga is childhood friends with Keough and is an assassin. After witnessing his friend \"die\" in Glast Heim, Iruga decided to protect both Yufa and Roan in Keough's memory.\n\nLater on in his travels, he meets an amateur female hunter by the name of Judia. After saving her from a couple of bandits, they become companions (or rather she just follows him). When Iruga finds out Keough is alive and now working for evil, he fights his former friend in an effort to bring the real Keough back. During one confrontation, he becomes gravely injured, and is forced to battle Keough in a weakened state numerous times. In the final battle in Glast Heim, Iruga and Keough fatally struck each other at the same time. However, Iruga managed to stab Keough's wound, freeing his friend's heart from the evil the Dark Lord placed in it. Unfortunately, within the process, Keough dies with Iruga.\n\nA pink ball-shaped creature that Maya has as a pet.\nYufa's elder brother, a knight, and currently a subordinate of the Dark Lord.\nKeough is childhood friends with Iruga and accompanied him to investigate Glast Heim. The ruins proved to be too much for the group and forced them to flee. However, their escape route was blocked by an Abysmal Knight. Despite Iruga's protests, Keough distracted the knight as Iruga got Roan and Yufa out. However, before Iruga could make it back Keough was stabbed and the doors of Glast Heim closed. In the beginning it is assumed he died, but the group later learns that he was brainwashed and corrupted by the Dark Lord. Keough's stab wound was made by a \"Blade Lost in Darkness,\" which would become symbolic to what he had become. His main purpose would be to lure Yufa to join the dark side, for she was holding a soul crystal vital for Dark Lord's revival. Merely seconds from death, Keough reforms and apologizes to Iruga for everything. His soul later appears in Yufa's dream sequence telling her not to choose the path he had taken, and to follow Roan for he would protect her. Iruga nicknames him after he turns to the dark side.\nZealotus is the offspring of a monster father and a human mother. Because of the prejudice of her monster half, Zealotus and her mother were forced to leave their village. The cruelty of the villagers left a deep hatred of humans in Zealotus' heart. After her mother's death, Zealotus lived among the monsters and became a cruel being. A chance encounter with Baphomet made her rethink her lifestyle until she is approached by Dark Lord to serve him. She was first seen in Prontera Sewers, manipulating the actions of the Golden Thief Bug. During the anime, she has a particular dislike for Maya because of Maya's love for monsters and relationship with Alice. They eventually resolve their differences. In the end, she sacrifice her life to protect Maya as a sign of their friendship. Her spirit would appear before Maya during the final battle and instruct her on how to defeat the Dark Lord.\nZealotus is an actual monster in the game.\nZephyr is a wizard, and Takius's teacher. He possesses similar characteristics to The Joker. He has a high-pitched laugh and does some very goofy antics throughout the anime, from laughing for no apparent reason, to fighting Roan with a candy cane. However, all that cannot seem to hide his incredible power, knowledge of magic, and his utter insanity. Zephyr once had a family, but they had lost their lives due to a failed experiment of his. Coupled with the ridicule of the public, Zephyr was driven insane to the point where he could be easily manipulated by the Dark Lord. The anime is vague on whether he went insane during teaching Takius or after. He is eventually saved by his former pupil, but too late for both of them. In the anime, Zephyr was the only character to have attained an \"aura\" which signifies the ultimate power he has gained through mercilessly killing hundreds of monsters and people (in \"Ragnarok Online\" it instead represents reaching level 99).\n\nThe main antagonist of the series, the Dark Lord is the greatest representation of evil within Rune-Midgard. He shows a noticeable superiority to all other monsters in the anime, and proves to be the world's greatest threat, despite being sealed away long ago by the \"Seven Ambitions.\" He is so cunning and devious, he manages to convince three of the seven souls he needs to be revived to work for him. From several scenes, it seems that the Dark Lord consists of two identities, both being equally evil. There is no apparent difference between the two identities, seemingly only shown to explain the different voices of this villain. Dark Lord is an actual MVP (boss) in Ragnarok Online.\nA towering, horned goat-like being who is the first to best the entire group of protagonists, possessing immense power, but obviously not fighting to the fullest in his fights (and often toying with his opponents). Though considered evil at first, he shows mercy by sparing the group and then respect when Judia rescues his son. It seems the Baphomet was one of the greatest beings preventing Dark Lord's revitalization, though he never directly interferes until the end. It is unknown whether or not Baphomet is stronger than the Dark Lord. At one point in the series it is revealed that Baphomet is concerned for the \"balance of good and evil\" which could explain why he opposes Dark Lord while being the evil himself. His weapon is a large hammer in the anime, while in the game he uses a purple scythe. Baphomet is an actual MVP (boss) in the game.\nA shapeshifting witch who was responsible for a tragedy at Comodo many years ago (although it has been implied that it was just a misinterpreted tale). She seems to be associated with Baphomet, but is a largely mysterious character. She has a particular interest in Roan. She first changed into a Crusader in Izlude Island and saves Roan and convinces him to become a Crusader. Then she changes into an Archer in Payon to teach him the true path that power isn't everything and finally a Monk when Roan is trapped in a cave near Comodo, teaching him not to use the sword arrogantly and that pure strength is not enough. In her last appearance to Roan, she (and two dancers indirectly) teach Roan to tell the enemies moves and gives him a sword that was used to seal herself away, entrusting him to use it to protect those he loved.\n\nJapan, Indonesia, and Philippines have held some sort of in-game events to commemorate the release of the anime.

Brown, although \"the Ash'ari school of theology is often called the Sunni Sufi 'orthodoxy,'\" \"the original ahl al-hadith, early Sufi creed from which Ash'arism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni 'orthodoxy' as well.\" According to Brown this competing orthodoxy exists in the form of the \"Hanbali über-Sunni orthodoxy\".\n\nAl-Ashʿarī was notable for taking an intermediary position between the two diametrically opposed schools of theological thought prevalent at the time. He opposed both the Muʿtazilites, who advocated the extreme use of reason in theological debate and believed the Quran was created, as opposed to uncreated. Ashari refuted this by stating \"if the Quran was created then that implied God created this knowledge, and thus did not have knowledge of the Quran before this, and this contradicts God's omnipotence as he is all knowing, and therefore must have always had knowledge of the Quran\". The Zahirites, Mujassimites and Muhaddithin, were also opposed to the use of philosophy or \"kalam\", and condemned any theological debate altogether.\n\nAl-Ashʿari's school eventually won \"wide acceptance within some sects of Sunni Islam. However Shiaism do not accept his beliefs, as Ashari's works involved refuting shiaism and the mutazila, which was the doctrine held by shiaism. His original versions of his text were not survived. Due to his efforts, Al-Ashʿarī came to be revered by sects of Sunni Sufi Muslims for having successfully \"integrated the rationalist methodology of the speculative theologians into the framework of Sufi orthodox Islam.\"\n\nAl-Ash'ari was born in Basra, Iraq, and was a descendant of the famous companion of Muhammad, Abu Musa al-Ashari. As a young man he studied under al-Jubba'i, a renowned teacher of Muʿtazilite theology and philosophy. He remained a Muʿtazalite until his fortieth year and he abandoned al-Jubba'i's doctrines in his fortieth year after asking him a question al-Jubba'i failed to resolve over the issue of the supposed divine obligation to abandon the good for the sake of the better (al-sâlih wa al-aslah). At that time he adopted the doctrines of the sifatiyya, those of Ahlu-s-Sunnah. He left Basra and came to Baghdad, taking fiqh from the Shafi`i jurist Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi (d. 340). He devoted the next twenty-four years to the refutation of \"the Mu`tazila, the Rafida, the Jahmiyya, the Khawarij, and the rest of the various kinds of innovators\" in the words of al-Khatib. His student Bundar related that his yearly expenditure was a meagre seventeen dirhams. His three best-known disciples were al-Bāhilī, aṣ-Ṣuʿlūkī, and Ibn Mujāhid, all of whom transmitted the doctrines of their master to what later became the flourishing school of Khorāsān. After al-Ashʿarī died, his disciples slowly disentangled the main lines of doctrine that eventually became the stamp of the Ashʿarite school.\n\nAl-Ash'ari saw Muhammad in a dream 3 times in Ramadan. The first time, Muhammad told him to support what was related from himself, that is, the traditions (hadiths). Al-Ash'ari became worried as he had numerous strong proofs contradictory to the traditions. After 10 days, he saw Muhammad again: Muhammad reiterated that he should support the traditions. So Al-Ash'ari forsook Kalam and started following the traditions alone. On the 27th night of Ramadan, he saw Muhammad for the last time. Muhammad told him that he had not commanded him to forsake Kalam, he had only told him to support the traditions narrated from him (Muhammad). Thereupon Al-Ash'ari started to advocate the Hadith, finding proofs for these that he said he had not read in any books.\n\nAfter this experience, he left the Muʿtazalites and became one of its most distinguished opponents, using the philosophical methods he had learned. Al-Ash'ari then spent the remaining years of his life engaged in developing his views and in composing polemics and arguments against his former Muʿtazalite colleagues. He is said to have written up to three hundred works, of which only four or five are known to be extant.\n\nAfter leaving the Muʿtazili school, and joining the side of Traditionalist theologians al-Ash'ari formulated the theology of Sunni Islam. He was followed in this by a large number of distinguished scholars, most of whom belonged to the Shafi'i school of law. The most famous of these are Abul-Hassan Al-Bahili, Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, al-Juwayni, Al-Razi and Al-Ghazali. Thus Al-Ash'ari's school became, together with the Maturidi, the main schools reflecting the beliefs of the Sunnah.\n\nIn line with Sunni tradition, al-Ash'ari held the view that a Muslim should not be considered an unbeliever on account of a sin even if it were an enormity such as drinking wine or theft. This opposed the position held by the Khawarij.\n\nAl-Ash'ari also believed it impermissible to violently oppose a leader even if he were openly disobedient to the commands of the sacred law.\n\nAl-Ash'ari spent much of his works opposing the views of the Muʿtazili school. In particular, he rebutted them for believing that the Qur'an was created and that deeds are done by people of their own accord. He also rebutted the Muʿtazili school for denying that Allah can hear, see and has speech. Al-Ash’ari confirmed all these attributes stating that they differ from the hearing, seeing and speech of creatures, including man.\n\nHe was also noted for his teachings on atomism. The Salafis argue that he had accepted the Salafi theology before his death.\n\nThe 18th century Islamic scholar Shah Waliullah stated: \n\nEarlier major scholars also held positive views of al-Ash'ari and his efforts, among them Qadi Iyad and Taj al-Din al-Subki.\n\nThe Ashari scholar Ibn Furak numbers Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari's works at 300, and the biographer Ibn Khallikan at 55; Ibn Asāker gives the titles of 93 of them, but only a handful of these works, in the fields of heresiography and theology, have survived. The three main ones are:\n\nOther titles are:\n\n\nIstihsan al-Khawd fi `Ilm al-Kalam (ambiguous because he most likely wrote it - provided he actually authored it - before his conversion, since it is ostensibly directed against the Hanbalis and uses markedly Mu`tazili terminology such as \"divine Oneness and Justice\" (al-tawhîd wa al-`adl) in reference to the fundamentals of belief, and Allah knows best)\n\nHowever, George Makdisi and Ignác Goldziher consider this work as genuine, and Salafists maintain that the book marks al-Ash'ari's late repentance and his return to the beliefs of the salaf. Salafists expound that the book was written after he recanted his earlier beliefs and accepted Athari beliefs, following his encounter with the Hanbalite scholar Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari, and was primarily an attempt to call his previous followers back to Islam. Professor Sherman Jackson recounts that Ibn Taymiyyah, citing the Ash'ari Historian Ibn `Asakir, presented Al-Ashari's words in the Ibāna as a defense during his trial on charges of anthropomorphism.\n\n\n"}

A university-based school of theology, Candler educates ministers, scholars of religion and other leaders. It is also one of 13 seminaries affiliated with the United Methodist Church.\n\nCandler School of Theology is grounded in the Christian faith and shaped by the Wesleyan tradition of evangelical piety, ecumenical openness, and social concern. Its mission as a university-based school of theology is to educate—through scholarship, teaching, and service—faithful and creative leaders for the church's ministries throughout the world.\n\nIn March 1914, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MECS) and Vanderbilt University, a flagship institution of higher education for the church, severed ties. MECS appointed an Educational Commission to establish a university in the Southeast that would be a place where pastors-in-training at Vanderbilt could continue their education by the fall.\n\nAsa Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother of commission chair Warren Candler, promised one million dollars for the endowment of the southeastern university. The commission voted unanimously to locate it in Atlanta.\n\nEmory College in Oxford, Georgia, agreed to become the undergraduate division of the university and the university was given the name Emory University in recognition of the college's history.\n\nIn September 1914, the theology school began instruction at Wesley Memorial Church, moving to the Druid Hills campus in 1916. In 1915, the Emory University trustees voted to name the theology school Candler, though the meeting minutes don’t indicate definitively whether the name is in honor of Warren or Asa Candler.\n\nIn 1922, Candler faculty elected to offer admission to female students, despite the fact that the Methodist Episcopal Church, South did not offer a path to ordination for women. It wasn’t until 1938 that Mary Vaughn Johnson became the first woman to be awarded Emory's bachelor of divinity degree.\n\nThe United States’ involvement in World War II decreased enrollment at Candler, and focused the school's training of remaining students for military chaplaincy, a vocation that half of the graduating class of 1943 pursued. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a 1940 graduate of Candler, was serving a Methodist church in Hiroshima when the atomic bomb is dropped. Tanimoto later devoted his life to helping the survivors and speaking out for nuclear disarmament.\n\nDespite the U.S. Supreme Court's \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision in 1954, Georgia resisted attempts at racial integration. In 1957, 80 white religious leaders signed what became known as the “Ministers’ Manifesto” calling for an end to segregation in the city's schools. A year later, Atlanta newspapers published another open letter from Emory faculty and administrators reiterating the need to integrate the public schools; nearly the entire theology faculty signed the letter. In 1965, Candler's first black student, Otis Turner, enrolled.\n\nIn 1971, Charles Gerkin led the design of a three-year program of supervised ministry as a curriculum requirement. In addition to field placements at sites ranging from hospitals and homeless shelters to local churches, the program also included time for reflection seminars led by faculty. This program came to be known as Contextual Education, or ConEd.\n\nIn 1974, the Anglican Studies program began. Later renamed Episcopal Studies, the program is the oldest university-based Episcopal ministry education program in the country.\n\nIn 1975, Candler librarian Channing Jeschke persuaded Dean James T. Laney to purchase the Hartford Theological Seminary library collection, which grew the library's holdings from 90,000 volumes to more than 300,000. That same year, the theology building began renovations to serve as a library for the new collection. In 1976, the building was renamed Pitts Theology Library in recognition of Margaret Pitts and her father, William I.H. Pitts, and the Pitts Foundation's assistance in purchasing the Hartford collection.\n\nIn 1978, Roberta C. Bondi became the first female faculty member on the tenure track of the theology school. Though Candler had employed female visiting professors and untenured lecturers, Bondi's appointment marked the first time a woman was officially on faculty.\n\nThat same year, Paul Rudolph was retained to design a new chapel, and in 1979, U.S. President Jimmy Carter presided over the groundbreaking of Cannon Chapel, named in honor of former dean William R. Cannon.\n\nIn 1990, Robert M. Franklin, Jr. launched Candler's Black Church Studies Program. Franklin later would become president of Morehouse College and returned to Candler in 2014 as the inaugural James T. and Berta R. Laney Chair of Moral Leadership.\n\nIn 1991, the Program in Women's Studies was launched under part-time director Kris Kvam; it would later be renamed the Program for Women in Theology and Ministry. That same year, Nancy Ammerman founded Candler's Baptist Studies Program.\n\nIn 2007, Jan Love became Candler's first female dean.\n\nCandler School of Theology observed its centennial in the 2014-15 academic year with a series of events that acknowledged Candler's contributions to theological education and to the church during the past 100 years; its role within and contribution to Emory University during the past 100 years; its vision for addressing the challenges and opportunities facing theology in the 21st century; and the accomplishments of Candler's faculty, alumni and friends/donors.\n\nThree members of the faculty are fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences: E. Brooks Holifield, Carol A. Newsom, and Carl R. Holladay.\n\nCandler School of Theology has been accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) since 1938. In addition, Emory University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the associate, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels.\n\nCandler School of Theology offers dual degrees in Bioethics, Business, Development Practice, Law, and Public Health with other graduate schools at Emory University, and a dual degree in Social Work with the University of Georgia (UGA).\n\nCandler School of Theology's Contextual Education program integrates coursework, supervised field experience and pastor-led reflection groups. Master of Divinity students are required to fulfill placements in both clinical or social ministry settings in their first year and in ecclesial settings their second year.\n\nCandler School of Theology students may participate in academic programs at international and domestic theological institutions, including The General Theological Seminary, New York City; the National Capital Semester for Seminarians, Washington, D.C.; Universidade Metodista de São Paulo (Methodist University of São Paulo), Brazil; University of Helsinki, Finland; Georg-August Universität, Germany; Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität (LMU), Germany; Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana; St. Paul's University, Kenya; Methodist Theological University (MTU), Korea; Seminario Evangélico de Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico; University of St. Andrew, St Mary's College, School of Divinity, Scotland; Trinity Theological College, Singapore; University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa; Stockholm School of Theology, Sweden; Wesley House – University of Cambridge, United Kingdom; and Africa University, Zimbabwe.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Baptist Studies program prepares students for ordination in the Baptist Church. Candler students enrolled in the Master of Divinity (MDiv) degree program may earn a certificate in Baptist Studies.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Black Church Studies program prepares students for leadership in black and multiracial churches; and teaches the origins, development and contemporary diversity of the black church tradition. Candler students enrolled in the Master of Divinity or Master of Theological Studies degree programs may earn a certificate in Black Church Studies. In addition, the program sponsors events and lectures on black religious life, including the Howard Thurman Lecture, the Anna Julia Cooper Lecture, and the Sankofa Scholar program.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Episcopal Studies program prepares students for ministry in The Episcopal Church and all the churches in the Anglican Communion. Candler students enrolled in the Master of Divinity degree program who are preparing for ordained parish ministry under the supervision of a bishop may earn a certificate in Episcopal Studies.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Methodist Studies program offers a range of courses in Methodist studies, stewards denominational and conference relations, mentors candidates seeking ordination and organizes denominational activities.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Religious Education Ministries program prepares students for educational leadership in congregations, schools and communities. Candler students enrolled in the Master of Divinity, Master of Religious Leadership or Master of Theological Studies degree programs may earn a certificate in Religious Education Ministries. In addition, the program partners with the Youth Theological Initiative.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Women, Theology, and Ministry program educates women and men to be leaders and advocates for the well being of girls and women in the church and in the world. Candler students enrolled in the Master of Divinity or Master of Theological Studies degree programs may earn a certificate in Women, Theology, and Ministry. In addition, the program sponsors lectures, events and networking opportunities.\n\nCandler School of Theology offers continuing education for individuals not enrolled in a degree program through Candler course auditing, seminars, certifications and other theology courses.\n\nThe Course of Study School at Emory educates and trains local pastors in The United Methodist Church, and is sponsored by The United Methodist Church, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, the Southeastern Jurisdictional Administrative Council, and Candler School of Theology.\n\nPitts Theology Library, one of six instructional libraries at Emory University, holds a distinguished collection of theological materials.\n\nWith over 610,000 volumes, the library collection consists primarily of materials related to the development of Christian history and thought. The library also acquires materials in contiguous areas that are related to the history of other religious traditions (especially early Judaism), the interpretation of Jewish and Christian scriptures (e.g., historical and philological works related to the ancient Near East, Greece, and Rome), the history of Christianity (e.g., political and social history of the lands in which Christianity spread), the development of Christian theology (e.g., philosophy, ethics, literature), and the practice of Christian life and ministry (e.g., music, sociology, psychology). While most materials collected are in English, German, French, and Latin, materials in other languages are also acquired as necessary.\n\nThe Pitts Library subscribes to more than 1,100 periodicals, with special strength in titles from sub-Saharan Africa, and typically adds over 7,000 volumes to its collections annually. The Special Collections of the library are extensive, including over 130,000 rare or special books and nearly 2,500 linear feet of unpublished archival materials. These collections include:\nMargaret A. Pitts, a devout Methodist and supporter of its educational institutions, was responsible for much of the library's growth, providing substantial gifts for new acquisitions. In 1976, the library was named in honor of Pitts and her father, W. I. H. Pitts.\n\nIn 2011, Candler School of Theology received a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to create a model curriculum for internationalism for accredited North American seminaries. The grant has enabled the school to develop faculty and student exchanges, organize seminars and propose new forms of pedagogy in order to build and sustain reciprocal relationships with partner schools abroad and transform its curriculum at home.\n\nIn 1993, Dr. Craig Dykstra partnered with Candler School of Theology and Lilly Endowment, Inc. to create the Youth Theological Initiative. Since then, the program has focused on developing theologically-grounded, socially-conscious ministries with youth and young adults, by educating and preparing youth ministers, and leading a summer program for high school students to engage in justice-seeking theological education. In addition, the Initiative conducts research into the theological perspectives of youth.\n\nThe World Methodist Evangelism Institute provides opportunities for pastors and lay persons to earn continuing education credits while gaining experience in evangelism in other cultures, offers training in faith-sharing in a non-confrontational approach, and provides opportunities for seminary students to engage with students from other seminaries across the world. Since its founding in 1982, this joint ministry of Candler School of Theology and the World Methodist Council has sponsored 59 major seminars in more than 121 countries around the world.\n\nThe Certificate in Theological Studies program is a collaborative project of the Atlanta Theological Association (ATA) and Arrendale State Prison’s Chaplaincy Department. It is a yearlong program of theological education for incarcerated women, with classes designed and taught by graduate students and faculty from four ATA schools: Candler School of Theology, McAfee School of Theology at Mercer University, the Interdenominational Theological Center and Columbia Theological Seminary.\n\nA variety of prizes in recognition of vocational and academic achievements by students and staff are awarded annually at the Candler School of Theology Honors Day. Awards for vocational excellence and community service include the Claude H. Thompson Award for work in the area of justice and reconciliation, the Berta and James T. Laney Award in Contextual Education, the Charles Owen Smith Award, the Fellowship Seminarian Award, the Hoyt Hickman Award, the Community Service Award, the John Owen Smith Award, the Ruth Sewell Flowers Award, and the Frederick Buechner Prize for Excellence in Preaching.\n\nAwards for academic excellence include the United Methodist Foundation for Christian Higher Education Award, the United Methodist First Career Seminary Award, the United Methodist Scholarship Seminary Award, the Myki Mobley Award, the Nolan B. Harmon Award, the John D. and Alice Slay Award, the Chad Davis Memorial Award, the Boone M. Bowen Award, the Russell E. Richey Award, the G. Ray Jordan Award, and the Academic Excellence Awards.\n\nCompleted in 2008, the 65,000-square-foot Rita Anne Rollins Building houses Candler School of Theology classrooms, administrative and faculty offices, community gathering spaces, and Emory's Center for Ethics. The building supports SMART technology and reflects Emory's architectural style and its commitment to sustainability, featuring Italianate design with marble and stucco exteriors and a clay tile roof, as well as LEED silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nIn recognition of the support of the O. Wayne Rollins Foundation of Atlanta, Emory University named Phase I of the new Candler School of Theology building in memory of the late Rita Anne Rollins.\n\nCandler School of Theology's Phase II building project was completed in August 2014 and connects the classrooms and administrative offices in the Rita Anne Rollins Building with the Pitts Theology Library, as well as the Wesley Teaching Chapel, new group study rooms for students, a glassed-in atrium and an outdoor plaza.\n\nThe building is located at 1531 Dickey Drive.\n\nCandler's Phase II building project is connected to the Rita Anne Rollins Building. Completed in August 2014, the building includes a new home for Pitts Theology Library, an exhibit gallery, an 80-seat lecture hall, the Wesley Teaching Chapel, group study rooms, a glassed-in atrium, an outdoor plaza and office space for Candler's IT staff and Pitts Library staff. Like the Rita Anne Rollins Building, the building supports wireless technology and reflects Emory's iconic architectural style and its commitment to sustainability, with expected LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nFor its first 99 years, Pitts Theology Library was housed in the oldest building on the Emory Campus, constructed in 1915. The School of Theology originally occupied the top floor, and the university chapel occupied the Durham Reading Room. The original library for the School of Theology was held in the room that most recently contained the periodical collection.\n\nPitts Library moved to the Phase II building in 2014. The library now provides an elevator, wireless access, expanded seating options, and enhanced accessibility, as well as proximity to the classrooms and staff offices for the Candler School of Theology.\nCannon Chapel, named for William R. Cannon, who was dean of Candler School of Theology and later a bishop of the United Methodist Church, was designed by internationally acclaimed architect Paul Rudolph, son of one of Candler School of Theology's first graduates. Ground was broken for the chapel on August 30, 1979, by President Jimmy Carter. The building was consecrated on September 30, 1981.\n\nThe building houses the office of the Dean of the Chapel, Candler School of Theology's Office of Worship, a large chapel, meeting space, and academic classrooms. Weekly services including Catholic mass and University Worship take place in this building.\n\nCandler School of Theology holds an extensive collection of the work of Los Angeles artist John August Swanson. Noted for his finely detailed, brilliantly colored paintings and original prints, Swanson has works displayed in some of the world's most prestigious venues, including three museums of the Smithsonian Institution: The National Museum of American History, The Smithsonian American Art Museum and The National Air and Space Museum, The Art Institute of Chicago, London's Tate Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum, the Vatican Museums’ Collection of Modern Religious Art, and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, among others. Candler's holdings—currently 55 pieces—comprise the largest single collection of Swanson's art in the world.\n\nThe Aquinas Center of Theology, the Center for the Study of Law and Religion, the Graduate Division of Religion, Methodist Review, Office of Religious Life, and the \"Practical Matters\" Journal are among many organizations at Emory or affiliated with the university that are associated with the work and programs of Candler.\n\n\nBowen, Boone M. \"The Candler School of Theology: Sixty Years of Service\" (Atlanta: Emory University, 1974).\n\n\"Candler School of Theology\", in \"New Georgia Encyclopedia\".

In 1967, the building was sold off and rented back on a 42-year lease and used for Social Security. The building was empty for several years before becoming home to the Public Guardianship Office in 2001, which became the Court of Protection and the Office of the Public Guardian in 2007. In October 2007, the tower was sold by Wichford plc to Scarborough Property Group. The Court and the Office of the Public Guardian vacated the building in 2011.\n\nAfter sitting vacant for 2 years, Essential Living purchased Archway Tower in 2013 for £6 million, with plans to make the building \"one of the country’s biggest office to residential conversions\".\n\nThe project involved the change of use from commercial to residential and a re-cladding.\n\nThe change of use and refurbishment of a 50-year-old building presented Essential Living with significant challenges to overcome.\n\nWhilst the 1960s construction was very robust, the construction tolerances acceptable in that period are very different to those typically allowed these days. This meant that interfaces between the old structure and the new façade needed to be very well thought through and detailed.

It deals with the coming and death of Joachim Stiller, a messiah-like figure, and has magical-realist elements in it. A film based on the novel was made in 1976.\n\nThe main character in the novel is Freek Groenevelt, a 37-year-old journalist living in Antwerp. From a café, he witnesses four workers breaking up a street and then closing it up again, for no apparent reason. When he decides to write an article about the event, he is contacted by a member of the Antwerp city council, Mr. Keldermans.\n\nMr. Keldermans explains to Groenevelt that things are happening which he does not understand and make him afraid. Groenevelt is sceptical at first, but Keldermans seems honest and Groenevelt leaves in a state of confusion.\n\nHe then receives a letter from Joachim Stiller, in which Stiller announces that the event he witnessed is a portent. To Groenevelt's confusion, the letter is stamped one and a half years before he was born.\n\nLater on, Groenevelt goes to visit the editors of a literary magazine, \"Atomium\", which has published a very critical article about him. One of the editors, Simone Marijnissen, explains that they have received a letter from, again, Joachim Stiller, asking them not to criticize Groenevelt. They thought that Groenevelt had written the letter himself and saw this as a reason to attack him.\n\nOver the next few days, Joachim Stiller continues to manifest himself. He writes another letter to Marijnissen, and Groenevelt finds a 16th-century book, written by a German theologian from Augsburg called Joachim Stiller. Groenevelt and Marijnissen (who are fast falling in love with each other) visit an art historian, who determines that the letter is thirty-eight years old: again, just one year older than Groenevelt. A graphologist determines that Stiller's handwriting is exactly what he would expect from a man \"who doesn't exist at all, but could nonetheless write\".\n\nMarijnissen spends the night in Groenevelt's apartment, and they are awakened by the sounds of a carillon, which nobody else seems to hear. Then, the telephone rings, and an unknown person promises: \"One day I will free you from all your fears.\"\n\nThen, as persistent rumours announcing the end of the world start to run around the city, Groenevelt contacts Keldermans, who explains that these rumours have been spread by people unknown. He had detailed some police officers to keep things quiet, but these have disappeared without a trace.\n\nGroenevelt, now understandably nervous, visits a psychiatrist, but apart from high blood pressure, nothing seems to be wrong. He does remember an episode from his early youth, when he witnessed a rocket attack in the Second World War. An American soldier was mortally wounded in the attack, and suddenly Groenevelt remembers the GI's name: Major Joachim Stiller, Longwood, Massachusetts. \n\nWhen Groenevelt comes home, Marijnissen tells him she is expecting their child. Furthermore, a letter from Joachim Stiller has arrived, telling them that he will arrive on Friday evening. \n\nOn Friday evening, Groenevelt and Marijnissen go to the train station, where they meet Keldermans. At half past nine, a man comes out of the station, whom Groenevelt recognises as the American soldier from his youth. The man smiles, and says: \"I am Joachim Stiller\", but immediately after that he is hit by a truck. Later, at the police station, it proves impossible to identify the man.\n\nThree days later, when Groenevelt and Marijnissen try to visit Stiller's body, it has disappeared. Keldermans's connection with Joachim Stiller is also revealed: his daughter has died in the same attack that Groenevelt has witnessed.\n"}

It was a victory for a French force of seven ships over a Dutch force of five ships and the convoy it was escorting.\n\nOn this date the French privateer Jean Bart found a Dutch convoy of 112 merchant ships, escorted by five Dutch ships near Dogger Bank.\n\nThe French had more warships and more cannons than the Dutch. Furthermore, the French crews were very experienced and led by an exceptional commander, so the outcome of the battle was very predictable. But the French had to hurry, because a large English squadron under admiral John Benbow was aware of the French presence and was looking for them.\n\nThe battle started on 19:00 h. when Jean Bart on the \"Maure\" attacked the Dutch flagship, the \"Raadhuis-van-Haarlem\". the Dutch fought valiantly for three hours until their captain was killed. Then they surrendered and so did the 4 other ships, one after another.\n\nJean Bart captured and burned 25 merchant ships until Benbow's squadron of 18 ships approached.

The term was later adopted by the French and Portuguese navies to classify their medium-sized warships designed for colonial service. The term continued to be used in the French Navy to classify the patrol frigates until 2012, when the remaining ships of the class were reclassified as offshore patrol ships. It is similar to the modern use of \"sloop\" in other countries.\n\nThe \"Dictionnaire de la Marine Française 1788–1792\" (by Nicolas-Charles Romme) describes avisos as \"small boats designed to carry orders or dispatches\". This use became obsolete with the development of means of communicating detailed information at a distance.\n\nFrench avisos used during the world wars had displacements of 300–700 tons, speeds of , main armaments usually of two 100 mm guns, two 138 mm guns, or four 100 mm guns. Colonial avisos, such as the intended for overseas service, were larger.\n\nThe Portuguese Navy used avisos to operate in the waters of the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese built 1st rate avisos ( class) of 2,400 tons and 2nd rate avisos ( and \"Pedro Nunes\" classes) of 1,200 to 1,700 tons. In 1932, the Portuguese s were also classified as 2nd rate avisos.\n\nThe term is now used to include combat-capable ships larger than patrol boats, but smaller than corvettes. They typically have roles in anti-submarine warfare and coastal defence. In NATO classification they are usually recognized as corvettes.\n\nThe Argentine Navy has several ships classified as avisos. , an 800-ton aviso used for non-combat tasks, built as a US Navy fleet tug, was attacked and damaged during the 1982 Falklands War.\n\n"}

He currently holds the title of Full Professor at the Computing Sciences Department of Villanova University. Japaridze is best known for his invention of computability logic, cirquent calculus, and Japaridze's polymodal logic.\n\nDuring 1985–1988 Japaridze elaborated the system GLP, known as Japaridze's polymodal logic. This is a system of modal logic with the \"necessity\" operators [0],[1],[2],…, understood as a natural series of incrementally weak provability predicates for Peano arithmetic. In \"The polymodal logic of provability\" Japaridze proved the arithmetical completeness of this system, as well as its inherent incompleteness with respect to Kripke frames. GLP has been extensively studied by various authors during the subsequent three decades, especially after Lev Beklemishev, in 2004, pointed out its usefulness in understanding the proof theory of arithmetic (provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals).\n\nJaparidze has also studied the first-order (predicate) versions of provability logic. He came up with an axiomatization of the single-variable fragment of that logic, and proved its arithmetical completeness and decidability. In the same paper he showed that, on the condition of the 1-completeness of the underlying arithmetical theory, predicate provability logic with non-iterated modalities is recursively enumerable. In he did the same for the predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers.\n\nIn 1992–1993, Japaridze came up with the concepts of cointerpretability, tolerance and cotolerance, naturally arising in interpretability logic. He proved that cointerpretability is equivalent to 1-conservativity and tolerance is equivalent to 1-consistency. The former was an answer to the long-standing open problem regarding the metamathematical meaning of 1-conservativity. Within the same line of research, Japaridze constructed the modal logics of tolerance (1993) and of the arithmetical hierarchy (1994), and proved their arithmetical completeness.\nIn 2002 Japaridze introduced \"the Logic of Tasks\", which later became a part of his Abstract Resource Semantics on one hand, and a fragment of Computability Logic (see below) on the other hand.\n\nJaparidze is best known for founding Computability Logic in 2003 and making subsequent contributions to its evolution. This is a long-term research program and a semantical platform for \"redeveloping logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that it has more traditionally been\".\nIn 2006 Japaridze conceived cirquent calculus as a proof-theoretic approach that manipulates graph-style constructs, termed cirquents, instead of the more traditional and less general tree-like constructs such as formulas or sequents. This novel proof-theoretic approach was later successfully used to \"tame\" various fragments of computability logic, which had otherwise stubbornly resisted all axiomatization attempts using the traditional proof systems such as sequent calculus or Hilbert-style systems. It was also used to (define and) axiomatize the purely propositional fragment of independence-friendly logic.\nThe birth of cirquent calculus was accompanied with offering the associated \"abstract resource semantics\". Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike linear logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to linear logic by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic. This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it.\n\nJaparidze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to intuitionistic logic, criticizing it for lacking a convincing semantical justification the associated constructivistic claims, and for being incomplete as a result of \"throwing out the baby with the bath water\". Heyting's intuitionistic logic, in its full generality, has been shown to be sound but incomplete with respect to the semantics of computability logic. The positive (negation-free) propositional fragment of intuitionistic logic, however, has been proven to be complete with respect to the computability-logic semantics.\nIn \"On the system CL12 of computability logic\", on the platform of computability logic, Japaridze generalized the traditional concepts of time and space complexities to interactive computations, and introduced a third sort of a complexity measure for such computations, termed \"amplitude complexity\".\nAmong Japaridze's contributions is the elaboration of a series of systems of (Peano) arithmetic based on computability logic, named \"clarithmetics\". These include complexity-oriented systems (in the style of bounded arithmetic) for various combinations of time, space and amplitude complexity classes.\n\nGiorgi Japaridze was born in 1961 in Tbilisi, Georgia (then in the Soviet Union).\nHe graduated from Tbilisi State University in 1983, received a PhD degree (in philosophy) from Moscow State University in 1987, and then a second PhD degree (in computer science) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. During 1987–1992 Japaridze worked as a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. During 1992–1993 he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Mathematics and Computer Science department). During 1993–1994 he held the position of a Visiting Associate Professor at the University of Notre Dame (Philosophy Department). He has joined the faculty of Villanova University (Computing Sciences Department). Japaridze has also worked as a Visiting Professor at Xiamen University (2007) and Shandong University (2010–2013) in China.\n\nIn 1982, for his work \"Determinism and Freedom of Will\", Japaridze received a Medal from the Georgian Academy of Sciences for the best student research paper, granted to one student in the nation each year. In 2015, he received an Outstanding Faculty Research Award from Villanova University, granted to one faculty member each year. Japaridze has been a recipient of various grants and scholarships, including research grants from the US National Science Foundation, Villanova University and Shandong University, Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Dutch government, Smullyan Fellowship from Indiana University (never utilized), and Dean's Fellowship from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Similar shifts appeared in prose style.\n\nThe return of the king and his court from exile on the Continent led to the replacement of the Puritan severity of the Cromwellian style with a taste for magnificence and opulence, and to the introduction of Dutch and French artistic influences. These are evident in furniture in the use of floral marquetry, walnut instead of oak, twisted turned supports and legs, exotic veneers, cane seats and backs on chairs, sumptuous tapestry and velvet upholstery, and ornate carved and gilded scrolling bases for cabinets.\n\nRestoration silver is characterized by embossed motifs for tulips and naturalistic fruit and leaves. New types of furniture introduced in this period include cabinets on stands, chests of drawers, armchairs and wing chairs, and day beds.\n\nThe growing power of the English East India Company resulted in increased imports of exotic commodities from China and Japan, including tea, porcelain and lacquer, and chintzes from India. This led to a craze for \"chinoiserie\", reflected in the development of imitation lacquer (Japanning), blue and white decoration on ceramics, flat-chased scenes of Chinese-style figures and landscapes on silver, and new forms of silver such as teapots, as well as colourful Indian-style crewelwork bed-hangings and curtains.\n\nOther developments in the Restoration period were the emergence of the English glass industry, following the invention of lead glass by George Ravenscroft around 1676, and the manufacture of slipware by Thomas Toft.\n\nAfter the accession of William III and Mary II in 1689, Restoration style was superseded by William and Mary style.\n\n"}

In 1755 he married Sukey, a daughter of the cabinetmaker Giles Grendey, and is said to have acquired a ‘singularly haughty character’, strutting ‘in full dress of the most superb and costly kind...through his workshops giving orders to his men’, and on one occasion earning a rebuke from George III. He worked with William Vile from 1750 until 1765 in premises at No, 72, the corner house of St Martin's Lane & Long Acre. In the early 1750s, William Hallett, another cabinetmaker of the time, formed a working syndicate with Vile & Cobb. Vile and Cobb supplied furniture to the leading patrons of the day including George III and Queen Charlotte, the 1st Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall, the 4th Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth and the 4th Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey.\n\nVile and Cobb held the Royal Warrant from 1761 until April 1764 when Vile retired. While Vile created works in an Anglicized Rococo style, Cobb’s furniture of the 1770s was executed in an elegant Neoclassical style. Cobb was well known for his haughty disposition which did not always endear him to his customers, so it was no surprise that the Royal Warrant was awarded to two of their employees William France and John Bradburne instead of Cobb himself. Some of Cobb's work is in the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace.\n\nFollowing Vile's retirement in 1764, Cobb carried on in business with the assistance of his foreman, Samuel Reynolds (fl 1751–85). He made furniture to very high standards and earned a reputation for exquisite marquetry: Hester Thrale, the writer and friend of Dr Johnson, compared the inlaid floors at Sceaux, France, to ‘the most high prized Cabinet which Mr Cobb can produce to captivate the Eyes of his Customers’. Inlay in tropical woods, particularly satinwood, was an important element of Neo-classical furniture. In 1772–4 Cobb produced an ‘Extra neat Inlaid Commode’ and two stands en suite for Paul Methuen at Corsham Court, Wilts, which survive in situ. In 1772 he was implicated in the smuggling of furniture from France. His most extensive work was for the 6th Earl of Coventry at Croome Court, Worcs, between 1765 and 1773. This included a large mahogany wardrobe and extensive seating in the new Neo-classical style. It is recorded that he received commissions for work at a number of other houses, including Burton Hall, Lincs, Uppark, W. Sussex, Audley End, Essex, and David Garrick’s villa at Hampton, Middx.\nFurniture was also supplied for Strawberry Hill, home of Horace Walpole from 1760 to 1771.\n\nAfter Cobb’s death in 1778, Samuel Reynolds operated in partnership with John Graham at Cobb’s address at 72 St Martin’s Lane, London, until 1785.\n\n\n"}

Ravel published an orchestral version in 1910 using two flutes, an oboe, two clarinets (in B), two bassoons, two horns, harp, and strings. The \"Pavane\" lasts between six and seven minutes and is considered a masterpiece.\n\nRavel described the piece as \"an evocation of a pavane that a little princess might, in former times, have danced at the Spanish court\". The pavane was a slow processional dance that enjoyed great popularity in the courts of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. \n\nThis antique miniature is not meant to pay tribute to any particular princess from history, but rather expresses a nostalgic enthusiasm for Spanish customs and sensibilities, which Ravel shared with many of his contemporaries (most notably Debussy and Albéniz) and which is evident in some of his other works such as the \"Rapsodie espagnole\" and the \"Boléro\".\n\nRavel dedicated the \"Pavane\" to his patron, the Princesse de Polignac, and he probably performed the work at the princess's home on several occasions. It was first published by Eugène Demets in 1900, but it attracted little attention until the Spanish pianist Ricardo Viñes gave the first performance on 5 April 1902. The work soon became very popular, although Ravel came to think of it as \"poor in form\" and unduly influenced by the music of Chabrier. \n\nRavel intended the piece to be played extremely slowly – more slowly than almost any modern interpretation, according to his biographer Benjamin Ivry. The critic Émile Vuillermoz complained that Ravel's playing of the work was \"unutterably slow\". However, the composer was not impressed by interpretations that plodded. After a performance by Charles Oulmont, Ravel mentioned to him that the piece was called \"Pavane for a dead princess\", not \"dead pavane for a princess\". When asked by the composer-conductor Manoah Leide-Tedesco how he arrived at the title \"Pavane pour une infante défunte\", Ravel smiled coyly and replied, \"Do not be surprised, that title has nothing to do with the composition. I simply liked the sound of those words and I put them there, \"c'est tout\"\". But Ravel also stated that the piece depicted a pavane as it would be danced by an infanta found in a painting by Diego Velázquez.\nWhen Ravel published his orchestrated version of the \"Pavane\" in 1910, he gave the lead melody to the horn, and specified a non-generic instrument: the score calls for \"2 Cors simples en sol\" (two hand-horns in G). The teaching of the valveless hand-horn had persisted longer in the Paris Conservatory than in other European centers; only in 1903 had the valve horn replaced it as the official horn of primary instruction. The orchestral score was published in 1910. The premiere was given on 27 February 1911 in Manchester, England, conducted by Sir Henry Wood. Reviewing the concert, the critic Samuel Langford called the work \"most beautiful\" and added, \"The piece is hardly representative of the composer, with whom elusive harmonies woven in rapid figuration are the usual medium of expression. In the \"Pavane\" we get normal, almost archaic harmonies, subdued expression, and a somewhat remote beauty of melody.\"\n\nThe first gramophone recording of the \"Pavane\" was made in 1921 in Paris. A later recording, made in Paris in 1932 is sometimes thought to have been conducted by the composer, but was actually conducted by Pedro de Freitas-Branco, under the supervision of Ravel, who was present at rehearsal and the recording session.\n\nRavel himself made a piano roll recording of the piece in 1922. (His performance is approximately five minutes and forty seconds in length.)\n\nIn addition to numerous recorded performances within the classical repertoire, the \"Pavane\" maintains a significant presence in popular music. In particular, the song \"The Lamp Is Low\" was adapted from it. More recently, the Pavane appears in dozens of popular albums under both French and English forms of its title. \nIt was recorded by Pedro Aznar on his eponymous album (1982), in which he made use of synthesizers instead of acoustic instruments. Some unusual interpretations include another electronic versions by William Orbit in \"Pieces in a Modern Style\" (2000), Isao Tomita (1979) and the all-female synthesizer quartet Hello, Wendy! (2014). Edgar Meyer recorded a version for double bass and piano on his CD \"Work in Progress\" (1990), a solo bass guitar version by Jimmy Earl (1995), Ali Aiman's minimalist/electronic adaptation in his Overture EP (2014) and Hayley Westenra's vocal adaptation \"Never Say Goodbye\", which appears in her album \"Pure\" (2004).\n\n\n"}

It was fought between the Irish Republican insurgents called the United Irishmen and British Crown forces composed of regular soldiers, militia and yeomanry. The attack on the town of New Ross on the River Barrow, was an attempt by the recently victorious rebels to break out of county Wexford across the river Barrow and to spread the rebellion into county Kilkenny and the outlying province of Munster.\n\nOn 4 June 1798, the rebels advanced from their camp on Carrigbyrne Hill to Corbet Hill, just outside New Ross town. The battle, the bloodiest of the 1798 rebellion, began at dawn on 5 June 1798 when the Crown garrison was attacked by a force of almost 10,000 rebels, massed in three columns outside the town. The attack had been expected since the fall of Wexford town to the rebels on 30 May and the British garrison of 2,000 had prepared defences both outside and inside the town. Trenches were dug and manned by skirmishers on the approaches to the town while cannon were stationed facing all the rapidly falling approaches and narrow streets of the town to counter the expected mass charges by the rebels, who were mainly armed with pikes.\n\nBagenal Harvey, the United Irish Leader recently released from captivity following the rebel seizure of Wexford town, attempted to negotiate surrender of New Ross but the rebel emissary Matt Furlong was shot down by Crown outposts while bearing flag of truce. His death provoked a furious charge by an advance guard of 500 insurgents led by John Kelly (of ballad fame) who had instructions to seize the Three Bullet Gate and wait for reinforcements before pushing into the town. To aid their attack, the rebels first drove a herd of cattle through the gate.\nAnother rebel column attacked the Priory Gate but the third pulled back from the Market Gate intimidated by the strong defences. Seizing the opportunity the garrison sent a force of cavalry out the Market Gate to attack and scatter the remaining two hostile columns from the flanks. However the rebel rump had not yet deployed and upon spotting the British manoeuvre, rallied the front ranks who stood and broke the cavalry charge with massed pikes.\n\nThe encouraged rebel army then swept past the Crown outposts and seized the Three Bullet Gate causing the garrison and populace to flee in panic. Without pausing for reinforcement, the rebels broke into the town attacking simultaneously down the steeply sloping streets but met with strong resistance from well-prepared second lines of defence of the well-armed soldiers. Despite horrific casualties the rebels managed to seize two-thirds of the town by using the cover of smoke from burning buildings and forced the near withdrawal of all Crown forces from the town. However, the rebels' limited supplies of gunpowder and ammunition forced them to rely on the pike and blunted their offensive. The military managed to hold on and following the arrival of reinforcements, launched a counterattack before noon which finally drove the exhausted rebels from the town.\n\nNo effort to pursue the withdrawing rebels was made but when the town had been secured, a massacre of prisoners, trapped rebels and civilians of both sympathies alike began which continued for days. Some hundreds were burned alive when rebel casualty stations were torched by victorious troops and more rebels are believed to have been killed in the aftermath of the battle than during the actual fighting. Reports of such atrocities brought by escaping rebels are believed to have influenced the retaliatory murder of over 100 loyalists in the flames of Scullabogue Barn.\n\nCasualties in the Battle of New Ross are estimated at 2,800 to 3,000 Rebels and 200 Garrison dead. An Augustinian Friar at New Ross on 5 June 1798, the day of the Battle, entered in the Augustinian Church \"Mass Book\" the following in Latin: \"\"Hodie hostis rebellis repulsa est ab obsidione oppidi cum magna caede, puta 3000\",\" (\"today, the rebel enemy was driven back from the assault of the town with great slaughter [carnage], estimated at 3000\"\".)\nA loyalist eye-witness account stated; \"\"The remaining part of the evening\" (of 5 June 1798) \"was spent in searching for and shooting the insurgents, whose loss in killed was estimated at two thousand, eight hundred and six men.\"\" This second figure is probably the most accurate of all figures given – it indicates that an attempt to make an accurate count had been made. Most of the dead Rebels were thrown in the River Barrow or buried in a mass grave outside the town walls, a few days after the Battle.\n\nThe remaining rebel army reorganised and formed a camp at Sliabh Coillte some five miles (8 km) to the east but never attempted to attack the town again. They later attacked General John Moore's invading column but were defeated at the battle of Foulksmills on 20 June 1798.\n\n\n"}

Its most important features are:\n\n\nThe project originated from a mailing list started in November 1997. Eventually Harald Milz wrote an odd sort of Linux-HA HOWTO. Unlike most HOWTOs, this was not about how to configure or use existing software, it was a collection of HA techniques which one could use if one were to write HA software for Linux.\n\nAlan Robertson was inspired by this description and thought that he could perhaps write some of the software for the project to act as a sort of initial seed crystal to help jump start the project. He got this initial software running on 18 March 1998. He created the first web site for the project on 19 October 1998, and the first version of the software was released on 15 November 1998. The first production customer of the software was Rudy Pawul of ISO-NE. The ISO-NE web site went into production in the second half of 1999.\n\nAt this point, the project was limited to two nodes and very simple takeover semantics, and no resource monitoring.\n\nThis was cured with version 2 of the software, which added n-node clusters, resource monitoring, dependencies, and policies. Version 2.0.0 came out on 29 July 2005. This release represented another important milestone as it was the first version where very large contributions (in terms of code size) were made by the Linux-HA community at large. This series of releases brought the project to a level of feature parity-or-superiority with respect to commercial HA software.\n\nAfter version 2.1.4, the cluster resource manager component (responsible for starting and stopping resources and monitoring resource and node failure) was split off into a separate project called Pacemaker, and the resource agents and other \"glue\" infrastructure were moved to separate packages. Thus with the version 3 series, the name \"Heartbeat\" should be used for the cluster messaging layer only.\n\n\n\n"}

The partition between the two parts of the container is then opened, and the gas fills the whole container.\n\nThe Joule expansion, treated as a thought experiment involving ideal gases, is a useful exercise in classical thermodynamics. It provides a convenient example for calculating changes in thermodynamic quantities, including the resulting increase in entropy of the universe (entropy production) that results from this inherently irreversible process. An actual Joule expansion experiment necessarily involves real gases; the temperature change in such a process provides a measure of intermolecular forces.\n\nThis type of expansion is named after James Prescott Joule who used this expansion, in 1845, in his study for the mechanical equivalent of heat, but this expansion was known long before Joule e.g. by John Leslie, in the beginning of the 19th century, and studied by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac in 1807 with similar results as obtained by Joule.\n\nThe Joule expansion should not be confused with the Joule-Thompson effect.\n\nThe process begins with gas under some pressure, formula_1, at temperature formula_2, confined to one half of a thermally isolated container (see the top part of the drawing at the beginning of this article). The gas occupies an initial volume formula_3,\nmechanically separated from the other part of the container, which has a volume formula_4, and is under near zero pressure. The tap (solid line) between the two halves of the container is then suddenly opened, and the gas expands to fill the entire container, which has a total volume of formula_5 (see the bottom part of the drawing). A thermometer inserted into the compartment on the left (not shown in the drawing) measures the temperature of the gas before and after the expansion. \n\nThe system in this experiment consists of both compartments; that is, the entire region occupied by the gas at the end of the experiment. Because this system is thermally isolated, it cannot exchange heat with its surroundings. Also, since the system's total volume is kept constant, the system cannot perform work on its surroundings. As a result, the change in internal energy,\nformula_6, is zero. Internal energy consists of internal kinetic energy (due to the motion of the molecules) and internal potential energy (due to intermolecular forces). When the molecular motion is random, temperature is the measure of the internal kinetic energy. In this case, the internal kinetic energy is called heat. If the chambers have not reached equilibrium, there will be some kinetic energy of flow, which is not detectable by a thermometer (and therefore is not a component of heat). Thus, a change in temperature indicates a change in kinetic energy, and some of this change will not appear as heat until and unless thermal equilibrium is reestablished. When heat is transferred into kinetic energy of flow, this causes a decrease in temperature. \nIn practice, the simple two-chamber free expansion experiment often incorporates a 'porous plug' through which the expanding air must flow to reach the lower pressure chamber. The purpose of this plug is to inhibit directional flow, thereby quickening the reestablishment of thermal equilibrium. \nSince the total internal energy does not change, the stagnation of flow in the receiving chamber converts kinetic energy of flow back into random motion (heat) so that the temperature climbs to its predicted value.\nIf the initial air temperature is low enough that non-ideal gas properties cause condensation, some internal energy is converted into latent heat (an offsetting change in potential energy) in the liquid products. Thus, at low temperatures the Joule expansion process provides information on intermolecular forces.\n\nIf the gas is ideal, both the initial (formula_2, formula_1, formula_3) and final (formula_10, formula_11, formula_12) conditions follow the Ideal Gas Law, so that initially\n\nand then, after the tap is opened,\n\nHere formula_15 is the number of moles of gas and formula_16 is the molar ideal gas constant. Because the internal energy does not change and the internal energy of an ideal gas is solely a function of temperature, the temperature of the gas does not change; therefore formula_17. This implies that\n\nTherefore if the volume doubles, the pressure halves.\n\nThe fact that the temperature does not change makes it easy to compute the change in entropy of the universe for this process. \n\nUnlike ideal gases, the temperature of a real gas will change during a Joule expansion. Empirically, it is found that almost all gases cool during a Joule expansion at all temperatures investigated; the exceptions are helium, at temperatures above about 40 K, and hydrogen, at temperatures above about 200 K. This temperature is known as the inversion temperature of the gas. Above this temperature gas heats up during Joule expansion. Since internal energy is constant, cooling must be due to the conversion of internal kinetic energy to internal potential energy, with the opposite being the case for warming.\n\nIntermolecular forces are repulsive at short range and attractive at long range (for example, see the Lennard-Jones potential). Since distances between gas molecules are large compared to molecular diameters, the energy of a gas is usually influenced mainly by the attractive part of the potential. As a result, expanding a gas usually increases the potential energy associated with intermolecular forces. Some textbooks say that for gases this must always be the case and that a Joule expansion must always produce cooling. In liquids, where molecules are close together, repulsive interactions are much more important and it is possible to get an increase in temperature during a Joule expansion.\n\nIt is theoretically predicted that, at sufficiently high temperature, all gases will warm during a Joule expansion The reason is that at any moment, a very small number of molecules will be undergoing collisions; for those few molecules, repulsive forces will dominate and the potential energy will be positive. As the temperature rises, both the frequency of collisions and the energy involved in the collisions increase, so the positive potential energy associated with collisions increases strongly. If the temperature is high enough, that can make the total potential energy positive, in spite of the much larger number of molecules experiencing weak attractive interactions. When the potential energy is positive, a constant energy expansion reduces potential energy and increases kinetic energy, resulting in an increase in temperature. This behavior has only been observed for hydrogen and helium; which have very weak attractive interactions. For other gases this \"Joule inversion temperature\" appears to be extremely high.\n\nEntropy is a function of state, and therefore the entropy change can be computed directly from the knowledge of the final and initial equilibrium states. For an ideal gas, the change in entropy is the same as for isothermal expansion where all heat is converted to work:\n\nFor an ideal monatomic gas, the entropy as a function of the internal energy \"U\", volume \"V\", and number of moles \"n\" is given by the Sackur–Tetrode equation:\n\nIn this expression \"m\" is the particle mass and \"h\" Planck's constant. For a monatomic ideal gas \"U\" = (3/2)\"nRT\" = \"nC\"\"T\", with \"C\" the molar heat capacity at constant volume. In terms of classical thermodynamics the entropy of an ideal gas is given by\n\nwhere \"S\" is the, arbitrary chosen, value of the entropy at volume \"V\" and temperature \"T\". It is seen that a doubling of the volume at constant \"U\" or \"T\" leads to an entropy increase of Δ\"S\" = \"nR\" ln(2). This result is also valid if the gas is not monatomic, as the volume dependence of the entropy is the same for all ideal gases.\n\nA second way to evaluate the entropy change is to choose a route from the initial state to the final state where all the intermediate states are in equilibrium. Such a route can only be realized in the limit where the changes happen infinitely slowly. Such routes are also referred to as quasistatic routes. In some books one demands that a quasistatic route has to be reversible, here we don't add this extra condition. The net entropy change from the initial state to the final state is independent of the particular choice of the quasistatic route, as the entropy is a function of state.\n\nHere is how we can effect the quasistatic route. Instead of letting the gas undergo a free expansion in which the volume is doubled, a free expansion is allowed in which the volume expands by a very small amount δ\"V\". After thermal equilibrium is reached, we then let the gas undergo another free expansion by δ\"V\" and wait until thermal equilibrium is reached. We repeat this until the volume has been doubled. In the limit δ\"V\" to zero, this becomes an ideal quasistatic process, albeit an irreversible one. Now, according to the fundamental thermodynamic relation, we have:\n\nAs this equation relates changes in thermodynamic state variables, it is valid for any quasistatic change, regardless of whether it is irreversible or reversible. For the above defined path we have that d\"U\" = 0 and thus \"T\"d\"S\"=\"P\"d\"V\", and hence the increase in entropy for the Joule expansion is\n\nA third way to compute the entropy change involves a route consisting of reversible adiabatic expansion followed by heating. We first let the system undergo a reversible adiabatic expansion in which the volume is doubled. During the expansion, the system performs work and the gas temperature goes down, so we have to supply heat to the system equal to the work performed to bring it to the same final state as in case of Joule expansion. \n\nDuring the reversible adiabatic expansion, we have d\"S\" = 0. From the classical expression for the entropy it can be derived that the temperature after the doubling of the volume at constant entropy is given as:\n\nfor the monatomic ideal gas. Heating the gas up to the initial temperature \"T\" increases the entropy by the amount\n\nWe might ask what the work would be if, once the Joule expansion has occurred, the gas is put back into the left-hand side by compressing it. The best method (i.e. the method involving the least work) is that of a reversible isothermal compression, which would take work \"W\" given by\n\nDuring the Joule expansion the surroundings do not change, so the entropy of the surroundings is constant. So the entropy change of the so-called \"universe\" is equal to the entropy change of the gas which is \"nR\" ln 2.\n\nJoule performed his experiment with air at room temperature which was expanded from a pressure of about 22 bar. Air, under these conditions, is almost an ideal gas, but not quite. As a result the real temperature change will not be exactly zero. With our present knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of air we can calculate that the temperature of the air should drop by about 3 degrees Celsius when the volume is doubled under adiabatic conditions. However, due to the low heat capacity of the air and the high heat capacity of the strong copper containers and the water of the calorimeter, the observed temperature drop is much smaller, so Joule found that the temperature change was zero within his measuring accuracy.\n\nThe majority of good undergraduate textbooks deal with this expansion in great depth; see e.g. \"Concepts in Thermal Physics\", Blundell & Blundell, OUP \n"}

It was designed as a profit making venture, independent of as much government control as possible, in an attempt to maneuver around some of the limitations of legislation governing public universities. It was the brainchild of former Vice-Chancellor Alan Gilbert. It also allowed the public university to operate a management model and mission more akin to private market-driven universities in the USA (like the University of Phoenix). MUP's main potential markets were businesspeople and students of languages and international development, both in Australia and overseas.\n\nA new area of buildings was built immediately south of the main University of Melbourne campus, and one was earmarked for MUP. Controversially, this development involved the removal of old terrace houses and a lawn bowls club. However the upset was placated somewhat by the restoration of other buildings and the creation of a new public square. Despite the strong efforts of its parent, MUP's early life was less than successful, and it was downgraded to operating from the Hawthorn Language Centre in a Melbourne suburb. The multimillion-dollar building in which MUP maintained a small office was soon taken over by the public university, and named the \"Alan Gilbert Building\".\n\nA major part of MUP's work was to produce curriculum for distance education courses to be delivered through the Universitas 21 (U21) platform, and latterly in its own right.\n\nThe distance education platform U21Global struggled to attract interest, and demand for its courses fell well below expectations. U21Global was ultimately sold to a private operator, with heavy losses.\n\nThe situation was made worse when the federal government changed its rules, allowing public universities to offer full fee paying courses to a broader range of people. This was also a time when more Australian universities started opening overseas campuses and otherwise delivering their courses offshore, as well as more actively bringing foreign students to Australia.\n\nMUP attracted the scrutiny of the Labor state government in 2001, but was subsequently re-accredited in 2003, with targets to increase research performance. However, its future dimmed when Alan Gilbert accepted a position at the University of Manchester in England in 2003. His successor, Glyn Davis, proved to be much more centrist, and was not fond of the private entity. John Cain, former Premier of Victoria, was one of MUP's most vocal critics, and his book Off Course pointed to shortcomings of MUP.\n\nOn June 7, 2005, only months into his term, Glyn Davis announced that Melbourne University Private would close. Some of it, including the School of Enterprise, was merged with the University of Melbourne and continues to function, but the Hawthorn English Language Centre remained a separate entity. Other parts, including the international projects arm, were sold. The Chief Executive officer, David Lloyd, resigned at the time of the press announcement. Alan Gilbert declined to comment on the decision of his successor.\n\nOver its eight-year life, the university lost A$20 million, although this is believed to be a conservative estimate given the pre-startup investment costs, which Cain and other critics put as high as A$150 million. At the announcement of its closure, the private university had 600 fee-paying students, a growing number but less than targeted (2500 were hoped to be enrolled in 2008).\n"}

Awarded the 1977 Rooney Prize for Irish Literature and 1980 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, his oeuvre comprises novels, plays, short stories and travel writing.\n\nThe \"Cork Examiner\" said: \"Like no other Irish writer just now, Hogan sets down what it's like to be a disturbed child of what seems a Godforsaken country in these troubled times.\" The \"Irish Independent\" said he is \"to be commended for the fidelity and affection he shows to the lonely and the downtrodden.\" \"The Boston Globe\" said there \"is something mannered in Hogan's prose, which is festooned with exotic imagery and scattered in sentence fragments.\"\n\nA contemporary of Bruce Chatwin, Ian McEwan, Peter Carey, Salman Rushdie and a close friend of Kazuo Ishiguro, he has since vanished off the literary scene. In October 2009, he was placed on the sexual offenders list.\n\nHogan was born in Ballinasloe in east County Galway. His father was a draper. Educated locally at St. Grellan's Boys' National School and St. Joseph's College, Garbally Park, some of his earliest work was published in \"The Fountain\", the Garbally college annual.\n\nAfter leaving school, Hogan travelled to France, ending up in Paris just after the student riots of 1968. He later studied at University College Dublin (UCD), where he received a BA in 1972 and an MA in 1973.\n\nIn 1971 he won the Hennessy Award. The Irish Writers' Co-operative, formed by writer Fred Johnston, Neil Jordan and playwright Peter Sheridan at a meeting in a Dublin restaurant, were to publish Hogan's \"The Ikon Maker\", which was also the Co-op's first publication. While in Dublin, he worked as a street actor and had a number of plays – \"A Short Walk to the Sea\", \"Sanctified Distances\", and \"The Squat\" – produced in the Abbey Theatre and the Project Arts Centre. RTÉ and BBC Radio broadcast some of his plays, including \"Jimmy\". He also published stories in small magazines such as \"Adam\" and the \"Transatlantic Review\".\n\nLater he moved to London, living in Tooting, Catford and Hounslow and then later as a lodger in the Hampstead home of Anthony Farrell, a young Irish publisher. Friends and acquaintances from this period included: writer Jaci Stephen, biographer Patrick Newley, Kazuo Ishiguro and his partner, Lorna. Hogan also participated in poetry and literature readings held at Bernard Stone's Turrett Bookshop on Floral Street in Covent Garden.\n\nHis debut novel, \"The Ikon-Maker\", was written in 1974 and published in 1976. It deals with a mother's unwilling recognition of her son's homosexuality.\n\nIn 1977, he was the recipient of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature, though this event remained undiscovered in America for several years until the \"Pittsburgh Press\" reported the revelation to its readers in 1981. In 1978, he participated in the Santa Cruz Writers Conference. In the early 1980s, Hogan was represented by Deborah Rogers' literary agency, which also had Peter Carey, Bruce Chatwin, Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie on its books. In 1980, he won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for his \"Diamonds at the Bottom of the Sea\" collection of short stories. In 1981, he appeared in Granta.\n\nIn 1989, Hogan left London and was a Hudson Strode Fellow at the University of Alabama. In 1991, Hogan was awarded a place on the DAAD (German Academic Exchange) Berlin Artists' Programme fellowship which enabled him to live in that city. It was in Berlin that he fell in love with Sammy, who has since died, with Hogan moving on to Prague, griefstricken, where he wrote his book \"Farewell to Prague\".\n\nHogan returned to Ireland in 1995, living in Clifden, County Galway. For a period, he lived in an old caravan in County Limerick along North Kerry/West Limerick border. In 1997, he lectured in short fiction at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nHe was a judge in the 2005 Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, worth €50,000.\n\nInterested in history, painting, traveller culture, he has used a typewriter since he was a child and finds the modern transition to computers difficult. Suspicious of the telephone, he prefers to communicate using postcards.\n\nHogan was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. The assault happened on 11 November 2006 in a house Hogan was renting. He was given a two-year suspended jail sentence, placed on the sex offenders register, and ordered not to have unsupervised contact with children. The judge, Carroll Moran, made the judgement that Hogan had a \"moderate to low\" level chance of re-offending. However, Hogan's parole officer, Nora Brassil, stated in an earlier hearing that Hogan saw the assault as \"a mutual sexual incident/ relationship\". She was concerned that if Hogan did not see what he had done as wrong, he might re-offend.\n\n\nHogan features in a number of major anthologies of modern Irish literature.\n\nWilliam Trevor included him in \"The Oxford Book of Irish Stories\" and Colm Tóibín selected his story \"Winter Swimmers\" for \"The Penguin Book of Irish Writing\".\n\nHe appears in \"The Anchor Book of New Irish Writing\".\n\nHe appears in the anthology \"Best European Fiction 2012\", edited by Aleksandar Hemon, with a preface by Nicole Krauss (Dalkey Archive Press).\n\nAnother Irish writer Colum McCann, claims that Hogan, along with Benedict Kiely, is one of two Irish writers who have influenced him greatly.\n\nJoyce Carol Oates, an American writer, much admires his story \"Winter Swimmers\".\n\nAccording to Robert McCrum, former Literary Editor of \"The Observer\", Hogan is \"one of Ireland's finest writers\".\n\n\nThe Ikon Maker\nThe Leaves on Grey\nA Curious Street\nA New Shirt\nA Farewell to Prague\n\nDiamonds at the Bottom of the Sea and Other Stories\nChildren of Lir: Stories from Ireland\nStories: the Diamonds at the Bottom of the Sea, Children of Lir\n\"The Mourning Thief and Other Stories\nLebanon Lodge\nA Link With the River.

Grant during and after the war, he was President Grant's private secretary at the White House, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds for Washington D.C., and a Florida-based federal inspector of lighthouses. Babcock continued to serve as lighthouse inspector under Grant's successors Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A Arthur.\n\nA native of Vermont, Babcock graduated third in his class at West Point in 1861, and served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers throughout the Civil War. As Assistant Engineer and aide-de-camp for district commander Nathaniel P. Banks, in 1862 Babcock worked on fortifications to aid in defending the nation's capitol from Confederate attack. Babcock later served as aide-de-camp for Ulysses S. Grant and participated in the Overland Campaign. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general in 1865 and continued on Grant's staff during Reconstruction. In 1867, Babcock warned Grant of a white supremacist insurgency that used Confederate symbolism to intimidate blacks in the South.\n\nAfter Grant became President in 1869, Babcock was assigned Grant's Secretary to the President of the United States—in modern terms, the chief of staff—and he served until his departure from the White House in 1876. Young and ambitious, critics considered Babcock the Iago of the Grant administration. \nHe remained on the Army rolls during his service in the White House, which limited the ability of Congress to oversee or influence his activities. This circumstance became an issue when he was accused of crimes while in office. In addition to his position in the White House, Grant appointed Babcock Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds for Washington, DC. In 1869, Grant sent him on a mission to explore the possibility of annexing the island nation of Santo Domingo to the United States, but the Senate, led by Charles Sumner, rejected the proposal.\n\nBabcock's tenure under Grant was controversial. He was criminally indicted twice over corruption charges. Grant shielded Babcock from political attack out of a loyalty bond that stemmed primarily from their shared battle experiences during the Civil War. After Babcock was indicted as a member of the Whiskey Ring in 1875, Grant provided a written deposition on Babcock's behalf—a first for a sitting president—which was admitted at Babcock's 1876 trial, and resulted in his acquittal. Upon his return from St. Louis, Grant gave in to pressure from Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and forced Babcock to leave the White House. A second indictment, in 1876, over the Safe Burglary Conspiracy, ended in an acquittal, but further alienated Babcock from Republicans who favored government reform, while public opinion turned against him.\n\nDespite dismissing him from the White House, Grant did not desert his wartime comrade; in February 1877, he appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's Fifth District, a low-profile post that did not attract undue public attention. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur additionally appointed Babcock as Inspector of Lighthouses for the Sixth District. Babcock was the chief engineer overseeing plans for the construction of the Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse. He died on duty in 1884 when he drowned off Mosquito Inlet in Daytona Beach, Florida. Babcock's historical reputation is mixed; his technical engineering expertise, efficiency, bravery in battle, and Union loyalty were offset by his involvement in corruption, deception, and scandal. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Babcock also held no racial animosity, which played a part in his advocacy of Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo.\n\nOrville E. Babcock was born on December 25, 1835 in Franklin, Vermont, a small town located near the Canada–US border close to Lake Champlain. Babcock's father was Elias Babcock Jr. and his mother was Clara Olmsted. While growing up, he received a common education in the schools of Berkshire, Vermont. At the age of 16, Babcock was appointed to the West Point Military Academy (USMA), where he graduated third in a class of 45 on May 6, 1861. His high class ranking enabled Babcock to select his branch, and he chose the Engineers, as did most top graduates of his era.\n\nThe American Civil War was beginning as Babcock was graduating; he was commissioned as a Brevet Second Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, and assigned to duty as an Assistant Engineer for the military district that included Washington. His first mission was the undertaking of efforts to improve the defensive works of Washington, D.C. and protect the city from attack. On July 13, 1861, Babcock was assigned to the Department of Pennsylvania. In August, he received his commission as a second lieutenant, to date from his West Point graduation in May; he was assigned to the Department of the Shenandoah, and constructed military fortifications on the Potomac River and in the Shenandoah Valley while also serving as aide-de-camp under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks. From August through November, Babcock worked again on improving the fortifications surrounding Washington, responding to increased apprehension the Union capital was vulnerable to attack and capture by the Confederate Army.\n\nOn November 17, 1861, Babcock was promoted to First Lieutenant, Corps of Engineers, and a week later was assigned to the Army of the Potomac. During the months of February and March, 1862, while General Banks moved to Winchester, Virginia, Babcock set up military fortifications at Harper's Ferry and guarded pontoon bridges crossing the Potomac River. During the Peninsula Campaign, Babcock served bravely at the Siege of Yorktown with the Army of the Potomac's Engineer Battalion and was brevetted as a captain to rank from May 4, 1862. For the next seven months, Babcock built bridges, roads, and field works. For his service, in November, 1862, Babcock was promoted to Chief Engineer of the Left Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac.\n\nIn December 1862, during the Battle of Fredericksburg, Babcock served on Brigadier General William B. Franklin's engineering staff.\n\nOn January 1, 1863, Babcock was promoted to permanent captain and brevet lieutenant colonel, and was named the Assistant Inspector General of the VI Corps until February 6, when he was named the Assistant Inspector General and Chief Engineer of the IX Corps. As Chief Engineer of the IX Corps, Babcock surveyed and projected the defensive fortifications at Louisville and Central Kentucky. Moving westward to help secure the Mississippi River from Confederate control and divide the Confederacy in two, Babcock fought with the IX Corps at the Battle of Vicksburg and the Battle of Blue Springs, and the Battle of Campbell's Station.\n\nBabcock was part of XXIII Corps, and served under Union engineer Captain Orlando M. Poe. Poe and Union engineers, that included Babcock, built several fortifications in the form of bastioned earthworks near Knoxville. One was Fort Sanders, just west of downtown Knoxville across a creek valley. It was named for Brig. Gen. William P. Sanders, mortally wounded in a skirmish outside Knoxville on November 18, 1863. The fort, had an innovative design, and was a salient in the line of earthworks that surrounded three sides of the city, rose above the surrounding plateau and was protected by a ditch wide and deep. An almost insurmountable vertical wall rose above the ditch, slippery and frozen. Inside the fort were 12 cannons and 440 men of the 79th New York Infantry. In front of the ditch, telegraph wires were strung at knee height across tree stumps, possibly the first use of such wire entanglements in the Civil War, to entangle Confederate soldiers that would assault the Fort.\n\nThe Battle of Fort Sanders was brutal by 19th Century standards. The Confederates moved to within 120-150 yards of the salient during the night of freezing rain and snow and waited for the order to attack. Entangled by the telegraph wire, Confederate soldiers were shot by Union soldiers atop the wall. After crossing the ditch, the Confederates were unable to dig footholds, men climbed upon each other's shoulders to attempt to reach the top of the wall. Union soldiers rained fire into the assault, including musketry, canister, and artillery shells thrown as hand grenades. A succession of color bearers was shot down as they planted their flags on the fort. For a brief time, three flags reached the top, those of the 16th Georgia, 13th Mississippi, and 17th Mississippi. After 40 minutes of battle, the Confederates broke and retreated. The battle ended in a lopsided Union victory.\n\nAfter fighting in the Knoxville Campaign, at the Battle of Fort Sanders, Babcock became the Chief Engineer of the Department of the Ohio and was promoted to brevet major on November 29, 1863.\n\nBabcock was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army on March 29, 1864 and became the aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant participating in Overland Campaign against General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Babcock served in the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Battle of Cold Harbor.\nFor his gallant service at the Battle of the Wilderness, Babcock was appointed brevet lieutenant colonel, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from May 6, 1864. On August 9, 1864, Babcock, while stationed at Union headquarters in City Point, was wounded in the hand after Confederate spies had blown up an ammunition barge moored below the city's bluffs. As Grant's aide-de-camp, Babcock ran dispatches between Grant and Major General William T. Sherman during Sherman's March to the Sea campaign.\n\nOn April 9, 1865 after being defeated at the Battle of Appomattox, Commanding Confederate General Robert E. Lee formally surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to Ulysses S. Grant. Babcock personally chose the site of surrender at the McLean House, personally escorted Lee to the meeting, and witnessed Grant and Lee discussing and signing the surrender terms.\n\nFor his meritorious contributions in the Civil War, Babcock was appointed brevet colonel, to rank from March 13, 1865. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Babcock for brevet brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.\n\nAfter the War, Babcock remained on Grant's staff throughout America's turbulent Reconstruction Period. On July 25, 1866, Babcock was commissioned colonel of volunteers and aide-de-camp for the General-in-Chief of the Army, Ulysses S. Grant. On March 21, 1867 Babcock received a Regular Army commission as a major in the Corps of Engineers.\n\nOn November 6, 1866, Babcock married Anne Eliza Cambell in Galena, Illinois. Their marriage produced four children: Campbell E. Babcock, Orville E. Babcock, Jr., Adolph B. Babcock, and Benjamin Babcock. Benjamin died during infancy. Babcock moved to Washington D.C. to serve as Grant's military aide, and remained to serve in the White House after Grant became president.\n\nIn mid-April, Grant dispatched Babcock and Horace Porter, another member of his staff, to report on the progress of Southern Reconstruction. Babcock and Porter were optimistic on the plight of blacks who had embraced citizenship saying the \"negro is learning very fast. They will soon be the best educated \"class\" in the South, if they continue at their present rate of progress.\" However, Babcock discovered and informed Grant of a white supremacist insurgency using Confederate symbolism that was developing to intimidate African Americans, saying that in Georgia the \"police in most of the cities are in a grey uniform, the real \"confederate\" uniform.\"\n\nIn 1868, Ulysses S. Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States. In 1869, the 33 year old Babcock was militarily assigned, rather than publicly appointed, Grant's personal secretary. Grant also had three other personal secretaries, Frederick Dent (Grant's brother in law), Horace Porter, and Robert M. Douglas. As one of a few men who had daily access to Grant in the White House, and one who had been close to Grant during the war, Babcock had unprecedented power and influence, entrusted by Grant, which extended directly and indirectly into many agencies and departments. His influence was so great that when cabinet positions and other appointments became available, Grant often acted on Babcock's recommendations. Suspected of using that influence for his own ends, Babcock was often at odds with reformers and opponents of corruption, including Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, who both desired to save Grant's and administration and reputation from scandal. While Grant admired Babcock for his Civil War service, Babcock's relative youth and ambitious nature led Grant's critics to consider him the Iago of the Grant administration.\n\nWhile serving in the White House, Babcock retained his position in the U.S. Army, an arrangement made between Grant and his successor as head of the Army, William T. Sherman. Babcock did not require Senate confirmation for his appointment and retained his military salary, which made it difficult for Congress to exercise oversight when Babcock became the subject of controversy and scandal. Babcock's duties included involvement in patronage matters, finding negative information on critics of the Grant administration, and feeding political stories to pro-Grant newspapers.\n\nBabcock's White House office was in a second floor anteroom that led to President Grant's private office. In order to see Grant, visitors had to go through Babcock, a circumstance that caused many to resent Babcock's insider role, and created a negative perception among contemporaries that overrode Babcock's positive attributes. Babcock also opened and answered most of Grant's personal letters, and historian Allan Nevins argued that Babcock's position was as at least as important as the Cabinet secretaries, and more powerful than most.\n\nIn 1869 Babcock was Grant's special agent in an attempt to annex the mostly mixed race and black, Spanish-speaking Caribbean island country of the Dominican Republic (\"18,655 mi²\"), then commonly called \"Santo Domingo\". At this time, federal land speculation was not uncommon, as Congress had in March 1867 purchased Alaska (\"663,300 mi²\") from the Russian Empire. Like his predecessor Andrew Johnson, Grant received inducements from speculators interested in Caribbean expansion, particularly for Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Speculators William L. Cazneau and Joseph W. Fabens formed the \"Santo Domingo Company\" in New York to attract financial supporters for annexing the Dominican Republic. Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, was doubtful concerning Haitian annexation, believing the country was politically unstable, and became suspicious when Fabens asked him to support a plan of American annexation of the Dominican Republic. Grant desired to investigate the island and find out whether the people wanted annexation. After two other candidates were excluded, Grant and Fish agreed to send Babcock on a secret reconnaissance mission to the Dominican Republic.\n\nBabcock had minimal qualifications for the job; he was not fluent in Spanish and did not have extensive knowledge of the West Indies. Babcock's official instructions, signed by Fish, were to gather knowledge of the people and the culture. In addition, he was to investigate the nation's agriculture and mineral wealth, as well as determine whether the government was stable and whether the people desired annexation. He was also instructed to find out about the country's economy, including the interest rate on the national debt and the strength of the Dominican currency. Grant also gave Babcock verbal orders to find out the terms by which the Dominican government would accept annexation, although Fish did not authorize Babcock to formally negotiate an agreement.\n\nBabcock boarded the steamship \"Tybee\" in New York and departed for the Dominican Republic on July 17, 1869. He was accompanied by Fabens and annexation supporter California Republican Senator Cornelius Cole. On the voyage the \"Tybee\" stopped at Samaná Bay and observed there was a \"splendid coal station\" on an island. The indigenous people were upset over a recent raid by the rebel warship \"Telégrafo\". Noting the soil to be fertile, Babcock believed the Dominican Republic could feed 4 million people. Babcock, however, said the people of the Dominican Republic were \"indolent and ignorant.\" Babcock's view, however, of the mixed race black people, did not impede his vision of Santo Domingo's inclusion by the United States. Babcock was a Reconstruction man, who was \"nicely color-blind\" to opportunism, in the post Civil War world.\n\nBabcock's next visited Santo Domingo City, but found that President Buenaventura Báez was not there. Babcock was entertained by Cazneau and his wife at their plantation house. After his stay in Santo Domingo City, Babcock reboarded the \"Tybee\" and voyaged to Azua, 60 miles away, where President Báez was staying. Babcock recorded that Báez was in favor of friendly relations with the United States. Nothing, however, was talked about annexation, until Babcock and Báez returned to Santo Domingo City.\n\nWithout any diplomatic authorization, Babcock entered negotiations with Báez for annexation on August 7, with Cazneau serving as Babcock's interpreter. Babcock was informed of a large loan with unfavorable terms that the Dominican government had taken from financier Edward Herzberg Hartmont. With annexation, the United States would be burdened by this loan, meaning this debt could hinder ratification in the Senate. Babcock believed the loan was a backhanded way by the British to take over the Dominican Gulf, presuming the Dominican government failed to pay it back. Babcock and Báez began significant negotiations in the second week of August, and asked Cazneau and Fabens for assistance. Babcock told Báez he was a representative of President Grant, and he was called to Dominican Republic to discuss a union of the two republics. Báez said he believed annexation would stabilize his country that he believed had gone backwards and asked Babcock to draw up a written plan for annexation.\n\nBy September 1869, Babcock and Cazneau drew up plans for annexation and submitted them to Báez, who generally approved. According to the drafts, Samaná Bay would be sold to the United States for $2 million or the whole country would be annexed to the United States after the U.S. paid off the Dominican Republic's national debt of $1.5 million. Báez told Babcock that before returning to Santo Domingo with a formal treaty, he should be assured by a sufficient number of Senators that they would ratify it. Babcock replied that President Grant, \"would not enter into any treaty without weighing the matter well, and feeling assured that it would be approved.\" Babcock was a supporter of Congressional Reconstruction, and he saw Santo Domingo, not as a nation of blacks, but as a source of new opportunities in a post war world. Babcock asked Báez to put in writing an annexation proposal he could transmit to Grant. After Báez agreed to do so, Gautier prepared a formal memorandum to be sent back to Washington.\n\nWhen Babcock returned to the White House with a draft a treaty, Fish and Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox were alarmed, since Babcock had no official standing. Fish told Cox \"Babcock is back...I pledge you my word he had no more diplomatic authority than any other casual visitor to the island.\" At the next cabinet meeting Babcock was there in person and Grant told his silenced cabinet that Babcock was back and that he (Grant) approved of the treaty. Cox spoke up and said, \"But Mr. President, has it been settled, then, that we \"want\" to annex Santo Domingo ?\" Grant was embarrassed and began puffing on his cigar, while the other cabinet members said nothing, Cox's question remained unanswered. Fish threatened to resign over the matter, but Grant convinced him to stay on the administration, telling Fish he would not go around him again and he needed Fish's guidance and support. Fish agreed to remain on the cabinet, although he hoped Grant would drop the Santo Domingo annexation treaty.\n\nGrant did not drop the treaty, believing annexation would help alleviate violent suppression of African Americans in the Southern states by providing in Santo Domingo a place where they could live and work undisturbed. Fish sent Babcock back to the Dominican Republic on November 18, accompanied by Major General Rufus Ingalls, a high-ranking Quartermaster officer. This time, Babcock had official State Department status and instructions to draw up two formal treaties, which were signed on November 29, 1869. Grant, however, kept the treaties secret from Congress and the public, until mid-January 1870. After earnest public discussion, the treaties was formerly submitted to Congress in March, whereupon Senators joined in the debate.\n\nSenator Charles Sumner strongly opposed the annexation treaties objecting to Babcock's secret negotiations, his use of naval power, and desiring to keep Santo Domingo an autonomous African American nation rather than annexation and potential statehood as Grant had proposed. The people of Santo Domingo overwhelmingly desired annexation voting 15,169 to 11 in its favor, according to a plebiscite held by Báez. Senate Republicans led by Sumner split the party over the treaty while Senators loyal to Grant supported the treaty and admonished Babcock. The treaties however failed to pass the Senate causing continued bitterness and hostility between Grant and Sumner, both stubbornly trying to control the Republican Party. Although Babcock was suspected of being given investment land on Samaná Bay, a Congressional investigation found no conclusive evidence that Babcock would financially gain from the country's annexation. Babcock in the minority report was criticized for acquiescing in the imprisonment of Davis Hatch, an American abroad, who was an open critic of Báez.\n\nIn 1869, Babcock invested money in Jay Cooke & Company's Gold Ring, a scam by wealthy New York tycoons Jay Gould and James Fisk to profit by cornering the market on gold. Starting in late April, Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell had regulated the price of gold by monthly sales from the Treasury in exchange for greenbacks. As part of the Gold Ring's effort, Gould convinced Grant not to increase the Treasury's September gold sale, helping make it scarce and inflating the price. Gould and Fisk then set up a buying operation, the New York Gold Room, where traders in their employ purchased as much gold as they could acquire, which artificially drove up the price. When Grant became aware of the full extent of the attempt to corner the market in late September 1869, he ordered the release of $4,500,000 in Treasury gold, which caused the price to collapse. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, but at the expense of a decline in the stock market and the overall economy. Babcock and other individuals who secretly invested with him lost $40,000 (about $750,000 in 2018). To satisfy his creditors, Babcock had to sign a trust deed on his property, which named Asa Bird Gardiner as trustee. The extent of Babcock's involvement was not revealed to Grant until 1876, when his complicity in the Gold Ring was uncovered during the investigation of his involvement in the Whiskey Ring.\n\nDating back to the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln it was common for distillers and corrupt Internal Revenue agents to make false whiskey production reports and pocket unpaid tax revenue. However, during the early 1870s, the corruption became more organized by distillers, who used the illegally obtained money for bribery and illegal election financing, to the point where every agent in St. Louis was involved in corruption. This organized network, known as the Whiskey Ring, extended nationally and involved \"the printing, selling, and approving of forged federal revenue stamps on bottled whiskey.\"\n\nIn June 1874, President Grant appointed Benjamin Bristow as Secretary of Treasury, with authority to investigate the Whiskey Ring and prosecute wrongdoers. Bristow, a Kentuckian and Union Army veteran, was known for his honesty and integrity, and had served as the nation's first Solicitor General, also appointed by Grant. Bristow immediately discovered whiskey tax evasion among distillers and corrupt officials in the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Bureau. Bristow and Bluford Wilson, the Treasury Solicitor obtained Grant's permission to use secret agents appointed from outside the Treasury Department; as a result of the evidence they obtained, on May 10, 1875 Treasury Department agents raided and shut down corrupt distilleries in St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, seizing company financial records and other files.\n\nBristow then prosecuted the offenders by working with Grant's newly appointed Attorney General, Edwards Pierrepont, a popular New York reformer who had been involved in shutting down New York City's corrupt Tweed Ring. Information was soon discovered that Babcock was informing ring leader John McDonald in St. Louis of inspections by Bristow's agents, giving them time to hide incriminating evidence before agents arrived. Bristow believed Babcock received cash in exchange for this information, in one instance two five-hundred-dollar bills hidden inside a cigar box. McDonald was indicted in June, when Bristow obtained indictments against 350 distillers and government officials.\n\nIn July 1875, Bristow and Pierrepont met Grant, who was vacationing at Long Branch, and gave him evidence that Babcock was a member of the ring. Grant told Pierrepont \"Let no guilty man escape...\" and said if Babcock was guilty then it was the \"greatest piece of traitorism to me that a man could possibly practice.\" In October, Babcock was summoned in front of Grant, Bristow, and Pierrepont at the White House to explain two ambiguous telegrams hand written by Babcock and signed \"Sylph\", an apparent code name for Babcock. The first message said, \"\"I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.\"\" (December 10, 1874) and the second one said, \"\"We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.\"\" (February 3, 1875) Bristow had shown these messages to Grant at a cabinet meeting the same day. Babcock said something to Grant, unintelligible to Bristow and Pierrepont, and Grant appeared satisfied by Babcock's interpretation of the telegrams.\n\nPierrepont and Bristow, believing the matter to be crucial, insisted Babcock send a message to his telegraphic correspondent demanding that this individual come to Washington to give his version of the messages. After Babcock seemed to be taking too long, Pierrepont went to check on him and found Babcock writing a warning to revenue agent John A. Joyce, his St. Louis confederate, to be on his guard. Infuriated, Pierrepont grabbed Babcock's pen and dashed through his message yelling \"You don't want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. \"I\" do not understand it.\" Grant, on the other hand, was divided between the loyalty he had for Babcock, and his desire for Bristow and Pierrepont, trustworthy members of his cabinet, to prosecute the Whiskey Ring. Since Babcock had no acceptable explanation for his messages, he was indicted for tax fraud on November 4, 1875.\n\nAs an Army officer, on December 2, 1875 Babcock requested of Grant a court-martial, believing that a military tribunal would be favorable to his defense. Grant agreed, and saw to it that a pro-Babcock panel was appointed, including Asa Bird Gardiner, who had a clear conflict of interest based on his business dealings with Babcock. Panel member Winfield Scott Hancock pointed out that Babcock was facing identical charges in federal court, and persuaded the court-martial to yield to civilian authorities. On December 8, 1875, U.S. Attorney David Dyer followed Bristow's instructions and set Babcock's St. Louis jury trial for February, 1876. When Babcock's trial date came up, Grant decided to testify in Babcock's defense. By this time, Grant said his critics were using Babcock to go after his own presidency. After cabinet members objected to Grant testifying in St. Louis as unseemly for a President, it was settled that Grant would give a deposition at the White House.\n\nOn February 8, 1876 Babcock went on trial, an event that lasted eighteen days. Babcock's defense team was noted for its prowess, and included Grant's former Attorney General George Williams, a top criminal defense lawyer, Emory Storrs, and a former appeals judge (New York), John K. Porter. It took place at the U.S. Post Office and Custom House located at 218 North Third Street, and the status of the defendant made the trial a popular and well-attended spectacle. Demand to attend the proceedings was so great that only persons with signed passes and Whiskey Ring defendants were allowed in. Babcock arrived in civilian clothes, including sky-blue pants, a silk hat, and a light jacket. When court was not in session, Babcock stayed at the newly rebuilt Lindell Hotel on Sixth Street and Washington Avenue.\n\nGrant's White House deposition took place on February 12; it was notarized by Chief Justice Morrison Waite and witnessed by both Bristow and Pierrepont. In his statement, Grant fully supported the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, but willfully refused to testify against Babcock, despite having been informed by Bristow of Babcock's duplicity. Instead, Grant praised Babcock, saying he had \"great confidence\" in Babcock's integrity, and that his confidence in Babcock was \"unshaken\".\n\nOn February 17, Babcock's defense counsel read President Grant's deposition to the jury, which severely weakened any chance of Babcock being convicted. The same day, General William T. Sherman testified that Babcock's \"character has been very good.\" Grant's deposition, Sherman's in-person testimony, and the evidence presented by Babcock's shrewd defense counsel led to his acquittal on February 25. A rumor spread that Pierrepont had leaked information to Babcock that aided in his acquittal, but Pierrepont denied this and suggested that Babcock himself had started the rumor. A few months later Grant's appointed anti-corruption team broke up. Pierrepont resigned office on May 21, 1876 and was appointed by Grant United States Minister to the United Kingdom on July 11, 1876. Enmity between Grant and Bristow forced Bristow out of the cabinet, and he resigned on June 20, 1876.\n\nWhen Babcock returned to Washington, he went back to his White House office, as if there had been no trial. Grant's Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, was furious, and pressured Grant to force Babcock to leave, saying that Grant merely had to dismiss Babcock, because as a military officer Babcock was subject to orders and had no recourse. Additionally, Treasury Solicitor Wilson informed Grant that Babcock had been involved with the 1869 plot to corner the gold market. Grant finally dismissed Babcock from the White House and appointed his son Ulysses Jr. in Babcock's place. It was later discovered that Babcock used his Whiskey Ring kickbacks to purchase from Henry Shelton Sanford on Christmas Day, 1874 a home and over 50 acres of grove land near what became the city of Sanford, Florida.\n\nFrom March 3, 1873 to March 3, 1877 Babcock served as Washington's Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, a Grant appointment he carried out in addition to serving as Grant's secretary. In this role, Babcock was involved in the beautification of the federal city and improvements to its infrastructure, but was also tied to allegations of corruption. The city's territorial governor, Alexander Robey Shepherd, a Grant appointee, operated aggressively when awarding contracts, and Babcock and Shepherd were accused of personally profiting from construction projects within the city limits. Babcock's supervision included construction of the Chain Bridge over the Potomac River and the Anacostia Railroad Bridge. He also supervised the construction of the east wing of the new State, War and Navy Building. Babcock retained the Superintendent's position after he was dismissed from the White House in 1876, and served until the Grant administration ended.\n\nOn April 15, 1876, fifty-one days after his acquittal in the Whiskey Ring trial, Babcock was indicted again, this time for involvement in the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. In 1874, Richard Harrington, an Assistant United States Attorney for Washington, DC attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, leader of the Memorialists, a reform organization critical of Shepherd's management of the city. Harrington hired dishonest Secret Service agents to break into the U.S. Attorney's safe, using explosives to make it obvious that a burglary had occurred. To entrap Alexander, the conspirators took materials that were supposedly stolen from the safe to his home at night, intending to give them to him and then later arrest him for their possession. Alexander thwarted this effort by refusing to answer the door. At that point, the Secret Service agents arrested two other conspirators who pretended to be the supposed burglars, and had them sign false affidavits implicating Alexander in the burglary. The conspiracy collapsed when the Secret Service agents admitted at Alexander's trial that the charges were false, and Alexander was acquitted. The conspiracy was alleged to have included Babcock as the liaison between Harrington and the Secret Service agents because Babcock wanted to silence Alexander, a prominent Grant administration critic. Babcock was exonerated of direct involvement. However, his continued ties to scandal and corruption turned public opinion against him, while he was viewed as a foe of Washington D.C. reform.\n\nOn February 27, 1877 Grant appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses of the Fifth District, a low-profile position that enabled Babcock to earn a living by making use of his engineering skills without drawing undue public attention to himself. Babcock continued to serve under Grant and his successors Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A. Arthur. On August 24, 1882, Arthur appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Sixth District, an appointment he carried out in addition to his Fifth District responsibilities.\nIn September 1879, Grant returned from his famous world tour. His popularity was as great as ever and Stalwart Republicans proposed to nominate him for a third term as president. Democrats sought to discredit his previous administration, including his cabinet and political appointees. Although Babock had been out of the political limelight for several years, his reputation was still marred because of his past involvement in corruption. On February 4, 1880, a color illustration by artist Joseph Keppler appeared in \"Puck\" magazine, in which Keppler ridiculed Grant and his associates, including Babcock, for having run a corrupt administration.\n\nOn May 14, 1880, Democratic Senator William W. Eaton of Connecticut read a memorial from Davis Hatch, who had been arrested in Santo Domingo in 1868 and was requesting reimbursement for the financial losses he said resulted from his imprisonment. According to Hatch, he was jailed on false charges and was going to be released, but Babcock, who was on the island in 1869 during negotiations for the proposed annexation treaty, interfered with Hatch's release and was complicit in Hatch being sentenced to a five-month prison term. Republican Senator Roscoe Conkling defended Babcock, saying that the Senate investigating committee's 1870 majority report fully exonerated him and that Eaton raised the issue only to try giving Democrats an advantage in an election year.\n\nIn June 1880, the Republicans held their national convention in Chicago. Grant was nominated by Conkling, his main Stalwart supporter. Republicans deadlocked between Grant and the other frontrunners, James G. Blaine and John Sherman. They eventually selected the dark horse candidate James A. Garfield as their candidate, effectively ending Grant's political career. Garfield went on to win the general election by defeating the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock.\n\nThe Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse project started in 1883, and Babcock was the supervising engineer. On June 2, 1884, Babcock and his associates were on duty and were aboard the government schooner \"Pharos\" to deliver construction supplies when they became anxious to return to land because a sudden storm created hazardous ocean conditions. The captain decided not to cross over the inlet bar during the storm because the construction supplies weighed down the ship, and he feared grounding it. As the storm worsened, Captain Newins of the nearby \"Bonito\" led seven men in a rowboat to the \"Pharos\" in order to retrieve the passengers. In debating whether to wait out the storm on the \"Pharos\" or try to make land, Babcock told his associates that since Newins and his crew had rowed safely to the \"Pharos\", they should be able to row to shore on tidal floods created by the storm.\n\nAfter eating their lunch on the \"Pharos\", Babcock and his associates boarded a rowboat and started for the shore. As they approached the inlet bar, swells capsized the boat several times, and it took on water. Babcock was thrown clear, but another person on the boat attached him to it by a lifeline. The boat and crew were battered by waves, oars, and other debris, and Babcock's lifeline was torn loose from the boat, which resulted in his drowning death. Upon reaching the shore, others who had been in the boat recovered Babcock's body and unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate him. Three others, including two of Babcock's associates, were also killed; the bodies of Babcock's associates, Levi P. Luckey and Benjamin F. Sutter, were recovered several days later, but the body of the fourth victim, a member of the boat's crew, was not found. The lighthouse construction project continued after Babcock's death, and was completed in 1887.\n\nScholars note Babcock's high class standing at West Point, engineering skills, and bravery during the American Civil War. Babcock also has been noted positively for his association with the antislavery views of the Radical Republicans. Historians also make positive mention of Babcock's post-White House career, noting that he served for eight years as a government lighthouse inspector and engineer, and did so capably and honestly.\n\nHowever, historians are critical of Babcock's political power as Grant's White House military aide, shielded by Grant, and not subject to resignation. Historians are also highly suspicious of Babcock's unauthorized Santo Domingo annexation pre-agreement. His reputation was also marred by his involvement in the Gold Ring, the Whiskey Ring, and the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. Most historians agree that Babcock betrayed Grant while President, and remain perplexed at Grant's loyalty to his wartime comrade, including Grant's unprecedented White House deposition on Babcock's behalf. In defending Babcock, Grant was not fully candid with the truth in his own testimony, probably to protect his family and his presidency from further scandal. With Babcock's reputation largely narrowed to observations about his corruption, loyalty to Grant, and wartime bravery, historians are generally not able to consider him in a wider context because he did not author an autobiography, nor has he been the subject of an extended biography. Historian William McFeely criticized Babcock for ignoring ethical values in the spirit of opportunism and personal gain.\n\nOn November 22, 2016, Mississippi State University Libraries announced the digitalization of Babcock's private diaries. Babcock's diaries are part of Mississippi State University Libraries' Ulysses S. Grant Digital Collection. Babcock's diaries began in 1863 during the height of the American Civil War, including his perspective on the siege of Vicksburg and his wartime experiences in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia. The diary collections also includes his famous post-war visit to Santo Domingo in 1869 serving as President Grant's special agent and personal secretary. The collection includes Babcock's supplementary materials of speeches, correspondence, and newspaper clippings. The Mississippi State University Libraries said that Babcock's brokerage of the annexation of Santo Domingo, \"began what became a string of controversies and scandals surrounding Babcock and his position as aide to the President.\" The scandals culminated in Babcock's involvement in the Whiskey Ring, indictment for tax fraud in 1875, and corruption trial in St. Louis in 1876. Throughout these scandals President Grant gave Babcock his confidence.\n\nAccording to presidential historian Charles W. Calhoun, Babcock emerged as Grant's \"political majordomo, if not his jackel.\" Babcock's rumored control, although an exaggeration, over Grant's Navy and Army secretaries, \"reflected the impression of Babcock's arrogance and pervasive power.\" Babcock was viewed as Grant's \"Svengali leading the president unto unrighteous paths.\" Many viewed Babcock was dishonest with \"dubious notions of conflict of interest.\" Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish said Babcock \"has brains & very many excellent & gentlemanly qualities but is spoiled by his position & a want of delicacy & consideration for the official responsibilities & proper authority (official) of civilians.\"\n\n\nBooks\nPrimary\n\nInternet articles\n\nNew York Times\n\n"}

Construction workers who sand drywall joint compound are often exposed to high concentrations of dusts, talc, calcite, mica, gypsum, and in some cases, respirable silica.\nSome of these have been associated with varying degrees of eye, nose, throat, and respiratory tract irritation.\n\nOver time, breathing the dust from drywall joint compounds may cause persistent throat and airway irritation, coughing, phlegm production, and breathing difficulties similar to asthma. When silica is present, workers may also face an increased risk of silicosis and lung cancer. There are also asbestos and Mold health issues in removing old drywall, as well as lead paint on drywall first painted several decades ago. For all of these reasons, constant use of a respirator is widely recommended, and even required by some labor authorities. Potential falls from elevated work platforms or ladders are another risk. \n\nJoint compound mixes manufactured prior to the 1980s often contained a complex mixture of several substances.

Only a smaller number of lines had significant interurban characteristics, including long stretches of private rights of way that supported operations at speeds far higher than street traffic; most were located in relatively uncrowded Eastern Connecticut with longer distances between population centers. \n\nFor a brief period from 1916 to 1919, the Shore Line Electric Railway - later called \"one of the few New England electric lines of genuine interurban technology\" - owned all these interurban-type lines. They included the Groton and Stonington Street Railway, the Norwich and Westerly Railway, and the New London Division of the Connecticut Company.

{"id": "1867077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867077", "title": "Battle of Winchelsea", "text": "Battle of Winchelsea\n\nThe Battle of Winchelsea or the Battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer (\"the Spaniards on the Sea\"), was a naval battle that took place on 29 August 1350 and was a victory for an English fleet of 50 ships commanded by King Edward III over a Castilian fleet of 47 larger vessels commanded by Charles de La Cerda. Between 14 and 26 Castilian ships were captured, and several were sunk. Only two English vessels were sunk but there was significant loss of life. The battle was part of the Hundred Years' War between England and France.\n\nEnglish trade, war finance and ability to bring force to bear against France was heavily reliant on seaborne transportation, especially to its territory in Gascony. With its own ability to raise and support a fleet much reduced by English activities, the French hired Castilian ships to blockade English ports. Frustrated by their effectiveness, Edward III himself led the fleet which intercepted them and inflicted heavy losses. In spite of this success English trade and ports had little respite from French, and French-sponsored, naval activity. \n\nSince the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only Gascony in south western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France and Edward III of England, on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last one hundred and sixteen years.\n\nThroughout the early part of the war English coastal areas were harassed by French raids. The port towns of Portsmouth, Southampton, Hastings and Plymouth were captured and razed, as were many smaller places. Numerous English merchant ships, and several warships, were captured. In June 1340 Edward III smashed the French fleet at the Battle of Sluys. In 1346 the English landed in northern Normandy and undertook a devastating chevauchée through northern France. The English navy paralleled the march of the army, capturing or burning large numbers of French warships and merchant vessels as it went. Thereafter the threat from the French navy was much reduced. The English then soundly beat the French at the Battle of Crécy and captured the major French port city of Calais. The Truce of Calais was agreed in September 1347 but the war continued via raids and guerrilla warfare; the ongoing fighting was \"almost constant\".\n\nWhen war did not restrict trade, over 1,000 ships a year departed Gascony for England each year. Among their cargos were over 100,000,000 litres of wine. The duty levied by the crown on wine from Bordeaux was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, was larger than London, and possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this.\n\nIn November 1349, Charles de la Cerda, a soldier of fortune, son of Luis de la Cerda, and member of a branch of the Castilian royal family, sailed from northern Spain, commissioned by the French, with an unknown number of ships. He intercepted and captured several English ships laden with wine from Bordeaux and murdered their crews. Later in the year de la Cerda led a Castilian fleet of 47 ships loaded with Spanish wool from Corunna to Sluys, in Flanders, where it wintered. On the way he captured several additional English ships, again throwing the crews overboard.\n\nIn early 1350 negotiations to renew the truce, brokered by two papal nuncios, were taking place. Nevertheless, the governments of both France and England were actively planning for the renewal of large scale military operations. In February, French intermediaries in Bruges paid 20,000 florins to hire the Castilian fleet as mercenaries. In April it blockaded the English Channel ports, while the French struggled to reinforce it with what native ships they could finance and man. In mid-June a truce was agreed. The Castilians were specifically named in it, and Phillip VI ceased to pay them.\n\nRegardless, the Castilian ships continued to attack the English, now as outright pirates. They had converted their vessels into warships by the addition of wooden castlesraised fighting platformsat the bow and stern and the erection of crow's nest fighting platforms at the masthead. They were based out of Sluys, and several hundred Flemish adventurers joined their ranks, mostly equipped as crossbowmen, in the expectation of plunder. Their assault on English shipping has been described as \"ferocious\", and as bringing \"panic\" to English ports. The English arrayed the coastguard for the first time since the Normandy campaign.\n\nOn 10 August, while the King was at Rotherhithe, he announced his intention of confronting the Castilians. The English fleet was to rendezvous at Sandwich, Kent. Edward had good sources of intelligence in Flanders and knew the composition of De la Cerda's fleet and when it sailed. He determined to intercept it and sailed from Sandwich on 28 August with 50 ships, all smaller than the majority of the Castilian vessels and some much smaller. The King and many of the highest nobility of England, including two of Edward's sons, sailed with the fleet, which was well manned with men-at-arms and archers.\n\nBy the afternoon of 29 August the English fleet was off Dungeness. The king was sitting on the deck of his ship, with his knights and nobles, listening to his minstrels playing German airs, and to the singing of young John Chandos. At 4.00 pm they sighted de la Cerda's force moving towards them with an easterly wind behind. The Castilians had become scattered and the English targeted their main body of approximately twenty-four. When the look-out in the tops reported the enemy in sight, the king and his company drank to one another's health, the trumpet was sounded, and the whole line stood out. There being no effective naval artillery at the time, battles at sea consisted of grappling with and boarding enemy vessels. In order that the Castilians not sweep past them on the wind, the English also ran before the wind, but with shortened sails so as to allow themselves to be overtaken. There seems to have been an hour before fighting commenced.\n\nThe difficulty of the manoeuvre is attested to by the King's own ship, the \"Cog Thomas\", striking the Castilian it was attempting to grapple so heavily as to spring its timbers. At the second attempt it successfully grappled and archers deterred Castilians attempting to drop large rocks from their higher deck. The English ships seemed diminutive alongside the Castilians; \"like castles to cottages\" as a contemporary wrote. Using scaling ladders the men at arms boarded and cleared the deck. Edward transferred his flag, as \"Cog Thomas\" was clearly sinking. His son, Edward Prince of Wales, had a similar experience, his men reportedly barely fighting their way aboard their opponent before their own ship foundered, aided by Henry of Lancaster attacking from the other side. La Cerda's crossbowmen caused many English casualties, firing from their elevated positions as the English closed and then attempted to board. The higher-built and heavier Castilian vessels were able to drop bars of iron or other weights on the lighter English vessels, causing serious damage. The conflict continued until twilight. At the close the English vessel \"La Salle du Roi\", carrying the king's household, and commanded by the Fleming, Robert of Namur, was grappled by a larger Castilian, and was being dragged off by him. A Flemish valet of Robert's, named Hannequin, boarded the enemy and cut the halliards of her mainsail with his sword, allowing other English ships to catch the Castilian, and it was taken.\n\nKing Edward is said to have captured between 14 and 26 of the enemy and it is possible that others were sunk. What his own loss was is not stated, but as his own vessel and the vessel carrying the Black Prince were sunk, and from the peril of \"La Salle du Roi\", it seems likely that the English fleet suffered heavily. Few if any prisoners were taken, dead and wounded Castilians and Flemings were thrown overboard. Much of this action was visible from the English shore, and the clifftops near Winchelsea were lined with spectators, which gave the battle its name.\n\nThere was no pursuit of surviving Castilian ships. They fled to French ports. Joined by French ships they continued to harass English shipping for the rest of the autumn before withdrawing to Sluys to winter. The following spring the Channel was still effectively closed to English shipping unless strongly escorted. Trade with Gascony was less affected, but ships were forced to use ports in western England, often impractically far from their cargo's intended markets. Chroniclers make much of this battle, no doubt because of the royal involvement. But historians point out the heavy English personal casualties and the likelihood of a number of their ships being lost. Others have suggested that it was just one of a number of significant and hard-fought naval encounters of the period, only recorded because of the prominent figures involved. Most stress its lack of effect on the operational or strategic situation.\n\nCharles de la Cerda survived the battle and shortly after was made Constable of France. With communications with Gascony now more secure, the English launched a large expedition from there in 1356 under the Prince of Wales, at the end of which the French suffered a devastating defeat. Edward III continued the war, bringing it to a successful conclusion in 1360 with the Treaty of Brétigny.\n\nThe main contemporaneous account for the battle is Jean Froissart, who was at different times in the service of King Edward and of his wife, Philippa of Hainault, and of the counts of Namur. He repeated what was told him by men who had been present, and dwells as usual on the chivalry of his patrons. However, there are also records from chroniclers Thomas Walsingham and Robert of Avesbury, and later John Stow. Sir Nicholas Nicolas was the first modern historian to tackle this episode in naval warfare.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

He has hosted the Q Awards between 2013 and 2017.\n\nIn February 2018, O'Connell announced he would be leaving Absolute Radio and emigrating to Australia to host the Gold 104.3 breakfast programme in Melbourne. He left \"The Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show\" on 18 May 2018, before starting the new breakfast show on Gold 104.3 on 4 June 2018, featuring his long-running quiz 'Yay or Neigh'.\n\nIn April 2020, Australian Radio Network announced that \"The Christian O'Connell Show\" will be syndicated across the country from Monday 27 April, airing for one hour from 7PM until 8PM on weeknights on Gold 104.3 in Melbourne, WSFM in Sydney, 97.3 FM in Brisbane, Mix 102.3 in Adelaide and 96FM in Perth.\n\nO'Connell was born and raised \"on a lovely council estate in Winchester\"; his father, of Irish origin, was a foreman for Ford at Southampton, and his mother an NHS nurse. His maternal grandmother was Indian, having met her husband, who fought with the Gurkhas in Burma, in India. O'Connell and his wife have two daughters.\n\nO'Connell's first job was as a dustman in Winchester at the age of 16 to earn some cash in the Christmas holidays. Christian started out on 2CR Radio in Bournemouth in 1998. He later moved to Juice FM in Liverpool in 2000. He commented \"It was a budget, tin-pot station. They didn't have a lot of money.\" He formerly hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's weekend sports game show \"Fighting Talk\" from 2004-2006 and the 2013–14 season, the other presenters being BBC Football Commentator Jonathan Pearce and This Morning presenter Matt Johnson.\n\nHe previously hosted the Breakfast Show on indie music station XFM London (January 2001 to October 2005). O'Connell joined the Virgin Radio team making his first broadcast on 23 January 2006. He celebrated his 10th year at Virgin (September 2008 it changed its name to Absolute) by giving his listeners free tins of food.\n\n\nHe has long been a fan of Hollywood action man Steven Seagal, who he had mentioned several times on radio, and remarked that he would love to meet. However, when Seagal rang O'Connell the relationship and understanding between the two was quite difficult and left O'Connell feeling disappointed. Seagal did not understand O'Connell's ironic personality and sense of humour and much of the recorded interview had to be removed from the radio broadcast. \"The Observer\" described the interview as, \"a spectacularly terrible interview in which O'Connell's questions dropped into a seemingly bottomless well of apathy.\" O'Connell described the interview remarking; \"It was the single worst thing I've ever done on radio. And the other week I was having a go at Michael Parkinson, saying he used to be fantastic but sadly now he's become too fawning, and then I did the Seagal thing and I thought: I should just leave.\"\n\nOn 27 October 2006, Liam Gallagher reportedly attempted to phone \"Absolute Radio\" (Virgin radio at the time) on \"Who's calling Christian\" where there is the chance to win £10,000 for charity. Liam was apparently in a drunken state and it took him 3 hours after an aggressive protest to convince Absolute bosses that it was indeed him and not an imposter. A great deal of swearing occurred off air between the managers and Gallagher who swore that he would come down to Absolute Radio and \"Rip Christian O'Connell's fucking head off\". After further phone calls from Polydor records and from Nicole Appleton begging for him to be let on, Gallagher was eventually allowed on and swore live on air on a morning breakfast show. However, he did not complete the conversation, leaving his friend Scully to speak for him. \n\nTony Blair called the \"Who's Calling Christian?\" hotline, after charity campaigner Graham Marsh contacted Blair. If he were to win, Marsh, who received a heart transplant in 1999, said he planned to donate his £10,000 to the two charities he supports - the Freemans Heart and Lung Transplant Association and the Tyne Youth and Community Centre, both in Newcastle upon Tyne. Blair began by telling the programme: \"Probably nothing in my career has prepared me for this.\" When O'Connell asked if he should be referred to as The Right Honourable Tony Blair, the Prime Minister replied: \"\"Refer to me any way you like as long as it's reasonably polite! Tony will do fine... Someone from my constituency phoned me and said 'Why don't we do this?' and I said yes because they are really, really good causes.\"\" The exchange ended with O'Connell asking Blair to choose his favourite song from the 1980s. He chose \"Street With No Name\" by U2 - actually called \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Marsh and Blair resoundingly won the contest on 7 November 2006. \n\nActor David Tennant, a regular on the show and a friend of O'Connell, has been involved in some of the shows and O'Connell's professed \"shabbiest\" moments including the 2006 Christmas panto with Thandie Newton and the axed Mr. T escapade. In late March 2007 he appeared on the Breakfast show again and took part in another escapade \"1 Golden Square\" (the address of Absolute Radio). Later that week when he appeared on a rival show on BBC Radio 1 on the Saturday, Virgin Radio producer Roque Segade-Vieito contacted the station for a practical joke texting a question to Tennant as \"I hear you have been signed up for a new programme called 1 Golden Square\". The question was taken seriously and addressed to Tennant live on Radio 1 leaving O'Connell rather pleased with the gag. \n\nIn November 2009, Tennant co-hosted the Absolute Breakfast Show with O'Connell for three consecutive days. In October 2010, Tennant co-hosted with O'Connell and acted out Copacabana with some of the Breakfast Show team to discover \"just who shot who\", something with had been debated for a few days prior to this. In September 2011, Tennant again co-hosted with O'Connell and experienced a fish-facing with a trout, as well as a tennis ball challenge outside the Absolute Radio studios.\n\nJames Nesbitt, another friend of O'Connell's, has also appeared on the show several times. He also appeared before he moved to Virgin Radio, with a guest appearance on O'Connell's XFM show in 2004.\n\nDavid Cameron appeared on O'Connell's Absolute Radio show twice in 2009. His second appearance caused controversy when the Conservative leader used the expletives \"pissed off\" (referring to the public reaction to the expenses scandal) and (In reference to Twitter) said \"too many twits might make a twat\" while on air.\n\nAustralian comedy duo Hamish and Andy co-hosted a world first simulcast with O'Connell on Friday 18 May 2012. The show was broadcast to coincide with both O'Connell's breakfast show and drive time on the Hamish and Andy Show on Australia's Today Network. In 2016 O'Connell and the show joined up again for a 2-day competition with a race by each of their chosen listener's to win a holiday in the UK or Australia. O'Connell's listener lost and had to endure a return flight to the Uk with no holiday. He appeared again on their show in August 2017 promoting his book Radio Boy.\n\nOn 7 August 2004, O'Connell became the second person to host the BBC Radio 5 Live show \"Fighting Talk\", following the departure of Johnny Vaughan. It was his first outing on national radio (his XFM show was broadcast only in London) and he completed 16 months presenting the show before leaving to focus on his new breakfast show at Virgin Radio (Name Changed to Absolute Radio in 2008). The show won a Gold award at the 24th Sony Radio Academy Awards, with O'Connell accredited as the presenter. O'Connell returned to the FT presenter's chair on 12 January 2013, filling in for his successor (and current host) Colin Murray.\n\nO'Connell returned to Radio 5 Live on Sunday mornings from September 2009, presenting \"The Christian O'Connell Solution\", alongside comedian Bob Mills, as well as two guests. The hour-long show sees the panel provide comedic solutions to various stories appearing in the week's news. From 10 January 2010 it was replaced by \"7 Day Sunday\".\n\nFrom January 2011, he presented the Saturday morning 9:00–11:00 on Radio 5 Live, standing in for Danny Baker.\n\nThe UK's most awarded Radio Dj with a record breaking 11 Sony Gold Awards\n\n\nO'Connell has appeared as a guest on a BBC2 sports show with Dickie Davies as one of the fellow guests. In 2003, Christian replaced Chris Moyles on Channel 5's \"Live With...\" show and went on to present trivia show \"Pub Ammo\" in 2004 on the same channel. In 2005 he also appeared on BBC2's \"Eggheads\" quiz show with Chris Smith, Roque Segade-Vieito and an Xfm listener as the other panelists on his (losing) team. He has also narrated Channel 4's \"Rock School\".\n\nIn May 2006, O'Connell fronted \"Sunday Service\"; a Chris Evans style Sunday evening show on Sky One. In June 2006, O'Connell started his own world cup show, \"World Cuppa\" on ITV4.\n\nIn November 2006, he appeared on the BBC TV gameshow \"The Weakest Link\". The show, recorded in early November, was shown at Christmas 2006. O'Connell admitted on his breakfast show that he went out in the 3rd round after being voted off by his fellow contestants. He blames this on his ridiculous answer to the question \"Which has more legs than the other? A dog or a duck?\" O'Connell answered \"Neither, it's a trick question, they have the same\". O'Connell appeared as a guest in a September 2008 episode of Loose Women and Ready Steady Cook to promote his book, and was reminded of his previous Weakest Link ordeal by Zoe Tyler. He later appeared a second time on a Radio DJ special in mid-2009, but fared much better, being voted off in Round 7. In February 2010, O'Connell appeared as a presenter, commentator and interviewer for the British Association of Mixed Martial Arts (BAMMA), in a similar role to the UFC's Joe Rogan. He then went on to host BT Sports Beyond the Octagon.\n\nHe has appeared on Never Mind the Buzzcoks, 5th Gear, MTV Countdown, Pointless, Win Lose or Draw\n\nO'Connell was the inspiration behind the character Jed Maxwell, the crazed fan in an episode of I'm Alan Partridge.\n\nOn 18 January 2015, O'Connell hosted \"An Evening with Top Gear\" live on the official Top Gear YouTube channel where he interviewed James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson about their upcoming 22nd series of the show.\n\nOn 17 October 2017, O'Connell took part on The Chase (UK game show), but failed to make it past the first round before being eliminated from the game.\n\nO'Connell originally came from Winchester.

This small beginning is regarded as the root of the modern Indian Navy.\n\nThe background to this battle also points to the main reason for the Dutch \"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\" being organised in 1602.\n\nThis battle was the result of the Portuguese monopoly over trade with India in the late-15th and 16th centuries. Two English ventures, The Company of Merchant Adventurers (established 1551) which became the Muscovy Company in 1555, and the English East India Company also known as \"John Company\", (established 1600) were desperately attempting to find routes to the \"East Indies\" and the spice trade. The following three individuals played a key part in the events leading up to this battle:\n\nThe Portuguese guarded their new-found routes to Asia very well. During July, 1583 an English merchant, Ralph Fitch was arrested for spying at Ormuz (near the modern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas). He was on a voyage from Syria to the Indian Ocean in his ship, \"Tiger\", via what is now Iraq using the Euphrates river. Ralph was presented before the Portuguese Viceroy in Goa where he was placed under arrest. He was released on the surety provided by Jesuit priests, but escaped from Goa and wandered around India for several years. He returned to England in 1591, and became a valuable advisor to the Company.\n\nJan Huyghens van Linschoten (1563–1611) was a Dutch Protestant traveller and historian who also served as the Portuguese Viceroy's secretary in Goa between 1583 and 1588. He returned to Holland in 1592. He published a book, \"Itinerario\" in 1596 (later published as an English edition as \"Discours of Voyages into Y East & West Indies\") which graphically displayed for the first time in Europe, detailed maps of voyages to the East Indies, particularly India. During his stay in Goa, abusing the trust put in him by the Viceroy, Jan Huyghens meticulously copied the top-secret charts page-by-page. Even more crucially, Jan Huyghens provided nautical data like currents, deeps, islands and sandbanks, which was absolutely vital for safe navigation, along with coastal depictions to guide the way.\n\nHis publications were also responsible for the establishment of the Dutch East India Company (\"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\") in 1602 to unify Dutch efforts at trade with Asia.\n\nSir William Hawkins led the first voyage of the English East India Company to India and sailed into the Gujarat port of Surat on 24 August 1608 aboard the \"Hector\". He had with him 25,000 pieces of gold and a personal letter to the Mughal Emperor Jehangir (sometimes also rendered as \"Cehangir\" or \"Ichan Guire\") from King James I seeking trade concessions. He persisted for over two years, however pirates stole his gold, and tried several times to murder him while on shore. He returned to England empty-handed. The next envoy, Paul Canning, lasted only a few months.\n\nThe initial voyages of the English East India Company were not necessarily to India. Each voyage was a venture in itself, separately funded by issuance of subscription stock. An eighth voyage was led in 1611 by Captain John Saris to Japan. The ninth voyage (February 1612 – August 1615) was to India and Sumatra.\n\nThe tenth voyage (1612–1614) on behalf of the English East India Company was led by Captain Thomas Best. It set out from Gravesend on 1 February 1612 passing via the present day Trinidad , then Daman on 3 September 1612 eventually reaching Surat on 5 September 1612. Surat was the principal port for the Mughals, and was then situated at the mouth of the river Tapti.\n\nCoincidentally, on 13 September 1612 a squadron of 16 Portuguese barks sailed into Surat. On 22 September 1612 Captain Best decided to send an emissary to the Emperor asking for permission to trade and settle a factory at Surat. If refused he planned to quit the country. This may have been partly because King James I had extended the Company's charter in 1609 on the basis that it would be cancelled if no profitable ventures were concluded within three years.\n\nOn 30 September 1612 Captain Best got news that two of his men, Mr Canning (the purser) and William Chambers were arrested while on shore. Fearing the worst, Captain Best detained a ship belonging to the Governor of Gujarat and offered to release it in exchange for his men.\n\nOn 10 October Captain Best and his ships sailed to Suvali, a small town about North of Surat. This may have been because the Governor (Sardar Khan?) was battling a Rajput rebellion at a fort situated in the town. Between 17–21 October, amidst negotiations he managed to obtain a treaty with the Governor allowing trading privileges, subject to ratification by the Emperor.\n\nA skirmish took place between the two navies on the 29th without much damage to either side.\n\nAt daylight on 30 October, Captain Best in \"Red Dragon\" sailed through the four Portuguese galleons during which three of them ran aground, and was joined by \"Hosiander\" on the other side. The Portuguese managed to get the three galleons refloated.\n\nAt 9pm that night in an attempt to set the English ships alight, a bark was sent towards them as a fire ship. But the English watch was alert, and the bark was sunk by cannon fire with the loss of eight lives.\n\nA standoff remained until 5 December, when Captain Best sailed for the port of Diu.\n\nOn 6 January 1613, Captain Best received a letter from the Emperor ratifying the treaty, which was presented by the Governor. Captain Best then ordered one of his men, Anthony Starkey, on 16 January to leave for England, via land, carrying letters of their success. Mr Starkey was later poisoned by two Jesuit priests.\n\nCaptain Best then continued on to Ceylon on 18 January, and then onwards to Sumatra, before returning to England around April 1614 without returning to India.\n\nThis event sufficiently impressed the \"Sardar\" (Governor) of Gujarat, who reported it to the Emperor. Thereafter the Emperor was more favourable towards the English than the Portuguese.\n\n\n4 galleons<br>\n26 oared barks\n\nSwally is the anglicization of Suvali. Suvali port is close to the modern day village of Suvali, located in Surat, India.\n\nThe port was constructed by the English as they found it protected both from sudden squalls and military attacks. Besides, the English found it convenient to use the place for their early trade with Surat as Swally was navigable in low tides. There were several complications in using the ports at Surat as the French and the Portuguese also operated from there.\n\nMr. R Sengupta, the Chief Project Co-ordinator (coastal and marine ecology) of GES advised that, \"The port was also better than those located in the mouth of river Tapti. The English did not allow anyone to use the port at Swally and used to charge duty for permission to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867096", "title": "Andronikos I of Trebizond", "text": "Andronikos I of Trebizond\n\nAndronikos I Gidos or Andronicus I Gidus (), was an Emperor of Trebizond (1222–1235). He is the only ruler of Trebizond who was not a blood relative of the founder of that state, Alexios I Megas Komnenos. George Finlay suggests he may be the same Andronikos who was a general of Theodore I Laskaris. During his reign, Trebizond successfully withstood a siege of the city by the Seljuk Turks, and later supported the Shah of Khwarizm in the latter's unsuccessful battle with the Seljuks.\n\nThe Gidos family appears briefly in Byzantine history at the turn of the 12th/13th century. The etymology of the surname is uncertain, but one view considers it to be from the Greek word for \"goat\" ('Gida' γίδα f., γίδι), another speculative view suggests that the etymology of the surname may be of Latin origin, and is the hellenized form of the Italian name \"Guido\". This in turn led some scholars to theorize that there may be a connection with the Gidos family and Guy/Guido, a son of the Norman conqueror of southern Italy, Robert Guiscard, who defected to the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (ruled 1081–1118) centuries earlier, entered his service and possibly married into the imperial family. Byzantine sources do not treat the family as having a foreign origin and it has not been possible to demonstrate any connection with the son of Robert Guiscard or a Latin origin. W. Hecht casts doubt on a Latin origin of the family.\n\nApart from the \"megas domestikos\" Alexios Gidos, who lived in the 12th century, the only other prominent individual bearing the surname \"Gidos\" is an Andronikos Gidos, a general of the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris, who defeated the Latin allies of David Komnenos (along with his brother Alexios the co-founder of the Empire of Trebizond) in 1206. Finlay first suggested that the general should be identified with the later Trapezuntine emperor, a suggestion adopted by many Byzantine historians, in the words of Anthony Bryer, \"for want of any other candidate\". Bryer continues, \"The name Gidos (Gidon) is sufficiently rare to make the proposal plausible, indeed one wonders whether it was on the way to becoming an epithet in itself,\" then provides a number of examples of \"Gidos\" being used in the Pontic region as a synonym for \"guardian.\"\n\nOn the death of the Emperor Alexios, control of the empire passed over Alexios' oldest son, John in favor of Andronikos. The steps that led to Andronikos' ascension have not been recorded. Finlay assumes that \"the hereditary principle\" of succession had not become common practice for the Empire of Trebizond at this point. Although William Miller assumes that John was not old enough to assume the throne, one primary source attests that more than one son was, indeed, old enough to do so: during the siege of Sinope, according to Ibn Bibi, when Kaykaus I told the city that unless they surrendered he would kill Alexios, who was his prisoner, the inhabitants replied that \"he has grown sons in Trebizond who are capable of governing. We will elect one of them as our ruler and will not surrender the country to the Turks.\" Miller describes Andronikos Gidos as \"a shrewd man of great experience in warfare\". His experience at war served the new-born polity well in facing a serious attack on the capital in 1224.\n\nAndronikos married a daughter of Alexios I of Trebizond and Theodora Axuchina, whose first name is unknown. Komnene is the female form of \"Komnenos,\" her family name. Her siblings included John I of Trebizond and Manuel I of Trebizond.\n\nThe Seljuk Turks occupied Sudak in the Crimea and constructed a fortress there between 1220 and 1222. In 1223 the Seljuk governor of Sinope sent ships to attack the coast of Trapezuntine Crimea (the so-called Perateia) in an effort to divert trade into his port. A ship carrying the annual tribute of Perateia, with the archon of the province and a number of notables from Cherson on board, was driven by a storm into Sinope's harbour. In violation of a treaty agreed to by the Turks and the Empire of Trebizond in 1220, the city's governor, Hetum, seized the vessel with its cargo, passengers, and crew and also sent a fleet to plunder Perateia. In response, Andronikos assembled a fleet and dispatched it against Sinope. His men plundered up to the walls of the \"mart\" and killed or captured the crews of the ships lying in the harbour. They rescued the captive archon, his ship and his money, as well as all the plunder carried off from Cherson.\n\nUpon learning of this attack, Sultan Melik marched on Trebizond. In response to the sultan's threat, Andronikos summoned all his troops and fortified the passes leading to the city. The emperor inflicted considerable loss upon the advance guard of the sultan before withdrawing within the walls of the city, which were already accounted impregnable although they did not yet extend to the sea. At this point the siege of the city began.\n\nThe sultan made camp near the Monastery of Saint Eugenios, and set fire to the suburbs outside the walls. A string of attacks and counterattacks followed over the next few days (punctuated by a Seljuk embassy being shown the ample stores inside the city) ended with an attempt to storm the walls by night. This last attack failed when a sudden thunderstorm, accompanied by torrential rain and hail, terrified and scattered the besiegers. Some rode over the cliffs in the dark into the ravines, others were caught by swollen torrents from the mountains.\n\nMelik was brought a prisoner to Trebizond, where Andronikos received him with honor. A pact was made between them that in the future the tie of vassalage, which had previously bound Trebizond to Iconium, should cease, and that the Trapezuntines should no longer be obliged either to perform military service to the sultan or to send tribute or gifts. Melik is reported to have been so impressed by this moderation that he performed more than the treaty required by sending an annual present of Arab horses to Andronikos and money to the Monastery of St Eugenios.\n\nThe siege of 1224 is the source of two early legends of the St Eugenios cult. Fear of the army of Melik is said to have driven many Trapezuntines to the sanctuaries of Panagia Chrysokephalos and church of Saint Eugenios. In the first legend, the account of the siege compiled by John Lazaropoulos, who, under the name of Joseph, was Metropolitan of Trebizond in the second half of the fourteenth century, narrates the legend that a further ruse was perpetrated by the outraged St Eugenios, who appeared to Melik, the profaner of his shrine, in the guise of mayor of the city, who held its keys, and pretended to have been sent by the suffering citizens to invite him to enter. The Sultan's suspicions were calmed by his astrologers, who told him that his entry into the city was written in the stars. In the second, Melik fled, only to fall into the hands of the mountaineers from Matzouka, and 150 years later a shrine erected to St Eugenios still marked the spot of his capture. Traditional accounts of the siege emphasise the sultan's threats to destroy churches, especially the monastery of St Eugenios, even though destroying churches was not usual Seljuk practice. The church of the Panagia Chrysokephalos and St Eugenios both grew richer from the spoils of the siege.\n\nThe independence of Trebizond lasted only until 1230. Jalal-ad-din, the Sultan of Khwarizm, invaded Anatolia in a direct challenge to the Sultanate of Iconium. Jalal-ad-din, who had conquered Georgia in the 1220s, was now a neighbour of Trebizond. Andronikos considered neutrality impossible and made an alliance with the Khwarizmshah, and agreed to war with the Seljuks. Many of Jalal-ad-din's troops, after their defeat at the Battle of Yassıçemen in 1230, sought refuge at Trebizond, that the Trapezuntine contingent had assisted the Shah in that battle.\n\nThe alliance with Jalal ad-Din cost Andronikos the loss of the privileges which he had gained in his treaty with Kaykaus. Trebizond once more became a vassal to the Sultan of Iconium. About 1240 Vincent de Beauvais reports the ruler of Trebizond used to send the sultan 200 lances (1,000 men). Nor was this the only loss of this reign.\n\nThe Mongols occupied a large part of Georgia. Iberia and Lazica, which had been subject to Trebizond, whose eastern frontier had been Soteropolis, separated themselves from the empire and formed an independent kingdom of Imereti under David VI Narin, son of the Georgian Queen Rusudan.\n\nAndronikos is the earliest Emperor of Trebizond whose coins have survived. A number of bronze trachea (also called scyphates) have been identified as having been struck during his reign. These bear the image of the Virgin Mary seated on a throne and holding an icon of the Christ Child—somewhat similar to the obverses of the later aspers of Manuel I—while on the reverse appears an emperor with a forked beard and Christ standing beside him with his hand raised in benediction.\n\n"}

However, they have in common that the changes are not made visible to any unrelated transactions until the outermost transaction has committed. This means that a commit in an inner transaction does not necessarily persist updates to the system.\n\nIn some databases, changes made by the nested transaction are not seen by the 'host' transaction until the nested transaction is committed. According to some, this follows from the isolation property of transactions.\n\nThe capability to handle nested transactions properly is a prerequisite for true component-based application architectures. In a component-based encapsulated architecture, nested transactions can occur without the programmer knowing it. A component function may or may not contain a database transaction (this is the encapsulated secret of the component. See Information hiding). If a call to such a component function is made inside a BEGIN - COMMIT bracket, nested transactions occur. Since popular databases like MySQL do not allow nesting BEGIN - COMMIT brackets, a framework or a transaction monitor is needed to handle this. When we speak about nested transactions, it should be made clear that this feature is DBMS dependent and is not available for all databases.\n\nTheory for nested transactions is similar to the theory for flat transactions.\n\nThe banking industry usually processes financial transactions using \"open nested transactions\", which is a looser variant of the nested transaction model that provides higher performance while accepting the accompanying trade-offs of inconsistency.\n\n"}

Composed between 1907 and 1908, the \"Rapsodie\" is one of Ravel's first major works for orchestra. It was first performed in Paris in 1908 and quickly entered the international repertoire. The piece draws on the composer's Spanish heritage, and is one of several of his works set in or reflecting Spain.\n\nThe genesis of the \"Rapsodie\" was a Habanera, for two pianos, which Ravel wrote in 1895. It was not published as a separate piece, and in 1907 he composed three companion pieces. A two-piano version was completed by October of that year, and the suite was fully orchestrated the following February. At about this time there was a distinctly Spanish tone to Ravel's output, perhaps reflecting his own Spanish ancestry. His opera \"L'heure espagnole\" was completed in 1907, as was the song \"Vocalise-Etude en forme de habanera\".\n\nIn the interval between the composition of the original Habanera and the completion of the four-movement \"Rapsodie\", Claude Debussy had published a piano suite, \"Estampes\" (1903), of which the middle section, \"Soirée dans Grenade\", had a Spanish theme. To counter any accusations of plagiarism, Ravel made certain that the date 1895 was clearly printed for his Habanera in the published score of the \"Rapsodie\".\n\nThe première of the \"Rapsodie\" was given by the Orchestre des Concerts Colonne, conducted by Édouard Colonne, at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 15 March 1908. The critical reception was generally favourable. Dissenting voices were Pierre Lalo, who habitually disliked Ravel's music, and Gaston Carraud, who called the score \"slender, inconsistent and fugitive\". Otherwise there was much praise for the subtle and fresh orchestration and the picturesqueness of the music. The work was soon taken up internationally. Henry Wood gave the British premiere in October 1909 to a capacity audience at the Proms, and the following month the work was first given in New York.\n\nThe work is scored for an orchestra of 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 soprano clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, sarrusophone, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, castanets, tambourine, gong, snare drum, xylophone, celesta, 2 harps and strings.\n\nThe \"Rapsodie\" has four movements; a complete performance typically lasts around 15 minutes.\n\nThe movement is marked \"très modéré\"; the time signature is and the key is A major. The whole movement is quiet, never rising above mezzo forte; the strings are muted throughout. As in the String Quartet of three years earlier Ravel places themes in the opening movement that recur in subsequent sections, most particularly the insistent opening theme, F–E–D–C.\n\nThis is the shortest of the four movements, and is marked \"assez vif\" (\"fairly lively\"). Malagueña refers to a flamenco dance from the southern Spanish province of Málaga, but Ravel's music here has only the meter in common with the authentic dance. The movement is instead what the critic Noël Goodwin calls \"more a romantic evocation of place and mood\". Like the first movement, it is in the key of A, though slightly ambiguous as to whether it is major or minor.

Such substances are often similar in structure to the metabolite that they interfere with, such as the antifolates that interfere with the use of folic acid; thus, competitive inhibition can occur, and the presence of antimetabolites can have toxic effects on cells, such as halting cell growth and cell division, so these compounds are used as chemotherapy for cancer.\n\nAntimetabolites can be used in cancer treatment, as they interfere with DNA production and therefore cell division and tumor growth. Because cancer cells spend more time dividing than other cells, inhibiting cell division harms tumor cells more than other cells. Antimetabolite drugs are commonly used to treat leukemia, cancers of the breast, ovary, and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as other types of cancers. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System antimetabolite cancer drugs are classified under L01B.\n\nAntimetabolites generally impair DNA replication machinery, either by incorporation of chemically altered nucleotides or by depleting the supply of deoxynucleotides needed for DNA replication and cell proliferation.\n\nExamples of cancer drug antimetabolites include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nAnti-metabolites masquerade as a purine (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) or a pyrimidine, chemicals that become the building-blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated into DNA during the S phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and cell division. Anti-metabolites also affect RNA synthesis. However, because thymidine is used in DNA but not in RNA (where uracil is used instead), inhibition of thymidine synthesis via thymidylate synthase selectively inhibits DNA synthesis over RNA synthesis.\n\nDue to their efficiency, these drugs are the most widely used cytostatics. Competition for the binding sites of enzymes that participate in essential biosynthetic processes and subsequent incorporation of these biomolecules into nucleic acids, inhibits their normal tumor cell function and triggers apoptosis, the cell death process. Because of this mode of action, most antimetabolites have high cell cycle specificity and can target arrest of cancer cell DNA replication.\n\nAntimetabolites may also be antibiotics, such as sulfanilamide drugs, which inhibit dihydrofolate synthesis in bacteria by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is needed in enzymatic reactions that produce folic acid, which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, the building-blocks of DNA. Mammals do not synthesize their own folic acid so they are unaffected by PABA inhibitors, which selectively kill bacteria. Sulfanilamide drugs are not like the antibiotics used to treat infections. Instead, they work by changing the DNA inside cancer cells to keep them from growing and multiplying. Antitumor antibiotics are a class of antimetabolite drugs that are cell cycle nonspecific. They act by binding with DNA molecules and preventing RNA (ribonucleic acid) synthesis, a key step in the creation of proteins, which are necessary for cancer cell survival.\n\nAnthracyclines are anti-tumor antibiotics that interfere with enzymes involved in copying DNA during the cell cycle.\n\nExamples of anthracyclines include:\n\nAnti-tumor antibiotics that are not anthracyclines include:\n\nAntimetabolites, particularly mitomycin C (MMC), are commonly used in America and Japan as an addition to trabeculectomy, a surgical procedure to treat glaucoma.\n\nAntimetabolites have been shown to decrease fibrosis of operative sites. Thus, its use following external dacryocystorhinostomy, a procedure for the management of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, is being researched.\n\nIntraoperative antimetabolite application, namely mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is currently being tested for its effectiveness of managing pterygium.\n\nMain categories of these drugs include:\n\n\n"}

Anton Maria Anderledy, S.J., (3 June 1819 – 18 January 1892) was a Swiss Jesuit, elected the twenty-third Superior General of the Society of Jesus.\n\nSon of a director of the postal services, Anderledy entered the Jesuit novitiate at Brig in 1838. After the novitiate, he taught for 2 years (1842–44) the classics at the college of Fribourg, where he excelled as a Latin scholar. Philosophy was done in Rome (1844–47) where he began also his theological studies. For reason of health, however he moved back to Fribourg. When the Jesuits were expelled from Switzerland (November 1847), Anderledy carried on his theological studies for a while in Chambéry (Savoy) from where another expulsion order (March 1848) drove him with fifty others to the United States. Still a student of Theology he completed the course in St. Louis, Missouri, and was finally ordained priest (29 September 1848) there, by Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick.\n\nFor two years (1848–50) Anderledy took care of the pastoral needs of the German migrants at Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he devoted himself with great energy to his flock. He was recalled to Europe in 1850, first in order to make his final year of formation (called 'Tertianship') in Drongen, Belgium and soon after (1851), in Germany, to be a member of the 'missionary band' led by Father Peter Roh. With him he took part in more than 40 popular missions in different German towns. In 1853, he was chosen to be rector of Jesuit students in Cologne. He accompanied them to Paderborn and remained in charge of their studies until 1859, when he was appointed Provincial of the German Province. During Anderledy's term of office, which lasted six years, he purchased the splendid medieval abbey of Maria Laach, near Bonn, where he established the province-house of higher studies. In 1865, he was himself sent to Maria-Laach as professor of moral theology. From there he launched the well-known Theological journal \"Stimmen aus Maria-Laach\". In 1870, Anderledy was called to Rome as Assistant to the Jesuit Superior-General, for the German-speaking provinces.\n\nSuperior General Pieter Beckx, 88 years old and infirm, had called a General Congregation in order that a Vicar General (with rights of succession) be given him. Due to the great uncertainty of the political situation in Italy, General Congregation XXIII did not meet in Rome but at Fiesole (Firenze) in 1883. The electors chose with near unanimity Anton Anderledy as Vicar-General (and Successor to be) of Pieter Beckx. The same Congregation passed also a decree that condemned 'Liberalism in the Church' and strengthened Theological and scientific formation in the Society. It did express also strong support for the Gregorian University.\n\nIn January 1884 Anderledy assumed all the duties of the Superior-General as Beckx went into retirement in Rome. On Beckx's death in 1887, Anderledy became in title the Superior-General of the Society of Jesus. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1867129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867129", "title": "Binary quadratic form", "text": "Binary quadratic form\n\nIn mathematics, a binary quadratic form is a quadratic homogeneous polynomial in two variables\n\nwhere \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are the coefficients. When the coefficients can be arbitrary complex numbers, most results are not specific to the case of two variables, so they are described in quadratic form. A quadratic form with integer coefficients is called an integral binary quadratic form, often abbreviated to \"binary quadratic form\".\n\nThis article is entirely devoted to integral binary quadratic forms. This choice is motivated by their status as the driving force behind the development of algebraic number theory. Since the late nineteenth century, binary quadratic forms have given up their preeminence in algebraic number theory to quadratic and more general number fields, but advances specific to binary quadratic forms still occur on occasion.\n\nPierre Fermat stated that if p is an odd prime then the equation formula_2 has a solution iff formula_3, and he made similar statement about the equations formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7\nformula_8 and so on are quadratic forms, and the theory of quadratic forms gives a unified way of looking at and proving these theorems\n\nAnother instance of quadratic forms is Pell's equation formula_9\n\nBinary quadratic forms are closely related to ideals in quadratic fields, this allows the class number of a quadratic field to be calculated by counting the number of reduced binary quadratic forms of a given discriminant\n\nThe classical theta function of 2 variables is formula_10, if formula_11 is a positive definite quadratic form then formula_12 is a theta function\n\nTwo forms \"f\" and \"g\" are called equivalent if there exist integers formula_13 such that the following conditions hold:\n\nFor example, with formula_15 and formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, and formula_19, we find that \"f\" is equivalent to formula_20, which simplifies to formula_21.\n\nThe above equivalence conditions define an equivalence relation on the set of integral quadratic forms. It follows that the quadratic forms are partitioned into equivalence classes, called classes of quadratic forms. A class invariant can mean either a function defined on equivalence classes of forms or a property shared by all forms in the same class.\n\nLagrange used a different notion of equivalence, in which the second condition is replaced by formula_22. Since Gauss it has been recognized that this definition is inferior to that given above. If there is a need to distinguish, sometimes forms are called properly equivalent using the definition above and improperly equivalent if they are equivalent in Lagrange's sense.\n\nIn matrix terminology, which is used occasionally below, when\n\nhas integer entries and determinant 1, the map formula_24 is a (right) group action of formula_25 on the set of binary quadratic forms. The equivalence relation above then arises from the general theory of group actions.\n\nIf formula_26, then important invariants include\n\n\nTerminology has arisen for classifying classes and their forms in terms of their invariants. A form of discriminant formula_28 is definite if formula_29, degenerate if formula_28 is a perfect square, and indefinite otherwise. A form is primitive if its content is 1, that is, if its coefficients are coprime. If a form's discriminant is a fundamental discriminant, then the form is primitive. Discriminants satisfy formula_31\n\nIf \"f\" is a quadratic form, a matrix\n\nin formula_25 is an automorphism of \"f\" if formula_34. For example, the matrix\n\nis an automorphism of the form formula_36. The automorphisms of a form form a subgroup of formula_25. When \"f\" is definite, the group is finite, and when \"f\" is indefinite, it is infinite and cyclic.\n\nWe say that a binary quadratic form formula_38 represents an integer formula_39 if it is possible to find integers formula_40 and formula_41 satisfying the equation formula_42 Such an equation is a representation of \"n\" by \"f\".\n\nDiophantus considered whether, for an odd integer formula_39, it is possible to find integers formula_40 and formula_41 for which formula_46. When formula_47, we have\n\nso we find pairs formula_49 that do the trick. We obtain more pairs that work by switching the values of formula_40 and formula_41 and/or by changing the sign of one or both of formula_40 and formula_41. In all, there are sixteen different solution pairs. On the other hand, when formula_54, the equation\n\ndoes not have integer solutions. To see why, we note that formula_56 unless formula_57 or formula_58. Thus, formula_59 will exceed 3 unless formula_60 is one of the nine pairs with formula_40 and formula_41 each equal to formula_63 or 1. We can check these nine pairs directly to see that none of them satisfies formula_64, so the equation does not have integer solutions.\n\nA similar argument shows that for each formula_39, the equation formula_66 can have only a finite number of solutions since formula_59 will exceed formula_39 unless the absolute values formula_69 and formula_70 are both less than formula_71. There are only a finite number of pairs satisfying this constraint.\n\nAnother ancient problem involving quadratic forms asks us to solve Pell's equation. For instance, we may seek integers \"x\" and \"y\" so that formula_72. Changing signs of \"x\" and \"y\" in a solution gives another solution, so it is enough to seek just solutions in positive integers. One solution is formula_73, that is, there is an equality formula_74. If formula_60 is any solution to formula_76, then formula_77 is another such pair. For instance, from the pair formula_78, we compute\n\nand we can check that this satisfies formula_80. Iterating this process, we find further pairs formula_60 with formula_72:\n\nThese values will keep growing in size, so we see there are infinitely many ways to represent 1 by the form formula_84. This recursive description was discussed in Theon of Smyrna's commentary on Euclid's Elements.\n\nThe oldest problem in the theory of binary quadratic forms is the representation problem: describe the representations of a given number formula_39 by a given quadratic form \"f\". \"Describe\" can mean various things: give an algorithm to generate all representations, a closed formula for the number of representations, or even just determine whether any representations exist.\n\nThe examples above discuss the representation problem for the numbers 3 and 65 by the form formula_86 and for the number 1 by the form formula_84. We see that 65 is represented by formula_86 in sixteen different ways, while 1 is represented by formula_84 in infinitely many ways and \n3 is not represented by formula_59 at all. In the first case, the sixteen representations were explicitly described. It was also shown that the number of representations of an integer by formula_59 is always finite. The sum of squares function formula_92 gives the number of representations of \"n\" by formula_59 as a function of \"n\". There is a closed formula\n\nwhere formula_95 is the number of divisors of \"n\" that are congruent to 1 modulo 4 and formula_96 is the number of divisors of \"n\" that are congruent to 3 modulo 4.\n\nThere are several class invariants relevant to the representation problem:\n\n\nThe minimum absolute value represented by a class is zero for degenerate classes and positive for definite and indefinite classes. All numbers represented by a definite form formula_97 have the same sign: positive if formula_98 and negative if formula_99. For this reason, the former are called positive definite forms and the latter are negative definite.\n\nThe number of representations of an integer \"n\" by a form \"f\" is finite if \"f\" is definite and infinite if \"f\" is indefinite. We saw instances of this in the examples above: formula_59 is positive definite and formula_84 is indefinite.\n\nThe notion of equivalence of forms can be extended to equivalent representations. Representations formula_102 and formula_103 are equivalent if there exists a matrix\n\nwith integer entries and determinant 1 so that formula_105 and\n\nThe above conditions give a (right) action of the group formula_25 on the set of representations of integers by binary quadratic forms. It follows that equivalence defined this way is an equivalence relation and in particular that the forms in equivalent representations are equivalent forms.\n\nAs an example, let formula_36 and consider a representation formula_109. Such a representation is a solution to the Pell equation described in the examples above. The matrix\n\nhas determinant 1 and is an automorphism of \"f\". Acting on the representation formula_109 by this matrix yields the equivalent representation formula_112. This is the recursion step in the process described above for generating infinitely many solutions to formula_72. Iterating this matrix action, we find that the infinite set of representations of 1 by \"f\" that were determined above are all equivalent.\n\nThere are generally finitely many equivalence classes of representations of an integer \"n\" by forms of given nonzero discriminant formula_28. A complete set of representatives for these classes can be given in terms of \"reduced forms\" defined in the section below. When formula_29, every representation is equivalent to a unique representation by a reduced form, so a complete set of representatives is given by the finitely many representations of \"n\" by reduced forms of discriminant formula_28. When formula_117, Zagier proved that every representation of a positive integer \"n\" by a form of discriminant formula_28 is equivalent to a unique representation formula_119 in which \"f\" is reduced in Zagier's sense and formula_120, formula_121. The set of all such representations constitutes a complete set of representatives for equivalence classes of representations.\n\nLagrange proved that for every value \"D\", there are only finitely many classes of binary quadratic forms with discriminant \"D\". Their number is the of discriminant \"D\". He described an algorithm, called reduction, for constructing a canonical representative in each class, the reduced form, whose coefficients are the smallest in a suitable sense.\n\nGauss gave a superior reduction algorithm in \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", which ever since has been the reduction algorithm most commonly given in textbooks. In 1981, Zagier published an alternative reduction algorithm which has found several uses as an alternative to Gauss's.\n\nComposition most commonly refers to a binary operation on primitive equivalence classes of forms of the same discriminant, one of the deepest discoveries of Gauss, which makes this set into a finite abelian group called the form class group (or simply class group) of discriminant formula_28. Class groups have since become one of the central ideas in algebraic number theory. From a modern perspective, the class group of a fundamental discriminant formula_28 is isomorphic to the narrow class group of the quadratic field formula_124 of discriminant formula_28. For negative formula_28, the narrow class group is the same as the ideal class group, but for positive formula_28 it may be twice as big.\n\n\"Composition\" also sometimes refers to, roughly, a binary operation on binary quadratic forms. The word \"roughly\" indicates two caveats: only certain pairs of binary quadratic forms can be composed, and the resulting form is not well-defined (although its equivalence class is). The composition operation on equivalence classes is defined by first defining composition of forms and then showing that this induces a well-defined operation on classes.\n\n\"Composition\" can also refer to a binary operation on representations of integers by forms. This operation is substantially more complicated than composition of forms, but arose first historically. We will consider such operations in a separate section below.\n\nComposition means taking 2 quadratic forms of the same discriminant and combining them to create a quadratic form of the same discriminant, it is a generalization of the 2-square identity formula_128\n\nA variety of definitions of composition of forms has been given, often in an attempt to simplify the extremely technical and general definition of Gauss. We present here Arndt's method, because it remains rather general while being simple enough to be amenable to computations by hand. An alternative definition is described at Bhargava cubes.\n\nSuppose we wish to compose forms formula_129 and formula_130, each primitive and of the same discriminant formula_28. We perform the following steps:\n\n\nThe form formula_138 is \"the\" composition of formula_139 and formula_140. We see that its first coefficient is well-defined, but the other two depend on the choice of \"B\" and \"C\". One way to make this a well-defined operation is to make an arbitrary convention for how to choose \"B\"—for instance, choose \"B\" to be the smallest positive solution to the system of congruences above. Alternatively, we may view the result of composition, not as a form, but as an equivalence class of forms modulo the action of the group of matrices of the form\n\nwhere \"n\" is an integer. If we consider the class of formula_138 under this action, the middle coefficients of the forms in the class form a congruence class of integers modulo 2\"A\". Thus, composition gives a well-defined function from pairs of binary quadratic forms to such classes.\n\nIt can be shown that if formula_139 and formula_140 are equivalent to formula_145 and formula_146 respectively, then the composition of formula_139 and formula_140 is equivalent to the composition of formula_145 and formula_146. It follows that composition induces a well-defined operation on primitive classes of discriminant formula_28, and as mentioned above, Gauss showed these classes form a finite abelian group. The identity class in the group is the unique class containing all forms formula_152, i.e., with first coefficient 1. (It can be shown that all such forms lie in a single class, and the restriction formula_153 implies that there exists such a form of every discriminant.) To invert a class, we take a representative formula_138 and form the class of formula_155. Alternatively, we can form the class of formula_156 since this and formula_155 are equivalent.\n\nGauss also considered a coarser notion of equivalence, with each coarse class called a genus of forms. Each genus is the union of a finite number of equivalence classes of the same discriminant, with the number of classes depending only on the discriminant. In the context of binary quadratic forms, genera can be defined either through congruence classes of numbers represented by forms or by genus characters defined on the set of forms. A third definition is a special case of the genus of a quadratic form in n variables. This states that forms are in the same genus if they are locally equivalent at all rational primes (including the Archimedean place).\n\nThere is circumstantial evidence of protohistoric knowledge of algebraic identities involving binary quadratic forms. The first problem concerning binary quadratic forms asks for the existence or construction of representations of integers by particular binary quadratic forms. The prime examples are the solution of Pell's equation and the representation of integers as sums of two squares. Pell's equation was already considered by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in the 7th century CE. Several centuries later, his ideas were extended to a complete solution of Pell's equation known as the chakravala method, attributed to either of the Indian mathematicians Jayadeva or Bhāskara II. The problem of representing integers by sums of two squares was considered in the 3rd century by Diophantus. In the 17th century, inspired while reading Diophantus's Arithmetica, Fermat made several observations about representations by specific quadratic forms including that which is now known as Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. Euler provided the first proofs of Fermat's observations and added some new conjectures about representations by specific forms, without proof.\n\nThe general theory of quadratic forms was initiated by Lagrange in 1775 in his \"Recherches d'Arithmétique\". Lagrange was the first to realize that \"a coherent general theory required the simulatenous consideration of all forms.\" He was the first to recognize the importance of the discriminant and to define the essential notions of equivalence and reduction, which, according to Weil, have \"dominated the whole subject of quadratic forms ever since\". Lagrange showed that there are finitely many equivalence classes of given discriminant, thereby defining for the first time an arithmetic class number. His introduction of reduction allowed the quick enumeration of the classes of given discriminant and foreshadowed the eventual development of infrastructure. In 1798, Legendre published \"Essai sur la théorie des nombres\", which summarized the work of Euler and Lagrange and added some of his own contributions, including the first glimpse of a composition operation on forms.\n\nThe theory was vastly extended and refined by Gauss in Section V of \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\". Gauss introduced a very general version of a composition operator that allows composing even forms of different discriminants and imprimitive forms. He replaced Lagrange's equivalence with the more precise notion of proper equivalence, and this enabled him to show that the primitive classes of given discriminant form a group under the composition operation. He introduced genus theory, which gives a powerful way to understand the quotient of the class group by the subgroup of squares. (Gauss and many subsequent authors wrote 2\"b\" in place of \"b\"; the modern convention allowing the coefficient of \"xy\" to be odd is due to Eisenstein).\n\nThese investigations of Gauss strongly influenced both the arithmetical theory of quadratic forms in more than two variables and the subsequent development of algebraic number theory, where quadratic fields are replaced with more general number fields. But the impact was not immediate. Section V of \"Disquisitiones\" contains truly revolutionary ideas and involves very complicated computations, sometimes left to the reader. Combined, the novelty and complexity made Section V notoriously difficult. Dirichlet published simplifications of the theory that made it accessible to a broader audience. The culmination of this work is his text \"Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie\". The third edition of this work includes two supplements by Dedekind. Supplement XI introduces ring theory, and from then on, especially after the 1897 publication of Hilbert's \"Zahlbericht\", the theory of binary quadratic forms lost its preeminent position in algebraic number theory and became overshadowed by the more general theory of algebraic number fields.\n\nEven so, work on binary quadratic forms with integer coefficients continues to the present. This includes numerous results about quadratic number fields, which can often be translated into the language of binary quadratic forms, but also includes developments about forms themselves or that originated by thinking about forms, including Shanks's infrastructure, Zagier's reduction algorithm, Conway's topographs, and Bhargava's reinterpretation of composition through Bhargava cubes.\n\n\n\n"}

It links Charikar and Kabul in the south with Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in the north. Before the road and tunnel were built, the main route between Kabul and northern Afghanistan was via the Shibar Pass, a much longer route which took three days.\n\nThe road through the pass has carried heavy military traffic in recent conflicts and is in very bad repair.\n\nOn 3 November 1982, during the Soviet–Afghan War, there was a huge fire in the tunnel which at the time was filled with Soviet military convoys. A very large, but unknown number, of Soviet troops were killed in the Salang tunnel fire.\n\nOn February 9, 2010, the pass was hit by multiple avalanches. According to press reports the road through the pass was hit by 17 avalanches, killing dozens, burying miles of highway, and trapping the vehicles in the Salang tunnel.\nBy February 10, 2010 authorities had recovered over 160 bodies. Radio Free Europe reported the first avalanche blocked the tunnel, and trapped vehicles in a traffic jam in a \"deadly avalanche zone\".\n\n"}

The term includes many independent island nations, British Overseas Territories and nations on the mainland. The emphasis on the English language has led other terms to also describe the grouping, such as the Anglo Caribbean, Anglophone Caribbean or English-speaking Caribbean. The term is now used in preference over the older term \"\"British West Indies\"\" which was used to describe the British colonies in the West Indies \"(therefore not including Belize and Guyana)\" during decolonisation and following independence from the United Kingdom. The term Anglo Caribbean or the British Commonwealth Caribbean, traditionally becomes the preferred sub-regional term as a replacement to British West Indies.\n\nThe Commonwealth Caribbean consists of nations and territories, which include Caribbean islands or parts of the mainland surrounding the Caribbean Sea of North and South Americas.\n\nThere are 10 independent island nations within the Commonwealth Caribbean:\n\nThere are two independent \"Mainland Caribbean\" nations:\n\nThe term may also be applied to British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean as they are also English-speaking and the United Kingdom is a member of the Commonwealth. However, other terms may also be used to specifically refer to these territories, such as \"British overseas territories in the Caribbean\", \"British Caribbean territories\" or the older term \"British West Indies\". There are 6 territories which are sometimes described as Commonwealth Caribbean:\n\nThe United States Virgin Islands is another English-speaking territory in the Caribbean, and Puerto Rico has English as an official language (\"Spanish is the working language however\"), but they're part of the United States, which isn't part of the Commonwealth.\n\nSint Maarten a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is also a majority English-speaking country in the Caribbean, however as with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it isn't apart of the Commonwealth. English is the day-to-day administrative language and language of communication in Sint Maarten, and the first language of the majority (67.5%) of the population.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1962, there was a short-lived federation between several English-speaking Caribbean countries, called the West Indies Federation, which consisted of all the island nations (except the Bahamas), and the territories (excluding Bermuda and British Virgin Islands). British Guiana (Guyana) and British Honduras (Belize) held observer status within the West Indies Federation.\n\nThe Commonwealth Caribbean makes up a composite cricket team. The West Indies cricket team also includes Guyana, as another former British colony. Bermuda, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and the Dutch Caribbean also participate in Anglophone Caribbean-related sports activities such as Twenty20 Cricket.\n\nThe English-speaking parts of the Caribbean established the Caribbean Community in 1973 and it currently includes all the independent English-speaking island countries plus Belize, Guyana and Montserrat, as well as all other British Caribbean territories and Bermuda as associate members. English was its sole official language until 1995 following the addition of Dutch-speaking Suriname.\n\nIn addition to these formally recognised countries, there are substantial communities of Anglo-Caribbean origin along the Atlantic or Caribbean coast of Central America, as a part of the Western Caribbean Zone. These communities, which began forming in the seventeenth century, include areas of Nicaragua and Honduras that made up the Miskito Kingdom which was under British protection after 1740, the Garifuna community which was deported to the coast in 1797 and took up English as its language, and the many and numerous Anglophone Caribbean people who were brought to Central America by the canal companies (the French and American Panama Canal efforts), railroad companies, and particularly the fruit companies, such as United Fruit after the 1870s and particularly in the first decades of the twentieth century. Many have never fully integrated into the otherwise Spanish-speaking communities in which they reside, such as the Caracoles of Honduras.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867159", "title": "Carnival glass", "text": "Carnival glass\n\nCarnival glass is moulded or pressed glass to which an iridescent surface shimmer has been applied. \n\nThe keys to its appeal were that it looked superficially like the much finer and much more expensive blown iridescent glass by Tiffany, Loetz and others and also that the cheerful bright finish caught the light even in dark corners of the home.\n\nBoth functional and ornamental objects were produced in the carnival finish and patterns ranged from simple through geometric and 'cut' styles to pictorial and figurative. A wide range of colours and colour combinations were used but the most common colours accounted for a large proportion of output, so scarce colours can today command very high prices on the collector market. \n\nCarnival glass has been known by many other names in the past: aurora glass, dope glass, rainbow glass, taffeta glass, and disparagingly as 'poor man's Tiffany'. Its current name was adopted by collectors in the 1950s from the fact that it was sometimes given as prizes at carnivals, fetes, and fairgrounds. However, that can be misleading as people tend to think that all of it was distributed in this way but evidence suggests that the vast majority of it was purchased by the housewife to brighten up the home at a time when only the well-off could afford bright electric lighting. \n\nSome carnival glass is still produced today although in very small quantities. At the height of its popularity in the 1920s huge volumes were produced and prices were low enough for the ordinary home to afford. \n\nStarting at the beginning of the 20th century, carnival glass was eventually produced on every continent except Africa and Antarctica but largely and initially in the U.S.. All the major European glass making centres except Italy produced some and it was very popular in Australia.\n\nCarnival glass gets its iridescent sheen from the application of metallic salts while the glass is still hot from the pressing. A final firing of the glass brings out the iridescent properties of the salts, giving carnival glass the distinct shine it is known for.\n\nCarnival glass originated as a glass called 'Iridill', produced beginning in 1908 by the Fenton Art Glass Company (founded in 1905). Iridill was inspired by the fine blown art glass of such makers as Tiffany and Steuben, but did not sell at the anticipated premium prices and was subsequently discounted. After these markdowns, Iridill pieces were used as carnival prizes.\n\nIridill became popular and very profitable for Fenton, which produced many different types of items in this finish, in over 150 patterns. Fenton maintained their position as the largest manufacturer and were one of very few makers to use a red coloured glass base for their carnival glass. After interest waned in the late 1920s, Fenton stopped producing carnival glass for many years. In more recent years, due to a resurgence in interest, Fenton restarted production of carnival glass until its closure in 2007. \n\nMost U.S. carnival glass was made before 1925, with production in clear decline after 1931. Some significant production continued outside the US through the depression years of the early 1930s, tapering off to very little by the 1940s.\n\nOften the same moulds were used to produce clear and transparent coloured glass as well as carnival versions, so producers could switch production between these finishes easily according to demand.\n\nCarnival glass was made in a wide array of colours, shades, colour combinations and variants. More than fifty have been formally classified. These classifications do not go by the surface colours showing, which can be even more varied, but by the 'base' colours of the glass before application of the iridizing mineral salts. \n\nIn order to establish the base colour you have to find an area of the item which had no mineral salts applied, which is usually the base, and hold the item up to the light in such a way that you can see through that area. This is usually easy enough to do, but it can still be difficult for the inexperienced to differentiate the exact base colour between the many possibilities as there are often only subtle differences, as well as variations.\n\nThe final (post doping) surface shades also vary according to the depth of base colour, as well as any special treatments and the type and amount of salts used. This last variable caused significant variation to occur, even between batches of what should have been essentially the same colour or colour-way. This happened most frequently in early production but to such an extent that collectors now differentiate between these items, describing the degree of iridescence showing. \n\nThe most popular colour for carnival glass is now known by collectors as 'marigold' although that name was not in use at the time. Marigold has a clear glass base and is the most easily recognizable carnival colour. The final surface colours of marigold are mostly a bright orange-gold turning perhaps to copper with small areas showing rainbow or 'oil-slick' highlights. The highlights appear mostly on ridges in the pattern and vary in strength according to the light. \n\nMarigold carnival glass is the most frequently found colour and in general commands lower prices in the collector market. However, variants of marigold such as those based on 'moonstone', a translucent white, and 'milk glass', an opaque white base, can be more sought after. Other base colours include; amethyst, a reddish purple; blue, green, red and amber. These basic colours are then further delineated by shade; depth of colour; colour combinations such as 'amberina'; colour pattern such as 'slag'; special treatments such as 'opalescent' and finally luminescence such as that given off by 'vaseline glass' or 'uranium glass' under ultra violet light (blacklight).\n\nCarnival Glass was produced in a wide variety of items, from utilitarian to the purely decorative. Even within groups of items a variety of shapes can be found with further variation in edging and bases as well as different treatments of the basic shape while still malleable fresh from the mould.\nFor example, of three items coming from the same mould, one could be left as is, another folded inwards and the third splayed outwards. Edge styles varied from plain to include frilled after moulding, or pie crust, furrowed or bullet, as a part of the mould pattern. \nThe basic items produced included bowls, plates, vases, jugs or pitchers and tumblers but many other more specialised items of tableware were made also. These included large centre piece items such as jardinières and float bowls as well as smaller useful items such as butter dishes, celery vases and cruet sets. In smaller numbers and less often found are items to do with lighting or associated with smoking and those designed solely for show as ornaments such as figural sculptures or statuettes.\n\nCarnival glass was produced in large quantities in the US by the Fenton, Northwood, Imperial, Millersburg, Westmoreland (also began producing in 1908), Dugan/Diamond, Cambridge, and U.S. Glass companies as well as many smaller manufacturers. Competition became so fierce that new patterns were continually being developed, so each company ended up making a wide range of patterns of most types adding up to a panoply of choice. By selling sample pieces to carnival fair operators, it was hoped that a winner would then go on to purchase further items in the same or a similar pattern. Pressed glass 'blancs' were brought in and iridized by third parties as well.\n\nDifferent and in many cases highly distinctive carnival glass patterns were designed and made by non-US makers, most notably by Crown Crystal of Australia, now famed for their depiction of that continent's distinctive fauna and flora in their glass. Sowerby (England) are notable for their use of swan, hen and dolphin figural pieces in carnival finish as well as pieces which have figural parts such as bird figured legs. There is even a figural boat. Of their non-figural production, the strong, bold and easily recognizable 'African Shield', 'King James' and 'Drape' patterns provided a good canvas for shimmering carnival colours. \n\nGerman production of carnival was dominated by the Brockwitz glassworks, with mainly geometric patterns which take their cues from cut glass. Other major European makers included Inwald (Czechoslovakia), Eda glasbruk (Sweden) and Riihimäki (Finland). These again produced cut glass styles and simple geometrics with a few floral patterns. However, the most distinctive continental European patterns are probably the similarly styled 'Classic Arts' & 'Egyptian Queen', produced by the Czech Rindskopf works, sporting stained bands of figures over a very simple geometric form in a very even marigold. \n\nIn other parts of the world most notable are the Argentinian Cristalerias Rigolleau for their innovative and highly distinctive ash trays and Cristalerias Piccardo for their highly desirable 'Jewelled Peacock Tail' vase. Finally, the Indian Jain company should not go unmentioned, notable for their distinctive elephant, fish and hand figural sections incorporated into the body of trumpet shaped vases and for their desirable and highly complex goddess vases.\n\nCarnival glass is highly collectible. Prices vary widely, with some pieces worth very little, while other, rare items command thousands of dollars. Examples of carnival glass can be easily found in antique stores and eBay.\n\nIdentification of carnival glass is frequently difficult. Many manufacturers did not include a maker's mark on their product, and some did for only part of the time they produced the glass. Identifying carnival glass involves matching patterns, colours, sheen, edges, thickness, and other factors from old manufacturer's trade catalogs, other known examples, or other reference material. Since many manufacturers produced close copies of their rivals' popular patterns, carnival glass identification can be challenging even for an expert.\n\n\n"}

The film was originally going to be titled \" The Naked Gun : Just for the Record\", but was changed after the studio felt that audiences would not get the joke. It was also going to simply be titled \"The Naked Gun 3: The Final Insult\", according to some Christmas 1993 video previews.\n\nLeslie Nielsen returns as Lieutenant Frank Drebin (his original character from \"Police Squad!\"), along with Priscilla Presley as Jane Spencer Drebin, O. J. Simpson (his last film released before the notorious murders and his subsequent trial) as Officer Nordberg and George Kennedy as Captain Ed Hocken. Newcomers to the series Fred Ward, Anna Nicole Smith, and Kathleen Freeman co-star as a gang of bombers set to blow up the Academy Awards ceremony. Raye Birk reprises his role as the villainous \"Pahpshmir\" from \"\".\n\nFrank Drebin has retired from Police Squad and lives a seemingly happy life with his wife, Jane Spencer Drebin. Under the surface, however, Frank is unfulfilled acting as a househusband, and he and Jane attend marriage counseling. Six months after Frank's retirement, he is visited by Ed Hocken and Nordberg, who ask for Frank's help with an investigation. Police Squad has caught wind that infamous bomber Rocco Dillon, who is currently incarcerated, has been hired by terrorists to conduct a major bombing against the United States. Frank remembers Rocco's girlfriend Tanya Peters from an investigation years ago and agrees to help Ed and Nordberg by visiting the clinic where Peters works.\n\nFrank, in disguise, visits the clinic and writes Peters' address on a handkerchief, but loses it before he can give it to Ed and accidentally ends up a repeating sperm donor. Jane comes home to an exhausted Frank and accuses him of doing police work again. Frank lies and swears he is having an affair, but Jane does not believe him and moves out of their house. With nothing else to lose, Frank volunteers to go undercover in prison to befriend Dillon and learn the details of the bombing. Frank is put in Rocco's cell in prison and adopts the name Nick \"The Slasher\" McGuirk. He wins Rocco's trust after protecting their escape plan from a guard and causing a riot. Rocco and Frank escape through a tunnel out of their cell and are picked up on the outside by Rocco's mother Muriel. At Rocco's hideout, Frank attempts to get information on the bombing out of Rocco and his mother, but they are distrustful of him and refuse to tell him the details.\n\nIn the meantime, Jane and her friend Louise are on a road trip together when Jane discovers the handkerchief with Tanya Peters' address on it. Believing Frank was being truthful about the affair, Jane decides to drive cross-country to the address to find Frank. When she arrives, Frank answers the door and must quickly cover for her; he convinces the Dillons that Jane is a random stranger but that they should keep her alive as a hostage. Then Rocco finally reveals his plan to Frank: the bomb is to be set off at the Academy Award ceremony, with the bomb hidden in the envelope with the winner of the Best Picture category and triggered when the card is pulled out.\n\nAt the awards ceremony, Frank traps Muriel in the car and sneaks into the show with Jane to search for the bomb. Frank and Jane separate and frantically begin searching for the bomb, with Frank inflicting his usual chaos on stage during the show. While searching for the bomb backstage, Frank encounters Rocco's busty girlfriend Tanya Peters. She attempts to seduce Frank to distract him from searching for the bomb. As she undresses, her shadow on the wall reveals she has a large penis, causing Frank to become sick to his stomach, ultimately vomiting in the tuba of the orchestra. They are unable to find the bomb before the Best Picture winner is to be announced. Frank bursts onto the stage and awkwardly tries to prevent the detonation of the bomb, but ends up in a stalemate with Rocco. Frank manages to drop an electronic sign which takes out Muriel. A desperate Rocco decides to detonate the bomb to follow his mother, but Frank manages to catapult Rocco and the bomb offstage into the catwalks above. Frank snares Rocco with a rubber cable and slings him through the roof of the arena with the bomb pulled out. Rocco crashes into Pahpshmir's private helicopter hovering overhead, and the bomb explodes, killing both. Frank and Jane reaffirm their love under the applause of the awarding audience and viewers worldwide.\n\nNine months later, Frank and Nordberg rush into the obstetric ward to witness the birth of Frank's child, but run into the wrong delivery room. Seeing that the baby is African-American, Frank assumes Nordberg is responsible and angrily chases him. Just after they leave, Ed comes out of another hospital room with Jane, who is holding their real baby.\n\n\nThis is the only film in the series to be directed by Peter Segal, rather than David Zucker, who instead received credit for writing the screenplay. Similar to the previous entry in the series, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker did not write the film's script, but both returned as executive producers and received writing credits due to their contributions to \"Police Squad!\" and the .\n\nSeveral scenes had been planned for the earlier films but cut out. The opening sequence had been planned for the first film. The scene where Frank and Jane get married, then drive off with Nordberg on the back of the car, was shot for the second film. In the latter, the car being driven is the electric car featured in the second film.\n\nIn the opening scene at the train station, the woman with the baby carriage who is assisted by Frank Drebin is played by Susan Breslau, the sister of Jerry and David Zucker.\n\nThe dream sequence parodies the train-station shoot-out from the 1987 film \"The Untouchables\", which is itself a homage to the \"Odessa Steps\" montage in Sergei Eisenstein's famous 1925 silent movie \"Battleship Potemkin\".\n\nDirector Peter Segal, in addition to playing the producer of \"Sawdust and Mildew\", also has several minor roles in the film (mostly in voiceover):\n\nThe film made over $51 million in the United States and Canada and $122 million worldwide. However, this would be the lowest-grossing film of the \"Naked Gun\" series. Still, \"\" managed to grab the No. 1 weekend box office title in the U.S. during its opening weekend (the other \"Naked Guns\" did as well).\n\n\"Naked Gun : The Final Insult\" received mixed reviews from critics. The film holds a 54% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Naked Gun : The Final Insult\" can't help but be sporadically funny thanks to Leslie Nielsen's dependably solid work, but it's still a steep comedown from the original.\"\n\nPeter Rainer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the opening sequence, which parodied \"The Untouchables\", and the climax at the Academy Awards, but felt the middle was uninspired, and that the film overall had too little plotting and relied too much on comedy without the romantic or action elements of the previous films. Others felt that the humor was weak and too similar to that of the previous films. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, the same rating he gave to \"\".\n\nThe movie won two Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Supporting Actor for O.J. Simpson and Worst New Star for Anna Nicole Smith.\n\nNumerous celebrities have cameo appearances in the film, both in credited and uncredited roles.\n\nAs themselves:\n\n\nAs minor characters:\n\nAn image used on the promotional poster for the film parodies a famous portrait photograph by Annie Leibovitz which was featured on the magazine.

The doctrine established a \"spiritual marriage\" of church officials to their church; in order to better serve God, one had to disavow the demands and temptations of traditional marriage. This rule was enforced by Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, whose marriage to Cunigunde of Luxemburg was also a very famous spiritual marriage.\n\nSaints Louis and Zélie Martin professed to enter a spiritual marriage, but consummated a year later when directed by their confessor to do so. Of their nine children the five who survived to adulthood all became nuns, including Saint Thérèse de Lisieux. \n\nOccasionally, spiritual marriages may also be entered later in life, with the renunciation of sexual relations after raising a family to fully dedicate oneself to God. In October 2001, John Paul II beatified a married couple, Luigi Beltrame Quattrocchi and Maria Corsini, who bore four children, but later in life lived separately and committed to a Josephite marriage.\n\n"}

He was twice world professional road race champion, and was the first cyclist to win all five 'Monuments': the most prestigious one-day classics – a feat since achieved by just two others (both also Belgians: Roger De Vlaeminck and Eddy Merckx). With 379 road victories he's second to Merckx only. He is ninth on the all-time list of Grand Tour stage winners with thirty-seven victories.\n\nVan Looy rose to prominence when he won the Belgian amateur road championship in 1952. He repeated the victory the following year, adding third place in the world title race the same year, before turning professional. At the 1952 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal in the team road race event.\n\nA powerful sprinter, Van Looy won two races in what was left of his first professional season (1953), and 20 more over the next couple of seasons. In 1956, his victories included Gent–Wevelgem and Paris–Brussels, plus two stages and overall victory in the Tour of the Netherlands. He also won a silver medal in the world road race championship, behind his countryman Rik Van Steenbergen. He repeated his Gent–Wevelgem and Tour of the Netherlands victories in 1957, and in 1958 won the season's opening classic, Milan–San Remo.\n\n1959 saw Van Looy take the early-season Tour of Flanders and the autumn classic, the Giro di Lombardia. In between, he scored another 38 victories, including three stages of the Vuelta a España (finishing third overall and winner of the points competition) and four stages of the Giro d'Italia (for 4th overall).\n\nIn 1960, he scored the first of two consecutive victories in the world road race championship, but Classic victories eluded him. However, he made up for this in 1961, winning both Paris–Roubaix and Liège–Bastogne–Liège – making him the first rider to take all five 'Monuments' – as well as retaining his rainbow world title jersey, and taking three stages, plus the mountains competition, in the Giro.\n\nVan Looy scored two more Classic wins in 1962 (Paris–Roubaix, Tour of Flanders), took another Gent–Wevelgem, and two more Giro stages. In 1963 Van Looy rode the Tour de France, taking four stages en route to victory in the points competition and a 10th place on general classification; he also grabbed a silver in the world title race. In the latter race, held in Ronse in his native Belgium, he was beaten in the sprint by his countryman Benoni Beheyt. Van Looy, starting the sprint too early, did not take this defeat lightly. This race has remained memorable in the history of Belgian cycling.\n\nIn 1965, he scored 42 victories including Paris–Roubaix, and eight stages of the Vuelta on his way to his second third place overall (his highest placing in a Grand Tour). For good measure, he also took two stages in the Tour de France.\n\nDuring the final years of his career (1966–1970), Van Looy's road performances began to fade, as the new Belgian star Eddy Merckx rose to prominence, but he still grabbed second in the 1967 Paris–Roubaix, won La Flèche Wallonne in 1968, and took a stage of the 1969 Tour de France. His rivalry with Eddy Merckx reached the height of sabotage of Merckx in the world championships in 1969.\n\nVan Looy was also a star on the track, winning 11 Six-day races. His first came in Brussels in 1957, his last in Antwerp in 1968. For nine of these victories, he was paired with Dutchman Peter Post.\n"}

It nominated former Vice President Richard M. Nixon for president and Maryland Governor Spiro T. Agnew for vice president. It was the fourth time Nixon had been nominated on the Republican ticket as either its vice presidential (1952 and 1956) or presidential candidate (1960).\n\nFormer Vice President Richard M. Nixon, emerged as the frontrunner again for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. Nixon had been the Republican Party nominee in the 1960 presidential election, and lost to Democratic Party candidate John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe so-called \"New Nixon\" in the 1968 presidential election devised a \"Southern strategy,\" taking advantage of the region's opposition to racial integration and other progressive/liberal policies of the Democratic Party and President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nNixon decided not to re-select his 1960 running mate Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., and House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford of Michigan proposed New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay for vice president. Nixon turned instead to another perceived moderate, Maryland Governor Spiro T. Agnew. Agnew, former Baltimore County Executive in the Baltimore City suburbs (1963–1967), and since Governor of Maryland, had come to Republican leaders and Nixon's attention when he summoned several Black civic, religious, and political leaders in Baltimore to the local State Office Building complex, following the disastrous April 1968 urban riots which enveloped Black sections of East and West Baltimore in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee. Agnew complained of the Black leaders' lack of support after a number of what he perceived to be positive projects, programs and support by his Republican administration for the minority communities in the city.

Records. It was recorded at eleven shows throughout 1998 and 1999, including Cornerstone 1999. The cover art was made by Douglas TenNapel.\n\nIn Five Iron's typical fashion \"Proof\" contains the band's humour. \"A New Hope\" ends with the song \"Kingdom of the Dinosaurs\", the hidden track after the end of \"Every New Day\" features various slip-ups recorded over the tour, and the title itself has a double meaning. The word \"Revolting\" is used to mean \"disgusting\", or \"starting a revolution\". The revolution referred to, however, is one of the heart. According to Keith Hoerig this is \"... a personal revolution that each individual partakes in the choices they make and the way they live their lives.\"\n\nThe album contains a number of cover songs and references to other bands. The band fully covers Tom Jones \"It's Not Unusual\" and \"Receive Him\" by the Christian metal group Vengeance Rising. The introductory track makes a reference to Stryper's album \"To Hell with the Devil\". \"Superpowers\" integrates The Cure's \"Close to Me\" in the lead, and \"One Girl Army\" begins with a cover of Europe's \"The Final Countdown\".\n\nWhile \"Proof\" was designed to consist of fan favorites, it also marks the first appearance of \"A New Hope.\" \"A New Hope\" was written about the Columbine High School massacre, which affected some members of the band on a personal level. The band often practiced at Micah Ortega's house, about a five-minute walk from the school, and his sister attended there at the time of the shootings.\n\nFor those who attended any of the concerts which were recorded to be potentially used as this live album, the band had pieces of paper at their merchandise booth where one could sign up to be registered as a \"backup singer.\" While the final album used cuts from a variety of shows, all the people who filled out their names were mentioned in a large fold-out booklet that went with the album, listed under the title \"backup singers.\" In total about 7,000 names were listed.\n\n-Hidden Track-\n\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n"}

At the age of 18 he signed for A.C. Milan in 1990, Élber went almost unnoticed during his one-year spell with the Serie A side. Subsequently, he moved to Switzerland with Grasshopper Club Zürich, initially on loan. He immediately started showing displays of offensive talent at his new club, namely in a 1992–93 UEFA Cup tie against Sporting Clube de Portugal where, after a 1–2 home loss, he was influential in the club's 4–3 aggregate win, scoring twice.\n\nAfter more than 50 official goals for Grasshoppers, Élber signed with VfB Stuttgart of Germany in the 1994 summer. He scored in his Bundesliga debut, a 2–1 home win against Hamburger SV, and finished his debut season with eight goals, which would be the only campaign he netted in single digits for the following seven years.\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, Élber netted 20 official goals for Stuttgart, 17 in the league, and three in the cup, including both against FC Energie Cottbus in the final (2–0 win). At Stuttgart he formed the so-called \"magic triangle\" (German: \"Magisches Dreieck\") with Krassimir Balakov and Fredi Bobic. The following summer, he moved to fellow league team FC Bayern Munich where, save for one year, he was always crowned the club's top scorer (Carsten Jancker prevented that honour); additionally, he was instrumental in the conquest of four leagues, the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League and the 2001 Intercontinental Cup, whilst winning the \"Torjägerkanone\" award for 2002–03 with 21 goals; the Bavarians won the double.\n\nThirty-one-year-old Élber then spent the vast majority of the 2003–04 campaign (played four matches with Bayern) in France with Olympique Lyonnais, replacing compatriot Sonny Anderson who had left for Spain. He helped the club to the third of its seven consecutive Ligue 1 accolades, but then suffered a severe fibula and tibia injury which put him out of action for more than one year. He made his comeback to professional football in Germany with Borussia Mönchengladbach, whom he joined in January 2005.\n\nIn January 2006, after nearly 15 years of absence, Élber returned to his country, finishing his career at Cruzeiro Esporte Clube. After an emotional announcement, he retired from the club three rounds before the end of the season on 9 September, after injuries and the loss of his father.\n\nDue to stiff competition, Élber could not translate his club form to the Brazilian national team. In his first year of international play, 1998, he scored six goals in as many games, but would only collect nine more caps in the following three years.\n\nIn the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship, Élber scored four in six matches as the under-20s lost to hosts Portugal, on penalties.\n\nAfter announcing his retirement he then returned to Bayern, where he began working for the club as a scout, searching in his country for young talents.\n\nÉlber works as a pundit for German television station Das Erste. He provided expert analysis during the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and reappeared in this capacity during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nHe is mostly referred to as \"Giováne Élber\" (sometimes also mistakenly as \"Giovanni Élber\"), which is a German variation of his Italian nickname \"il giòvane Élber\" (\"the young Élber\").\n\nGrasshoppers\n\nStuttgart\n\nBayern Munich\n\nLyon\n\nCruzeiro\n\n\n"}

Early walkways consisted of bridges between trees in the canopy of a forest; mostly linked up with platforms inside or around the trees. They were originally intended as access to the upper regions of ancient forests for scientists conducting canopy research. Eventually, because they provided only limited, one-dimensional access to the trees, they were abandoned for canopy cranes. Today they serve as ecotourism attractions in places such as Dhlinza Forest, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Taman Negara National Park, Malaysia, Sedim River, Kulim, Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda and Kakum National Park, Ghana.\n\nCanopy or treetop walkways are especially popular attractions in Australia.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game. The main character, Malvineous Havershim, must journey through strange landscapes as he seeks to destroy the evil Xargon.\n\nThe basic goal of \"Xargon\" is to advance through the map by completing levels. To finish a level, the player must find and reach the exit, which is found by traversing throughout the level.\n\nInitially, Malvineous is armed with a \"laser bullet\", allowing only one shot on-screen at a time which can be controlled by pressing up or down, in which the laser bullet will slightly advance upwards or downwards. Other weapons include more laser bolts which allows Malvineous to shoot more often, rapid fire, rocks which can be thrown more strategically, and powerful fireballs which destroy every enemy in their path.\n\n\"Xargon\" is unique in the sense that the player can purchase items at any point during the game. Emeralds are randomly placed in most levels. Purchasable items include health units, invincibility, and weapon upgrades.\n\nIn most of the levels there are gift boxes, that either explode when shot or contain fruit, other valuable items or nothing. Points are earned by collecting fruit, killing monsters, and collecting the four EPIC pool balls. More points are earned if the EPIC pool balls are collected in order.\n\nMalvineous can take 5 hits, and if he dies the player must start the level over again. His health can be restored by collecting a beating heart or collecting 16 fruits which restores one health unit or purchasing a health unit. Spike pits, water, acid and various other dangers kill Malvineous instantly if he touches them.\n\nMalvineous Havershim is an archaeologist studying strange ruins in Madagascar. The ruins were built by an unknown ancient culture known as the 'Blue Builders'. While attempting to translate the glyphs on the walls of one Blue Builder structure, a strange gas is emitted, and Malvineous loses consciousness. Malvineous has a dream-encounter with a talking eagle, who gives him cryptic warnings. He awakes in a strange land, the area in which the game takes place.\n\n\"Xargon\", produced and released by Epic MegaGames 1993, was programmed by Allen Pilgrim. The graphics were created by Joe Hitchens, who also contributed to \"Epic Pinball\" and \"Jill of the Jungle\". Volume One: Beyond Reality was released as shareware, but Volume Two: The Secret Chamber and Volume Three: Xargon's Fury had to be purchased commercially. The game was a contemporary of such games as Id Software's \"Commander Keen\" and Apogee Software's \"Duke Nukem II\".\n\nAllen Pilgrim declared the registered version freeware and released the source code on August 4, 2008. Following that, ports with SDL to new platforms and mobile devices like the Pandora were created.\n\nXargon was ranked #3 out of the \"Los Angeles Times\" top five games on May 7, 1994, after just four months on the market, behind \"Doom\" and \"Epic Pinball\" and above \"Duke Nukem 2\". It remained for three weeks.\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1994 in \"Dragon\" #204 by Sandy Petersen in the \"Eye of the Monitor\" column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars. \"Computer Gaming World\" in July 1994 said that \"Xargon: Beyond Reality\" \"is an attractive, high energy\" game that was better than \"Jill of the Jungle\", and recommended it to fans of the latter, \"Bio Menace\", or \"Duke Nukem\".\n\n"}

Each chain is mounted with useful household appendages such as scissors, thimbles, watches, keys, vinaigrette, and household seals.\n\nAncient Roman women wore chatelaines with ear scoops, nail cleaners, and tweezers. Women in Roman Britain wore 'chatelaine brooches' from which toilet sets were suspended.\n\nThe remnants of chatelaines and chatelaine bags have been found in the graves of females in the seventh and eighth century in the United Kingdom. Often found with the chatelaine artifacts would be wire rings, beads, buckles, knives and tools.\n\nChatelaine bags refer to bags suspended from a waistband by cord or chain, which were popular from the 1860s to the end of the 19th century.\n\nChatelaines were worn by many housekeepers in the 19th century and in the 16th century Dutch Republic, where they were typically used as watch chains for the most wealthy. Similar jewelry was also worn by Anglo-Saxon women, as seen from the burial record, but their function is uncertain. The name chatelaine derives from the French term \"châtelaine\" and was originally used disparagingly, as it referred to a device designed to have all the tools necessary for the woman of the household to sort out any problem she may encounter in her day, like a fraying curtain.\n\nThe chatelaine was also used as a woman's keychain in the 19th century to show the status of women in a household. The woman with the keys to all the many desks, chest of drawers, food hampers, pantries, storage containers, and many other locked cabinets was \"the woman of the household\". As such, she was the one who would direct the servants, housemaids, cooks and delivery servicemen and would open or lock the access to the valuables of the house, possessing total authority over who had access to what.\nFrequently, this hostess was the senior woman of the house. When a woman married and moved into her father-in-law's house, her husband's mother would usually hold on to the keys. However, if the mother became a widow, the keys and their responsibilities and status were often passed to the oldest son's wife.\nYounger women and daughters in the house often wanted the appearance of this responsibility, and would often wear decorative chatelaines with a variety of small objects in the place of keys, especially bright and glittering objects that could be used to start a conversation.\nIn the case of the absence of a woman of the house, the controller of the keys was often a hired housekeeper.\n\n"}

Supporters included the former MP Martin Bell who in his book, \"The Truth that Sticks\" (2007) wrote \"Of great value was Derek Cattell, formerly on the executive of Sedgefield Labour Party. He defected to Reg's campaign after some heart searching; it cost him some fair weather friends, but the candidate had no loyal supporter from start to finish.\" (page 103)\nClay went on to live in the Marches city of Hereford and remains politically active as a volunteer official in the local Labour Party. He has involved himself in a number of local causes including a group opposed to the building of a by-pass which would disturb ancient archaeological remains known as The Dinedor Serpent.\nHe now lives in the Llansamlet ward of Swansea East, where on 4 July 2013 he was elected, in a by election, as a Labour Party councillor for the City and County of Swansea Council. His wife, Uta Clay, served as a councillor for the same council but both stood down at the 2017 election.\n"}

Her biggest hit as a singer was \"Love Makes a Woman\" (1968). As a songwriter, she is best known for co-writing the multi-million-selling \"Have You Seen Her\" (1971) with Eugene Record, lead singer of the Chi-Lites.\n\nAcklin was born in Oakland, California and moved with her family to Chicago, Illinois in 1948. She was encouraged to sing as a child; by the age of 11, she sang regularly as a soloist at the New Zion Baptist Church and as a teenager started singing at nightclubs in Chicago. After graduating from Dunbar Vocational High School she worked as a secretary at St. Lawrence Records. Her first record was released on the subsidiary Special Agent label, under the pseudonym Barbara Allen, and was produced by her cousin, producer, and saxophonist Monk Higgins. She also worked as a backing singer at Chess Records on recordings by Fontella Bass, Etta James, Koko Taylor, and others produced by Higgins.\n\nIn 1966, she started working as a receptionist at Brunswick Records' Chicago office, where she submitted demo recordings of some of her own songs to producer Carl Davis. One of her songs, \"Whispers (Gettin' Louder)\", which she had co-written with David Scott, formerly of The Five Du-Tones, was recorded by Jackie Wilson and became his biggest hit for three years, reaching no. 5 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart and no. 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Wilson then helped secure her a recording contract with Brunswick. Her first two singles for the label were unsuccessful but her third, \"Show Me the Way To Go\", a duet with Gene Chandler, made the R&B chart. She began writing songs with another Brunswick recording artist, Eugene Record, lead singer of the Chi-Lites; some but not all sources state that they were later married. They co-wrote the Peaches and Herb hit \"Two Little Kids\", before Record and Davis co-wrote and produced Acklin's first and biggest solo hit, \"Love Makes a Woman\"; the other co-writers were arranger Sonny Sanders and guitarist Gerald Sims. The single reached no. 3 on the R&B chart and no. 15 on the US pop chart in July 1968, and won a BMI award.\n\nAcklin continued to have a series of hits on Brunswick over the next four years, including \"From the Teacher to the Preacher\", another duet with Chandler, and solo hits \"Just Ain't No Love\" and \"Am I the Same Girl\", produced by Record. The instrumental backing track of \"Am I the Same Girl\", with piano replacing Acklin's vocal, became a bigger hit when released as \"Soulful Strut\" by Young-Holt Unlimited. \"Am I the Same Girl\" was successfully covered by Swing Out Sister in 1992, and in the UK by Dusty Springfield (UK no. 43, 1969). Acklin also released several albums on the Brunswick label: \"Love Makes a Woman\" (1968), \"Seven Days of Night\" (1969), \"Someone Else's Arms\" (1970), \"I Did It\" (1971), and \"I Call It Trouble\" (1973).\n\nAt the same time, she continued her successful writing partnership with Eugene Record. Impressed by the monologues on Isaac Hayes' album \"Hot Buttered Soul\" (1969), Record and Acklin wrote \"Have You Seen Her\", which was originally an album track on the Chi-Lites' album \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People\" (1971) before being released as a single. It reached no. 1 on the R&B chart and no. 3 on the US pop chart, and twice made the UK top ten (no. 3 in 1972 and no. 5 in 1975). In 1990, the song became a top ten hit again, when recorded by MC Hammer. Record and Acklin co-wrote several other successful songs for the Chi-Lites, including \"Stoned Out of My Mind\" (R&B no. 2, 1973), \"Toby\" (R&B no. 7, 1974), and \"Too Good To Be Forgotten\" (UK no. 10, 1975).\n\nIn 1974, Acklin moved to Capitol Records. Her first single for the label, \"Raindrops\", was co-written by Acklin and produced by former Brunswick producer, Willie Henderson. It became her biggest hit on the R&B chart for six years (#14), and she released an album, \"A Place in the Sun\". However, later recordings met with less success and she was dropped by the label in 1975.\n\nShe continued to tour as a solo artist and as a backing singer for the Chi-Lites, Tyrone Davis, and other acts. In 1980, she made some recordings for Carl Davis' Chi-Sound label and contributed backing vocals to Otis Clay's album \"The Gospel Truth\" (1993). Acklin later lived in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nShe had begun recording a new album in 1998, when she fell ill and died from pneumonia at the age of 55. She was survived by her son, Marcus White, her daughter, Samotta Acklin, and her godson, Elliot Myrick.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867272", "title": "Forest dynamics", "text": "Forest dynamics\n\nForest dynamics describes the underlying physical and biological forces that shape and change a forest ecosystem. The continuous state of change in forests can be summarized with two basic elements: disturbance and succession.\n\nForest disturbances are events that cause change in the structure and composition of a forest ecosystem, beyond the growth and death of individual organisms. Disturbances can vary in frequency and intensity, and include natural disasters such as fire, landslides, wind, volcanic eruptions, rare meteor impacts, outbreaks of insects, fungi, and other pathogens, animal-caused effects such as grazing and trampling, and anthropogenic disturbances such as warfare, logging, pollution, the clearing of land for urbanization or agriculture, and the introduction of invasive species. Not all disturbances are destructive or negative to the overall forest ecosystem. Many natural disturbances allow for renewal and growth and often release necessary nutrients.\n\nSmall-scale disturbances are the key to creating and maintaining diversity and heterogeneity within a forest. Small-scale disturbances are events such as single-tree blowdowns, which create gaps that let light through the canopy to the understory and forest floor. This available light allows early-successional shade-intolerant species to colonize and maintain a population within the dominant forest, leading to the complex spatial mosaic forest structure recognized as old-growth. This process is referred to as patch dynamics or gap dynamics and has been described across many types of forests, including tropical, temperate, and boreal.\n\nThe sets and patterns of natural disturbances that characterize a particular area or ecosystem are referred to as the ecosystem's \"disturbance regime\". A natural community is closely linked with its natural disturbance regime. For example, temperate and boreal rainforests typically have a disturbance regime consisting of high-frequency but small-scale events, resulting in a highly complex forest dominated by very old trees. In contrast, forests that have a disturbance regime consisting of high-severity stand-replacing events, such as frequent fires, tend to be more uniform in structure and have relatively young tree stands.\n\nForest succession is the process by which species recover and regenerate after a disturbance. The type of disturbance, the climate and weather conditions, the presence of colonizing species, and the interactions among species all influence the path that succession will take.\nSpecies diversity and composition fluctuate throughout succession. The classic model of succession is known as \"relay floristics\" and refers to a relay of dominant species. After a stand-replacing disturbance, shade-intolerant species colonize and grow into a dominant canopy, but due to their shade-intolerance they are unable to regenerate under their own canopy; the understory (composed of shade-tolerant species) gradually replaces the canopy, and due to its shade-tolerance it can regenerate under its own canopy and therefore becomes the dominant species.\nOften succession is not so complete or directed as the relay floristics model describes. Species can be mid-tolerant of shade and survive by taking advantage of small amounts of light coming through the canopy, and further disturbances can create small gaps. These and other factors can lead to a mixture of dominant species and a not so obvious “end” to succession (climax community).\n\nMany successional trajectories follow a basic four-stage development pattern. The first of these stages, \"stand initiation\", occurs after a major disturbance and involves many species arriving in the area of abundant light and nutrients. The second stage, \"stem exclusion\", describes the growth and competition of these species as resources become less available; likely one or a few species outcompetes and becomes stand-dominating. The third stage, \"understory reinitiation\", involves further disturbance and the creation of gaps; at this point stratification develops, with layers of canopy, midstory, and understory appearing. The final stage, known as \"old-growth\", is the extension and completion of the understory reinititation; a complex multi-aged and multi-layered forest has developed.\n\nForests are sensitive to climate, and so climate change can have a great effect on the dynamics of the ecosystem. Rising carbon dioxide levels can increase the productivity and growth of trees, which will then decrease as other nutrients become limiting. Changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the success of various species and the resulting species assemblage. Many factors of climate change can also affect an ecosystem’s disturbance regime, making the forest more or less susceptible to different disturbances and altering or even preventing recovery after a disturbance.\n\nForests offer many ecosystem services including timber, fresh water, carbon storage, and areas of recreation. To conserve these services, along with the natural habitat and biodiversity that forests provide, understanding the dynamics that are creating and maintaining the forests is a priority. Forestry and silviculture operations require a thorough comprehension of forest dynamics in order to implement effective management and conservation techniques.\n"}

{"id": "1867317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867317", "title": "Fort St. Vrain Generating Station", "text": "Fort St. Vrain Generating Station\n\nFort Saint Vrain Generating Station is a natural gas powered electricity generating facility located near the town of Platteville in northern Colorado in the United States. It currently has a capacity of just under 1000MW and is owned and operated by Xcel Energy, the successor to the plant's founder, the Public Service Company of Colorado. It went online in this form in 1996.\n\nThe facility was built originally as a nuclear power plant. It operated as a nuclear generating power plant from 1979 until 1989.\n\nFort Saint Vrain Generating Station was built as Colorado's first and only nuclear power plant, which operated from 1979 until 1989. It was one of two high temperature gas cooled (HTGR) power reactors in the United States. The primary coolant helium transferred heat to a water secondary coolant system to drive steam generators. The reactor fuel was a combination of fissile uranium and fertile thorium microspheres dispersed within a prismatic graphite matrix. The reactor had an electrical power output of 330MW (330 MW), generated from a thermal power 842 MW (842 MW).\n\nThe Fort St. Vrain HTGR power plant was proposed in March 1965 and its application was filed with the Atomic Energy Commission in October 1966. Construction began in September 1968. The HTGR design was safer than typical boiling water designs of the time having steel-reinforced, pre-stressed concrete containment dome structures. It only needed a steel-frame containment structure, while the reactor core was partially contained within a prestressed concrete reactor pressure vessel (PCRV). The construction cost reached $200 million, or approximately $0.60/installed watt. Initial testing began in 1972 and the first commercial power was distributed in July 1979.\n\nThe plant was technically successful, especially towards the very end of its operating life, but was a commercial disappointment to its owner. As one of the first commercial HTGR designs, the plant was a proof-of-concept for several advanced technologies, but had a number of early adopter problems that required expensive corrections. Maintenance problems exacerbated these and other issues.\n\nThe Fort St. Vrain HTGR was substantially more efficient than modern light water reactors, reaching a thermal efficiency of 39-40%, excellent for a steam-cycle power plant. Operation of the HTGR design could be readily attenuated to follow the electrical power demand load, rather than be required to generate its nameplate power all the time. The reactor was also comparatively fuel efficient, with a maximum burn up of 90,000 MW days thermal (compared to Light Water Reactors with burn ups of 10,000 - 40,concept for the future. However, the problems that occurred leading to its debugging led to its early demise.\n\nMany issues occurred early in the operational experience of the Fort St. Vrain HTGR. Although these issues were never a threat to the facility or to public safety, considerable stress was placed upon the personnel, equipment, and facilities and made continued operation appear uneconomical to the plant's owner. Most of the past issues had been resolved at considerable expense and the plant was beginning to perform at a commercially viable level when an economic downturn and the history of the plant caused the owner to shut it down even though it had not reached the end of its design lifetime.\n\nThree major categories of problems were experienced at Fort St. Vrain: first, water infiltration and corrosion issues; second, electrical system issues; and third, general facility issues.\n\nFort St. Vrain's largest problem was with the helium circulator. Helium's smaller molecules required very tight seals to prevent the gas from escaping. Some seals involved moving surfaces, and a water-lubricated bearing design was used to contain the helium. A gas cleaning system was provided to remove contaminants, including water, from the helium system. Design problems resulted in too much water in the helium system, leading to corrosion.\n\nThe designers had intended for the water injectors to maintain pressure in the bearings about equal to the gas pressure in the system. In practice, the gas pressure varied more than expected, allowing excessive water to escape into the circulator.\n\nThe capacity of the gas cleaning system did not account for the excess water from the bearings, and assumed that high-temperature reactions in the graphite reactor core would reduce the impact of residual water in the helium, based on the porosity of typical core graphite. The graphite used to construct Fort St. Vrain's core was higher grade and less porous, and thus did not present as much surface area for these reactions to occur.\n\nAlthough system safety was not compromised, frequent operation problems were experienced throughout the reactor systems due to water and corrosion. Ice formed on chiller units in the gas cleaning system, reducing their efficiency. When the reactor output was cycled down and the system cooled, water would condense on equipment and instruments within the helium system. Control rod drives rusted, and rapid shutdowns failed to operate correctly. The reserve shutdown system, which released borated graphite spheres into the core in the event of an Anticipated Transient Without SCRAM (ATWS), was sometimes unavailable because water had leached the boron to form boric acid, which softened the graphite spheres and caused them to clump together. Steel \"tendons\" within the PCRV experienced corrosion due to chloride precipitation and were weakened. Rust flecks migrated into the coolant and lodged in critical machinery, including control rod drives. Steam generator leaks also occurred due to corrosion.\n\nThe design problems which led to the corrosion were partially the fault of the regulators, who were focused heavily on chemical reactions of steam with the high-grade core graphite and the impact on the gas cleaning system. It was arguable that the memorandums from Rockville, Maryland consumed excessive engineering resources and other design considerations had been overlooked as a result. Some of the blame for the corrosion problems also fell on the owner of FSV and its operations and maintenance procedures. For example, moisture alarms had generated alerts for months in critical parts of the plant, but these were disregarded as defective. Staff later sent to remove the allegedly-defective moisture alarms for repair discovered that the moisture alarms were not defective, and substantial amounts of water were sometimes released when the devices were removed from their fittings. \n\nFinally,the designers of the plant shared responsibility for not sizing the gas cleaning system to cope with excess water in the helium system, as they should have foreseen a possibility of excess water infiltration. They acknowledged this in hindsight: \"The FSV circulators have 'met all design specifications', however, the bearings, seals, and support systems for the water-lubricated bearing have caused many problems. Further, the circulators employed a steam turbine drive that adds complexity to system operations. These unique design features resulted in water ingress to the core, the primary reason for poor plant availability.\"\n\nThe plant electrical system was challenged on numerous occasions, and the resolutions were frequently expensive. Transformers experienced faults. Backup generators sometimes failed to engage when activated, and on other occasions, side channel issues occurred during operation, preventing them from generating power. Failure of backup power also led to some of the moisture infiltration problems, by variously disrupting the logic of the bearing water injection systems and the helium circulator trip logic. Failures of transformers and consequent failure of backup power occurred on at least one occasion due to moisture infiltration into electric cables and subsequent ground faulting when the plant was at low power to remove water from previous moisture infiltration issues. It is believed that this electrical fault led to further moisture infiltration.\n\nFacility contractors introduced safety concerns on several occasions. In one of the more serious incidents, contractor personnel damaged hydraulic units, allowing hydraulic fluid to spray over reactor control cables. The same crew then performed welding operations to equipment located above the control cables. Hot slag fell onto the material used to contain the hydraulic fluid and ignited it, along with the fluid on the control cables. The fire involved the cables for five minutes, and 16 essential control cables were damaged. The contractor personnel then failed to inform plant personnel of the situation and the reactor was in operation for several hours in this condition. On another occasion, contractor personnel using improperly grounded welding apparatuses tripped neutron protection circuits, leading to a nuisance trip of the entire plant.\n\nDue to the water-induced corrosion problems and electrical problems, plant shutdowns were common. As a result, Public Service Company of Colorado began to question the economics of continued commercial operation. An increase in performance was observed from 1987–1989, suggesting some of the problems had been worked out of the system, but Public Service was not persuaded. In 1989 Public Service indicated that the plant was under consideration for closure. Later that same year a critical part of the reactor was found to have long-term corrosion and required replacement. The replacement cost was deemed excessive and the plant was shut down. The decommissioning and removal of the fuel was completed by 1992. Fort St. Vrain thus became the first commercial-scale nuclear reactor in the US to be decommissioned.\n\nLessons learned at Fort St. Vrain have led more recent reactor designs of the HTGR type to adopt different strategies to confront issues that occurred there. More recent HTGR designs have tended to avoid large per-unit cores (in favor of more compact modular units), tended to avoid concrete reactor pressure vessels (in favor of proven carbon or alloy steel reactor pressure vessels), and tended to avoid steam cycles without an intermediate non-water based circuit between the core and the steam generators. Others, such as the Adams Atomic Engine (using nitrogen), the Romawa Nereus (using helium), and General Atomics GT-MHR (using helium) have favored simplification of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor concept as much as possible, down to practically a reactor and a gas turbine linked together with the reactor using a right-sized, inherently safe core with no water used in the plant design. The GT-MHR, however, is large enough that it has a system for residual heat removal using convected air.\n\nThe reactor concept of Fort St. Vrain experienced a resurrection in form of AREVA's Antares reactor. This is a high temperature \nhelium cooled modular reactor and thus is conceptually similar to the reactor at Fort St. Vrain. \nThe INL approved AREVA's Allegro reactor as the chosen Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant(NGNP) to be deployed as prototype by 2021.\n\nFollowing the reactor decommissioning, Fort St. Vrain was converted to a combustion facility. The first natural gas combustion turbine was installed in 1996. Two more turbines were installed by 2001. Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) allow the plant to operate in combined-cycle mode, in which waste heat recovered from combustion-turbine exhaust gases is used to make a second stage of steam capable of driving the facility's original steam turbine and generator. As of 2011, the nameplate generating capacity of the plant is 965MW.\n\n"}

From this fund claims, loans, etc., are paid. Profits after deductions are shared among the members. The institution is intended to provide a safe place for individual members to save and to invest those savings in mortgages, loans, stocks, bonds and other securities and to share in any profits or losses that result. The members own the business.\n\nThe institution most frequently identified as the first modern savings bank was the \"Savings and Friendly Society\" organized by the Reverend Henry Duncan in 1810, in Ruthwell, Scotland. Rev. Duncan established the small bank in order to encourage his working class congregation to develop thrift. Another precursor of modern savings banks were the ideas Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen that led to rural credit unions and cooperative banks. European voluntary organizations and \"friendly societies\" provided the inspiration for their state incorporated American counterparts.\n\nThese first savings banks were envisioned as philanthropic endeavors, designed to uplift the poor and working classes. The banks were started by philanthropists, who took on the positions of savings bank trustees, managers, and directors as opportunities to teach the working class the virtues of thrift, and self-reliance by allowing them the security to save their money. The first incorporated US mutual savings bank was the Provident Institution for Savings, in Boston. Its 1816 charter was the first government legislation in the world to safeguard savings banks. In 2015, the oldest (and largest) mutual bank in the U.S. is Eastern Bank of Boston, with approximately $10 billion in assets. It was chartered in 1818 in Salem, Massachusetts as the Salem Savings Bank.\n\nSince the 1970s, when the industry was deregulated, thousands of mutual savings banks have been converted into stock ownership companies, raising more than $40 billion. In 2010, only about 600 remained. These conversions have often resulted in large financial rewards for top bank executives. Current mutual saving banks include Eastern Bank, Dollar Bank, Ridgewood Savings Bank, Middlesex Savings Bank, and Liberty Bank.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, several building societies in Australia converted to banks but were required to demutualise when doing so. These included Advance Bank (formerly NSW Building Society), St. George, Suncorp, Metway Bank, Challenge Bank, Bank of Melbourne and Bendigo Bank. A change in regulation meant that building societies and credit unions were no longer required to demutualise upon converting to banks, and several including Heritage Bank have converted since 2011 while retaining their status and structure as mutual organisations.\n\nMutual savings banks were designed to stimulate savings by individuals; the exclusive function of these banks is to protect deposits, make limited, secure investments, and provide depositors with interest. Unlike commercial banks, savings banks have no stockholders; the entirety of profits beyond the upkeep of the bank belongs to the depositors of the mutual savings bank. Mutual savings banks prioritize security, and as a result, have historically been characteristically conservative in their investments. This conservatism is what allowed mutual savings banks to remain stable throughout the turbulent period of the Great Depression, despite the failing of commercial banks and savings and loan associations.\n\n\n"}

Along with the marquessate and its subsidiary titles he succeeded as Hereditary Chamberlain of Dunfermline.\n\nHe rarely spoke in the House of Lords and only achieved fleeting prominence during the Bosnian War debate (28 October 1996) and a subsequent letter to \"The Times\" on this subject.\n\nLord Tweeddale died on 1 February 2005, aged 57, and was succeeded by his younger twin brother David Hay.\n\nThe Hays of Yester were possibly related to the Hay earls of Erroll, who held prominent ceremonial office under the Scottish Crown. The 13th Marquess is a descendant of King Charles II of England and Scotland, via his maternal grandmother Lady Joan Capel, later Viscountess Ingleby.\n\nThe 13th Marquess was the eldest of five sons of David Hay, 12th Marquess of Tweeddale (1921–1979), and his first son (and elder twin son) by his first wife Hon. Sonia Peake, daughter of Osbert Peake, 1st Viscount Ingleby.\n\nThe Marquess died unmarried, and was succeeded by his twin brother, Lord David, thus becoming one of the few British aristocrats to be succeeded by a younger twin. The next heir is their youngest brother Lord Alastair Hay, styled Master of Tweeddale as heir presumptive.\n\nSince none of the three brothers (sons of the 12th Marquess's first marriage) are married, the next in succession are their two half-brothers, sons of the 12th Marquess's second marriage. The two half-brothers are also twins, but the older of the two, Lord Andrew Arthur George Hay, is the only one with issue.\n\nThe 13th Marquess is remembered chiefly for being one of the few British peers to be succeeded by a younger twin brother. Similarly, the 3rd Earl of Durham (1855–1928) was succeeded in 1928 by his younger twin brother, the 4th Earl (1855–1929). The 3rd Viscount Knutsford (1855–1935) also succeeded an older twin, the 2nd Viscount (1855–1931 dspm) on 27 July 1931.\n\nAlthough the 3rd Marquess of Linlithgow and the 1st Baron Glendevon (formerly Lord John Hope) were twins, both were succeeded by their sons.\n\nLord Tweeddale's death:\n"}

He went to Appleton School, South Benfleet, before attending King Edmund School in Rochford. He enlisted in the British Army as a Grenadier Guardsman after leaving school, and served several tours in Northern Ireland, Kenya and Germany. During his time in the Grenadiers, an officer, Captain Robert Nairac, GC, was abducted and murdered by the IRA.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Penning subsequently worked as a firefighter for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, before joining his family business prior to embarking upon his career in public service through political journalism. He is known to be an avid supporter of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Penning worked as a media adviser to the Euro-rebels who had had the Conservative Party whip removed by Prime Minister John Major during the Maastricht rebellion. He was subsequently the election agent to Sir Teddy Taylor during the 1997 general election. He stood for election in Thurrock at the 2001 general election, coming second to Labour's Andrew MacKinlay. Following this, he was appointed as a chief adviser to William Hague as Leader of the Opposition, later becoming the Conservative Party's Deputy Head of Media under the brief and unpopular leadership of Iain Duncan Smith.\n\nAt the 2005 general election Penning stood in the Labour-held seat of Hemel Hempstead, narrowly defeating sitting MP Tony McWalter. Penning overturned McWalter's 2001 majority of 3,742 votes and won the seat (after a partial recount) by 499 votes. In July 2007, Penning was promoted by Conservative Leader David Cameron to the post of Shadow Minister for Public Health.\n\nThe Buncefield fire occurred on 11 December 2005 and led to some 2,700 claims for compensation. In the words of neighbouring MP Peter Lilley, \"There is something providential about the fact that the worst fire in western Europe since the Second World War should occur in a constituency represented by a fireman. It was undoubtedly in the interests of all his constituents and mine to have someone so knowledgeable, as well as so vigorous in their response, to represent their interests.\" Penning, who arrived on the scene within half an hour of the explosion, had himself been trained to deal with much smaller petroleum fires; the scenario was that one tank not twenty was affected.\n\nDexion workers, 700 of whom worked in the constituency, lost their pensions when the company went into receivership in 2003. Dexion played a prominent part in Dr Ros Altmann's Pensions theft campaign. Penning, whose support for Dexion preceded his election, offered compensation from unclaimed assets in his 2005 Manifesto and has spoken on the issue 26 times in Parliament. Dexion pensioners were featured celebrating a victory at the High Court in February 2007 which eventually led to increased compensation from the then-Labour government.\n\nAccording to Theyworkforyou.com, Penning spoke in an \"above average\" number of debates from 2009–10 and replied to a \"very high number\" of messages. He also received replies to an \"above average\" number of written questions. The quality of those questions was disputed by a 2006 \"Times\" article about the Theyworkforyou website which Penning used to email constituents. His 624 questions in 10 months included one on sales of lost property in Royal Parks since records began. The newspaper suggested the objective was to increase ratings on the website, an allegation rejected by Penning.\n\nPenning \"occasionally rebelled\", with two percent of his votes being against the Whip, and was \"very strongly\" in favour of a smoking ban. Penning's parliamentary expenses details have been published as part of a general publication of all MPs' expenses. In 2009, he claimed a total of £135,078, 502nd of all MPs. The Legg Report found no problem with his expenses. Penning did, however, voluntarily repay £2.99 for a dog bowl, which was the lowest recorded repayment by any MP.\n\nIn the June 2017 General Election he held Hemel Hempstead with a reduced majority of 9,445, but with an increased share of the vote (55%).\n\nPenning achieved one of the largest increases in his majority of all MPs at the 2010 general election, when he took 50% of the vote share to hold the seat with a majority of 13,406. This result relegated Labour's Ayfer Orhan to third place behind the Liberal Democrat candidate Richard Grayson, representing the largest swing from the Labour Party to the Conservative Party (a 14.4% swing) in the country.\n\nFollowing that election, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him a Minister of State for Transport, with roads and shipping being among his responsibilities. In his capacity as Minister for Shipping, Penning presented Efthimios Mitropoulos (immediate past-IMO Secretary-General) with the insignia of in Greece on behalf of The Queen. In his role as Road Safety Minister, he suggested that the Dutch could learn about cyclist safety from the British. However, cycling ambassador Roelof Wittink said that although the UK had a lower death toll per head of population, the Dutch use cycles far more and have one third of the fatalities per mile cycled.\n\nIn the reshuffle of 4 September 2012, Penning was moved to become Minister of State for Northern Ireland, a position he held for just over a year until being promoted to become Minister of State for Disabled People on 7 October 2013. He was subsequently promoted a second time on 15 July 2014 to serve as both the Minister of State for Policing and the Minister of State for Justice, and was also sworn of the Privy Council.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, Penning increased his majority by 2.9% to 52.9% to hold his seat with a 14,420 majority. In the subsequent reshuffle, Penning was appointed as Minister of State in the Home Office for Policing and Criminal Justice.\n\nFollowing the June 2017 general election, he was relieved of ministerial duties.\n\nPenning supported Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.\n\nPenning lives in Hemel Hempstead with his wife Angela. He employs his wife as his Office Manager on an annual salary up to £40,000. He has two daughters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867376", "title": "Renaldo Nehemiah", "text": "Renaldo Nehemiah\n\nRenaldo Nehemiah (born March 24, 1959) is a retired American track and field athlete who specialized in the 110 m hurdles. He was ranked number one in the world for four straight years, and is a former world record holder. Nehemiah is the first man to run the event in under 13 seconds. Nehemiah also played pro football in the National Football League (NFL) as a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers from 1982 to 1985, before returning to track and field athletics from 1986 to 1991. After retiring from competition, he has worked in sports management.\n\nNehemiah was nicknamed \"Skeets\" as a baby because he crawled so fast. The nickname followed him. He was the national junior champion in 1977, the same year he graduated from Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in his hometown of Scotch Plains, New Jersey. Nehemiah's high school personal bests were 12.9 in the 110 meter hurdles and 35.8 in the 300 meter hurdles, so much faster than his competitors that his coach had him compete over 42 inch hurdles (collegiate height) and occasionally train over 45 inch hurdles. He was \"Track and Field News\" \"High School Athlete of the Year\" in 1977. The cover was noted for showing Nehemiah in a reflective mood rather than in action as most other \"T&FN\" covers. \"I always look spaced out at meets, sort of nonchalant,\" Nehemiah told \"The New York Times\" in response. After graduating from Scotch Plains-Fanwood, Nehemiah attended the University of Maryland, where he won three NCAA titles including the 1978-9 NCAA Indoor Championships.\n\nNehemiah's sophomore year at UMD proved to be his breakout year. He broke the world record in the 110 meter hurdles twice in two weeks, running 13.16 and then 13.00. He won the 1979 IAAF World Cup and Pan-American Games titles, as well as the second of four U.S. national titles. At the 1979 Penn Relays, Nehemiah anchored UMD's shuttle hurdle relay, 4 × 400 meter relay, and 4 × 200 meter relay, and was named meet MVP. During the relays he recorded an unofficial split of 19.4 seconds in the 4-by-200 meter relay and a 44.3 second split in the 4 × 400 meter relay. Nehemiah described his 400-meter leg as follows:\n\nThe prohibitive favorite to win the 110-meter hurdles in the 1980 Summer Olympics, he was unable to compete due to a 64-nation boycott of the Games. Nehemiah received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. At the 1981 Weltklasse meeting in Zürich, Switzerland, Nehemiah broke the world record for the 110 meter hurdles and became the first person to ever run the race in less than 13 seconds. In an interview, Nehemiah explained his race as less than ideal:\n\nPat Connolly, who also coached sprinter Evelyn Ashford, was instrumental in reviving Nehemiah's track career after his short foray in football. Connolly is quoted as saying:\n\nShe also believed he may have been better suited for the 400 m hurdle event. She is on record as saying:\n\nDespite never playing football in college, Nehemiah worked out in 1982 for several NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Washington Redskins, Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Giants and New England Patriots; he signed with the 49ers. During his three years as a wide receiver he caught 43 passes for 754 yards, a 17.5 average, and four touchdowns. Although he was part of the Super Bowl winning team in the 1984 season, he did not play a major role. His football career is deemed by some to be a failure – many think it represents one of the most glaring mistakes ever made by 49ers head coach Bill Walsh – winning Nehemiah a comparison to the track star Jimmie \"Oops\" Hines, who won his infamous nickname for his inability to catch the ball. However, Nehemiah's presence on the field would often force opposing defenses into deep coverage. Nehemiah was deemed expendable in 1985 when the 49ers drafted Jerry Rice in the first round, and he returned to the track in 1986.\n\nNehemiah was the only four-time winner of \"The Superstars\", a made-for-television decathlon-style competition broadcast by ABC Sports (and during the late 1980s, NBC Sports). He won the event in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986.\n\nHe is currently involved with Athletics Managers, a sports management and marketing agency. Clients he has represented have included Allen Johnson, Mark Crear and Justin Gatlin and 2012 400 meter Olympic Gold Medalist Kirani James.\n\n"}

She has, since 2006, been the president of the China Writers Association and is a member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Her works include short stories, \"Ah, Xiangxue\" (), \"The Red Shirt Without Buttons\" (), \"June's Big Topic\" (), \"Wheat Straw Stack\" (), \"Cotton Stack\" (), \"The Village Road Takes Me Home\", \"Rose Door\" (), \"How Long is Forever\" () and \"Da Yu Nü\" () (Big-Bath Woman).\n\nTie Ning traces her ancestry to Hebei province. In 1975, after graduation from high school in Baoding, Tie Ning went to Hebei Province to experience rural life. In 1979, she returned to Baoding and worked in the Baoding Branch of the Chinese Federation of Art and Literature as novel editor. In 1984, she worked in the Creative Writing Workshop of Hebei. Now she is the chairperson of the Writers Association of China, a position no woman had ever held before. On 4 December 2016 Tie Ning was subsequently elected as chairwoman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, replacing Sun Jiazheng, in addition to being reelected as chairperson of the Writers Association of China.\n\nTie Ning started publishing her works in 1975. In 1982, her short story \"Ah, Xiangxue\" () won a national award. In 1984, her medium-length novel \"The Red Shirt Without Buttons\" () and her short story \"June's Big Topic\" () won national awards. Since 1980, Tie Ning has published \"Path in the Night\" and other collections of short stories and novellas. Her \"Wheat Straw Stack\" () won an award as the 1986/1987 \"Middle-length Novel Offprint\" (). She won the Lao She Literary Award in 2000 and 2002.\n\nHer early works mainly depicted ordinary people and daily life, exquisitely portraying her characters' inner worlds, and reflecting people's dreams and pursuits and the absurdity and suffering in their lives.\n\nIn 1986 and 1988, she published two novels, \"Wheat Straw Stack\" () and \"Cotton Stack\" () respectively, both reflecting ancient history and culture and dealing with women's experiences. After 1986, her novels changed direction to reflection on traditional Chinese cultures, with polysemous themes and varied techniques. In 1988, she wrote her first full-length novel, \"Rose Door\" (), in which she departed from her harmonious and idealistic poetic style, and displayed the dark side of life through the competition for survival among women of several generations.\n\n\nThis is a story about a pure and pretty country girl, Xiangxue, \"fragrant snow\" in Chinese. Xiangxue lives in a village in the mountains. Every day, a train from outside the mountains stops at the village just for a minute. Xiangxue and other country girls each take a small basket of eggs to the train when it stops and exchange them for things they want, because they cannot get what they need in the village. Xiangxue carries the basket onto the train, and when she sees a pencil box beside a city girl of her age, she immediately wants it. She offers her for it a full basket of eggs; the exchange is made. It opens up a door to the outside world for her. The story shows the country girl's simplicity and her yearning for civilization.\n\n\nTie Ning is critical of the masculine model as a basis for thought about opposition to the power of the party or state and for assuming responsibility over women's lives. This model is embodied in two male characters who both want to marry the female protagonist because they feel responsible for her earlier marriage to a peasant, which left her a widow and prevented her from returning to the city after the policy of sending educated youths to rural China ended.\n\nIn her story about the female protagonist's choice between the two, which entails the significant and ideologically loaded choice between the city and the countryside, Tie Ning reveals the complicity of the masculine model in the party's and state's dominant ideology, despite its apparent opposition to it. In its place, she offers the protagonist's feminine view, that one should determine one's life-course based on one's own needs, desires, and abilities, rather than with reference to either opposition to or compliance with the party-state and its ideology.\n\n\nBai Daxing is a typical girl brought up in Beijing's Hutongs. She is a kind girl who is always willing to offer help to everybody around her without any consideration of her own interests. But the innocent Bai is cheated repeatedly by the friends who have received her help and love. The people she trusts most make use of her purity and warm-heartedness, leaving Bai with less and less. Bai's personality does not seem to be suited to the times. Tie uses Bai to emphasize how far modern society is from perfection.\n\n\nTie Ning's semi-autobiographical novel illustrates how difficult it is for Chinese writers to ignore the national allegory. Set in the world of writing and publishing, the novel relates the story of a young woman and of two older men who are both in love with her. The narrative alternates between first- and third-person as the protagonist connects her love affair with her memories of her teenage years, showing how she achieves strength through the interweaving of her private and public lives.\n\n\n"}

A force of about 1,500 men under Sir John Moore moved out of New Ross towards Wexford as part of an overall encirclement operation in conjunction with General Gerard Lake's forces moving from the north.\n\nMoore's force was to link up and combine with the isolated garrison holding Duncannon before moving deeper into County Wexford, but after waiting several hours with no sign of their arrival, Moore decided to press ahead to the village of Taghmon alone. Upon nearing Goffs Bridge at Foulkesmill, his scouts reported a rapidly moving rebel force of some 5,000 moving quickly along the road with the intent to give battle. Moore despatched a force of riflemen from the 60th Regiment to hold the bridge until artillery could be brought up in support.\n\nThe rebels however, led by Father Philip Roche, spotted this move and moved away from the road to the high ground on the left intending to outflank Moore's force. The 60th were forced to engage the rebels on the roads, fields and forests of the area and the rebel flanking move briefly threatened to overturn Moore's left. Moore had to personally rally his fleeing troops to hold the line and led them in a successful counter-attack. As more troops began to arrive the rebels were flushed out of their concealed positions, allowing the artillery to be brought into play and the rebels' move was foiled. The rebels were gradually pushed back field by field but were able to withdraw the bulk of their force safely.\n\nThe road to Wexford was opened and the town recaptured by the Crown the next day, but during this battle, followers of rebel captain Thomas Dixon massacred between 35-100 (estimates vary) loyalist prisoners at Wexford bridge. \n\nCasualties are estimated at 500 on the rebel side and 100 of the military.\n\n\"\"The Peoples Rising -Wexford in 1798\"\" (1995) - Daniel Gahan <br>\n\"\"Ireland 1798: The Battles\"\" - Art Kavanagh, \n"}
{"id": "1867412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867412", "title": "Chelsea porcelain factory", "text": "Chelsea porcelain factory\n\nChelsea porcelain is the porcelain made by the Chelsea porcelain manufactory, the first important porcelain manufactory in England, established around 1743–45, and operating independently until 1770, when it was merged with Derby porcelain. It made soft-paste porcelain throughout its history, though there were several changes in the \"body\" material and glaze used. Its wares were aimed at a luxury market, and its site in Chelsea, London, was close to the fashionable Ranelagh Gardens pleasure ground, opened in 1742.\n\nThe first known wares are the \"goat and bee\" cream jugs with seated goats at the base, some examples of which are incised with \"Chelsea\", \"1745\" and a triangle. The entrepreneurial director, at least from 1750, was Nicholas Sprimont, a Huguenot silversmith in Soho, but few private documents survive to aid a picture of the factory's history. Early tablewares, being produced in profusion by 1750, depend on Meissen porcelain models and on silverware prototypes, such as salt cellars in the form of realistic shells.\n\nChelsea was known for its figures, initially mostly single standing figures of the \"Cries of London\" and other subjects. Many of these were very small by European standards, from about 2 to 3 inches (6 to 9 cm) high, overlapping with the category of \"Chelsea Toys\", for which the factory was famous in the 1750s and 1760s. These were very small pieces which often had metal mounts and were functional as bonbonnières (little boxes), scent bottles, needlecases, étuis, thimbles and small seals, many with inscriptions in French, \"almost invariably amorous suggestions\", but often misspelled.\n\nFrom about 1760, its inspiration was drawn more from Sèvres porcelain than Meissen, making grand garnitures of vases and elaborate large groups with seated couples in front of a bocage screen of flowering plants, all on a raised base of Rococo scrollwork. As with other English factories, much of the sales came from public auctions, held about once a year; copies of the catalogues for 1755, 1756 and (in part) 1761 are very useful to scholars. \nIn 1770, the manufactory was purchased by William Duesbury, owner of the Derby porcelain factory, and the wares are indistinguishable during the \"Chelsea-Derby period\" that lasted until 1784, when the Chelsea factory was demolished and its moulds, patterns and many of its workmen and artists transferred to Derby.\n\nThe factory history, before the merger with Derby, can be divided into four main periods, named for the identifying marks under the wares, although the changes in marks do not exactly coincide with changes in materials or style. Some pieces are unmarked in all periods, and there appears to be some overlapping of marks; indeed some pieces have two different marks. There are also anchor marks in blue and brown, and an extremely rare \"crown and trident\" mark in underglaze blue, known on only about 20 pieces, and thought to date from around 1749. A chipped beaker with this mark fetched £37,000 at auction in 2015.\n\nThese early products bore an incised triangle mark. Most of the wares were white and were strongly influenced by silverware designs. The early body was \"a very translucent material, resembling milk-white glass\", later changing \"to a harder and rather colder-looking material\". Slipcasting rather than pressing paste into the moulds was introduced during this period, and remained usual for Chelsea figures.\n\nThe most notable products of this era were white saltcellars in the shape of crayfish. Perhaps the most famous pieces are the \"Goat and Bee\" jugs that were also based on a silver model. Copies of these were made by Coalport porcelain in the 19th century. Sales were suspended in March 1749, which appears to be when Sprimont took control, and the factory was moved a short distance within Chelsea.\n\nOn 9 January 1750 Sprimont advertised the reopening of the factory, with \"a great Variety of Pieces for Ornament in a Taste entirely new\", and the new mark is assumed to celebrate this. The factory was very close to the Thames, and the anchor is a symbol of hope, and of Saint Nicolas of Myra, patron saint of seamen, after whom Sprimont was perhaps named.\n\nThe next six or so years were the most successful for the factory. In this period, the paste and glaze were modified to produce a clear, white, slightly opaque surface on which to paint. The influence of Meissen is evident in the classical figures among Italianate ruins and harbour scenes and adaptations from Francis Barlow's edition of \"Aesop's Fables\". In 1751, copies were made of two Meissen services. Chelsea also made figures, birds and animals inspired by Meissen originals. Flowers and landscapes were copied from Vincennes porcelain (soon to move to Sèvres). A set of figures of pairs of birds were evidently based on the illustrations to \"A Natural History of Uncommon Birds\", by George Edwards, published in four volumes from 1743 to 1751. The copies used were probably with uncoloured illustrations, as though the forms follow the illustrations well, the colouring of the figures is often eccentric and inaccurate.\n\nAs at Meissen and Chantilly some time earlier, imitations of Japanese export porcelain in the Kakiemon style were popular from the late 1740s until around 1758. These were copied both from the Continental imitations and Japanese originals, and some apparently freshly created in the style.\n\nSome tableware was decorated with bold and botanically accurate paintings of plants, known as \"botanical\" pieces, which essentially take onto porcelain the style of the large botanical book illustrations that were beginning to be produced, and often hand-coloured. The factory was very close to the Chelsea Physic Garden (founded 1673 and still open on the same site), which may have influenced the approach, and at least provided illustrated books as models. Some pieces were copied from various books, including those by Philip Miller, the director of the gardens (the eighth edition of \"The Gardener's Dictionary\" (1752) and \"Figures of Plants\", vol 1, 1755) and Georg Dionysius Ehret. An advertisement in 1758 offered \"Table Plates, Soup Plates, and Desart Plates enamelled from the Hans Sloane's Plants\" (Sloane had set up the garden's current site in 1722).\n\nThese innovative pieces exerted a long-lasting influence on porcelain design, especially in Britain, and similar styles have seen a strong revival from the late 20th century, led by Portmeirion Pottery's \"Botanic Garden\" range, launched in 1972, using designs adapted from Thomas Green's \"Universal or-Botanical, Medical and Agricultural Dictionary\" (1817).\n\nThe small \"Toys\", which become prominent in this period, may have been copied from the elusive \"Girl-in-a Swing\" factory, now usually located at St James's, an even more fashionable location in the West End of London, which was active about 1751–54. This seems to have been connected to the Chelsea factory in some way. Another development was tureens and sometimes other large forms in the shapes of animals, birds or plants.\n\nExamples of fairly exact copying of Meissen wares are the \"Monkey Band\" (\"Affenkapelle\" or \"ape orchestra\" in German), a group of ten figures of monkey musicians, and a larger excited conductor, all in fancy contemporary costumes. Such singeries were popular in various media.\n\nThe influence of Sèvres was very strong and French taste was in the ascendancy. Although many existing types continued to be produced, the gold anchor period saw rich coloured grounds, lavish gilding and the nervous energy of the Rococo style. As had been the case with imitations of Meissen Kakiemon, Chelsea began to imitate the Sèvres Rococo style just as Sèvres itself was abandoning it for more restrained shapes and decoration. Chelsea garnitures of vases became very large and elaborate, some with as many as seven pieces in diminishing sizes. The body now included bone ash, and a wider range of colours was used, as well as lavish gilding. The glaze now had a tendency to drip and pool, as well as crazing, and had a slight greenish tint.\n\nIn 1763, George III and Queen Charlotte sent the queen's brother Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz a large Chelsea service. This commissioning of porcelain for diplomatic gifts was common among the ruler-owned European factories (and indeed in East Asia), but novel for England. The service was praised by Horace Walpole, who said it cost £1,200, and is now mostly in the Royal Collection, who have 137 pieces.\n\nEast Asian styles had returned in the red anchor period in the form of versions of Japanese Imari ware, but are more common with the gold anchor. These were to remain an English favourite, especially associated with later Crown Derby, and versions are still made today. According to at least one English authority the first Chelsea versions \"greatly surpass in beauty their dull originals\".\n\nEvidence suggests that production was low from 1763, perhaps because Sprimont wished to retire. A sale in 1763 included at least some moulds and premises, as well as household furniture of Sprimont. No dedicated sale was then held until 1769, when moulds were offered again.\n\nIn August 1769, the factory was sold by Sprimont, whose health had been bad, and the next year it was purchased by William Duesbury of Derby porcelain who ran it until 1784; Sprimont sold the factory in August 1769 to a James Cox. Duesbury and his partner John Heath bought it in February 1770. The factory continued to operate in Chelsea but during this time the Chelsea wares are indistinguishable from Duesbury's Derby wares and the period is usually termed \"Chelsea-Derby\". A final Chelsea sale (at Christie's) began on 14 February 1770.\n\nThe silversmith Nicholas Sprimont (1716–1771), who came from Liège in modern Belgium, was the usual public face of the factory, but there were other main figures, and the precise roles of all of them are uncertain. Charles Gouyn or Gouyon (before 1737–1782) was another London Huguenot silversmith, and also a dealer in porcelain, who was involved in the early years, but whose role is obscure. He has been suggested as being \"concerned with the technical part of the manufacture\", or as providing the finance, and acting as a major buyer or distributor of wares. By 1749 or 1750 there may have been a rift between the two. Gouyn may have founded the \"Girl-in-a-Swing\" factory or St James's factory, named after the fashionable street where he had a shop.\n\nAny porcelain factory needed an \"arcanist\", or chemist who could devise the formulae for the body paste, glaze, and colours, and specify the firing variables. It is not clear who this was at Chelsea; a paper in the British Museum believed to be by Sprimont speaks of having \"a casual acquaintance with a chymist who had some knowledge that way\", who influenced him to start the factory. Gouyn is one suggestion; another is a Thomas Bryand or Briand, who in 1743 showed the Royal Society examples of porcelain. By 1746 he was living in Staffordshire, establishing a business partnership, self-described as a painter who \"had found out ye art of making an Earthenware Little inferior to Porcelain or China Ware\"; but he seems to have died the following year.\n\nLarge payments to the factory are recorded in 1746 to 1748 from Sir Everard Fawkener, secretary to the king's third son, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, who had put down the Jacobite rising of 1745. It is not clear if these were on behalf of the prince or from Fawkener's own funds, or the exact nature of what seems to have been a financing operation. Whereas royal investment in porcelain manufacturing was very common in Europe, it would have been unprecedented in England. A five inch high portrait head of the prince was produced, which was an unusual departure from Chelsea's normal wares. In 1751 a letter says that Fawkener borrowed some Meissen pieces to be copied in Chelsea, and was described as \"concerned in the manufacture of China at Chelsea\", while the same writer adds \"I find that the Duke is a great encourager of the Chelsea China\". A worker at the factory believed that Fawkener and Cumberland were the first owners, who employed Sprimont at a guinea a day. Fawkener died in 1758, in some financial difficulties, and at this point Sprimont may have finally become the full owner.\nSprimont is generally regarded as the guiding hand of the tableware shapes, which made heavy use of metal precedents. Few of the many artists involved are known. The main modeller of figures was the Flemish sculptor Joseph Willems, at Chelsea from about 1749 to 1766, when he left for the factory at Tournai. The miniature painter Jefferyes Hamett O'Neale has been identified as the \"Chelsea Fable Painter\", though not without objections; he later signed pieces of Worcester porcelain, though probably working in London. W.B. Honey felt the signed Worcester pieces were too crude to be by the hand of the \"Chelsea Fable Painter\", though more recent writers accept the identification.\n\nThe leading sculptor Louis-François Roubiliac, French but working in London, was long believed to have modelled many figures, which were additionally marked with an impressed \"R\", but it seems that this mark means something else, and it is likely that there were at most only a handful of instances of models by him. Sprimont was the godfather of one of his daughters. One Chelsea figure certainly based on his work is the reclining portrait of the painter William Hogarth's pug dog called Trump. Roubiliac sculpted Trump in terracotta in about 1741, to accompany a bust of Hogarth. The figure appeared in Chelsea porcelain some years later, and then in Josiah Wedgwood's Black Basalt ware after he bought a cast of the terracotta in 1774. A portrait bust of Frederick, Prince of Wales also appears close to Roubiliac's style.\n\nWilliam Duesbury, who bought the factory in 1770, had been a painter of Chelsea and other wares at his own London workshop, which is documented by an account book of his covering 1751 to 1753 which has survived. However, no Chelsea pieces by his workshop can be securely identified. The books record many figures of birds in particular.\n\nMuch of the distribution of Chelsea and other English porcelain (and fine earthenware such as Wedgwood) was through the \"chinamen\", already a recognised category of dealers and retailers for porcelain, and \"warehouses\" in Central London, which sold mainly to smaller dealers and shop-keepers, often from the provinces, but also to customers. Chelsea's arrangements are less well documented than those of Bow, but Gouyn's shop in St James was probably an outlet, at least in the early period. \nThe annual actions were partly intended for the chinamen, with some lots made up of a range of wares to provide a stock. The East India Company had been selling its cargos of East Asian porcelain at auction for some decades. Chelsea wares reached British America, but there were probably few exports to the Continent.\n\nEarly English porcelain was soon being collected, especially in the late 19th century, when prices rose steadily. Over the 20th century there has been a great reversal in collectors' interests, with wares from later in the century far cheaper now (allowing for inflation) than they were a century ago, while the rare earliest pieces have seen dizzying increases in value. The sale at auction in 2003 of a tureen in the form of a hen and chickens for £223,650 was then the auction record for English 18th-century porcelain. In 2018 a pair of plaice-shaped tureens of c. 1755 from the collection of David Rockefeller and his wife fetched $300,000 (both sales at Christie's).\n\nAlthough the first three examples shown here are from the underside of the bases of pieces, where most porcelain factory marks are placed, the very small Chelsea anchor marks are often \"tucked away in the most unexpected places\". In the group of Chinese musicians, the tiny red anchor mark is visible on the raised base at ankle level, between the woman with the tambourine and the boy. \n\n\n"}

His elder half-brother Samuel Martin (1714–1788) was secretary to the Treasury in London. Another brother Sir Henry Martin (1735–1794) was for many years naval commissioner at Portsmouth and Comptroller of the Royal Navy. Sir Henry was father of Thomas Byam Martin.\n\nThis Josiah Martin's uncle, also Josiah Martin (1699–1778) but born in Antigua, left Antigua after 1750 and settled at Far Rockaway, Long Island. He was a member of the first board of trustees for King's College (now Columbia University) in 1754 and a member of the royal council of New York in 1754–1755. From 1759 to 1764, he was on the council of the governor of the Province of New York. Josiah Martin, the younger, married his first cousin Elizabeth Martin, daughter of the elder Josiah Martin of Long Island, in 1761. At first undecided, he became an ensign in the British Army in 1756, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1769.\n\nOn 29 December 1758, Josiah was appointed to the New York Council, a position once held by his uncle. Because of his trips to London and Antigua, the council, in November 1762, temporarily replaced him with Lawrence Read, superseded in turn by Lawrence's father Joseph Read, to sit in Martin's place until he returned. He was given \"a full year to determine whether he will return to the council from the West Indies.\"\n\nOn 1 March 1771, Martin received his appointment from The Crown as Governor of the Province of North Carolina, succeeding James Hasell. Handicapped by illness, he remained in New York and was unable to present himself in the governor's palace at New Bern until Monday, 12 August 1771.\n\n\"Governor Martin tried to give the North Carolinians useful and fair government, but he was hampered by his instructions from Lord Hillsborough, and later by Lord Dartmouth. Tryon left a legacy to Martin of five major problems that plagued North Carolina. These problems were\n\nAfter his home was attacked by Whigs on 24 April 1775, he sent his family to his in-laws' home in New York and took refuge on board the sloop-of-war HMS Cruizer, transferring his headquarters to Fort Johnston on the Cape Fear River. When the Mecklenburg Resolves were published in May 1775, Martin transmitted a copy to England, which he described as \"setting up a system of rule and regulation subversive of his majesty's government.\" Martin then requested a supply of arms and ammunition from General Thomas Gage in Boston. In July 1775, a plot instigated by Martin to arm the slaves was discovered. In retaliation, John Ashe led a group of colonists against Fort Johnston on 20 July. Martin was forced to flee aboard the Cruizer while the colonists destroyed the fort. Martin remained off the coast of North Carolina, directing the rising of the Loyalists, whom he supplied with weapons brought from England.\n\nAfter two attempts during the Carolina campaign to re-establish his administration were turned back, Martin, who was then in ill health due to fatigue, left for Long Island and then England. He died in London in April 1786 and was buried at St George's Hanover Square Church, City of Westminster, London, England.\n\nMartin County, North Carolina, is named after him.\n\n"}

The album had sold 148,561 copies in the U.S. in 2003, before the band was dropped from DreamWorks Records.\n\n\"Transform\" marked, both musically and visually, an obvious change from Powerman 5000's previous science fiction theme. The band composed songs in a simpler, more straightforward manner with less emphasis on industrial metal and nu metal elements and heaviness. The video for its lead single, \"Free,\" also demonstrated the band's visual stylistic detour; rather than space costumes, the majority of band members are dressed in denim while performing in a red room covered in graffiti, creating a colorful, punk rock influenced edge.\n\nThe album artwork contains symbols reminiscent of the Amphisbaena. Adorning the CD artwork are four two-headed arrows wrapped back pointing at each other, the outermost one sprouting two extra arrows for a total of six on the right, and underneath the CD are two worm like creatures face to face forming a circle.\n\nIn support of the album, the band announced they would begin touring through the U.S. in April, along with Stone Sour and Ra.

Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser at that time and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0. New versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were released at a rapid pace over the following few years. Due to the intense competition in the web browser market, the development of these browsers was fast-paced and new features were added without any coordination between vendors. The introduction of new features often took priority over bug fixes, resulting in unstable browsers, fickle web standards compliance, frequent crashes and many security holes.\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), founded in 1994 to promote open standards for the World Wide Web, pulled Netscape and Microsoft together with other companies to develop a standard for browser scripting languages called \"ECMAScript\". The first version of the standard was published in 1997. Subsequent releases of JavaScript and JScript would implement the ECMAScript standard for greater cross-browser compatibility. After the standardization of ECMAScript, W3C began work on the standardization of Document Object Model (DOM), which is a way of representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. DOM Level 0 and DOM Level 1 were introduced in 1996 and 1997. Only limited supports of these were implemented by the browsers, as a result, non-conformant browsers such as Internet Explorer 4.x and Netscape 4.x were still widely used as late as 2000. DOM Standardization became popular since the introduction of DOM Level 2, which was published in 2000. It introduced the \"getElementById\" function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS. DOM Level 3, the current release of the DOM specification, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari and Gecko-based browsers (like Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).\n\nIn the early part of the century, practices such as browser sniffing were deemed unusable for cross-browser scripting. The term \"multi-browser\" was coined to describe applications that relied on browser sniffing or made otherwise invalid assumptions about run-time environments, which at the time were almost invariably Web browsers. The term \"cross-browser\" took on its currently accepted meaning at this time as applications that once worked in Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 and had since become unusable in modern browsers could not reasonably be described as \"cross-browser\". Colloquially, such multi-browser applications, as well as frameworks and libraries are still referred to as cross-browser.\n\nNot to be confused with multi-browser compatible, cross browser compatible applications and websites will be stable in any version of a browser. The ability of a site to be easily viewed across different browsers is essential to usability for Internet users. A web application behaves exactly as desired in one browser but might have other issues in another browsers. So the issues will hamper the vigorous functionality of an application. The clients who look out for a professional application or a website can rely on cross browser testing which would help client applications in producing different results on different web browsers as they run in applets, Flash, JavaScript requests and so on. \n"}

Martin\n\nClarence Daniel Martin (June 29, 1886 – August 11, 1955) was the 11th Governor of the state of Washington — the first born in the territory of the state. A Democrat, he served two terms from 1933 to 1941.\n\nMartin was born and raised in Cheney in the Washington Territory. He graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle in 1906, and joined his father in running the Cheney Grain and Milling Company. From 1928 to 1936 Martin was the mayor of Cheney. While still in office, he ran for and was elected in 1932 as governor of the state of Washington. He was known as the \"people's governor\" for his strict frugality in government spending, but he also oversaw large economic projects, such as the Grand Coulee Dam in the North Cascades, to put people to work during the Great Depression.\n\nHe married Margaret Mulligan of Spokane in 1907, and they had three sons. Martin died in 1955 at the age of 69 and is buried at the Fairmount Memorial Park in Spokane.\n\nMartin Stadium and Academic Center, the football stadium at Washington State University in Pullman, was named in his honor at its opening in 1972.\n\nHe was born in Cheney, Washington to Francies M. and Philena Martin, who migrated to eastern Washington from Ohio by way of Portland in the early 1880s. Martin was educated in the Cheney public schools. He graduated from the State Normal School at Cheney in 1903, and completed additional studies at the University of Washington in Seattle, graduating with a BA degree in 1906.\n\nAfter leaving the university, he joined his wheat-farming father in founding the family business, the F. M. Martin Grain and Milling Company in Cheney. Upon his father's death in 1925, Martin assumed the role of president and general manager of the company. He served in this position until early 1943, when the mill was sold to the National Biscuit Company.\n\nMartin first became interested in politics in his hometown, where he was elected to the city council in 1915. He served as mayor of Cheney from 1928 until he was elected governor. During this period, he was also chairman of the state Democratic committee.\n\nMartin was elected Governor of Washington in November 1932, in the Democratic landslide which virtually replaced most Republicans in state political offices. He was the first native son to be elected to the state's highest office, an honor of which he was extremely proud. Given the dire economic circumstances and the crisis atmosphere of the early 1930s, Martin's first gubernatorial campaign was remarkable in its moderation. There was no demagoguery, no personalities, no threats, no condemnations and no bitter attacks. \n\nHis platform was based on providing unemployment relief and tax reform; he vowed \"to return the state government to the service and benefit of the people.\" By the end of the campaign, he had made 750 speeches and traveled 40,000 miles, but as he said, he \"gave away no cigars, kissed no babies and promised no jobs.\" (Steward, Edgar I. Washington, \"Northwest Frontier,\" Vol. II, New York: Lewis Historical Publications, Co., 1957, pp. 296–97). Both in the primary and general elections, Martin's opponents charged him with trying to buy the gubernatorial office. Martin rebutted these accusations by pointing out that he was using his own money for the campaign and therefore would have obligations to no one. His electoral majority was larger than that gained by incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington. This ensured that he was not accused of winning the office on the presidential coattails.\n\nMartin took office in January 1933. His first term was controversial, and he was criticized for both his political appointments and his relief programs. Martin alienated hard-core Democrats of the state with the appointment of a number of Republicans to high state offices, many of whom were holdovers from the previous administration of Governor Roland Hartley. In justifying his appointment policy, Martin remarked: \"I did not get all of my majority from Democrats and I think both parties should be represented.\" (\"Spokesman Review,\" April 19, 1933 p. 3) Martin recognized the need to set aside partisan politics to effectively combat the Depression.\n\nWhen Martin took office in January 1933, the Great Depression was at its height. In his first inaugural message, Governor Martin acknowledged the severity of the economic crisis. But he recounted the natural and human resources of the state and concluded that \"surely, with such resources at hand, we need only the spirit to seek, the determination to build, the genius to create, and the readiness to cooperate toward a common development.\" He believed it was the primary duty of government to promote the common good; state government must promote constructive, although perhaps unpopular programs, and the people must accept the necessary sacrifices. Martin advocated abandonment of traditional approaches to problem-solving when those approaches proved inadequate. His call for state government action anticipated a similar call on the national level by President Roosevelt.\n\nThose first few months in office were a time of intense activity. Martin proposed increased economy of government through the elimination of waste and the reduction of state employees' salaries; Martin later proposed and the Legislature endorsed a salary reduction of from 10 to 25 percent of all state employees. Martin planned to shift the relief burden from the nearly bankrupt county and local agencies to the state government. He recommended a $10,000,000 bond issue which was to be used to fund employment on minor public works projects. The Legislature approved this bond issue and relief measures were soon forthcoming. He then proposed a complete restructuring of the tax system. In the November 1932 election, the people of the state had affirmed a 40-mill limit on property taxes. This ceiling on the property tax made new sources on tax revenue necessary. Martin proposed a sales tax as a short term, stop-gap measure; he believed that this sales tax would ultimately be replaced by a form of business and occupation tax. The business and occupation tax was enacted during the twenty-third legislative session, but was declared unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court in September, 1933, after a long and bitter struggle. Washington was one forward a contributory system of old-age insurance. Washington was one of the firsts of the northwestern states to enter the field of old-age insurance when the Legislature passed the social security measure in February, 1933. Although the 1933 Legislature failed to provide adequate funding for the pension program, it did establish a needed precedent. In 1935, the Legislature provided additional funds for the program.\n\nGovernor Martin advocated a number of urgent projects in his first inaugural address. He proposed restructuring of the state banking laws to prevent future closures. Education was a particularly important part of the Governor's program. He proposed that the state assume 50 percent of the funding burden of the public school system to insure the continued quality and equality of education. He recommended an \"open door\" policy at the university level for all Washington high school graduates to promote equality of opportunity for higher education. With respect to mortgage debts, Martin believed that some modification of the foreclosure procedure should be enacted to provide a \"breathing spell\" for those farmers and homeowners threatened with the loss of their property. (Martin, Clarence D. First Inaugural Message, 1933. Olympia, Washington: Jay Tomas Printer, 1933)\n\nMartin's first months in office paralleled the feverish activity of the new federal administration. He initiated many programs to fight the depression in the state. An active and constructive fight against the depression characterized his administration, a sharp contrast to the passive acknowledgement shown by the Hartley regime. Martin sought to create jobs rather than provide handouts for the citizens of the state. The Grand Coulee Dam project, initiated early in 1933, was one of the major job-creating projects. In March 1933, the state legislature, at the prodding of the governor, created the Columbia Basin Commission; in June 1933, $377,000 of the ten million dollar bond issue was appropriated for the dam to show the federal government that the state was serious about the project. Roosevelt set aside 63 million dollars for construction of the low dam at Grand Coulee. Governor Martin was on hand for the ground-breaking ceremonies in September, 1933, and he poured the first bucket of cement in December, 1935. Roosevelt approved construction of the high dam with hydroelectric generating capacity in June, 1935, and by the end of Martin's second term Grand Coulee Dam was producing electricity. In the long run Grand Coulee Dam provided electricity for industry and home, as well as irrigation water for the Columbia Basin. Its short-term benefits were equally important for the state. The project provided immediate employment for thousands left jobless in the wake of the Great Depression. Other significant construction projects during Martin's administration eased the burden of unemployment in the state. Both the Lake Washington Floating Bridge and the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows Bridge were completed in 1940 and provided necessary public service as well as jobs for many unemployed. The ambitious project to harness the Columbia River with the Bonneville Dam also provided both electricity and jobs.\n\nThe accomplishments of Martin's administration were not limited to physical construction projects. His keen interest in education insured the continued funding and development of the public school system in the state at a time when local agencies were unable to provide adequate monies and the system's continuation was in grave danger. Martin also maintained his commitment to higher education. Despite financial hard times for the state, Martin supported an extensive building program at Washington State College, a program facilitated by Martin's respect for and friendship with President E. O. Holland. Martin's administration also reorganized the state's highway system providing miles of new and improved roads as well as many new jobs. He also directed the reorganization of the State Highway Patrol. With the end of prohibition the state of Washington secured much needed revenue by organizing and operating the retail liquor business. The liquor control system established by the Martin administration is still with us today. His dealings with the federal government, although strained at times, secured for the state a substantial portion of the New Deal aid necessary for economic reconstruction.\n\nGovernor Martin was re-elected in 1936, soundly defeating former Governor Hartley. His majority in 1936, which was greater than that of his first election and again larger than President Roosevelt's statewide vote, reflected the popular confidence in his administration. His second term continued the sound fiscal practices and businesslike government he had initiated in 1933. He sought an unprecedented third term in 1940, but was defeated in the primary by former Senator C. C. Dill, who, although supported by Martin in the general election, was defeated in an exceedingly close contest by Republican Arthur Langlie.\n\nMartin's political career and aspirations did not end with his tenure as governor. In February, 1944, Governor Martin was appointed to fill a vacancy in the state House of Representatives from the Fifth District and served a special session. In 1948 he again sought election to the state's highest office but was defeated in the primary. He was reelected to the Cheney City Council in 1950.\n\nMartin married Margaret Mulligan on July 18, 1907. They had three sons: William F., Clarence D., Jr. and Frank M. He and his wife were divorced in August 1943. Martin remarried in April 1944, and with his new bride, the former Merle L. Lewis of Spokane, left Cheney and settled in southern California, but were divorced in March 1946. Martin married his third wife, Lou Eckhart, in December 1951, and they lived in Cheney until his death on August 11, 1955.\n\nMartin's public commitment to the welfare of the state's citizens is documented by the deeds of his administration, but his private actions also reveal a man of generosity and compassion. Martin personally aided a number of worthy young men with their college educations, as well as providing scholarship funds for his alma mater, the newly named Eastern Washington College of Education at Cheney. He continued his interest in debate and public speaking, activities at which he excelled in college, by sponsoring an annual oratorical contest in Cheney. He took a personal interest in the case of a child of twelve who killed an Asotin sheriff during a robbery. With Martin's aid, the youngster was rehabilitated and went on to lead a productive life. Martin also used his financial resources to benefit the citizens of his home town. Earlier, while Mayor of Cheney, Martin donated the city's street lighting system in the memory of his father.\n\nMartin Stadium and Academic Center, an outdoor athletic stadium at Washington State University in Pullman, is named for him. His middle son Dan (Clarence D. Martin, Jr., 1916–1976), made a sizable donation to the project in January 1972.\n\nPhilosophically and politically Martin was a conservative Democrat who, while governor, placed the welfare of the people of the state above party politics. His tenure as governor reflected the sound business and financial practices which guided his entire life. He tempered fiscal conservatism with humanitarian concern for those suffering under the height of the depression. When Martin left office there was still unemployment and economic distress, but the state had weathered the worst years of the depression. One historian records that when Martin left office \"the state was solvent, the radical left-wing groups had been kept in check, and there had been no compromise with Socialistic panaceas.\" Upon his death the Spokesman Review editorialized that \"He served the state well throughout eight critical years of its history.\" In the opinion of many, he was the best governor the state had ever had.\n\n\nWashington State University Libraries, Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections, Pullman, WA\n\n"}

{"id": "1867492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867492", "title": "Starchitect", "text": "Starchitect\n\nStarchitect is a portmanteau used to describe architects whose celebrity and critical acclaim have transformed them into idols of the architecture world and may even have given them some degree of fame among the general public. Celebrity status is generally associated with avant-gardist novelty. Developers around the world have proven eager to sign up \"top talent\" (i.e., starchitects) in hopes of convincing reluctant municipalities to approve large developments, of obtaining financing or of increasing the value of their buildings. A key characteristic is that the starchitecture is almost always \"iconic\" and highly visible within the site or context. As the status is dependent on current visibility in the media, fading media status implies that architects lose \"starchitect\" status—hence a list can be drawn up of former \"starchitects\".\n\nBuildings are frequently regarded as profit opportunities, so creating \"scarcity\" or a certain degree of uniqueness gives further value to the investment. The balance between functionality and avant-gardism has influenced many property developers. For instance, architect-developer John Portman found that building skyscraper hotels with vast atriums—which he did in various U.S. cities during the 1980s—was more profitable than maximizing floor area.\n\nHowever, it was the rise of postmodern architecture during the late 1970s and early 1980s that gave rise to the idea that star status in the architectural profession was about an avant-gardism linked to popular culture—which, it was argued by postmodern critics such as Charles Jencks, had been derided by the guardians of a modernist architecture. In response, Jencks argued for \"double coding\"; i.e., that postmodernism could be understood and enjoyed by the general public and yet command \"critical approval\". The star architects from that period often built little or their best-known works were \"paper architecture\"—unbuilt or even unbuildable schemes, yet known through frequent reproduction in architectural magazines, such as the work of Léon Krier, Michael Graves, Aldo Rossi, Robert A. M. Stern, Hans Hollein, and James Stirling. As postmodernism went into decline, its avant-gardist credentials suffered due to its associations with vernacular and traditionalism, and celebrity shifted back towards modernist avant-gardism.\n\nBut a high-tech strand of modernism persisted in parallel with a formally retrogressive post-modernism; one that often championed \"progress\" by celebrating, if not exposing, structure and systems engineering. Such technological virtuosity can be discovered during this time in the work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Richard Rogers, the latter two having designed the controversial Pompidou Centre (1977) in Paris, which opened to international acclaim. What this so‑called high-tech architecture showed was that an industrial aesthetic—an architecture characterized as much by urban grittiness as engineering efficiency—had popular appeal. This was also somewhat evident in so‑called Deconstructionist architecture, such as the employment of chainlink fencing, raw plywood and other industrial materials in designs for residential and commercial architecture. Arguably the most notable practitioner along these lines, at least in the 1970s, is the now internationally renowned architect Frank Gehry, whose house in Santa Monica, California, bears these characteristics.\nWith urban generation from the turn of the twentieth century picking up, economists forecast that globalization and the powers of multinational corporations would shift the balance of power away from nation states towards individual cities, which would then compete with neighboring cities and cities elsewhere for the most lucrative modern industries, and which increasingly in major Western Europe and U.S. cities did not include manufacturing. Thus cities set about \"reinventing themselves\", giving precedence to the value given by culture. Municipalities and non-profit organizations hope the use of a Starchitect will drive traffic and tourist income to their new facilities. With the popular and critical success of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank Gehry, in which a rundown area of a city in economic decline brought in huge financial growth and prestige, the media started to talk about the so-called \"Bilbao Effect\"; a star architect designing a blue-chip, prestige building was thought to make all the difference in producing a landmark for the city. Similar examples are the Imperial War Museum North (2002), Greater Manchester, UK, by Daniel Libeskind, the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland, by Steven Holl, and the Seattle Central Library (2004), Washington state, United States, by OMA.\n\nThe origin of the phrase \"wow factor architecture\" is uncertain, but has been used extensively in business management in both the UK and United States to promote avant-gardist buildings within urban regeneration since the late 1990s. It has even taken on a more scientific aspect, with money made available in the UK to study the significance of the factor. In research carried out in Sussex University, UK, in 2000, interested parties were asked to consider the \"effect on the mind and the senses\" of new developments. In an attempt to produce a \"delight rating\" for a given building, architects, clients and the intended users of the building were encouraged to ask: \"What do passers‑by think of the building?\", \"Does it provide a focal point for the community?\" The Design Quality Indicator has been produced by the UK Construction Industry Council, so that bodies commissioning new buildings will be encouraged to consider whether the planned building has \"the wow factor\" in addition to more traditional concerns of function and cost.\n\nThe \"wow factor\" has also been taken up by Spanish architecture critics such as \"New York Times\" architecture critics Herbert Mushamp and Nicolai Ouroussof, in their arguments that the city needs to be \"radically\" reshaped by new towers. Discussing Spanish starchitect Santiago Calatrava's new skyscraper at 80 South Street near the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, Ouroussof mentions how Calatrava's apartments are conceived as self-contained urban refuges, $30,000,000 prestige objects for the global elites: \"If they differ in spirit from the Vanderbilt mansions of the past, it is only in that they promise to be more conspicuous. They are paradises for aesthetes.\"\n\nThe notion of giving celebrity status to architects is not new, but is contained within the general tendency, from the Renaissance onwards, to give status to artists. Until the modern era, artists in Western civilization were generally working under a patron – usually the Church or the rulers of the state – and their reputation could become commodified, such that their services could be bought by different patrons. One of the first records of celebrity status is artist-architect Giorgio Vasari's monograph \"Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori\" (in English, \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\"), first published in 1550, recording the Italian Renaissance at the time of its flourishment. Vasari, himself under the patronage of Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, even favoured architects from the city where he resided, Florence, attributing to them innovation, while barely mentioning other cities or places further away. The importance of Vasari's book was in the ability to consolidate reputation and status without people actually having to see the works described. The development of media has thus been equally of central importance to architectural celebrity as other walks of life.\n\nWhile status arising from patronage from the Church and State continued with the rise of Enlightenment and capitalism (e.g., the position of architect Christopher Wren in the patronage of the British Crown, the City of London, the Church of England and Oxford University during the 17th century), there was an expansion in artistic and architectural services available, each competing for commissions with the growth of industry and the middle-classes. Architects nevertheless remained essentially servants to their clients: while Romanticism and Modernism in the other arts encouraged individualism, progress in architecture was geared mostly to improvements in building performance (standards of comfort), engineering and the development of new building typologies (e.g., factories, railway stations, and later airports) and public benevolence (the problems of urbanization, public housing, overcrowding, etc.), yet allowing some architects to concern themselves with architecture as an autonomous art (as flourished with Art Nouveau and Art Deco). The heroes of modern architecture, in particular Le Corbusier, were seen as heroic for generating theories about how architecture should be concerned with the development of society.\n\nSuch publicity also made it into the popular press: in the post-war era \"Time\" magazine occasionally featured architects on its front cover – for instance, in addition to Le Corbusier, Eero Saarinen, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In more recent times \"Time\" magazine has also featured Philip Johnson, Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas and Zaha Hadid. Eero Saarinen is a particularly interesting case because he specialized in building Headquarters for prestigious U.S. companies, such as General Motors, CBS, and IBM, and these companies used architecture to promote their corporate images: e.g., during the 1950s General Motors often photographed their new car models in front of their headquarters in Michigan. Corporations have continued to understand the value of bringing in Starchitects to design their key buildings. For instance, the manufacturing company Vitra is well known for the works of notable architects that make up its premises in Weil am Rhein, Germany; including Zaha Hadid, Tadao Ando, SANAA, Herzog & de Meuron, Álvaro Siza, and Frank Gehry; as is the fashion house Prada for commissioning Rem Koolhaas to design their flagship stores in New York and Los Angeles. However, throughout history the greatest prestige has come with the design of public buildings – opera houses, libraries, townhalls, and especially museums, often referred to as the \"new cathedrals\" of our times.\n\nObjectivity in the question of status would seem questionable. However, researchers at Clarkson University have used the method of Google hits to 'measure' the degree of celebrity status: \"to establish a precise mathematical definition of fame, both in the sciences and the world at large\".\n\nAlthough there are few architects well known to the general public, \"starchitects\" are held in the highest esteem by their professional colleagues and the professional media. Such status is marked not only by prestigious commissions but also by various prizes. For example, the Pritzker Prize, awarded since 1979, attempts to increase its own prestige by mentioning how its procedures are modeled on the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn his 1979 book \"Architecture and its Interpretation\", Juan Pablo Bonta put forward a theory about how buildings and architects achieve canonic status. He argued that a building and its architect achieve iconic or canonic status after a period when various critics and historians build up an interpretation that then becomes unquestioned for a significant period. If the text itself receives canonical status, then the status of the architect is further endorsed. For example, in the first edition of Siegfried Giedion's book \"Space Time and Architecture\" (1949) the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto was not mentioned at all. In the second edition he received more attention than any other architect, including Le Corbusier, who until then had been understood as the most important modernist architect.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between canonic status and \"starchitect\": as part of the \"wow-factor\" aspect of the term depends on current media visibility, it is used only to describe currently practicing architects:\n\n\n\nTracking Turkey’s First Starchitect\n"}

It operated from 1972 until 1996, when problems at the plant became too expensive to fix. It was decommissioned and dismantled between 1997 and 2005, though some of the plant's nuclear waste is still stored on site, pending final disposal.\n\nThe Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company formed in 1966 with plans for a pressurized water reactor in Wiscasset, Maine, and a 40-year operating license. \n\nConstruction of the $231 million ($ today) plant ran from 1968 to 1972, whereupon the plant became Maine's sole operating nuclear power plant. From then until 1996, the 900 megawatt reactor produced about 119 terawatt-hours of electricity, most of the state's energy. In Maine Yankee's most productive year, 1989, it produced 6,900 gigawatt-hours of electricity. \nInitial opposition for constructing the plant was led by Citizens for Safe Power, the Audubon Naturalist Council, the Natural Resources Council of Maine, and Maine’s Governor Kenneth M. Curtis, in the form of a petition to the Atomic Energy Commission, asking for the suspension of the plants operating license due to the concern with environmental and safety issues. The group failed to stop construction but succeeded in persuading the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to impose stricter environmental standards and monitoring. After the malfunction of the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania, citizens Raymond and Patricia Shadis of Wiscasset led a 1,000 people in a march to the capital of Maine to propose a statewide anti-nuclear petition. The initiative to eliminate nuclear power in Maine was voted on several times between 1982 and 1987, but never passed. Finally in 1987, after narrowly missing a vote to shut down the power plant, the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), decided to investigate the power plant for safety violations.\n\nA lengthy Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigation started in 1995, following allegations of safety problems at the plant. The NRC staff identified so many problems that Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. decided \"it would be too costly to correct these deficiences to the extent required by the NRC and decided to shut the plant down\".\n\nThe $500 million decommissioning process ran from 1997 to 2005. In 2000, the first structures were gutted out by workers. In 2003, the reactor pressure vessel was shipped to Barnwell, South Carolina via barge. Finally, in 2004, the facility's containment building was brought down by explosives.\n\nAs of 2010, questions remained about the final disposal of the plant's nuclear waste, following the scrapping of the planned national depository.\n\n\n"}

According to editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov, the special KGB Alfa group made several attempts to cut the radio's access to the transmitter, but its employees managed to connect the studio directly to the transmitter through the telephone line and continue broadcasting. From the first day of its existence Echo of Moscow adhered to one rule: «All significant points of view about events should be presented». Journalists have been jokingly calling the station «Ear of Moscow».\n\nMost of Echo of Moscow's content consists of news and talk shows focusing on social and political issues, where the station tries to represent different points of view. Alexey Venediktov has been the station's chief editor since 1998. Radio hosts of the station include Victor Shenderovich, Yulia Latynina, Sergey Parkhomenko, Alexander Nevzorov, Yevgenia Albats, Vladimir Kara-Murza, Vladimir Ryzhkov, Yevgeny Yasin and Sophie Shevardnadze.\nIn addition to broadcasting, Echo of Moscow runs a website that publishes analytical and factual materials in a variety of fields including international and domestic political affairs, social developments and cultural trends. The articles are written by well-known political analysts, academic researchers, columnists and public figures. Among the website's authors are Dmitrii Bykov, Matvey Ganapolsky, Alexey Navalny, Victor Shenderovich, and a number of others, who have sustained national and international acclaim in their areas of expertise. The Echo of Moscow site is an authoritative source of information, and its publications are regularly cited, relied on and reproduced by major Russian internet publications and other media sources.\n\nAs of 2018 Echo of Moscow is majority owned by Gazprom Media which holds 66% of its shares, the remaining 34% are held by journalist staff.\n\nApproximately 900,000 people in Moscow and 1,8 million in other Russian regions listen to Echo of Moscow daily. According to TNS Global (Moscow, summer 2011), the most common listeners are middle class and upper middle class Russians 40 years and older with a higher education, residing in the city of Moscow. They make up one third of the total listeners of the radio station. The radio's programs can also be streamed online and are available in text, audio and video formats at the station's website. The website itself attracts an average of 700.000 visitors daily.\n\nIn October 2017, the station was broken into by an assailant who pepper-sprayed a security guard and soon afterwards stabbed Tatyana Felgengauer, one of Echo's top presenters, in the neck. Her injuries were life-threatening, but she was able to make a full recovery thanks to timely medical intervention. The station described the attacker as an Israeli, quoting \"informed sources\". Forensic medical expertise determined him to be a paranoid schizophrenic, and he was sentenced to compulsory medical treatment by the court.\n\nIn September 2009, numerous chief editor replies point out that Gazprom and/or other stock-holders did not interfere with informational policy and were not allowed to.\n\nOn 1 November 2014, the station received an official Roskomnadzor warning that a program the station had aired about Ukraine contained \"information justifying war crimes\".

(19 August 1846 – 18 April 1906) was a Spanish Jesuit, elected the twenty-fourth Superior General of the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe third of six brothers, Martín was born of humble parentage. After primary education in his own village he entered the seminary of Burgos in 1858, where he spent six years. His intellectual inclination led him to join the Society of Jesus in 1864. He began his philosophy studies in Léon, but revolution in Spain and anti-clericalism forced him to move to France where he completed his courses, first in Vals, and then in Poyanne. There, he also taught humanities and rhetoric before doing his theology (1873–77). He was ordained on 14 September 1876..\n\nSoon after the anti-religious law of Ferry (1880) compelled Jesuits to leave France. Fortunately the restoration of the Spanish monarchy in the 1870s had now made it possible to repatriate Jesuits back to Spain. On his return to Castile, Martín, though a man of letters, was redirected towards the Biblical studies and teaching. He became was made Rector of the Seminary of Salamanca from 1880 to 1884, then director of the journal \"El Mensajero del Corazon de Jesus\", followed by the appointment as Superior of the Centre of Superior studies of Deusto-Bilbao (the future University of Deusto)\n\nAs Rector of the seminary of Salamanca he had shown qualities of leadership and commitment to spiritual and intellectual formation that led the Superior General to appoint him Provincial of Castile in 1886. He handled tactfully the deep divisions between Carlists and Integrists that were plaguing Catholics in Spain—particularly in the Basque area—including the Jesuits.\n\nMartin was called to Rome by Anton Anderledy to first pilot a projected document of studies in the Society. A few hours before his death (1892) Anderledy made him Vicar General of the Society, effectively entrusting him with the calling and organizing the General Congregation that would elect a new Superior General. The political tension between the Church and the new Kingdom of Italy was making it difficult for the Congregation to meet in Italy. Martin obtained from Pope Leo XIII that the Congregation meet in Loyola, (Spain). This is the only General Congregation to have met outside Italy.\n\nThe 24th General congregation opened on 24 September 1892. Martin was elected on the second ballot (42 on 70) and declared Superior General (2 October). The Congregation over, Martín took a round-about route back to Fiesole, Italy in order to visit France, England, Ireland, Belgium and Germany. This was his only visit to countries which would provide many of the problems of his Generalate. Martin's problems in dealing with Northern European Jesuits can be better understood if one remembers that the Jesuit dissidents with whom he was familiar in Spain were of the reactionary and anti-intellectual type. This experience did little to prepare him to understand the more liberal ideas of northern European Jesuits.\n\n\nEven at the beginning of his term Martín's physical health had been poor and it grew steadily worse with the years. In 1905, a tumor forced the amputation of his right arm. Pope Pius X granted him permission to celebrate mass despite his disability, a privilege for which he was most grateful. The cancer, however, soon invaded his lungs and he died in Rome, on 18 April 1906.\n\n\n"}

She then underwent repairs at New York and Norfolk, Virginia and departed the latter port on 6 November for Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nShe arrived at Halifax on 21 November, was decommissioned on 26 November, and simultaneously commissioned in the British Navy as HMS \"Ripley\". \"Shubrick\" was struck from the Navy List on 8 January 1941. HMS \"Ripley\" was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\"/50 caliber guns and three of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog. \"Ripley\" was assigned to Escort Group B-7 of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force for convoy ON 142 during the winter of 1942–43 and served on North Atlantic convoy routes until placed in reserve in January 1944.

Insurgents massacred up to 200 noncombatant men women and children, most of whom were Protestant, who were held prisoner in a barn which was then set alight. A participant in the rebellion, General Thomas Cloney, put the death count at 100.\n\nA farm and out-buildings in the townland of Scullabogue (also spelled \"Scullaboge\"; ) were used as a staging post for rebel forces before the 1798 Battle of New Ross. The main camp for the rebels was located a mile from Scullabogue on top of Carrigbyrne Hill. \nThe rebels had rounded perceived loyalists of both sexes and all ages who were mainly held in a barn to prevent their supplying the military with intelligence of rebel movements. At dawn on 5 June, the bulk of the rebel army attacked the nearby town of New Ross leaving behind a small number of guards in charge of the captives. The battle at New Ross was a heavy defeat for the rebels who lost almost 3,000 men. Survivors who had fled the fighting had reached Scullabogue with news of the terrible losses while the battle still raged violently.\n\nThomas Cloney, a rebel commander with the rank of General, present at the Battle of New Ross, reported:\n\nThe news had incensed certain elements of the rebel force stationed at Scullabogue, who joined with the deserters in agitating for revenge against the prisoners. The prisoners' guards twice prevented the gathering mob from harming them but eventually gave in to the crowd by allowing the executions by musket-shot of over a dozen particularly hated individuals. However, all semblance of control was quickly lost and the barn was soon torched. People trying to escape the barn were shot, stabbed and beaten to death or forced back into the flames.\n\nOnly two men are thought to have escaped the flames of Scullabogue Barn. One was named Richard Grandy, and the other was Loftus Frizzel. At least twelve, and possibly thirteen men alleged to have taken part in the massacre were executed after the rebellion was suppressed; a further two were transported. Although the massacre has been presented in some sources as sectarian in origin, up to 20 of the victims were loyalist Catholics, and three of the seventeen rebel guards linked directly with the massacre by subsequent depositions (John Ellard, John Turner and Robert Mills) were Protestants. Mills gave detailed evidence on the activities of the other guards, and was set free despite having admitted personally attacking prisoners with his pike.\n\nThere is a Scullabogue Memorial stone in the graveyard of Old Ross Church of Ireland church. The theme is one of reconciliation. The Scullabogue Barn itself was controversially knocked down and covered over by the current proprietor in the 1990s. There is, however, no state memorial to the people who were massacred during this incident.\n"}

As the battle progressed, Cynegils' forces advanced up Win Hill, and Edwin's retreated behind a temporary wall they had built near the summit.

{"id": "1867598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867598", "title": "Guruvayurappan", "text": "Guruvayurappan\n\nGuruvayurappan (, (transliterated guruvāyūrappan)) also often written Guruvayoorappan, is a form of Vishnu worshipped mainly in Kerala. He is the presiding deity of Guruvayur temple, who is being worshiped as Shri Krishna in his child form, also known as Guruvayur Unnikkannan (Guruvayur baby Krishna). Even though the deity is that of \"chaturbahu\" (four handed) Vishnu, the concept (\"Sankalpam\") of the people is that the deity is the infant form of Lord Krishna. The deity represents the \"purna rupa\" (full manifestation) revealed by baby Krishna to his parents Vasudeva and Devaki immediately after his advent in Kamsa's jail. So this is the reason why baby Krishna is worshipped on a Vishnu deity. The temple is located in the town of Guruvayur, Thrissur district, Kerala, India, which is named after the deity itself.\n\nThe word \"Guruvayurappan\", meaning Lord of Guruvayur, comes from the words Guru (ഗുരു) referring to Brihaspati, the Guru of the Devas, Vayu (വായു), the God of Wind and \"Appan\" (അപ്പന്‍), meaning 'father' or 'Lord' in Malayalam. Since Guru and Vayu installed Krishna's deity, the name Guruvayurappan was given to the deity.\n\nIt is believed that the idol of Guruvayurappan was worshipped by Vasudeva and Devaki, the parents of Krishna, and represents the full manifestation of Vishnu, and later was worshipped by Krishna, an Avatar of Vishnu Himself. The deity is made of a stone called \"Patala Anjanam\" or black bismuth and is in the standing pose with four arms, carrying the \"Panchajanya\" (\"shanku\" or conch), the \"Sudarshana Chakra\" (\"chakra\" or disc), the \"Koumodaki\" (\"gada\" or mace) and \"padma\" (lotus).\n\nThough the main story about the idol is just starting since the story of Lord Krishna, its antiquity goes long back, since it is believed to have constructed by Lord Vishnu himself. The story is told in detail in the section 'Gurupavanapura Mahatmyam' from Narada Purana. King Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna and the son of Abhimanyu, died of a bite by the poisonous snake Takshaka, due to a curse which fell upon him. King Janamejaya, his son, wanted to avenge his father's death by killing all the snakes, including Takshaka, and for that, he conducted a fierce yajna called 'Sarpastra' (Snake sacrifice). Thousands of innocent snakes died in the yajna fire, but Takshaka could not be killed because he had drank amrit. Due to this act, Janamejaya was affected by the curse of snakes, and got affected by leprosy. He tried numerous ways to cure his disease, but none of them worked. He lost his hope to live. At that time, sage Atreya (the son of sage Atri) came to visit him and told him to worship Lord Mahavishnu in Guruvayur. He then also told the glory of the temple. It is as follows:\n\nLong ago, in the beginning of Padma Kalpa, when Lord Brahma was undergoing his work of creation, Lord Mahavishnu appeared before him. When the Creator told that he and his creations want 'mukthi' without the bondage of 'karma', Lord Vishnu made an idol of himself and presented it to his friend. Lord Brahma worshipped the idol with deep obeisances for a long time, and in Varaha Kalpa, he gifted it to a sage named Sutapas and his wife Prsni, who were meditating upon Lord Vishnu for begetting a child. Sutapas and Prashni continued their prayer after getting the idol, and finally the Lord appeared before them. When they expressed their wish, which was that they want a son just like the Lord, he told that would himself be born as their son in three successive births, and in all the three births, they could worship his idol made by himself.\n\nAs he said, in the first birth in Satya Yuga, the Lord took birth as Prsnigarbha, the son of Sutapas and Prsni. In that birth, he prophesied the importance of brahmacharya and gave darshan to his devotee Dhruva, to whom he made a special universe called 'Dhruvaloka'. When Sutapas and Prsni were reborn as Kashyapa and Aditi, the Lord took birth as their son Vamana in Treta Yuga. Finally, when they were reborn as Vasudeva and Devaki, the Lord took birth as their eighth son Krishna. In all the three births, they had the fortune to worship the holy idol of Lord Vishnu made by the Lord himself.\n\nAfter coming back from his studies, Lord Krishna took the idol worshipped by his parents to Dwarka, his new abode. He built a temple for the idol here, and daily worshipped the idol with deep obeisances, despite being an avatar of Lord Vishnu himself. Finally, Dwapara Yuga came to an end. Now it was time for the Lord to return to his original abode. Before leaving to Vaikuntha, he called his friend and disciple Uddhava and told that Dwarka would be affected by a serious Tsunami a week later, and the lone non-natural survivor of the flood will be the divine idol worshipped by his parents in three births. He also advised him to hand over the idol to Brihaspati, the Guru of Devas who would come at that moment, and leave to Badrikashram for doing penance for the rest of the lifetime.\n\nAs the Lord prophesied, there came a huge Tsunami on the week followed. Dwarka, which was filled by beautiful palaces, gardens and lush greenery, was completely destroyed in the Tsunami. Only the top of a huge mountain survived. Uddhava had already left to Badrikashram for doing penance, and before leaving, he called Brihaspati and informed him about the idol. By the time Brihaspati reached Dwarka, everything was over. But soon, he saw the holy idol of Lord Vishnu floating on the seawater. Brihaspati was overjoyed, but he could not go near the idol due to the nature of the Tsunami and also it was floating towards the other side. Then he called Vayu, the wind god and one among his important disciples. Vayu, with the help of Varuna, the sea god, created huge waves towards the point where Brihaspati was standing. Brihaspati took the idol in his hands, but he could not answer where to install it. Suddenly, sage Parashurama appeared there and told them to install the idol in an apt location in Bhargava Kshetra. the land made by him with his axe.\n\nAccording to the wishes of the Sage, Brihaspati and Vayu took the idol on their hands, and travelled by sky southwards through the sky to find an apt location in Bhargava Kshetra. Suddenly, they saw a large, beautiful lake on the western side of Bhargava Kshetra, very close to the sea. Nearby it, there was lush greenery. Birds chirped allover. Animals were running happily. Breeze spread everywhere. Brihaspati and Vayu realised something divine there. No sooner, they saw Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati dancing on the lake shore. Brihaspati and Vayu landed on the ground and prostrated before the divine parents of the world. Lord Shiva told them that he was waiting for their arrival, and that the apt location for installing the idol of Lord Vishnu was none other the place where they were standing. He also told that it was there the ten princes called Prachetas came for penance upon Lord Vishnu for attaining the status of Prajapati, and he discoursed Rudra Gita to them. Lord Shiva then declared that since the idol is to be installed by Brihaspati, the Guru and Vayu, the place will be called as 'Guruvayur', and devotees will find solace from the troubles of Kali Yuga.\n\nAfter hearing this, Brihaspati called Vishwakarma, the divine architect and told him to construct a temple for the deity. Vishwakarma constructed the temple within minutes, with all the necessary components. Brihaspati and Vayu installed the idol with all necessary rituals. Lord Shiva performed the first pooja to the deity. Demigods headed by Indra showered flowers. Sage Narada sang songs. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, who were present throughout the divine moment, later shifted themselves to Mammiyur, a place on the opposite bank of the lake, where they appeared as a Swayambhu Linga along with their children Ganesha, Kartikeya and Shasta. Since the idol was installed by Brihaspati and Vayu, the place came to be known as Guruvayur, and the deity came to be known as Guruvayurappan, meaning 'The Lord of Guruvayur'. It is considered that Lord Vishnu resides here with his full power as in Vaikuntha, and thus the place is called 'Bhuloka Vaikuntha'. A darshan here is considered to be complete only by worshipping Lord Shiva in Mammiyur. All problems will be solved by this, and even if you die, it is considered great.\n\nAfter hearing this story, Janamejaya proceeded to Guruvayur along with his family, and stayed there for a year. During these days, he worshipped the Lord with deep obeisances and also visited Mammiyur temple to worship Lord Shiva. Finally, on the day before the end of his worship, he had a darshan of Lord Krishna, after which his disease was cured. He returned to his country, and lived happily thereafter.\n\nAn astrologer told a Pandya King that he was destined to die from a cobra bite on a particular day. He was advised to go and pray before Guruvayurappan. The king spent years in meditation and prayer at the feet of the deity. One day, the King realized that the time of his death had passed. He came back to his palace and asked the astrologer why the prediction was wrong. The wise man showed him the mark on his left foot where the cobra had bitten him. Since the king was wholly absorbed in the Lord, Who alone can dispense with fate, he did not feel the sting. In gratitude, the King built the temple at Guruvayur and set apart funds for the daily routine of the temple. Most of the current temple building dates to the 16th and 17th centuries, although rich devotees funded extensions and additions later. The deepastamba (column of lights) was erected in 1836 by a devotee from Thiruvananthapuram. The temple has gopurams in the east and the west. The eastern gopuram has an inscription which refers to the town as \"Gurupavanapura\". The western gopuram was built in 1747.\n\nKing Manaveda and Vilwamangalam:King Manaveda told Vilwamangalam about his ambition to view Krishna The next day the Swamiyar told him that Guruvayurappan has given his consent and Manavedan can see Guruvayurappan playing in the early hours of the morning at the platform of the Elanji tree.He could only see and not touch Him.When as per this agreement, Manavedan saw Guruvayurappan in the form of little child Sri Krishna, he was so excited that he forgot himself and, rushed to embrace little Sree Krishna.Guruvayoorappan immediately disappeared saying, \"Vilwamangalam did not tell me that this will happen \".However, Manavedan got one peacock feather from the head gear of Bhagavan Krishna.\n\nThe peacock feather was incorporated in the headgear for the character of Sri Krishna in the dance drama Krishnanattam based on his own text krishnageeti which is composed of 8 chapters viz, Avatharam, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam. It was performed near the sanctum sanctorum of the Guruvayur Temple. On the ninth day, Avatharam was repeated as the Samoothiri felt that it was not auspicious to end the series with the demise of Lord Krishna. The blessed art form is still maintained by guruvayur devaswom and staged as an offering by devotees.\n\nShopkeeper and boy: Once, a poor little boy could not get even a morsel of food to appease his hunger, and stole a banana from a nearby fruit shop. Being a devotee of Lord Guruvayurappan, he dropped half the banana into the 'hundi' and he ate the other half. The shop-keeper caught hold of the boy and accused him of the theft. The boy admitted his guilt. The shop-keeper did not have the heart to punish this innocent boy, but to teach him a lesson, he ordered him to walk around the temple a certain number of times. The shop-keeper was aghast when he saw Lord Guruvayurappan follow the little boy around the temple. That night the Lord came to the shopkeeper in a dream and explained, \"Since I have also had a share in the stolen banana I am bound to share the punishment, too. So, I followed the boy around the temple.\" \n\nNenmini Unni: Once a Nenmini Namboodiri, the main priest (melsanthi) at the Guruvayur temple, instructed his twelve-year-old son to offer the Nivedyam to the Lord. There was no assistant priest (keezhsanthi) on that day and the Nenmini Namboodiri had to go out on an urgent engagement, as called by a devotee. The son, Unni, offered a Nivedyam of cooked rice to the Lord; in his simplicity, he believed that the deity would eat the food, but the deity did not move. Unni bought some salted mangoes and curd from a neighborhood vendor, thinking that the Lord would prefer this, mixed the curd with rice and offered it again. The deity again remained unmoved. Unni cajoled, requested, coaxed and in the end threatened, but the deity remained unmoved. He wept because he believed he had failed and shouted at the Lord, exclaiming that his father would beat him. The Lord could not bear it any more, and made the Nivedyam disappear. The boy left the temple satisfied. Unni did not know that the Nivedyam offered to the Lord was the Variyar's prerequisite. When Variyar returned to the temple, he saw the empty plate and became very angry with Unni, but Unni insisted that God had, in fact, eaten the offering. Unni's innocent words made Variyar furious, as he believed the boy had eaten the offering himself and was lying. His father was about to beat Unni, but just then an Asareeri (celestial voice) was heard saying, \"What Unni told is right. I am guilty. Unni is innocent. I ate all the food that he had offered me. There's no need to punish him\". Nenmini family is still there in Guruvayur, and has lots of wealth attached to it. It also sponsors the Saptami (7th day) Vilakku during the annual Ekadasi festival in the Malayalam month of Vrischikam.\nPoonthanam and Melpathur:Poonthanam was a contemporary of Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, another famous poet associated with Guruvayur. Melpathur, the author of the Sanskrit work \"Narayaneeyam\", was a famed scholar who out of pride refused Poonthanam's request to read his \"Jnanappana\", a work in Malayalam. Legend has it that Guruvayurappan, impressed by Poonthanam's humility and devotion preferred his works to those of Bhattathiri's and once even rebuked Bhattathiri for ignoring Poonthanam's \"Santhanagopala Paana\" saying he preferred Poonthanam’s genuine bhakti to Bhattathiri’s \"vibhakti\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867606", "title": "Dictionary of Canadian Biography", "text": "Dictionary of Canadian Biography\n\nThe Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCB; ) is a dictionary of biographical entries for individuals who have contributed to the history of Canada. The \"DCB\", which was initiated in 1959, is a collaboration between the University of Toronto and Laval University. Fifteen volumes have so far been published with more than 8,400 biographies of individuals who died or whose last known activity fell between the years 1000 and 1930. The entire print edition is online, along with some additional biographies to the year 2000.\n\nThe project was undertaken following a bequest to the University of Toronto from businessman, James Nicholson for the establishment of a Canadian version of the United Kingdom's \"Dictionary of National Biography\".\n\nIn the spring of 1959, George Williams Brown was appointed general editor and the University of Toronto Press, which had been named publisher, sent out some 10,000 announcements introducing the project. Work started in July of that year. 1 July was designated the formal date of the Dictionary's establishment, not coincidentally the same day Canada's confederation is celebrated.\n\nNew ground was broken when on 9 March 1961, the French edition of the dictionary was established. No similar research or publication project of this size in English and French had ever been undertaken before in Canada. Marcel Trudel was appointed directeur adjoint for Dictionnaire biographique du Canada, Université Laval the publisher.\n\nIt had been decided from the start that for the project to have true resonance for Canadians, the French and English editions of the Dictionary would be identical in content, save for language, and each volume of the Dictionary would be issued simultaneously. The project by its nature required not only much translation, as articles would originate in English and in French, but close coordination as well.\n\nThe first volume of the \"Dictionary of Canadian Biography\" appeared in 1966 with 594 biographies covering the years 1000 to 1700. The publishers had looked at other similar projects, such as the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" (DNB) and the \"Dictionary of American Biography\" (DAB) and concluded a different approach was required. In those dictionaries, volumes were arranged alphabetically and published over a span of years. For that reason, until the last volume was published (63 for the DNB up to 22 January 2001; 20 for the DAB to the end of 1935), no historical period could be completely covered until the last volume appeared. Those who died subsequently were added in future volumes in a period arrangement.\n\nThe DCB, it was decided, would publish in a period arrangement throughout, with volumes arranged chronologically, and with each volume covering a specific range of years with biographies arranged alphabetically. The volume in which a biography was to appear was determined by death date of the individual in question or, if that was unknown, the date of their last known activity. Volumes were to be of approximate equal size, with the span of time covered within each reducing as biographies moved into the 20th century.\n\nA major drawback to the system was the fact that few people likely would be aware of the death dates of many people and therefore would not know in which volume an individual's biography would be found. This was to be addressed by cumulative indexes and epitome volumes.\n\nSome advantages to the period approach were practical ones – biographies more or less linked by time period would also bring together scholars specializing in those periods, thus making research, editing and cross-checking easier, and readers would not have to keep reacquainting themselves with the historical period the individuals lived in. Additionally, future revisions would be limited to the volumes in question and not the entire series.\n\nThe subjects of biographies were broad. While noteworthy Canadians born and resident in Canada and Canadians who made their reputations abroad were to be included, so were persons from other countries who made a contribution to Canadian life. A general rule was to exclude those persons who had not set foot in what is now Canada, even if their influence on Canada was great. As for those born outside of Canada, focus was to be given to their life in Canada.\n\nA guide was issued for the writers of Volume I biographies, and repeated for subsequent volumes:\n\n\"The biography should be a fresh and scholarly treatment of the subject based upon reliable sources (where possible first-hand) precise and accurate in statements of fact, concise, but presented in attractive literary form... the aim is to secure independent and original treatments and not mere compilations of preceding accounts.\"\n\nThe biographies themselves were to range from about 200 words to a maximum of 8,000 to 10,000 words. There would typically be several hundred contributors for each volume.\n\nAn additional feature, taking advantage of the period approach, was the inclusion of several historical essays to further establish the historical context of many of the subjects of the biographies. Future volumes would also include historical essays, but not all.\n\nVolume II, covering the years 1701 to 1740, appeared in 1969. Biographies of 578 individuals appeared within its pages.\n\nDavid Hayne was now general editor, having replaced Brown who died suddenly during the preparation of Volume I; André Vachon directeur adjoint.\n\nBy this time, there had been an important development which would have the effect of dramatically altering the publication sequence. Canada's centennial was celebrated in 1967 and, accordingly, the government of Canada created the Centennial Commission, in part to promote historical awareness. One of the first acts of the Commission was to award a grant to the DCB specifically towards biographical research in the years 1850 to 1900. As a result, in 1967 it was decided to start preparing volumes for the 19th century. Volume X, ranging from 1871 to 1880, was the first volume to be assembled, and it appeared in 1972 with the biographies of 574 people, many of whom were instrumental in the creation of Canada itself.\n\nFrom this time forward, while the original sequence of volumes continued, a parallel sequence of volumes for the 19th century appeared as well.\n\nIn 1974, the fourth volume, Volume III, was published. The biographies of 550 individuals who died between the years 1741 and 1770 were featured. A period of long editorial stability was established as Francess G. Halpenny, who succeeded Hayne in 1969, would hold the position of general editor for 20 years. Jean Hamelin, who became directeur adjoint in 1973, would hold the French editorial reins until his death in 1998.\n\nThe second volume of the 19th century appeared in 1976: Volume IX. Some 524 biographies by 311 contributors ranged from 400 to 12,000 words in length, encompassing the years 1861 to 1870. It was decided then not to include an introductory historical essay as that would be more properly included in a broader summing up of the era in a later volume.\n\nThe sixth volume published, Volume IV, brought to completion the 18th century. Appearing in 1979, 504 biographies spanned the years 1771 to 1800. That same year, Volume I was reprinted with corrections. Volume II was also reprinted, with corrections, and the seventh volume appeared, both in 1982. Volume XI contained the biographies of 586 noteworthy Canadians who died between 1881 and 1890. A new feature was introduced in this volume: indexes by occupation and geography. This new feature was to be incorporated in new volumes and in reprints of previous volumes as well as separate indexes, one of which appeared in 1981 for Volumes I–IV.\n\nVolume V soon followed, published in 1983. It ranged the years 1801 to 1820, with 502 biographies from 269 contributors. Then, three more volumes followed in 1985, 1987 and 1988 bringing a total of 11: Volume VIII (1851 to 1860) with 521 biographies; Volume VI (1821 to 1835) with 479 biographies; Volume VII (1836 to 1850) with 538 biographies.\n\nFinally, in 1990, the twelfth volume appeared, completing the 19th century. The 597 biographies of Volume XII (1891 to 1900) brought a total of 6,520 biographies to the project as its first main phase drew to a close, and long-time general editor Halpenny retired. An index for these first twelve volumes soon appeared allowing readers to quickly access all 6,520 biographies and all the thousands of other individuals mentioned in those biographies.\n\nVolume XII of the DCB said that the first three volumes of the 20th century were in preparation: Volume XIII (1901–1910); Volume XIV (1911–1918); Volume XV (1919–1925). But when Volume XIII appeared in 1994, with Ramsay Cook as new general editor, the intervening years were described as \"hav[ing] been among the most difficult in the history of this Canadian institution.\" Severe financial restraints were described and a more \"modest\" plan was announced, with each volume covering a decade instead of the shorter intervals previously planned for post-1910. An additional volume was said to be in preparation up to the end of 1940.\n\nNevertheless, Volume XIII continued in the tradition of past volumes, with 648 biographies by 438 contributors, covering the previously announced range of years of 1901 to 1910.\n\nVolume XIV was published in 1998, and marked a dramatic superficial change: a colourful dust-jacket featuring images of some 52 prominent Canadians, a stark contrast to the modest tan covers of previous volumes which featured only text. The contents continued in the scholarly style of the past volumes, however, with 622 biographies of individuals for the years 1911 to 1920. The introduction suggested that the financial and staff pressures were \"becoming more acute\" but held out the hope that \"funds from a wider variety of granting agencies\" would permit the project to continue as planned.\n\nVolume XV appeared in 2005, with a solemn tribute to Hamelin who had died in 1998, and an \"au revoir\" to Cook who completed his participation with the DCB upon publication of the volume. Réal Bélanger had since 1998 replaced Hamelin as directeur general adjoint, and John English has replaced Cook as General Editor.\n\nThe 619 biographies contained within would bring a total of 8,419 biographies spanning the years 1000 to 1930 to the project. And, as a sign of the rapidly changing means of communications the DCB was encountering, mention was made of the millennium project to distribute for free CD-ROMs of the contents of the first 14 volumes of the project to educational institutions and of the intellectual properties licensing agreement made with Library and Archives Canada in 2003 to make available on-line those same 14 volumes with some additional biographies afterwards. The on-line edition of the DCB now has incorporated the biographies of Volume XV, and includes about a dozen biographies of prominent Canadians who died between 1931 and 2000, including every prime minister who had died within that time period.\n\nMention was also made of the financial problems which were making work more difficult, but also of the efforts of many Canadian institutions, corporations, agencies and individuals who made the continuation of the project possible.\n\nThe DCB is preparing Volume XVI which will cover the years 1931 to 1940, and is in the research stages for additional volumes which will encompass the years 1941 to 1980. When this phase of production is complete, there will be more than 10,000 biographies.\n\nIn 2007, the DCB published \"Canada’s Prime Ministers: Macdonald to Trudeau – Portraits from the Dictionary of Canadian Biography\". The 15 biographies therein reproduced those biographies which had appeared in the various volumes of the DCB already published, supplemented by the biographies of the prime ministers who have died since 1930.\n\nThe evaluations by professional historians have been overwhelmingly favourable. Halpenny emphasizes its use of \"the insights of historical geography, sociology, anthropology, and literature,\" and notes that it responds to both the concerns of quantitative historians as well as scholars in the fields of minorities, labor, and women.\n\nRegarding the Maritimes, the \"Dictionary\" says little about early Indian leadership, but, says Godfrey, effectively covers French missionaries, and illuminates Acadia's relationship to France and New France. Volumes IX and X deemphasize Acadians and Indians, and focus mostly on politics as contests between elites. The treatment of Maritime economic and intellectual development suggests that the legendary mid-19th-century Golden Age was only a veneer.\n\n"}

Haas Jr. Pavilion is an indoor arena in the western United States, on the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, California. It is the home venue of the Golden Bears men's and women's basketball, women's volleyball, and men's and women's gymnastics teams. The arena is located in the middle of the main sports complex, overlooking Evans Diamond (baseball) and Edwards Stadium (track/soccer).\n\nThe arena was originally opened in 1933 as the Men's Gym; it was renamed Harmon Gym in 1959, after Oakland financier A.K.P. Harmon, who donated the funds to build Cal's first indoor athletic facility in 1879. Lou Campanelli tried to have it renamed \"Harmon Arena\" when he became head coach, but it never really caught on.\n\nThe playing surface, after being known as simply \"Room 100\" since the arena opened, was renamed Pete Newell Court in 1987 in honor of head coach Pete Newell, who led Cal to the national championship in 1959.\n\nProposals for replacing the old gym were bandied about from the 1970s onward, but sentiment was strongly in favor of rebuilding it instead. As a result, the arena was heavily renovated from 1997 to 1999 after a donation of about $11 million from Walter A. Haas, Jr. of Levi Strauss & Co., building a new seating bowl within the existing walls.\n\nThe new facility retains the intimate atmosphere of its predecessor, while having almost two times the seating capacity at 11,858 (originally 12,300 and later 11,877). In particular, there are no soundproofing devices. The arena contains The Bench, a courtside section that holds approximately 900 student fans. The amount of student seating doubled from the old arena, up to 2,600 from 1,300. It also holds the Pacific-10 Women's Basketball attendance record of 10,525 people, set during a game against rival Stanford University on February 23, 2008.\n\nThe renovation, which cost $57.5 million, began after the final home game in March 1997 and was finished for the start of the 1999 season. During the construction, the basketball teams played at both the Kaiser Convention Center and the Oakland Arena in Oakland.\n\nOn December 22, 2018, the 14th ranked California Bears Women's basketball team faced the number 1 ranked University of Connecticut Huskies Women's basketball team. The Connecticut women's basketball team prevailed 76-66 at Haas Pavilion. The game set attendance records at Haas Pavilion with over 10,000 fans in attendance.\n\nThe 2009 men's basketball game between Cal and arch rival Stanford on February 14 was part of a special celebration commemorating the 100th season of Golden Bear basketball, as well as a recognition of the 50th anniversary of Cal's national title in 1959.\n\nOn February 28, 2009 ESPN's College Gameday made its first appearance in Berkeley broadcasting live from inside Haas Pavilion for the men's basketball game against the #18 UCLA Bruins. Cal lost despite a large turnout.\n\nOn January 21, 2009 Comcast Sportsnet Bay Area's Chronicle Live filmed their show inside Haas for the men's basketball game against Oregon, which Cal would win. Chronicle Live Host Greg Papa also called the play-by-play for the game which was televised on Comcast Sportsnet California.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867614", "title": "Cape Verdean Americans", "text": "Cape Verdean Americans\n\nCape Verdean Americans are Americans whose ancestors were Cape Verdean. In 2010, the American Community Survey stated that there were 95,003 Americans living in the US with Cape Verdean ancestors.\n\nCape Verdean immigration to the United States began in the early 19th century. The first Cape Verdean immigrants aboard New England whaling ships, which would often pick up crewmen off the coast of Cape Verde. Yankee captains valued Cape Verdeans as crews, because they “worked hard to save what they could while on board vessel they could be hired for much less money than American seamen. Furthermore, they made a disciplined crew.”\n\nThe Cape Verdeans were universally regarded as \"hardworking, honest seamen.\" When all others abandoned the old sailing ships, the Cape Verdeans bought the decrepit vessels out of their earnings as seamen and kept patching them up with loving care. Eventually, they came to own almost all that remained of the New Bedford fleet, either by purchase or by default. In some cases, they received the ships as outright gifts and \"sailed them all over the earth with their own crews and made a modest profit by whaling in the old and tried manner.\"\n\nThis Cape Verdean immigration \"trickle\" grew to a \"flood\" in the 20th century as Cape Verde suffered drought, starvation, and economic decline. Once on whaling ships and in America, Cape Verdean men were able to send home money and news of other family and friends already in “the land of opportunity.” They also sent bidons (gasoline barrels) full of food, clothes, and other items from New Bedford, Massachusetts; and Providence, Rhode Island. The latter are the oldest and largest Cape Verdean communities in the United States. These communities and new Cape Verdean communities are marked by close kinship ties and interdependence among families, a traditional Cape Verdean practice that has been passed down through the generations.\n\nOne of the major forces that brought Cape Verdeans to the Americas was the whaling industry. American whalers from New Bedford first began travelling to the islands in the 1790s, and further developed their trade as time progressed into the 19th century. During this time, many Cape Verdeans joined American whaling crews in order to escape Cape Verde, a land plagued with poor natural resources and an often abusive Portuguese colonial government. By the mid-1800s New Bedford had transformed into an economic maritime center, where Cape Verdeans were not only about to excel in the whaling industry but in other maritime industries (such as fishing) as well. New Bedford Whaling Museum explains, “As the 20th century went on and the ties between the islands and the port strengthened, entrepreneurs like Roy Teixeira, Henrique Mendes, Louis Lopes, Frank Lopes and Antonio Cardoza purchased, managed and owned packet ships like the Coriolanus, the Savoia, and the Arcturus... Importantly, not only did Cape Verdeans settle in New Bedford, but between 1860 and 1965 41% of the packets trading between New England and the Islands were owned by Cape Verdeans.”\n\nMany Cape Verdeans worked in the cranberry bogs for the cranberry industry in Southeastern Massachusetts.\n\nCape Verdean migration to the United States in the 19th century and early 20th century was composed of the islands' poorer classes. In 1922, the U.S. government restricted the immigration of peoples of color, greatly reducing Cape Verdean immigration. The new regulations also prevented Cape Verdean Americans from visiting the islands for fear of being denied reentry to the United States. The two communities thus were relatively isolated from each other for approximately 40 years. With doors to America closed, Cape Verdeans began to immigrate in larger numbers to Europe, South America, and West Africa along routes charted by commercial shipping and the Portuguese colonial empire. During the same period some Cape Verdean Americans migrated from the long-established East Coast communities to the steel towns of Ohio and Pennsylvania; and to California.\n\nIn 1966, due to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the U.S. government relaxed its regulations, and a new wave of Cape Verdean immigration began. The new arrivals in Boston, Brockton, Taunton and Onset, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; Waterbury, Connecticut; Brooklyn, and Yonkers, New York; and other communities on the East Coast met a Cape Verdean-American ethnic group whose members looked like them, but differed culturally. Separated for so long, the groups knew little of each other's recent history or treasured memories.\n\nFull independence was achieved by Cape Verde on July 5, 1975 after a long struggle for complete rights and unrestricted control from the struggle of the country's colonial past. Though growing nationalism, prior efforts for independence slowly gained momentum and territory led by the efforts of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). This newfound independence allowed a new path that would be essential to the migration of Cape Verdean American as Cape Verde was one of few African countries allowing overflight of European and U.S. air travel. This was accompanied by two further actions of independence that aided Cape Verdean migration: broken political unity between Guinea in 1980, and the election of Antonio Monteiro which brought economic struggles that incited emigration.\n\nThe states with the largest population of Cape Verdeans (as of 2010) were:\n\n\nThe largest communities of Cape Verdeans (as of 2010) were:\n\nCape Verdean immigration continues to this day. Dorchester, Massachusetts; Brockton, Massachusetts; Taunton, Massachusetts; New Bedford, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and Onset, Massachusetts are the fastest-growing new immigrant communities in the United States.\n\nThere are an estimated 265,000 Cape Verdean immigrants and their descendants living in the United States, according to a June 2007 article in \"The New York Times\". \nCape Verdean Americans reside mostly in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\nSome Cape Verdeans also settled in the Midwestern United States, Florida and California. \n\nThe Cape Verdeans suffered discrimination when they came to America. Cape Verdeans retained a unique culture apart from the groups of Afro Americans who were the descendants of slaves in the United States. This was especially true for those who settled outside the Cape Verde environments concentrated in New England, and settled in the Midwest. Due to their Catholic religion, most Cape Verdeans were related to other Catholics, who were mostly white. The Cape Verdeans maintained their own ethnic identity and lived in separate communities from other Afro American groups. However, during the civil rights struggles of the 60s, the Cape Verdeans saw similarities between their own struggle and that of African Americans and emerged a sense of solidarity with them. While some islands have a heavy European-descended population, most Cape Verdeans have African ancestry mixed with European and Moorish Jews. Because later people from all over the world settled in Cape Verde, not only Europeans, the population is one of the most unusual ethnic melting pots in the world. Due to this uniqueness, most Cape Verdeans choose to cite \"Cape Verdean\" as their race, which not only reflects a strong sense of Patriotism, but a sense of community that is only found among Cape Verdeans regardless of skin-tone.\n\nFor well over a century, the U.S. has hosted the largest proportion of the worldwide Cape Verdean diaspora residing in any one nation.\n\nOne important consequence of the technological development in recent decades has been the emergence of Cape Verdean transnationalism on the Internet. Sónia Melo discusses how Cape Verdean websites have become important for linking diaspora communities with each other, for maintaining ties with Cape Verde, and for the local politics of emigrant communities in their countries of residence.\n\nAdditionally, most Cape Verdeans have a lighter skin color than Africans from the continent. This partially comes from the fact that in the beginning, Portuguese encouraged miscegenation between Portuguese colonizers and the members of African colonies throughout their empire (with the government often rewarding soldiers and officials with monetary or land benefits if they married indigenous people). Also, the prime location and solidarity found in the island allowed for interracial relationships to develop without traditional suppression. As a result, when it comes to hair textures, skin and eye colores there are a wide variety ranging from blue and blond eyes on the islands of Fogo and Brava, to crisp and darker shades on the island of Santiago. Yet it is not uncommon for nuclear families to have a variety of tones and textures for members. The uniqueness of Cape Verdeans is reflected in the Massachusetts census permitting a \"Cape-Verdean\" check-box for ethnic identification.\n\nGenerally, Cape Verdean Americans speak English, Portuguese, and Kriolu (or Crioulo). The Creole language is a mixture of Portuguese and the native African tongues spoken by slaves. Although much of the vocabulary stems from Portuguese, many of these words were no longer used in twentieth-century Portugal. The African tongues, mostly Mande, influenced Kriolu chiefly. Since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent of Portugal in 1975, Kriolu has become the dominant language among the islanders.\n\nCreole has not received official status nor has it been standardized across the country. Several scholars note that this is difficult to do given that there is substantial dialectical variation between the islands. This can be seen from migrants who left Cape Verde often identifying more with their island of origin than the archipelago as a whole. Language, food and music are the most important cultural markers of CV identity.\n\nThe Cape Verdean Creole Institute was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1996, to teach the Cape Verdean language. In addition, many schools in the Boston Public School district offer Cape Verdean Creole (CVC) as a language class. Currently 2.3% of the population of Boston speaks CVC.\n\nFormal CVC language research in both Cape Verde and America has been ongoing since the late 1800s. The elite class of the island was mostly responsible for recording the earlier studies of the language in an attempt to make CVC more acceptable as an artistic language. When the first printing press came to Cape Verde in 1842, the elites began publishing written work in CVC for the first time. Additionally, the Seminary of São Nicolau was created in 1866, which allowed for the elite mixed race and the black elite to have access to education and begin a scholarly debate about CVC. These developments, along with other improvements in technology, allowed the study of CVC to flourish in Cape Verde.\n\nIn general, there are two different schools of thought on CVC research. One school of thought is \"Creole Exceptionalism\", which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language. Another school of thought however is referred to as \"Crioulidade\", which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents of this school of thought argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the \"Exceptionalism\" school of thought suggests.\n\nDue to a history of Portuguese colonization, the vast majority of Cape Verdeans and Cape Verdean Americans are Roman Catholic. Early Cape Verdean migrants to the United States originally joined Portuguese parishes that had sprung up throughout Southeastern Massachusetts. Cape Verdeans also began to establish their own masses in Criolu at many Massachusetts Catholic Churches. One such church is the St. Patrick's Church of Roxbury which has held a mass in Criolu for years. However, many Cape Verdean Catholics encountered racial prejudice amongst Portuguese parishioners and looked for religious alternatives. In New Bedford, the Cape Verdean community established the Our Lady of Assumption, the first Cape Verdean American church, in 1905 in response to such prejudice.\n\nFurthermore, in spite of colonial ties to Catholicism and the Portuguese, many Cape Verdeansin turned towards Protestantism in response to discrimination and a lack of support from the Archdiocese. In response to racism from the Portuguese community in Providence, the Cape Verdean community founded the Shelmer Street Church in 1905. Cape Verdeans in New Bedford at the turn of the 20th century were rejected by Portuguese parishioners at St. John's and turned towards Nazarene sects.\n\nThe mythic Daddy Grace also started his first church among a Cape Verdean community in Wareham, Massachusetts in response to rejection by Portuguese Catholics. In addition to Daddy Grace, who later founded a national religious movement, the United House of Prayer for All People, around his cult of personality, the Cape Verdean Protestant community has produced another religious leader of national acclaim, Reverend Peter J. Gomes. Today, a greater proportion of newly arrived Cape Verdean immigrants to the United States identify as Protestant due to an increased presence of evangelical missionaries in Cape Verde following its independence.\n\nWhile Christianity is the dominant ideology of Cape Verdeans in Cape Verde and the diaspora, there has been an interest in the Jewish ancestry of Cape Verdeans amongst Cape Verdean Americans. The Cape Verdean Jewish Heritage movement is mainly led by the diaspora and its interest is predominantly in preserving history, not practicing doctrine. Accordingly, one of the major goals of the movement is preservation of Jewish cemeteries in Cape Verde. A manifestation of this interest is the annual Cape Verdean - Jewish Passover Seder held in Roxbury, Massachusetts since 2005 The Seder brings together Cape Verdean and Jewish Americans in a celebration of both cultures. The traditional Seder is adapted with a bilingual Haggadah that includes Criolu prayers and elements of Cape Verdean history, such as the addition of Amilcar's Cup.\n\nCape Verdean music has evolved to be composed of diverse styles and genres that reflect its mixture of racial identities, such as: African, Portuguese, Caribbean and Brazilian influences. Older styles include \"morna\" and \"coladeira\". These styles, though distinct, carry a commonality of somber, slow, and soulful tone that often reflects themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Re-emerging forms of Caper Verdean Music are \"funaná\" and \"batuque\". These quick tempo, percussion filled styles are high energy songs that are typically accompanied by hip-moving dance. These styles were banned previously due to overly sexual allegations but are now re-emerging in the past decade. \"Hip hop\", \"Reggae\" and \"Zouk\" are styles of Cape Verdean music that are now being explored. These fusions with contemporary styles of music are often reflective in lyrics with ongoing themes of Cape Verdean life.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1867617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867617", "title": "Komar and Melamid", "text": "Komar and Melamid\n\nKomar and Melamid is a tandem team of Russian-born American conceptualist artists Vitaly Komar (born 1943) and Alexander Melamid (born 1945). In an artists' statement they said that \"even if only one of us creates some of the projects and works, we usually sign them together. We are not just an artist, we are a movement.\" Both artists were born in Moscow, but emigrated to Israel in 1977 and subsequently to New York in 1978. The pair's co-authorship of works ceased in 2003–2004.\n\nKomar and Melamid attended the Moscow Art School from 1958 to 1960, followed by the Stroganov Institute of Art and Design (Illustration dept.), graduating in 1967. They began working together shortly thereafter. After 36 years they separated in 2003.\n\nKomar & Melamid's first joint exhibition, \"Retrospectivism,\" was held at the Blue Bird Cafe in Moscow, 1967. The following year, they joined the youth section of the Moscow Union of Artists and began teaching art. In 1972, Komar & Melamid founded a movement they called \"Sots Art,\" a unique version of Soviet Pop and Conceptual Art that combines the principles of Dadaism and Socialist Realism.\" In 1974, they were arrested during a performance (in a Moscow apartment) of \"Art Belongs to the People\". Later that year, their \"Double Self-Portrait\" (similar to dual portraits of Lenin and Stalin) was destroyed by the Soviet government, along with works by other nonconformist artists, at what became known as the \"Bulldozer Exhibition\" (because bulldozers were used to destroy the artwork, which had been displayed in an open-air setting).\n\nIn 1976, Komar & Melamid's work became more widely known. Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, hosted their first international exhibition, but Soviet authorities denied them permission to attend. In 1976, they also made their first attempt at emigrating, but permission was denied. In response, they created their own country, \"Trans-State,\" complete with passports and a constitution. In 1977, they received permission to join relatives in Israel. In 1978, they moved to New York; in the same month, their first museum exhibition opened at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Komar & Melamid also worked in a style they called \"Post-Art,\" pioneering the use of multi-stylistic images, prefiguring the eclectic combination of styles in post-modernism, which became popular in the 1980s. They collaborated on various conceptual projects, ranging from painting and performance to installation, public sculpture, photography, music, and poetry. In one such performance, they established a corporation, Komar & Melamid, Inc., that had as its purpose \"the buying and selling of human souls.\" They bought several hundred souls, including Andy Warhol's (who sold it to them for free), which was smuggled into Russia and then sold for 30 rubles.\n\nMelamid moved to New Jersey in 1980. He continued to work with Komar in New York. In 1981, their \"Portrait of Hitler\" was slashed by an ex-Trotskyist disc jockey in Brooklyn. They did not repair the work, considering the attacker a co-author.\n\nRonald Feldman hosted the exhibition \"Sots Art\" in 1982, which was a commercial and critical success. In 1983, the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased paintings. From 1981 to 1983, they continued to develop Sots Art in the series Nostalgic Socialist Realism, and from 1984 to 1990 they further developed Post-Art in the Diary Series, Anarchistic Synthesis Series, and Bayonne, N.J. Series.\nThroughout the 1980s, many prominent writers and critics discussed their work, and they were invited to participate in numerous exhibitions. They were the first Russian artists to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. They were also the first Russian artists to be invited to Documenta (Kassel, then in West Germany, 1987).\n\nKomar & Melamid created their first public art sculpture in 1986, a bronze bust of Joseph Stalin, which was installed in the red light district of The Hague, Netherlands. In 1988, they became US citizens. In 1989, a monograph about them, written by Carter Ratcliff, was published by Abbeville Press.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Komar & Melamid created two icons for the Holy Rosary Church in Jersey City. In 1992, they began the series Monumental Propaganda, in response to the destruction of Socialist Realist monuments in Russia. At Komar & Melamid's invitation, more than 200 Russian and Western artists created projects for the preservation of monuments. Prolific press coverage of the project forestalled destruction of monuments in Russia.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1997, the artists worked on the series People's Choice, whereby they created the \"most wanted\" and \"least wanted\" paintings of various countries based on the results of surveys conducted by professional polling companies. The book, \"Painting by Numbers: Komar & Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art\", published in 1997, explains the statistical underpinnings of the polling process and provides the results of each country's preferences. Komar & Melamid used the same process in 1996–1997 in a collaboration with composer Dave Soldier to create \"The People's Choice Music\", consisting of \"The Most Wanted Song\" (a love song with low male and female vocals, of moderate duration, pitch, and tempo) and \"The Most Unwanted Song\" (in part: an operatic soprano raps over cowboy music featuring least-wanted instruments bagpipes and tuba while children sing about holidays and advertise for Wal-Mart).\nIn 1998, \"Naked Revolution\", an opera about George Washington, Vladimir Lenin and Marcel Duchamp, was created by Komar & Melamid with Dave Soldier and performed at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and the Kitchen, New York. It became part of the exhibition \"American Dreams\", along with a series of eight paintings, forty collages, and the artists' collection of George Washington memorabilia.\n\nIn 1998, the artists also went to Thailand to teach elephants to paint, resulting in the book, \"When Elephants Paint: The Quest of Two Russian Artists to Save the Elephants of Thailand\". In 2000, Christie's auction house held the first-ever auction of elephant paintings. The revenue generated supported the elephants and their keepers.\n\nIn 2001, Komar & Melamid began work on their last major project together, Symbols of the Big Bang, first exhibited at the Yeshiva University Museum, Center for Jewish History, New York. Using abstract symbols, the artists explored their spirituality and the connection between mysticism and science. In 2003, they began to turn some of the symbols into stained glass, which Russian authorities refused to exhibit during the Moscow portion of the exhibition, \"Berlin-Moscow/Moscow-Berlin\" (2004). Komar & Melamid ceased collaborating in 2003.\n\nThey are perhaps best known as the founders of SotsArt (СоцАрт), a form of Soviet Nonconformist Art that combined elements of Socialist Realism and Western Pop Art in a conceptual framework that also references Dadaism. Komar and Melamid often create many works within a common theme. Their prolific collaboration precludes from mentioning all of their projects, however, some of their best known series and projects are: Sots Art series (1972–1973), Post-Art series (1973), Ancestral Portraits series (1980), Nostalgic Socialist Realism series (1982–1983), Diary series (1984–1986), Anarchistic Synthesism series (1985–1986), Most-Wanted series (1993–1997), Monumental Propaganda (1994), Elephant Project (1995–2000), American Dreams (1994–1999).\n\nKomar and Melamid's People's Choice series, 1994–1997, consisted of the \"most wanted\" and \"most unwanted\" paintings of 11 countries, as well as two songs in the same vein. The artists commissioned polling companies in the 11 countries—including the United States, Russia, China, France, and Kenya—to conduct scientific polls to discover what they want to see in art. The use of polls was meant to mimic the American democratic process. Komar said, \"Our interpretation of polls is our collaboration with various people of the world. It is a collaboration with [sic] new dictator—Majority.\" The process was also meant to change the artists role as a leader. Komar and Melamid believe that the broad public is an adequate judge of art, contrary to the historical precedence, much in the same way that the broad public in America is entrusted with electing the President. It is a new type of leader, one that asks questions, instead of a dictator. Melamid said, \"Picasso mimicked Stalin, so we try to mimic Clinton.\"\n\nKomar has said he isn't so concerned that people actually enjoy the work, so long as it provokes thoughts of free will versus predetermination. To tie that concept into their earlier work, Komar said, \"In our early work, we arrived at [the] definition of freedom that entailed being free from individual cliches, being free to change intonations and styles. Individuality lost its stability and its uniqueness. Now we are searching for a new freedom. We have been traveling to different countries, engaging in dull negotiations with representatives of polling companies, raising money for further polls, receiving more of less [the] same results, and painting more or less [the] same blue landscapes. Looking for freedom, we found slavery.\"\n\nA musical version of The People's Choice was produced with composer Dave Soldier resulting in The Most Unwanted Song.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867619", "title": "Organotin chemistry", "text": "Organotin chemistry\n\nOrganotin compounds or stannanes are chemical compounds based on tin with hydrocarbon substituents. Organotin chemistry is part of the wider field of organometallic chemistry. The first organotin compound was diethyltin diiodide ((CH)SnI), discovered by Edward Frankland in 1849. The area grew rapidly in the 1900s, especially after the discovery of the Grignard reagents, which are useful for producing Sn-C bonds. The area remains rich with many applications in industry and continuing activity in the research laboratory.\n\nOrganotin compounds are generally classified according to their oxidation states. Tin(IV) compounds are much more common and more useful.\n\nThe tetraorgano derivatives are invariably tetrahedral. Compounds of the type SnRR'R\"R\"' have been resolved into individual enantiomers.\n\nOrganotin chlorides have the formula RSnCl for values of \"n\" up to 3. Bromides, iodides, and fluorides are also known but less important. These compounds are known for many R groups. They are always tetrahedral. The tri- and dihalides form adducts with good Lewis bases such as pyridine. The fluorides tend to associate such that dimethyltin difluoride forms sheet-like polymers. Di- and especially triorganotin halides, e.g. tributyltin chloride, exhibit toxicities approaching that of hydrogen cyanide.\n\nOrganotin hydrides have the formula RSnH for values of \"n\" up to 4. The parent member of this series, stannane (SnH), is an unstable colourless gas. Stability is correlated with the number of organic substituents. Tributyltin hydride is used as a source of hydride radical in some organic reactions.\n\nOrganotin oxides and hydroxides are common products from the hydrolysis of organotin halides. Unlike the corresponding derivatives of silicon and germanium, tin oxides and hydroxides often adopt structures with penta- and even hexacoordinated tin centres, especially for the diorgano- and monoorgano derivatives. The group Sn-O-Sn is called a stannoxane. Structurally simplest of the oxides and hydroxides are the triorganotin derivatives. A commercially important triorganotin hydroxides is the acaricide Cyhexatin (also called Plictran), (CH)SnOH. Such triorganotin hydroxides exist in equilibrium with the distannoxanes:\n\nWith only two organic substituents on each Sn centre, the diorganotin oxides and hydroxides are structurally more complex than the triorgano derivatives. The simple geminal diols (RSn(OH)) and monomeric stannanones (RSn=O) are unknown. Diorganotin oxides (RSnO) are polymers except when the organic substituents are very bulky, in which case cyclic trimers or, in the case of R = CH(SiMe) dimers, with SnO and SnO rings. The distannoxanes exist as dimers of dimers with the formula [RSnX]O wherein the X groups (e.g., chloride, hydroxide, carboxylate) can be terminal or bridging (see Table). The hydrolysis of the monoorganotin trihalides has the potential to generate stannanoic acids, RSnO2H. As for the diorganotin oxides/hydroxides, the monoorganotin species form structurally complex because of the occurrence of dehydration/hydration, aggregation. Illustrative is the hydrolysis of butyltin trichloride to give [(BuSn)O(OH)].\n\nUnlike carbon(IV) analogues but somewhat like silicon compounds, tin(IV) can also be coordinated to five and even six atoms instead of the regular four. These hypercoordinated compounds usually have electronegative substituents. Numerous examples of hypervalency are provided by the organotin oxides and associated carboxylates and related pseudohalide derivatives. The organotin halides for adducts, e.g. MeSnCl(bipyridine).\n\nThe all-organic penta- and hexaorganostannates have even been characterized, while in the subsequent year a six-coordinated tetraorganotin compound was reported. A crystal structure of room-temperature stable (in argon) all-carbon pentaorganostannane was reported as the lithium salt with this structure:\n\nIn this distorted trigonal bipyramidal structure the carbon to tin bond lengths (2.26 Å apical, 2.17 Å equatorial) are larger than regular C-Sn bonds (2.14 Å) reflecting its hypervalent nature.\n\nSome reactions of triorganotin halides implicate a role for R3Sn+ intermediates. Such cations are analogous to carbocations. They have been characterized crystallographically when the organic substituents are large, such as 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl.\n\nTin radicals, with the formula RSn, are called stannyl radicals. They are invoked as intermediates in certain atom-transfer reactions. For example, tributyltin hydride (tri-n-butylstannane) serves as a useful source of \"hydrogen atoms\" because of the stability of the tributytin radical.\n\nOrganotin(II) compounds are somewhat rare. Compounds with the empirical formula SnR are somewhat fragile and exist as rings or polymers when R is not bulky. The polymers, called polystannanes, have the formula (SnR).\n\nIn principle divalent tin compounds might be expected to form analogues of alkenes with a formal double bond. Indeed, compounds with the formula SnR, called distannenes, are known for certain organic substituents. The Sn centres tend to be highly pyramidal. Monomeric compounds with the formula SnR, analogues of carbenes are also known in a few cases. One example is Sn(SiR), where R is the very bulky CH(SiMe) (Me = methyl). Such species reversibly dimerize to the distannylene upon crystallization:\n\nStannenes, compounds with tin–carbon double bonds, are exemplified by derivatives of stannabenzene. Stannoles, structural analogs of cyclopentadiene, exhibit little C-Sn double bond character.\n\nCompounds of Sn(I) are rare and only observed with very bulky ligands. One prominent family of cages is accessed by pyrolysis of the 2,6-diethylphenyl-substituted tristannylene [Sn(CH-2,6-Et)], which affords the cubane-type cluster and a prismane. These cages contain Sn(I) and have the formula [Sn(CH-2,6-Et)] where n = 8, 10. A stannyne contains a carbon to tin triple bond and a distannyne a triple bond between two tin atoms (RSnSnR). Distannynes only exist for extremely bulky substituents. Unlike alkynes, the C-Sn-Sn-C core of these distannynes are nonlinear, although they are planar. The Sn-Sn distance is 3.066(1) Å, and the Sn-Sn-C angles are 99.25(14)°. Such compounds are prepared by reduction of bulky aryltin(II) halides.\nOrganotin compounds can be synthesised by numerous methods. Classic is the reaction of a Grignard reagent with tin halides for example tin tetrachloride. An example is provided by the synthesis of tetraethyltin:\n\nThe symmetrical tetraorganotin compounds, especially tetraalkyl derivatives, can then be converted to various mixed chlorides by redistribution reactions (also known as the \"Kocheshkov comproportionation\" in the case of organotin compounds):\nA related method involves redistribution of tin halides with organoaluminium compounds.\n\nThe mixed organo-halo tin compounds can be converted to the mixed organic derivatives, as illustrated by the synthesis of dibutyldivinyltin:\n\nThe organotin hydrides are generated by reduction of the mixed alkyl chlorides. For example, treatment of dibutyltin dichloride with lithium aluminium hydride gives the dibutyltin dihydride, a colourless distillable oil:\nThe Wurtz-like coupling of alkyl sodium compounds with tin halides yields tetraorganotin compounds.\n\nHydrostannylation involves the metal-catalyzed addition of tin hydrides across unsaturated substrates.\n\nImportant reactions, discussed above, usually focus on organotin halides and pseudohalides with nucleophiles. In the area of organic synthesis, the Stille reaction is considered important. It entails coupling reaction with sp2-hybridized organic halides catalyzed by palladium:\n\nand organostannane additions (nucleophilic addition of an allyl-, allenyl-, or propargylstannanes to an aldehydes and imines). Organotin compounds are also used extensively in radical chemistry (e.g. radical cyclizations, Barton–McCombie deoxygenation, Barton decarboxylation, etc.).\n\nAn organotin compound is commercially applied as stabilizers in polyvinyl chloride. In this capacity, they suppress degradation by removing allylic chloride groups and by absorbing hydrogen chloride. This application consumes about 20,000 tons of tin each year. The main class of organotin compounds are diorganotin dithiolates with the formula RSn(SR'). The Sn-S bond is the reactive component. Diorganotin carboxylates, e.g., dibutyltin dilaurate, are used as catalysts for the formation of polyurethanes, for vulcanization of silicones, and transesterification.\n\nn-Butyltin trichloride is used in the production of tin dioxide layers on glass bottles by chemical vapor deposition.\n\n\"Tributyltins\" are used as industrial biocides, e.g. as antifungal agents in textiles and paper, wood pulp and paper mill systems, breweries, and industrial cooling systems. Triphenyltin derivatives are used as active components of antifungal paints and agricultural fungicides. Other triorganotins are used as miticides and acaricides. Tributyltin oxide has been extensively used as a wood preservative.\n\nTributyltin compounds were once widely used as marine anti-biofouling agents to improve the efficiency of ocean-going ships. Concerns over toxicity of these compounds (some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter) led to a worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization.\n\nOrganotin complexes have been studied in anticancer therapy.\n\nThe toxicities of tributyltin and triphenyltin derivatives compounds are comparable to that of hydrogen cyanide. Furthermore, tri-\"n\"-alkyltins are phytotoxic and therefore cannot be used in agriculture. Depending on the organic groups, they can be powerful bactericides and fungicides. Reflecting their high bioactivity, \"tributyltins\" were once used in marine anti-fouling paint.\n\nIn contrast to the triorganotin compounds, monoorgano, diorgano- and tetraorganotin compounds are far less dangerous.\n\nDBT may however be immunotoxic.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1867624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867624", "title": "Lime (material)", "text": "Lime (material)\n\nLime is a calcium-containing inorganic mineral composed primarily of oxides, and hydroxide, usually calcium oxide and/ or calcium hydroxide. It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal-seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The word \"lime\" originates with its earliest use as building mortar and has the sense of \"sticking or adhering\".\n\nThese materials are still used in large quantities as building and engineering materials (including limestone products, cement, concrete, and mortar), as chemical feedstocks, and for sugar refining, among other uses. Lime industries and the use of many of the resulting products date from prehistoric times in both the Old World and the New World. Lime is used extensively for wastewater treatment with ferrous sulfate.\n\nThe rocks and minerals from which these materials are derived, typically limestone or chalk, are composed primarily of calcium carbonate. They may be cut, crushed, or pulverized and chemically altered. \"Burning\" (calcination) of these minerals in a lime kiln converts them into the highly caustic material \"burnt lime\", \"unslaked lime\" or \"quicklime\" (calcium oxide) and, through subsequent addition of water, into the less caustic (but still strongly alkaline) \"slaked lime\" or \"hydrated lime\" (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)), the process of which is called \"slaking of lime\".\n\nWhen the term is encountered in an agricultural context, it usually refers to agricultural lime, which today is usually crushed limestone, not a product of a lime kiln. Otherwise it most commonly means slaked lime, as the more dangerous form is usually described more specifically as quicklime or \"burnt lime\".\n\nIn the lime industry, \"limestone\" is a general term for rocks that contain 80% or more of calcium or magnesium carbonate, including marble, chalk, oolite, and marl. Further classification is done by composition as high calcium, argillaceous (clayey), silicious, conglomerate, magnesian, dolomite, and other limestones. Uncommon sources of lime include coral, sea shells, calcite and ankerite.\n\nLimestone is extracted from quarries or mines. Part of the extracted stone, selected according to its chemical composition and optical granulometry, is calcinated at about in different types of lime kilns to produce quicklime according to the reaction: \n\nBefore use, quicklime is hydrated, that is combined with water, called slaking, so hydrated lime is also known as slaked lime, and is produced according to the reaction: \n\n\"Dry slaking\" is when quicklime is slaked with just enough water to hydrate the quicklime, but remain as a powder and is referred to as hydrated lime. In \"wet slaking\", a slight excess of water is added to hydrate the quicklime to a form referred to as lime putty.\nBecause lime has an adhesive property with bricks and stones, it is often used as binding material in masonry works. It is also used in whitewashing as wall coat to adhere the whitewash onto the wall.\n\nThe process by which limestone (calcium carbonate) is converted to quicklime by heating, then to slaked lime by hydration, and naturally reverts to calcium carbonate by carbonation is called the \"lime cycle\". The conditions and compounds present during each step of the lime cycle have a strong influence of the end product, thus the complex and varied physical nature of lime products.\n\nAn example is when slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) is mixed into a thick slurry with sand and water to form mortar for building purposes. When the masonry has been laid, the slaked lime in the mortar slowly begins to react with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (limestone) according to the reaction: \nThe carbon dioxide that takes part in this reaction is principally available in the air or dissolved in rainwater so pure lime mortar will not recarbonate under water or inside a thick masonry wall.\n\nThe lime cycle for dolomitic and magnesium lime is not well understood but more complex because the magnesium compounds also slake to periclase which slake more slowly than calcium oxide and when hydrated produce several other compounds thus these limes contain inclusions of portlandite, brucite, magnesite, and other magnesium hydroxycarbonate compounds. These magnesium compounds have very limited, contradictory research which questions whether they \"...may be significantly reactive with acid rain, which could lead to the formation of magnesium sulfate salts.\" Magnesium sulfate salts may damage the mortar when they dry and recrystalize due to expansion of the crystals as they form which is known as sulfate attack.\n\nLime used in building materials is broadly classified as \"pure\", \"hydraulic\", and \"poor\" lime; can be \"natural\" or \"artificial\"; and may be further identified by its magnesium content such as dolomitic or magnesium lime. Uses include lime mortar, lime plaster, lime render, lime-ash floors, tabby concrete, whitewash, silicate mineral paint, and limestone blocks which may be of many types. The qualities of the many types of processed lime affect how they are used. The Romans used two types of lime mortar to make Roman concrete, which allowed them to revolutionize architecture, sometimes called the Concrete revolution.\n\nLime has many complex qualities as a building product including workability which includes cohesion, adhesion, air content, water content, crystal shape, board-life, spreadability, and flowability; bond strength; comprehensive strength; setting time; sand-carrying capacity; hydrolocity; free lime content; vapor permeability; flexibility; and resistance to sulfates. These qualities are affected by many factors during each step of manufacturing and installation, including the original ingredients of the source of lime; added ingredients before and during firing including inclusion of compounds from the fuel exhaust; firing temperature and duration; method of slaking including a hot mix (quicklime added to sand and water to make mortar), dry slaking and wet slaking; ratio of the mixture with aggregates and water; the sizes and types of aggregate; contaminants in the mixing water; workmanship; and rate of drying during curing.\n\nPure lime is also known as rich, common, air, slaked, slack, pickling, hydrated, and high calcium lime. It consists primarily of calcium hydroxide which is derived by slaking quicklime (calcium oxide), and may contain up to 5% of other ingredients. Pure lime sets very slowly through contact with carbon dioxide in the air and moisture; it is not a hydraulic lime so it will not set under water. Pure lime is pure white and can be used for whitewash, plaster, and mortar. Pure lime is soluble in water containing carbonic acid, a natural, weak acid which is a solution of carbon dioxide in water and acid rain so it will slowly wash away, but this characteristic also produces autogenous or self-healing process where the dissolved lime can flow into cracks in the material and be redeposited, automatically repairing the crack.\n\nSemi-hydraulic lime, also called partially hydraulic and grey lime, sets initially with water and then continues to set with air. This lime is similar to hydraulic lime but has less soluble silica (usually minimum 6%) and aluminates, and will set under water but will never harden.\n\nHydraulic lime is also called \"water lime\". Hydraulic lime contains lime with silica or alumina and sets with exposure to water and can set under water. \"Natural hydraulic lime\" (NHL) is made from a limestone which naturally contains some clay. \"Artificial hydraulic lime\" is made by adding forms of silica or alumina such as clay to the limestone during firing, or by adding a pozzolana to pure lime. Hydraulic limes are classified by their strength: \"feebly\", \"moderately\" and \"eminently\" hydraulic lime. Feebly hydraulic lime contains 5-10% clay, slakes in minutes, and sets in about three weeks. It is used for less expensive work and in mild climates. Moderately hydraulic lime contains 11-20% clay, slakes in one to two hours, and sets in approximately one week. It is used for better quality work and exterior walls in freezing climates. Eminently hydraulic lime contains 21-30% clay, slakes very slowly, and sets in approximately a day. It is used in harsh environments such as damp locations and near saltwater. Hydraulic lime is off-white in color. \"The degree of hydraulicity of mortars will affect many characteristics. By selecting an appropriate ratio of clay to limestone mortars that carbonate or set hydraulically to a varying extents can be designed for particular application requirements such as setting time, strength, colour, durability, frost resistance, workability, speed of set in the presence of water, vapour permeability etc.\"\n\nPoor lime is also known as lean or meager lime. Poor lime sets and cures very slowly and has weak bonding. Poor lime is grey in color.\n\nMagnesium lime contains more than 5% magnesium oxide (BS 6100) or 5-35% magnesium carbonate (ASTM C 59-91). Dolomitic lime has a high magnesium content of 35-46% magnesium carbonate (ASTM C 59-91). Dolomitic lime is named for the Dolomite Mountains in the Italian and Austrian Alps.\n\nIn the United States the most commonly used masonry lime is Type S hydrated lime which is intended to be added to Portland cement to improve plasticity, water retention and other qualities. The S in type S stands for special which distinguishes it from Type N hydrated lime where the N stands for normal. The special attributes of Type S are its \"...ability to develop high, early plasticity and higher water retentivity and by a limitation on its unhydrated oxide content.\" The term Type S originated in 1946 in ASTM C 207 Hydrated Lime for Masonry Purposes. Type S lime is almost always dolomitic lime, hydrated under heat and pressure in an autoclave, and used in mortar, render, stucco, and plaster. Type S lime is not considered reliable as a pure binder in mortar due to high burning temperatures during production.\n\nKankar lime, a lime made from kankar which is a form of calcium carbonate.\n\nSelenitic lime, also known as Scotts' cement after Henry Young Darracott Scott is a cement of grey chalk or similar lime, such as in the Lias Group, with about 5% added gypsum plaster (calcined gypsum). Selenite is a type of gypsum, but selenitic cement may be made using any form of sulfate or sulfuric acid. Sulfate arrests slaking, causes the cement to set quickly and stronger.\n\nThe Romans made concrete by mixing lime and volcanic ash to create a pozzolanic reaction. If this was mixed with volcanic tuff and placed under seawater, the seawater hydrated the lime in an exothermic reaction that solidified the mixture.\n\n\n\n"}

An eccentric and colourful figure, she was also a gifted artist, sculptor and writer, and her antics often created controversy.\n\nWood was born in Kent, England, before her parents moved to South Africa, where her father was a brewery manager and landscape painter, and was brought up in the latter country. Wood adopted her mother's maiden name in 1927 to emphasize her artistic connections. Her mother's father was the sculptor Samuel Peploe Wood, and his brother was the painter Thomas Peploe Wood. If challenged as to her Scottish birthright, she would reply, \"One does not have to be a horse to be born in a stable\", echoing the old proverb that is sometimes misattributed to the Duke of Wellington, albeit for a different purpose.\n\nIn 1928 Wood was one of the founders of the National Party of Scotland, which grew into the Scottish National Party, but, in the 1930s, decided that a non-party approach to Scottish independence was more effective. On Bannockburn Day in 1932, Wood led a group of nationalists into Stirling Castle, then an Army barracks as well as being open to tourists, to tear down the Union Flag and replace it with Scotland's lion rampant. Eric Linklater wrote that she flushed the Union Jack down the toilet, and she sued him for libel, eventually settling out of court for a farthing damages.\n\nIn the 1930s Wood also founded the Scottish Watch, a youth organisation (not to be confused with a later, unrelated extremist organisation of the same name). In 1949, she had founded the Scottish Patriots, which, at the time of her death in June 1981, were some 2,000 strong.\n\nIn the 1950s came protests against the use of the regnal title \"Elizabeth II\" in Scotland, as Scotland had not had an Elizabeth I (see also the case of \"MacCormick v. Lord Advocate\"). Wood hung an effigy of the secretary of state for Scotland in Glasgow in 1950 and displayed a Home Rule banner at that years' Highland Games. Wood was arrested and spent spells in prison on several occasions.\n\nFrom 1956 Wood shared an artist's studio and house with her partner, Florence St John Cadell at Whinmill Brae in Edinburgh. The house is now split in two and addressed as 17 and 18 Coltbridge Gardens. Wood's portrait by Florence St John Cadell is held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIn 1960, Wood spoke at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, to try to mobilise them behind the re-convening of the Scottish parliament, which she asserted had not been properly dissolved in 1707, merely adjourned. This request was turned down.\n\nWood engaged in many international campaigns, for Irish causes, to the remembrance of the British concentration camps during the Second Boer War which killed thousands, to supporting the Indian independence movement and supporting the Icelanders in their 1970s cod war over fishing grounds.\n\nIn 1972 came Wood's hunger strike for home rule, which effectively failed, but in 1979, Scots were given a referendum on the matter.\n\nIn the early 1970s Wood often read Scottish stories on the BBC children's TV programme \"Jackanory\" under the name Auntie Gwen. Having spent over a decade as a crofter in Moidart (moving to Edinburgh in 1952) she had a wide span of experience to call upon. In all she wrote ten books, the last being her autobiography, \"Yours Sincerely for Scotland\". Later in the 1970s she unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in an election to be Rector of the University of Dundee with the support of the University's Scottish Nationalist Association.\n\nWood remained active into her late eighties. She died in Edinburgh on 30 June 1981, aged 88.\n\nWood was the aunt of both the physicist J. B. Gunn and the musician Spike Hughes, and granddaughter of Samuel Peploe Wood. She was also the sister-in-law of the Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn and the musician Herbert Hughes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867633", "title": "Blast shelter", "text": "Blast shelter\n\nA blast shelter is a place where people can go to protect themselves from blasts and explosions, like those from bombs, or in hazardous worksites, such as on oil and gas refineries or petrochemical facilities. It differs from a fallout shelter, in that its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure instead of from radioactive precipitation, as a fallout shelter does. It is also possible for a shelter to protect from both blasts and fallout.\n\nBlast shelters are a vital form of protection from nuclear attack and are employed in civil defense. There are above-ground, below-ground, dedicated, dual-purpose, and potential blast shelters. Dedicated blast shelters are built specifically for the purpose of blast protection (see bunker). Dual-purpose blast shelters are existing structures with blast-protective properties that have been modified to accommodate people seeking protection from blasts. Potential blast shelters are existing structures or geological features exhibiting blast-protective properties that have potential to be used for protection from blasts.\n\nBlast shelters deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. While frame buildings collapse from as little as 3 psi (20 kPa) of overpressure, blast shelters are regularly constructed to survive several hundred psi. This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb can harm the structure.\n\nThe basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area.\n\nOnly the most heavy bedrock-shelters would stand a chance of surviving. However, in the countryside or in a suburb, the likely distance to the explosion is much larger, as it is improbable that anyone would waste an expensive nuclear device on such targets. The most common purpose-built structure is a steel-reinforced concrete vault or arch buried or located in the basement of a house.\n\nMost expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing.\n\nImprovised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 metre-wide) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex of the tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1–2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. Blast valves are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids.\n\nNuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and prompt radiation. The overburden and structure provide substantial radiation shielding, and the negative pressure is usually only 1/3 of the overpressure.\n\nThe doors must be at least as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to minimize the size and expense. In dual-purpose shelters, which have a secondary peacetime use, the door may be normal. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame welded to the steel-reinforcement of the concrete. The shelter should be located so that there is no combustible material directly outside it.\n\nIf the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. If possible, this should be avoided, and the door built so that it is sheltered from the blast wave by other structures. The most useful construction is to build the door behind a 90°-turn in a corridor that has an exit for the overpressure.\n\nA bunker commonly has two doors, one of which is convenient, and in peacetime use, and the other is strong. Naturally, the shelter must always have a secondary exit which can be used if the primary door is blocked by debris. Door shafts may double as ventilation shafts to reduce the digging, although this is inadvisable.\n\nA large ground shock can move the walls of a bunker several centimeters in a few milliseconds. Bunkers designed for large ground shocks must have sprung internal buildings, hammocks, or bean-bag chairs to protect inhabitants from the walls and floors. However, most civilian-built improvised shelters do not need these as their structure cannot stand a shock large enough to seriously damage the occupants.\n\nEarth is an excellent insulator. In bunkers inhabited for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air-conditioning must be provided to prevent heat prostration. In bunkers designed for war-time use, manually operated ventilators must be provided because supplies of electricity or gas are unreliable. The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swings in the shelter's doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling.\n\nThe flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a Kearny Air Pump, or KAP, named after the inventor Cresson Kearny.) Kearny asserts, based on field testing, that air filtration is not normally needed in a nuclear shelter. He asserts that fallout is either large enough to fall to the ground, or so fine that it will not settle and thus has little bulk to emit radiation. However, if possible, shelters should have air-filtration to stop chemical, biological and nuclear impurities which may abound after an explosion.\n\nVentilation openings in a bunker must be protected by blast valves. A blast valve is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. If the bunker is in a built-up area, it may include water-cooling or an immersion tube and breathing tubes to protect inhabitants from fire storms. In these cases, the secondary exit is also most useful.\n\nBunkers must also protect the inhabitants from normal weather, including rain, summer heat and winter cold. A normal form of rainproofing is to place plastic film on the bunker's main structure before burying it. Thick (5-mil or 125 μm), inexpensive polyethylene film serves quite well, because the overburden protects it from degradation by wind and sunlight. Naturally, a buried or basement-situated reinforced-concrete shelter usually has the normal appearance of a building.\n\nWhen a house is purpose-built with a blast shelter, the normal location is a reinforced below-grade bathroom with large cabinets. In apartment houses, the shelter may double as storage space, as long as it can be swiftly emptied for its primary use. A shelter can easily be added in a new basement construction by taking an existing corner and adding two poured walls and a ceiling.\n\nSome vendors provide true blast shelters engineered to provide good protection to individual families at modest cost. One common design approach uses fiber-reinforced plastic shells. Compressive protection may be provided by inexpensive earth arching. The overburden is designed to shield from radiation. To prevent the shelter from floating to the surface in high groundwater, some designs have a skirt held-down with the overburden. A properly designed, properly installed home shelter does not become a sinkhole in the lawn. In Switzerland, which requires shelters for private apartment blocks and large private houses, the lightest shelters are constructed of stainless steel.\n\nDuring World War II, people in London and Moscow survived German aerial bombing by taking refuge in the underground railway stations, e.g., the London Underground. In the second half of the 20th century, metro stations in eastern Europe and the USSR were constructed to serve as blast shelters.\n\nStations of the Pyongyang Metro in North Korea, constructed below ground in the 1960s and 1970s, are designed as nuclear blast shelters and each station entrance has thick steel blast doors.\n\n\n\n"}

It had an interest in ending the frequent Estonian attacks that threatened its Baltic trade. Danish fleets attacked Estonia in 1170, 1194, and 1197. In 1206, King Valdemar II and archbishop Andreas Sunonis led a raid on Ösel island (Saaremaa). The Kings of Denmark claimed Estonia, and this was recognised by the pope. In 1219 the Danish fleet landed in the major harbor of Estonia and defeated the Estonians in the Battle of Lindanise that brought Northern Estonia under Danish rule until the Estonian uprising in 1343, when the territories were taken over by the Teutonic Order. They were sold by Denmark in 1346.\n\nDuring the Livonian crusade in 1218, Pope Honorius III gave Valdemar II a free hand to annex as much land as he could conquer in Estonia. Besides, Albert of Riga, the leader of the Teutonic crusaders fighting the Estonians from the south, visited the king and asked him to attack the Estonians from the North.\n\nIn 1219, Valdemar gathered his fleet, joined forces with the Rugian navy led by prince Wizlav of Rügen, and landed on the northern coast of Estonia in the Lindanise (now Tallinn) harbor in the Estonian province of Revala. According to the legend, the national flag of Denmark \"Dannebrog\" was born at this time, falling from the sky during a critical moment in the fight and helping the Danes to win the Battle of Lindanise against the Estonians. The date of the battle, June 15, is still celebrated as \"Valdemarsdag\" (the national \"flag day\") in present-day Denmark.\n\nThe order of Livonian Brothers of the Sword had conquered Southern Estonia whilst Denmark had taken the North, and the two agreed to divide Estonia but quarreled over the exact borders. In 1220 the King of Denmark gave up his claim on the southern Estonian provinces of Sakala and Ugaunia, which had already been conquered by Brothers of the Sword. Bishop Albert ceded to Denmark the Estonian provinces of Harria, Vironia and Jerwia.\n\nIn 1227 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword conquered all Danish territories in Northern Estonia. After their defeat in the Battle of Saule, the surviving members of the order merged into the Teutonic Order of Prussia in 1237. On June 7, 1238, the Teutonic Order concluded the Treaty of Stensby at a royal fortress in the south of Zealand with the Danish king, Valdemar II. Under the treaty, Jerwia stayed part of the Ordenstaat, while Harria and Vironia were ceded back to King of Denmark as his direct dominion, the Duchy of Estonia. The first Duke of Estonia had been appointed by Valdemar II in 1220, and the title was now resumed by the kings of Denmark starting in 1269.\n\nDue to its status as the king's personal possession, the Duchy of Estonia was included in a nationwide Danish taxation list \"Liber Census Daniæ\" () (1220–41), an important geographic and historic document. The list contains about 500 Estonian place names and the names of 114 local vassals.\n\nThe capital of Danish Estonia was Reval (Tallinn), founded at the place of Lindanise after the invasion of 1219. The Danes built the fortress of Castrum Danorum at Toompea Hill. Estonians still call their capital \"Tallinn\", which, according to an urban legend, derives from \"Taani linna\" (Danish town or castle). Reval was granted Lübeck city rights (1248) and joined the Hanseatic League. Even today, Danish influence can be seen in heraldic symbols: the city of Tallinn's coat of arms features the Danish cross, while Estonia's coat of arms depicts a similar three lions to the Danish coat of arms.\n\nIn 1240 Valdemar II created the Bishopric of Reval but, contrary to canon law, reserved the right to appoint the bishops of Reval to himself and his successors as king of Denmark. The decision to simply nominate the See of Reval was unique in the whole Catholic Church at the time and was disputed by bishops and the Pope. During this period, the election of bishops was never established in Reval, and royal rights over the bishopric and to nominate the bishops were even included in the treaty when the territories were sold to Teutonic Order in 1346.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1240, the duchy was locally governed by a viceroy () appointed by the king and functioning as his plenipotentiary. The viceroy had administrative powers, he collected the taxes, and he commanded the vassals and the troops in case of war. Most of the viceroys were either of Danish or Danish-Estonian nationality.\n\nIn Vironia, the main power centers were Wesenberg (Rakvere) and Narva, built on the site of the old Estonian fortresses of \"Rakovor\" and \"Rugodiv\". Wesenberg was granted Lübeck city rights in 1302 by King Erik Menved. Narva received these rights in 1345.\n\nThe vassals of the Danish king received fiefs per \"dominum utile\" in exchange for military and court services. The vassals' oath to a new king had to be sworn for a \"year and a day\". Of the vassals, 80% were Germans from Westphalia, 18% were Danes, and 2% were Estonians (Clemens Esto, Otto Kivele, Odwardus Sorseferæ, etc.). The chronicler Ditleb Alnpeke (1290) complained that the king of Denmark was accepting Estonians as his vassals. Danish rule was more liberal in this respect than that of the Brothers of the Sword, in whose territories no natives were allowed to become lords of fiefs. In 1248, the vassals and burgers of Reval already had a local legislative body or \"ritterschaft\".\n\nThe Danish army only visited the province occasionally. In 1240–42, Denmark went to war against Novgorod and tried to extend its rule to the land of Votians. King Valdemar sent his sons Abel and Canute to support his vassals' campaign, but they did not win any new territory. The Danish king Erik Plogpennig visited Estonia in 1249, and the Danish fleet sailed to Reval in 1268 and 1270 against Russian and Lithuanian threats.\n\nIn August 1332, King Christopher II of Denmark died and Denmark fell into political turmoil. The province in Estonia became split between a pro-Danish party led by bishop Olaf of Reval and the pro-German party led by captain Marquard Breide. After the Estonians of Harria rebelled in the St. George's Night Uprising of 1343, the Teutonic Order occupied the territories. The overthrow of the Danish government came two days after the Order had put down the Estonian revolt, and the Danish viceroy was imprisoned in cooperation with the pro-German vassals. The castles in Reval and Wesenberg were handed over to the Order by the pro-German party on May 16, 1343, and the castle at Narva in 1345. In 1346 Estonia (Harria and Vironia) was sold for 19 000 Cologne marks to the Teutonic Order, notwithstanding the promise by Christopher II in 1329 never to abandon or sell Denmark's Estonian territories. The king of Denmark even made a public statement repenting for breaking that promise and asked forgiveness from the Pope. The shift of sovereignty from Denmark to the Teutonic Order took place on November 1, 1346.\n\nThe title of \"Duke of Estonia\", which had previously been held by the Danish kings, fell into disuse during the Teutonic Order era and was not revived until 1456 by the Danish King Christian I. The title was assumed by the Swedish monarchy after their conquest of Estonia during the Livonian War. The title then transferred to the Russian Tsars after their victory in the Great Northern War and continued to be a subsidiary title of the Russian Tsars until the Romanov Dynasty was overthrown in 1917 during the Russian Revolution.\n\n\n\n"}

Some were made with as many as nine handles. The multiple handles also allow hot drinks to be passed around without pain.\n\nTygs were made in large quantities at Wrotham in Kent and in many Staffordshire factories. Examples have surfaced at 17th-century American colonial sites, as well as in the UK. There are also examples of Japanese and German tygs.\n\nMany of the leading names in Staffordshire and Worcester area have manufactured miniature three handled tygs that stand proud at only 1 to 1 7/10 inches in size. Most were probably used for decoration rather than drinking, as many of them are exquisitely painted. They are widely collected.\n\nThe term 'frilly-based tyg' is used in some English archaeological literature to refer to a type of medieval and early post-medieval drinking mug or pitcher, usually wheel-thrown with a rounded belly and a straight or flared neck, which may have one or more handles. The 'frilly base' refers to the foot-ring of the mug, which after throwing was given an alternating bossed and indented form by manual shaping with fingers or thumbs. This style was popularized from c. 1300 onwards in hard-fired Rhenish wares, for example in ash-glazed wares from Siegburg, near Bonn, Germany, and later in salt-glazed wares like those from Raeren, eastern Belgium.

However, in 1956, the American and Soviet governments agreed to exchange magazines and \"Amerika\" was reborn and published in return for distribution of \"The USSR\" in the United States.\n\nThe simultaneous appearance of these magazines was the result of an intergovernmental agreement, one among several cross-cultural agreements designed to sow trust amidst the rancour of international politics. Still, there was never any question in anyone's mind that each magazine was intended as a propaganda tool for the government issuing and publishing it.\n\nA few years later, \"The USSR\" changed its name to \"Soviet Life\". While never a blatant Soviet propaganda tool, \"Soviet Life\" did hew to the government line. Yet it sought to present an informed view of Russian culture, history, scientific achievements and the various peoples inhabiting the Soviet Union.\n\nUnder the terms of the inter-governmental agreement, the subscription levels of both magazines were restricted for many years to around 30,000.\n\nIn the late 1980s, with political and economic reform in the Soviet Union, there was a surge of interest in Soviet Life -- readership rose to over 50,000.\n\nIn December 1991, the Soviet Union signed itself out of existence and, subsequently, the Russian government could not find the money to finance the production of \"Soviet Life\". The last issue of \"Soviet Life\" was published in December 1991.\n\nJust over one year later, in early 1993, through an agreement between RIA Novosti (the government press agency) and Rich Frontier Publishing, \"Soviet Life\" was reborn as \"Russian Life\". The magazine was re-initiated as a bimonthly (whereas previously \"Soviet Life\" had been a monthly magazine) and continued in that fashion, albeit with a sporadic publishing timetable, due to funding difficulties.\n\nIn July 1995, the privately owned Vermont company, Russian Information Services, Inc., purchased all rights to \"Russian Life\". Initially published as a monthly, the magazine soon settled into a bimonthly schedule. RIS has published well over 100 issues of \"Russian Life\" since 1995. Today the magazine is a 64-page colour bi-monthly magazine, with stories of Russian culture, history and life.\n\n"}

Michael Straczynski and John Romita Jr.\n\nEzekiel Sims was a rich businessman who, in his younger years, ritualistically gained powers similar to those of Spider-Man. He wanted to use his powers to be a hero, but initially used them to found a corporation, believing that he could not do anything without a base of operations, and swiftly became too busy to use his powers on a daily basis. When Spider-Man emerged, Ezekiel hired half a dozen independent private detectives to investigate Spider-Man's life, allowing him to piece together who Spider-Man was from the various pieces of information they provided to him. Felicia Hardy was one of his investigators, specifically hired to track Spider-Man's appearances in foreign countries.\n\nEzekiel, in his 50s, contacted Spider-Man and explained to him the nature of animal totems: people who gain supernatural abilities from a mystic link with certain animals. He suggested that the spider that bit Peter Parker was not mutated by the radiation, but actually trying to give Peter its powers before the radiation killed it. This meant that Spider-Man was now part of the supernatural food chain, and became a target for other totems and beings who feed on totems (Hence why so many of Spider-Man's foes were based on animals; on some level, they 'sensed' that Peter was a true totem while they were merely impostors and were thus driven to destroy him). He subsequently aided Spider-Man in fighting a being known as Morlun, a vampire-like entity that 'fed' on totems, apparently at the cost of his life, but it was later revealed that he survived and departed for Africa, where he aided Spider-Man in dealing with Shathra, another supernatural-based menace, by leading Peter to an area where he would have the advantage over Shathra.\n\nIt was revealed that a variety of supernatural menaces that Spider-Man had faced were really after Ezekiel, and Ezekiel attempted to direct the consequences of gaining his powers onto Spider-Man himself, taking Spider-Man to the temple where he had been given his powers and drawing blood to attract a massive spider that would take the 'false' totem warrior as a sacrifice. However, in his last moments, he realized that he had done nothing with his powers but help himself, while Peter had selflessly risked his life to save others again and again. With this in mind, he attacked the spider that would have eaten Peter, giving his own life to save his friend in recognition of the hero that Peter truly was, and thus gaining a chance for redemption that he would have never had again.\n\nIn \"Grim Hunt\", it appeared as if a reanimated Ezekiel (covered in spiders) appeared before Spider-Man and Arachne. Unknown to Spider-Man, the Ezekiel that appeared before him was really the Chameleon in disguise leading Spider-Man into a trap with the Kravinoffs in order to carry out the resurrection of Sergei Kravinoff, which required the blood of Spider-Man.\n\nDuring the \"Original Sin\" storyline following the murder of Uatu the Watcher, Spider-Man's exposure to Uatu's eye during the confrontation with the Orb revealed that Cindy Moon, the second person bitten by the radioactive spider that created Spider-Man, had been held in isolation by Ezekiel who gave her some training in her powers but then kept her locked in a secret room underneath his office. He also appeared to her and Spider-Man in the form of a prerecorded message telling Silk that if she leaves the lair, there is no hope for them all (likely referring to the Spider-Totems). It is also revealed that Ezekiel had kept Silk safe in her lair to prevent Morlun from finding out. Years later, Spider-Man learns about Silk and frees her from Ezekiel's bunker, allowing her to start a new life and career. This ends up triggering the multiversal hunt of all spiders as the Inheritors are now aware of Silk's existence as the \"Bride\".\n\nEzekiel possesses a number of superhuman attributes that are almost identical to those naturally possessed by Spider-Man. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reaction time, and resistance to physical injury are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Although Ezekiel is of an advanced age, none of his physical attributes have declined over the decades.\n\nEzekiel also possesses the ability to stick to most surfaces and crawl along them in the same way as Spider-Man. He also possesses a type of E.S.P. that serves as an early warning system in much the same way as Spider-Man's spider-sense, although his was not as developed as Spider-Man's. Because of their nearly identical powers, Ezekiel and Spider-Man are immune to each other's early warning system.\n\nIn addition to his powers, Ezekiel is extremely wealthy and is a highly skilled businessman and owner of a company with international connections. As with Spider-Man, he is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant though he has had no formal training. He uses a unique type of freestyle fighting that allows him to make full use of his powers. He does not seem to have any web-generating devices like Spider-Man's web-shooters, and is never seen to produce any webbing naturally. In his conversations with Peter Parker, the subject never comes up. He is knowledgeable of the mystical nature of totems, and once told Peter the legend of the first \"Spider-Man\".\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, different versions of Ezekiel are featured:\n\n\n\n"}

He patented this process in 1894 and first produced the glass for manufacture in 1896 in Queens, New York. It differs from most iridescent glasses because the color is ingrained in the glass itself, as well as having distinctive coloring. Tiffany won a grand prize at the 1900 Paris Exposition for his Favrile glass. \n\nTiffany used this glass in the stained-glass windows designed and made by his studio. His largest and most significant work using Favrile glass is \"Dream Garden\" (1916), commissioned by the Curtis Publishing Company for their headquarters in Philadelphia and designed by Maxfield Parrish. It is now owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\n\nTiffany founded his first glassmaking firm in 1892, which he called the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company. The factory, Tiffany Furnaces, was located in Corona, Queens, New York. It was managed by English immigrant Arthur J. Nash, who was skilled in glassmaking. It was here that Tiffany developed his unique method of glassmaking: treating molten glass with metallic oxides that were absorbed into the glass and created a luxurious iridescent surface effect.\n\nTiffany worked to develop this new glass after being strongly influenced by his 1865 trip to Europe. In London he visited the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum, whose extensive collection of Roman and Syrian glass made a deep impression on him. These included iridescent glass. He also admired the coloration of medieval glass and believed that he could improve on the quality of contemporary glass.\n\nAfter much experimentation and development, he received the patent for Favrile glass in 1894. He made the first Favrile objects in 1896. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Tiffany's Favrile glass won the grand prize in the exposition.\n\nFavrile is different from other iridescent glasses because its color is not just on the surface, but part of the glass. The original trade name, \"Fabrile\", was derived from an Old English word, \"fabrile\", meaning \"hand-wrought\" or handcrafted. Tiffany later changed the word to \"Favrile\", \"since this sounded better\".\n\nSome of the distinguishing colors in Favrile glass include \"Gold Lustre,\" \"Samian Red,\" \"Mazarin Blue,\" \"Tel-el-amarna\" (or Turquoise Blue), and \"Aquamarine\".\n\nFavrile was the first art glass to be used in stained-glass windows. Tiffany planned to make patterns in windows based on the shapes and color of his glass. Favrile glass also backs a large ornamental clock in Detroit's Guardian Building. The largest and most significant glass-mosaic produced with Favrile glass is likely the \"Dream Garden\" (1916), commissioned for the Curtis Publishing Company's headquarters in Philadelphia. Artist Maxfield Parrish designed the work, and Tiffany Studios executed and installed it. The work is now owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\n\n\n"}

It houses an about 40-year-old temple dedicated to the Hindu God Murugan. The temple can be reached by road from Chromepet en route to Hasthinapuram. The presiding deity is Sri Swaminathaswamy. The presiding deity in Kumaran Kundram is believed to be equivalent to the one in Swamimalai and stands atop the hillock facing north. It can be reached by a flight of about 80 steps.\n\nIn 1956, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swamigal, a twentieth-century saint and seer of the Kanchi Mutt, visited Chromepet. On looking at the hill, he proposed that a temple be built for Murugan. The temple for Siddhi Vinayagar was built in the same year. Twenty years later, while clearing the hillside for a path, a lance, the prime weapon of Lord Muruga, was found. This inspired the devotees to speed up work. The consecration of the Sri Swaminathaswamy temple was performed in 1979. Slowly, more shrines were added for Shiva, Sarabeshwara, Ambal and the Navagrahas. The temple is run by a group of trustees.\n\nA five tier Rajagopuram has been constructed recently. Though the spade work had commenced long ago, the actual construction work on the Rajagopuram commenced in 2011-12 and concluded in January 2014. Renovation and painting works have also been carried out in the temple in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam (consecration ceremony). A new Artha mandapam adjoining the Rajagopuram has been constructed. A few civil works remain to be completed(February 2014). A new Dwajasthambam (Flag Mast) has also been erected. Cultural and religious events like music, dance and discourses were held at the Arunagirinathar Hall inside the temple precincts every day for over a year in 2013-14 as a part of the Rajagopuram construction and temple renovation.\n\nReligious ceremonies connected to the consecration commenced on 3 February 2014 and the consecration was conducted between 9.00 AM and 10.30 AM IST on 9 February 2014 (Sunday) in the presence of Swami Brahmayogananda, Founder, Acharya Yoga Shanthi Gurukulam, West Mambalam, Chennai and Niranjanandagiri Swamy of Gnananandagiri Peetam, Dakshina Halasyam, Thennangur.\n\nOn the day of consecration, thousands of devotees visited the shrine and took part in the full-day festivities. Shri Vijayendra Saraswathi Swamigal, the junior seer of the Kanchi Mutt visited the shrine in the evening and offered prayers to the deities.\n\nThe presiding deity was taken in a procession in a magnificent floral palanquin in the night to the accompaniment of temple music and chants of devotees.\n\nThe monthly circumambulation of the small hill temple on the night of full moon day (Girivalam) attracts hundreds of devotees every month. The annual Soorasamhaaram festival (in October/November) is the prime festival in this temple along with Karthigai Deepam celebrations (in November/December).\n\nA large group of devotees by the name of \"Sri Padam\" are rendering regular service at the temple on voluntary basis.\n\nOpposite to the Sri Swaminathaswamy Temple (Kumaran Kundram) is a small vaishnavite temple run by a hereditary trust.

There are separate shrines for Prasanna Yoga Anjaneyar (Hanuman)and Ramanujar. The ground where this temple is built belonged to Shri. Srinivasan Thiagarajan, who gave it in exchange for another piece of land in the same locality. The temple attracts large crowds on Saturdays, New Year Eve and Vaikunta Ekadasi.

Created by Chris Carter, the series aired on Fox for three seasons with a total of sixty-seven episodes. \"Millennium\" starred Lance Henriksen, Megan Gallagher, Klea Scott, and Brittany Tiplady. Henriksen portrayed Frank Black, an offender profiler who worked for the Millennium Group, a private investigative organisation. Black retired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to move his wife (Gallagher) and daughter (Tiplady) to Seattle, where he began to consult on criminal cases for the Group. After his wife's death, he returned to the FBI to work with new partner Emma Hollis (Scott) to discredit the Group.\n\n\"Millennium\" genesis stemmed from \"Irresistible\", a second-season episode of \"The X-Files\" penned by Carter. Influence was also drawn from the works of Nostradamus, and the increasing popular interest in eschatology ahead of the coming millennium. The series began airing in the Friday timeslot formerly occupied by \"The X-Files\". \"Pilot\", the debut episode, was heavily promoted by Fox, and brought in over a quarter of the total audience during its broadcast.\n\nThe series also attracted a high degree of critical praise, earning a People's Choice Award for \"Favorite New TV Dramatic Series\" in its first year.

During this period (of years), almost everyone carried strike anywhere matches, so they could ignite stoves, lanterns and other devices. Early matches were unreliable and prone to ignite from rubbing on one another or spontaneously. Accordingly, most people carried a match safe to house their matches. Wealthy people had ‘match safes’, made of gold or silver, while common folk had ones made of tin or brass.\nThey were made throughout the world including the United Kingdom, in the U.S.A., continental Europe and Australia. Significant English makers of vesta cases included notable silversmiths such as Sampson Mordan and Asprey & Co. Significant American manufacturers of match safes include Wm. B. Kerr, Gorham, Unger Brothers, Battin, Blackington, Whiting, George Scheibler and Shreve & Co.\n\nThe different patterns and types must run into many thousands. As well as plain and decorated square, oblong and round cases, a myriad of novelty shapes have been recorded; silver, brass or white metal pigs with hinged heads were popular, as were vesta cases in the form of Mr Punch, hearts, skulls, musical instruments (often violas), owls, boots and shoes, bottles, ladies' legs and so on.\nThey were also made in a wide range of materials, including pressed brass, pressed tin, gunmetal, nickel silver, gold, bone, ivory, wood of varying types, early plastics like tortoiseshell and bakelite, and ceramics. The more unusual materials included leather and the sea bean seed from Entada gigas commonly known as the monkey-ladder, sea bean, Cœur de la Mer or Sea Heart. Although the majority were made of inexpensive materials, some were made of precious metals or enameled. These precious metal cases typically had a gold wash interior to prevent corrosion by the chemically active match heads.\nA distinguishing characteristic of match safes is that they have a ribbed surface, usually on the bottom, for lighting the matches. Some match safes incorporated a cigar cutter or a small knife blade as well. Often made to be carried in the pocket, some were small enough to be suspended from a fob chain or an Albert chain. Others were made to be left in a handy position in the home, such as the kitchen or close to a fireplace. These were usually larger than the pocket vestas, and were sometimes referred to as standing or table vestas. Pocket vestas and sovereign cases were sometimes combined into the one item.\n\nPromotional vestas were sometimes produced by different companies, e.g. champagne producers. The Gillette company produced a brass razor blade case with a ribbed bottom that could be used as a vesta case after the razor blades had been used.\n\nOccasionally a vesta case was made to double as a go-to-bed matchbox.\n\nVesta cases are still to be found in a vast array of shapes, sizes and materials, and many are extremely attractive.\n\n"}

It was released on September 23, 2002, by Ill Will Records and Columbia Records, who wanted to capitalize on what was seen in hip hop music as Nas' artistic comeback the year before. \n\nThe album compiles previously unreleased tracks that were discarded from recording sessions for Nas' previous studio albums, \"I Am...\" (1999) and \"Stillmatic\" (2001). It features production by L.E.S., The Alchemist, Poke and Tone, and Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie, among others. With low-key, sparse sounds and observational lyrics about urban life, the songs are autobiographical and nostalgic, departing from the thug persona of Nas' previous records.\n\nReleased with little promotion, \"The Lost Tapes\" debuted at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling over 70,000 copies in its first week. It was met with widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed it as Nas' best record since his 1994 debut album \"Illmatic\". A second volume of previously unreleased songs was planned before Nas had signed with Def Jam Recordings in 2006, but the project was delayed because of issues with his record label; \"The Lost Tapes 2\" was eventually released on July 19, 2019.\n\nIn 2001, Nas made an artistic comeback with his fifth album \"Stillmatic\" and his highly publicized feud with rapper Jay-Z. Both revitalized his image in hip hop music at the time, following a string of commercially successful but critically subpar albums. Nas' record label, Columbia Records, capitalized on his comeback with a promotional campaign that included the release of two archival albums, the extended play \"\" and \"The Lost Tapes\", while leading up to the release of his 2002 studio album \"God's Son\".\n\n\"The Lost Tapes\" compiles previously unreleased tracks that Nas recorded during 1998 to 2001 in the sessions for both his 1999 album \"I Am...\" and \"Stillmatic\". Several songs from the sessions for the former album, including \"Blaze a 50\", \"Drunk by Myself\", and \"Poppa Was a Playa\", were bootlegged prior to its release and leaked to the Internet through MP3 technology, which led to their exclusion from \"I Am...\". Most of the compiled songs first became available as bootlegs on underground mixtapes before being selected and mastered for \"The Lost Tapes\".\n\nSongs on \"The Lost Tapes\" were recorded in several recording studios in New York, including Right Track Studios, The Hit Factory Studios, and Sony Studios in New York City, Lobo Studios in Long Island, and Music Palace in West Hempstead, as well as South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida and Westlake Studios in Santa Monica, California. Production was handled by The Alchemist, L.E.S., Poke and Tone, Precision, Rockwilder, Al West, Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie, and Hill, Inc. The album was packaged with a booklet featuring artwork by Chris \"C-Money\" Feldman and photography by Kareem Black, along with liner notes displaying the slogan \"No cameos. No hype. No bullsh*t\".\n\n\"The Lost Tapes\" features introspective lyrics and themes of urban life, sociology, and despair. Its music is characterized by low-key beats, sparse production, subtle string flourishes, mellow piano work, and subdued soul music loops. \"Stylus Magazine\"s Brett Berliner said songs such as \"Doo Rags\" and \"No Idea's Original\" incorporate classical melodies, while songs such as \"Purple\" and \"Fetus\" feature neo-classical themes. John Bush of AllMusic said the songs \"have more in common with his early recordings; there's more of a back-in-the-day, wasn't-it-all-so-simple-then sound to 'Doo Rags' and 'Poppa Was a Playa,' two tracks that definitely wouldn't have fit on the raging \"Stillmatic\".\" Music writer Craig Seymour observed \"spare beats\" in the music and few boasts in Nas' rapping, while Chris Conti from the \"Boston Phoenix\" said the simple beats \"counteract Nas's complex bars of braggadocio and street-life storytelling.\"\n\nAccording to Robert Christgau, \"The Lost Tapes\" abandons the thug persona of Nas' previous work in favor of more sensitive, nostalgic, and autobiographical lyrics. \"Slate\" magazine's David Samuels interpreted \"a message that begins with a rejection of the materialism of his ... rival Jay-Z\" and \"the home truth about how most kids in the projects feel about the real-life gangstas who live in their neighborhoods\", citing \"No Idea's Original\" as an example. \"New York Daily News\" writer Jim Farber commented on his lyrical observations, \"Nas focuses on linear scenarios and on human motivations ... \"unlike many hard rappers, Nas' tales of ghetto horror are not covert boasts but expressions of true fear\". Farber took note of \"a cinematic tale of self-destruction in 'Drunk by Myself,' and a compelling autobiography narrated from the womb in 'Fetus.' \"\n\nThe opening track \"Doo Rags\" contemplates Nas' youth and society's cyclical nature. It features a contemporary piano loop and jazz tones. Richard Hazell from \"HipHopDX\" describes the song as \"a piano propelled painting of time and space as seen through the third eye of Nas, which can easily be envisioned by any New York City dweller.\" On \"My Way\", he meditates over his rise out of poverty to the \"life of a rich thug\", recalls the death of his childhood friend Ill Will, and concedes that he \"still feels broke with millions in the bank.\" On \"U Gotta Love It\", Nas makes reference to the \"'86 crack blitz\" and discusses his own significance: \"This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment / Now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me / They ice-grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me.\" \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" advises to appreciate life's small epiphanies and be optimistic about the future. On \"No Idea's Original\", Nas notes the similarities of people in life and views other rappers as creatively derivative, while distinguishing himself from them: \"No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done / What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper / That means you inferior, not major.\" He references the line \"there's nothing new under the sun\" from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the song's chorus. \"No Idea's Original\" samples Barry White's 1973 song \"I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby\", a frequently sampled recording in hip hop music.\n\n\"Blaze a 50\" features a violin-based instrumental and a complex narrative that follows a tale of murder, sex, and betrayal. Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. \"Everybody's Crazy\" features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: \"Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use.\" In \"Purple\"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: \"The 'hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day / A bullet hit your heart and ambulance take you away / That ain't love it's hate / Think of all the mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?\" \"Drunk by Myself\" has lyrics concerning alcohol and self-medication.\n\n\"Black Zombie\" is an impassioned, self-reflective critique of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice (\"You believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes\"), economic insolvency (\"What do we own? The skin on our backs / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax\"), and dependency (\"I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie\"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and \"world view\" of Nas' subsequent albums. \"Poppa Was a Playa\" features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth. Gabriel Alvarez of \"Complex\" calls it an \"honest dedication to his old man: a jazz player, a rolling stone\" and writes of the song, \"The love is there despite the man's faults. Nas crafts a full picture of the past, looking at the infidelity and fights from both parents' perspectives.\"\n\nAn untitled hidden track follows \"Poppa Was a Playa\" and has Nas rapping from the perspective of his prenatal self. It was originally recorded for \"I Am...\" and had planned titles \"Fetus\" and \"Belly Button Window\". The track opens with solemn guitar chords and the sound of bubbling liquid before being overlaid with a beat and a piano riff. An introductory verse is delivered by Nas in a spoken word tone: \"Yeah. I want all my niggas to come journey with me / My name is Nas, and the year is 1973 / The beginning of me / Therefore I can see / Through my belly button window / Who I am.\" The narrative follows the time before his birth, covering subject matter such as his parents fighting and his expectations for life. In \"Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop\" (2009), writer Adam Bradley denotes the track's lyrical narrative of an MC's story of birth as \"one of the core narratives in rap\", having its roots in a similar autobiographical convention found in African-American slave narratives. Of Nas' narrative, Bradley states, \"By endowing the insensible with voice, he aspires to an expressive level that transcends speaking for oneself, or of oneself, to one that self-consciously constructs itself as an artist giving shape to that which lacks coherence.\"\n\n\"The Lost Tapes\" was released by Ill Will Records and Columbia Records, and distributed through Sony Music Entertainment. It was first released on September 23 in the United Kingdom, then September 24 in the United States, October 9 in Japan – where it was issued with three bonus tracks – and January 20, 2003, in Australia. The release received little marketing, with hip hop journalist Rob Markman noting no promotional music videos were produced and Nas' absence from the cover.\n\nOn October 2, 2002, \"The Lost Tapes\" was reported to have sold more than 70,000 copies in its first week of release, giving it a chart debut of number 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200. It ultimately spent eight weeks on the chart. It also charted at number three on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. By July 2008, the album had sold 340,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\n\"The Lost Tapes\" was met with widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 12 reviews.\n\nReviewing for \"Entertainment Weekly\" in September 2002, Craig Seymour said Nas' \"gritty, yet hopeful, reflections make \"Lost Tapes\" a real find.\" \"Rolling Stone\" critic Jon Caramanica hailed it as \"the real \"Stillmatic\"\", writing that it \"displays Nas' gifts for tightly stitched narrative and stunningly precise detail.\" In \"The A.V. Club\", Nathan Rabin deemed it a masterpiece whose assorted tracks cohere as well as any of Nas' official studio albums while reaffirming his reputation as \"rap music's poet laureate of urban despair\". Ken Capobianco from \"The Boston Globe\" said the leftover songs prove why Nas had so much promise early in his career, while \"Spin\"s Chris Ryan viewed the record as a hip hop version of Bob Dylan's much-bootlegged \"Basement Tapes\"—\"a raw document [that] still proves that Nas had \"it\" all along.\" \"PopMatters\" critic Marc L. Hill called it a \"masterfully arranged\" and \"necessary addition to the collection of any hip-hop fan\". In \"The Village Voice\", Christgau was particularly impressed by the four autobiographical songs closing the album, preferring them to other songs he felt are nothing more than outtakes. In a less enthusiastic review, Brett Berliner from \"Stylus Magazine\" wrote that as good as the songs were, \"they don't make a real album ... [more] like a superb mixtape\", while \"Billboard\"s Rashaun Hall believed the production on some of the songs sounds outdated.\n\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic editor John Bush recommended \"The Lost Tapes\" to \"hip-hop fans who want to hear some great rhyming with no added features\" and commented that tracks such as \"Doo Rags\", \"No Idea's Original\", and \"Black Zombie\" \"stand up to anything Nas has recorded since the original \"Illmatic\".\" Jesal Padania of RapReviews commented that the album \"proves remarkably consistent throughout, and is a superb listening experience\", and considered it a studio release, stating \"this is a short sharp shock of awesome lyricism, and many, unofficially, consider this to be the closest cousin we will ever get to \"Illmatic II\".\" \"Pitchfork Media\"s Ryan Dombal cited the album as one of Nas' \"finest moments\". About.com's Henry Adaso called it \"noteworthy because of its superiority to half the stuff in Nas' catalog.\" In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), Chris Ryan was less enthusiastic about the album, finding it \"somewhat inconsistent, and certainly too scattered to be considered an album per se,\" even though it features \"some classics, such as the nostalgic 'Doo Rags,' that are not to be missed.\" In its 2007 issue, \"XXL\" included \"The Lost Tapes\" in its list of \"classic\" albums to be given the publication's maximum \"XXL\" rating. In 2012, \"Complex\" included \"The Lost Tapes\" in their list of \"25 Rap Albums From the Past Decade That Deserve Classic Status\".\n\nA follow-up compilation, \"The Lost Tapes II\", was originally intended to be released on December 16, 2003, and include unreleased recordings, remixes, and freestyle tracks. However, its release was delayed, and in 2006, Nas signed to Def Jam Recordings. In a June 2010 interview for Hot 97.5 KVEG, he said of following-up \"The Lost Tapes\", \"I do got a lot of songs that really didn't make no album, that's just sittin' around [or] got lost. So I've got enough actually, for a \"Lost Tapes 2\" and \"3\" by now. So I've just got to set it up, put them together – 12 songs for one album, 12 songs for another album, and figure it out. That's all it takes.\" In September, he announced plans to release \"The Lost Tapes 2\" on December 14. However, its release was further delayed by Def Jam, whom Nas accused of mishandling the project and its budget in a personal e-mail sent to label executives. Reports of the project's delay incited fans to create an online petition in December asking for Def Jam to release the album. After losing time to the project's delay, Nas began recording for a new studio album and put plans for \"The Lost Tapes 2\" on hold. In a May 2011 interview for MTV News, he explained why the sequel was abandoned:\n\nOn June 11, 2019, Nas shared a promotional video via his Instagram account, announcing the release of \"The Lost Tapes 2\" in the near future. Its track listing and cover art were revealed on July 2, and the album was released on July 19.\n\nNotes\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867704", "title": "Soviet Nonconformist Art", "text": "Soviet Nonconformist Art\n\nThe term Soviet Nonconformist Art refers to Soviet art produced in the former Soviet Union from 1953 to 1986 (after the death of Joseph Stalin until the advent of Perestroika and Glasnost) outside of the rubric of Socialist Realism. Other terms used to refer to this phenomenon are \"underground art\" or \"unofficial art\".\n\nFrom the time of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 until 1932, the historical Russian avant-garde flourished and strove to appeal to the proletariat. However, in 1932 Stalin's government took control of the arts with the publication of \"On the Reconstruction of Literary-Artistic Organizations\"; a decree that put artists' unions under the control of the Communist Party. Two years later, Stalin instituted a policy that unified aesthetic and ideological objectives, which was called Socialist Realism, broadly defined as art that was, \"socialist in content and realist in form.\" Moreover, the new policy defined four categories of unacceptable art: political art, religious art, erotic art, and \"formalistic\" art, which included abstraction, expressionism, and conceptual art. Beginning in 1936, avant-garde artists who were unable or unwilling to adapt to the new policy were forced out of their positions, and often either murdered or sent to the gulag, as part of Stalin's Great Purges.\n\nIn the wake of World War II, referred to in Russia as The Great Patriotic War, Party resolutions were passed in 1946 and 1948, by Andrei Zhdanov, chief of the Propaganda Administration formally denouncing Western cultural influences at the start of the Cold War. Art students such as Ülo Sooster, an Estonian who later became important to the Moscow nonconformist movement, were sent to Siberian prison camps. The nonconformist artist Boris Sveshnikov also spent time in a Soviet labor camp. Oleg Tselkov was expelled from art school for 'formalism' in 1955, which from the viewpoint of the Party might have constituted an act of treason.\n\nThe death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and Nikita Khrushchev's subsequent denunciation of his rule during his Secret Speech at the Twentieth Party Congress in 1956 created a \"thaw\"; a liberal atmosphere wherein artists had more freedom to create nonsanctioned work without fearing repercussions. Furthermore, Stalin's cult of personality was recognized as detrimental, and within weeks many paintings and busts bearing his likeness were removed from public places. Artists such as Aleksandr Gerasimov, who had made their careers painting idealized portraits of Stalin, were forced out of their official positions, as they had become embarrassing to the new leadership.\n\nThe \"thaw\" era ended quickly, when in 1962, Khrushchev attended the public Manezh exhibition (an episode known as the Manege Affair) at which several nonconformist artists were exhibiting, including Ulo Sooster with his \"Eye in the Egg\". Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with Ernst Neizvestny, sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.\n\nThere were many artistic groups and movements that were active in the Soviet Union after the period of the thaw. They can be difficult to classify because often they were not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit.\n\nThe Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 was named after the small village Lianozovo outside Moscow, where most of the artists lived and worked. The members of this group were: Evgenii Kropivnitsky , the artist and poet, Olga Potapova , Oscar Rabin, Lidia Masterkova, Vladimir Nemukhin, Nikolai Vechtomov and the poets Vsevolod Nekrasov , Genrikh Sapgir, and Igor Kholin. This group was not related due to aesthetic concerns, but due to \"their shared search for a new sociocultural identity.\" critic and theorist Victor Tupitsyn considered that, \"the aestheticization of misery is precisely what distinguishes the representatives of the de-classed communal intelligentsia of the thaw era from their predecessors (the Socialist Realists), who created a paradisiac image of history.\"\n\nMany members of the Lianozovo group worked in an abstract style. The 1957 thaw resulted in the discovery of Western artistic practices and historical Russian avant-garde traditions by young Soviet artists. Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the Manezh exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, Victor Tupitsyn points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues. \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the Bulldozer Exhibition.\n\nA group of artists that had studios on and around Sretensky Boulevard, Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s. The members of this group were: Ilya Kabakov, Ülo Sooster, Eduard Steinberg, Erik Bulatov, Sergey Shablavin, Oleg Vassiliev, Viktor Pivovarov, Vladimir Yankilevsky, and sculptor Ernst Neizvestny. The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other.\n\nMany of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the Moscow Conceptualist school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"\n\nThis group includes Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Oleg Vassiliev, Sergey Shablavin, Komar and Melamid, Ivan Chuikov , Viktor Pivovarov, and also broadly encompasses the Sots artists and the Collective Actions group, which were both influential in the construction of Russian conceptualist art.\n\nMikhail Chemiakin's St. Petersburg Non-conformist Group developed out of a 1964 exhibition at the Hermitage Museum, where Chemiakin worked as a gallery assistant. The official name of the exhibition was \"Exhibition of the artist-workers of the economic part of the Hermitage: Towards the 200th anniversary of Hermitage\" and it included the work of Chemiakin, V. Kravchenko, V. Uflyand, V. Ovchinnikov and O. Liagatchev. Opening on March 30–31, it was closed by the authorities on April 1. The Hermitage director, Mikhail Artamonov, was removed from his post.\n\nIn 1967 the \"Petersburg Group Manifesto\" was written and signed by Chemiakin, O. Liagatchev, E. Yesaulenko and V. Ivanov. V. Ivanov and M. Chemiakin had previously developed the idea of Metaphysical Synthesism, which proposed creating a new form of icon painting through the study of religious art across the ages. \n\nA. Vasiliev and the miniature painter V. Makarenko joined the group later.\n\nFour years after the founding of the group, in 1971, Chemiakin emigrated to France, and later in 1981 to the United States. In 2007 he returned to France, where he resides now.\n\nLiagatchev, until his emigration to Paris in 1975, and Vasiliev continued to participate in exhibitions of non-conformist artists in Leningrad at the Gaza Palace of Culture (1974) and the Nevsky Palace of Culture (1975). Liagatchev's work in this period includes: \"Kafka\", \"Intimeniy XX\" (1973) and \"Composition - Canon\" (1975). The group finally became defunct in 1979, ceasing to have joint exhibitions.\n\nThe Gazanevsky Culture also known as Gazanevsky Exhibitions, or Gazanevschchina (), was an unofficial artistic movement of the mid-1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s, a new direction took place in an unofficial art movement in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). Many artists participated in nonconformist unofficial exhibitions which were held in the private apartments, so-called \"Apartment Exhibitions\".\n\nSome examples of the unofficial \"Apartment Exhibitions\" include:\n\nIn November 1975, the first Jewish exhibition \"Aleph\", also known as \"Twelve from the Soviet Underground\", took place in Eugene Abeshaus's apartment, where 12 Jewish artists participated: Eugene Abeshaus, Anatoly Basin (), Leonid Bolmat, Aleksandr Gurevich, Yuri Kalendarev, Tatyana Kornfeld, Aleksander Manusov, Aleksander Okun, Sima Ostrovsky, Alek Rapoport, Osip Sidlin, and Olga Schmuilovich. In 1976, the catalog of this exhibition was published in California, USA.\n\nIn 1976, the second \"Aleph\" exhibition took place in E. Abezgauz's apartment, with Eugene Abeshaus, A. Arefiev (), A. Basin (), Richard Vasmi (), Aleksandr Gurevich, Yuri Kalendarev and Tatiana Kerner.\n\nOsip Sidlin studied under Alexander Osmerkin, then Alexander Savinov, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, and was in contact with Kazimir Malevich.\n\nStarting in the middle of the 1930s, Osip Sidlin taught art in Leningrad at the Ilyich (Lenin) Palace of Culture, the First Five-Year Palace of Culture, and also at the Kapranov House of Culture. until his sudden death of heart attack in 1972.\n\nAmong Sidlin's students were Anatoly Basin, Galina Basina, Vladimir Egorov, Nina Fedotova, Anatoly Golovastov, Evgeny Goryunov, Igor V. Ivanov, Galina (Sizova) Ivanova, Boris Kupin, Alexander Mikhailovsky, Yury Nashivochnikov, Sergey Sivertsev, Natalia Toreeva, Margarita Trushina, Vasily Zhavoronkov, Vasily Yuzko and the poet Yuli Goldstein.\n\n\nTemple Wall School is a continuation of the \"\"School of Sidlin\"\" movement. After the death of Osip Sidlin, the teacher of the \"School of Sidlin\" art group, his student, Yury Nashivochnikov, brought the young artists together and in 1992 organized the art school, called the \"\"Temple Wall School\"\". Among his students were Vladimir Garde, Dmitry Markul, Svetlana Moskovskaya, Vladimir Ustinsky, Alexander Viziryako, and other artists. The \"Temple Wall School\" continues the tradition of the \"School of Sidlin\", mostly on study of the Byzantine and old Russian art, based on the two-dimensional wall fresco paintings and Russian icons. In 2015, the thesis the \"School of Sidlin and Temple Wall School\" was written by Svetlana Moskovskaya, Y. Nashivochnikov's student of the \"Temple Wall School\", and published in March, 2016 under the St. Petersburg State University, where she is discussing the continuation of the tradition of the artistic movement of 20th century to the 21st century, the next generation of the visual art movement.\n\n\nVladimir Sterligov was a student of Kazimir Malevich, and all his life followed K. Malevich's principles of cubism and suprematism in this artistic tradition. His followers were: Alexander Baturin, Elena Gritsenko, Alexander Nosov, Mikhail Tserush, Gennady Zubkov, and other artists, who expending the Sterligov's philosophy in their artistic view.\nTatiana Glebova, the wife of Sterligov, studied under Alexander Savinov and Pavel Filonov.\n\nPavel Kondratiev was also the student of Kazimir Malevich, Pavel Filonov, Alexander Savinov at the Academy of Arts/Vkhutein, and collaborated with V. Sterligov and T. Glebova at that time and later. So, they both have the same kind of \"Niche in art\", where their followers and pupils were in one group or another, but followed the same kind of principles in art. Pavel Kondratiev was also a follower of Pavel Filonov's \"Masters of Analytical Art\" (MAI) movement in Leningrad from 1927 to 1932.\n\nAlexander Arefiev () was a leader of the nonconformist group in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1977, and died in Paris in 1978.\n\nThe group included the artists: A. Arefiev (Arekh), Valentin Gromov () (b. 1930), Richard (Rikhard) Vasmi (), who is also known by his quote \"\"The artist painted his own Sarcophagus all his life\"\", Vladimir Shagin (), Sholom Schwartz (), Natalia Zhilina, who was close to this group, and the poet Roald Mandelstam (), who provided to the group the inspiration for their art work. Their group was called as \"\"The Order of Mendicant Painters\"\" or \"\"The Order of Unsold Painters\"\", and they were recognized only after the starting of the new Nonconformists movement in Leningrad and their participation in the exhibitions at the Gaza Palace of Culture (1974) and the Nevsky Palace of Culture (1975).\n\nThese artists participated individually in Soviet non-conformist art. They took an active part in the unofficial art, including participation in the \"apartment exhibitions\" and in the unofficial art exhibitions, such as the non-conformist Gaza-Nevsky exhibitions in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n\nTimur Novikov was one of the leaders of St. Petersburg art in the 1980s. In 1982 his theory of \"Zero Object\" acted as one of the foundations of Russian conceptual art. In 1988 he founded Neo-Academism.\n\nJavad Mirjavadov, Azerbaijani artist, a non-conformist and a reformer, whose work had an influence on the development of contemporary Azerbaijani art. A turning point in his creative work came when he was a student and saw a reproduction of Paul Cézanne's \"Mardi Gras\", experiencing creative regeneration.\n\nUkrainian underground developed in the part of soviet period of Ukraine, from the late 1950s until the 1980-90s. This term was used for the culture which was banned by the state in totalitarian countries of Eastern Europe and USSR. It was known under other names, such as Unofficial art, Nonconformism , Dissident art in literature, music and visual art. Was arosed spontaneously in all Ukrainian large cities as Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Uzhhorod, Lviv.\n\nIt ended thanks to perestroika, that lead to Ukrainian independence in 1991.\n\nCollectors of Soviet and Russian Nonconformist art include:\n\n\n\n"}

Towards the end of his first WWF run, Funk reverted to his 2 Cold Scorpio name, later shortening it to \"Scorpio\", and began teaming with former WCW teammate and friend Ron Simmons, as well as Terry Funk through most of 1998. He soon after became a member of Al Snow's J.O.B. Squad. In mid-1998, he competed in the WWF's Brawl for All tournament, replacing Ken Shamrock. He lost in the quarterfinals to The Godfather. In early 1999, 2 Cold Scorpio requested time off due to personal problems, but was instead released from the WWF.\n\n2 Cold Scorpio next made sporadic appearances for ECW, which included a challenge against then-champion Mike Awesome for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the December 10, 1999, edition of \"ECW on TNN\". 2 Cold Scorpio competed for All Japan Pro Wrestling until native members of its roster defected to form Pro Wrestling Noah in 2000, and both Scorpio and Vader followed. During his tenure in Noah, he won the GHC Openweight Hardcore Championship, as well as the GHC Tag Team Championship with both Vader and Doug Williams.\n\nIn 2006, 2 Cold Scorpio signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. Upon joining the promotion, he returned to using his Flash Funk character in the WWE developmental promotion Deep South Wrestling until he was released on May 11, 2007, without ever appearing on WWE television.

Anderson. On April 28, 2012, 2 Cold Scorpio wrestled Shane Douglas in the main event of Extreme Reunion (a wrestling event promoted by Douglas) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the match, two masked men got involved. One was Kevin Sullivan, who attacked Douglas. The other was former ECW owner Tod Gordon, who hugged 2 Cold Scorpio. Douglas pinned 2 Cold Scorpio with a twisting sunset flip.\n\n2 Cold Scorpio made his debut for Chikara in September 2012, when he, Jerry Lynn and Tommy Dreamer entered the 2012 King of Trios as \"The Extreme Trio\", defeating Team WWF (1-2-3 Kid, Aldo Montoya and Tatanka) in their first round match. The following day, The Extreme Trio was eliminated from the tournament by Team ROH (Mike Bennett, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson).\n\nOn February 2, 2013, 2 Cold Scorpio defeated ACH in the main event of the first ever National Pro Wrestling Day to become the 2013 Rey De Voladores.

Within the Rocky Mountain Pro promotion, he also has a large role in producing the live television product they air on Right Now TV, Fight Network UK and Twitch.tv. 2 Cold Scorpio is also the current Rocky Mountain Pro tag team champion alongside tag team partner Airborne Alex Anthony after winning the championship at their Milestone 9 Pay Per View on June 30, 2019.\n\nDuring a Ring of Honor's \"Straight Shootin\" interview in 2004, Scaggs admitted to hard drug use while he was in ECW and WWF, but it had been significantly accelerated during his stint in WWF due to the fact that he was simply making more money and thus had the opportunity to use more. Scaggs regretted his covert lifestyle at the time, and wondered that if he had admitted to WWF and himself that he had a problem, his career might have lasted longer in WWF. He also admitted to have kicked his hard drug use several years ago, although still actively using marijuana.\n\nScorpio is an avid supporter of the Trump administration. \n\n\n"}

The division employs about 4,700 people, including approximately 2,630 teachers and teacher assistants.\n\nLike all public K–12 school systems in Virginia, NNPS is legally classified as a school division. While Virginia school divisions operate in largely the same manner as school districts in the rest of the United States, they have one key difference from their counterparts in other states—they have no taxing authority. NNPS, like all other school divisions in the state, must rely on its associated local government for the bulk of its funding.\nNNPS is run by an eight-member School Board of elected officials. Seven of the eight are elected in a ward voting system, while the eighth is selected at-large from the entire city. The policies of the School Board are implemented by a superintendent. \n\nThe schools of NNPS are divided into the three standard levels of American primary and secondary education. , the Newport News Public Schools division educates approximately 29,400 children in 5 early childhood centers, 24 elementary schools, 7 middle schools, 5 high schools, 1 middle/high combination school, and 9 program sites.\n\n\n\n\nNewport News Public Schools offers elementary, middle and high school students the chance to focus in such areas as environmental science, communication and performing arts, aviation, global studies, and math, science, technology and engineering through a variety of magnet and specialty program options. These include:\n\nThe Aviation Academy, located at the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, teaches high school students with an emphasis on engineering, particularly in the field of aviation. The academy also offers students a Pilot Ground School course.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate Diploma Program teaches students with an emphasis on international learning. Students at Warwick High School can apply to enter a two-year IB program. They must have completed algebra, a year of a foreign language, and an advanced integrated language-arts class, all with grades of at least B; recommendations from teachers; and at least a 3.0 grade point average. The programs are offered in conjunction with the International Baccalaureate.\n\nA complete listing of magnet programs in the Newport News Public Schools division can be found on the NNPS Magnet Program Directory\n\nNNPS offers a Tecommunications course, other-known as Telecom, for high school juniors and seniors. These courses teach the basis of television production, and allow students to experience it first-hand at the division's local cable station. This also allows employment opportunities for students to record various events for the school system. These courses are dual-enrolled with Norfolk State University.\n\nNNPS offers several programs that differ from a traditional educational curriculum. These include: \n\nThe Point Option program offers a unique opportunity for students to experience teaching and learning in a non-traditional way.

He is best known for his appearances with ECW from 1995 to 2000 and WWE from 1998 to 2005. His ring name is a reference to the Blue Meanies, the antagonists from the 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\".\n\nHeffron started wrestling in the Midwest out of Al Snow's Bodyslammers Pro Wrestling Gym in Lima, Ohio in March 1994. He continued to wrestle in various independent wrestling promotions throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions until 1996.\n\nHeffron was noticed by Raven and Stevie Richards at a Steel City Wrestling show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was asked by Raven to become Richards' sidekick in ECW. He went on to become The Blue Meanie, taking his name and persona from the villains of the 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", in 1995 in ECW at the November To Remember event. He was the flunky for Richards, who was the flunky for Raven. Heffron, Richards, and Nova performed several skits but their most famous was the bWo, a parody of WCW's top heel group, the nWo. Meanie played the role of Da Blue Guy in the bWo, lampooning nWo member Scott Hall's nickname \"The Bad Guy\".\n\nUnder the name Blue Boy, Heffron returned to ECW in 2000. During this period, Heffron had lost over 100 pounds of weight. His gimmick was that of an arrogant stud who would insult the looks and weight of fans and other wrestlers, in an ironic twist.\n\nHeffron made his WWE debut on the November 29, 1998 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\", interfering in a match between Duane Gill and Christian. He then spent some time as part of Al Snow's J.O.B. Squad. He rose to short prominence as Bluedust, a revival of a 1996 mockery of the Goldust gimmick he used in ECW, this time paired with Goldust himself. Bluedust and Goldust were pitted against one another at WWE's pay-per-view, a match Goldust eventually won. Heffron would later be pulled under Goldust's \"spell\", calling him \"mommy\" and serving as a manager, all the while bickering with Goldust's other manager, Ryan Shamrock. After Goldust dumped both Meanie and Shamrock, Heffron made little headway in the WWE. He challenged Jeff Jarrett for the Intercontinental Championship on the July 17th 1999 episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, but lost. He left WWE in late 1999.\n\nThe Blue Meanie appeared at WWE's ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 12, 2005. He made headlines at the event for being bloodied and deliberately (and legitimately) injured by WWE wrestler JBL. A few weeks after the incident, during which time Heffron indicated on his website that he was considering pursuing legal action against JBL, it was announced that he had signed a short-term deal with WWE and reformed the bWo with Stevie Richards and Simon Dean (formerly Nova). On the July 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", the bWo drove to ringside in JBL's limousine, then proceeded to spraypaint \"bWo\" on the hood. This led to a No Disqualification match between JBL and Meanie later that evening, which Meanie won after interference from Richards, who hit a stiff chair shot to JBL's head. and World Heavyweight Champion Batista. The Mexicools later defeated Meanie, Richards, and Nova in a six-man tag match at The Great American Bash.\n\nIn 2005, Heffron wrestled at Hardcore Homecoming against Tracy Smothers in what commentator Joey Styles called a \"comedy match\", and also appeared with Raven during Raven's match against Sandman. In April 2006, Heffron announced on his blog that he had been diagnosed with empyema, and had undergone emergency surgery to have part of his lung removed. On June 3, 2007, he defeated Smothers to become the World Champion again, but lost it at the next event on August 5, to Jason Bane in a Street Fight. On September 8, he defeated Troy Justice to become APWF Heavyweight Champion. On December 28, he was managed by Tammy Lynn Sytch and teamed with The Patriot to defeat The Sychadellic Sissies (Ace Darling and Nicky Oceans) at National Wrestling Superstars Holiday Tour.\nOn January 18, 2008, he defeated Danny Demanto at a National Wrestling Superstars event in Manville, New Jersey. On April 12, he and JD Love defeated Zaquary Springate III and Isys Ephex in a surprise appearance at 2CW's Living on the Edge. On August 8, 2010, Heffron was slated to appear at the TNA PPV Hardcore Justice; however, he could not attend the event and was replaced by a fake Blue Meanie named The Blue Tilly.\n\nOn September 4, 2015, Da Blue Guy, Big Stevie Cool and Hollywood Nova reunited as the Blue World Order for Chikara's 2015 King of Trios tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament in their first round match by the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster).\n\nHeffron, under his Blue Meanie name, currently wrestles and is a trainer at Monster Factory.\n\nIn March, 2020, Heffron began a podcast called \"Mind of the Meanie\" with co-host Josh Shernoff.\n\nHeffron has appeared in the WB sitcom \"Nikki\", the documentary film \"Beyond the Mat\", the film \"Communication Breakdown\", and the cult horror film \"Swamp Zombies\" (with Dan Severn). He also starred in the films \"Curse of the Wolf\", \"Fist of the Vampire\", and \"Warriors of the Apocalypse\". He had a small cameo in the film \"The Wrestler\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867762", "title": "Wendi Richter", "text": "Wendi Richter\n\nWendi Richter (born September 6, 1961) is a retired American professional wrestler. She began her professional wrestling career in companies such as the National Wrestling Alliance, where she teamed with Joyce Grable, with whom she held the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice. In the 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). She held the WWF Women's Championship twice and feuded with The Fabulous Moolah over the title. She was also involved in a storyline with singer Cyndi Lauper called the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\". Richter, however, left the WWF after losing the championship in controversial fashion. She then worked in the World Wrestling Council and American Wrestling Association, where she held both companies' women's titles. \n\nWendi Richter was trained at The Fabulous Moolah's \"Lillian Ellison School of Professional Wrestling\" by Leilani Kai, Judy Martin and Joyce Grable and made her professional debut in 1979. In early 1982, Richter tag teamed with Moolah against Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria for three matches for the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Richter was later paired with Joyce Grable, with whom she also trained for six weeks, to form a tag team called The Texas Cowgirls. In late 1982, they wrestled in a series of matches in Canada's Stampede Wrestling against Velvet McIntyre and Judy Martin. She continued her feud with McIntyre in Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling Association, where she was defeated twice. While in Mid-South Wrestling Association she was a friend of Jim Cornette who made her an honorary member of the Midnight Express. Richter and Grable continued their rivalry with McIntyre and Martin into April 1983 in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. In May, the team reformed in Stampede Wrestling in matches against McIntyre and Penny Mitchell. The team also won the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice.\n\nRichter returned stateside signing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1983. In April 1984, Richter teamed with Peggy Lee for a series of matches with old rivals Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. WWF owner Vince McMahon brought in Cyndi Lauper for a feud with Lou Albano (who had appeared as Lauper's dad in her \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" music video). Albano seconded WWF Women's Champion Fabulous Moolah, while Lauper was in the corner of Wendi Richter. Richter defeated Moolah at MTV's \"The Brawl to End It All\" for the Women's Championship on July 23, 1984, with Richter lifting her own shoulder off the canvas during a double-pinfall situation while Moolah's shoulders remained down. With the win, she ended what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign as recognized by the WWF; in reality she had lost the title several times between 1956 and 1978, and Richter's win had in reality only ended a nearly seven-year reign by Moolah as champion). The broadcast of the women's match earned MTV its largest ratings in history up to that point. This match was also the beginning of the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling. Richter faced Moolah's protégé, Leilani Kai, who defeated Richter for the title, in early 1985 at \"The War to Settle the Score\". She regained the title at the first WrestleMania one month later. While wrestling for the WWF, Richter referred to herself as \"150 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal\". Richter was also animated for a CBS Saturday morning cartoon, \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\". In addition, she appeared in Lauper's music video for \"She Bop\".\n\nIn 1985, after losing and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was scheduled to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as The Spider. During the match, The Spider broke from the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's shoulders to the mat. The referee—who was in on the plan—delivered a swift three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack The Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise. Interviewed for \"The Fabulous Moolah\" episode of the 2019 documentary series \"Dark Side of the Ring\", Richter claimed she had no idea that Moolah was The Spider that evening until she unmasked her.\n\nIt was reported that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when she arrived at the arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.\n\nUpon leaving the WWF, Richter wrestled in Puerto Rico, Japan, and throughout the United States in independent promotions. In Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council, she traded the WWC Women's Championship with Monster Ripper, holding the belt twice: once in May 1987 and once in July 1987.\n\nRichter surfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1987 to challenge champion Madusa Miceli for the AWA Women's Championship, winning the title in December 1988. On December 13, 1988, she participated in a mixed tag team match at SuperClash III with partners The Top Guns (Ricky Rice and Derrick Dukes) against Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka) and Madusa Miceli. Richter's team won the match when she pinned Miceli.\n\nOn January 29, 2005, Richter appeared at WrestleReunion in an eight-woman tag team match (teaming with Bambi, Malia Hosaka, and Jenny Taylor wrestling against Sherri Martel, Peggy Lee Leather, Krissy Vaine, and Amber O'Neal. In August of that same year, Richter appeared at the second WrestleReunion event, WrestleReunion 2, in a six-person tag team match.\n\nIn the years after her retirement, Richter was uninvolved with wrestling. In a 2005 shoot interview, she expressed disgust towards the portrayal of women in the WWE product, and was still hurt over her WWF exit. In 2010, Richter was offered induction in the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2010, which she accepted. She was inducted by Roddy Piper. In contrast of her shoot interviews, her speech spoke fondly of her wrestling career and how the WWE Divas thanked her for her influence. Richter's speech ended joyfully, exclaiming \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!\"\n\nOn the June 16, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Richter appeared in a in-ring segment along with Cyndi Lauper, Roddy Piper and then-Diva's Champion Layla as part of the \"1000th episode\" buildup. Piper expressed his gratitude to Richter and Lauper for their \"Rock 'N Wrestling\" angle and presented Lauper with a gold record, with which she eventually hit Heath Slater, who at the time had a gimmick of insulting veteran Superstars before getting his comeuppance.\n\nRichter grew up in Dallas, Texas, and before she entered the sport of professional wrestling, she worked on her family's ranch and took part in rodeo competitions. She attended Bossier High School, where she participated in volleyball, track, and cross-country. She later majored in computer programming at Dallas's Draughon's Business College. In the 1980s, she moved to Crystal River, Florida.\n\nAfter leaving the wrestling business, Richter worked as a real estate agent. She also returned to school for 13 years, earning a degree in physical therapy and a master's degree in occupational therapy. Aside from therapy, Richter competes in dog shows, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. She was once married to Hugo Savinovich, an announcer for the WWF. In 2019 she was featured in the documentary \"Circle of Champions: The History of Women's Pro Wrestling\" directed by Christopher Annino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The W116 automobiles were the first Mercedes-Benz models to be officially called S-Class, although earlier sedan models had already unofficially been designated with the letter 'S' – for \"Sonderklasse\" or \"special class.\"\n\nThe 'new' S-class generation development began in 1966, which was only a year after the launch of the W108/09. This was the first Mercedes saloon to feature the brand new corporate styling theme which was to be continued until 1993 when the 190 was discontinued. The design, finalized in December 1969 was a dramatic leap forward, with more masculine lines that combined to create an elegant and sporty character. The basic design concept carried through the themes originally introduced on the R107 SL-Class roadster, especially the front and rear lights. As for the SL, the W116 received the ridged lamp covers which kept dirt accumulation at bay; this was to remain a Mercedes-Benz design theme into the 21st century. The W116 was Friedrich Geiger's last design for Mercedes-Benz; his career had started with the Mercedes-Benz 500K in 1933.\n\nThe car was presented in September 1972. The model range initially included two versions of the M110 engine (Straight-six with 2746 cc displacement)—the 280 S (using a Solex carburetor) and the 280 SE (using Bosch D-Jetronic injection), plus the 350 SE, powered by the M116 engine (V8 with 3499 cc displacement). After the 1973 Fuel Crisis, a long-wheelbase version of the 280 was added to the lineup.\n\nHalf a year later, in early 1973, two new models powered by the M117 engine (V8 with 4520 cc displacement) were added to the range—the 450 SE and the 450 SEL (with a 100 mm longer body). The 450 had in most markets, federalized cars offered while Swedish market cars had an EGR-valve and until 1976. The 450s received a plusher interior as well, with velour or leather seats rather than the checkered cloth of the lesser models. The door insides were also of a different design, being pulled up around the windows.\n\nThe most notable W116 was the high-performance, limited-production 450 SEL 6.9, which was introduced in 1975. This model boasted by far the largest engine installed in a post-war Mercedes-Benz (and any non-American production automobile) up to that time, and also featured self-leveling hydropneumatic suspension.\n\nThe 300 SD sedan (American market only) had a turbocharged 3.0-litre inline-five diesel engine developed from the C111 experimental vehicle. \n\nThe 450 SE was named the European Car of the Year in 1974, even though the W116 range was first introduced at the Paris Motor Show in the fall of 1972. The W116 range became the first production car to use an electronic four-wheel multi-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) from Bosch as an option from 1978 on.\n\nProduction totaled 473,035 units. The W116 was succeeded by the W126 S-Class in 1979. The W116 was sold throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.\n\nIn 1975, the W116 was upgraded with a new fuel injection system to comply with revised exhaust emission standards in European markets. A slight power reduction was a result of this update. In 1978, a series of engine upgrades restored original performance levels with new fuel injection systems. Initially the early models (1973-1974) of the W116 with the Twin Cam inline 6 used the D-Jetronic fuels injection system with computers and MAP sensor that are both prone to failure after more than 20 years of use. From 1975 onward they used the K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system, a less complicated system that proved to be much more reliable in the long run and injectors cost 6x less than the D-jetronic system. The W116 equipped with the K-Jetronic system, used a cast-iron fuel distributor, which can be prone to rust over time if moisture or water is present in the fuel. This was changed to an alloy fuel distributor in the following model W126 and is not subject to corrosion.\n\nThe high-performance 450 SEL 6.9 version of the S-Class was built on its own assembly line by Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany and based on the long-wheelbase version of the W116 chassis. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the \"6.9\", to separate it from the regular 450 SEL.\n\nThe 6.9 was first shown to the motoring press at the Geneva Auto Show in 1974, and produced between 1975 and 1981 in extremely limited numbers. It was billed as the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz car line, and the successor to Mercedes-Benz's original high-performance sedan, the 300 SEL 6.3. The 6.9's successor—the top of range 500 SEL—continued the 6.9's remarkable self-leveling hydropneumatic suspension as an extra-cost option.\n\nThe 6.9 was the first Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension system introduced by Citroën in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed air suspensions. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or \"accumulators\" in lieu of conventional shock absorbers and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citroën's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citroën system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven in the event of a hydraulic failure. The special hydraulic fluid required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, ride height could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50 mm) for increased ground clearance.\n\nThe suspension system gave the car the benefits of a both a smooth ride and handling that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist David E. Davis, to be \"tossed about like a Mini.\" The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed automatic transmission unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF limited slip differential both for enhanced roadholding performance on dry pavement and enhanced traction in inclement weather.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes and four-wheel independent suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The M100 engine is a cast iron V8 with single overhead camshafts which was a bigger version of the engine also used in the Mercedes-Benz 600 and the Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3. Notable is the Bosch K-Jetronic electromechanical fuel injection, forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a \"dry sump\" engine lubrication system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached to the inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9 l (6,834 cc or 417 in³) power plant was rated at and 405 lb·ft (549 N·m) of torque, helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.\n\nTop speed was factory-rated at 140 mph (225 km/h), but some journalists testing the car saw speeds approaching 150 mph (241 km/h). Among those journalists was Brock Yates. Yates was approached by the factory to write promotional literature about the 6.9 for advertising purposes. He agreed under the condition that he could list the car's faults as well as its positives and create an unbiased review. Daimler-Benz agreed and Yates was given an American-market spec 6.9 to drive from Manhattan to the Road Atlanta grand prix race track in Georgia. There, Yates would drive the car in as-arrived condition at racing speeds for a full 40 laps or just over 100 miles (160 km). His complaint on this long drive on public roads was that the magnetic CB antenna blew off at 130 miles per hour. The only change made to the car upon its arrival at Road Atlanta was an adjustment of tire pressure. Driving 40 laps was a difficult task for the street-legal full size luxury sedan primarily designed and geared for comfortable Autobahn cruising. The 6.9 suffered no major mechanical problems and averaged a respectable 72 mph (116 km/h) throughout the test, completing it with little more than excess dust on the bodywork from the Michelin radial street tires on which the car was driven to Atlanta. Yates was so comfortable driving the 6.9 around the track that he reported having run at least one lap with the sunroof open and the radio on, but the high price of the car made him think better of such risky driving and he finished the test with the radio off and both hands on the wheel.\n\nAll of this technology came at a very high price. At a time when the most expensive Cadillacs, the mid-sized Seville and full-sized Cadillac Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five limousine each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most Rolls-Royces. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled walnut veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated zebrano veneer. US models also had different bumper rubbers fitted to the more protruding \"park bench\" impact absorbing bumpers. \n\nThe 6.9 lacked expected luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, although a unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight wipers and washers and/or headlights with a special vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for Chrysler Corporation for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of General Motors.\n\nFar more modern than the contemporary Cadillac, which still had a live rear axle, and both faster and larger inside than the either the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac, the 6.9 was indistinguishable from its W116 stablemates save for a modest \"6.9\" badge on the decklid and wider tires. As discreet as the badge was, it could be deleted/ordered with option 261 \"omission of the displacement figure on the trunk lid\" at extra cost for those who wanted to avoid attention either from drivers of other high-performance cars or from law enforcement. In the words of David E. Davis, the 6.9 was \"a $50,000 exercise in going fast.\" \n\nFor fans of the discontinued 6.3 or for those that wanted a car that \"Car and Driver\" proclaimed to be \"the greatest Mercedes-Benz ever built,\" the price was inconsequential. At its launch in 1975, the 450 SEL 6.9 cost DM 69,930. In the last year of production, and by 1979, the price had risen DM 81,247. Regardless of the price Mercedes-Benz marketing strategies strategists resulted in a total production of 7,380 units by 1980, and most of these were exported to the USA. This volume is quite respectable considering the overall sales trend of powerful luxury cars following the 1973 energy crisis.\n\nIn a poll conducted by Britain's \"Classic & Sports Car\" magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth on their list of the \"world's greatest saloons.\" The May 2004 edition of another British publication, \"Mercedes Enthusiast\" magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used Car Guide lists a top value of US$40,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example can be had for considerably less. As is often the case with older cars that contain exotic engineering and parts unique to that one model, however, running and maintenance costs for a 6.9 can quickly overshadow a low initial purchase price.\n\nIn September 2013, a 1979 W116 300 SD was campaigned in the 24 Hours of LeMons at Carolina Motorsports Park, where it completed 166 laps at an average speed of 54.8 MPH. It won the highest prize of the event, the Index of Effluency. Other than mild issues relating to brake and tire wear, no mechanical issues were encountered. After numerous modifications to handling, the car was again run in February 2014 at Barber Motorsports park in Birmingham, AL. It placed 44th, but turned 281 laps at an average pace of 59.6 MPH. One of the key advantages of the 300 SD in long distance racing is its exceptional fuel economy on track, where it burns just 2.5 GPH (Roughly 18MPG). In July 2014 it placed first in class at Sebring. It is still active in the series.\n\nTechnical data Mercedes-Benz W116 (Manufacturer's figures except where stated)\n\n<div class=\"NavContent\">\n\nThe W116 S-Class incorporated a broad variety of Mercedes-Benz safety innovations.\n\n\n"}

Howard Kaloogian, Melanie Morgan and Sal Russo established the organization in 2004. The organization supports front-line United States Armed Forces troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSal Russo, Melanie Morgan and Howard Kaloogian formed Move America Forward in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, the organization took its first trip to Iraq called \"Voices of Soldiers\" tour. Soldiers were interviewed to share their stories in the success in the fight against terrorism during the trip. That August, Move America Forward sponsored a \"You don't speak for me, Cindy!\" tour to counter Cindy Sheehan's protest at President Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch and the vigils held in her support. The following year, Move America Forward sponsored \"Trip Gold Star\", the organization’s second trip to Iraq. The trip to Kurdistan, including Gold Star Moms, was for the parents of fallen American soldiers to see where their sons and daughters made the ultimate sacrifice. That year, the organization introduced its \"Care package for the troops\" program. The program sends care packages including coffee, cookies, beef jerky, Gatorade, and other requested items to troops year around.\n\nMove America Forward held its first \"Honoring our Heroes at the Holidays\" national bus tour in 2007. The tour traveled to over 40 cities in the United States and collected over 200,000 Christmas, Hanukkah and holiday cards for American troops. That year, a third trip to Iraq was led by spokeswoman Debbie Lee. The Move America Forward delegation visited troops in Ramadi, at Camp Marc Lee named after Debbie Lee's son, the first Navy SEAL to be killed in the war in Iraq. In 2008, Move America Forward sent a delegation to Guantanamo Bay to thank troops for their service. The trip was organized by Kylie Williams, the official ambassador for veterans' advocacy for the State of Florida. The second \"Honoring our Heroes at the Holidays\" national bus tour collected over 200,000 cards that year. That year, Move America Forward hosted the first Troopathon, an online fundraiser, to raise money to send care packages to troops.\n\n\"K9 Care Packages\", a program to support military working dogs and their handlers, was launched by the organization in October 2011. Move America Forward was named \"Top-rated Nonprofit\" by Great Nonprofits in 2014 and 2015. That March, the Rogers Family Company donated coffee and tea to Move America Forward for troops. Stag Arms partnered with the organization for the 2014 Troopathon in July.\n\nIn March 2015, Danny Gonzalez, Move America Forward's Director of Communications shared with Sputnik that the US Transportation Security Administration's security screening methods have been defective since inception and that proposed reevaluation of screening procedures will have no effect. In June 2015, Move America Forward hosted its 8th annual Troopathon fundraiser to help send care packages to American troops deployed in war zones overseas. The organization raised over $280,000. State Assemblyman Devon Mathis, Hulk Hogan, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Geraldo Rivera, Brian Kilmeade, Dennis Miller, Adam Corolla, Herman Cain, Ted Nugent, Jerry Bruckheimer, Joe Theismann, Tony Orlando, and Nancy Grace made appearances on the broadcast that year. Prior to the 2015 Chattanooga shootings on July 16, 2015, Move America Forward advocated for more security at military recruiting centers. After the shooting, the organization released a statement in support of lawmakers that wants to allow military recruiters to carry firearms.\n\nIn 2016, Move America Forward partnered with the Wounded Warrior Project to send care packages to troops overseas to show support for those away from their families during the holiday season.\n\nMove America Forward received a 2 out of 4 star rating from Charity Navigator. Guidestar rated the organization as a Platinum Participant.\n\nThe organization annually hosts \"Troopathon,\" an 8-hour live online broadcast that it says it uses to help send packages to American troops. The fundraiser hosts movie stars, TV personalities, elected officials, professional athletes, musicians, talk radio hosts and many other supporters. \n\nIn a partnership with the Jelly Belly Company, Move America Forward introduced a program where soldiers would receive specially wrapped 2 oz. bags of jelly bellies to use as gift to the native people they were in contact on a daily basis with. Each specially marked package displays these words in English, Arabic, and Pashto language: \"A gift from the America People in hope that your country will one day enjoy the freedom and opportunities that we have in the United States.\"\n\nIn 2014, ProPublica released a report accusing Move America Forward of giving a percentage of its donations to for-profit companies run by people affiliated with Tea Party Express. Move America Forward responded to each allegation in the piece and dismissed them as false.\n"}

This demand can be met by unvarying power plants, dispatchable generation, or by a collection of smaller intermittent energy sources, depending on which approach has the best mix of low cost, availability and high reliability in any particular market. The remainder of demand, varying throughout a day, is met by dispatchable generation which can be turned up or down quickly, such as load following power plants, peaking power plants, or energy storage.\n\nPower plants that do not change their power output quickly, such as large coal or nuclear plants, are generally called baseload power plants.\n\nGrid operators take long and short term bids to provide electricity over various time periods and balance supply and demand continuously. The detailed adjustments are known as the unit commitment problem in electrical power production.\n\nWhile historically large power grids used unvarying power plants to meet the base load, there is no specific technical requirement for this to be so. The base load can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of intermittent power sources and dispatchable generation.\n\nUnvarying power plants can be coal, nuclear, combined cycle plants, which may take several days to start up and shut down, hydroelectric, geothermal, biogas, biomass, solar thermal with storage and ocean thermal energy conversion. \n\nThe desirable attribute of dispatchability applies to some gas plants, wind (through blade pitch) and hydroelectricity. Grid operators also use \"curtailment\" to shut plants out of the grid when their energy is not needed.\n\nThere are 195 gigawatts of grid storage installed world-wide; 94% is pumped-storage hydroelectricity; 2% is in batteries. \nPumped storage uses cheap power at times of low demand, usually night, to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, then lets it drop back through turbines during peak demand times, usually in the day. Availability of solar power in peak hours of the day can reduce the need for storage. The biggest storage facility in the world is on the Virginia-West Virginia border, with 50% more capacity than the Hoover Dam.\n\nGrid operators solicit bids to find the cheapest sources of electricity over short and long term buying periods.\n\nNuclear and coal plants have very high fixed costs, high plant load factor but very low marginal costs, though not as low as solar, wind, and hydroelectric. On the other hand, peak load generators, such as natural gas, have low fixed costs, low plant load factor and high marginal costs.\n\nCoal and nuclear power plants do not change production to match power consumption demands since it is more economical to operate them at constant production levels, and not all power plants are designed for it. However, some nuclear power stations, such as those in France, are physically capable of being used as load following power plants and do alter their output, to some degree, to help meet varying demands. \n\nSome combined-cycle plants usually fuelled by gas, can provide baseload power, as well as being able to be cost-effectively cycled up and down to match more rapid fluctuations in consumption. \n\nDifferent plants and technologies may have differing capacities to increase or decrease output on demand: nuclear plants are generally run at close to maximum output continuously (apart from maintenance, refueling and periodic refurbishment), while coal-fired plants may be cycled over the course of a day to meet demand. Plants with multiple generating units may be used as a group to improve the \"fit\" with demand, by turning units on and off.\n\nAccording to National Grid plc chief executive officer Steve Holliday in 2015, baseload is \"outdated\", as microgrids would become the primary means of production, and large powerplants relegated to supply the remainder.\n\n\n"}

(Angela would later play violin on certain Bush songs, as well as on one of Cyndi Lauper's albums.)\n\nPulsford attended Fairfax High School (Sutton Coldfield) the University of Bradford in Bradford, West Yorkshire before dropping out with the intent of playing in a rock band.\n\nIn 1992, Pulsford met Gavin Rossdale in a London club and they discovered a mutual appreciation for several musical groups and artists. They formed a band called Future Primitive and were joined by bassist Dave Parsons and drummer Robin Goodridge and managed by Joe Oliver. Shortly thereafter the band was renamed Bush after Shepherd's Bush, London. Pulsford was the band's lead guitarist.\n\nBush released their debut album, \"Sixteen Stone\", in 1994. The album went six times platinum, riding the strength of the grunge movement and such hit singles as \"Comedown,\" \"Glycerine,\" \"Machinehead,\" \"Little Things,\" and \"Everything Zen.\" They achieved further success with three more albums and hit singles such as \"Swallowed,\" \"Greedy Fly,\" \"The Chemicals Between Us,\" \"Letting the Cables Sleep,\" and \"The People That We Love.\"\n\nPulsford released a solo album in 1999 entitled \"Heavenly Toast on the Paradise Road\". All material on the album was written by Pulsford.\n\nIn 2002, after the release of the album \"Golden State\", Pulsford took a break from touring with the band while his wife was pregnant. He was replaced by Chris Traynor temporarily and his future in the band became the subject of much speculation among fans. Rossdale later confirmed that he intended to make the next Bush album with Traynor and said that Pulsford had quit the band.\n\nDespite Rossdale affirming that he wanted to continue Bush with Traynor, the band went on an indefinite hiatus following the end of the \"Golden State\" tour. Rossdale later formed Institute with Traynor. Backtracking on his previous assertion that Bush could continue without Pulsford, Rossdale stated that he started a new band because he didn’t want to dilute everything Bush had accomplished by changing members.\n\nSince the breakup of Bush, Pulsford has spent time with his family. However, he has remained musically active recording in his home studio and producing other artists' work. In 2008 he was working with British alternative rock group Furlined as a producer and occasional guitarist. Pulsford also worked with singer Emma Holland on her second album, and in 2012 produced the debut album by London singer/songwriter Dave Giles, entitled \"Love, Life, Loss And Tea\", released on 28 October 2012. In addition to working with other artists, Pulsford has expressed his intent to release another solo album.\n\nIn June 2010 Bush's return was announced and Chris Traynor, who had played with Gavin Rossdale since Bush ended, was installed as the band's new lead guitarist. Pulsford was joined by bassist Dave Parsons in turning down the opportunity to rejoin the band. \n\nNigel Pulsford married his wife Judith Rose on 20 July 1996. He has three children. They currently live in Bath, UK, where Pulsford owns his store Vintage and Rare Guitars LTD.\n\n"}

(Example: A picture of a kid sitting on a tire in pitch blackness sports the caption \"I believe this is my earliest memory of riding in the car when my family took our annual vacation.\") He shows panels of \"Nature's Way\" and talks about his early struggles as a cartoonist before he established himself in the field. While on vacation from his regular job as an investigator for the local humane society (\"to whom I never disclosed the fact that on the way to the job interview I ran over a dog\"), he left his one and only copy of his portfolio at the headquarters of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", waiting several days until they decided to hire him. After returning home, he received a letter that his local newspaper had decided to discontinue \"Nature's Way\". Larson says that if the letter had arrived a week earlier, \"I never would have made the trip to San Francisco. The wind would definitely have gone out of my sails.\"\n\nLarson explains the creative process he goes through in making cartoons, showing the original doodles in his sketchbook alongside the final published versions. Sometimes he makes large changes to his initial idea, other times the differences are more subtle. (Example: A sketch of \"If Dogs Drove,\" showing canine drivers hanging their heads out the window, was changed to \"When dogs go to work,\" which depicts a bus-full of dogs with their heads hanging out the window.) He discusses the reasons for the changes he makes, and in a few cases he admits that he now prefers an earlier version, or that the final version could have been changed further.\n\nHe also shows doodles that he never published, most of which he admits weren't that funny. (\"Anyone who attaches more significance to them needs to get out more often.\") He then shows several cartoons that were based on little short stories he wrote for a change of pace.\n\nHe devotes one section to mistakes that he made, or that editors made when altering his cartoons for one reason or another. These include incomplete drawings, scientific errors (like one featuring polar bears and penguins in the same habitat), typos in the caption, and the right caption set to the wrong cartoon (one time, a \"Dennis the Menace\" cartoon featuring the kids eating sandwiches was inadvertently—or maybe not so inadvertently—set to the \"Far Side\" caption, \"Oh brother!...Not hamsters again!\", while the \"Far Side\" cartoon got the \"Dennis\" caption—\"Lucky thing I learned to make peanut butter sandwiches or we woulda starved to death by now.\"). In a separate section called \"Subtle Things,\" he discusses the techniques he brings to the cartooning table.\n\nHere Larson shows his cartoons that have provoked controversy, even outrage, and he reprints some of the indignant letters of protest. Some of his cartoons are thought to be in bad taste, as one featuring a couple of dogs playing \"Tethercat.\" In such cases, he argues that readers either were oversensitive or misunderstood the cartoon. One time, a representative of the Jane Goodall Institute attacked a \"Far Side\" cartoon in which two chimpanzees are grooming when one finds a human hair and asks, \"Conducting a little more 'research' with that Jane Goodall tramp?\" Larson was ready to apologize to Goodall, until it came out that Goodall loved the cartoon and had no idea someone in her organization had complained.\n\nA few of his cartoons were controversial simply because they were hard to understand. A particular example was \"Cow Tools,\" which depicts a cow standing by a table on which rest four oddly shaped objects. Larson had found it funny that cows would be really bad at toolmaking. His mistake was making one of the tools resemble a saw, as it led people to believe they had to identify the other tools to understand some kind of deeper meaning. \"'Off days' are a part of life,\" he writes, \"whether you're a cartoonist, a neurosurgeon, or an air-traffic controller.\"\n\nLarson also reprints a letter from an entomologist proposing to name a newly discovered species of chewing lice after Larson, \"Strigiphilus garylarsoni\". The scientist explains that he did this \"to honor the enormous contribution that my colleagues and I feel you have made to biology through your cartoons.\" The image of this insect also appears in the form of a geometric design on the inside front and back covers.\n\nThe next section shows a handful of cartoons that his editors rejected (or, in a few cases, that he never even bothered submitting), usually because they were considered in poor taste. Larson responds to everyone who's taken the trouble to complain, with a large print of a boy making a face.\n\nLarson presents a gallery of his own personal favorite \"Far Side\" cartoons. \"I contemplated making this last section a collection of what I consider the \"lousiest\" cartoons I've ever drawn, but space was limited.\"\n"}

Mercedes-Benz unveiled the W140 S-Class at Geneva Motor Show in March 1991 with sales launch in April 1991 and North American launch in August 1991. The W140 represented the last of old school German engineering from Mercedes-Benz that leaned on overengineering principle, namely \"engineer's car\". As with each generation of S-Class, a plethora of innovations in technology, climate protection, and creature comfort was introduced. Those innovations later trickled down to smaller C-Class and E-Class models over time.\n\nAs with previous generations of S-Class, the W140 was available in two body styles (sedan/saloon and coupé) along with two wheelbase lengths (sedan/saloon only). The standard wheelbase, SE, and long wheelbase, SEL, along with coupé version, SEC, was renamed in 1993 as part of the corporate-wide nomenclature changes for 1994 model year onward, becoming S only regardless of wheelbase length or body style as well as fuel type. A TURBODIESEL label affixed to the right side of the trunk/boot lip was the only visual clue of its diesel engine. In 1996, the S-Class coupé was renamed again as CL-Class and split off to its own model range.\n\nThe W140 gained a notoriety for its substantial appearance with tall roof and larger side windows, described as \"driving safe box\", brick on wheels, moving shoe carton, etc. Emerging concerns for climate protection and the effect of global recessions in the early 1990s targeted the W140 as an ostentatious symbol of excess. A further notoriety for the W140 occurred when Diana, Princess of Wales and two others died in a car crash, involving a S 280 model, in a Paris tunnel. The only survivor sat in the front passenger seat.\n\nThe W140 series S-Class was superseded by the W220 S-Class sedan and C215 CL-Class coupé in 1998 after an eight-year production run.\n\nMercedes-Benz built 432,732 examples of the 140 series, comprising 406,710 sedans and 26,022 coupés.\n\nThe development on the W140 began in 1981, with official introduction originally set in September 1989. Several different design proposals were studied from 1982 until 1986, when a definitive design proposal by Olivier Boulay was selected on 9 December 1986. Several engineering prototypes were evaluated from early 1987, with the final exterior design locked in September 1987. The design patents were filed on 23 February 1988 in Germany and 23 August 1988 in the United States. The lead designer Bruno Sacco attributed Jaguar's XJ40 sedan and BMW's E32 7-Series as a major influence in W140 design. The initial exterior design proposal called for the two different cooling grille designs to denote the lower and upper model, similar to the idea of round and rectangle headlamps on the W123 (1976-1985). Innovative metal-forming technology allowed the extension of the engine hood/bonnet to the front bumper, with the grille placed inside the extruded metal. The W140 became the second model after the R129 (1989-2001) to have this extruded metal grille.\n\nWhen BMW introduced a new 7-Series (E32) in 1986, a first post-war German passenger V12 engine, M70, was offered. This surprise announcement forced Mercedes-Benz to delay the introduction of the W140 by eighteen months to 1991. The delay allowed Mercedes-Benz to develop the new V12 engine and to rearrange the engine bay to accommodate the garguntan V12 engine along with upgrading the brake system. The final development prototypes were completed in June 1990, with pilot production models being built from June 1990 to January 1991.\n\nThe W140 is often known as the last Mercedes-Benz to be \"overengineered\" or \"engineer's car\", a trait which reportedly cost Mercedes-Benz more than $1 billion to develop. The project cost overruns and eighteen-month delay resulted in the departure of Wolfgang Peter, Mercedes-Benz' chief engineer. For the consumers, the price of a W140 was considerably 25 per cent higher than its predecessor, the W126, (up to 25 per cent) leading to slow sales during the recession of 1990-1994. Consequently, Mercedes-Benz shifted from \"engineer's design\" to \"market-driven design\" in the 1990s, resulting in the \"lower quality\" feel to the subsequent vehicles introduced in the late 1990s to 2000s, starting with the W210 (1995-2003).\n\nA stillborn V16 engine based on an elongated V12 engine meant for a hypothetical 800 SEL/S 800 was, again, developed in response to the purported rumour of BMW exploring a V16 engine and testing it in a 7-Series (E32) mule, named Goldfisch V16. Mercedes-Benz had a small fleet of 85 W140 prototypes with V16 engines. Due to the increasing concern for climate protection and fear of sending a wrong message to the public in the early 1990s, the V16 engine was quietly cancelled.\n\nThe updated W140 was unveiled at the 1994 Geneva Auto Salon and went on sale in April 1994.\n\nThe three body types are carried over from the W126: four-door sedan/saloon in two wheelbase lengths and one two-door coupé. The model types are assigned as W140 for standard wheelbase, V140 for long wheelbase, and C140 for coupé. In 1996, S-Class coupé was renamed as CL-Class and spun off from S-Class. A longer Pullman version with 4140 mm wheelbase was introduced in 1995 with two engine choices (S 500 Pullman and S 600 Pullman). The S 600 Pullman could be ordered with armour package.\n\nThe Sultan of Brunei ordered eighteen S 73 T station wagons/estates with AMG-prepared M 297 7.3-litre V12 engines putting out 391 kW (532 PS; 524 hp) and 750 N⋅m (553 lb⋅ft) to be built, with ten units delivered. The S 73 T had an S-Class coupé front end and the rear part of an S210 station wagon/estate installed.\n\nA one-off custom-built S 500 lang Landaulet Popemobile was built for Pope John Paul II in 1997.\n\nThe W140 S-Class introduced several safety innovations which have since become commonplace among many vehicles.\n\nSome innovations for the W140 included:\n\n\nA new generation of inline 6 and V8 petrol engines were developed with double-overhead camshafts (DOHC), four valves per cylinder, and new variable valve timing. Mercedes-Benz's first-ever passenger V12 engine was introduced in 1991 in a response to BMW's 750i/750iL (E32). Only 3.5-litre inline 6 diesel engine, OM 603.97x, was carried over from W126 and remained only engine in W140 model range with two valves per cylinder form until its replacement in 1996. The DOHC, four valves per cylinder, and variable valve timing helped increase the horsepower and torque figures without heavy fuel consumption penalty while reducing the emission. All petrol engines have catalysators during the entire W140 model run regardless of where they were sold.\n\nThe 3.0-litre 24-valve inline 6, M 104.98x, was first introduced in 300 SL-24 and 300 E-24, 300 CE-24, and 300 TE-24 in 1989. This engine, fitted to 300 SE/300 SEL, had a very short run in W140; it was replaced by an upgraded inline 6 engines introduced in 1993 with two displacements. The smaller 2.8-litre M 104.94x engine was fitted to 300 SE 2.8 (one year only) then S 280 (1994-1998). The larger 3.2-litre M 104.99x engine was fitted to 300 SE/300 SEL (one year only) then S 320 (1994-1998).\n\nThe M 119 V8 engines were available in 4.2-litre (M 119 E 42) and 5.0-litre (M 119 E 50) versions and remained unchanged during its entire model run. In 1994, AMG developed a 6.0-litre version (M 119 E 60) with and in a very limited production for Japanese market. The S 500 AMG 6.0 and CL 500 AMG 6.0 were built from 1994 to 1999 per customer order. For 1993, the V8 engines were detuned for improved emission control.\n\nThe M 120 V12 engine was offered in 6.0 litres only for the entire model run. This engine developed 290–300 kW (394–408 PS; 389–402 hp) and 569–580 N⋅m (420–428 lb⋅ft) of torque for the 6.0-litre version. The 300 kW (408 PS; 402 bhp) version was available in Europe from 1991 to 1992 and in the United States for 1992 only. In 1993, the V12 was slightly detuned to 290 kW (394 PS; 389 bhp) for lower emission control. An AMG-prepared 6.0-litre M 120 V12 with higher performance rating, 327 kW (445 PS; 439 hp) and 623 N⋅m (460 lb⋅ft), was not officially available for S-Class sedan/saloon as it was exclusive to CL-Class and SL-Class. \n\nThe 3.5-litre inline 6 diesel engine, OM 603.97x in 300 SD TURBODIESEL (1991-1993) and S 350 TURBODIESEL (1994-1996) was at last offered outside North American and Japanese markets for the first time. This engine was replaced in 1996 by all-new 24-valve OM 606.961 ERE engine. This engine was loosely derived from M 104 petrol engine with different crankshaft and cylinder head. The smaller engine fitted to S 300 TURBODIESEL put out 130 kW (177 PS; 174 hp) and 330 N⋅m (243 lb⋅ft). The fuel was delivered indirectly in the precombustion chamber before entering the combustion chamber.\n\nW140 remains the only S-Class to have wider range of transmissions during its eight-year run. The transmission choices at the introduction was 5-speed manual and 4-speed 4G-Tronic automatic. A new 5-speed 5G-Tronic was introduced in 1994 for inline 6 petrol engines only. In September 1995, 5G-Tronic was updated with electronic control for more optimal shifting points based on the sensor readings and became the sole automatic transmission option for the entire model range from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe models equipped with inline 6 petrol engines have 5-speed manual transmission as standard with either 4-speed or 5-speed automatic transmission as extra-cost options. In June 1996, both 4-speed and 5-speed automatic transmissions were replaced by 5-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. The inline 6 diesel engines were never offered with manual transmissions, following the \"tradition\" with W116 and W126. S 300 TURBODIESEL, introduced in 1996, received the 5-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.\n\nThe models with V8 and V12 engines were offered with 4-speed automatic transmission as standard until August 1995. On September 1995, the 4-speed automatic transmission was replaced by 5-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.\n\n4MATIC, the all-wheel-drive system introduced in W124 (1985-1996), was never fitted to W140 S-Class. W140's successor, W220, became the first S-Class to have 4MATIC as extra-cost option.\n\nThe figures given for acceleration, top speed, and fuel consumption are combination of all types of transmission (5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, 5-speed automatic, and 5-speed electronically controlled automatic) and three body types (standard, long, and coupé) wherever applicable.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867823", "title": "New trade theory", "text": "New trade theory\n\nNew trade theory (NTT) is a collection of economic models in international trade which focuses on the role of increasing returns to scale and network effects, which were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nNew trade theorists relaxed the assumption of constant returns to scale, and some argue that using protectionist measures to build up a huge industrial base in certain industries will then allow those sectors to dominate the world market.\n\nLess quantitative forms of a similar \"infant industry\" argument against totally free trade have been advanced by trade theorists since at least 1791 (see: History of free trade).\n\nThe value of protecting \"infant industries\" has been defended at least since the 18th century; for example, Alexander Hamilton proposed in 1791 that this be the basis for US trade policy. What was \"new\" in new trade theory was the use of mathematical economics to model the increasing returns to scale, and especially the use of the network effect to argue that the formation of important industries was path dependent in a way which industrial planning and judicious tariffs might control.\n\nThe models developed predicted the national specialization-by-industry observed in the industrial world (movies in Hollywood, watches in Switzerland, etc.). The model also showed how path-dependent industrial concentrations can sometimes lead to monopolistic competition or even situations of oligopoly.\n\nSome economists, such as Ha-Joon Chang, had argued that protectionist policies had facilitated the development of the Japanese auto industries in the 1950s, when quotas and regulations prevented import competition. Japanese companies were encouraged to import foreign production technology but were required to produce 90% of parts domestically within five years. Japanese consumers suffered in the short term by being unable to buy superior vehicles produced by the world market, but eventually gained by having a local industry that could out-compete their international rivals.\n\nThe econometric evidence for NTT was mixed, and highly technical. Due to the timescales required, and the particular nature of production in each 'monopolizable' sector, statistical judgements were hard to make. In many ways, the available data have been too limited to produce a reliable test of the hypothesis, which doesn't require arbitrary judgements from the researchers. \n\nJapan is cited as evidence of the benefits of \"intelligent\" protectionism, but critics of NTT have argued that the empirical support post-war Japan offers for beneficial protectionism is unusual, and that the NTT argument is based on a selective sample of historical cases. Although many examples (like Japanese cars) can be cited where a 'protected' industry subsequently grew to world status, regressions on the outcomes of such \"industrial policies\" (which include failures) have been less conclusive; some findings suggest that sectors targeted by Japanese industrial policy had decreasing returns to scale and did not experience productivity gains.\n\nThe theory was initially associated with Paul Krugman in the late 1970s; Krugman claims that he heard about monopolistic competition from Robert Solow. Looking back in 1996 Krugman wrote that International economics a generation earlier had completely ignored \"returns to scale.\"\n\"The idea that trade might reflect an overlay of increasing-returns specialization on comparative advantage was not there at all: instead, the ruling idea was that increasing returns would simply alter the pattern of comparative advantage.\" In 1976, however, MIT-trained economist Victor Norman had worked out the central elements of what came to be known as the Helpman–Krugman theory. He wrote it up and showed it to Avinash Dixit. However, they both agreed the results were not very significant. Indeed, Norman never had the paper typed up, much less published. Norman's formal stake in the race comes from the final chapters of the famous Dixit–Norman book, \"Theory of International Trade\".\n\nJames Brander, a PhD student at Stanford at the time, was undertaking similarly innovative work using models from industrial organisation theory—cross-hauling—to explain two-way trade in similar products.\n\nMarc Melitz and Pol Antràs started a new trend in the study of international trade. While new trade theory put emphasis on the growing trend of intermediate goods, this new trend emphasizes firm level differences in the same industry of the same country and this new trend is frequently called 'new' new trade theory (NNTT). NNTT stresses the importance of firms rather than sectors in understanding the challenges and the opportunities countries face in the age of globalization.\n\nAs international trade is increasingly liberalized, industries of comparative advantage are expected to expand, while those of comparative disadvantage are expected to shrink, leading to an uneven spatial distribution of the corresponding economic activities. Within the very same industry, some firms are not able to cope with international competition while others thrive. The resulting intra-industry reallocations of market shares and productive resources are much more pronounced than inter-industry reallocations driven by comparative advantage.\n\nA new conspicuous phenomenon in the recent world trade is the rise of trade of in intermediate goods and services. A study of OECD has found that \"intermediate inputs represent 56% of goods trade and 73% of services trade.\" This is a result of fragmentation of production and the increasing importance of outsourcing, which were in turn a result of rapid decrease of trade costs (including transportation costs, transaction costs and tariffs) and revolutionary development of information and communications technologies. Trade in intermediate products are related to many phenomena such as offshoring, vertical specialization, global sourcing, the Second Unbundling, trade in value added, trade in tasks, global supply chains, global value chains, global optimal procurement. In short it is one of motive powers of internationalization and globalization.\n\nTraditional trade theories including Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson theory and the New trade theory à la Krugman exclude trade of intermediates products by assumption and cannot explain fragmentation of production across countries. Fragmentation was first studied by Ronald Jones and Henryk Kierzowski (1990). They explained the fragmentation by the decrease of service link costs. Yoshinori Shiozawa (2017, Section 13) presented a new explanation by the decrease of trade costs. The service link explains how fragmentation occurs but does not explain how a pattern of specialization emerges. Trade cost explanation is naturally incorporated in Shiozawa's theory of international trade and can be used in the account of global value chain emergence, because it is a general framework which permits trade of intermediate goods and services.\n\nNew trade theory and \"new\" new trade theory (NNTT) need their own trade theory. New trade theories are often based on assumptions such as monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. One of the typical explanations, given by Paul Krugman, depends on the assumption that all firms are symmetrical, meaning that they all have the same production coefficients. This is too strict as an assumption and deprived general applicability of Krugman's explanation. Shiozawa, based on much more general model, succeeded in giving a new explanation on why the traded volume increases for intermediates goods when the transport cost decreases.\n\n\"New\" new trade theory (NNTT) also needs new theoretical foundation. Melitz and his followers concentrate on empirical aspects and pay little interest on theoretical aspects of NNTT. Shiozawa's new construction, or Ricardo-Sraffa trade theory, enables Ricardian trade theory to include choice of techniques. Thus the theory can treat a situation where there are many firms with different production processes. Based on this new theory, Fujimoto and Shiozawa analyze how different production sites, either of competing firms or of the same firms locating in the different countries, compete.\n\n\n"}

His paternal grandfather was of Irish descent and his maternal grandmother was of Swedish descent. He was raised in Abilene, Kansas, and attended Kansas grade schools in Russell, Salina, and Industry. Doocy went to junior high in Wakefield and high school in Clay Center, Kansas. He graduated from the University of Kansas, in Lawrence, with a BS in Journalism. He was the first on-air DJ for KJHK radio, the student-operated radio station at 90.7 FM in Lawrence.\n\nEarly in his career, Doocy anchored the morning newscast on CBS-TV's flagship station, WCBS-TV, in New York City. Previously, he was the co-host of \"Wake Up America\" on NBC cable and host of the nationally syndicated program \"House Party with Steve Doocy\", a remake of the 1960s Art Linkletter show, and the host of the syndicated kids' series \"Not Just News\". For six years, Doocy was the Emmy Award-winning features reporter for WRC, in Washington, D.C., and the NBC Television Stations division. His early television posts included news reporter positions in Kansas City, Wichita, Topeka, and Des Moines. He was the live Times Square reporter on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" on ABC-TV for four ball drops.\n\nDoocy joined the Fox News Channel in 1996, and began co-hosting the network's morning show \"Fox & Friends\" in 1998. In 2004, he helped launch Fox News Channel's New Year's Eve special, \"All American New Year\", whose hosts have included Bill Hemmer and Megyn Kelly.\n\nThe Fox & Friends program gained prominence after the presidential election of Donald Trump, who had been a regular on-air contributor to the program for a number of years before the campaign. Once elected, Trump called it, \"the most honest morning show.\" During his first year as president, Trump continued to watch and often quoted the program on Twitter. This prompted the New York Times to call Fox & Friends \"the most powerful TV show in America.\"\n\nDoocy is implicated in Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit against Roger Ailes. The lawsuit alleges: \"Doocy engaged in a pattern and practice of severe and pervasive sexual harassment of Carlson, including, but not limited to, mocking her during commercial breaks, shunning her off air, refusing to engage with her on air, belittling her contributions to the show, and generally attempting to put her in her place by refusing to accept and treat her as an intelligent and insightful female journalist rather than a blond female prop.\" According to the complaint, Doocy \"created a hostile work environment by regularly treating her in a sexist and condescending way, including by putting his hand on her and pulling down her arm to shush her during a live telecast.\"\n\nIn 2019, it was revealed that President Donald Trump ranked the loyalty of many reporters, on a scale of 1 to 10. Steve Doocy received a \"12 out of 10.\" \n\nDoocy has written two \"New York Times\" bestsellers. The first is about marriage and family life, titled \"The Mr. and Mrs. Happy Handbook\".

The R230 underwent revisions in 2006 and 2008, and was superseded by the new SL-Class R231 in 2011.\n\nIn early 1996, over 6 years into the life of the R129, development work on a successor began. On 27 January 1996 design work commenced and draft designs were submitted from ten designers in Germany, California, and Japan. Hundreds of sketches were submitted and would form the basis for twelve quarter scale models which were digitized for computer manipulation. Design of the R230 would progress through two different formats. The real world process centered on the traditional 1:4 scale models, with most of them initially being done clay. Virtual world design development took place in a room packed with state-of-the-art computer processing technology referred to as the “CAVE.” This technology was also used earlier on to design the W203 in 1995.\n\nThe supercomputer in the “CAVE” (Computer Aided Virtual Environment) was able to create full-size images of selected designs, using its five projectors and allowing designers to inspect every inch of every surface rendered. Parallel to the virtual process, the twelve scale models were scrutinized as well, with four standouts chosen to be created in full-size mockups. This evolution of the scale models occurred alongside the development of the interior design. On 16 June 1997, the final design for the R230 was approved by the board and refined into production specifications into 1998. The design patents for the R230 were later filed in Germany on 9 September 1999 and on 1 March 2000 in the United States.\n\nIn July 2001, after over 5 years of development, the new SL was unveiled and introduced at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show that September.) Production began on 13 October 2001 at the Bremen plant and European sales commenced that November.\n\nThis car first appeared as the Safety Car for Formula One at the 2001 German Grand Prix in Hockenheim. The street version was unveiled at the 2001 IAA. The range was launched with a film style advertisement called \"Lucky Star\".\n\nThe SL underwent a facelift in 2006, and was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\nChanges include new engines for SL 350 and SL 500 (called SL 550 in North America), with improved performance on SL 55 AMG and SL 600, as well as a new top-of-the-line SL 65 AMG. ABC (Active Body Control) was improved to reduce body movements in dynamic driving by up to 60%, standard on all models except the SL 350. The new engines were mated to a new 7-speed 7G-Tronic automatic, with a Sport option to allow shifting to be performed up to 30% faster in manual \"M\" mode, and with added steering-wheel shift paddles.\n\nExterior styling changes include a new bumper with three large cooling air intakes and a more pronounced V-shape as well as fog lamps with chrome surrounds, new light-alloy wheels, new rear light. Interior changes include softer leather upholstery, new interior colours, high-quality metal door sills with Mercedes-Benz lettering and embossed aluminium trim elements, removable luggage cover, optional remote boot-lid release. The roof opening mechanism was also revised, reducing the opening time from 20-seconds to 16-seconds.\n\n2007 - 50th Anniversary Edition SL 550\n\nWith the 2007 model year, there was a limited production model (550 units) introduced to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the SL roadster model. This Anniversary Edition version came with a pewter metallic exterior, cognac brown leather interior with black ash wood trim, 382 HP V-8, exclusive twin-Spoke rims, custom luggage bag for rear shelf, and many other standard options and features.\n\nThe facelifted SL model was revealed in the Geneva Motor Show in March 2008. The SL received a new, more aggressive front end reflecting Mercedes's new design philosophy, with a pair of long powerdomes on the bonnet and a single-bar grille replacing the old three-bar effort. Improvements have been made also on the engines. The 3.5L V6 is uprated to at 6500 rpm. Compared to the previous 3.5-litre engine, the output has been boosted by 16 percent. Torque has also been improved adding to the previous making it . This engine now can rev up to a max of 7200 rpm for a period as the oil temperature and other engine parameters permit, a higher compression ratio, a new intake manifold and featuring extensive modifications to and lightening of the valve train. In this case, however, the extra power does not come at the expense of fuel economy: with a consumption figure of 9.9 litres per 100 kilometres, the new SL 350 undercuts the previous model developing by 0.4 litres per 100 kilometres. Mercedes-Benz is extending the SL-Class line-up by introducing an attractive entry-level model in the shape of the SL 280 developing . The six cylinder powerplant delivers its peak torque of from 2500 rpm and accelerates the roadster from 0 to in 7.8 seconds, whilst fuel consumption (NEDC) is just . It features the AIRSCARF heating system used in the SLK.\n\nThe facelifted SL loses AMG's 5.4L M113 in favour of the newer M156 6.2L V8 used in the S63 AMG, CLK63 AMG and C63 AMG. It produces at 6800 rpm and of torque at 5200 rpm. It can accelerate from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.6 seconds going up to a limited top speed of . The SL 63 AMG also includes the new AMG-developed 7-speed MCT \"Multi Clutch Technology\" automatic transmission.\n\nThe new MCT transmission is essentially the 7G-Tronic transmission without a torque converter. Instead of a torque converter, it uses a compact wet startup clutch to start the car off, and also supports computer-controlled double declutching. The MCT (Multi-Clutch Technology) acronym refers to a planetary (automatic) transmission's multiple clutches and bands for each gear.\n\nThe MCT is fitted with four drive modes: “C” (Comfort), “S” (Sport), “S+” (Sport plus) and “M” (Manual) and boasts 100 millisecond shifts in \"M\" mode. The new car features the new AMG DRIVE UNIT with innovative Race Start function. The AMG DRIVE UNIT is the central control unit for the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission and all driving dynamics functions. The driver can change gears either using the new AMG selector lever with its leather/ carbon-fibre finish, or by nudging the AMG steering-wheel shift paddles. The new Race start Function is a launch control system which enables the SL 63 AMG driver to call on maximum acceleration, while ensuring optimum traction of the driven wheels. A modified version of the SL 63 was the Safety Car for the Formula One seasons of and .\n\nThe new SL 65 AMG Black Series coupe features a carbon-fiber fixed roof, front fenders, hood, trunk lid, and front and rear aprons. With the absence of retractable roof hardware, the car is more than lighter than the standard SL. AMG placed a modified version of the 6.0-liter AMG V12 engine that now delivers and of torque. This is the same 6.0L engine as used in the previous SL 65 model with remapped timing and fuel curves to produce 58 PS more. Torque remains the same, as the previous model, due to transmission limitations. This engine has been labeled as the engine with the largest output that will be made by AMG. Its twin turbochargers are 12 percent larger, passages for intake air and the turbo wastegates have been modified, and the intake air intercooler is 30 percent more efficient. The result is 0-to- acceleration of 3.8 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of .\n\nIt is a limited (200 units) version of SL 63 AMG. It included Designo Magno Kashmir white finish, AMG Exterior Carbon package with matte surface, interior Carbon matte trim with Tobago Brown nappa leather upholstery, AMG Performance package, 'Grosse Ingenieur' (Big Engineer) watch from Swiss watchmaker IWC Schaffhausen.\n\nThe vehicle went on sale beginning in fall 2008, with deliveries beginning in November 2008.\n\nThe performance version of the SL 65 AMG was unveiled in Monterey in 2008. The turbochargers are 12% larger, and the optimised wastegate ducts permit increased air throughout. The intake air ducting and exhaust system are modified to improve response and reduce the exhaust gas backpressure. The Black Series is lighter than regular SL 65 AMG by the use of light carbon fibre composite (CFRP) parts and the omission of the SL's normal foldable hardtop roof, replacing it with a fixed roof. Not only did this save weight, it also made room available for the retractable rear spoiler. It also has an def limited top speed of about 200 mph-(322 km/h) and can go from 0-62 mph-(0–100 km/h) in 3.8 seconds.\n\nThe AMG Speedshift Plus five-speed automatic transmission include \"C\", \"S\", \"M1\" and \"M2\" which has gearshift times 25 percent quicker than the \"M1\" mode. The Black Series front axle track width is 97 millimetres wider and the rear axle track width 85 millimetres wider over regular model. Other changes include retractable rear spoiler and the rear apron with diffuser fins, 265/35R19 front tyres with 19x9.5 inch AMG light-alloy wheels and AMG 20x11.5-inch light-alloy wheels with 325/30R20 tyres (Dunlop Sport Maxx GT tyres), 6-piston front calipers with 390x36mm discs and 4-piston calipers with 360x26mm discs.\n\nIt is a version of SL roadster with 19-inch AMG five-spoke light-alloy wheels in a two-tone high-gloss finish, silver-painted front brake callipers with the Mercedes-Benz logo, darkened headlamps/tail lights, black nappa leather upholstery with shining chrome trim, seats with arrow-shaped seams and silver-coloured contrasting features, sports steering wheel and shift lever and roof lining in black, trim strip of the draught-stop has a high-gloss finish, silver-coloured vents at AIRSCARF system.\n\nIt is a version of SL 300, SL 350, and SL 500 commemorating 125th anniversary of Karl Benz inventing the automobile.\n\nSL 350 Grand Edition included 19-inch AMG 5-spoke alloy wheel in titanium, front brake callipers with the Mercedes-Benz logo, drill bench rated brake discs, twin chrome square exhaust tips, chrome shoulder line trim, high gloss door handle, Grand Edition side emblem, nappa leather seat, SLR design shift knob, prism pattern aluminium trim, silver colour AIRSCARF vent, chrome door sill plate, chrome draught strap, floor mat with Grand Edition logo, ashtray with Grand Edition logo. Other options include AMG sport package, designo piano lacquer black wood trim.\n\nSL 500 Grand Edition included 19-inch AMG 5-spoke alloy wheel in titanium, front brake callipers with the Mercedes-Benz logo, drill bench rated brake discs, twin chrome square exhaust tips, chrome shoulder line trim, high gloss door handle, Grand Edition side emblem, SLR design shift knob, designo piano lacquer black wood trim, silver colour AIRSCARF vent, chrome door sill plate, chrome draught strap, floor mat with Grand Edition logo, ashtray with Grand Edition logo. Other options include AMG sport package.\n\nJapan model went on sale in 2011-08-05.\n\nSL 63 AMG includes AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission, which included 'C' (Comfort), 'S' (Sport), 'S+' (Sport plus) and 'M' (Manual) modes, AMG DRIVE UNIT, Race Start launch control.\n\nThe SL 63 AMG engine was built in Mercedes-AMG.\n\nIn 2007, Mercedes created a 75 limited-edition 50th Anniversary SL 550s. According to another article, Mercedes created 550 of these cars, all pewter in colour with burgundy leather, black ash wood trim, 18-inch double five-spoked wheels, and matching 50th Anniversary Edition luggage.\n\nThe SL 600 is the highest-powered version of the non-AMG SL-Class models.

It was known to have been used in Ancient Egypt, Rome, and Greece. \n\nA type of folding chair with a frame like an \"X\" viewed from the front or the side originated in medieval Italy. Also known as a Savonarola or \"Dante chair\" in Italy, or a \"Luther chair\" in Germany, the X-chair was a light and practical form that spread through Renaissance Europe. In England, the Glastonbury chair made an X-shape by crossing the front and back legs, while in Spain X-chairs were inlaid with ivory and metals in the Moorish designs.\n\nThe use of the name Savonarola chair comes from a nineteenth-century trade term evoking Girolamo Savonarola, which is a folding armchair of the type standardized during the Italian Renaissance.\n\nThe chair in the illustration consists of a wooden flat-arched back rail carved with a coat-of-arms in low relief and connected to the back of the straight arms of the chair and a seat made of narrowly fitted wooden slats. The wood used in the construction of the chair is the typical walnut, as in other gothic and renaissance furniture.\n\nThe woodwork was nearly always completely covered with silk or velvet, and the seat was made up of loose cushions resting on the webbing between the side rails of the frames.

The following will provide an overview of English courses and tests, costs and applications as well as where you can study ELICOS across Australia.\n\nEnglish language courses vary greatly, depending on where you are studying. You will get a different experience going to small group tuition, secondary school/college, university or a vocational education centre. Think about what stage you are at in life and where you would like to take the next step. Do you need to obtain a high school qualification, would you like to enrol in TAFE or attend university? This will largely influence what English course you undertake.\n\nCRICOS stands for Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. If an ELICOS provider has met the national standards, then they will be registered with CRICOS, so it is very important to verify this before you sign the dotted line with any education institution. You can confirm the registration on the CRICOS website.\n\nOn the site, you can see all of the Australian education providers that offer courses to people studying in Australia on student visas (and the courses that are offered). Navigating the site is simple, as you can find relevant information with the course or institution search. The government site also provides information about registration of institutions and courses for overseas students.\n\nThere are quite a few options for potential students regarding the selection of an English course. This also applies to English tests. The following tests are accepted for Australian Student Visa purposes:\n\nIELTS – International English Language Testing System test.\n\nTOEFL iBT – Test of English as a Foreign Language internet-Based test OR TOEFL PBT – TOEFL Paper-Based Test (where IELTS is not available).\n\nPTE – Pearson Test of English.\n\nCAE – Cambridge English: Advanced test (Certificate in Advanced English), and the\n\nOET – Occupational English Test for healthcare professionals who want to register and work in an English-speaking environment.\n\nThere are three main ways that you can apply to study ELICOS in Australia. The first is by applying directly to the school. The ELICOS website provides users with a list of all ELICOS English colleges across Australia. Many of these colleges are quality endorsed by NEAS Australia.\n\nThe second way you can apply is through IE (Australian Education International). Contact your local IE office for further information.\n\nFinally, the third way in which you can apply to ELICOS is through a private education agent representing the schools. You can find an agent by contacting the Australian Embassy in the first instance and asking to be connected to an ‘Education Agent’.\n\nThe cost of tuition will vary depending on where you are studying. This can vary from approximately AUD$250 per week up to AUD$350 per week (this involves about 25 hours of tuition in the week of study). If you are attending an ELICOS course of study in a main city such as Sydney or Melbourne, the costs will inevitably be a bit higher than in more rural or smaller communities. Adelaide, Perth and Hobart tend to be less expensive than the mainland cities on the eastern coast of Australia, so if you are concerned about finances (including living expenses) then consider these locations as an alternative.\n\nThere are at least half a dozen places to study ELICOS in each main city across Australia so make sure you choose wisely, taking all factors into account including cost of living, accommodation, transport, testing requirements and restrictions\n"}

The origin of the dubbel was a strong version of a brown beer brewed in Westmalle Abbey in 1856, which is known to have been on sale to the public by June 1861. In 1926, the recipe was changed, and it was sold as \"Dubbel Bruin\". Following World War Two, abbey beers became popular in Belgium and the name \"dubbel\" was used by several breweries for commercial purposes.\n\nWestmalle's Dubbel was imitated by other breweries across the world, both Trappist and secular, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are now understood to be a fairly strong (6%-8% alcohol by volume) brown ale, with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character. \n\nChimay Première (Red), Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, and Achel 8 Bruin are notable examples from Trappist breweries. Affligem and Grimbergen are Belgian abbey breweries that produce dubbels.\n\nNotable examples from the US include Ommegang's Dubbel and New Belgium's Abbey Ale.\n\nAbbey 1856 Dubbel is produced in Argentina.\n\nDubbels are characteristically known for being dark brown in colour with a strong flavour of dark fruit including raisins, prunes, and dates. These flavours and colours are almost entirely resultant from the heavy addition of highly caramelized (or kilned) beet sugar, which ferments completely into alcohol, lightening the body of the finished beer and contributing to its dry finish. The caramelization of the beet sugar is also the major contributor of maillard flavors including chocolatey, caramel, and nutty tones that give the dubbel its wide gamut of flavour complexity. Because of the special strains of ale yeast used in their production, dubbels often carry a mild spice; coriander and black pepper are notable examples in traditional Belgian dubbels.\n\n\n"}

It is characterized by openwork, which allows the surface of the underlying object to show through.\n\nDoiley was a 17th-century London draper, who made popular \"a woolen stuff, 'at once cheap and genteel,' introduced for summer wear in the latter part of the 17th c.\" At the time, it was used as an adjective, as in \"doily stuffs\" or \"doily suit.\" Later, usage shifted to refer to \"a small ornamental napkin used at dessert,\" known as a \"doily-napkin.\"\n\nIn addition to their decorative function doilies have the practical role of protecting fine-wood furniture from the scratches caused by crockery or decorative objects such as nativity scenes, or from spilled tea when used on tea trays or with cups and saucers. When used to protect the backs and arms of chairs, they are serving as antimacassars.\n\nDoilies are traditionally used to bind the stems in posies (formal flower arrangements called tussie-mussies in the Victorian Era).\n\nDoilies figure prominently in the custom of finger bowls, once common in formal, multi-course dinners. The linen doily (never paper) separates the dessert plate from the finger bowl. The custom requires that both doily and finger bowl are removed to the upper left of the place setting before briefly dipping fingertips into the water and drying them on the napkin. Failing to move both together is a faux pas. \nDisposable paper doilies \"were designed as a cheaper but respectable alternative to crocheted linen doilies\" and are commonly used to decorate plates, placed under the food for ornamentation. In the UK, \"sales rocketed in the 1950s as a reaction to post-war austerity and the doily quickly became a symbol of upward social mobility.\" However, the UK is currently experiencing a decline, prompting a \"Save our Doilies\" campaign. Once \"a symbol of suburban gentility\" they are now perceived as outdated.\n\nThey are crocheted, tatted or knitted out of cotton or linen thread. Many patterns for crocheting or knitting doilies were published by thread manufacturers in the first part of the 20th century. The designers were often anonymous. The designs could be circular or oval starting from the center and working outward, reminiscent of the Polar coordinates system. Doilies, as well as other household items, may be made by crocheting rows on a grid pattern using a technique called filet crochet, similar to points on the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nContemporary designers continue to make patterns for modern hand craft enthusiasts. Although it may to some extent interfere with the original use, some doilies involve embroidery or have raised designs (rose petals, popcorn, or ruffles) rather than being flat.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867853", "title": "Business rules engine", "text": "Business rules engine\n\nA business rules engine is a software system that executes one or more business rules in a runtime production environment. The rules might come from legal regulation (\"An employee can be fired for any reason or no reason but not for an illegal reason\"), company policy (\"All customers that spend more than $100 at one time will receive a 10% discount\"), or other sources. A business rule system enables these company policies and other operational decisions to be defined, tested, executed and maintained separately from application code.\n\nRule engines typically support rules, facts, priority (score), mutual exclusion, preconditions, and other functions.\n\nRule engine software is commonly provided as a component of a business rule management system which, among other functions, provides the ability to: register, define, classify, and manage all the rules, verify consistency of rules definitions (”Gold-level customers are eligible for free shipping when order quantity > 10” and “maximum order quantity for Silver-level customers = 15” ), define the relationships between different rules, and relate some of these rules to IT applications that are affected or need to enforce one or more of the rules.\n\nIn any IT application, business rules can change more frequently than other parts of the application code. Rules engines or inference engines serve as pluggable software components which execute business rules that a business rules approach has externalized or separated from application code. This externalization or separation allows business users to modify the rules without the need for IT intervention. The system as a whole becomes more easily adaptable with such external business rules, but this does not preclude the usual requirements of QA and other testing.\n\nAn article in \"Computerworld\" traces rules engines to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.\n\nMany organizations' rules efforts combine aspects of what is generally considered workflow design with traditional rule design. This failure to separate the two approaches can lead to problems with the ability to re-use and control both business rules and workflows. Design approaches that avoid this quandary separate the role of business rules and workflows as follows:\n\n\nConcretely, that means that a business rule may do things like detect that a business situation has occurred and raise a business event (typically carried via a messaging infrastructure) or create higher level business knowledge (e.g., evaluating the series of organizational, product, and regulatory-based rules concerning whether or not a loan meets underwriting criteria). On the other hand, a workflow would respond to an event that indicated something such as the overloading of a routing point by initiating a series of activities.\n\nThis separation is important because the same business judgment (mortgage meets underwriting criteria) or business event (router is overloaded) can be reacted to by many different workflows. Embedding the work done in response to rule-driven knowledge creation into the rule itself greatly reduces the ability of business rules to be reused across an organization because it makes them work-flow specific.\n\nTo create an architecture that employs a business rules engine it is essential to establish the integration between a BPM (Business Process Management) and a BRM (Business Rules Management) platform that is based upon processes responding to events or examining business judgments that are defined by business rules. There are some products in the marketplace that provide this integration natively. In other situations this type of abstraction and integration will have to be developed within a particular project or organization.\n\nMost Java-based rules engines provide a technical call-level interface, based on the JSR-94 application programming interface (API) standard, in order to allow for integration with different applications, and many rule engines allow for service-oriented integrations through Web-based standards such as WSDL and SOAP.\n\nMost rule engines provide the ability to develop a data abstraction that represents the business entities and relationships that rules should be written against. This business entity model can typically be populated from a variety of sources including XML, POJOs, flat files, etc. There is no standard language for writing the rules themselves. Many engines use a Java-like syntax, while some allow the definition of custom business-friendly languages.\n\nMost rules engines function as a callable library. However, it is becoming more popular for them to run as a generic process akin to the way that RDBMSs behave. Most engines treat rules as a configuration to be loaded into their process instance, although some are actually code generators for the whole rule execution instance and others allow the user to choose.\n\nThere are a number of different types of rule engines. These types (generally) differ in how Rules are scheduled for execution.\n\nMost rules engines used by businesses are forward chaining, which can be further divided into two classes: \nThe biggest difference between these types is that production rule engines execute when a user or application invokes them, usually in a stateless manner. A reactive rule engine reacts automatically when events occur, usually in a stateful manner. Many (and indeed most) popular commercial rule engines have both production and reaction rule capabilities, although they might emphasize one class over another. For example, most business rules engines are primarily production rules engines, whereas complex event processing rules engines emphasize reaction rules.\n\nIn addition, some rules engines support backward chaining. In this case a rules engine seeks to resolve the facts to fit a particular goal. It is often referred to as being goal driven because it tries to determine if something exists based on existing information.\n\nAnother kind of rule engine automatically switches between back- and forward-chaining several times during a reasoning run, e.g. the Internet Business Logic system, which can be found by searching the web.\n\nA fourth class of rules engine might be called a deterministic engine. These rules engines may forgo both forward chaining and backward chaining, and instead utilize domain-specific language approaches to better describe policy. This approach is often easier to implement and maintain, and provides performance advantages over forward or backward chaining systems.\n\nThere are some circumstance where Fuzzy Logic based inference may be more appropriate, where heuristics are used in rule processing, rather than Boolean rules. Examples might include customer classification, missing data inference, customer value calculations, etc. The DARL language and the associated inference engine and editors is an example of this approach.\n\nOne common use case for rules engines is standardized access control to applications. OASIS defines a rules engine architecture and standard dedicated to access control called XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language).\nOne key difference between a XACML rule engine and a business rule engine is the fact that a XACML rule engine is stateless and cannot change the state of any data.\nThe XACML rule engine, called a Policy Decision Point (PDP), expects a binary Yes/No question e.g. \"Can Alice view document D?\" and returns a decision e.g. Permit / deny.\n\n\n\n"}

It ran from 1994 to 1999.\n\nBilled as \"Newfoundland's Cultural Magazine\", \"The Great Eastern\" was an hour-long summer replacement show on CBC Radio One for the first two seasons, and then became a half-hour regular show for the next three seasons. Purportedly a culture, arts and entertainment show on the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland (BCN), \"The Great Eastern\" was in fact a satirical and parodic comedy which developed an extensive fictional universe of characters and Newfoundland institutions.\n\n\"The Great Eastern\" purported to be a long-running show on the BCN of which hour-long and half-hour-long segments were broadcast on Radio One (and, through atmospheric anomalies, to Iceland). It was named, both in real life and in fiction, after the ill-fated 19th-century steamship bearing the same name.\n\nAlthough content varied from episode to episode, most started with theme music, moved to a hearty introduction and hello from host Paul Moth, a visit to BCN director Ish Lundrigan and the BCN vault for \"archival\" radio content, the \"What's that noise from Newfoundland\" contest, and then to the meat of the show, which might involve anything from discussions of the religion/get-rich-quick scheme Economology to Newfoundland Christmas radio plays. Interspersed in most episodes were \"community announcements\" and promotional material for other BCN shows which further established the world of \"The Great Eastern\".\n\nA central conceit of \"The Great Eastern\" was that its characters never broke the fourth wall to suggest that the show, despite its outlandish content, was anything other than real. Its creators actively resisted the CBC's attempts to market it to listeners as a comedy. In 1996, co-creator Mack Furlong wrote to the CBC to protest this practice: \"Part of whatever charm \"The Great Eastern\" possesses is gained in no small way by the fact that we purport that the show is real, that it is actually, Nfld's Cultural Magazine. The straighter CBC plays this line, the funnier the concept is... Every good joke needs a straight set up.\"\n\nA number of prominent Canadians appeared on the show as themselves or playing characters, including Andy Jones, Rick Mercer and Margaret Atwood.\n\nSome recurring characters on \"The Great Eastern\" were:\n\n\nInstitutions and locations in \"The Great Eastern\" universe included:\n\nThe real-world Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland ceased transmission in 1949 when it was absorbed into the CBC after Newfoundland joined Confederation.

The BCN was based in a former abattoir on Duckworth Street in St. John's, proudly broadcasting \"coal-fired radio\" from its transmitter tower atop Mount Scio.\n\n\"The Great Eastern\" was supposedly one show as part of a full week's roster of programming on the BCN. The full show was supposedly two and a half hours long, with Canadian listeners tuning in only to the final half-hour of the show. Promotional material for other shows was frequently heard during \"The Great Eastern\", including:\n\nThe show was written by Mack Furlong, Steven Palmer, and Ed Riche, and produced by Glen Tilley, although to maintain the illusion of \"The Great Eastern\" as being a \"real\" show this was never mentioned on the show itself except during the closing credits of some seasons, when they were referred to as the BCN's \"legal team.\"\n\n\"The Great Eastern\" developed a fairly large group of fans; however, late in the show's run the CBC attempted to cut the budget and suggest script changes aimed at making the show more accessible. The last episode of \"The Great Eastern\" aired in 1999 and, apart from a 2002 one-off celebrating the life of Guglielmo Marconi, the show never returned to the CBC.\n\nThe creators' papers have been donated to the archives of the Memorial University of Newfoundland.\n\nGerry Porter maintains a detailed site on the show—it includes complete episodes in MP3 format amongst other content.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867864", "title": "Heating degree day", "text": "Heating degree day\n\nHeating degree day (HDD) is a measurement designed to quantify the demand for energy needed to heat a building. HDD is derived from measurements of outside air temperature. The heating requirements for a given building at a specific location are considered to be directly proportional to the number of HDD at that location.\n\nRelated measurements include the cooling degree day (CDD), which quantifies demand for air conditioning.\n\nHeating degree days are defined relative to a base temperature—the outside temperature above which a building needs no heating. Base temperatures may be defined for a particular building as a function of the temperature that the building is heated to, or it may be defined for a country or region for example. In the latter case, building standards or conventions may exist for the temperature threshold. These include:\n\nThe base temperature does not necessarily correspond to the building mean internal temperature, as standards may consider mean building insulation levels and internal gains to determine an average external temperature at which heating will be required. Base temperatures of 16 °C and 19 °C (61, 66 °F) are also used. The variation in choice of base temperature implies that HDD values cannot always be compared – care must be taken to ensure that only HDDs with equal base temperatures are compared.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which HDD can be calculated: the more detailed a record of temperature data, the more accurate the HDD that can be calculated. HDD are often calculated using simple approximation methods that use daily temperature readings instead of more detailed temperature records such as half-hourly readings, the latter of which can be used to estimate an integral. One popular approximation method, that used by the U.S. National Weather Service, is to take the average temperature on any given day (the mean of the high and low temperature) and subtract it from the base temperature. If the value is less than or equal to zero, that day has zero HDD. But if the value is positive, that number represents the number of HDD on that day. (For cooling degree days, the process works in reverse: the base temperature is subtracted from the average, and if \"this\" value is positive, that number represents the CDD.) This method works satisfactorily if the outside air temperature does not exceed the base temperature. In climates where this is likely to occur from time to time, there are refinements to the simple calculation which allow some 'credit' for the period of the day when the air is warm enough for heating to be unnecessary. This more accurate algorithm enables results to be computed in temperate climates (maritime as well as continental) throughout the year (not just during a defined heating season) and on a weekly as well as monthly basis.\n\nHDD can be added over periods of time to provide a rough estimate of seasonal heating requirements. In the course of a heating season, for example, the number of HDD for New York City is 5,050 whereas that for Barrow, Alaska is 19,990. Thus, one can say that, for a given home of similar structure and insulation, around four times the energy would be required to heat the home in Barrow than in New York. Likewise, a similar home in Miami, Florida, whose heating degree days for the heating season is 500, would require around one tenth of the energy required to heat the house in New York City.\n\nHowever, this is a theoretical approach as the level of insulation of a building affects the demand for heating. For example, temperatures often drop below the base temperature during night (daily low temperature in diurnal variation), but because of insulation, heating is unnecessary. In the end of spring and in the beginning of fall or in the winter depending on the climate, sufficient insulation keeps the indoor temperature higher than the outdoor temperature with little or no heating. For example, in southern California, during winter heating is not necessary in Los Angeles and San Diego if the insulation is sufficient to take into account the colder night temperatures. Also, buildings include thermal mass such as concrete, that is able to store energy of the sun absorbed in daytime. Thus, even if the heating degree days indicate a demand for heating sufficient insulation of a building can make heating unnecessary.\n\nHDD provides a simple metric for quantifying the amount of heating that buildings in a particular location need over a certain period (e.g. a particular month or year). In conjunction with the average U-value for a building they provide a means of roughly estimating the amount of energy required to heat the building over that period.\n\nOne HDD means that the temperature conditions outside the building were equivalent to being below a defined threshold comfort temperature inside the building by one degree for one day. Thus heat has to be provided inside the building to maintain thermal comfort.\n\nSay we are given the number of heating degree days \"D\" in one year and we wish to calculate the energy required by a building. We know that heat needs to be provided at the rate at which it is being lost to the environment. This can be calculated as the sum of the heat losses per degree of each element of the buildings' thermal envelope (such as windows, walls, and roof) or as the average U-value of the building multiplied by the area of the thermal envelope of the building, or quoted directly for the whole building. This gives the buildings' specific heat loss rate \"P\", generally given in watts per kelvin (W/K). Total energy in kilowatt hours (kW⋅h) is then given by:\n\nAs total energy consumption is in kilowatt hours and heating degree days are [no. days×degrees] we must convert watts per kelvin into kilowatt hours per degree per day by dividing by 1000 (to convert watts to kilowatts), and multiplying by 24 hours in a day (1 kW = 1 kW⋅h/h). Since a 1 °C temperature change and a 1 K change in absolute temperature are the same, these cancel and no conversion is required.\n\nExample: For a typical New York City winter day with high of 40 °F and low of 30 °F, the average temperature is likely to be around 35 °F. For such a day we can approximate the HDD as (65 − 35) = 30. A month of thirty similar days might accumulate 900 HDD. A year (including summer average temperatures above 70 °F) might accumulate an annual 5000 HDD.\n\nCalculations using HDD have several problems. Heat requirements are not linear with temperature, and heavily insulated buildings have a lower \"balance point\". The amount of heating and cooling required depends on several factors besides outdoor temperature: How well insulated a particular building is, the amount of solar radiation reaching the interior of a house, the number of electrical appliances running (e.g. computers raise their surrounding temperature) the amount of wind outside, and what temperature the occupants find comfortable. Another important factor is the amount of relative humidity indoors; this is important in determining how comfortable an individual will be. Other variables such as precipitation, cloud cover, heat index, building albedo, and snow cover can also alter a building's thermal response.\n\nAnother problem with HDD is that care needs to be taken if they are to be used to compare climates internationally, because of the different baseline temperatures used as standard in different countries and the use of the Fahrenheit scale in the US and the Celsius scale almost everywhere else. This is further compounded by the use of different approximation methods in different countries.\n\nTo convert °F HDD to °C HDD:\n\nTo convert °C HDD to °F HDD:\n\nNote that, because HDD are relative to a base temperature (as opposed to being relative to zero), it is incorrect to add or subtract 32 when converting degree days from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.\n\n\n\n"}

The hall is Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England, and its landscaped park and formal gardens are also Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nThe formal gardens cover and form part of the estate (7.7 square miles). They feature a yew hedge maze, one of the finest in Britain, created by William Andrews Nesfield in 1846, and a ridge and furrow greenhouse designed by Joseph Paxton, the architect of The Crystal Palace. There is also a walled garden, an aviary, a loggia and a long pergola, covered with roses and wisteria. The more informal areas of the garden feature rhododendrons and azaleas and a fine collection of specimen trees.\n\nThe kitchen garden and the stable court are both listed Grade II*. The ridge and furrow glasshouses north of the kitchen garden are listed Grade II.\n\nSeveral pieces of garden ornaments and statuary are listed at Somerleyton Hall; these include the statue of Atlanta, the group of four urns around the sundial, as well as the sundial, all are listed Grade II. In the formal gardens, the four urns in the centre and the four stone troughs are both listed Grade II.\n\nThe remains of the Winter Garden and the boundary walling to the formal gardens are listed Grade II. The cistern at the south of the terrace to and the retaining wall to the garden front are listed Grade II. The screen wall to entrance front of the hall is Grade II listed.\n\nThe South Lodge and the gates to Somerleyton Hall are listed Grade II.\n\nIn 1240 a manor house was built on the site of Somerleyton Hall by Sir Peter Fitzosbert, whose daughter married into the Jernegan family. The male line of the Fitzosberts ended, and the Jernegans held the estate until 1604.\n\nIn 1604 John Wentworth bought the estate. He transformed Somerleyton Hall into a typical East Anglian Tudor-Jacobean mansion. It then passed to the Garney family.\n\nThe next owner was Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, a native of Lowestoft. He took part in the Battle of Lowestoft (1665) and the Battle of Solebay at Southwold in 1672. Eventually, the male line of that family also died out.\n\nIn 1843 Somerleyton Hall and Park were bought by the prosperous entrepreneur and MP Samuel Morton Peto. For the next seven years he carried out extensive rebuilding, creating an Anglo-Italian architecture masterpiece. Paintings were specially commissioned for the house, and the gardens and grounds were completely redesigned. Peto employed Prince Albert's architect John Thomas; the clock tower houses a clock designed by Benjamin Vulliamy. Peto had garden features designed by William Andrews Nesfield and Joseph Paxton. Peto's son, Harold Peto, became a noted garden-designer, but it is not known whether he was influenced by the gardens of Somerlyton. \n\nIn 1863 the Somerleyton estate was sold to Sir Francis Crossley of Halifax, West Yorkshire, a carpet manufacturer, who, like Peto, was a philanthropist and a Member of Parliament. Sir Francis' son Savile was created Baron Somerleyton in 1916.\n\nThe lake at Somerleyton Hall was used by Christopher Cockerell, the inventor of the hovercraft, to carry out his early experiments.\n\nThe house is now held by Hugh Crossley, 4th Baron Somerleyton and inhabited by the family. The family motto is 'Everything that is good comes from above'. In 1998 Lord and Lady Somerleyton commissioned the English artist Jonathan Myles-Lea, a specialist in country houses, gardens and estates, to paint Somerleyton Hall.\n\nThe house and its grounds featured as the principal location in \"Neck\", the sixth episode in the first series of \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (1976), and in episode 2 of the 1989 UK TV series, Interceptor.\n\nThe house and grounds feature prominently in W. G. Sebald's 1995 novel \"The Rings of Saturn\".\n\nThe house and grounds were used to stand in for Sandringham House in Stephen Poliakoff's 2003 television drama \"The Lost Prince\".\n\n"}

She was professionally active from 1980 to 1990, 2000 to 2001 and is active again from 2007 to present.\n\nKowalchyk was born in Montreal, Quebec, and is of Ukrainian descent. \n\nLuba performed with the band Zorya, which released a self-titled album in 1973. In the 1980s she \nwas the vocalist for a band named \"Luba\", and in 1980 that band released the album \"Chain Reaction\".\nLuba later signed as a solo artist under that name. She released three more albums and two EPs. Two of her albums are certified platinum by the Canadian music industry (sales in excess of 100,000 units). She has nine top-40 hits on the Canadian pop charts. Her signature song is \"Every time I See Your Picture\" (1983). Her most successful song is a cover of Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" which reached No. 6 on the Canadian pop chart and No. 3 on the Canadian adult contemporary chart (1987). \n\nLuba is a three-time winner of the Canadian music industry Juno Award for Female Vocalist of the Year (1985–1987). Her success is limited to her native Canada as she has never charted in the US or elsewhere. In addition to her Juno Awards, Luba has also received CASBY and Félix Awards, and a Black Music Association Award for \"Female Entertainer of the Year\". Most recently, her music has been featured on \"Canadian Idol\". She continues to record music under her own independent label.\n\nLuba Kowalchyk was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1958 to Ukrainian immigrant parents. Growing up she studied piano, guitar, flute and voice. During her teens she traveled across Canada to perform traditional Ukrainian folk songs at weddings and festivals.\n\nIn the 70s, then known as Lubomyra Kowalchyk, Luba released her debut LP with a musical ensemble \"Via Zorya\". The LP (Виа Зоря – \"...Любомира\") was released by the label Yeshvan and featured traditional Ukrainian folk songs in new arrangements. It Two years later, Luba released her first full-length solo LP, called \"Lubomyra\" via SAGE Promotions. It featured again Ukrainian folk songs, but this time mixed with elements of jazz, blues and rock. Both Ukrainian LPs featured her future drummer Peter Marunzak. With significantly higher production values than the typical standard Ukrainian music albums of the time, Luba's landmark Ukrainian recordings raised the bar for this music genre in the diaspora, setting the gold standard that was subsequently met by Kvitka Cisyk and Darka & Slavko. Luba released a single in French in 1979 called \"Le Doux Rendez-vous\" with the Label Bobinason. A year before the release of \"Le Doux Rendez-vous, she formed a band under her first name \"Luba\". Their debut album \"Chain Reaction\" was released on an independent label in 1980 and received only minimal interest outside of their native Montreal.\n\nLuba enjoyed her greatest success in Canada between 1983 and 1987. Capitol-EMI of Canada signed Luba Kowalchyk as a solo artist under the one name moniker \"Luba\" in 1982. A self-titled EP followed in late 1982 and the top 40 hit \"Every time I See Your Picture\" in early 1983. In 1984 Luba released her first full-length album called \"Secrets and Sins\". It issued the singles \"Let It Go\" and \"Storm Before The Calm\" both reaching the Canadian top-40 charts. Luba earned her first Canadian music industry Juno Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1985. Later the same year, she recorded several songs written by Stephen Lunt, Jon Stroll and Kevin Gillis for the first season of the Canadian cartoon series The Raccoons. Several of these songs were later re-recorded by Lisa Lougheed for use in later seasons. Two of Luba's songs are featured on the 1986 movie soundtrack 9 Weeks starring Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke: \"Let It Go\" from her Secrets and Sins album and one not previously released by Luba, \"The Best is Yet to Come.\" In 1986, Luba released \"Between the Earth & Sky\", which included the single \"How Many (Rivers To Cross)\". This top 20 Canadian hit had represented Canada at the 1985 World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan and made the finals. Also in 1986, Luba won her second straight Juno as Canada's best female vocalist. Shortly after the album release, Luba's band was involved in a serious bus accident, although Luba herself was not on board the bus at the time. Luba and her band took some time off, returning in 1987 with \"Over 60 Minutes With Luba\", a compilation of her hits with one new track, a live recording of \"When A Man Loves A Woman\". This track would become her biggest Canadian hit, peaking at No. 6 on the RPM top 100. She would cap the year with her third straight \"Best Female Vocalist\" Juno.\n\nBy 1988 Luba's music was being played mainly in Canada, Her label brought in new management to promote her work in the United States. Her next album, \"All Or Nothing\", was recorded over a year and half across 7 studios using various session musicians. Released in the fall of 1989, the album included the singles \"Giving Away A Miracle,\" \"No More Words\", and \"Little Salvation\". The band recorded an acoustic, live-in-the-studio show in Toronto and released as \"Live on Tour\" in 1990. \"All Or Nothing\" appeared on the RPM Top 100 chart that year and reached platinum status in Canada. With few sales in the US, her label then dropped her before the end of the year.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Luba experienced both professional and personal problems that resulted in her withdrawing from the music industry. In 1990, her marriage to band drummer and manager Peter Marunzak ended in divorce. Following her release from Capitol Records, she struggled to land a contract with another major record label. Her grandmother and then her mother both died while her sister, and lone relative left in Canada, developed multiple sclerosis that required intensive care. Finally, Luba felt she was missing out on a \"regular\" life from years of long hours in the music industry. Altogether, Luba decided to put her career on hold and focus on other priorities. Luba's most notable performance during the 1990s was as the featured halftime performer at the 1991 Grey Cup game in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nThe latest album by Luba, \"From the Bitter to the Sweet\", was released in 2000 on her own label Azure Music. While the album won some critical acclaim, and produced the Top 30 single \"Is She A Lot Like Me?\", it did not match the sales or radio airplay as her earlier albums. At year's end, she was featured in a concert performance on a Canadian program entitled \"An Evening with the Stars\", which included both new and old material.\n\nTwo new songs by Luba have recently appeared on a member music page of the popular social networking site MySpace. One is a ballad called \"Heaven,\" and the other more upbeat called \"Time.\" These are possibly singles for an upcoming album release, which is mentioned on both this Luba MySpace page and Luba's official website. An 18 April 2007 update on Luba's official website states that Luba chose to use MySpace to connect with her fans as well as for posting her music. Additional information is included on there, as well as a link to her MySpace page. Both new singles are available for adding to other MySpace members' music profiles.\n\nLuba has recently moved from Canada as of mid-2007 and now lives in Anguilla. She is still very focused on her passion, writing and singing, and is working on a new album which will highlight her roots in soul/R&B music. As well, she is pursuing another passion in the way of photography. Her work has already garnered tremendous critical acclaim, due to her distinct compositional style and innovative approach. Luba is also closely involved with animal causes, working with various animal shelters in providing service dogs to people suffering from physical and psychological trauma.\n\nOn 18 February 2014, a new compilation album called \"ICON\" was released by Universal Music Canada. The album contains remastered versions of hits from her albums \"Secrets and Sins\", \"Between the Earth & Sky\", \"All or Nothing\" and \"From the Bitter to the Sweet\", as well as a new track, \"Heaven\", which was previously previewed on Luba's MySpace page in 2007. In August she performed her first live concert in 14 years, at the Fierté Montréal festival.\n\nLuba remains one of the more successful female artists in Canadian music history despite never charting in the US. Her three consecutive Juno awards for Female Vocalist of the Year puts her in select company: only Anne Murray (9) and Celine Dion (6) have more.\n\nAs a singer, Luba has released seven full-length studio albums (two of which in Ukrainian, one studio EP, one live EP, two compilation albums and multiple singles. Music of hers has been featured on the cartoon series \"The Raccoons\" as well as on movies, most notably \"9½ Weeks\" (1986) and \"Keeping Track\" (1987).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Described in several traditions and texts, he describes his native roots in his book \"Bogar 7000\". Bogar went from Tamil Nadu to China and taught about enlightenment, this is also mentioned in his book Bogar 7000. Bogar is said to be in \"Nirvikalpa Samadhi\" below the sanctum sanctorum of Palani Murugan hill temple.\n\nThe Tamraparniyan sea route was adopted by Bogar in his travels from South India to China via Sri Lanka (ancient Tamraparni). A disciple of Agastya's teachings, Bogar himself taught meditation, alchemy, yantric designs and Kriya yoga at the Kataragama Murugan shrine, inscribing a yantric geometric design etched onto a metallic plate and installing it at the sanctum sanctorum of the Kataragama complex. Bogar is one of the earliest pilgrims to have traversed the Murugan Tiruppadai of Sri Lanka. According to legends and the temple scriptures of Palani temple, Bogar created the idol of Murugan at the hill temple in Palani by mixing nine poisonous herbs (Navapashanam) using a unique procedure. He also established the temple for Murugan in Poombarai Kuzhanthai Velappar temple Kodaikanal Tamilnadu, India. There is an extant statue of lord Murugan in Navapashanam. The milk that was poured on this statue has been said to have mixed with some of the herbs thereby proving to be an effective cure for the diseases during the time The priests of Palani Murugan temple were said to have been the descendants of Pulipani, one of Bogar's students, until the sixteenth century.\n\nAccording to siddha medicine documents, Bogar was the discoverer of an elixir of immortality. The \"Pharmacognosy\" is the best known of his treatises. His other works are on yoga and archery, and a glossary of medicine.\nHe came to Palani after finishing a meditation in the Meru hills in Kumari kandam. He lived for more than a Yuga.\n"}

With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.\n\nForest certification programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:\n\nBasic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:\n\nToday there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).\n\nThe PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.\n\nThird-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between environmental NGOs, forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including Jared Diamond, have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the American Tree Farm System (ATFS), the Canadian Standards Association’s Sustainable Forest Management Standard and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC, program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].\n\nThe National Association of State Foresters in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports \"all\" of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.\n\nThe Canadian Council of Forest Ministers issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” \n\nChain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.\n\nThe United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).\n\nForest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program. Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.\n\nThird-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.\n\nThe 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:\n\nThe World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867895", "title": "Multispectral image", "text": "Multispectral image\n\nA multispectral image is one that captures image data within specific wavelength ranges across the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths may be separated by filters or detected via the use of instruments that are sensitive to particular wavelengths, including light from frequencies beyond the visible light range, i.e. infrared and ultra-violet. Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its visible receptors for red, green and blue. It was originally developed for military target identification and reconnaissance. Early space-based imaging platforms incorporated multispectral imaging technology to map details of the Earth related to coastal boundaries, vegetation, and landforms. Multispectral imaging has also found use in document and painting analysis.\n\nMultispectral imaging measures light in a small number (typically 3 to 15) of spectral bands. Hyperspectral imaging is a special case of spectral imaging where often hundreds of contiguous spectral bands are available.\n\nMultispectral imaging measures light emission and is often used in detecting or tracking military targets. In 2003, researchers at the United States Army Research Laboratory and the Federal Laboratory Collaborative Technology Alliance reported a dual band multispectral imaging focal plane array (FPA). This FPA allowed researchers to look at two infrared (IR) planes at the same time. Because mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long wave infrared (LWIR) technologies measure radiation inherent to the object and require no external light source, they also are referred to as thermal imaging methods.\n\nThe brightness of the image produced by a thermal imager depends on the objects emissivity and temperature.  Every material has an infrared signature that aids in the identification of the object. These signatures are less pronounced in hyperspectral systems (which image in many more bands than multispectral systems) and when exposed to wind and, more dramatically, to rain. Sometimes the surface of the target may reflect infrared energy. This reflection may misconstrue the true reading of the objects’ inherent radiation. Imaging systems that use MWIR technology function better with solar reflections on the target's surface and produce more definitive images of hot objects, such as engines, compared to LWIR technology. However, LWIR operates better in hazy environments like smoke or fog because less scattering occurs in the longer wavelengths. Researchers claim that dual-band technologies combine these advantages to provide more information from an image, particularly in the realm of target tracking.\n\nFor nighttime target detection, thermal imaging outperformed single-band multispectral imaging. Citation. Dual band MWIR and LWIR technology resulted in better visualization during the nighttime than MWIR alone. Citation Citation. The US Army reports that its dual band LWIR/MWIR FPA demonstrated better visualizing of tactical vehicles than MWIR alone after tracking them through both day and night.  \n\nBy analyzing the emissivity of ground surfaces, multispectral imaging can detect the presence of underground missiles. Surface and sub-surface soil possess different physical and chemical properties that appear in spectral analysis. Disturbed soil has increased emissivity in the wavelength range of 8.5 to 9.5 micrometers while demonstrating no change in wavelengths greater than 10 micrometers. The US Army Research Laboratory's dual MWIR/LWIR FPA used \"red\" and \"blue\" detectors to search for areas with enhanced emissivity. The red detector acts as a backdrop, verifying realms of undisturbed soil areas, as it is sensitive to the 10.4 micrometer wavelength. The blue detector is sensitive to wavelengths of 9.3 micrometers. If the intensity of the blue image changes when scanning, that region is likely disturbed\".\" The scientists reported that fusing these two images increased detection capabilities.\n\nIntercepting an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in its boost phase requires imaging of the hard body as well as the rocket plumes. MWIR presents a strong signal from highly heated objects including rocket plumes, while LWIR produces emissions from the missile's body material. The US Army Research Laboratory reported that with their dual-band MWIR/LWIR technology, tracking of the Atlas 5 Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles, similar in design to ICBMs, picked up both the missile body and plumage.\n\nMost radiometers for remote sensing (RS) acquire multispectral images. Dividing the spectrum into many bands, multispectral is the opposite of panchromatic, which records only the total intensity of radiation falling on each pixel. Usually, Earth observation satellites have three or more radiometers. Each acquires one digital image (in remote sensing, called a 'scene') in a small spectral band. The bands are grouped into wavelength regions based on the origin of the light and the interests of the researchers.\n\nModern weather satellites produce imagery in a variety of spectra. \n\nIn the case of Landsat satellites, several different band designations have been used, with as many as 11 bands (Landsat 8) comprising a multispectral image.\nSpectral imaging with a higher radiometric resolution\n(involving hundreds or thousands of bands), finer spectral resolution (involving smaller bands), or wider spectral coverage may be called hyperspectral or ultraspectral.\n\nThe technology has also assisted in the interpretation of ancient papyri, such as those found at Herculaneum, by imaging the fragments in the infrared range (1000 nm). Often, the text on the documents appears to the naked eye as black ink on black paper. At 1000 nm, the difference in how paper and ink reflect infrared light makes the text clearly readable. It has also been used to image the Archimedes palimpsest by imaging the parchment leaves in bandwidths from 365–870 nm, and then using advanced digital image processing techniques to reveal the undertext with Archimedes' work. Multispectral imaging has been used in a Mellon Foundation project at Yale University to compare inks in medieval English manuscripts.\n\nMultispectral imaging can be employed for investigation of paintings and other works of art. The painting is irradiated by ultraviolet, visible and infrared rays and the reflected radiation is recorded in a camera sensitive in this regions of the spectrum. The image can also be registered using the transmitted instead of reflected radiation. In special cases the painting can be irradiated by UV, VIS or IR rays and the fluorescence of pigments or varnishes can be registered.\n\nMultispectral imaging has also been used to examine discolorations and stains on old books and manuscripts. Comparing the \"spectral fingerprint\" of a stain to the characteristics of known chemical substances can make it possible to identify the stain. This technique has been used to examine medical and alchemical texts, seeking hints about the activities of early chemists and the possible chemical substances they may have used in their experiments. Like a cook spilling flour or vinegar on a cookbook, an early chemist might have left tangible evidence on the pages of the ingredients used to make medicines.\n\nThe wavelengths are approximate; exact values depend on the particular satellite's instruments:\n\nFor different purposes, different combinations of spectral bands can be used. They are usually represented with red, green, and blue channels. Mapping of bands to colors depends on the purpose of the image and the personal preferences of the analysts. Thermal infrared is often omitted from consideration due to poor spatial resolution, except for special purposes.\nMany other combinations are in use. NIR is often shown as red, causing vegetation-covered areas to appear red.\n\nUnlike other Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation work, these multispectral images do not make it easy to identify directly the feature type by visual inspection. Hence the remote sensing data has to be classified first, followed by processing by various data enhancement techniques so as to help the user to understand the features that are present in the image.\n\nSuch classification is a complex task which involves rigorous validation of the training samples depending on the classification algorithm used. The techniques can be grouped mainly into two types.\n\nSupervised classification makes use of training samples. Training samples are areas on the ground for which there is Ground truth, that is, what is there is known. The spectral signatures of the training areas are used to search for similar signatures in the remaining pixels of the image, and we will classify accordingly. This use of training samples for classification is called supervised classification. Expert knowledge is very important in this method since the selection of the training samples and a biased selection can badly affect the accuracy of classification. Popular techniques include the Maximum likelihood principle and Convolutional neural network. The Maximum likelihood principle calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a class (i.e. feature) and allots the pixel to its most probable class. Newer Convolutional neural network based methods account for both spatial proximity and entire spectra to determine the most likely class.\n\nIn case of unsupervised classification no prior knowledge is required for classifying the features of the image. The natural clustering or grouping of the pixel values, i.e. the gray levels of the pixels, are observed. Then a threshold is defined for adopting the number of classes in the image. The finer the threshold value, the more classes there will be. However, beyond a certain limit the same class will be represented in different classes in the sense that variation in the class is represented. After forming the clusters, ground truth validation is done to identify the class the image pixel belongs to. Thus in this unsupervised classification apriori information about the classes is not required. One of the popular methods in unsupervised classification is k-means clustering.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1950, he graduated with a degree in medicine, specializing in psychiatry. He was a pioneer of group psychotherapy in Czechoslovakia and was a professor of psychiatry at the University of Prague.\n\nNesvadba originally translated poetry from English and wrote several theatrical plays as a student in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Towards the end of the 1950s, he began writing science fiction short stories. Befitting his background, psychiatry was often a theme in his science fiction. His stories typically revolved around such issues as human weakness and divided personalities, with a tendency toward dark humor, irony and satire, as in \"Vampires, Ltd.\", in which a car runs on blood. In the 1970s, he began to move away from science fiction, which was likely inevitable, as his main interests diverged somewhat from Western views of the genre. From a commercial perspective, this did not work well.\n\nSome of his stories were made into movies, including \"Death of Tarzan\", \"The Half-wit of Xeenemunde\", \"Vampires, Ltd.\" and \"Tomorrow I'll Wake Up and Scald Myself with Tea\". In the last of these, which he himself scripted, Hitler and issues of causality cropped up. He also worked on several TV and radio serials.\n\nNesvadba's work directed satirical barbs at the communist government of Czechoslovakia, as he had little faith in the grandiose dreams of twentieth-century Communism. However, he agreed overall with Marxist analysis, a viewpoint he maintained even after the unraveling of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.\n\nNesvadba was registered as an agent of the Czech Communist secret police StB under the codename \"Autor\".\n\nJosef Nesvadba was married to Libuse Nesvadbová. He died in Prague on 26 April 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When he stopped playing, he was Ireland's third most-capped player (108) and the eighteenth most-capped international player in rugby union history. During his career, O'Connell captained Munster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions. He is now a rugby pundit and commentator for BBC Sport.\n\nO'Connell was born in Limerick, Ireland to Mick and Sheila O'Connell. He attended the Model School and Ardscoil Rís, Limerick where he initially excelled at swimming and only started playing rugby at the age of 16, playing for the school in the Munster Schools Senior Cup and representing Irish Schools in 1997–98 along with international teammate Gordon D'Arcy. He also played five consecutive games with the Ireland U21s with Donncha O'Callaghan as his second row partner. O'Connell completed 3 out of 4 years of a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Limerick, before deferring the remainder of the degree to concentrate on rugby.\n\nO'Connell made his debut for Munster on 17 August 2001, in a Celtic League fixture against Edinburgh. His Heineken Cup debut for the club came in a home fixture against Castres Olympique which Munster won 28-23. He started for Munster in their 2002 Heineken Cup Final defeat to Leicester Tigers on 25 May 2002.\n\nO'Connell made his debut for Ireland against Wales in the 2002 Six Nations Championship, starting alongside Mick Galwey and scoring a try. Despite scoring this try, O'Connell has no recollection of the first half, recalling: \"I scored a try but I don't remember it. I went to tackle Craig Quinnell and he knocked me clean unconscious with his elbow. I played on for another 25 minutes, scored a try and then, eventually, with seven minutes left in the first half, I came around. I didn't really know what was going on and so I walked off the pitch.\"\n\nO'Connell was part of the Munster squad that won the 2003 Celtic League, beating Neath 37–17 in the final.\n\nHe scored two tries in a 35-12 victory over Wales in a World Cup warm-up game against Wales in August 2003 and was rewarded with a place on the Ireland squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He played against Romania, Namibia, Argentina and Australia in the pool stage, and the 43–21 quarter-final defeat to France.\n\nIn Ireland's opening game of the 2004 Six Nations Championship, O'Connell captained the side in the absence of Brian O'Driscoll. He also played in the game against Scotland on 27 March 2004, in which Ireland won their first Triple Crown for 19 years. O'Connell also gained silverware on the club front when Munster won the last ever final of the Celtic Cup, defeating Llanelli Scarlets 27–16 in Lansdowne Road on May 14, 2005. He was also part of the Ireland team that won a Triple Crown in the 2006 Six Nations Championship, playing in a dramatic 24-28 victory over England to clinch the Crown. He scored the last ever International try at the Old Lansdowne Road before it was demolished and rebuilt as the Aviva Stadium, in a 61-17 victory over the Pacific Islanders.\n\nO'Connell was selected in the squad for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. He won his first Test cap for the Lions on 25 June 2005, starting in the first test defeat to New Zealand. O'Connell also started the second and third tests.\n\nO'Connell was shortlisted for the International Rugby Board player of the year in 2006, and was the only Northern Hemisphere nominee. The other four nominees were Dan Carter, Richie McCaw, Chris Latham and Fourie du Preez, with McCaw being named the eventual winner.\n\nO'Connell was an integral member of the Munster team that won the 2005–06 Heineken Cup, scoring a try in the 19-10 quarter-final victory over USA Perpignan and playing a crucial role in defeating Leinster 30-6 in the semi-final and Biarritz Olympique 19–23 in the 2006 Heineken Cup Final.\n\nO'Connell again took over from an injured O'Driscoll as Ireland captain in their historic match against France in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, the first rugby match ever played at Croke Park.

His campaign started against Namibia, who, despite being the lowest ranked team in the competition, only lost 32-17 to Ireland. After the game, O'Connell admitted: \"A few of the more experienced guys need to start performing better and start leading the team a bit more.\" O'Connell lined out for another disappointing Irish performance six days later when Georgia came embarrassingly close to beating Ireland, eventually only losing 14-10. O'Connell's world cup ended after Ireland recorded two defeats against France and Argentina, meaning Ireland crashed out in the pool stage of the tournament in one of the lowest points in Irish rugby history.\n\nO'Connell became Munster captain in July 2007, succeeding Anthony Foley. He led Munster to their second Heineken Cup triumph in the 2007–08 season, playing a crucial role in the lead up to Munster's sole try in their 16–13 defeat of Toulouse in the 2008 Heineken Cup Final. He also led the side to victory in the 2008–09 Celtic League.\n\nO'Connell's ability to steal Welsh line-out ball was a key role in Ireland's 17-15 victory over Wales which granted Ireland the 2009 Six Nations Championship and a first Grand Slam in 61 years. He played in all of Ireland's 2009 November Test matches, with Ireland claiming a draw against Australia, and two wins over Fiji and South Africa.\n\nOn 21 April 2009, O'Connell was named as the British and Irish Lions Captain for the 2009 tour to South Africa. He commented at the time: \"I looked at the squad last night and it will be a privilege to lead them. It's a great honour considering the captains that have gone before me, some of them legends of the game.\" He started the first test defeat alongside Alun Wyn Jones on 20 June 2009. He led the Lions in the second test with a new second-row partner in the form Simon Shaw as the Lions lost the match and with it, the series. O'Connell started in the last test of the series where the Lions managed a consolation victory to avoid the first whitewash by South Africa in 118 years.\n\nO'Connell missed Ireland's first two matches of the 2010 Six Nations Championship due to a hip injury, but returned to play England, Wales and Scotland. He missed Ireland's 2010 Summer Tests due to a groin injury that became infected, and also missed the 2010 Autumn Tests.\n\nAfter being out through injury for nine months, O'Connell made his comeback for Munster against Cardiff Blues in December 2010. He made his Heineken Cup comeback against Ospreys a week later, only to be sent off and banned for four weeks. His return was not enough to stop Munster losing 32-16 to Toulon in a result that meant Munster failed to advance past the pool stages of the competition for the first time in 13 years.\n\nO'Connell was selected in Ireland's 2011 Six Nations Championship squad, playing against Italy, France, Scotland, Wales and England.

He made his comeback from the knee injury suffered in the 2012 Six Nations against Ulster in the Heineken Cup quarter-final on 8 April 2012. O'Connell suffered another knee injury in Munster's Pro12 league game against Ulster, which ruled him out for 4–6 weeks and made him a doubt for Ireland's 3-Test series against New Zealand in June 2012. Having missed the series, O'Connell declared himself fit in August 2012. He also stood down as Munster squad captain, making way for teammate Doug Howlett on 24 August 2012, having been captain for just over five years.

During Pac-Man's training, Pac-Master's family went to the Power Pellet Harvest Festival with Pac-Man. The Ghosts (possibly young too) decided to summon the legendary ghost, Golvis. He was said to be so strong that he was sent to space by the ghosts themselves. Castle Pac were celebrating the large crop of power pellets gathered, when the Harvest Festival was suddenly disturbed by a UFO from which Golvis comes. In an attempt to save the Pacs, Pac-Master chomped on a power pellet. But while the other ghosts turned blue, Golvis remained his normal colour with only the end of his tail blue. Golvis and his alive guitar sidekick (named Jack) turned the Pac-People into spheres (they are the same just without arms or legs), and kidnaps them all. With the help of Pac-Land's guardian fairy, Krystal, Pac-Man managed to escape before getting kidnapped. This explains why Golvis' guitar is always out of tune because he was using it to smash Pac-Man into the ground.\n\nNow with the help of Krystal, Pac-Man (who has been put on Golvis' sphere curse) must save Pac-Master's family from the evil Golvis and Ghosts, with their evil plot to turn Pac-Land into Ghost-Land.\n\n\n\nThe game received mixed to positive reviews.\n\n\"Pac 'n Roll\" was re-released on to the Wii in 2007 as part of \"Namco Museum Remix\"; it is renamed \"Pac 'n Roll Remix\" and instead of the controls using the touch screen, it uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. The story is also removed from this version of the game and the DS version's \"Ghost House\" world is replaced with a Wii-exclusive \"Golvis's Hideout\" world. The Wii version's final boss is also different from the DS version's final boss. This version also doesn't include the \"Pac-Moon\" or the original \"Pac-Man\" within it since this version is already part of an arcade compilation. In North America, this version was also re-released again in 2010 as part of \"Namco Museum Megamix\", also for Wii.\n\n"}
