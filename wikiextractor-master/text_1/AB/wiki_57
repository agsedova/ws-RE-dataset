{"id": "1986599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986599", "title": "University High School (Los Angeles)", "text": "University High School (Los Angeles)\n\nUniversity High School Charter, commonly known as \"Uni\", is a public secondary school, built 1923-1924, and founded 1924, located in West Los Angeles, a district in Los Angeles, California, near the border with Santa Monica. University High is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The campus also holds Indian Springs Continuation High School. The school contains the Serra Springs, a sacred site of the Tongva–Gabrieleño native people and a registered California Historical Landmark.\n\nWhile under construction it was known as Sawtelle High School, but it opened as Warren G. Harding High School when completed in 1924, after 29th President Warren G. Harding (1865-1923, served 1921-1923), who had recently died. The school was renamed in 1929 after the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) moved its campus from East Hollywood to Westwood, and the reputation of former President Harding had declined after the infamous Teapot Dome scandal and other situations. The name \"University\" is supposed to have originated because it became a site where teachers-in-training from nearby UCLA worked as assistant teachers/interns.\n\nThe original administration building was designed by the firm Russell & Alpaugh and the construction process began in 1923. The style which was chosen recalls the Romanesque of Northern Italy and Spanish Mission style architecture. The administration building once displayed an octagonal tower and a portico, but these features were toppled in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. An original cafeteria building was located where the current cafeteria and theater stand today. Although the gymnasium and a beautiful and widely admired auditorium were condemned following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the school's original main building from 1924 remains in use. The music building and gym (rebuilt in the early 1980s) have been scheduled to be taken down because they sit on a fault line and therefore against district policy. As of July 2010, the music building is gone.\n\nMusic classes have been moved to another unused room near the top of the school. The gym was still in use while, on the south end of the campus, in what was formerly a student parking lot, a new gym facility was under construction in 2010. The current football stadium, last rebuilt following the 1994 Northridge earthquake, is named in honor of Jackie Robinson (1919-1972), of Pasadena, California, the first African American professional baseball player in Major League Baseball, playing in 1947-1956 for the Brooklyn Dodgers, who also previously attended nearby UCLA, 1939-1940. \n\nUni is one of a very few pre-World War II high schools in Los Angeles whose buildings have been at least partially spared by three major earthquakes since its inception. The main building presents a very traditional and dignified appearance, with weathered brick and arched doorways, such that the campus is popular with film crews (see #Filming on campus). One-third of its class of 1942 did not graduate because of the internment of Japanese-Americans.\n\nIn fall 2007, some neighborhoods zoned to have their students to attend Hamilton High School were rezoned to University High School.\n\nIn 2009, Mitchell Landsberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that the school was \"struggling to regain its reputation as a center of excellence\". That year, as part of a grant program, the Academy of Engineering was established at the high school.\n\nFor the entire 88-year history of University High, the football/baseball field had been without stadium lights until they were installed in the Spring of 2012.\n\nLocated on Uni's campus are the Serra Springs, California Historical Landmark #522. The springs, called \"Kuruvungna\" by the native Gabrieleno Tongva people, were used as a source of natural fresh water by the Tongva people since 400 , and they continue to produce 22,000-25,000 gallons of water a day. The springs are found at two separate locations on campus. The larger is now closed off from the rest of the campus and is under the care of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation. Prior to its being fenced off, the area surrounding the springs and pond into which its waters feed was popular among the students as a place to meet and relax. The other spring is located on the northeastern edge of the so-called Girls' Field. A third spring was located farther north, near Texas Avenue, but it ceased to flow during the 1940s when a local water company began drawing from the aquifer.\n\nThe Portolá Expedition of 1769, one of the two expeditions that led to the founding of Los Angeles, camped at the Kuruvunga village while travelling along the route that would become known as El Camino Real. The name Serra comes from Father Junípero Serra the founder of the Alta California mission chain, who is reported to have said Mass to there. In the 1800s, the spring served as the water supply for the city of Santa Monica.\n\nConstruction at the school in 1925 unearthed evidence of a Native America village, and in 1975, a grave was discovered from what archaeologists now believe to be a burial site.\n\nIn 1980, Indian Springs Continuation High School, which is housed on the part of the campus where the springs are, was opened. \n\nIn 1992, tribal descendants, community members, and teachers and students from the school founded the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation, a non-profit foundation, to fight a proposed development a block north of the springs that would have cut off the springs' underground water source. They successfully fought the proposed parking structure, and since that time, the Foundation has been active at the springs.\n\nThat same year, the newly established Foundation held the first annual Life Before Columbus Day event. The event, which takes place just before Columbus Day every year and celebrates the history of the land and of the Tongva people, has been known to draw upward of 600 people some years, including Native Americans from various tribes, local politicians, community members, and students and faculty from the school. \n\nThe event includes tours of the Kuruvunga Village site and springs, performances by dancers from the Tongva and Aztec tribe, and storytelling from the Chumash tribe. There are also hands-on activities offered by authentic Native American vendors. The foundation currently leases the site from the Los Angeles Unified School District for their monthly ceremony and guided tours.\n\nThe weekly student newspaper, the \"Wildcat\", is part of the High School National Ad Network. Print issues from the school's inception as Harding High are available in the journalism archives. More recent issues were previously archived online at the \"My High School Journalism\" site operated by the American Society of Newspaper Editors\n\n\"The Worrier\" was an underground student newspaper that began in 1966. At least seven \"Worrier\" staff members were transferred to other high schools, suspended or put on probation.\n\nThe \"Red Tide\" was an underground campus newspaper. Its first issue appeared in November 1971. Following the suspension of two students for distributing \"Red Tide\" #2, 500-700 Uni students occupied the administration building.\n\nThe \"Red Tide\" challenged the Warrior mascot as racist. Twenty-five years later, on September 8, 1997, the LAUSD Board of Education voted to remove the mascot as part of a ban on using Native American symbols. In 1995 LA and Bay Area \"Red Tide\" branches moved to Detroit, where they organized campaigns to free Gary Tyler and other campaigns against racism.\n\nThe school's mascot was formerly the Warrior, but was changed after the Southern California Indian Center petitioned the LAUSD to eliminate the mascots and names of all schools that had American Indian mascot and names. In 1997 the LAUSD decided to eliminate all American Indian mascots. The LAUSD decision was upheld in federal court, but the California Racial Mascots Act, a bill which would eliminate American Indian mascots and names statewide, was vetoed by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger twice.\n\nTowards the end of the 1997–1998 school year, students were allowed to vote on a new school mascot. Students chose the \"Wildcats\" over the \"Gators\" and \"Jaguars\". The Class of 1985 had, as a senior project and gift to the school, painted a large Warrior mascot on the south entrance to the gym building. Shortly after the mascot change, this was painted over with its feline animal replacement.\n\n\nAccording to the School Information Branch:\n\nNeighborhoods served by University High are parts of West Los Angeles, including portions of Brentwood Beverly Hills Post Office (BHPO), Westwood, Bel-Air, and the Wilshire Corridor.\n\nLike other Westside high schools such as Westchester and Palisades, University High School enrolls a diverse mix of students from its enrollment area and various parts of the city; on top of Westside neighborhoods, Uni draws students from areas such as Koreatown and South Los Angeles. The school also enrolls many Capacity Adjustment Program students which come from areas zoned to heavily overcrowded high schools.\n\nTwo new LAUSD high schools opened in fall 2005, four more in fall 2006, and one more in fall 2007, decreasing the number of transfer students in other high schools.\n\nStarting in the 2018-2019, University became and affiliated charter school and changed its name to University High School Charter. Affiliated charter schools receive flexibility in the utilization of the charter school categorical block grant (for those applicable affiliated charter schools that receive it) areas of curriculum and professional development; some aspects of local school governance; and some aspects of employee selection. It is not necessary to utilize the District’s permit process if accepted to an Affiliated Charter School. It is a community school that welcomes students from all over Los Angeles. However, non-resident students are required to complete this Unified Enrollment application.  \n\nUnderground water from the Kuruvungna springs sustains seven mature Indian Laurel Ficus trees on the campus which line a walkway between the classroom building and one of the two teachers' parking lots. In September 2002, LAUSD Area D announced that it would remove the seven ficus trees lining the outside of the classroom building, because the roots had grown into and were pushing up the concrete in the parking lot causing a potential hazard.\n\nIn response to the removal announcement a campaign was launched to stop the removal of the trees. Notably, a student petition got 1,200 signatures (about half of the student population), and community involvement came from the city of Santa Monica and from the neighborhood councils of Brentwood and West Los Angeles.\n\nIn response to the public outcry, the LAUSD held meetings to determine what would happen to the trees. Walter Warriner, the Arborist of the city of Santa Monica proposed installing Rubbersidewalks by Rubbersidewalks, Inc., which could be easily lifted in order to prune the tree roots for maintenance. After months of negotiations, the LAUSD decided not to remove the trees and agreed to install Rubbersidewalks, making University High School the first high school in the United States to use Rubbersidewalks in order to preserve its trees. Installation for the Rubbersidewalks started on November 20, 2003, over a year after the LAUSD had originally condemned the trees.Installation of the Rubbersidewalks was covered by Huell Howser for California's Gold. The episode covering Uni High's Rubbersidewalks aired on KCET on January 28, 2004. Rubber asphalt was also used to repave the pushed up concrete in the teachers' parking lot.\n\nThe school, which has been able to maintain much of its original architecture, is one of the few Los Angeles schools with buildings constructed before World War II. Its brick facades, wide hallways, and \"unique east coast look\" make the school an attractive place to film. The administration, which allows filming during school hours, moves classes as needed and allows productions to make minor changes to the campus, has a long history of bringing in filming (and the money that goes with it) to the school.\n\nThe use of the school for filming is a controversial one. Filming often takes place during school hours, and students and teachers are moved from classrooms and walkways are blocked off as needed. The school often undergoes renovations for filming, anything from retiling and painting, to temporary removal of furniture and lockers. These disruptions are a cause for students and teacher complaints.\n\nPast articles in the \"Wildcat\" addressed not only the disruption to students, but how the money made from the constant filming is spent. Editorials have complained about the portion of the money that goes to the LAUSD, and the way the money is spent by the school.\n\nUniversity High charges the standard district fee for each day of filming (currently $2,500). A portion of the money earned goes to FilmL.A., Inc., formerly named the Entertainment Industry Development Corporation, which acts as an intermediary between the LAUSD and the entertainment industry. The name change, which followed the naming of a new president and finance chief and came as the company was preparing to relocate its headquarters and implement a revised contract with the Los Angeles City Council, helped distance the private non-profit from its \"bureaucratic and scandal-ridden image.\" \n\nIn March 2005, the LAUSD entered into a new three-year contract with the EIDC, aftering soliciting bids from other vendors. Ruben Rojas, the LAUSD's director of revenue enhancement, said that the district choose to continue working with the EIDC because of \"its proven track record and ability to deal with complex film-permitting issues.\". Indeed, during that time, FilmL.A. expanded the number of schools that had hosted on-location filming from 19 schools to more than 200 schools: coordinating 1,500 film shoots at 250 LAUSD sites. The LAUSD's filming profits for the 2003-2004 school year generated almost one million dollars, and the district is on target to for an annual film revenue increase to at least $1.5 million. \n\nThe doubling of the LAUSD's film revenue in the four years since FilmL.A. was original hired in March 2002 was a contributing factor to Burbank Unified School District's decision to hire Film L.A. in July 2006.\n\nUnder FilmL.A.'s current contract with the city, the company receives \"a 16% management fee based on the total use fee\". 75 percent of the remaining filming monies go to the individual schools that host the on-location shooting to be used at the school's discretion, and 25 percent goes to a district fund that benefits schools that do not generate film revenues of their own. \n\nUni High distributes among the departments the first $12,000 made each year from on-campus filming. The Budget Committee makes spending recommendations for any additional monies. Recent budget cuts have made filming at schools more attractive. In 2004, the number of schools volunteering to be film locations grew from 19 to 160 and the district's annual film revenue doubled to $1 million. In 2005,\nLAUSD officials revised the district's fee structure for the first time since 1992. The revision included extending a full day of shooting from 14 to 15 hours, and a daily rate increase from $1,700 to $2,500.\n\nUni has been noted in the press as being one of the more popular schools for filming, even compared to other local schools with similar structure and appearance. In a two-year period ending in 2003, 38 movies, TV shows and commercials were filmed at University High. This popularity, with both its positive and negative impacts, is credited to the Assistant Principal who is responsible for the filming on campus.\n\nIn November 2006, \"Drillbit Taylor\", starring Owen Wilson began filming at Uni. As of April 2007, the $90,000 received for this production is the most that the school has made on an individual filming contract. Uni underwent massive renovations in order to prepare for the filming of \"Drillbit Taylor\". The interior and exterior of the main building were painted, and the main building was retiled as well. The facade of the building was altered to read \"McKinley High School\", and plants and grass patches were added throughout the school. \n\nThese changes were unusual not only because the extent and timing of the changes meant that construction took place during the school year, but also because \"Drillbit Taylor\" production did not pay for the re-tiling. The district had provided money to re-tile floors throughout the LAUSD, so the re-tiling of the floors itself was not unusual or controversial. However, as the film's production needs guided the color choices for the re-tiling and the schedule for construction, many students were upset by the behavior of the movie company and the school.\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of productions that have filmed at University High:\n\n\n\n\n\nList of University High School (Los Angeles) alumni\n\n"}

{"id": "1986639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986639", "title": "Languages of Azerbaijan", "text": "Languages of Azerbaijan\n\nAlthough there are several languages native to the territory, Azerbaijani is the official language and the medium of communication of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe primary and official language of Azerbaijan is Azerbaijani, Azeri, a Turkic language closely related to and partially mutually intelligible with Modern Turkish. Together with Turkish, Turkmen and Gagauz, Azerbaijani is a member of Oghuz branch of southwestern group Turkic language family. Although Azerbaijani is used in the Republic of Azerbaijan, South Russia (Dagestan) and Northern Iran, the dialects are different. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is recognized as an official medium of instruction in Dagestan and in the Republic of Azerbaijan, however, it is not an official language in Northern Iran where the number of Azerbaijanis exceed the ones in the Republic of Azerbaijan itself. The Azerbaijani language spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan is quite different than the one spoken in North Azerbaijan and instead of promoting the use of language, the Iranian government has discouraged and even banned it for several decades.\n\nAccording to the 2009 census of the country it is spoken as a native language by 92.5% of the population whereas Russian and English play significant roles as languages of education and communication. More than half of Azerbaijani speakers are monolingual. The large Armenian-speaking population of Nagorno-Karabakh is no longer under government control. Lezgian, Talysh, Avar, Georgian, Budukh, Juhuri, Khinalug, Kryts, Jek, Rutul, Tsakhur, Tat, and Udi are all spoken by minorities.\nAll these (with the exception of Armenian, Lezgian, Talysh, Avar, and Georgian, which have much larger number of speakers outside Azerbaijan, but nevertheless are steadily declining within Azerbaijan) above-mentioned languages are endangered languages which are threatened with extinction, as they are spoken by few (less than 10,000) or very few (less than 1,000) people and their usage is steadily declining with emigration and modernisation.\n\nAccording to 2019 research English language proficiency in Azerbaijan was lowest among surveyed European countries.\n\nAn entire issue of the \"International Journal of the Sociology of Language\", edited by Jala Garibova, was devoted to the matter of languages and language choices in Azerbaijan, vol. 198 in 2009.\n\nAzerbaijan has not ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages to which it became signatory in 1992, under the Popular Front. In 2001, the then President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev issued a statement whereby \"the Republic of Azerbaijan is not in the power to guarantee the implementation of the Charter regulations until its territory occupied by the Republic of Armenia is liberated\".\n\nThe medieval author Ibn al-Nadim, in his book \"Al-Fihrist\" mentions that all the Median and Persian lands of antiquity (including what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan) spoke one language. There, he quotes the great scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa:\n\nHe then reports that Dari is the official language of the royal courts, and is from Khorasan and Balkh and eastern Iran; Parsi is the language of the Zoroastrian Moobeds, and is from Fars; Khuzi is the unofficial language of royalty and is from Khuzestan; and Seryani originates from Mesopotamia.\n\nThis has also been reported by reputed medieval historians such as Al-Tabari, Ibn Hawqal, Istakhri, Moqaddasi, Yaghubi, Masudi, and Mostowfi Qazvini as well. Al-Khwarizmi also mentions this in Chapter 6, Vol. 6, of his book \"Mafatih-ol-Olum\".\n\nEtymological studies also further indicate that current dialects spoken from Baku through Khalkhal to Semnan, all originated from a common source. In other words, the people of ancient Azerbaijan spoke the same language spoken by the Medes. (See Columbia University's distinguished professor Ehsan Yarshater's report in: \"Majjaleh-ye Daaneshkadehye Adabiyaat\", 5, No 1–2, p35-37)\n\nThe medieval historian Yaqut al-Hamawi also used the phrase \"Al-ajam-ol-Azariyah\" (\"The Azeri Iranian\") in his books \"Mo'ajjem ol-Odabaa\" and \"Mo'jem ol Baladaan\". In other sources such as \"Surat-ol-Arz\" by Ebne Hoghel, \"Ahsan ol-Taqaaseem\" by Moqaddasi, and \"Masaalik va Mamaalik\" by Istakhri, the people of Azerbaijan are recorded as having spoken Iranian languages. Obviously, this was before the Turkic cultural arrival. And Tabari in 235 A.H. also mentions that poets in Maragheh recited poetry in Pahlavi. Some Azerbaijani poets however, such as Qatran Tabrizi (d465 A.H.), used the word \"Persian\" and \"Pahlavi\" interchangeably to describe their native language.\n\nThe historian Hamdollah Mostowfi even goes as far as describing variants of \"Pahlavi\" spoken in different areas of Azerbaijan. In his book \"Tarikh Gozideh\", he describes eight poets from Azerbaijan, calling them \"Ahl-ol She'r Men-al-Ajam\" (Iranian poets), all Persian=speaking. By now, of course, Dari and Pahlavi had merged into one, as successive dynasties moved from east to west, bringing with them the Dari version of the Iranian language.\n\nSuffice it to say that the number of records and documents from Azerbaijan in the Pahlavi language are so numerous that there is little doubt that this was indeed the native tongue of Azerbaijan before the arrival of the Turks. Many words in the current Azeri vocabulary are in fact of Pahlavi origin. (See studies in \"Nashriyeh Adabiyaat\" of Tabriz University, by Dr Mahyar Navabi, 5, 6. Also see \"Farhang e Kamaleddin Teflisi\" and \"Ajayeb ol-Makhluqaat\" by \"Najibeddin Hamadani\", and the books \"Majmal-ol-Tavarikh wa al-qasas\" and \"Iskandar-Nameh e Qadeem\" for lists of words.)\n\nIt is agreed that the current Turkic form of the Azeri language supplanted and replaced Pahlavi in Azerbaijan before the Safavid dynasty, perhaps starting with the arrival of Seljukian Turks, and following a gradual course. But some historians report Pahlavi being spoken in Tabriz as late as the 17th century. (See \"Rowdhat ul-Jinan\" by Hafez Hosein Tabrizi (d997 A.H.), and \"Risaleh ye Anarjani\" written in 985 AH). Even the Ottoman Turkish explorer Evliya Celebi (1611-1682), mentions this in his Seyahatname. He also reports that the elite and learned people of Nakhichevan and Maragheh spoke Pahlavi, during his tours of the region.\n\nThe first appearance of the use of Azerbaijani is closely connected with the first appearance of Turkish tribes in the early first millennium. With the settlement of Turkish tribes not only the economy but also culture and language used for communication were influenced by them. The evolvement of the Azerbaijani language as a means of communication has come a long way covering centuries. Just studying Kitabi-Dede Gorgud (\"Kitabi-Dede Korkut, The Book of Dede Korkut\") is enough to say Azerbaijani has at least 1300 years of history as a medium of communication in the territory of now the Republic of Azerbaijan, Eastern Turkey, Southeastern Georgia, Northwestern Iran, Eastern Armenia and Southern Russia. Some sources point out that the written literary examples of the use of language date back to the 13th century. The Azerbaijani language has had two main periods of development - the ancient period covering 13th to 18th centuries, and the present day period starting from about the late 18th century and lasts up to the present day.\n\nThe ancient period covers not only the main development stage of the language but also covers renaissance literature of Azerbaijan. During the ancient period, the government and the army were ruled by the Safavids, Aggoyunlus, Qaraqoyunlus, and Djelairids which overlaps with the high literary development period of the territory and the country and the use of the language is characterized by extra-linguistic properties.\n\nAzerbaijani has been influenced by many cultures throughout the history due to being occupied by different countries. The firmest and the longest of these external influences are Persian, Arabic, Russian. Owing to being occupied and settled by the above-mentioned countries, the Azerbaijani language has also been used in harmony with their languages, allowing it to borrow an excessive number of words from their culture and in return lend words as well. This could be the reason why, regardless of being independent for almost three decades, the influence of other languages is still remarkably strong, especially after being 70 years under Soviet occupation, Russian language is still widely used in the country.\n\n\n\n"}

In December 2001, the renamed World Championship was unified with the WWF Championship to create the Undisputed WWF Championship.\n\nThe championship was generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. There have been a total of 22 recognized champions who have had a combined 62 official reigns, with Ric Flair holding the most at seven (the actual total is eight, but WWE does not recognize the title being vacated after the 1994 Spring Stampede match, although WCW did recognize this). At 51, Flair was also the oldest champion when he won it in May 2000, while The Giant was the youngest when he won it in October 1995 at 23. The longest reigning champion was Hulk Hogan, who held the title for 469 days, which is the only reign to exceed one year (365 days). The shortest reigning champion was Chris Jericho, who held the title for approximately 13 and a half minutes, since he unified with the title with the WWF Championship at Vengeance.\n\n\n"}

The former State Normal School building now serves as the Eugene Brucker Education Center, the central office for the San Diego Unified School District.\n\nAt the time of the founding of San Diego, the area that is now Normal Heights was largely covered with brush and populated only by rabbits. Later it had a few farms, but development was limited by lack of water. Speculators became interested in the area during the San Diego land boom of the 1880s, and several land development companies were actively working in the area by the 1900s. Around 1905 a reservoir was built in University Heights; partly, as a result, the number of buildings in Normal Heights increased from one in January 1906 to 43 in December of the same year. The community was officially founded in 1906, when a syndicate led by D. C. Collier and George M. Hawley filed a subdivision map with the county. At that time it was an independent community, not part of the city of San Diego. It became one of San Diego's first \"streetcar suburbs\" with the development of an electric trolley route along Adams Avenue, part of the San Diego Electric Railway system. A trolley barn was built in Normal Heights in 1913; the Adams Avenue Operating Division was established in 1915.\n\nA group of residents organized the Normal Heights Improvement Association in 1911, establishing a county public library and other improvements. Normal Heights Central School was established in 1912. The county began paving the roads and establishing gutters and sidewalks in 1913. A commercial business district developed in the 1920s, centered on Adams Avenue between 37th Street (now Felton Street) and 38th Street (now 34th Street); the area is now considered a potential historic district, referred to as the Carteri Center after local resident Benjamin J. Carteri, who spurred business and residential development in the 1920s. The community was annexed to the city of San Diego in 1925.\n\nIn June 1985 a wildfire burned into Normal Heights from the Mission Valley slope just north of the community. The blaze damaged or destroyed \"expensive bluff-top buildings with views of the valley and Mission Bay\" as well as \"modest bungalows built when the Normal Heights community was first started in 1906.\" The fire destroyed 69 homes. Later that year Normal Heights was a finalist for the title of All America City; the designation was based in part on neighborhood support for the victims of the fire, as well as a neighborhood campaign for a city park and density-decreasing community plan.\n\nNormal Heights is centrally located in the city of San Diego, on a mesa just south of Mission Valley. Its borders are defined by Interstate 805 to the west, Interstate 8 to the north, State Route 15 to the east, and El Cajon Boulevard to the south.\n\nA notable building in the community is a bungalow court on Adams Avenue designed by Louis L. Gill, originally named El Sueño and now known as Santa Rosa Court. Another is a Carmelite monastery on Hawley Blvd. designed by Frank L. Hope, Sr.\n\nA 2001 study found the neighborhood to have a median age of 31 and an ethnic breakdown of 53% white, 25% Hispanic, 13% African American, and 9% Asian American. Normal Heights was reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune to be the only neighborhood to perfectly reflect the ethnic diversity of San Diego.\n\nLike other urban mesa neighborhoods north of Balboa Park, Normal Heights has a high rate of pedestrian activity. The stretch of Adams Avenue between Texas Street on the west and Ohio Street on the east is sometimes referred to as Antique Row, due to its numerous antique stores. A landmark neon sign over Adams Avenue at Felton Street identifies the neighborhood.\n\nSeveral important neighborhood events take place in Normal Heights. The Adams Avenue Street Fair, Southern California's largest free music festival, is typically held the last weekend in September. Adams Avenue Unplugged, formerly the Adams Avenue Roots Festival, another free music festival, is held the last weekend of April. Another large Art Around Adams is a local community art event where unique and talented artists showcase their work inside and outside businesses and spaces along Adams Avenue.\n\nThe Normal Heights Community Planning Group (NHCPG) advises the city on neighborhood land-use issues, particularly local historical properties, zoning, traffic-calming, and neighborhood facilities such as parks and libraries. The Normal Heights Recreation Council advises the city on local park and recreation issue. The Adams Avenue Business Association operates the local business improvement district and sponsors major local festivals. Other community groups include the Normal Heights Community Association, the Normal Heights Cultural Council, the Normal Heights Community Development Corp., and the Friends of Normal Heights Canyons.\n\nThe community contains three public elementary schools, Adams Elementary School and Normal Heights Elementary School, run by the San Diego Unified School District, and the public charter school San Diego Global Vision Academy. The neighborhood also houses St. Didacus Catholic School.\n\nNormal Heights is a Mid-City Community and is part of City Council District 3, currently represented by Chris Ward. The area is covered under the City of San Diego's Mid-City Communities Plan and is a part of the Mid-City Public Facilities Financing Plan.\n\n"}

J-Wave airs mostly music, covering a wide range of formats. The station is considered the most popular among FM broadcasts in Tokyo, and has surprised the radio broadcast industry by gaining a higher popularity rate than an AM station (JOQR) in a survey conducted in June 2008. J-Wave was founded in October 1988 with the callsign of JOAV-FM. It is a member station of the Japan FM League (JFL) commercial radio network.\n\nJ-WAVE's slogan is \"The Best Music on the Planet.\" The DJs are known as . The music format can be considered a Japanese equivalent of the Western concept of Top 40 or CHR radio.\n\nHundreds of different jingles separate programs from commercials; they are generally played at the same decibel level and are variations on a single melody. J-Wave has been broadcast via satellite since 1994 and some of its programs also air on some community radio stations in Japan.\n\nOn December 10, 1987, J-WAVE was incorporated and started test broadcasts on the FM band at 81.3 MHz on August 1, 1988. On October 1 of that year at 5:00 a.m., it started transmission from Tokyo Tower. J-Wave was the 27th FM radio station nationwide to launch at that time, and the second in Tokyo. The name”J-WAVE” originally derived from a record shop WAVE in Roppongi, which also belonged to \"Saison Group\". While other radio stations focused more on presentation, J-WAVE adopted a \"more music less talk\" format. The station had a large fanbase because of its unusual programming style, playing music non-stop except for jingles and breaks for news, traffic and weather. The law in Japan at that time stipulated that programming had to be maximum 80% music, and minimum 20% talk and continuity. J-WAVE coined the term \"J-pop\", which is only vaguely defined. However, as the years went by, the station lost influence. Sponsor after sponsor pulled their ads because of the growing irrelevance of the programming to what they were selling.\n\nAround 1995, J-WAVE hired new personalities in an attempt to rejuvenate itself. Its term \"J-POP\" became synonymous with commercially palatable Japanese music from across the spectrum, except for traditional Japanese music. Specials started to air around this time, and the station took steps to attract a listener base desirable for higher ad revenues.\nThe format J-WAVE introduced to Japan, \"more music less talk\" almost disappeared during reorganization in early 1997, when DJ banter became more pronounced.\n\nOn October 1, 2003, J-WAVE moved its head office to the 33rd floor of the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower in Minato, Tokyo.\nOn April 23, 2012, J-WAVE moved its transmitting station at Tokyo Tower to the Tokyo Sky Tree with new transmission power of 7 kilowatts with an ERP of 57 kilowatts. Before the move, the transmission power was 10 kilowatts with an ERP of 44 kilowatts.\n\nToday, J-WAVE has changed dramatically since its first broadcast. The station acquired a solid listener base who were less interested in a pretense of social rebellion. Nonetheless, J-Wave has never hit the No. 1 rank in ratings in the last ten years in the Tokyo region.\n\nJ-WAVE has set up its own airplay charts, which tallies the songs were played the most during that week on its own station. Note: These should not be confused with the Japanese single charts, Oricon, which has its own national airplay charts.\n\nThere is also a TV version shown on MTV Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

He also had a solo/side thrash metal project in tribute to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Austrian Death Machine, in which he performed all the instruments. He also formed a death metal band called Pyrithion and played guitar for Society's Finest and Point of Recognition.\n\nLambesis was a judge for the 8th and 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.\n\nLambesis was arrested in 2013 after attempting to hire an undercover police officer to murder his wife. He pleaded guilty in 2014 and was sentenced to serve six years in prison. Lambesis was released on parole in December 2016.\n\nSince his release, he has reunited the band As I Lay Dying with his former members and released an album: \"Shaped by Fire\".\n\nLambesis grew up in Southern California and was voted \"Most Like Jesus\" by classmates when he attended Santa Fe Christian School in Solana Beach, California as a teen. He attended Liberty University for a time and majored in Religious Studies.\n\nLambesis is a bodybuilder and started his own YouTube fitness channel. He is also heavily tattooed. His tattoos include a \"rocking Jesus,\" and cyborg Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Koi fish swimming upstream, which represents a quest for meaning and fulfillment, Hebrew writing, a cross, Jesus Christ in clouds, and his largest (completely covering his back), a samurai fighting a tiger, which represents the battle between reason and instinct.\n\nLambesis married Meggan Murphy in June 2004. They have two daughters and a son all adopted from Ethiopia.\nLambesis has previously stated on multiple occasions that he is a Christian. During an August 2010 radio interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis said \"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and his resurrection come across in our lyrics.\" He was described as a \"follower of Jesus\" once more.\n\nStarting in 2012, Lambesis has made several statements indicating a change in his religious beliefs: in a post on his personal Tumblr page explaining some of the lyrics from the AILD album \"Awakened\" (released September 2012), Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\". While he noted that he \"didn't hate all religious belief\" and was \"still inspired by the words of [Jesus]\", he was finding it \"very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with\", and was increasingly regarding \"the god of tradition and ritual that I grew up with as less and less of a probable truth\". He also quoted the book \"Pagan Christianity\" by George Barna and Frank Viola, noting that both \"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\".\n\nIn August 2012, Lambesis sent an email to his wife, Meggan Murphy-Lambesis, while on tour with AILD in which he stated he no longer loved her, had engaged in an extramarital affair, and \"no longer believed in God\". They separated the same month. She filed papers in San Diego Superior Court one month later in September 2012 seeking a dissolution of their marriage, according to an online court database. In divorce papers, Meggan stated that Lambesis was obsessed with bodybuilding, spending \"endless hours at the gym\", and was wasting \"thousands of dollars on tattoos\". She also alleged that he had become \"dangerously distracted\" while watching their children, including falling asleep while they played in their pool, and had taken two last-minute trips to Florida to see an extramarital girlfriend.\nWhen not on tour, Lambesis lived in Del Mar, California. Murphy and their children live in Encinitas.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, Lambesis was arrested in Oceanside, California, for attempting to hire a hitman to murder his estranged wife Meggan Murphy, and, according to the San Diego Sheriff's Department, was charged with soliciting \"an undercover detective to kill his wife.\" Lambesis approached someone at a gym and asked if he knew anyone who would kill his wife. Lambesis met with the undercover agent posing as a hitman, code name \"Red\", according to Deputy District Attorney Claudia Grasso. \"Red\" asked Lambesis if he wanted his wife of eight years gone, and Lambesis replied, \"Yes, that's what I want.\" He then gave [the] undercover agent an envelope containing US$1,000 for expenses, pictures of his wife, her address, the code to get through a gate, and the date on which to kill her. Lambesis had directed the detective he believed to be a hitman to kill his wife while he was with his children so he would have an alibi. He agreed to pay $20,000 for the hit.\n\nOn May 9, 2013, Lambesis pled not guilty to a felony charge of solicitation of murder and was ordered held on $3 million bail despite prosecutors deeming Lambesis a \"flight risk\" and \"danger to the public\". Lambesis' bandmates, representatives from management and Metal Blade Records, and band attorney Ian Friedman were in attendance at his arraignment. According to the District Attorney of the case, an audio recording of the transaction between Lambesis and the undercover detective exists and was reportedly used at the trial. A readiness conference was set for June 10, 2013, and a preliminary court date was scheduled for July 10, 2013. During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded \"not guilty\" and his lawyer stated: \"His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use.\" A new bail hearing was held for Lambesis on May 17, 2013, at which defense attorney Tom Warwick had bail reduced from $3 million to $2 million. Lambesis was released on bail on May 30. Lambesis was ordered to wear a GPS monitor, was subject to strict travel restrictions, and was unable to see or communicate with his wife and three children. As a result, As I Lay Dying's mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage was cancelled.\n\nOn February 25, 2014, Lambesis changed his plea from \"not guilty\" to \"guilty\" and was sentenced to six years in prison on May 16, 2014 and credited with 48 days for time served.\n\nWhile on house-arrest, Lambesis made a lengthy post on his personal blog in which he stated that (due to the ongoing criminal case) he was unable to \"explain more about my case or to explicitly state what my current worldview is\", but noted that \"after my incarceration, I found myself re-evaluating topics that I had previously sworn I would never waste my time looking at again.\" Lambesis stated that \"I grew up in a Christian home and held that belief myself for many years. In the process of sincerely trying to defend that belief in a scholarly way and shortly after finishing my degree, I felt that it was unreasonable to call myself a Christian in light of the evidence. Many AILD fans picked up on the not-so-subtle hints at my worldview change in a couple songs on \"Awakened\". It was never really hidden.\" In June 2014, Lambesis came out as an atheist, claiming that he, along with other members of the band, just kept pretending to be Christian just to sell records, a claim called slanderous and defamatory by another member of the band. He even recalls feeling awkward when asked for their testimonies and when fans ask to pray with them. According to Lambesis, his renunciation of Christianity made it easier to have an affair. However, since his arrest the band has released a statement that Lambesis \"has spent much of the last year re-evaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God, or whatever you want to call it,\" adding, \"That's for him to talk about when he's comfortable and only time will tell if he is sincere.\"\n\nIn 2016, after two years in prison, Lambesis filed a lawsuit against two Southern California detention centers for gross negligence in denying his request for anastrozole, a drug he'd been prescribed to fight the side effects of withdrawal from steroids. The lawsuit alleges that as a result of the failure to provide him with the drug, Lambesis developed breasts and underwent severe emotional distress. His request for punitive damages of $35 million was dismissed in September 2016, but his claims of medical negligence have yet to be tried.\n\nHe was released on parole on December 17, 2016. He eventually married Amanda Dubord, in April 2017.\n\nLambesis started his musical career while he was still in high school, playing bass in the first few bands he was in. He and Matt Carlson (drums) formed the band Against the Mark, where Lambesis would become the band's vocalist. The two would get a full band together, including Bassist Jon Jameson. The band changed their name to Life Once Lost, but only for a short time, until they entered an indefinite hiatus. Lambesis left in 2000 to join Society's Finest, but only for a brief time, as they did not have plans to tour. Lambesis returned to California to restart Life Once Lost, but with a whole new lineup. The band discovered A Life Once Lost, which caused the band to change their name to As I Lay Dying. Lambesis hired Jordan Mancino, former drummer of Edge of Mortality, and Evan White. In 2001, Lambesis and Mancino joined Point of Recognition and recorded on the album \"Day of Defeat\" in 2002. The two quit soon after to further pursue As I Lay Dying.\n\nOver the years, the band went through many lineup changes. Lambesis and Mancino were the only remaining original members and constant members until 2003, when 19-year-old guitarist Phil Sgrosso joined the band. The next year, in 2004, the band hired Nick Hipa as the band's lead guitarist. Hipa was playing previously with Evelynn, a band that was signed to Pluto Records, AILD's former label. Bassist Clint Norris was, most likely, the band's most consistent bassist until his departure in 2007 and the introduction of Josh Gilbert. The five of them recorded and released \"An Ocean Between Us\", including \"Nothing Left\", which was Grammy-nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\". In 2008, Lambesis and Destroy the Runner vocalist Chad Ackerman formed Austrian Death Machine, a parody metal band based around Arnold Schwarzenegger. The two recorded two releases, \"Total Brutal\" and \"A Very Brutal Christmas\" the same year. The next year saw the release of \"Double Brutal\".\n\nThe band wrote and recorded \"The Powerless Rise\", which was released in 2010 to much critical acclaim. In 2011, Austrian Death Machine released \"Jingle All the Way\". Lambesis would release three albums over the next three years; \"Awakened\" with AILD (2012), \"The Burden of Sorrow\" by Pyrithion, a side project with members of Allegaeon and The Famine (2013), and \"Triple Brutal\" with Austrian Death Machine (2014). In 2014, all of Lambesis' projects went on hiatus, due to his criminal acts.\n\nIn 2017, Lambesis resurrected As I Lay Dying, initially rumoured with all new members. After consolidation with the old members, the band reunited in form of the old lineup. On June 7, 2018, the band released a new single, \"My Own Grave\". On April 12, 2019, As I Lay Dying released another single, \"Redefined\", and on September 20, 2019, the band released their seventh studio album, \"Shaped by Fire\".\n\nwith As I Lay Dying\n\nas/with Austrian Death Machine\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986667", "title": "Words of Institution", "text": "Words of Institution\n\nThe Words of Institution (also called the Words of Consecration) are words echoing those of Jesus himself at his Last Supper that, when consecrating bread and wine, Christian Eucharistic liturgies include in a narrative of that event. Eucharistic scholars sometimes refer to them simply as the \"verba\" (Latin for \"words\").\n\nAlmost all existing ancient Christian Churches explicitly include the Words of Institution in their Eucharistic celebrations, and consider them necessary for the validity of the sacrament. This is the practice of the Latin Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and all the churches of Oriental Orthodoxy, including the Armenian, the Coptic, the Ethiopian and the Malankara, as well as the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Churches, Methodist Churches and Reformed Churches. The only ancient Mass ritual still in use that does not explicitly contain the Words of Institution is the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari, used for part of the year by the Assyrian and the Ancient Church of the East. The Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, two of the Eastern Catholic Churches, use the same Anaphora, but insert in it the Words of Institution. However, the Catholic Church has explicitly recognized the validity of this Mass ritual in its original form, without explicit mention of the Words of Institution, saying that \"the words of Eucharistic Institution are indeed present in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, not in a coherent narrative way and \"ad litteram\", but rather in a dispersed euchological way, that is, integrated in successive prayers of thanksgiving, praise and intercession.\"\n\nNo formula of Words of Institution in any liturgy is claimed to be an exact reproduction of words that Jesus used, presumably in the Aramaic language, at his Last Supper. The formulas generally combine words from the Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke and the Pauline account in . They may even insert other words, such as the phrase \"Mysterium fidei\", which for many centuries was found within the Roman Rite Words of Institution, until removed in 1970, and has a counterpart in the Syrian liturgy's τὸ μυστήριον τῆς καινῆς διαθήκης (\"the mystery of the new covenant\").\n\nThere is no consensus among scholars if the Words of Institution were used in the celebrations of the Eucharist during the first two or three centuries or if their use was only sporadic. In her study \"The Function of the Words of Institution in the Celebration of the Lord's Supper\" Ros Clarke refers to evidence that suggests that Words of Institution were not used in the celebration during the 2nd century. She says that the evidence from the early church suggests that the words of institution were not then used liturgically, but only catechetically, and so the narrative of the Last Supper was not used in celebrating the Eucharist. What was essential, she says, was the ritual, consisting of the four actions of taking bread, giving thanks, breaking it, and giving it to be eaten, accompanying the actions by saying some words identifying the bread with Jesus' body, and similarly with respect to the cup. Father Robert Taft states definitely that there is not a single extant pre-Nicene (325 AD) Eucharistic prayer that one can prove contained the Words of Institution.\n\nThe Words of Institution of the Roman Rite Mass are here presented in the official English translation of the Roman Missal in the form given in the following italicized text. The distinction here made by bolding is not found in the Missal.\n\nFrom the time of Peter Lombard on, the prevailing theology of the Catholic Church considered the eight words in bold above to be \"on their own\" the necessary and sufficient \"sacramental form\" of the Eucharist. Pope Eugene IV's Decree for the Armenians, issued after the Council of Florence, declared: \"The words of the Savior, by which He instituted this sacrament, are the form of this sacrament; for the priest speaking in the person of Christ effects this sacrament. For by the power of the very words the substance of the bread is changed into the body of Christ, and the substance of the wine into the blood\". The Decree did not limit the words to the eight in bold, but was popularly taken to mean that, on their own, they are all that is needed for effecting the sacrament. \n\nThe theological opinion about the necessity and sufficiency of pronouncing certain parts of the Words of Institution (the eight words bolded in the English translation given above) is not included in, for instance, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, published in definitive form in 1997. On 17 January 2001 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared that the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari, a probably second-century anaphora in which the Words of Institution are not spoken, \"can be considered valid.\" The Guidelines for Admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East issued by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in agreement with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches on 20 July 2001 say that \"the words of the institution of the Eucharist are in fact present in the anaphora of Addai and Mari, not in the form of a coherent narration and in a literal way but in a euchological and disseminated manner, that is to say they are integrated in the prayers of thanksgiving, praise and intercession which follow.\" These prayers in fact speak of \"the commemoration of the Body and Blood of your Christ, which we offer to you on the pure and holy altar, as you have taught us in his life-giving Gospel.\"\n\nIt has therefore been argued that it is the prayer as a whole, not some isolated words within it, that is efficacious in the sacrament, and that the Words of Institution that Jesus himself spoke at his Last Supper are consecratory at every Eucharist, whether they are repeated or only implied, in accordance with the teaching of Saint John Chrysostom: \"That saying, 'This is my body', once uttered, from that time to the present day, and even until Christ's coming, makes the sacrifice complete at every table in the churches.\"\n\nWhile thus accepting as valid the Anaphora of Addai and Mari even when the Words of Institution are not explicitly spoken, the document of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity \"warmly invites\" an Assyrian priest celebrating the Eucharist when Chaldean Christians are participating to insert the Words of Institution in that circumstance, as permitted by the Assyrian Church itself.\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the Words of Institution are the only portion of the Anaphora chanted aloud by the priest:\n\n\"For the bread\": \"Take, eat: this is My Body, which is broken for you for the remission of sins.\"\n\n\"For the wine\": \"Drink of it, all of you: this is My Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you and for many, for the remission of sins.\"\n\nOrthodox Christians and some Eastern Catholic Churches do not interpret the Words of Institution to be the moment the \"Gifts\" (sacramental bread and wine) are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ. In fact, they do not define a specific moment of change; however, they understand the process to be completed (perfected) at the Epiclesis (the calling-down of the Holy Spirit upon the Gifts).\n\nThe Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts does not contain the Words of Institution, since it is actually a Vespers service at which the faithful receive from the Reserved Mysteries (Sacrament) which were consecrated the Sunday before (hence the name: \"Pre-sanctified\").\n\nProtestant denominations generally, with the exception of the Anglican Communion and Lutheranism, rely exclusively on the words of St. Paul as recorded in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26. (\"ESV\"):\n\nProtestantism has typically utilized the words of institution as a central part of its Communion service, though precise traditions vary by denomination. The debate over the force and literalness of the words of institution underlies the arguments between a sacramental union, as with the Lutheran Churches, and a pneumatic presence, as with the Reformed Churches. Most of the established churches in the Protestant tradition employ a mirroring of Paul's words surrounding the words of institution, while Congregationalist and Baptist churches use the words themselves without the full citation of Paul's wording.\n\nThe following version of the Words of Institution is found in the Book of Common Prayer and is used among those in the Anglican Communion:\n\n\"\"For in the night in which he was betrayed, he took bread; and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is my Body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me. Likewise, after supper, he took the cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, \"Drink ye all of this; for this is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you, and for many, for the remission of sins. Do this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me.\"\"\n\nThe Lutheran liturgy differs from that of other Protestants by using a conflation of the four versions of the words of institution. Luther's Small Catechism shows this, \"\"Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when he was betrayed, took the bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples and said: Take; eat; this is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way he also took the cup after the supper, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them saying, Drink of it, all of you. This cup is the New Testament in my blood, shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"\"By doing so, they include the phrase \"My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins...\" This reflects Lutheran sacramental theology in which the sacrament is a means of grace and actively forgives sins.\n\nThe following version of the Words of Institution is found in the Book of Common Worship and is used among those in the Presbyterian Church USA:\nThe Lord Jesus, on the night of his arrest, took bread,\nand after giving thanks to God,\nhe broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying:\nTake, eat.\nThis is my body, given for you.\nDo this in remembrance of me.\nIn the same way he took the cup, saying:\nThis cup is the new covenant sealed in my blood,\nshed for you for the forgiveness of sins.\nWhenever you drink it,\ndo this in remembrance of me.\nEvery time you eat this bread and drink this cup\nyou proclaim the saving death of the risen Lord,\nuntil he comes.\n\nCurrent trends in Methodist thought would require both the \"verba\" and an epiclesis for a Prayer of Thanksgiving, which bridges Western and Eastern thought.\n\n \"Liturgy for Presbytery Celebrations of the Lord's Supper.https://www.pcusa.org/site_media/media/uploads/sharedcelebration/pdfs/liturgy.pdf\n\n\n \n"}

He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from to for the Pittsburgh Burghers (1890), Philadelphia Athletics (1891), Brooklyn Grooms/Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1892–1896), Cincinnati Reds (1897–1906) and the New York Giants (1907). The Connecticut native occasionally played second base later in his career. He batted and threw right-handed.\n\nBorn in New Haven, Connecticut, Corcoran gained the nicknames Corky and Tommy the Cork. He was considered a hard-working, supple-handed shortstop.\n\nA mediocre hitter, Corcoran batted .300 in a season just once (1894). He was a barehanded fielder early in his career when gloves were gradually becoming standard equipment, and made the transition to a glove without difficulty. He became adept at going to his right to field ground balls backhanded. Corcoran set a still-standing ML record for shortstops with 14 assists in a nine-inning game. (Lave Cross had 15 assists in a 12-inning game in 1897.) Corcoran finished in the top 10 in the league in at bats seven times.\n\nOver an 18-season career, Corcoran batted .256, with 34 home runs and 1,135 RBIs. He had a total of 387 stolen bases, scored 1,184 runs, and made 2,256 hits in 8,812 career at-bats. He accumulated 2,957 total bases.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Corcoran became an umpire; his umpiring included one season in the short-lived third major circuit, the Federal League.\n\nCorcoran had four sons and a daughter.

{"id": "1986671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986671", "title": "Project Reality", "text": "Project Reality\n\nProject Reality is a series of combined arms tactical first-person shooter video game modifications which aim to create a realistic combat environment where the core gameplay encourages teamwork and coordination. The original version, \"Project Reality: BF2\", was released in 2005 for \"Battlefield 2\", it is still being updated on a regular basis and became a stand-alone game in 2015.\n\n\"Project Reality\" for \"ARMA 2\" was released as a beta in 2011, development was later moved to \"ARMA 3\" in 2013. In September 2015 it was announced that the project had been suspended.\n\n\"Squad\", a commercial game built on Unreal Engine 4, is a spiritual sequel to \"Project Reality\".\n\n\"Project Reality\" features five game modes. Two of the most popular game modes are Advance and Secure (AAS) and Insurgency (INS). AAS involves capturing and holding control points, similar to the Conquest mode of Battlefield 2. In AAS, control points typically must be captured in a certain order with one team attacking, and one team defending. The second most popular game mode, Insurgency, is intended to simulate asymmetrical warfare. The Insurgency game mode involves a conventional forces team searching for and destroying hidden weapon caches while the other team, the insurgents, try to defend them. Moreover, the other game modes are Vehicle Warfare (VW) and Command and Control (CNC). The Vehicle Warfare mode differs by putting full emphasis on heavy vehicles and assets, and restricting the player to one kit role (crewman). The play style for Vehicle Warfare is otherwise identical to the Advance and Secure mode where players must capture objective points in order. Finally, the Command and Control mode removes all control points. The objective instead is focused around player built fortifications and their single Forward Operating Base. Players must build and defend their hidden Forward Operating Base while also searching for the opposing forces' base. The mod also features a co-op mode, where human players may play alongside or against computer controlled players. Co-op can also serve as a single-player mode (with bots standing in for teammates).\n\nIn contrast to the original system of Battlefield 2, players may not spawn at their squad leader when they die, but must instead spawn at permanent spawn points such as main bases, or at temporary rally points created by the squad leader. Players may also spawn at Forward Operating Bases which can be constructed if supply crates are delivered to the desired location. When constructed, other fixed defences such as stationary machine guns and various defensive constructs such as barbed wire or foxholes can be placed afterwards with the delivery of additional supplies.\n\nThe Insurgency game mode diverts slightly from these rules, limiting the insurgent side to spawn at their weapons caches which they must defend, or they lose the ability to spawn. The opposing team can discover the location of these caches by catching informants for the insurgents, after which an enemy cache will be marked on the conventional forces' map, indicating its position. However, insurgents can still deploy and construct destructible \"hideouts\" to spawn at, which act in a similar way to the Forward Operating Bases in conventional game modes. The conventional forces are also able to construct their own Forward Operating Bases for forward deployment.\n\nProject Reality features over 15 factions with more in development.\n\n\"Project Reality: ARMA 2\" exists as a standalone modification requiring both \"ARMA 2\" and \"\". It remains self-contained, self developing and does not rely on or use externally held add-ons from other sources where at all possible. What that means to the player is that it is a 'one stop shop' as an installation package, with no requirement for additional multiple add on packs.\n\nProject Reality: ARMA 2 v0.1 BETA was released on September 2 which was shortly followed by the release of Project Reality: ARMA 2 v0.15 beta on March 16, 2012. A year later on March 1, 2013 0.16 version was released including two new terrains (maps). With the release came the news of a cease in development with the ARMA2 mod and a movement of efforts towards \"ARMA 3\".\n\nIn early 2009 it was revealed through the official Project Reality forums that a standalone successor \"Project Reality 2\" is in pre-production. A license for the C4 Engine has been purchased as of 2010.\n\nAn entry for a game called \"\"Project Reality 2 - The Beaten Zone\"\" has been posted to the official Crytek developers community \"crytek.net\", stating that the game would be using the CryEngine 3. \"Project Reality\" staff have dismissed the supposed engine change as rumor, and did not acknowledge any connection to the \"crydev.net\" posting.\n\nHowever, new announcements from the Dev Team, made sure that PR2 will be in fact using the CryEngine 3, since most of the people involved in the development of the game on the C4 Engine thought it wasn't so good to work with, and they have chosen the CryEngine 3 as their new engine to work on. There is no set release date for the game. Since 2014 there has been no more word from the team behind the standalone. One of the main developers also mentioned that the game's production had stopped.\n\nOn October 10. 2014 a team consisting of current and former Project Reality:BF2 developers announced a new commercial game based on the Project Reality gameplay formula. The new game is named \"Squad\" and is built on Unreal Engine 4. The game, as of December 2015, is available on Steam Early Access. The game was initially funded through a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. \n\nMajor game review websites, IGN and GameSpy have both reviewed \"Project Reality\". IGN review states \"why all \"BF2\" players should download this mod.\" while GameSpy says that \"the mother of all realism mods [has] arrive[d] for BF2\". PC Zone Magazine also reviewed \"Project Reality\", saying that \"not only does it make the virtual warfare harsher, \"Project Reality\" also adds fantastic new maps, vehicles and weapons to the fray\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986672", "title": "Ferranti Pegasus", "text": "Ferranti Pegasus\n\nPegasus was an early British vacuum tube (valve) computer built by Ferranti, Ltd that pioneered design features to make life easier for both engineers and programmers. Originally it was named the Ferranti Package Computer as its hardware design followed that of the Elliott 401 with modular plug-in packages. Much of the development was the product of three men: W.S. (Bill) Elliott (Hardware); Christopher Strachey (Software) and Bernard Swann (Marketing and Customer Support). It was Ferranti's most popular valve computer with 38 being sold. The first Pegasus was delivered in 1956 and the last was delivered in 1959. Ferranti received funding for the development from the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC).\n\nAt least two Pegasus machines survive, one in The Science Museum, London and one in The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. The Pegasus in The Science Museum ran its first program in December 1959 and was regularly demonstrated until 2009 when it developed a severe electrical fault. In early 2014, the Science Museum decided to retire it permanently, effectively ending the life of one of the world's oldest working computers. The Pegasus officially held the title of the world's oldest computer until 2012, when the restoration of the Harwell computer was completed at the National Museum of Computing.\n\nIn those days it was common for it to be unclear whether a failure was due to the hardware or the program. As a consequence, Christopher Strachey of NRDC who was himself a brilliant programmer, recommended the following design objectives:\n\n\nThe first objective was only partially met: because both program and the data on which it was to operate had to be in the 128 words of primary storage contained in 8-word nickel delay lines. The rest of the memory was held on a 7936-word magnetic drum which rotated at 3750 rpm, so it was often necessary to use ingenuity to reduce the number of transfers between the fast store and the drum.\nPegasus had eight accumulators, seven of which could also be used as index registers, the first computer to allow this dual use. Accumulators 6 and 7 were known as p and q and were involved in multiply and divide and some double length shift instructions. Each word contained 39 bits plus one bit for parity checking. Two 19-bit instructions were packed into one word and the extra bit that could be used to indicate a breakpoint (optional stop), to assist in debugging. In line with Strachey's second objective, it had a relatively generous instruction set for a computer of its time, but there was no explicit hardware provision for handling either characters or floating point numbers.\n\nThe speed of arithmetic operations was about the same as the Elliott 402 computer, which could add in 204 microseconds and multiply in 3366 microseconds. The Pegasus basic instruction cycle time for add/subtract/move and logical instructions was 128 microseconds. Multiply, divide, justify and shift instructions took a variable time to complete. Transfers to and from the drum were synchronous. The layout of blocks on the drum was interleaved to allow some processing between transfers to/from consecutive blocks. The computer was advertised as weighing .\n\nTo what extent Strachey's third objective was reached, depends on how one views a price of £50,000 for Pegasus 1, which did not have magnetic tape drives, line printer or punched card input and output. The modular design with plug-in units of hardware did, however, make it very reliable by the standards of the day, and maintenance was \"a doddle of a job\".\n\nThe initial version of Pegasus, Pegasus 1 was intended for scientific and engineering applications. Its input was \"via\" 5-hole paper tape with output on tape. The variant for business data processing was called Pegasus 2 and could equipped with punched cards, magnetic tape and line printer.\n\nIn 1956 the first Pegasus was used to calculate the stresses and strains in the tail plane of the Saunders-Roe SR.53; the results were used to check the manufacturers figures; the programmer was Anne Robson. Because of the importance of a computer it was housed in the drawing room, complete with an Adam's ceiling, of Ferranti's London office in Portland Place.\n\nA Pegasus 1 was installed at Cyber House, Sheffield by Stafford Beer for the use of United Steel. It was the first computer installed for management cybernetics.\nThe Pegasus at Southampton University was used for analysis of ground resonance data for the Saro P.531 helicopter that eventually entered production as the Westland Scout and Westland Wasp.\n\nIn 1957 a Pegasus computer was used to calculate 7480 digits of pi, a record at the time. In 1959 Handley Page Ltd were advertising for experienced Pegasus programmers to join their aviation design team at Cricklewood, London \n\nThe University of Leeds had a Pegasus computer, run by Sandy Douglas. This was used, among other things, for a project to process the University's matriculation records.\n\nOther people who worked on the Pegasus included Hugh McGregor Ross and Donald B. Gillies.\n\n\n\n"}

CAATs is the practice of using computers to automate the IT audit processes. CAATs normally includes using basic office productivity software such as spreadsheet, word processors and text editing programs and more advanced software packages involving use statistical analysis and business intelligence tools. But also more dedicated specialized software are available (see below).\n\nCAATs have become synonymous with data analytics in the audit process.\n\nThe traditional method of auditing allows auditors to build conclusions based upon a limited sample of a population, rather than an examination of all available or a large sample of data.\n\nCAATTs, not CAATs, addresses these problems. CAATTs, as it is commonly used, is the practice of analyzing large volumes of data looking for anomalies. A well designed CAATTs audit will not be a sample, but rather a complete review of all transactions. Using CAATTs the auditor will extract every transaction the business unit performed during the period reviewed. The auditor will then test that data to determine if there are any problems in the data.\n\nAnother advantage of CAATTs is that it allows auditors to test for specific risks. For example, an insurance company may want to ensure that it doesn't pay any claims after a policy is terminated. Using traditional audit techniques this risk would be very difficult to test. The auditor would \"randomly select\" a \"statistically valid\" sample of claims (usually e if any of those claims were processed after a policy was terminated. Since the insurance company might process millions of claims the odds that any of those 30–50 \"randomly selected\" claims occurred after the policy was terminated is extremely unlikely.\n\nUsing CAATTs the auditor can select every claim that had a date of service after the policy termination date. The auditor then can determine if any claims were inappropriately paid. If they were, the auditor can then figure out why the controls to prevent this failed. In a real life audit, the CAATTs auditor noted that a number of claims had been paid after policies were terminated. Using CAATTs the auditor was able to identify every claim that was paid and the exact dollar amount incorrectly paid by the insurance company. Furthermore, the auditor was able to identify the reason why these claims were paid. The reason why they were paid was because the participant paid their premium. The insurance company, having received a payment, paid the claims. Then after paying the claim the participant's check bounced. When the check bounced, the participant's policy was retrospectively terminated, but the claim was still paid costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\n\nWhich looks better in an audit report:\n\n\"Audit reviewed 50 transactions and noted one transaction that was processed incorrectly\"\n\nor\n\n\"Audit used CAATTs and tested every transaction over the past year. We noted XXX exceptions wherein the company paid YYY dollars on terminated policies.\"\n\nHowever, the CAATTs driven review is limited only to the data saved on files in accordance with a systematic pattern. Much data is never documented this way. In addition saved data often contains deficiencies, is poorly classified, is not easy to get, and it might be hard to become convinced about its integrity. So, for the present CAATTs is complement to an auditor's tools and techniques. In certain audits CAATTs can't be used at all. But there are also audits which simply can't be made with due care and efficiently without CAATTs.\n\nIn the most general terms, CAATTs can refer to any computer program utilized to improve the audit process. Generally, however, it is used to refer to any data extraction and analysis software. This would include programs such as data analysis and extraction tools, spreadsheets (e.g. Excel), databases (e.g. Access), statistical analysis (e.g. SAS), generalized audit software (e.g. ACL, Arbutus, EAS), business intelligence (e.g. Crystal Reports and Business Objects), etc.\n\nBenefits of audit software include:\n\nAudit specialized software may perform the following functions:\n\n\nCAATs is the fundamental tool which is used by the auditors. This tool facilitates them to make search from the irregularities from the given data. With the help of this tool, the auditors and accountant of any firm will be able to provide more analytical results. These tools are used throughout every business environment and also in the industry sectors too. With the help of computer-assisted audit techniques, more forensic accounting with more analysis can be done. It’s really a helpful tool that helps the firm auditor to work in an efficient and productive manner. Working with the CAATs, it is essential for the accountant or the auditor to select the right data, the selection process is very much tricky, and you need to be professional for it. After selecting the right data, import that to the CAATs, now the tool will automatically generate the analytical data. This tool really contributes to the efficiency of the auditors. The fundamental course outline include:\n\nThere are several certification programs from various CAATs vendors and professional associations as the following:\n\nIn addition to using data analysis software, the auditor uses CAATs throughout the audit for the following activities while performing data analysis:\n\nKeeping electronic work papers on a centralized audit file or database will allow the auditor to navigate through current and archived working papers with ease. The database will make it easier for auditors to coordinate current audits and ensure they consider findings from prior or related projects. Additionally, the auditor will be able to electronically standardize audit forms and formats, which can improve both the quality and consistency of the audit working papers.\n\nCAATs provides auditors with tools that can identify unexpected or unexplained patterns in data that may indicate fraud. Whether the CAATs is simple or complex, data analysis provides many benefits in the prevention and detection of fraud.\n\nCAATs can assist the auditor in detecting fraud by performing and creating the following,\n\nEvaluations of financial information made by studying plausible relationships among both financial and non-financial data to assess whether account balances appear reasonable (AU 329). Examples include ratio, trend, and Benford's Law tests.\n\nReports produced using specific audit commands such as filtering records and joining data files.\n\nContinuous monitoring is an ongoing process for acquiring, analyzing, and reporting on business data to identify and respond to operational business risks. For auditors to ensure a comprehensive approach to acquire, analyze, and report on business data, they must make certain the organization continuously monitors user activity on all computer systems, business transactions and processes, and application controls.\n\nCurb stoning is the term for instances where a surveyor completes a survey form by making up data. Because some of the data should conform with Benford's law, this practice can be detected using CAATTs which provide the capability of performing such tests.\n\nCAATTs and CAATs are used interchangeably. While CAATs has emerged as the more common spelling, CAATTs is the more precise acronym. The acronym CAATTs solves one of the two problems with defining the acronym. CAATs means:\n\n\"C\"omputer \"A\"ided (or \"A\"ssisted) \"A\"udit \"T\"echniques (or \"T\"ools and \"T\"echniques)\n\nThe first \"A\" and the \"T\" can have two different meanings depending on who uses the term. By using the term CAATTs, one is clearly incorporating both \"Tools\" AND \"Techniques.\"\n\nThe following table compares features of specialized computer-aided audit tools. The table has several fields, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The headgrowth or hood (also known as \"wen\" or \"crown\") may be a prominent growth on the top of the head (cranial region) or may encase the entire face except for the eyes and mouth.\n\nWhen it was first imported from China to Japan it was mistakenly thought to be native to the Netherlands, and was therefore dubbed the \"Holland Lionmask\", Dutch Lionhead, and \"Netherlands Lion Head\" (オランダ獅子頭), from which its English name \"oranda\" derives.\n\nDue to the fleshy outgrowth on the upper half of its head and sides of its face, the oranda has become one of the most popular goldfish. The headgrowth is described as a \"wen\" by Chinese aquarists. \n\nThe oranda is a metallic or matte scaled goldfish that is similar in appearance to the veiltail. It has a large, long and deep body accompanied by a long quadruple tail. This four-lobed and contracted tail normally spreads out broadly when the oranda stops swimming. The back does not rise up to form a ryukin-like hump. \n\nOrandas are available in a variety of colors, most often orange, red, red-and-white, red-and-black, black, blue, chocolate, bronze, white or silver, black-and-white (panda-colored), red-black-and-white (tricolor), and calico colors.\n\nThe headgrowth of young fry may take one to two years to develop. \nThe oranda can reach 20 to 31 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) in length. Sometimes the wen grows enormously covering the eyes of the goldfish. Due to this, the eyesight may become limited or even blind. Special care should be given to the wen because it is prone to bacterial infections. The Oranda\ncan tolerate temperatures from 17 to 28 °C (65 to 80 °F). More recently blue scale oranda have been developed but these fish are very rare.\nOranda goldfish are especially sensitive to cold temperatures, more so than other goldfish.\n\n\nOrandas are sensitive to low water temperatures and can be kept with other goldfish.\nIf their wen grows too much, it may hinder vision, so it is advised to keep them with other goldfish with similarly poor vision in order to make sure that they do not starve because of the able-sighted competition. Some aquarists prefer to trim the wen off of the goldfish by using a scissor to prevent blindness and doused with peroxide to prevent from damaging essential areas around the face or body. Their wen is also susceptible to injury from rough objects placed in their residence.\n\n"}

The album contains mostly new material but also new versions of a couple of the old demos. Solid State later distributed a collection of the early Embodyment death metal demos titled \"[1993-1996]\" in addition to releasing a previously unreleased track by the band called “Halo of Winter” on the label’s compilation album, “This Is Solid State Vol. I”.\n\nAfter kicking vocalist Kris McCaddon out, Sean Corbray joined the band and introduced a markedly different vocal style to the band, evidenced on the followup to \"Embrace the Eternal\", titled \"The Narrow Scope of Things\". This album was the band's first step away from any of the heavier metal subgenres. Instead, their sound on the album was adjusted to alternative metal with hard rock influences and featured actual singing and some screamed vocal parts rather than any form of death metal vocals.\n\nEmbodyment's third and final album for Solid State, \"Hold Your Breath\", continued in the direction seen on \"The Narrow Scope of Things\" toward more alternative and hard rock stylings. \"Hold Your Breath\" was Embodyment's first album that featured no screamed vocals, only singing vocals. Embodyment's last album, \"Songs for the Living\", was much the same, showing even less of the dwindling metal influence heard on \"Hold Your Breath\". Embodyment had shopped the \"Songs for the Living\" material around as an industry demo, looking for a new label, but after finding little interest they released it as an album on XS Records. Embodyment disbanded in early 2004 after having partially written a follow up record.\n\nAndrew Godwin, Mark Garza, and Chris McCaddon, most of the lineup of the original Embodyment, have since formed The Famine, a band that returns to the members' metal roots.\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that Newgrounds member QuinnZX had submitted Embodyment songs to the popular Adobe Flash website, taking credit for the songs and submitting them to a top-50 ranking music game on the site, which held onto the tracks for some time before the theft was noticed. He was subsequently banned, and the songs removed. The game's programmer issued an apology for the confusion, viewable on its start screen.\n\nIn February 2011, a 5-song EP named \"Forgotten\" was released on iTunes. This EP consisted of 5 songs left over from the \"Songs for the Living\" era.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are often off-metal strike, to proof standard or piedforts. Many coin collectors collect and study pattern coins because of their historical importance. Many of the world's most valuable coins are pattern coins; nearly one quarter of the pieces listed in \"100 Greatest US Coins\" are pattern coins.\n\nThe first English coin that can be identified with certainty is a groat, originally worth fourpence. This piece, an example of which was illustrated and sold in the Dodsley Cuff sale of the mid-19th century, had crowns in place of the usual three pellets in each quarter of the reverse.\n\nPatterns are particularly identifiable and exist in larger numbers from the reign of Elizabeth I onwards. The experimental base metal issues of all coinage prior to the mid-18th century have been well preserved.\n\nBoulton's mint in Soho produced large quantities of patterns, which were supplemented by Taylor some fifty or so years later from the same dies.\n\nAfter the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776, discussion arose over what sort of currency should be adopted in the United States. At the time, people in North America relied upon a mixture of foreign coins, none of which were struck to a consistent standard, making day to day financial transactions difficult. In 1783, Congress resolved to create a mint, tasking Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris with developing a plan for a system of coinage. The first coins struck by the United States – the Nova Constellatio patterns – were made to illustrate this plan.\n\nIn 1792 the United States Mint opened in Philadelphia. In that year several more patterns were created, including the half dime, then known as a \"half disme\". It is believed that 1,500 pieces were struck as patterns, and that these patterns themselves entered circulation during the next decade.\n\nOver the next 40 years, more patterns were created but there is little information currently known about these pieces. Technically, these coins were not patterns but rather off-metal strikes, with the coins struck in a different metal than those destined for general use in circulation. An example is an 1807 Half Eagle, or five dollar gold piece struck in copper.\n\nStarting in 1836, more patterns were created by the United States Mint in Philadelphia. These consisted of several types of patterns:\n\nOne example of a pattern coin for proposed coinage is the half-union, a gold pattern coin with a face value of 50 U.S. dollars that was minted in 1877 and weighed . The U.S. Mint deemed the idea of a 2.5-ounce gold coin infeasible, and only two were ever minted.\n\nTransitional pieces are patterns dated before coins with the new design officially went into circulation. These were often produced during final stage of the pattern process, used to present the newly adopted design to the public. One famous example is the 1856 Flying Eagle cent, although that coin has been commonly and incorrectly believed to be regular issue due to its high mintage for collectors.\n\nFantasy pieces include many struck in the 1860s and 1870s as patterns and sold to numismatists for the sole purpose of raising cash for the mint. This practice ended in the 1880s, when the U.S. Mint enforced regulations to prevent the sale of pattern coins.\n\nThe U.S. Mint experiments with new coinage occasionally, such as when silver was removed from coin designs. The Mint began using dies with Martha Washington for trial strikings, since they would not be confused with real circulating money since they do not resemble money. Thus, no restrictions exist on the sale of Martha Washington pieces. Mint-produced modern patterns are very rare, with only a few pieces existing in private collections. The United States mint has placed restrictions on the sale of modern patterns that do resemble coins, such as the 1974 aluminum cent. One of the most expansive collections of American pattern coins is the Harry W. Bass, Jr. collection housed at the American Numismatic Association Money Museum in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nPattern coins of France and of French-speaking countries such as Monaco are described by the French term \"essai\". The essai coins of New Hebrides are of interest to collectors of British Commonwealth coinage, as New Hebrides gained independence in 1980 as the Republic of Vanuatu.\n\nThe word \"essai\" is found inscribed on the pattern coins of Namibia along with the German word \"Probe\".\n\n\n"}

The title was defended in Hardcore matches, in which there were few rules and restrictions and weapons were allowed. Eventually, the rules were changed so that matches began in the backstage area but would only end by pinfall in the ring, but later were changed back to 'Falls Count Anywhere' rules. The belt was created in response to the growing popularity of hardcore wrestling in North America.\n\nThe title lasted from 1999 to 2001. The very first WCW Hardcore champion was Norman Smiley who defeated Brian Knobs in Toronto, Ontario at the WCW pay-per-view Mayhem on November 21, 1999. Other notable champions are 3 Count who won and defended the belt as a trio. Brian Knobs who held the belt a record three times and was the one to defeat 3 Count at Uncensored 2000. Terry Funk (a two time hardcore champ) also held the title for a period of almost two months, from April–June 2000 when he was defeated by Eric Bischoff at a WCW Monday Nitro in Atlanta, Georgia. Bischoff later awarded the title to Big Vito as a reward for helping him take it from Funk. In 2000, as part of a storyline where he renamed singles titles that he had won, Lance Storm won the Hardcore Championship and, as he had done with the Cruiserweight and U.S. titles (renaming them the 100 Kilos and Under and Canadian championships), changed the name of the title to the Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title (or S.H.I.T for short).\n\nThe final hardcore champion in WCW was Meng, who defeated Crowbar and reigning champ Terry Funk at WCW Sin on January 14, 2001. It was largely abandoned after Meng left the company to return to the WWF. Meng presented the championship to Barbarian as a gift at an independent wrestling event on January 21, 2001. The belt was not defended again nor was it featured on the final episode of \"Nitro\" which was also known as \"Night of Champions\". The title belt was handed over formally to the WWF upon the purchase of WCW. The title is now displayed in WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nThe WCW Hardcore Title was a continuation from the WCW Hardcore Trophy that Fit Finlay won in the Junkyard Battle Royal that took place at the 1999 Bash at the Beach pay-per-view. Shortly after the PPV, the trophy was seized by Eric Bischoff and removed from television. Afterwards Norman Smiley was crowned first official WCW hardcore champion.\n\nNorman Smiley held the record for the longest official reign at 51 days.

{"id": "1986729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986729", "title": "Bellona (goddess)", "text": "Bellona (goddess)\n\nBellona () was an ancient Roman goddess of war. Her main attribute is the military helmet worn on her head; she often holds a sword, spear, or shield, and brandishes a torch or whip as she rides into battle in a four-horse chariot. She had a temple near the Theatre of Marcellus. Her iconography was extended by painters and sculptors following the Renaissance.\n\nThe goddess of war \"Bellōna\" is a derivative of the Latin word \"bellum\" ('war, warfare'; from an older \"duellum\"), possibly stemming from \"*duenelo-\" ('quite good, quite brave'), a reconstructed diminutive of the word \"bonus\" ('good'; attested as \"duenos\" in early Old Latin). According to linguist Michiel de Vaan, \"its use in the context of war (\"bella acta, bella gesta\") could be understood as a euphemism, ultimately yielding a meaning 'action of valour, war' for the noun \"bellum\".\" The name of the goddess is also attested as the genitive singular \"Duelonai\" in an inscription.\n\nOriginally named \"Duellona\" in the Italic languages, the cult figure who became Bellona was an ancient Sabine goddess of war and identified with Nerio, the consort of the war god Mars - and later with the Greek Enyo. Her first temple in Rome was dedicated in 296 BCE, where her festival was celebrated on 3 June. Her priests were known as Bellonarii and used to wound their own arms or legs as a blood sacrifice to her. These rites took place on 24 March, called the day of blood (\"dies sanguinis\"), after the ceremony. In consequence of this practice, which approximated to the rites dedicated to Cybele in Asia Minor, both Enyo and Bellona became identified with her Cappadocian aspect, Ma.\n\nThe Roman Campus Martius area, in which Bellona’s temple was situated, had extraterritorial status. Ambassadors from foreign states, who were not allowed to enter the city proper, stayed in this complex. Since the area of the temple was outside the pomerium, the Senate met there with ambassadors and received victorious generals prior to their triumphs. Beside the temple was the war column (\"columna bellica\"), which represented non-Roman territory. To declare war on a distant state, a javelin was thrown over the column by one of the priests concerned with diplomacy (\"fetiales\") in a modification of the archaic practice, from Roman territory toward the direction of the enemy land and this symbolical attack was considered the opening of war.\n\nIn the military cult of Bellona, she was associated with Virtus, the personification of valour. She then travelled outside Rome with the imperial legions and her temples have been recorded in France, Germany, Britain, and North Africa.\n\nOften in poetry the name Bellona is used simply as a synonym for war, although in the \"Thebaid\" of Statius the goddess appears as a character, representing the destructive and belligerent aspect of war. There she is described as carrying a spear and a flaming torch or riding in a chariot and waving a blood-stained sword.\n\nBellona is commonly portrayed wearing a plumed helmet and dressed in armour, or at least a breastplate with a skirt beneath. In her hand she carries a spear, shield, or other weapons, and occasionally, she sounds a trumpet for the attack. She was sometimes associated with the winged Victory holding a laurel crown in her hand, a statue of whom she sometimes carries; when she appears on war memorials she may hold that attribute.\n\nExamples of such an armoured figure appear in the 1633 painting attributed to Rembrandt in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and statues by Johann Baptist Straub (1770) and Johann Wilhelm Beyer (1773–80). In the latter she appears with the god Janus, since both were associated with the Roman ceremonies of declaring war. In the case of Janus, the doors to his temple were left open during the whole period of hostilities.\nStraub's statue has a gorgon head on her shield to instil terror in her enemies, as does the Rembrandt painting, although this was added later, probably as a response to other examples of this new iconographical departure. In the bust by Bertram Mackennal she wears a gorgon mounted on her helmet, while in other depictions it is on the breastplate. Another common innovation was Bellona’s association with cannons, as in the drawing by Hans Krieg (1590–1645) and the 1700 ceiling fresco at Hammerschloss Schmidmühlen by Hans Georg Asam (1649–1711). An early Dutch engraving in a series of prints depicting \"Personifications of Industrial and Professional Life\" suggests that it is this goddess who inspires the invention of war materiels, showing her seated in a factory workshop with all manner of arms at her feet (plate 6, see the Gallery below). In the fresco by Constantino Brumidi in the U.S. Capitol (1855–60), her image is updated. There she is shown standing next to an artillery piece and has the stars and stripes on her shield.\n\nNot all representations of Bellona wear armour. The statues by Alvise Tagliapietra at St. Petersburg (c.1710) and that at the J. Paul Getty Museum by Augustin Pajou (1775/85) are largely naked, although otherwise wearing or carrying some of the other attributes of the goddess. There are Classical references that sanction this, however. In Gaius Valerius Flaccus' \"Argonautica\", for example, appears the description \"Bellona with bare flank, her brazen weapons clanging as she moved\" (3. 60). A further poetic reference taken up by a painter occurs in Louis Jean François Lagrenée's \"Bellona Presenting the Reins of his Horses to Mars\" (1766). This illustrates a speech from Claudian's \"In Ruffinum\" where Mars requests \"Let Bellona bring my helmet and Terror guide the reins\" (\"Fer galleam Bellona mihi, nexusque rotarum tende Pavor\"). Jan van Mieris’ allegorical painting of \"Wisdom restraining Bellona\" (1685) is also poetic. There the seated figure of Wisdom clasps the right hand of the helmeted goddess, who is turning to leave, her cloak fluttering behind her and her shield held high in her outstretched left hand.\n\nWhile she does not figure as a character in Shakespeare's plays, she receives several mentions. In \"Henry IV, Part I\", Hotspur describes her as \"the fire-eyed maid of smoky war\" (IV.i.119). In The Two Noble Kinsmen, set in pre-Roman Athens, the sister of Hippolyta will solicit her divine aid for Theseus against Thebes (I.iii.13). At the start of the play named after him, \"Macbeth\" is introduced as a violent and brave warrior when the Thane of Ross calls him \"Bellona's bridegroom\" (I.ii.54), that is to say, the equivalent of Mars. \nIn more modern times, Adam Lindsay Gordon dedicated an energetic Swinburnean evocation of the \"false goddess\" who leads men astray in his poem \"Bellona\", published in Australia in 1867. She also figures in Edgell Rickword's World War I poem \"The Traveller\". There the poet describes himself as marching toward the front line in the company of Art, the god Pan, and the works of Walter Pater. Meeting Bellona as they approach the fighting, one by one the pleasurable companions are forced to flee before the violence of war, until the goddess rejoices in having him to herself.\n\nBellona appears in the prologue of Rameau's opera, \"Les Indes Galantes\" (1735), in which the call of love ultimately triumphs over that of war. In a Bach \"dramma per musica\" performed two years before, \"Tönet, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!\" BWV 214, the goddess even quitted her usual ferocity in order to congratulate Maria Josepha of Austria, Princess Elector of Saxony and Queen of Poland, on her birthday on 8 December 1733.\n\nShe retains her harsh aspect in \"Prometheus Absolved\" by Giovanni Ambrogio Migliavacca (1718–1795), however. In this cantata celebrating the birth of the Archduchess Isabella in 1762, the deities sit in judgement on Prometheus, some arguing for clemency, while Bellona and others demand rigour. She also plays her proper part in the 'heroic cantata' created by the composer Francesco Bianchi and the librettist Lorenzo da Ponte, entitled \"The Wedding of the Thames and Bellona\" (\"Le nozze del Tamigi e Bellona\"). This was performed in London to mark the British naval victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797).\n\nAs well as having a decorative function, representations of the goddess had a public function too. Batholomaeus Spranger's \"Bellona Leading the Imperial Armies against the Turks\" (see above) played its part in Austria's anti-Turkish propaganda during the Long Turkish War. A later phase of the continuing conflict, culminating in victory at the battle of Zenta in 1697, is marked by Jean Cosyn's celebratory doorway in Brussels in what now is known as the Maison de Bellone, at the centre of which presides the helmeted bust of the goddess surrounded by military standards and cannons.\n\nA dynastic political statement is made in \"Marie de Medici as Bellona\" (1622/5), designed by Peter Paul Rubens for her public rooms in the Luxembourg Palace. He represents her there as a wielder of political power at a time when it, in fact, had waned. She is standing with armour, cannons, and muskets at her feet, and her triumphs are underlined by emblems of victory. She carries a small statue of the winged goddess in her right hand, a smaller winged figure is mounted below the plumes of her helmet, while cupids hover above her, holding a laurel crown. Her portrayal contrasts with Rembrandt's depiction of Bellona with the homely features of an ordinary Dutchwoman. This makes an anti-imperial statement, with the assurance that the new Dutch Republic is ready to defend itself, particularly against Spain, during the Thirty Years' War.\nAuguste Rodin's sculpture of a head of Bellona (1879) originally was created for a monument to the French Third Republic and shows even more belligerence. Modelled on his mistress Rose Beuret while in a bad mood, the head is drawn back in proud anger, turning in dynamic movement to look along the line of her right shoulder. Defence in war is the message of Georg Kolbe's Bellona fountain in Wuppertal. Originally commissioned in 1915, it depicted the helmeted goddess carrying a sword in her left hand and inspiring a kneeling young man. The statue was not erected until 1922, by which time it functioned as a war memorial.\n\nThe use of Bellona in such structures was well established before this, dating back to her prominent use in Jean Cosyn's doorway. The Temple of Bellona, designed by William Chambers for Kew Gardens in 1760, was projected as a celebration of the Anglo-Hanoverian war effort during the Seven Years' War and eventually housed plaques honouring the regiments that served in it. These, however, related primarily to remembrance of victory rather than of the fallen. It was not until a century afterward that the French-Canadian victims of the Seven Years War were commemorated by a monument at Quebec. Atop a tall column on the site of the battlefield, Bellona looks down, carrying a shield and laurel crown in her right hand. The statue was presented by Jérôme-Napoléon in 1862 as a gesture of reconciliation.\n\nThe Australian dead from the Gallipoli Campaign were commemorated by a bronze bust of Bellona by Bertram Mackennal, a former student of Rodin. This he presented to the Australian government in Canberra as a memorial in 1916. As in Rodin's bust, the helmeted head is turned to the right, but the breasts are more in evidence. The fallen generally make their appearance later in such structures where Bellona is present. They accompany the sword-wielding goddess in Douglas Tilden's monument to the California Volunteers during the Spanish–American War of 1898; in the Bialystok memorial to the dead in the Polish–Soviet War in 1920, she stands behind a soldier and holds aloft a laurel crown.\n\nThe Bellona on the First World War victory archway at Waterloo station is particularly memorable, however. Beneath the demonic sword-brandishing wraith with her gorgon necklace, cower and mourn, not the dead, but the overlooked living victims of war.\n\n"}

Since 1970, the current campus on West 49th Avenue has housed Langara's programs for almost 50 years. On April 1, 1994, Langara College was established as an independent public college under the Provincial College and Institute Act. Langara College Continuing Studies was established in 1997. To provide more space, a new classroom and office building was opened in January 1997. The new library/classroom building was opened in September 2007. Langara College began the construction of the Science and Technology Building in 2013 as part of Phase II (of IV) of the Master Plan to upgrade and expand the campus. Construction was officially completed in September 2016.\n\nMusqueam, whose unceded territory Langara currently occupies, gave the traditional name snəw̓eyəɬ leləm̓ meaning 'house of teachings' to the college in January 2016. \"snəw̓eyəɬ\" references advice given to children to guide them into adulthood and build their character. This is the first time that a British Columbia First Nation gave an indigenous name to a public, post-secondary institution.\n\nPrograms and courses at Langara College are delivered in the following subject areas:\n\nLangara College provides university-level programs and courses and offers a variety of qualifications, including baccalaureate degrees, associate degrees, diplomas, certificates, and citations. The three 4-year degree programs offered by the College are Nursing, Recreation Management, and Business Administration. Langara's wide range of academic programs in more than 60 subject areas are offered over three semesters per year. Langara is a popular choice for university transfer students due to smaller class sizes, excellent support services, and competitive tuition fees. More students transfer to BC universities from Langara College than from any other college in the province.\n\nLangara College offers career programs leading to one-year certificates, two-year diplomas, and four-year bachelor's degrees in fields that lead to careers in business, industry, community services, and the arts. Although some of Langara's career programs require that students complete the program within a specific time period, many of the programs can be completed on a part-time basis.\n\nLangara College's Continuing Studies department offers over 700 courses and 35 certificate programs year-round. The department's strategic objective is to provide lifelong learning opportunities to meet the individual needs of students. There are 4479 Continuing Studies students in the Fall 2016 term.\n\nStudio 58, Langara College's School of Theatre Arts offers professional theatre training for actors and production personnel.

{"id": "1986739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986739", "title": "Communitas", "text": "Communitas\n\nCommunitas is a Latin noun commonly referring either to an unstructured community in which people are equal, or to the very spirit of community. It also has special significance as a loanword in cultural anthropology and the social sciences. Victor Turner, who defined the anthropological usage of communitas, was interested in the interplay between what he called social 'structure' and 'antistructure'; \"Liminality\" and \"Communitas\" are both components of antistructure.\n\nCommunitas refers to an unstructured state in which all members of a community are equal allowing them to share a common experience, usually through a rite of passage. Communitas is characteristic of people experiencing liminality together. This term is used to distinguish the modality of social relationship from an area of common living. There is more than one distinction between structure and communitas. The most familiar is the difference of secular and sacred. Every social position has something sacred about it. This sacred component is acquired during rites of passages, through the changing of positions. Part of this sacredness is achieved through the transient humility learned in these phases, this allows people to reach a higher position.\n\nCommunitas is an acute point of community. It takes community to the next level and allows the whole of the community to share a common experience, usually through a rite of passage. This brings everyone onto an equal level: even if you are higher in position, you have been lower and you know what that is.\n\nTurner (1969, Pg.132; see also ) distinguishes between:\n\nCommunitas as a concept used by Victor Turner in his study of ritual has been criticized by anthropologists. See John Eade & Michael J. Sallnow's \"Contesting the Sacred\" (1991)\n\nEdith Turner, Victor's widow and anthropologist in her own right, published in 2011 a definitive overview of the anthropology of communitas, outlining the concept in relation to the natural history of joy, including the nature of human experience and its narration, festivals, music and sports, work, disaster, the sacred, revolution and nonviolence, nature and spirit, and ritual and rites of passage.\n\n\"Communitas\" is also the title of a book published in 1947 by the 20th-century American thinker and writer Paul Goodman and his brother, Percival Goodman. Their book examines three kinds of possible societies: a society centered on consumption, a society centered on artistic and creative pursuits, and a society which maximizes human liberty. The Goodmans emphasize freedom from both coercion by a government or church and from human necessities by providing these free of cost to all citizens who do a couple of years of conscripted labor as young adults.\n\nIn 1998, Italian philosopher Roberto Esposito published a book under the name \"Communitas\" challenging the traditional understanding of this concept. It was translated in English in 2010 by Timothy Campbell. In this book, Esposito offers a very different interpretation of the concept of \"communitas\" based on a thorough etymological analysis of the word: \"Community isn't a property, nor is it a territory to be separated and defended against those who do not belong to it. Rather, it is a void, a debt, a gift to the other that also reminds us of our constitutive alterity with respect to ourselves.\" He goes on with his \"deconstruction\" of the concept of \"communitas\": \"From here it emerges that \"communitas\" is the totality of persons united not by a \"property\" but precisely by an obligation or a debt; not by an \"addition\" but by a \"subtraction\": by a lack, a limit that is configured as an onus, or even as a defective modality for him who is \"affected\", unlike for him who is instead \"exempt\" or \"exempted\". Here we find the final and most characteristic of the oppositions associated with (or that dominate) the alternative between public and private, those in other words that contrast \"communitas\" to \"immunitas\". If \"communis\" is he who is required to carry out the functions of an office ― or to the donation of a grace ― on the contrary, he is called immune who has to perform no office, and for that reason he remains ungrateful. He can completely preserve his own position through a \"vacatio muneris\". Whereas the \"communitas\" is bound by the sacrifice of the \"compensatio\", the \"immunitas\" implies the beneficiary of the \"dispensatio\".\"\"Therefore the community cannot be thought of as a body, as a corporation in which individuals are founded in a larger individual. Neither is community to be interpreted as a mutual, intersubjective \"recognition\" in which individuals are reflected in each other so as to confirm their initial identity; as a collective bond that comes at a certain point to connect individuals that before were separate. The community isn't a mode of being, much less a \"making\" of the individual subject. It isn't the subject's expansion or multiplication but its exposure to what interrupts the closing and turns it inside out: a dizziness, a syncope, a spasm in the continuity of the subject.\"\n\nFor more on this perspective, see also Jean-Luc Nancy's paper \"The Confronted Community\" as well as his book \"The Inoperative Community\". See also Maurice Blanchot's book \"The Unavowable Community\" (1983) which is an answer to Jean-Luc Nancy's \"Inoperative Community\". Giorgio Agamben engages in a similar argument about the concept of community in his 1990 book \"The Coming Community\" (translated in English by Michael Hardt in 1993). Rémi Astruc, a French scholar, recently proposed in his essay \"Nous? L'aspiration à la Communauté et les arts\" (2015), to operate a distinction between Community with a capital C as the longing for \"communitas\" and communities (plural and small c) to name the numerous actualizations in human societies. Finally, on the American side, see \"The Community of Those Who Have Nothing in Common\" by Alphonso Lingis. Christian author Alan Hirsch used the term to describe a more active, tighter-knit community in his book \"The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986746", "title": "Nancy Lincoln", "text": "Nancy Lincoln\n\nNancy Hanks Lincoln (February 5, 1784 – October 5, 1818) was the mother of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Her marriage to Thomas Lincoln also produced a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Thomas Jr. When Nancy and Thomas had been married for just over 10 years, the family moved from Kentucky to Perry County, Indiana, in 1816. Nancy Lincoln died from milk sickness or consumption at the Little Pigeon Creek Community in Spencer County when Abraham was nine years old.\n\nThis article reflects the prevailing theories regarding Nancy Hanks Lincoln's heritage. There is information, however, published about the Shipley and Berry family and for Kentucky heritage sites that differs from the prevailing theory. This is explored in greater detail in the Nancy Hanks Lincoln heritage article.\n\nNancy Hanks was born to Lucy Hanks in what was at that time part of Hampshire County, Virginia. Today, the same location is in Antioch in Mineral County, West Virginia. Abraham Lincoln's law partner William Herndon reported that Lincoln told him that his maternal grandfather was \"a well-bred Virginia farmer or planter.\"\nAccording to William E. Barton in \"The Life of Abraham Lincoln\" and Michael Burkhimer in \"100 Essential Lincoln Books\", Nancy was most likely born illegitimate and her family created stories to lead Abraham to believe he was a legitimate member of the Sparrow family.\n\nIt is believed that Nancy Hanks' grandparents were Ann and Joseph Hanks and that they raised her from infancy until her grandfather died when she was about nine years old. At the time of Nancy's birth, Joseph and his wife and children were all living on 108 acres near Patterson Creek in then-Hampshire County, Virginia. In March 1784, Joseph Hanks sold his property via a mortgage and moved his wife, eight children and young granddaughter Nancy to Kentucky.\n\nThe family lived on land along Pottinger's Creek, in a settlement called Rolling Fork in Nelson County, Kentucky, until patriarch Joseph's death in 1793. Nancy's grandmother, who was called by the more formal name Ann rather than the common nickname of Nancy, decided to return to her homeland, Farnham parish in Virginia. At that time, Nancy went to live with her mother, now Lucy Hanks Sparrow, having married Henry Sparrow in Harrodsburg, Kentucky two or three years earlier.\n\nAfter Lucy's sister Elizabeth Hanks married Henry Sparrow's brother Thomas in Mercer County, Kentucky in 1796, Nancy went to live with the couple, whom she called mother and father. She was known as Nancy Sparrow and was described as \"intelligent, deeply religious, kindly and affectionate.\" Lucy's sister gave birth to an illegitimate son in 1799 named Dennis Friend Hanks, who was also raised by Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow.\n\nAt the home of Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow, Nancy would have learned the skills and crafts a woman needed on the frontier to cultivate crops and clothe and feed her family. She learned to read the Bible and became an excellent seamstress, working at the Richard Berry home before her marriage.\n\nLucy's marriage to Henry Sparrow produced eight children, and Lucy had a reputation as a \"fine Christian woman.\" Two sons were loyal to the Union during the Civil War and were preachers.\n\nOn June 12, 1806, Hanks married Thomas Lincoln at Beechland, the home of Richard Berry, by Reverend Jesse Head. Nancy was brought to the home to work as a seamstress by her friend Polly Ewing Berry, the wife of Richard Berry Jr. since October 10, 1794. Polly was a friend of Nancy's from Mercer County, Kentucky, and Richard Berry Jr. was a good friend of Thomas Lincoln. Lincoln proposed to her in his childhood home at what is now Lincoln Homestead State Park or in the Francis Berry house in front of the fireplace.\n\nNancy's marriage bond was signed by Richard Berry Jr., who identified himself as her guardian. Per Warren, \"The title had no legal significance, Berry having never been so appointed, and Nancy Hanks was then of age. But of him to call himself 'guardian' was a courtesy customary under such circumstances [no father able to sign the marriage bond].\" A record of their marriage license is held at the county courthouse.\n\nThey had three children:\n\nThe young family lived in what was then Hardin County, Kentucky (now LaRue) on the Knob Creek Farm. Neighbors reported that Nancy Hanks Lincoln was \"superior\" to her husband, a mild yet strong personality who taught young Abraham his letters as well as the extraordinary sweetness and forbearance for which he was known. In 1816, the year that Indiana became the 19th state, the Lincoln family moved to Spencer County in southern Indiana and proceeded to homestead at Little Pigeon Creek Settlement (now Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial). Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow and Dennis Hanks settled at Little Pigeon Creek the following fall, having lived in a shelter in which the Lincolns had lived until they built their cabin. While Abraham was ten years younger than his second cousin Dennis, the boys were good friends.\n\nWilliam Herndon, author of \"Life of Lincoln\", describes Nancy Hanks Lincoln:\nShe was above the ordinary height in stature, weighed about 130 pounds, was slenderly built, and had much the appearance of one inclined to consumption. Her skin was dark; hair dark brown; eyes gray and small; forehead prominent; face sharp and angular, with a marked expression for melancholy which fixed itself in the memory of all who ever saw or knew her. Though her life was clouded by a spirit of sadness, she was in disposition amiable and generally cheerful.\n\nNancy was also described as \"a bold, reckless, daredevil kind of woman, stepping on to the very verge of propriety.\"\n\nAbraham Lincoln inherited his mother's appearance and manner. She was \"mild, tender, and intellectually inclined.\"\n\nWhile living at Little Pigeon Creek Settlement, Nancy Hanks Lincoln died on October 5, 1818, age 34. Her nine-year-old son Abraham assisted his father in the making of her coffin by whittling the wooden pegs that held the planks together. Eleven-year-old Sarah cared for Abraham until their father remarried the next year.\n\nThere are two views as to the cause of Nancy Hanks Lincoln's death. One view is that she died of \"milk sickness.\" Several people had died that fall from the illness, including Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow, who raised her and then lived with her on the Lincolns' property at the Little Pigeon Creek settlement. The Sparrows died in September, weeks before Nancy's death, and Dennis moved in with the Lincolns. The illness was caused by drinking the milk or eating the meat of cows that had eaten white snakeroot. The plant contains the potent toxin tremetol, which is passed through the milk. The migrants from the East were unfamiliar with the Midwestern plant and its effects. In the 19th century before people understood the cause of the illness, thousands in the Midwest died of milk sickness.\n\nThe second view is that Nancy died of consumption. In 1870 Lincoln's law partner and biographer, William Herndon, wrote to fellow Lincoln biographer Ward Lamon saying that \"Mrs. Lincoln died as said by some with the milk sickness, some with a galloping quick consumption\",\ni.e. a wasting disease or tuberculosis. It has also been theorized that Nancy Lincoln had a marfanoid body habitus (or a marfanoid type of physique) with the same unusual facial features as her son. This theory suggests that she died of cancer (which is a wasting disease) related to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN2B), and that she passed the gene for this syndrome to her son (see Medical and mental health of Abraham Lincoln).\n\nNancy's grave is located in what has been named the Pioneer Cemetery, also known as the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Cemetery. Her headstone was purchased by P. E. Studebaker, an industrialist from South Bend, in 1878. At least 20 unmarked and eight marked graves are at the site; Nancy Lincoln is buried next to Nancy Rusher Brooner, a neighbor who died a week before Nancy from milk sickness. Henry Brooner, Nancy Brooner's son and best childhood friend of Abraham Lincoln, later recalled, \"I remember very distinctly that when Mrs. Lincoln's grave was filled, my father, Peter Brooner, extended his hand to Thomas Lincoln and said, 'We are brothers now', meaning that they were brothers in the same kind of sorrow. The bodies of my mother and Mrs. Lincoln were conveyed to their graves on sleds.\" Her aunt and uncle Elizabeth (Hanks) and Thomas Sparrow, also her childhood caregivers, are buried nearby. The cemetery is located on the grounds of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, a National Historic Landmark District managed by the National Park Service in present-day Lincoln City, Indiana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hanks–Lincoln wedding was portrayed in a play called \"Dearly Beloved: The Vows of a Lincoln Legacy\" to kick off a three-year bicentennial celebration of Abraham Lincoln's life. The play was held at the Lincoln Homestead State Park in Springfield, Kentucky.\n\nNancy is portrayed by Maria Hill in the Daniel Boone episode \"Before the Tall Man.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1986758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986758", "title": "Herschel Greer Stadium", "text": "Herschel Greer Stadium\n\nHerschel Greer Stadium was a Minor League Baseball park in Nashville, Tennessee, on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately south of the city's downtown district. The facility closed at the end of the 2014 baseball season and remained deserted for over four years until its demolition in 2019. Following the completion of the demolition project and an archaeological survey, the land is expected to be reincorporated into Fort Negley Park.\n\nGreer was opened in 1978 for the Nashville Sounds, an expansion franchise of the Double-A Southern League who moved to the Triple-A American Association in 1985 and to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998. The stadium played host to the team until 2014. The subject of numerous upgrades and repairs to maintain its functionality, Greer became one of the oldest stadiums used by a Triple-A team, and by the end of its use had fallen well below professional baseball's standards for a stadium at that class level. For over a decade, the Sounds attempted to secure agreements with the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County for a new ballpark to replace Greer, eventually resulting in the construction of First Tennessee Park, which became the Sounds' new home in 2015.\n\nAmidst the Sounds' 37-season run, Greer simultaneously hosted two professional baseball clubs in 1993 and 1994, acting as a temporary home to a displaced Southern League franchise known during that period as the Nashville Xpress. The stadium also saw occasional use as a venue for college baseball, high school football, and charity softball events. It was the site of three minor league all-star games, eight no-hitters, including one perfect game, and a 24-inning game which tied the record for the longest game in Pacific Coast League history. The stadium was best recognized by its distinctive guitar-shaped scoreboard.\n\nLarry Schmittou, the leader of an effort to bring professional baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, knew he would need to build a new ballpark for his team as the city's previous ballpark, Sulphur Dell, had been demolished in 1969. He learned from a member of the Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Parks Board or the city of Nashville would be willing to pay for such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from country musician Conway Twitty, put together a group of investors including other country artists Cal Smith and Jerry Reed, as well as other Nashvillians, to finance a stadium and a minor league team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately south of downtown, for a period of 20 years as long as he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least US$400,000 within 10 years. The city would also relocate the city-owned softball complex that occupied the site. Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, and paying the city seven percent of the team's total revenue in the second ten years.\n\nStoll-Reed Architects advised Schmittou that construction of a suitable stadium would cost between $300,000 and $500,000, but bids for the project ranged from $980,000 to $1.2 million. Schmittou looked to local suppliers to donate construction materials, took out a $30,000 loan from a bank, sold season tickets in advance of having a team, and even mortgaged his own home to help pay for the facility. The actual cost totaled $1.5 million. The stadium was posthumously named for Herschel Lynn Greer, a prominent Nashville businessman and the first president of Vols, Inc., an attempt to keep Nashville's previous minor league baseball team, the Nashville Vols, alive as a fan-owned enterprise and whose family donated $25,000 for stadium construction.\n\nThe home opener for Greer's first tenants, the Southern League's Nashville Sounds, Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, was scheduled for April 25, 1978. Construction was underway, but Schmittou knew the ballpark would not be ready by that date. The team requested to open the season with road games and had to swap a series with the Chattanooga Lookouts in order to have more time to complete the stadium. Even with this extra time, the ballpark was still behind schedule. Much of the sod that been laid that winter died. By the time the replacement grass had arrived, the crew hired to lay the sod had left. General Manager Farrell Owens organized a volunteer crew to lay the sod by calling a local radio station to announce the team was having a \"sod party\". A group of approximately 50 people came out to lay and roll the sod the day before the scheduled opening game.\n\nThe scheduled April 25 Greer home opener was rained out and pushed back to the evening of April 26. After playing their first ten games away from home, and with tractors and grading machines still preparing the field on game day, the Sounds played their first home game on April 26, 1978. The 12–4 victory against the Savannah Braves was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 8,156 spectators. Southern League president Billy Hitchcock was on hand to witness the event, and Conway Twitty threw out the first pitch. On the field, Sounds catcher Joe Griffin led the 16-hit Nashville offense with 4 hits and 5 runs batted in (RBI) while starting pitcher Bruce Berenyi got the win and closer Doug Corbett earned a save.\n\nThough the stadium was opened on time, the late sod was not the only issue on opening day. The electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning, though a few portable toilets were also available. The stadium's seats, which had previously been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing home plate. The outfield grass was taken up and the soil regraded to alleviate this problem while the Sounds were away on an eight-day road trip.\n\nInitially, Greer was capable of seating 7,200 spectators, but was expanded to 8,800 by the end of the inaugural season. Theater-type seats with back support and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The press box included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25 people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330 feet (100 m) down the left and right field lines, 375 feet (114 m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405 feet (123 m) to center field. The home team occupied the third base dugout, and visitors occupied the first base dugout, with each team's bullpen located in foul territory in the outfield corners. Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100 feet (30 m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for customers at the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.\n\nWith the addition of 5,000 permanent seats, Greer's seating capacity was increased to 13,000 for the 1979 season. Improvements to the playing field included new irrigation and drainage systems which raised the field 5 feet (1.5 m) above its previous elevation.\n\nPrior to the 1981 season, Greer underwent a number of renovations including the addition of over 1,200 box seats and over 1,000 new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000 contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling the size of the reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's all-time attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315 people watched the Sounds defeat the Columbus Astros, 3–0. Portions of the outfield had to be roped off to accommodate the crowd, which was far in excess of Greer's seating capacity.\n\nFrom February through mid-summer 1984, major renovations and additions were made to the facility. A full-service restaurant, The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, and a mini-roof, to cover the last five rows of the reserved seating section and the main concourse, were built. A new press box included accommodations for additional members of the media, two separate booths for home and visiting radio broadcasts, and two separate booths for home and visiting television broadcasts. Ten sky boxes were built adjacent the press box; by 1989, the number of sky boxes had increased to 18.\n\nIn July 1984, Schmittou purchased the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association. The team moved from Evansville to Nashville for the 1985 season, upon which the Triplets' legacy was retired and the franchise adopted the Sounds' name and history, effectively elevating the organization from Double-A to Triple-A. The Double-A Southern League franchise was moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team began play as the Huntsville Stars at the hastily constructed Joe W. Davis Stadium.\n\nTo prepare for the move to Triple-A, renovations continued prior to the 1985 season with the addition of 1,200 box seats, which replaced some of the reserved grandstand seating, as well as more seating past the right field foul pole. A 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3.0 m) high replaced the stadium's original, which was relocated to far left field to serve as an out-of-town scoreboard, providing scores for American League, National League, and American Association baseball games.\n\nSchmittou's desire to land a Triple-A team was part of a larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a Major League Baseball franchise in the future. Along with this goal, the need for more seating, and a desire to make Greer a more attractive ballpark, significant renovations began after the 1987 season. The number of box seats was increased by 40 percent, the clubhouse and umpire facilities were upgraded, and the dugouts were entirely rebuilt. The new dugouts took up slightly more room than the previous ones, resulting in a minor contraction of the field's dimensions: 327 feet (100 m) down the left and right field lines, 371 feet (113 m) to left and right-center fields, and 400 feet (120 m) to center field. The main concourse entrance was redesigned to incorporate the stonemasonry of the adjacent Fort Negley. This expansion brought Greer's total seating capacity up to 18,000.\n\nIn 1990, Major League Baseball (MLB) team owners met to demand that minor league owners improve their ballparks in order to meet their desired standards. Greer had already fallen behind other parks when it came to the quality of the field and clubhouse, and it also lacked a weight room and batting cages. Following a failed bid to secure an MLB team for Nashville in the 1993 Major League Baseball expansion process (Nashville was one of ten cities considered, but was eliminated from contention very early in the process; the two new franchises were eventually awarded to Denver and Miami), Schmittou focused on scaling-back his proposed MLB stadium into a new Triple-A facility for the Sounds. At a time when other Triple-A cities were building new, relatively luxurious ballparks, Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for such a new park. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and explored sites in La Vergne, Cool Springs, and Mount Juliet. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40 million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium.\n\nGreer's distinctive guitar-shaped scoreboard, made by the Fair-Play company, was installed behind the left-center field wall prior to the 1993 season. Another addition in 1993 was that of a second team to play at Greer. From 1993 to 1994, the ballpark simultaneously served as the home field for the Sounds and the Nashville Xpress, the Double-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins which played in the Southern League. This came about when Charlotte, North Carolina, acquired a Triple-A expansion franchise in 1993, leaving the city's Double-A team, the Charlotte Knights, without a home. Schmittou offered Greer Stadium as a temporary home for the team. In order to accommodate another club at Greer, the Xpress scheduled its home games during the Sounds' road trips. This marked the first time that two minor league teams would operate in the same city since 1972, when the Charlotte Hornets and Charlotte Twins shared Calvin Griffith Park. \n\nThe Xpress played their first home game at Greer on April 16, 1993, against the Orlando Cubs. Pitchers Todd Ritchie, Mike Misuraca, and Jason Klonoski limited Cubs hitters to five hits and no runs in the 4–0 shutout. Nashville's Brian Raabe doubled in the second inning bringing home David Rivera and Rich Becker giving the Xpress all the runs they needed. The game was attended by just 1,715 people on a bitterly cold evening. In April 1994, Michael Jordan's foray into professional baseball attracted 16,842 fans to Greer to see the Xpress face his team, the Birmingham Barons, for the first time that season. The Nashville Xpress played their last home game on September 1, 1994, against the Huntsville Stars. With Nashville holding a 1–0 lead going into the eighth inning, Huntsville scored three runs in both the eighth and ninth innings on the way to a 6–2 defeat of the home team. In 1995, the Xpress relocated to Wilmington, North Carolina, and became the Port City Roosters.\n\nOver $200,000 was spent on renovations in the fall and winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce slippery areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500 feet (760 m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10 to 15 cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000 square feet (9,300 m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.\n\nThe 1996 season marked the last that Schmittou was the team's president and part majority owner. With the city prepared to welcome a National Football League franchise, which was to become the Tennessee Titans, Schmittou felt that revenue would be drawn away from his baseball team, so he and businessman Walter Nipper sold their 59 percent stake in the Sounds to Chicago-based businessmen Al Gordon, Mike Murtaugh, and Mike Woleben. The new ownership group, operating as AmeriSports Companies LLC, refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers in left field past third base were removed and replaced by tents and a group picnic area. This reduced the seating capacity to 11,500.\n\nFollowing the 1997 season, the American Association was dissolved, and the Sounds became members of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). As a result, Greer became the second easternmost stadium in PCL history behind the Indianapolis Indians' Bush Stadium when that team played in the PCL from 1964 to 1968. Greer was the easternmost active PCL stadium from 1998 to 2014.\n\nAs consumer preferences changed and in an effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.\n\nThe aging Greer Stadium had never been meant to last longer than 30 years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to attempt to come close to meeting minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds proposed a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, due in part to the Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks, avoiding taxpayer expense. The facility was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the plans for the new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1 million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer. The improvements, which included a new clubhouse for the Sounds and visiting teams beyond the center field wall, improved field lighting, and improvements to restrooms, walkways, and seating, were made in order to keep the stadium functional for another three to five years.\n\nMFP Baseball, which purchased the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2 million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed along the edge of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and the fourth-floor Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.\n\nIn 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office began working toward a new stadium, with the city identifying three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on the north end of The Gulch, the state-owned parking lot on the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the previous Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37 million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time for the start of the 2015 season.\n\nKnowing that the 2014 season would be the team's 37th and final campaign at the old ballpark, the Sounds launched the \"Last Cheer at Greer\", a season-long celebration of the stadium that included nods to its history and promotional giveaways to commemorate the closing. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds hosted their final game at Greer Stadium: an 8–5 loss to the Sacramento River Cats. In his only plate appearance of the evening, Nashville catcher Lucas May struck out swinging with a full count and the bases loaded to end the game. Announced attendance at the game was a standing-room-only crowd of 11,067, the first sellout since 2010, and the largest crowd since 2007.\n\nAfter the Sounds' administrative offices were moved to First Tennessee Park in early 2015, Greer became essentially abandoned. Vandals peppered the site with graffiti, and many of the building's windows and box seats were damaged. The playing field became overgrown with brush, and photos of the stadium's interior began appearing on the websites and social media accounts of anonymous urban explorers.\n\nLater that year, Mayor Dean expressed interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or a new city park, but, nearing the end of his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (Megan Barry, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal of asbestos. The department asked Mayor Barry for $800,000 to fund the demolition of the concourse and seating bowl so as to expand the green space at the property which could then be sold to private developers.\n\nProposed uses for the land included a soccer stadium, an indoor tennis facility for Belmont University, public tennis courts, rodeo grounds, a Kroger grocery store, and a neighborhood park. In a letter to the editor of \"The Tennessean\", former Sounds President Larry Schmittou expressed his interest in Greer becoming an amateur baseball park, citing its amenities and several Metro high schools that lacked baseball diamonds of their own. Two public meetings were held in September 2016 to discuss these and other proposals and ideas for the space.\n\nThe city's goal was to create a mixed-use development with green space and affordable housing. By April 2017, a special committee had narrowed the search for a plan and site developer down to five proposals. In May 2017, the Barry administration selected a proposal called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and backed by music producer T Bone Burnett. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-acre site included music and art space, a community center, open park space, and affordable housing. The footprint of the baseball diamond and outfield would have been turned into the Great Lawn, a green space accommodating amateur baseball and soccer. Renderings showed the guitar scoreboard and a portion of the outfield remaining wall intact. The plan, which awaited final approval by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, was met with concerns by citizens and groups whom preferred to see the property restored entirely to parkland and the site's Civil War history preserved. Other concerns were raised over the lack of transparency in the city's planning process and the privatization of publicly owned land. Cloud Hill's developers cancelled their plans in January 2018 after archaeologists determined that undisturbed areas on the edge of the Greer property, but not part of the stadium itself, were the unmarked burial sites of slaves forced to build Fort Negley. Mayor Barry expressed her desire that the site honor the history of those who died building the fort.\n\nFollowing Barry's resignation in March 2018, acting Mayor David Briley proposed the demolition of Greer Stadium and the reincorporation of the land into Fort Negley Park. He sought Metro Council approval for the approximately $1 million needed to demolish the stadium, the site of which would then be seeded over with grass. The Metro Historical Commission was tasked with determining a plan to convert the site into one which would honor its Civil War history. Demolition began on April 1, 2019, and was expected to take six months to complete. An archaeological team will survey the site before the land is converted to park space. The area may not be ready for public use until 2022.\n\nThe Southern League All-Star Game was held twice at Greer Stadium, first in 1979 and again in 1983. The July 12, 1979, contest pitted a team of the league's All-Stars against the major league Atlanta Braves. In the third inning, Braves pitcher Preston Hanna was taken deep for a home run by Columbus outfielder Danny Heep, and Nashville's Duane Walker added a run with his RBI single, scoring Memphis second baseman Tim Raines from third. Up 2–0, the All-Stars never trailed. The All-Stars went on to defeat the Braves, 5–2, before a crowd of 11,079 fans. Charlotte pitcher Larry Jones was the winning pitcher. Walker, who in addition to his run-scoring base hit, also drew a walk, stole two bases, and initiated a double play from center field by snagging a low line drive and throwing out a runner at home plate, was selected as the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP). Nashville was further represented on the All-Star squad by Geoff Combe, Paul Householder, Dave Van Gorder, and manager George Scherger who coached the team.\n\nThe midseason exhibition returned to Nashville on June 19, 1983. This time, the Sounds were enlisted to serve as the All-Stars' competition. Consequently, no Sounds player could be voted on to All-Star team. In lieu of this, the league chose to recognize all Sounds players as All-Stars. MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was on hand to toss out the first pitch before an audience of 1,221 who had waited out nearly an hour's rain delay. The All-Stars scored three runs in the sixth inning, including a two-run homer by Birmingham's George Foussianes, the game's eventual MVP. After rallying back with two runs on Scott Bradley's dual RBI single in the eighth, Nashville's Erik Peterson stuck out in the ninth with the tying and winning runs on base to end the game. The league's team had bested Nashville, 3–2. Jacksonville's Mark Gubicza earned the win.\n\nGreer played host to the Triple-A All-Star Game on July 13, 1994, with a crowd of 11,601 on hand in addition to live television and radio audiences. Players from all three Triple-A leagues (the American Association, Pacific Coast League, and International League) were divided into two teams, American and National, based on their MLB parent club's affiliation. Despite an early American League lead, the Nationals came back to score the winning run in the fifth inning when Tucson's Brian Hunter came home on a wild pitch. The Nationals won by a final score of 8–5. The \"Star of Stars\", or MVP, for the American Association was Nashville's Ray Durham who had three hits and scored the game's first run. Luis Lopez of the Richmond Braves was the International League's MVP for his three-hit, two-RBI night; Paul Faries, of the Phoenix Firebirds, was the PCL's MVP with one hit and two RBI. \n\nOther All-Star festivities included a Hollywood All-Star Game featuring celebrities Fred Willard, Jason Bateman, Barry Bostwick, Treat Williams, and Kristoff St. John. There was also a Home Run Derby with four of Triple-A's top home run hitters: Scott Coolbaugh of the Louisville Redbirds, Rich Aude of the Buffalo Bisons, Dwayne Hosey of the Omaha Royals, and Drew Denson of the Sounds. Each batter being given ten swings each to hit as many home runs as possible, Coolbaugh and Denson advanced to the finals with two homers apiece. In the final round, Coolbaugh won the derby by hitting six home runs versus Denson's two.\n\nGreer hosted 19 major league exhibition games in the 1980s and 1990s. Six were competitions between the Nashville Sounds and their MLB parent clubs, while the other thirteen were spring training games between major league clubs.\n\nThe first such game occurred on April 16, 1981, when the New York Yankees made a stop in Nashville to play an exhibition game against their Double-A Sounds. The 10–1 Yankees victory was played in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 17,318 people. Those on hand for the game included Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Dave Winfield, Lou Piniella, Willie Randolph, and Bobby Murcer. The Yankees returned for another exhibition game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. New York had a 4–0 lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but a five-run rally with two outs propelled the Sounds to a 5–4 win in front of 13,641 fans. The tying and winning runs came off the bat of catcher Frank Kneuer who doubled down the left-field line bringing home Matt Gallegos and Derwin McNealy from second and first. Among the Yankees in attendance for the game were owner George Steinbrenner, manager Billy Martin, coach Yogi Berra, and players Goose Gossage, Ken Griffey Sr., Dave Winfield, Willie Randolph, Bobby Murcer, and former Sound Don Mattingly.\n\nOn April 12, 1985, Nashville competed in an exhibition game against their major league affiliate, the Detroit Tigers. Manager Sparky Anderson's Detroit club included Kirk Gibson, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Rusty Kuntz, and Larry Herndon. The Sounds opened the game with back-to-back base hits and went ahead 2–0 on Mike Laga's RBI double. The game was tied 3–3 after five innings, but the Tigers outlasted the Sounds, scoring six runs in the tenth to win, 9–3, before a crowd of 16,182. On April 23, 1990, 14,012 fans attended an exhibition game at Greer between Nashville and their new affiliate, the Cincinnati Reds. Reds pitchers Danny Jackson and Ron Robinson held the Sounds to just five hits, three by Terry McGriff and two by Keith Lockhart. Luis Quiñones scored the winning run in the first when he came home on a misplayed ball hit on the ground by Paul O'Neill. Lou Piniella's Cincinnati squad shutout Nashville, 3–0.\n\nCincinnati returned for a second exhibition with Nashville on April 29, 1991. With light rain falling throughout the evening, the game was called after seven innings when the field become unplayable. Though 13 of the 16 Reds appearing in the game were 1990 World Series champions, including Barry Larkin, Chris Sabo, Paul O'Neill, and Randy Myers, the Sounds limited the visitors to just 5 hits and 2 runs while scoring a pair of runs of their own to make the score 2–2 when the game was ended. Rain also hindered an April 3, 1994, game between the Sounds and Chicago White Sox that was cancelled due to wet grounds and the fear of player injury, especially to top White Sox stars Tim Raines and Ozzie Guillén who were slotted to play.\n\nIn March 1996, Greer hosted eight major league teams competing in seven games across the span of four days in what was billed as the Nashville Baseball Classic. The Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos, St. Louis Cardinals, and Texas Rangers all visited Nashville as they prepared for the 1996 season. The Sounds played an exhibition game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 3, 1999, attended by 5,720 fans. The teams combined for 33 hits, including 9 home runs, in a game dominated by offence. The Pirates, whose roster included Jason Kendall, Emil Brown, and Dale Sveum, plated 13 runs in the fifth inning on the way to 16–15 win.\n\nGreer Stadium was the setting for eight no-hit games, including one perfect game. The first took place on May 16, 1981, when Jeff Cornell, of the visiting Jacksonville Suns, pitched a 4–0 no-hitter game against the Sounds. The second no-hitter at Greer was Jim Deshaies' 5–1 win over the Columbus Astros on May 4, 1984. In the second inning, Deshaies walked three batters and hit another, accounting for the only Astros run of the game, part of a seven-inning doubleheader. The third, a 6–0 win over the Oklahoma City 89ers, was thrown by Nashville's Bryan Kelly on July 17, 1985. Kelly allowed just one baserunner via a walk in the near-perfect game.\n\nIn a rare occurrence, the Sounds and the Indianapolis Indians exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights on August 6 and 7, 1988. First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo combined for a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0 Nashville win. Nashville won when Lenny Harris walked to first base, stole second base and third base, and then came home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong registered a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0 Sounds victory. This was the only time in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games.\n\nOn April 7, 2003, John Wasdin tossed a perfect game at Greer in a 4–0 win over the Albuquerque Isotopes. This was just the second nine-inning perfect complete game in the 100-year history of the Pacific Coast League. Wasdin threw 100 pitches, striking out 15 batters. Later in the year, on August 2, Colorado Springs Sky Sox pitchers Chris Gissell (7 innings pitched (IP)) and Jesús Sánchez (2 IP) combined for a no-hit 3–0 win against the Sounds. The final no-hit effort at Greer took place on July 15, 2006, when Nashville pitchers Carlos Villanueva (6 IP), Mike Meyers (2 IP), and Alec Zumwalt (1 IP) combined on a 2–0 win over the Memphis Redbirds.\n\nOn May 5–6, 2006, Greer was the site of a game which tied the record for the longest game, in terms of innings played, in Pacific Coast League history. The Sounds and the New Orleans Zephyrs competed in a 24-inning game, played over the course of two days, which lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes. New Orleans defeated Nashville, 5–4. The record was originally set on June 8, 1909, in a game between the San Francisco Seals and Oakland Oaks. A few years later, on September 10, 1911, the record was tied by the Sacramento Solons and Portland Beavers. The Sounds and Zephyrs set the PCL records for the most pitchers used in one game by both clubs (17), and tied the record for the most players used by both clubs (40). They set the records for the most strikeouts, batting and pitching, in a game by both clubs (48), the most at bats by both teams (166), and the most assists by both teams (53). The Sounds tied the records for the most pitchers used by one team (9) and the most assists by a single team (28).\n\nIn 1979 and 1980, Greer Stadium was the home of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) World Series. The Lipscomb Bisons of Nashville's Lipscomb University won the 1979 series, and the Grand Canyon Antelopes of Grand Canyon University won in 1980. Until the 2011 opening of E. S. Rose Park, the Belmont Bruins baseball team played the majority of its season at Greer.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Greer served as the home field for the Father Ryan High School football team. Father Ryan returned to playing at Greer from 2006 through 2008, before moving to a new school athletic complex for the 2009 season. In the football configuration, the field ran along the first base line.\n\nGreer was the site of the City of Hope Celebrity Softball Challenge from 1991 to 2014. Two teams of country music stars participated in the game, from which proceeds went toward the research and treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Participants included Vince Gill, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Billy Ray Cyrus, Sara Evans, Montgomery Gentry, and Phil Vassar. Through the 2008 event, more than $1.5 million had been raised. In 2015, the game relocated to First Tennessee Park.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Greer was home to the Jeff Fisher & Friends Charity Softball Game. Then-Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher and players from the team, past and present, competed in order to benefit local charities. Titans participants included Vince Young, Steve McNair, Eddie George, Frank Wycheck, Rob Bironas, and Keith Bulluck, among others. Tomáš Vokoun and head coach Barry Trotz of the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators also took part.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys, including Sounds' minority shareholder Richard Sterban, were photographed standing in the seats along Greer's left field line for the cover of their 1989 album, \"American Dreams\". In 2002, the music video for Steve Earle's \"Some Dreams\", a song featured in the motion picture \"The Rookie\", was filmed at Greer. The video, intercut with clips from the film, shows Earle and his band performing the song on the empty ballpark's field.\n\nGreer's distinctive guitar-shaped scoreboard was manufactured by the Fairtron Corporation and installed by the Joslin Sign Company prior to the 1993 season at a cost of $400,000. It was originally conceived as the centerpiece for a proposed major league ballpark in Nashville sought after by owner Larry Schmittou as a part of the 1993 Major League Baseball expansion. Originally painted blue with red and white trim to match the Nashville Sounds' color scheme, it was repainted black with red, yellow, and white trim to match their then-current color scheme in 2008, and was located behind the outfield wall in left-center field.\n\nThe entire scoreboard measured 115.6 feet (35.2 m) across, 53 feet (16 m) high, and 2 feet (0.61 m) deep. Individual components of the guitar were as follows: 60-foot (18 m) body, 36-foot (11 m) neck, and 19.6-foot (6.0 m) tuning key section. It was installed approximately 80 feet (24 m) above the ground. It required 243,155 watts to power its 8,179 total lamps, which were connected to 64,169 feet (19,559 m) of wire. The entire display weighed 35,825 pounds (16,250 kg).\n\nThe line score was displayed on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator were all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represented the tuning keys. The body of the guitar featured only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The scoreboard never had the ability to display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards were an analog clock and a temperature display. Surrounding the boards were four large spaces for advertising; the two on top were static, and the two on bottom rotated between three images each (the rotating spaces were covered with static signage beginning in 2009). High-tension nets covered the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board was a circular advertising space. This sign originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors at the time. By 2013, due to leaks in its exterior, the scoreboard's functionality could be crippled for a period of time following a rainstorm, rendering many of its electronic features dark.\n\nGreer's guitar scoreboard was not moved to First Tennessee Park when the Sounds moved in 2015. The Sounds organization installed a modern version at the new venue, capable of displaying high-definition video. The first design renderings of First Tennessee Park did not feature a guitar scoreboard. On April 22, 2014, at the announcement of First Tennessee's naming rights agreement, Sounds owner Frank Ward told \"The Tennessean\": \"The guitar scoreboard at Greer is staying at Greer. At some point in time we will share what our new scoreboard will look like, but it's too early in the process. We're trying to figure it out as we speak.\" Two months later, on June 20, 2014, Ward announced that a new guitar scoreboard would indeed be constructed, citing overwhelming demand from the community. As a part of the stadium's 2019 demolition, the scoreboard was sold at auction for $54,815. The buyer, AJ Capital Partners, plans to integrate the structure into the design of Outpost Nashville, a forthcoming mixed-use project on the site of the former Nashville Warehouse Co. at the corner of Chestnut Street and Fourth Avenue South, just blocks away from Greer.\n\nBefore the installation of the guitar, Greer's original scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular unit with a 2-line reader panel. In 1985, it was moved to beside the left field foul pole to make room for a new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3 m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard was not used to display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.\n\nSeating at the ballpark included fixed stadium seats, general admission bleachers, some with contoured seats, and eighteen skyboxes located on the third floor. As of 2014, total seating capacity was 10,300. Games could be watched from one of four picnic areas—one behind home plate, one on the third base line, one in the third base stands, and one beyond the right field wall. A rentable hot tub deck was located in the right field corner. There was a concert stage and family fun zone located on The Plaza inside the concourse entrance.\n\nSeveral concession stands and cart vendors were located on the concourse. A full-service restaurant known as Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill, constructed in 1984 as The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, was located on the fourth floor. The restaurant and bar was open during all Sounds home dates, and games could be viewed from the restaurant via windows overlooking the field.\n\nDuring their 38 seasons at Greer, the Nashville Sounds played 2,613 regular season home games. All told, 14,453,823 people attended their games; an average attendance of 5,532 per game. The park's season attendance record of 605,122 was set in 1990, while its average attendance record (8,108) was set in 1980. The lowest season and average attendances occurred in 1997 when only 269,186 people came to games; an average of 3,739. Attendance records from 1978 through 2014 are as follows.\n\n\nSpecific\nGeneral\n"}
{"id": "1986760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986760", "title": "Southside Wandsworth", "text": "Southside Wandsworth\n\nSouthside Wandsworth is a shopping centre in the district of Wandsworth in London, England. When it was built it was the largest indoor shopping centre in Europe and is currently the fifth largest indoor shopping centre in London after Westfield Stratford, Westfield London, the Whitgift Centre and Brent Cross.\n\nSouthside opened in 1971 as the Wandsworth Arndale Centre, and was the largest of the UK-wide chain of Arndale Centres with 110 shops. It occupies much of the town centre of Wandsworth, with five blocks of apartments above and the River Wandle running beneath, in a culvert. It initially included a mix of shops, offices and restaurants, as well as a market traders hall, although the latter has since been redeveloped. At one point it also housed a large nightclub, which closed in 2002.\n\nThe centre suffered a notable decline in the 1980s and 1990s, before being extensively renovated and relaunched in 2004.\n\nThe shopping centre is anchored by a Waitrose supermarket, large TK Maxx and a new Debenhams, although this store is now set to close. The upper mall contains a food plaza containing an Ed's Easy Diner, Ekachai, Frankie & Benny's, KFC, McDonald's, Nandos and Prezzo as well as a 14-screen Cineworld cinema. Two gyms also reside in the centre with a Nutfield Gym at the Wandsworth High Street end of the shopping centre and an easyGym on Garratt Lane. In August 2016 the Virgin Active became a Nuffield Health gym.\n\nA large branch of Sainsbury's is located opposite on Garratt Lane together with a Premier Inn Hotel and branch of Sports Direct.\n\nWith of retail space, Southside remains one of London's largest shopping centres in terms of its ground floor square footage (aside from the Westfield Shopping centres in White City and Stratford), and currently attracts around 8.5 million visitors a year. Redevelopment of the eastern section of the centre fronting Garratt Lane was completed in October 2015, with a £40 million project involving the demolition of office accommodation and the creation of a further of retail space.\n\nThe centre is split into three indoor malls plus a street-frontage along Garratt Lane.\n\n\nNotable former retailers include Tesco (who left in the 1990s), Sainsbury's (who moved to a larger supermarket on Garratt Lane opposite the centre), Woolworths (in a unit facing Garratt Lane which was demolished in 2005).\n\nThe site now occupied by the shopping centre was previously the Wandsworth Greyhound Stadium (which seated 20,000) and the Upper Mill (a large flour mill, damaged by fire in the 1920s and demolished in 1964). The Arndale complex was designed to be relatively self-contained, with few connections to the surrounding shopping streets other than service and delivery entrances, and value of the complex was maximised by the construction of five high-rise blocks above the main shopping area, and by building over a thousand parking spaces in multistorey car parks. It included a health clinic and a day centre, as well as a post office. Because it was built right over the River Wandle, it was considered something of an architectural and engineering achievement. However it was not universally popular, and its large size led to it being described by some contemporary commentators as \"one of London’s great architectural disasters\".\n\nAlthough initially successful (helped by being located at the junction of several major roads including the A3), it steadily drifted downmarket in the decades after its construction aided by the departure of its original anchor tenants such as Sainsbury's (who later returned to the area, but in an adjacent building) and Tesco. This, coupled with increasing competition from nearby centres such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Putney, led to a severe decline in the fortunes of the centre - at one stage it was said that the centre had seen the influx of so many downmarket shops that \"it's become hard to buy anything at the centre for over £1\".\n\nHowever Wandsworth was by the 1990s seeing extensive gentrification, and it was clear that the centre was in a particularly strategic location, with a large and prosperous ABC1 population on the centre's doorstep - many of whom were choosing to shop further away due to the lack of credible retail offer on their doorstep. To be successful, major national clothesware retailers rather than discount stores, physical improvements and a complete relaunch would be needed to provide Wandsworth town centre with a neighbourhood shopping centre providing a retail offer relevant to the shopping population of the area.\n\nWork therefore began to extensively refurbish and extend the complex in 2000. This included the complete demolition and reconstruction of the southern end of the structure, to add a new 860-space multistorey car park, a 14 screen Cineworld cinema, and a food concourse. A large Waitrose supermarket was also built, to anchor the relaunched centre. A glazed roof to the Central Mall was introduced to make better use of natural light (a common but now outdated feature of Arndale centres had been that the walkways were deliberately kept dark, so that the lights from the shops would shine out).\n\nThis redevelopment was followed by construction of a 23-storey residential development at the southern end of the complex by Barratt Developments. Wandsworth Borough Council refurbished the existing residential apartment blocks in 2003/4. The name of the centre was temporarily changed from Wandsworth Arndale Centre to the Wandsworth Shopping Centre, before finally being branded as Southside in 2004.\n\nSouthside is now owned by Metro Shopping Fund (a partnership between Land Securities and Delancey, which owns several other London shopping centres, including the nearby ShopStop at Clapham Junction). The centre continues to be progressively redeveloped.\n\nIn February 2010, work started to reconfigure the northern end of the centre, creating larger retail units and an enhanced street frontage, and linking with a major retail and residential development that is scheduled to take place on an adjacent site following the departure of the Ram Brewery from Wandsworth town centre. The smaller units in the North Mall were amalgamated to provide a large anchor store (covering let to TK Maxx.\n\nFurther development of Southside has been progressed in two phases. The most recently completed phase of the two phase redevelopment has involved the demolition and replacement of the centre's dilapidated eastern frontage along Garratt Lane to create of new shopfronts, In 2014 the Arndale Walk part of the centre was demolished, to create a department store unit and four additional retail units fronting Garratt Lane and four units on the junction of Garratt Lane and Wandsworth High Street. It was announced in October 2012 that the department store unit was let to Debenhams.\n\nRelocation of the Wandsworth branch of Jobcentre Plus (which occupied a four-storey office building above Arndale Walk, that needed to be demolished as part of the second stage of the redevelopment) proved to be controversial, with few alternative locations available, and opposition to the possibility of it being moved to a residential area in Southfields.\n\nIn the 1990s the centre was owned by Fordgate Wandsworth Limited (a large property company who at the time owned similar developments including the Pallasades Shopping Centre in Birmingham), and ultimately by property investors Moises and Mendi Gertner. Conscious that the value of the centre was declining, with the departure of both Sainsbury's and Tesco, and declining customer footfall, in 1993 they gained outline planning permission for a 10-screen cinema, expected to cost around £6.5m. The multiplex cinema would later become one of the first branches of Cineworld, whose Chief Executive, Steve Wiener had long known Mr Gertner.\n\nIn 2000, before construction work began on the redevelopment, Fordgate sold the centre to Portfolio Holdings Limited, a UK property company formed in 1993 which had concluded several town centre developments. Their majority shareholder was the Apollo organisation which managed several large property investment funds, based in the US. They acquired the lease of the Arndale Centre for £40 million with the aim of implementing the planning consents for a multiplex cinema, health club and associated retail units, with some modifications to the detailing, particularly to the mall entrances, mall finishes and lighting. Their financing came from German private bank BHF Bank (who provided borrowing facilities of £55m for the acquisition and redevelopment of the centre), plus their own resources and those of their American partners Apollo Real Estate.\n\nPortfolio used a limited partnership, Wandsworth LP, as a specific investment vehicle for the development. Wandsworth LP was effectively a joint venture between Portfolio Holdings, Apollo Real Estate Advisors and Deutsche Bank Real Estate's Global Opportunities Fund, and was used in order to meet the preference of their American shareholders for tax transparency.\nBetween 2000 and 2004 Wandsworth LP implemented a £75m investment in the refurbishment of the centre. The first phase was the construction of a health club on the Buckhold Road frontage (let to Virgin Active, now Nuffield Health), and securing conditional agreement for a 35,000 sq ft branch of Waitrose (who signed the agreement to lease in December 2001 as the first 'new' anchor tenant, and opened in 2004). They obtained a revised planning permission in 2002 for a larger and more extensive redevelopment than the previous Fordgate Wandsworth project, which included a 36,000 sq ft branch of Primark, an increase in the size of the cinema to 14 screens, as well as the demolition and reconstruction of the southern end of the centre including retail space and the multistorey car park, and a comprehensive refurbishment of the interior of the centre (aside from Arndale Walk), and implemented these plans over the following two years.\n\nOn 11 August 2005, Wandsworth LP sold the centre to Metro Shopping Fund for £188 million. The Metro Shopping Fund is a 50:50 joint venture between Land Securities and Delancey, formed in 2004, which at the time also owned several other London shopping centres including the nearby ShopStop at Clapham Junction. Metro Shopping Fund continued the improvement of the centre, demolishing the eastern side of the old centre (the Garratt Lane elevation), creating a series of double-height units within the centre on the Central mall (using previously derelict rooftop recreation areas) and bringing in further tenants TK Maxx, Gap, H&M Kids and New Look. Construction of retail units along the Garratt Lane frontage was put on hold, because of the economic recession in 2008, and plans were scaled down with a revised permission obtained for a smaller development that did not have residential apartments above the retail units. Metro Shopping Fund secured a financing facility to support the development of the two phases of the extension along Garratt Lane (the first of which is now complete), from Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank.\n\n"}

The condition isn't painful or itchy. But it can cause thick white or yellow scales that aren't easy to remove. Cradle cap most commonly begins sometime in the first three months but can occur in later years. Similar symptoms in older children are more likely to be dandruff than cradle cap. The rash is often prominent around the ear, the eyebrows or the eyelids. It may appear in other locations as well, where it is called seborrhoeic dermatitis rather than cradle cap. The exact cause of cradle cap is not known. Doctors think the condition is due to oil glands in the baby's scalp producing too much oil. Cradle cap is not spread from person to person (contagious). It is also not caused by poor hygiene. It is not an allergy, and it is not dangerous. Cradle cap often lasts a few months. In some children, the condition can last until age 2 or 3.\n\nCradle cap is seborrheic dermatitis that affects infants. It presents on the scalp as greasy patches of scaling, which appear thick, crusty, yellow, white or brown. The affected regions are not usually itchy and do not bother the child. Other affected areas can include the eyelids, ear, around the nose, and in the groin. Hair loss can also occur.\n\nCradle cap is not caused by bacterial infection, allergy or poor hygiene. Cradle cap is also not contagious. Doctors do not agree on what causes cradle cap, but the two most common hypotheses are fungal infection and overactive sebaceous glands. Cradle cap is an inflammatory condition.\n\nA common cause of cradle cap appears to be a common manifestation of biotin insufficiency. This may be due, in part, to the influence of biotin on fatty acid biosynthesis. Possibly it has to do with overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release a greasy substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry. There may be a relationship with skin yeasts (\"Pityrosporum ovale\", newly renamed \"Malassezia furfur\"). Seborrheic dermatitis is the adult version of cradle cap.\n\nIf the condition thickens, turns red and irritated, starts spreading, appears on other body parts, or if the baby develops thrush (fungal mouth infection), fungal ear infection (an ear infection that does not respond to antibiotics) or a persistent diaper rash, medical intervention is recommended.\n\nSevere cases of cradle cap, especially with cracked or bleeding skin, can provide a place for bacteria to grow. If the cradle cap is caused by a fungal infection which has worsened significantly over days or weeks to allow bacterial growth (impetigo, most commonly), a combination treatment of antibiotics and antifungals may be necessary. Since it is difficult for a layperson to distinguish the difference between sebaceous gland cradle cap, fungal cradle cap, or either of these combined with a bacterial infection, medical advice should be sought if the condition appears to worsen.\n\nCradle cap is occasionally linked to immune disorders. If the baby is not thriving and has other problems (e.g. diarrhea), a doctor should be consulted.\n\nTo help with cradle cap, parents can gently massage their baby's scalp with their fingers or a soft brush to loosen the scales. They may want to shampoo the baby's hair more frequently (no more than once a day), and after shampooing gently brush the baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel. Oil remedies can be used by rubbing a small amount of pure, plant-derived oil (coconut oil, pure olive oil, almond oil) on the baby's scalp and leaving it on for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, gently comb out the flakes with a fine tooth comb or brush. Be sure to wash out all of the oil to avoid making the cradle cap worse.\n\nIn cases that are related to fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, doctors may recommend a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or miconazole (commonly prescribed for vaginal candidiasis).\n\nDoctors may recommend a treatment with a mild dandruff shampoo such as Selsun Blue even though the treatment may cause initial additional scalp irritation. A doctor may instead prescribe an antifungal soap such as ketoconazole (2%) shampoo, which can work in a single treatment and shows significantly less irritation than over-the-counter shampoos such as selenium disulfide shampoos.\n\nThere are only a limited number of studies regarding the efficacy and safety of treatments for cradle cap and infantile seborrheic dermatitis. Several treatments including Promiseb, lactamide MEA gel, hydrocortisone 1% lotion, licochalcone 0.025%, flumethasone pivalate 0.02% ointment, and eosin 2% aqueous solution have been studied, however there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments.\n\nFor adults: see the article on seborrheic dermatitis (the adult version of cradle cap).\n\nIf the cradle cap is not severe, it could simply be combed out gently after bathing. The softened scales can then be brushed away with a soft brush, comb or cloth, but if not done very gently, this could worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. Applying petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning.\n\nThere is broad disagreement regarding the role of shampoos. Some sources warn against frequent shampooing, others recommend it. Mild baby shampoo is often recommended, but the exact denotation of the label \"mild\" in this context is not quite clear. Baby shampoos often contain detergent surfactants, perfumes, quaternium-15 and other eczemagenic irritants. No studies have been performed on non-prescription shampoos.\n\nIn stubborn cases some doctors may recommend keratolytic (dandruff) shampoos (e.g. with sulfur, selenium, zinc pyrithione, or salicylic acid) while others warn against the use of medicated shampoos in newborns due to systemic absorption. Dandruff shampoos often contain sodium dodecyl sulfate, a noted skin irritant.\n\nSteroid and tar preparations have also been used but may have drawbacks. The immunomodulators tacrolimus/Protopic and pimecrolimus/Elidel have not been approved for children under two years. \n\nKetoconazole shampoos and creams are currently shown to be the most effective medical treatment of moderate to serious cradle cap. There appears to be little to no absorption of topical ketoconazole into the bloodstream. \n\nTypical medical advice is to use baby shampoo, diluted with warm water, on a cotton swab to cleanse the eyelid. There is no agreement on the dilution, which ranges from as high as a 1:1 mix to as low as a few drops of shampoo per half-cup of water.\n\nAssurances that this condition will clear as the baby matures are very common. However, the condition occasionally persists into the toddler years, and less commonly into later childhood. It tends to recur in adolescence and persists into adulthood. In an Australian study, about 15 percent of previously diagnosed children still had eczema 10 years later. It is common that people mistake cradle cap for atopic dermatitis due to the common symptomatology. Unlike some signs and symptoms of cradle cap, atopic dermatitis affect infants' sleep and feeding habits with moderate to severe itching. In addition, one of the physical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is poor crusted lesions on certain surfaces of the baby, such as scalp and cheek. Rarely, it turns out to be misdiagnosed psoriasis.\n"}

It was released in July 1990 and is their first studio EP. This was a promo-only EP released on vinyl and cassette, and is thus a sought-after collector's item amongst Alice in Chains fans.\n\nBill Adams of Ground Control Magazine, reviewing Alice in Chains discography wrote; \"For anyone who was already paying attention to Alice in Chains by 1990, that the band was signed to a major label (they were the second (after Soundgarden) of the more mainstream “grunge” bands to get signed, actually) likely didn't come as much of a surprise. The band had the chops and a sound that could pass as similar to the metal of the day (well, at least some of the time), and they were at least as good as Skid Row, Warrant, Living Colour and Winger – who were all getting a lot of attention at the time – so that Alice in Chains would even get a cursory glance from the majors seemed inevitable. Upon signing with Columbia, Alice in Chains made it clear that they were willing to play ball on major label, mainstream terms too; for the We Die Young EP, the band selected three songs from their book which most closely resembled the swaggering, crotch-grabbing norm, and played them to the hilt.\"\n\nIn the liner notes of 1999's \"Music Bank\" box set collection, guitarist Jerry Cantrell said of the title track:\nI'd just temporarily moved in with Susan Silver because Sean [Kinney] and I had just had a fight. So I was riding the bus to rehearsal and I saw all these 9, 10, 11 year old kids with beepers dealing drugs. The sight of a 10 year old kid with a beeper and a cell phone dealing drugs equaled \"We Die Young\" to me.\n\nA CD version of the EP exists, however this only includes the title track and features artwork different from the vinyl/cassette version. The EP was a promotional only release issued before the band's first full-length album \"Facelift\" and has since gone out of print, with copies of the EP now fetching up to 100 dollars on trading sites such as eBay.\n\n\"We Die Young\" and \"It Ain't Like That\" were released on the band's debut album, \"Facelift\", later that year (1990). A demo version of \"We Die Young\" was released on \"\" (1999), the only song released on the compilation which was not available on \"Music Bank\". The studio version was included on the compilation albums \"Music Bank\" (1999) and \"The Essential Alice in Chains\" (2006). The version of the song \"Killing Yourself\" is exclusive to this EP; a faster-tempo demo version was later released on \"Music Bank\".\n\n\"We Die Young\" became a top five metal track at the time of its release. The music video was released in 1990 and was directed by Rocky Schenck, who would later direct the music videos for \"Them Bones\", \"What the Hell Have I\", and \"Grind\". The video features the band performing while various people drown in pools of blood. The video is available on the home video releases \"Live Facelift\" and \"\". An early music video for the song directed by The Art Institute of Seattle is also available on \"Music Bank: The Videos\".\n\nNed Raggett of AllMusic called the song \"two and a half minutes of pure heavy metal rampage\" and \"a masterpiece of arrangement and production.\"\n\nBill Adams of Ground Control Magazine panned the title track in his review of the EP writing, \"the EP's title track opens the proceedings with a great big thud\" also writing \"\"Killing Yourself\" opens with Staley howling like an ape before Cantrell does his best impression of Gilby Clarke for every note he plays during the song.\" Giving the EP an overall mixed review he wrote \"Without overstating the point, it goes without saying that the We Die Young EP wasn't the single greatest start for Alice in Chains. Simply said, it sounded like everything else on the radio playlists of the day\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986766", "title": "Lappet", "text": "Lappet\n\nA lappet is a decorative flap, fold or hanging part of a headdress or garment. Lappets were a feature of women's headgear until the early twentieth century, and are still a feature of religious garments. Examples of lappets are to be found on the papal tiara and on the nemes headdress of the kings of ancient Egypt. The same term is also used for similar-looking anatomical features on some animals.\n\nThe mitres worn by bishops and abbots of Western liturgical denominations, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, have lappets attached to them. \n\nThe lappets are probably a vestige of the ancient Greek headband called a \"mitra\" (μίτρα), from which the mitre itself descends. The \"mitra\" was a band of cloth tied around the head, the ends of the remaining fabric of which would fall down the back of the neck. \n\nThe Latin name for the lappets is \"infulae\", which were originally headbands worn by dignitaries, priests, and others among the ancient Romans. They were generally white. Mitre lappets are often lined with red silk.\n\nIn the Armenian Apostolic Church the lappets are not attached directly to the mitre but are attached to the back of the cope.\n\nSince early mediæval times each papal tiara has included two lappets. Their origins remain a mystery, though they are obviously an imitation of the lappets on the bishop's mitre. It has been speculated that lappets first were added to papal tiaras as a form of sweatband, with inner cloth being used to prevent popes from sweating too heavily during papal ceremonial in hot Roman summers.\n\nThe two lappets (, literally \"tails\") at the back of the tiara are first seen in the pictures and sculpture in the thirteenth century, but were undoubtedly customary before this. They were black in color, as is evident both from the monumental remains and from the inventories, and this color was retained even into the fifteenth century.\n\nPapal lappets on tiaras came to be highly decorated, with intricate stitching in gold thread. Often a pope who either commissioned a tiara, received it as a gift, or who had it remodelled for their usage, had their coat of arms stitched on to the lappets. Many later papal lappets were made of embroidered silk and used lace.\n\nThe last tiara to be used for a coronation, created for Pope Paul VI in 1963, also contained lappets.\n\nThe word is also sometimes used to refer to wattles, flap-like structures that occur on the faces of some animals. For instance, the lappet-faced vulture has lappets of bare flesh on the sides of its head.\n"}
{"id": "1986774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986774", "title": "Frame and panel", "text": "Frame and panel\n\nFrame and panel construction, also called rail and stile, is a woodworking technique often used in the making of doors, wainscoting, and other decorative features for cabinets, furniture, and homes. The basic idea is to capture a 'floating' panel within a sturdy frame, as opposed to techniques used in making a slab solid wood cabinet door or drawer front, the door is constructed of several solid wood pieces running in a vertical or horizontal direction with exposed endgrains. Usually, the panel is not glued to the frame but is left to 'float' within it so that seasonal movement of the wood comprising the panel does not distort the frame.\n\nFrame and panel construction at its most basic consists of five members: the panel and the four members which make up the frame. The vertical members of the frame are called stiles while the horizontal members are known as rails. A basic frame and panel item consists of a top rail, a bottom rail, two stiles, and a panel. This is a common method of constructing cabinet doors and these are often referred to as a five piece door.\n\nIn larger panels it is common to divide the panel into one or more sections. To house the extra panels, dividing pieces known as mid rails and mid stiles or muntins are added to the frame.\n\nThe panel is either captured in a groove made in the inside edge of the frame members or housed in an edge rabbet made in the rear inside edge. Panels are made slightly smaller than the available space within the frame to provide room for movement. Wood will expand and contract across the grain, and a wide panel made of solid wood could change width by a half of an inch, warping the door frame. By allowing the wood panel to float, it can expand and contract without damaging the door. A typical panel would be cut to allow 1/4\" (5 mm) between itself and the bottom of the groove in the frame. It is common to place some sort of elastic material in the groove between the edge of the panel and the frame before assembly. These items center the panel in the frame and absorb seasonal movement. A popular item for this purpose is a small rubber ball, known as a \"spaceball\" (a trademarked product). Some cabinet makers will also use small pieces of cork to allow for movement. The panels are usually either flat or raised. \n\nA flat panel has its visible face flush with the front of the groove in the frame. This gives the panel an inset appearance. This style of panel is commonly made from man-made materials such as MDF or plywood but may also be made from solid wood or tongue and groove planks. Panels made from MDF will be painted to hide their appearance, but panels of hardwood-veneer plywood will be stained and finished to match the solid wood rails and stiles.\n\nA raised panel has a profile cut into its edge so that the panel surface is flush with or proud of the frame. Some popular profiles are the \"ogee\", \"chamfer\", and \"scoop\" or \"cove\". Panels may be raised by a number of methods - the two most common in modern cabinetry are by coving on the tablesaw or the use of a panel raising cutter in a wood router or spindle moulder.\n\nFrames can be constructed by several methods: cope and stick, mortise and tenon, bridle joint, or a simple butt joint. Cope and stick is the most common method, as it is more efficient to manufacture. Mortise and tenon is the strongest, and is often used for large doors which will have greater stresses imposed. Bridle joints are typically used in less formal work, as the exposed endgrain is considered unattractive; while butt joints, being weak, are only used on very small assemblies.\n\nThe stiles and rails often have a profile cut into the inside edge of the outside face - usually a smaller version to match the profile of the panel. In some panel styles, a profile may also be cut on the outside edge of the outside face.\n\nIn modern cabinetry, the cope and stick joinery is achieved with a set of special router cutters. These cut the profile on the edge of the frame parts and also cut a reverse version of the same profile in the ends of the rail so that they may be slipped over the ends of the stiles and glued in place. If done correctly, the cope cut in the end of the rail will mate perfectly with the sticking profile. When glued together, the resulting joint will have sufficient strength for most cabinet door applications without further reinforcement. For extremely large and heavy doors, the cope and stick joint can be further reinforced with dowels, loose tenons, or by some other method. \n\nFor the other methods of frame construction, the inside profile is created either by mitred sticking or by an applied moulding.\n\nIn mitred sticking, the profile (known as the sticking) is applied to the edges of both the rail and stile and then a section of the sticking at the ends of each stile is removed leaving a mitred edge which aligns to a similar mitre cut on the ends of the sticking on each rail. This traditional method is more time consuming to complete, hence the popularity of cope and stick for manufactured items.\n\nWhen applied moulding is to be used, the moulding is applied to the inside edge of the outer face of the frame after the frame and panel have been assembled.\n\nThe process of making raised panel doors begins with gluing up panels, and then moves into cutting and preparing the frame parts. Next, the panels are cut to size and shaped. Parts and panel are sanded before construction. It is also common to apply a finish to panels prior to assembly so that raw wood is not visible if the panel shrinks. The joints are glued and set into clamps. If the frame and panel items are paint grade they are sometimes nailed at the frame joints on the reverse side. The door then moves on to finish sanding where it is brought to its final thickness, and the outside profile is added if required.\n\n"}

It states that a landowner may be held liable for injuries to children trespassing on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children. The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner. The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by abandoned cars, piles of lumber or sand, trampolines, and swimming pools. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property of the landowner.\n\nThere is no set cutoff point that defines youth. The courts will evaluate each \"child\" on a case-by-case basis to see if the \"child\" qualifies as a youth. If it is determined that the child was able to understand and appreciate the hazard, the doctrine of attractive nuisance will not likely apply.\n\nUnder the old common law, the plaintiff (either the child, or a parent suing on the child's behalf) had to show that it was the hazardous condition itself which lured the child onto the landowner's property. However, most jurisdictions have statutorily altered this condition, and now require only that the injury was foreseeable by the landowner.\n\nThe attractive nuisance doctrine emerged from case law in England, starting with \"Lynch v. Nurdin\" in 1841. In that case, an opinion by Lord Chief Justice Thomas Denman held that the owner of a cart left unattended on the street could be held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto the cart and fell. The doctrine was first applied in the United States in \"Sioux City & Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stout\", an 1873 case from Nebraska in which a railroad company was held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto an unsecured railway turntable. The term \"attractive nuisance\" was first used in 1875 in \"Keffe v. Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co.\", a Minnesota case. The doctrine has since been adopted in some other common law jurisdictions, such as Canada, but not universally.\n\nAccording to the \"Restatement of Torts\" standard, which is followed in many jurisdictions in the United States, there are five conditions that must be met for a land owner to be liable for tort damages to a child trespasser as a result of artificial hazards. \n\nUS states that use the Restatement test include:\n\n"}

Bruce Wayne (Batman) suffers burnout and is systematically assaulted and crippled by a \"super steroid\"-enhanced genius named Bane. Wayne is replaced as Batman by an apprentice named Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael), who becomes increasingly violent and unstable, tarnishing Batman's reputation. Eventually, Wayne is healed through paranormal means and reclaims his role as Batman.\n\n\"Knightfall\" resulted in long-term ramifications for the Batman continuity, as Batman's trust from the police, the public, and his fellow superheroes had to be rebuilt due to Azrael's violence. Additionally, Wayne realizes the peril and burden of attempting to work in solitude, leading to the eventual creation of the modern incarnation of the Batman Family. The events of \"Knightfall\" also led to the (temporary) resignation of Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth.\n\nThe entire \"Knightfall\" storyline took over a year to complete in the comic book serials. In later years, the comics were reprinted several times, though never in full, as the \"Knightquest: The Search\" story arc had not been collected until the second omnibus edition in 2017.\n\nThe initial idea for the character of Azrael stemmed from a two-part story idea pitched by \"Detective Comics\" writer Peter Milligan circa 1991, as he was leaving that position. After line editor Dennis O'Neil decided to expand it into a larger epic, he and the Batman line writers Chuck Dixon, Doug Moench and Alan Grant convened an authors' summit over a long weekend to flesh out the details and story points. At the same time, the Superman team was planning for a similar character-altering storyline, and neither they nor the Batman group initially had any knowledge of each other's plans. Dennis O'Neil denies the Knightfall storyline was in any way inspired by the \"Death of Superman\" storyline and states that it was already in development by as much as three years, saying that if the Batman staff had known, the storyline would likely have been pushed down a year.\n\nThe serial stories of the monthly Batman comics titles began slowly building toward the \"Knightfall\" arc several months prior, in conjunction with the publication of the four-issue \"Sword of Azrael\" miniseries and the \"Vengeance of Bane\" one-shot, which also laid foundation for the larger story.\n\n\"Knightfall\" ran from April to October 1993, \"Batman\" issues #492-500 and \"Detective Comics\" issues #659-666, with the two titles sharing a single narrative during this time. The two series each hit numerical milestones at the end of the arc, with a triple-size 500th issue of \"Batman\" and the ominous \"Detective Comics\" number 666 wrapping up the storyline only one month apart. The massive story was quickly collected into two volumes of trade paperbacks. Volume One was subtitled \"Broken Bat\" and Volume Two \"Who Rules the Night\". “Knightfall” was the first time that multiple Batman titles had shared a single narrative for an extended period since the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" era.\n\n\"Knightfall\" was immediately followed by \"Knightquest\" in the monthly serials. \"Knightquest\" is divided into two storylines, one following Bruce Wayne (\"Knightquest: The Search\") and the other on the new Batman (\"Knightquest: The Crusade\"). The stories were not treated as crossovers and the \"Batman\" titles continued as they had before \"Knightfall\" where the creative teams each pursued its own storyline. Instead of a crossover, \"Knightquest\" was more of an umbrella title that also encompassed some issues of \"\" (to avoid giving away their plans, the publishers treated it as though it were the new status quo, so issues were not numbered as chapters). Additionally, \"The Crusade\" served as a launching point for the first ongoing monthly series featuring Robin in solo adventures. Neither thread of \"Knightquest\" was collected in book format until over two decades later.\n\nAlthough previous parts of the \"KnightSaga\" had taken considerable time to run their course, the entirety of \"KnightsEnd\" was published within a two-month span, as the Batman books had to prepare themselves for DC's impending company-wide crossover \"Zero Hour\", which would immediately follow the \"KnightSaga\". Nothing was truncated, as the \"Batman\" editorial line made use of all of the Batman-related titles at their disposal, such as \"Catwoman\", \"Robin\" and \"Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight\" (normally an anthology title with stories set in the past). \"KnightsEnd\" was collected in trade paperback as \"Knightfall Volume 3\" soon after completion.\n\nThe serial nature of the Batman titles continued beyond the end of \"KnightsEnd\", with the \"Prodigal\" and \"Troika\" storylines, and into subsequent unbannered stories. This setup resurfaced in later arcs such as \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", and \"\", and has on occasion continued into the present.\n\nThe intent of \"Knightfall\"'s writers was to counter the then-popular style of violent heroes in comics and demonstrate that the traditional Batman made for a better hero. The issues featuring Jean-Paul Valley as Batman on the cover depict him with highly exaggerated musculature and legs which taper into disproportionally tiny feet, mimicking the styles of contemporary \"violent hero\" artists such as Rob Liefeld.\n\nThe prelude to \"Knightfall\" began with the introduction of two new characters key to its storyline in issues prior to the release of \"Knightfall\":\n\nThe two characters were quickly added to the cast in the monthly \"Batman\" titles, with Azrael being a superhero-in-training who fights alongside Batman, while Bane was introduced as a supervillain.\n\nWithin the regular series, the buildup to \"Knightfall\" begins with a six-issue run in \"Batman\" #484-489 (September 1992 - February 1993), in which Batman (at the onset of a personal psychological mid-life crisis) is forced to deal, in rapid succession, with the returning villain Black Mask and his gang (who target Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox), a crazed killer called Metalhead, and a sharpshooter assassin hired by an imprisoned mobster to murder Commissioner Gordon. Batman begins to feel that he has lost his edge, especially after his failure to capture Black Mask. He finds himself unable to meditate or even focus. As Bruce Wayne, he contacts holistic therapist Shondra Kinsolving for treatment. He also assigns Robin (Tim Drake) to train Jean-Paul Valley in detective work to aid them as an ally, hoping to guide Valley's brainwashing away from making him a villainous threat. Despite the advice of everyone in his life, including Dr. Kinsolving, Bruce refuses to rest and continues to pursue his self-imposed duty despite his worsening condition (although not explicitly noted as a cause, these events take place immediately after the death of Superman, Batman's peer, elsewhere in the DC Universe).\n\nThe next storyline, in \"Detective Comics\" #654-656 (December 1992 - February 1993), involves a young military student usurping power in Gotham's underworld and assaulting a police station, with Bruce's fatigue continuing to worsen. At the conclusion of this story, Bane and his henchman are shown monitoring Batman's performance.\n\nBane begins a series of encounters letting Batman know of his presence and his intentions. In \"Batman\" #489-490 (February–March 1993), Bane interferes with encounters pitting villains Killer Croc and the Riddler against Batman, and, to test Batman's limits, goes so far as to inject the Riddler with the Venom drug. This escalation culminates in an assault on Arkham Asylum in \"Batman\" #491 (April 1993), where Bane breaks the inmates free and supplies them with numerous weapons to escape. Meanwhile, Robin finds it difficult to work with Jean-Paul, due to the man's violent subconscious training and lack of social skills, and also finds himself being shut out from working alongside Batman.\n\nThe plot of \"Knightfall\" begins with the master criminal Bane freeing all of the maximum-security inmates of Arkham Asylum, a notorious psychiatric facility in Gotham City. Aware that he would lose in a direct assault against Batman, Bane's plan consists of weakening Batman by forcing him to deal with the deadly villains simultaneously. Among the freed inmates, there are numerous high-profile villains, such as the Joker (who trapped Arkham's administrator Jeremiah Arkham), the Scarecrow, the Riddler, and Poison Ivy, as well as many lesser-known villains, such as the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, the Firefly, the Cavalier, the Film Freak, Mr. Zsasz, Cornelius Stirk, Abattoir, and Amygdala. The scenario creates a rift in the relationship between Robin and Batman, as Batman irrationally seeks to face the outbreak alone—in later issues, Robin asks Batman if he is even needed as his sidekick anymore. A later flashback to this time period (\"Showcase '93\" #7-8) shows Batman pursuing Two-Face alone, being trapped and kidnapped to stand a mock trial; he is saved only by a rescue attempt from Robin.\n\nOver the next few issues, Batman becomes weaker and weaker as each criminal is put away. The rescue of Mayor Krol from the teaming of the Joker and Scarecrow pushes Batman to his mental and physical limits: a dose of Scarecrow's fear gas makes him relive , which he considers to be his greatest failure. After this encounter, Bane's men assault Batman before he himself makes his move and attacks him at Wayne Manor, his home as his alter-ego—long before this time, Bane had deduced the secret identity of Batman. The fight between Bruce Wayne and Bane is detailed in \"Batman\" #497. By this time, Batman is so exhausted from the exertion of catching the escaped criminals that he cannot even defend himself; Bane beats him mercilessly before breaking Wayne's back over his knee inside the Batcave below the manor, symbolically \"breaking\" Batman. Bane takes the grievously-wounded Wayne (still costumed in the Batman outfit) downtown to Gotham Square and throws him from a rooftop to demonstrate his superiority to the populace. Quick action by Robin and Alfred spares Batman's life, but at great cost - he is left a paraplegic. With Batman incapacitated, Bane assumes control of Gotham City's underworld and takes over several illegal operations within it.\n\nAfter his defeat, Bruce Wayne enlists the aid of Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to rehabilitate him and asks Jean-Paul Valley to take up the mantle of Batman so that Gotham has a protector. Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow Dick Grayson (the former Robin and then-current Nightwing) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. Bruce replies that Grayson has his own responsibilities and would only take up the mantle of the Bat reluctantly (Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman). Bruce's rationale for this decision is revealed in later issues - secretly, he does not want Dick to have to face Bane, as he knows Dick's character will compel him to try. Indeed, Bruce gives Jean-Paul strict orders never to engage Bane in combat—and when Jean-Paul does face Bane, only his modified gloves save Jean-Paul from being thrown to his death.\n\nSoon after, Kinsolving and Tim's father Jack Drake are kidnapped and Bruce and Alfred leave the country to find them - their story is continued in \"Knightquest: The Search\", while the happenings in Gotham are recorded in \"Knightquest: The Crusade\". Jean-Paul is shown to be a different, but not dangerous, Batman until an encounter with the Scarecrow, which results in Jean-Paul being infected by Scarecrow's fear gas and \"The System\"—his programming as Azrael—taking over, in order to combat Jean-Paul's fear. Following this, Jean-Paul is unable to shake the influence of the System, giving in to it completely after his first defeat at Bane's hands and being increasingly influenced by it during the rest of his tenure as Batman. Gradually, Jean-Paul alienates Robin with his paranoia and arrogance.\n\nIn \"Batman\" #500, Jean-Paul, in his new mechanical Batsuit (which is an amalgam of Azrael's costume with the Batman's) confronts Bane in an arduous battle and prevails, although many bystanders are put at risk. Jean-Paul leaves Bane broken mentally and physically, though he struggles with the choice of whether to simply kill Bane or hand him over to the police. He decides that he will let Bane go to Blackgate Prison. Jean-Paul continues to watch over Gotham after the fight, but grows increasingly unstable.\n\nAt the onset of \"Knightquest\", Jean-Paul Valley has been established as Batman, and Bruce Wayne is out of the country. Instead of a crossover with a definite ending, the publishers treated the scenario as though it were the new status quo, leaving it open-ended.\n\n\"Knightquest: The Crusade\" follows the story of Jean-Paul Valley during his tenure as Batman. He becomes increasingly violent and mentally unbalanced. During this time, he drives Robin away because he believes Gotham to be so tough that only violence could answer its criminals. In several issues, Robin is left horrified as Jean-Paul ferociously attacks common criminals, often with a weapon and sometimes nearly to death. This surge of violence from Gotham's defender puts pressure on Batman's relationship with Police Commissioner Gordon, who begins to distrust and even fear the new Batman and eventually comes to realize he is not the same man he has known.\n\nAll of Jean-Paul's actions are compelled by \"the System\"; on numerous occasions, he experiences the ghosts of his father and the patriarch Saint Dumas giving him guidance and he is driven to near-insanity by the time the saga ends. He repeatedly redesigns his Batman costume, adding more gadgets and lethal weapons, including metal claws, a laser, razor-sharp batarangs and a flamethrower. Eventually, he also adds a Bat-symbol, matching the one used for the series' logo. Valley becomes compelled by a desire to be a better Batman than Bruce Wayne, especially when he discovers his lack of interest in detective work caused him to make false assumptions about Catwoman (he thought that she would sell a powerful nerve gas to terrorists, when she merely wanted to dispose of it so that it could not be used to hurt anyone).\n\nHis questionable behavior climaxes when he encounters the serial killer Abattoir, who is keeping an innocent prisoner in a secret torture chamber: Jean-Paul purposely lets Abattoir die, thereby condemning the prisoner to death as well. Other villains Jean-Paul faces include Mr. Freeze, the Trigger Twins, Gunhawk and Gunbunny, the Tally Man and Clayface III and IV; the most notable encounters are with Catwoman and the Joker, both of whom could tell that Valley was not the original Batman.\n\n\"Knightquest: The Search\" follows Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth's search for Jack Drake and Shondra Kinsolving, the father of the current Robin and the physical therapist with whom Bruce Wayne had fallen in love during his rehabilitation sessions, respectively. Their investigation leads them to the Caribbean and then Great Britain. Kinsolving's brother-by-adoption Benedict Asp kidnapped her to use her special powers to kill people at a distance. Asp demonstrates this new form of mass murder on a small English village. When Bruce Wayne finds Kinsolving, he finds himself caught in the middle of a telekinetic tug-of-war between Asp and Kinsolving. The battle climaxes with her refocusing her energy to defeat Asp; as a side effect of the energy, Bruce's broken spine becomes healed. However, the drugs forced onto her by Asp, combined with the effects of the fight with Asp, reduce her mind to that of a child as Shondra's traumatised mind regresses to the past to escape her unhappy present, and Wayne reluctantly puts her into a mental institution.\n\nBruce eventually leaves England to return home to a civilian life in Gotham, but Alfred remains in England, not wanting to see Bruce Wayne damage his body further. He does not return to Gotham until a while later, when Dick Grayson persuades him to do so in later issues.\n\nJean-Paul Valley sees visions of his dead father, who had programmed him at birth to be a deadly weapon. These visions tell Jean-Paul to avenge his father's death, and Jean-Paul searches Gotham for his father's killer. Though the killer, Carlton LeHah, had already been encountered and defeated (in \"Batman: Sword of Azrael\"), Jean-Paul's conditioning had warped his mind to the extent that he no longer remembered the incident. He eventually comes to believe that Penn Selkirk, a Gotham mobster turned weapons dealer who has taken over the remnants of LeHah's organization, is his father's murderer. Valley now spends his time doggedly pursuing him.\n\nReturning to Gotham, Bruce meets with Tim. Even though Jean-Paul disobeyed Bruce's order to refrain from attacking Bane, Bruce is sufficiently impressed with Jean-Paul's results. Bruce decides to retire and allow Jean-Paul to continue as Batman. But when Robin tells Bruce of the circumstances surrounding Abattoir's death, Bruce sneaks into the Batcave and demands that Jean-Paul step down. Jean-Paul refuses and tells Bruce to leave the cave and never come back.\n\nTo rehabilitate his skills due to his lost reflexes after so long out of action, Bruce asks the famed assassin Lady Shiva to retrain him, using a mask to conceal his identity and arguing that she will do it for the same reason that she does anything; it might be interesting. After helping him regain the essentials of his combat reflexes, Shiva then pits Bruce against several vengeful expert martial artists, having killed their master while wearing a distinctive \"tengu\" mask that carries a motif of a bat that she subsequently gives to Batman. Shiva's caveat is that these attacks will continue indefinitely until Bruce Wayne breaks his vow to never kill. Finally, in the midst of an attack by the final martial artist, Bruce feigns using the \"Leopard Blow\" fatal maneuver Shiva had taught him, leaving his would-be assailant apparently dead. Shiva finally declares him worthy of fighting her at some point in the future, with Bruce only revealing his adversary's survival to Nightwing and Robin after her departure. Shiva would later learn the truth.\n\nNow back in fighting shape, Bruce returns to the Batcave and resumes his role as Batman. Along with Robin and Nightwing, he tracks Valley down to Selkirk's penthouse. Coincidentally, Catwoman is chasing the same man because he owns a neural enabler which might allow her paraplegic friend to walk again. Selkirk already wants to kill Jean-Paul for destroying a valuable weapons cache in Gotham Harbor.\n\nWhen they eventually all meet, mass fighting and gunfire ensue. The battle ends with Selkirk's helicopter crashing into the Gotham Narrows Bridge while Bruce and Jean-Paul fight on the attached Batrope; Jean-Paul falls aflame into the Gotham River. Bruce and Catwoman save Selkirk and his aides just before the helicopter explodes from the leaking fuel, his decision to protect criminals affirming to Catwoman that the true Batman has returned. When Bruce tries to find Jean-Paul using the Batmobile, it explodes due to a planted booby-trap. Nightwing fears Bruce dead and takes his vengeance out on Jean-Paul on a party boat. The police arrive in time to prevent Nightwing from committing murder, but Jean-Paul escapes. However, to his shock, Jean-Paul finds Bruce waiting at Wayne Manor; Bruce had managed to escape the Batmobile before Jean-Paul's trap destroyed it, reasoning that he would have done the same thing with a less dangerous trap.\n\nThe final battle of the \"Knightfall\" saga takes place between Jean-Paul Valley and Bruce Wayne in the caverns surrounding the Batcave below Wayne Manor: rather than beating Jean-Paul at hand-to-hand combat, Bruce outwits him by escaping into a passage too narrow for Jean-Paul to go through in his armor, thus forcing Jean-Paul to remove most of it. Bruce then opens a hatch to the outside, which covered the very hole he fell into as a child, allowing sunlight to enter the night lenses in Jean-Paul's helmet. After being momentarily blinded, Jean-Paul removes his cowl, sees Bruce standing over him in the original Batman costume and concedes defeat, saying \"\"You are the Batman... You've always been the Batman... and I am nothing...\"\" Bruce comforts Jean-Paul, who leaves to wander the streets of Gotham, homeless and destitute. Bruce decides not to take Jean-Paul to the police because it was his decision to make Jean-Paul the Batman, leading to his subsequent breakdown.\n\n\"KnightsEnd\" was collected into a trade paperback about a year later. Originally released as \"Batman: KnightsEnd\", recent editions retitled it as \"Knightfall Volume 3\".\n\nBruce reaffirms his partnership with Tim, resolving the tension caused by Bruce's unwillingness to accept help during the Arkham prison break. Bruce passes the mantle of Batman to Grayson so he can re-evaluate what it will take to restore his aura of invincibility. This begins the \"Prodigal\" storyline, a reference to Dick Grayson essentially being Bruce's prodigal son; Bruce had adopted Dick after his parents were murdered.\n\nBecause of the events of the entire arc, considerable time passes before Commissioner Gordon restores his trust in the idea of a Batman working for good. Gordon can tell that he is not looking at the original Batman (based on Jean-Paul's costume and Dick's height, and the fact that Jean-Paul was more than ready to kill people), and he refuses to place blind trust in a costume after spending so long learning to trust the man. \"Prodigal\" was utilized as a way of tying up the numerous loose ends that \"Knightfall\" left, with Killer Croc, the Ventriloquist, the Ratcatcher and Two-Face, along with many other, less notorious escaped inmates being returned to prison. In doing so, Dick avenges his worst mistake from his days as Robin, when a mistake in a confrontation with Two-Face caused a man to die and nearly killed Bruce. He also comes to appreciate the incredible physical and mental burden Bruce places on himself in donning the Batsuit. During the story, a firm bond arises between Dick and Tim as they share Wayne Manor together in Bruce's and Alfred's absence.\n\nIt is revealed later in \"No Man's Land\" that Bruce also used this time to set up contingency bases throughout Gotham.\n\nWhen Bruce finally returns for good, he wears a sturdier, matte-black Batsuit made of a combination Nomex and Kevlar (inspired by the costume of the Tim Burton \"Batman\" films), and drives a new, state-of-the-art Batmobile. He fights former Soviet agents Colonel Vega (who teamed with Asp in \"Knightquest: The Search\"), KGBeast, and Dark Rider, in order to foil a plot to nuke Gotham City with a device the size and shape of a baseball. (\"Troika\" is the Russian word for \"trio\".) The saga also shows how Batman makes changes to his life as Bruce Wayne, his relationships with his \"family\", plans to live without Alfred, and copes with the decision of making Jean-Paul his replacement.\n\nA one-shot that features the return of Alfred after his resignation during \"Knightquest: The Search\". It has Nightwing going to England in order to track Alfred down.\n\nA new series following Jean-Paul Valley was begun in April 1995, titled \"Azrael\". In it, he is found on the street by Bruce Wayne and given money to leave Gotham to travel the world and find his purpose, as had Bruce. His journeys take him to Europe, where he uncovers conspiracies within the Sacred Order of Saint Dumas which had brainwashed him. Later, he returns to Gotham City to aid Batman and the series was retitled \"Azrael: Agent of the Bat\" at issue #47. The series ended after 100 issues, with Valley's apparent death. Each issue was written by Dennis O'Neil. Azrael's demise occurred at the same time as the \"\" storyline, which focused on how Bruce Wayne as Batman interacted with his various friends, allies, loved ones, and enemies; oddly enough though, Jean-Paul Valley was neither mentioned, alluded to, or appeared during this time.\n\nThis crossover event involves a rematch between Batman and Bane, who is now allied with Ra's al Ghul. It is followed by the one-shot graphic novel \"Batman: Bane\".\n\n\"Batman Annual\" #22 featured the return of Arnold Etchison (Abbatoir)'s spirit, wishing to take revenge on Batman (specifically, Azrael-Batman) for his death. Now calling himself Etkar, he possesses Azrael's former Batsuit and returns to the site of his own death, with a hostage.\n\nIn \"Azrael\" issues #36-40, a final thread of the \"Knightfall\" plot is resolved in the four-part storyline \"Angel and the Bane\" and its following issue, \"Hour of the Quake\".\n\nAfter the events of \"Batman: Bane\", Azrael is tasked by Batman to track down the recently resurfaced Bane. After meeting, the two men struggle, and Bane gets the upper hand with the aid of a small band of Santa Priscan soldiers and his old henchman Bird. He restrains Azrael and injects him with Venom, with the plan of using him as a super soldier to take over Santa Prisca. Azrael is able to resist addiction to the drug and eventually conquers Bane and flies him back to Gotham City. They arrive just as the occurs. Bane attempts escape but is unable; as a last-ditch effort he unsuccessfully tries to convince Azrael to form a partnership. Instead, Azrael reaffirms his dedication to Bruce Wayne.\n\nThe cover of issue #37 depicts Bane breaking Azrael over his knee in a recreation of the famous cover of \"Batman\" #497, \"Knightfall\" part 11.\n\nEach story arc of the \"Knightfall\" saga ran across a number of Gotham City-related comics. This created a fairly complex reading order, which is summarized below.\n\nDC Comics published \"Knightfall\" around the same time as \"The Death of Superman\" storyline. \"Knightfall\" started almost immediately after the \"Funeral For a Friend\" storyline in the \"Superman\" books. During the breakout at Arkham Asylum, Batman and Robin both wear a black arm band with the S-shield engraved on it. The two stories involved DC Comics's most prominent characters. Similar stories followed for Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Green Arrow, with Green Lantern Hal Jordan being driven insane and replaced with Kyle Rayner, a new Wonder Woman being appointed by Hippolyta, Aquaman losing his hand, and Green Arrow dying in a plane crash as his long-lost son took over the role.\n\nIn the opening of the novelisation, \"KnightFall\", Dennis O'Neil stated that part of the reason \"Knightfall\" was written was due to the recent popularity of more \"ruthless\" heroes such as the Terminator and James Bond in films, as editors were starting to wonder if readers would prefer a Batman who was willing to kill his opponents.\n\nDuring \"DC vs. Marvel\", Bane attempts to break Captain America's back in a fight in a similar maneuver, but is caught off-guard when Captain America's shield returns to its owner to strike Bane in the back of the head and knock him out.\n\nIn the climax to Year One of \"\", Superman confronts Batman in the Batcave as Batman is downloading the formula to a pill that can grant the user superhuman strength and durability, stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. While Superman does not want to kill Batman, he chooses to paralyze him by breaking his back in a similar fashion to Bane (albeit by standing on Batman's back instead of slamming him over his knee as Bane did). This puts Batman out of commission for much of Year Two as he heals.\n\nIGN \"Comics\" #15 ranked \"Batman: Knightfall Part One-Broken Bat\" on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying: \"What makes 'Knightfall, Part One' so memorable is not the actually snapping of Batman's back. It's the quick fall into despair that proves most shocking. The ending is a foregone conclusion as Batman is worn down both physically and mentally. The Batman's spirit is broken before his vertebrae and that's a feat you'll never see accomplished anywhere else.\"\n\nThe bulk of the events in the \"Knightfall\" saga are estimated to take place in the 10th or 11th year of Batman's career by most reckonings, including official DC timelines. It begins within a few months of Tim Drake assuming the role of the third Robin. Dick Grayson's wedding to Starfire occurs very shortly after Bruce Wayne's injury. It is an election year, and Armand Krol is campaigning for re-election as mayor both before and after the story arc.\n\nThe initial scenes of the prelude miniseries \"Batman: Sword of Azrael\" #1-4 take place during the Gotham City \"Founders' Day\" parade.\n\nA meeting between Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne on his airplane is explicitly described as the first Post-\"Crisis\" out-of-costume interaction between the two.\n\nAs the contemporary Batmobile was destroyed in \"KnightsEnd\", the original Batmobile (with the large hood ornament) was used by Batman and Robin for several issues following. \"Knightquest\" also introduces Batman's rocket rail car linking the Batcave to the Gotham subway system; it was designed and completed by Harold Allnut after his discovery of the cavern passages in \"Detective Comics\" #650 (\"The Dragon\").\n\nIn \"KnightsEnd, Part 1: Spirit of the Bat\" (\"Batman\" #509 (July 1994)), Jean-Paul Valley references his defeat of Marvel Comics' Jigsaw during the crossover issue \"Batman/Punisher: Lake of Fire\". This is a very rare mention of a character from another company in a non-intercompany capacity, made possible by the insanity of Jean-Paul.\n\nIn the one-shot Tales from the Dark Multiverse: Knightfall, Azrael-Batman viciously defeats Bruce Wayne in their final confrontation. The storyline then jumps to 30 years later where Valley, who now calls himself \"Saint Batman, now uses venom to maintain his physicality (possibly to compensate for his aging) after killing all of Gotham's villains. Saint Batman also has Gotham burnt down and completely rebuilt as he isolates it from the rest of the outside world, which is hinted to have fallen into chaos. Jean Paul keeps Bruce Wayne 'alive' as only a head and torso in Wayne Tower, linked to a life support system. Jean Paul visits Bruce at Wayne Tower once a year and attempts to sway him to approve of his methods. Wayne is eventually 'rescued' by Bane's son and Lady Shiva. The son seeking revenge for Bane's death at Valley's hands decades earlier, with the two even providing Wayne with a new body made of nanotech. The three of them along with other insurgents, work to destroy Jean Paul's hold on Gotham, even persuading his own wife to turn against him by stealing his Venom supply. However, after confronting Bane's son (who's blood naturally produces Venom) and Lady Shiva, Saint Batman manages to defeat them in battle after nearly being beaten to death. Distracted while fighting Shiva and Bruce, the son of Bane stabs Jean Paul in the back and proceeds to break his back shortly afterwards. But after their victory, Wayne then kills Shiva and her son after they suggest restoring Gotham to its former glory. But Bruce refutes their suggestion, revealing that his years of isolation and torment have driven him to a point where he concludes that he can only rely on himself and that Jean Paul was mostly right all along. Bruce confesses this to Jean Paul and then hangs him up on a bat-sigil in the style of a crucifixion for all the citizens of Gotham to see.\n\nDennis O'Neil adapted the entire storyline into a 1994 novel which was released by Warner Books in hardcover form and then in mass paperback later on (Hardcover , Paperback ). A young adults' book version was also released, this one written by Alan Grant and titled \"Batman: Knightfall and Beyond\" ().\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1994, BBC Radio 1 broadcast a radio-play adaptation, later also released on audio-tape () and CD by BBC Audiobooks on March 5, 2007. It was adapted, produced and directed by Dirk Maggs, with music composed by Mark Russell, who had recently made \"\" on BBC Radio 5. This show, however, was not commissioned of its own, but rather to be three-minute episodes on the \"Mark Goodier Show\". This meant it was written with a sense of immediacy; having to make an instant effect and each three-minute segment contains a major plot development or sound effect stunt and end on a cliffhanger. DC acknowledged the effort in an issue of \"Shadow of The Bat\" by having villains jump past a sign that read Dirk Maggs Radio. The radio-play itself contained similar minor allusions to Batman - the host of a TV show called Chuck Dixon and Dennis O'Neil an author of a book.\n\n\"Knightfall\" was a sequel to \"\" also produced for BBC radio by Dirk Maggs.\n\nIts performers are:\n\nIn 1994, Kenner released the Legends of Batman action figure collection. This revolved primarily around Elseworlds stories and the modern \"Knightfall\" era; although it strangely did not include a Bane figure. The collection lasted two series and corresponded with the Superman: Man of Steel figure line based on \"The Death of Superman\".\n\nIn 2006, DC Direct released a series of figures specifically based on the \"Knightfall\" saga. This included Jean Paul Valley as Batman, Nightwing, Bane, Catwoman, and the unique \"Mask of Tengu\" Batman figure.\n\nPart of the storyline has been collected into a few trade paperbacks. Earlier printings of the \"Knightfall\" books had covers by Kelley Jones were under the \"Knightfall\" name and book three was under the \"KnightsEnd\" name (with this volume featuring a new cover by Graham Nolan and Brian Stelfreeze). These earlier editions also featured the original cover art/DC Comics monthly ads of the storyline as the chapter headings. The later printings of these three books do not have these cover/ads and solely title the three books under the \"Knightfall\" name with a similar cover dressing design. These new editions have covers by Mike Deodato.\n\nParts of the Aftermath storyline had been collected in a trade paperback:\n\nAccompanying the release of the movie \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in 2012, DC Comics released a new edition of trade paperbacks collecting the Knightfall storyline. While the 1993 editions omitted the complete Knightsquest story arc, the 2012 editions re-release \"The Crusade\" part of this arc in volume 2, leaving \"The Search\" part still uncollected.

Over 3,500 Standard Nautical Charts (SNCs) and 14,000 Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) are available with the Admiralty portfolio offering the widest official coverage of international shipping routes and ports, in varying detail.\n\nAdmiralty charts have been produced by UKHO for over 200 years, with the primary aim of saving and protecting lives at sea. The core market for these charts includes over 40,000 defence and merchant ships globally. Today, their products are used by over 90% of ships trading internationally.\n\nThe scale of the charts can vary according to purpose; large-scale charts often cover approaches to harbours, such as Port Approach Guides, medium-scale charts often cover frequently used coastal areas, and small-scale charts are regularly used for navigation in more open areas. A series of small craft charts are also available at even smaller scales.\n\nAdmiralty charts include information on: depths (chart datum), coastline, buoyage, land and underwater contour lines, seabed composition, hazards, tidal information (indicated by \"tidal diamonds\"), prominent land features, traffic separation schemes radio direction finding (RDF) information, lights, and other information to assist in navigation.\n\nNavigation charts at a scale of 1:50,000 or smaller (note that 1:100,000 is a smaller scale than 1:50,000) use the Mercator projection, and have since at least the 1930s . The Mercator projection has the property of maintaining angles correctly, so that a line on the earth's surface that crosses all the meridians at the same angle (a rhumb line) will be represented on the chart by a straight line at the same angle. Thus if a straight line is drawn on the chart from A to B, and the angle determined, the ship may sail at a constant bearing at that angle to reach B from A. Allowances for magnetic variation and magnetic deviation must also be made. However, a rhumb line is not in general the shortest distance between two points, which is a great circle. (The equator and lines of longitude are both great circles and rhumb lines.) When navigating over longer distances the difference becomes important, and charts using the gnomonic projection, on which all great circles are shown as straight lines, are used for course planning. In the past, the gnomonic projection was widely used for navigation charts, and also for polar charts. \n\nSince the late 1970s, all charts at a scale of 1:50,000 or larger have used the transverse Mercator projection, which is the projection used for the Ordnance Survey National Grid. Topology on Admiralty charts of the UK is generally based on Ordnance Survey mapping. For the small areas depicted on such maps, the differences between projections are of no practical importance.\n\nAdmiralty charts are issued by the UKHO for a variety of users; Standard Nautical Charts (SNCs) are issued to mariners subject to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention, while chart folios, at a convenient A2 size, are produced for leisure users. Alongside its paper charts, UKHO produces an expanding range of digital products to fulfil the impending compulsory carriage requirements of ECDIS/ENCs, as issued by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n\nThe digital range comprises Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) for use with an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), which can be displayed and interrogated through Admiralty Vector Chart Service (AVCS). The range also includes Admiralty Raster Chart Service (ARCS), which allows paper nautical charts to be viewed in raster form on an ECDIS.\n\nDue to the changing nature of the seabed and other charted features, chart users’ information must be up-to-date to maintain accuracy and general safety. This is ensured by UKHO through continually assessing hydrographic data for vital safety information, with urgent updates issued via weekly Notices to Mariners (NMs)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986817", "title": "Magnetic deviation", "text": "Magnetic deviation\n\nMagnetic deviation is the error induced in a compass by \"local\" magnetic fields, which must be allowed for, along with magnetic declination, if accurate bearings are to be calculated. (More loosely, \"magnetic deviation\" is used by some to mean the same as \"magnetic declination\". This article is about the former meaning.)\n\nCompasses are used to determine the direction of true North. However, the compass reading must be corrected for two effects. The first is magnetic declination or variation—the angular difference between \"magnetic North\" (the local direction of the Earth's magnetic field) and true North. The second is \"magnetic deviation\"—the angular difference between magnetic North and the compass needle due to nearby sources of interference such as magnetically permeable bodies, or other magnetic fields within the field of influence.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is modified by local magnetic anomalies. These include variations of the magnetization in the Earth's crust caused by geomagnetic reversals as well as nearby mountains and iron ore deposits. Generally, these are indicated on maps as part of the declination. Because the Earth's field changes over time, the maps must be kept up to date for accurate navigation. Short term errors in compass readings are also caused by fields generated in the Earth's magnetosphere, particularly during geomagnetic storms.\n\nIn navigation manuals, \"magnetic deviation\" often refers specifically to compass error caused by magnetized iron within a ship or aircraft. This iron has a mixture of permanent magnetization and an \"induced\" (temporary) magnetization that is induced by the Earth's magnetic field. Because the latter depends on the orientation of the craft relative to the Earth's field, it can be difficult to analyze and correct for it.\n\nThe deviation errors caused by magnetism in the ship's structure are minimised by precisely positioning small magnets and iron compensators close to the compass. To compensate for the induced magnetization, two magnetically soft iron spheres are placed on side arms. However, because the magnetic \"signature\" of every ship changes slowly with location, and with time, it is necessary to adjust the compensating magnets, periodically, to keep the deviation errors to a practical minimum. Magnetic compass adjustment and correction is one of the subjects in the examination curriculum for a shipmaster's certificate of competency.\n\nThe sources of magnetic deviation vary from compass to compass or vehicle to vehicle. However, they are independent of location, and thus the compass can be calibrated to accommodate them.\n\nNon-magnetic methods of taking bearings, such as with gyrocompass, astronomical observations, satellites (as GPS) or radio navigation, are not subject to magnetic deviation. Thus, a comparison of bearings taken with such methods with the bearing given by a compass can be used to compute local magnetic deviation.\n\nSailing ships generally had two kinds of compasses: \"steering compasses\", two of which would be mounted in a binnacle in front of the helm for use in maintaining a course; and a \"bearing compass\" that was used for taking the bearings of celestial objects, landmarks and the ship's wake. The latter could be moved around the ship, and it was soon observed that the bearing could vary from one part of the ship to another. The explorer Joao de Castro was the first to report such an inconsistency, in 1538, and attributed it to the ship's gun. Many other objects were found to be sources of deviation in ships, including iron particles in brass compass bowls; iron nails in a wooden compass box or binnacle; and metal parts of clothing. The two steering compasses themselves could interfere with each other if they were set too close together. The \"bearing compass\" was eventually sited in a fixed position in a binicale with, as far as possible, an all round view and acquired the name \"standard compass\" It would nonetheless have a different deviation to the \"steering compass\" so the compass heading shown on the \"steering compass\" would be different to the compass heading shown on the \"standard compass\".\n\nThe source of deviation could not always be identified. To reduce this source of error, which was due to induced magnetization in the ship, the surveyor John Churchman proposed a solution known as \"swinging the ship\" in 1794. This involved measuring the magnetic deviation as the ship was oriented in several compass directions. These measurements could then be used to correct compass readings. This procedure became standard practice in the 19th century as iron became an increasing component of ships.\n\nCompass Deviation is caused by local magnetic effects. On ships and aircraft the difference between North indicated by the compass, \"Compass North\" and \"Magnetic North\" (i.e. the direction of the Magnetic North Pole) is called Deviation. Variation is the difference between \"Magnetic North\" and \"True North\" and is dealt with elsewhere. The combined result of Deviation and Variation is called Compass Error.\n\n\n"}

Marble. He has worked at UTSI and held the Boling Chair of Excellence in Space Propulsion since 1991. Flandro has written or co-written 95 conference papers, most recently traveling to Kyoto, Japan to present a paper titled “Understanding Oscillatory Behavior of Liquid Propellant Rockets and Jet Engine Thrust Augmentors,\" at the Seventh International Symposium on Special Topics in Chemical Propulsion. He has also written or co-authored 54 refereed papers, four books and two book chapters. He has been named a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics on May 13, 2008.\n\nFlandro is an 11th generation pupil of Euler. The lineage is: Euler, Lagrange, Fourier, Lejeune Dirichlet, Lipschitz, Klein, Lindemann, Hilb, Bar, Liepmann, Marble, Flandro.\n\nFlandro’s work has supported decades of space flight and has led to successful missions to the outer planets. His research work with combustion instability in solid rocket motors has “practically solved a challenging issue that had plagued the field for many years,” said Vigor Yang Head, School of Aerospace Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology. Flandro has coauthored several textbooks including: \"Basic Aerodynamics: Incompressible Flow\" with Howard McMahon and Robert L. Roach of Georgia Tech, and \"Combustion Instability in Solid Propellant Rockets\" with Edward W. Price of Georgia Tech. It is in regular use in Flandro's short courses at UTSI.\n\nDuring the summer of 1964 at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Flandro was assigned the task of studying techniques for exploring the outer planets of the solar system. In this study he discovered the rare alignment of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and conceived the Planetary Grand Tour multi-planet mission utilizing the gravity-assist technique to reduce the mission duration from forty years to less than ten years. This work was exploited by NASA with the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions, launched in 1977.\n\nFlandro was recognized for this work first by the British Interplanetary Society (1970 M. N. Golovine Award), and later by NASA (1998 Exceptional Achievement Medal, with the citation: \"for seminal contributions to the design and engineering of multi-outer-planet missions, including the Grand Tour opportunity for the epic Voyager explorations\").\n\nThe ideas from this research have had major impact on subsequent solar system exploration; the Galileo (Jupiter satellite tour) mission and the Cassini (Saturn satellite tour) were made possible by the gravity assist method. Flandro (also in 1965) studied gravity assist trajectories to Pluto; these are the basis for the New Horizons mission launched in January 2006, which arrived at Pluto in 2015.\n\n"}

The line is important for cross-country passenger services, East of Peterborough, the route gives access from the Midlands to various locations in the east of England, such as , and via the West Anglia lines. It is also strategically important for freight, as it allows container trains from the Port of Felixstowe to travel to the Midlands and beyond.\n\nThe present route is an amalgamation of lines that were built by separate companies. The sections were:\n\n\nThe entire route became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1923 grouping, and the LMS was nationalised on 1 January 1948 as part of British Railways.\n\nMost Birmingham-Leicester passenger trains were taken over by diesel units from 14 April 1958, taking about 79 minutes between the two cities.\n\nIn 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of more of Britain's rail network. By 1979 BR presented a range of options to do so by 2000, some of which included the Birmingham to Peterborough Line. Under the 1979–90 Conservative governments that succeeded the 1976–79 Labour government, the proposal was not implemented.\n\nThe route was privatised in the 1990s as part of Railtrack and is now part of Network Rail.\n\nIn the 1980s, local services were worked by Class 105 Diesel Multiple Units and long-distance services, such as those between and , were operated by formations of Class 31 locomotives with rakes of four Mark 1 carriages. From 1986 the first \"Sprinter\" trains operated on the line, Class 150s, subsequently replaced by Class 156 \"SuperSprinter\" units from 1988. From this time, the service operated hourly between Birmingham New Street and with alternate services continuing to ( from 1991) or .\n\nCentral Trains operated the route from privatisation, and for operational convenience combined services on the route either side of Birmingham New Street, which created through services such as and to Cambridge and Stansted Airport and to Stansted Airport, although these were subsequently cut back - services to Aberystwyth ceased in 2001, although a few services continued to terminate at until 2004, whilst Liverpool was removed in 2003 to improve performance.\n\nThe service in 2016 consists of two trains per hour between Birmingham and , one of the two calling at limited stops to Leicester and continuing to Stansted Airport via , Ely and Cambridge, operated by CrossCountry.

In addition, EMT also operate an evening to Nottingham service which is worked by a Class 153 \"SuperSprinter\".\n\nFreight trains use the route between the West Midlands and the East Anglia, primarily container trains to the Port of Felixstowe and sand trains to King's Lynn.\n\nThis is a large project with a number of elements that will allow more railfreight traffic between the Haven ports and the Midlands. The work was prompted by the 'Felixstowe South' expansion at the Port of Felixstowe. It is also in response to the predicted increase in the number of high-cube (Hi-cube) shipping containers arriving at the ports that cannot currently be accommodated on the route. The percentage of high-cube containers is expected to increase from 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2012. Without loading gauge enhancement these larger containers would have to be transported by road or via a longer rail route via London that is already operating at capacity. Network Rail completed the gauge enhancement from Ipswich to Peterborough in 2008.\nWork will take place in three phases:\n\nThe work, detailed in the Network Rail Freight Route Utilisation Strategy, should be completed by 2014. at an estimated cost of £291 million.\n\nThe government is providing £80 million and it will also receive £5 million from Network Rail and £1 million from the East of England Development Agency. It has been estimated that the scheme would take 225,000 lorries off the road.\n\nIn February 2010 Network Rail confirmed that it would construct the 1 km 'Bacon Chord' in Ipswich to allow trains to travel between the East Suffolk line and the Ipswich–Ely line without reversing into Ipswich Station and to also perform work to increase capacity between Ely–Peterborough line at a total cost of £50m. It was stated that the work would 'take 750,000 lorries off the roads'.\n\nEnhancement of a section of the Birmingham–Peterborough line involving the reconstruction of 14 bridges, 11 tracking lowering/slewing schemes and one accommodation bridge. The cost is estimated at £40.5 million. The West Coast Main Line is already cleared to W10 and the route from Nuneaton to Birmingham is already cleared to W12. W10 gauge clearance was achieved on 4 April 2011 and GBRf trains requiring W10 gauge began using the route that day.\n\nThe Nuneaton North Chord was completed and opened on 15 November 2012. The chord allows freight traffic approaching Nuneaton from Felixstowe via the Birmingham–Peterborough line to proceed north on the West Coast Main Line without conflicting with southbound main-line trains. It consists of a one-mile chord from the existing flyover over the West Coast Main Line to join the line to the north. The cost of this work was £25.6 million. A Transport & Works Act Order for the Nuneaton North Chord was granted by the Secretary of State for Transport in July 2010. Work began in mid-2011.\n"}

Prophylactic moves are aimed at not just improving one's position, but preventing the opponent from improving their own. Perhaps the most common prophylactic idea is the advance of the rook pawn near a castled king to make luft averting the possibility of a back rank checkmate, or to prevent pins. \n\nIn a more strategic sense, prophylaxis leads to a very positional game, often frustrating for players with a strong tactical orientation. Players who play in the prophylactic style prevent the initiation of tactical play by threatening unpleasant consequences. One of the largest advantages of this approach is that it keeps risk to a minimum while causing an overaggressive opponent to lose patience and make a mistake. The disadvantage is that it frequently fails against an opponent who is content with a draw.\n\nIt should be understood, however, that any move which prevents an opponent from threatening something can be called prophylactic, even if this word would not be used to describe the player's style. For example, Mikhail Tal and Garry Kasparov frequently played the move h3 in the Ruy Lopez—a prophylactic move intended to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 and creating an irritating pin on the knight at f3—yet neither player would ever be described as playing in the prophylactic style.

Even by the standards of its time and class, the car consumed copious volumes of fuel, but Maserati fitted the car with two independent fuel tanks, which could be filled via flaps on either side of the roof pillars.\n\nThe Ghibli name was resurrected with the unveiling of the 1992 Ghibli (\"Tipo AM336\"), a two-door, four-seater coupé offered with twin-turbocharged V6 engines. Like the V8 Shamal flagship, it was an evolution of the previous Biturbo coupés; interior and basic bodyshell were carried over from the Biturbo.\n\nThe Ghibli was launched at the 62nd Turin Motor Show in April 1992. The Ghibli was powered by updated 24-valve twin-turbocharged engines which had seen use on the Biturbo range: a 2.0-litre V6 coupled to a six-speed manual transmission for the Italian market, and a 2.8-litre V6 for export, at first coupled with a 5-speed manual, then from 1995 with the 6-speed manual. A 4-speed automatic was optional.\nThe coupé was built for luxury as well as performance, and its interior featured Connolly leather upholstery and burr elm trim.\n\nAt the 1994 Geneva Motor Show, Maserati launched an updated Ghibli. A refreshed interior, new wing mirrors, wider and larger 17-inch alloy wheels of a new design, fully adjustable electronic suspension and ABS brakes were added. The Ghibli Open Cup single-make racing car was announced in late 1994.\n\nTwo sport versions were introduced in 1995. The first was the Ghibli Kit Sportivo, whose namesake handling kit included wider tyres on OZ \"Futura III\" split-rim wheels, specific springs, dampers and anti-roll bars. The second was the limited edition Ghibli Cup, which brought some features of the Open Cup racer into a road-going model; it debuted at the December 1995 Bologna Motor Show. It has a engine rated at .\n\nAt the time the Ghibli Cup had the highest ever specific power output of any street legal car at per litre, surpassing the Bugatti EB110 and Jaguar XJ220. Chassis upgrades included tweaked suspension and Brembo brakes. \nVisually the Cup was recognisable from its 5-spoke split-rim Speedline wheels and badges on the doors. Only four exterior colours were available: red, white, yellow and French blue. The sporty theme continued in the Cup's cabin with black leather, carbon fibre trim, aluminium pedals and a MOMO steering wheel.\n\nA second round of improvements resulted in the Ghibli GT in 1996. It was fitted with 7-spoke 17\" alloy wheels, black headlight housings, and had suspension and transmission modifications.\n\nOn 4 November 1996 on the Lake Lugano, Guido Cappellini broke the flying kilometre's World Speed Record on water in the 5-litre class, piloting a composite-hulled speedboat powered by the biturbo V6 from the Ghibli Cup and belonging to Bruno Abbate's Primatist/Special Team. The boat ran the kilometre at an average speed of .\nTo celebrate the world record Maserati made 60 special edition Ghiblis called the Ghibli Primatist, featuring special Ultramarine blue paintwork and an interior trimmed in two-tone blue/turquoise leather and polished burr walnut trim.\n\nProduction of the second generation Ghibli ended in Summer 1998. It was replaced in the Maserati range by the 3200 GT.\n\nA single-make racing series for the Ghibli, the Open Cup, was run two seasons—1995 and 1996. Twenty-five Ghibli Open Cup racing cars were prepared. They were based on the two-litre model, with their engines tuned to by using roller-bearing turbochargers, a freer-flowing exhaust, and remapped fuel computers; a roll cage, Sparco racing seats, a Momo racing steering wheel, aluminium shifter knob and pedals, 5-point belts, automatic fire extinguishing system, an aluminium sump guard, carbon fibre air-intakes, a modified fuel system and 17-inch 5-spoke Speedline wheels completed the outfitting.\nIn 1995 eight races were held, two in Italy and six across Europe.\nIn 1996, the car received a modification upgrade, resulting in similar track times to those of the Ferrari 355 Challenge. After the end of the 1995 racing season, several of the original 23 cars were used in national GT events.\n\nLike the Biturbo, the Ghibli had unibody steel construction, with a conventional longitudinally-mounted, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Suspension was of the MacPherson strut type at the front and semi-trailing arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on both axles. The differential and rear suspension arms were supported by a bushing-insulated subframe. It also featured ventilated disc brakes on all four wheels, and steering was servo-assisted rack and pinion.\n\nThe engine was the latest evolution of Maserati's all-aluminium alloy, DOHC 4 valves per cylinder 90° V6 engine, fitted with water-cooled IHI twin-turbochargers and two air-to-air intercoolers, one per each cylinder bank. Weber-Magneti Marelli IAW electronic fuel injection and ignition system was used. The gearbox was a Getrag-supplied 6-speed manual transmission from the Shamal on 2-litre cars, while 2.8 litre cars initially used a 5-speed ZF unit and were update with the Getrag gearbox in 1995. At the rear axle there was Maserati's \"Ranger\" Torsen limited slip differential from the Biturbo, with an added oil cooler.\n\nThe current third generation of the Ghibli (\"Tipo M157\") was unveiled at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show.\nThe Ghibli is offered with three different 3.0-litre V6 engines: a twin-turbocharged or petrol and a turbodiesel, making the Ghibli the first Maserati production car to be powered by a diesel engine.\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission is standard on all models; all wheel drive is available with the most powerful V6, although not in right hand drive markets.\n\n"}

The album was released on 15 June 2005 in Japan, 20 June 2005 in the United Kingdom, 21 July 2005 in Australia and 20 September 2005 in the United States.\n\nThe album was released after the 2004 movie \"Napoleon Dynamite\" featured the Jamiroquai song \"Canned Heat\" in its climactic dance scene. \"Feels Just Like It Should\" was the first single, reaching No. 8 in its first week on the UK charts. It has since become a No.1 hit on the \"Billboard\" dance charts in the United States. The single was also certified Gold in Japan for selling 100,000 copies. The second single, \"Seven Days in Sunny June\", was released in the UK in August 2005, peaking at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. The song also featured in the film \"The Devil Wears Prada\". On 7 November 2005, \"(Don't) Give Hate A Chance\" was released as the third single from the album. The politically driven video for the track, which can be seen in its entirety at the band's website, is Jamiroquai's first animated clip; it features a Buffalo Man, complete with buffalo-horned hat, sunglasses, and tracksuit. The clip helped the track score Top 20 showings in UK charts such as the Smash Hits and hit40uk charts, both of which take in radio and video airplay, not just sales. However, the track bowed meekly at No.27 on the official UK singles chart. The album was recorded in many locations, including Jay's personal Chillington Studios.\n\nThe album peaked at No.3 in the United Kingdom, becoming the first Jamiroquai album to chart outside the top two spots. \"Uncut\" gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, claiming \"Jay Kay returns with another blast of super-slick soul...\" \"Vibe\" wrote that \"The space cowboys return with a vengeance, sounding funky as ever.\"\n\n\n\n\nNote: \"Time Won't Wait\" was not on the initial European and Australian release. On most regions, it was later added as a standard track. Additionally, all test pressings of the album include the track \"Beatbox\" (2:34) as Track 12.\n\nAdapted credits from the liner notes of \"Dynamite\".\n"}

Ian McCulloch has said: \"When I sing \"The Killing Moon\", I know there isn't a band in the world who's got a song anywhere near that\".\nIn a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic journalist Stewart Mason wrote: \"The smart use of strings amplifies the elegance of the tune, bringing both a musical richness and a sense of quiet dignity to the tune\".\n\nAccording to the liner notes of Echo and the Bunnymen's \"Crystal Days\" box set, Ian McCulloch woke up one morning with the phrase \"fate up against your will\" in mind. In a 2015 interview McCulloch said: \"I love (the song) all the more because I didn’t pore over it for days on end. One morning, I just sat bolt upright in bed with this line in my head: 'Fate up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until you give yourself to him.' You don’t dream things like that and remember them. That’s why I’ve always half credited the lyric to God. It’s never happened before or since\". McCulloch attributed the use of astronomical imagery in the song to a childhood interest in space.\n\nThe chords of the song were based on David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\", played backwards. The arrangement of the song was partially inspired by balalaika music that Les Pattinson and Will Sergeant had heard in Russia. The guitar solo had been recorded separately by Sergeant whilst tuning up and was inserted in the song at the suggestion of producer David Lord.

{"id": "1986891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986891", "title": "Comparison of Pascal and C", "text": "Comparison of Pascal and C\n\nThe computer programming languages C and Pascal have similar times of origin, influences, and purposes. Both were used to design (and compile) their own compilers early in their lifetimes. The original Pascal definition appeared in 1969 and a first compiler in 1970. The first version of C appeared in 1972.\n\nBoth are descendants of the ALGOL language series. ALGOL introduced programming language support for structured programming, where programs are constructed of single entry and single exit constructs such as if, while, for and case. Pascal stems directly from ALGOL W, while it shared some new ideas with ALGOL 68. The C language is more indirectly related to ALGOL, originally through B, BCPL, and CPL, and later through ALGOL 68 (for example in case of codice_1 and codice_2) and also Pascal (for example in case of enumerations, codice_3, codice_4 and booleans). Some Pascal dialects also incorporated traits from C.\n\nThe languages documented here are the Pascal of Niklaus Wirth, as standardized as ISO 7185 in 1982, and the C of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, as standardized in 1989. The reason is that these versions both represent the mature version of the language, and also because they are comparatively close in time. ANSI C and C99 (the later C standards) features, and features of later implementations of Pascal (Turbo Pascal, Free Pascal) are not included in the comparison, despite the improvements in robustness and functionality that they conferred.\n\nSyntactically, Pascal is much more ALGOL-like than C. English keywords are retained where C uses punctuation symbols – Pascal has codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7 where C uses codice_8, codice_9, and codice_10 for example. However, C is more ALGOL-like than Pascal regarding (simple) declarations, retaining the \"type-name\" \"variable-name\" syntax. For example, C can accept declarations at the start of any block, not just the outer block of a function.\n\nAnother, more subtle, difference is the role of the semicolon. In Pascal, semicolons \"separate\" individual statements within a compound statement; instead in C, they \"terminate\" the statement. In C, they are also syntactically part of the statement (transforming an expression into a statement). This difference manifests mainly in two situations:\n\n\nA superfluous semicolon can be put on the last line before end, thereby formally inserting an \"empty statement\".\n\nIn traditional C, there are only codice_14. This is only supported by certain Pascal dialects like MIDletPascal.\n\nIn traditional Pascal, there are codice_15 and codice_16.\nModern Pascal, like Object Pascal (Delphi, FPC), as well as modern C implementations allow C++ style comments codice_17\n\nC and Pascal differ in their interpretation of upper and lower case. C is case sensitive while Pascal is not, thus codice_18 and codice_19 are distinct names in C but identical in Pascal. In both languages, identifiers consist of letters and digits, with the rule that the first character may not be a digit. In C, the underscore counts as a letter, so even _abc is a valid name. Names with a leading underscore are often used to differentiate special system identifiers in C.\n\nBoth C and Pascal use keywords (words reserved for use by the language). Examples are if, while, const, for and goto, which are keywords that happen to be common to both languages. In C, the basic built-in type names are also keywords (e.g., int, char) or combinations of keywords (e.g., unsigned char), while in Pascal the built-in type names are predefined normal identifiers.\n\nIn Pascal, procedure definitions start with keywords procedure or function and type definitions with type. In C, function definitions are determined by syntactical context while type definitions use the keyword codice_4. Both languages use a mix of keywords and punctuation for definitions of complex types; for instance, arrays are defined by the keyword array in Pascal and by punctuation in C, while enumerations are defined by the keyword codice_21 in C but by punctuation in Pascal.\n\nIn Pascal functions, begin and end delimit a block of statements (proper), while C functions use \"{\" and \"}\" to delimit a block of statements optionally preceded by declarations. C (before C99) strictly defines that any declarations must occur \"before\" the statements within a particular block but allows blocks to appear within blocks, which is a way to go around this. Pascal is strict that declarations must occur before statements, but allows \"definitions\" of types and functions - not only variable declarations - to be encapsulated by function definitions to any level of depth.\n\nThe grammars of both languages are of a similar size. From an implementation perspective the main difference between the two languages is that to parse C it is necessary to have access to a symbol table for types, while in Pascal there is only one such construct, assignment. For instance, the C fragment codice_22 could be a declaration of codice_23 to be an object whose type is pointer to codice_24, or a statement-expression that multiplies codice_24 and codice_23. In contrast, the corresponding Pascal fragment codice_27 is inherently unambiguous; correct parsing does not require a symbol table.\n\nPascal requires all variable and function declarations to specify their type explicitly. In traditional C, a type name may be omitted in most contexts and the default type codice_28 (which corresponds to codice_29 in Pascal) is then implicitly assumed (however, such defaults are considered bad practice in C and are often flagged by warnings).\n\nC accommodates different sizes and signed and unsigned modes for integers by using modifiers such as codice_30, codice_31, codice_32, codice_33, etc. The exact meaning of the resulting integer type is machine-dependent, however, what \"can\" be guaranteed is that codice_34 is at least 16 bits, codice_35 is no shorter than codice_28 and codice_37 is no longer than codice_28.\n\nIn Pascal, a similar end is performed by declaring a \"subrange\" of integer (a compiler may then choose to allocate a smaller amount of storage for the declared variable):\ntype a = 1..100;\nThis subrange feature is not supported by C.\n\nA major, if subtle, difference between C and Pascal is how they promote integer operations. In Pascal, the result of an operation is defined for all integer/subrange types, even if intermediate results do not fit into an integer. The result is undefined only if it does not fit into the integer/subrange on the left hand side of the assignment. This may imply an artificial restriction on the range of integer types, or may require slow execution to handle the intermediate results: However, the compiler may take advantage of restricted subranges to produce more efficient code.\n\nIn C, operands must first be promoted to the size of the required result: intermediate results are undefined if they do not fit into the range of the promoted operands. If range of the required result is greater than the range of operands, this normally produces slow inefficient code, even from a good optimising compiler. However, a C compiler is never required or expected to handle out of range intermediate results: it is the programmers responsibility to ensure that all intermediate results fit into the operand range.\n\nThe (only) pre-Standard implementation of C as well as Small-C et al. allowed integer and pointer types to be relatively freely intermixed.\n\nIn C the character type is codice_39 which is a kind of integer that is no longer than codice_37, . Expressions such as codice_41 are therefore perfectly legal, as are declarations such as codice_42 and codice_43.\n\nThis integer nature of codice_39 (one byte) is clearly illustrated by declarations such as\n\nunsigned char uc = 255; /* common limit */\nsigned char sc = -128; /* common negative limit */\nWhether the codice_39 type should be regarded as codice_32 or codice_33 by default is up to the implementation.\n\nIn Pascal, characters and integers are distinct types. The inbuilt compiler functions codice_48 and codice_49 can be used to typecast single characters to the corresponding integer value of the character set in use, and vice versa. e.g. on systems using the ASCII character set codice_50 and codice_51 is a TAB character.\n\nIn Pascal, boolean is an enumerated type. The possible values of boolean are false and true. For conversion to integer, ord is used:\ni := ord(b);\nThere is no standard function for integer to boolean, however, the conversion is simple in practice:\nb := i <> 0;\nC has binary valued relational operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=) which may be regarded as \"boolean\" in the sense that they always give results which are either zero or one. As all tests (&&, ||, ?:, if, while, etc.) are performed by zero-checks, false is represented by zero, while true is represented by any other value.\n\nC allows using bitwise operators to perform boolean operations. Care must be taken because the semantics are different when operands make use of more than one bit to represent a value.\n\nPascal has another more abstract, high level method of dealing with bitwise data, sets. Sets allow the programmer to set, clear, intersect, and unite bitwise data values, rather than using direct bitwise operators (which are available in modern Pascal as well). Example;\n\nPascal: \n\nStatus := Status + [StickyFlag];\nStatus := Status - [StickyFlag];\nif (StickyFlag in Status) then ...\nor\n\nPascal: \n\nStatus := Status or StickyFlag;\nStatus := Status and not StickyFlag;\nif StickyFlag and Status = StickyFlag then ...\nC: \n\nStatus |= StickyFlag;\nStatus &= ~StickyFlag;\nif (Status & StickyFlag) { ...\nAlthough bit operations on integers and operations on sets can be considered similar if the sets are implemented using bits, there is no direct parallel between their uses unless a non-standard conversion between integers and sets is possible.\n\nDuring expression evaluation, and in \"both languages\", a boolean value may be internally stored as a single bit, a single byte, a full machine word, a position in the generated code, or as a condition code in a status register, depending on machine, compiler, and situation; these factors are usually more important than the language compiled.\n\nC has a less strict model of floating point types than Pascal. In C, integers may be implicitly converted to floating point numbers, and vice versa (though possible precision loss may be flagged by warnings). In Pascal, integers may be implicitly converted to codice_52, but conversion of codice_52 to codice_29 (where information may be lost) must be done explicitly via the functions codice_55 and codice_56, which truncate or round off the fraction, respectively.\n\nBoth C and Pascal include enumeration types. A Pascal example:\ntype\nvar\nA C example:\nenum color {red, green, blue};\nenum color a;\nThe behavior of the types in the two languages however is very different. In C, codice_57 becomes just a synonym for 0, codice_58 for 1, codice_59 for 2, and nothing prevents a value outside this range to be assigned to the variable codice_60. Furthermore, operations like codice_61 are strictly forbidden in Pascal; instead you would use codice_62. In C, enums can be freely converted to and from ints, but in Pascal, the function ord() must be used to convert from enumerated types to integers, in opposite conversion must be used typecast operation like codice_63 for codice_58 value return.\n\nBoth C and Pascal allow arrays of other complex types, including other arrays. However, there the similarity between the languages ends. C arrays are simply defined by a base type and the number of elements:\n\nint a[SIZE];\n\nand are always indexed from 0 up to SIZE-1 (i.e. modulo SIZE).\n\nIn Pascal, the range of indices is often specified by a subrange (as introduced under simple types above). The ten elements of\nvar a : array[0..9] of integer;\nwould be indexed by 0..9 (just as in C in this case). Array indices can be any ordinal data type, however, not just ranges:\n\ntype\n\nvar picture : array[1..640, 1..480] of RGB\n\nvar palette : array[byte, 0..2] of byte\n\nStrings consisting of n (>1) characters are defined as packed arrays with range 1..n.\n\nIn C expressions, an identifier representing an array is treated as a constant pointer to the first element of the array, thus, given the declarations codice_65 and codice_66 the assignment codice_67 is valid and causes p and a to point to the same array. As the identifier codice_60 represents a \"constant\" address, codice_69 is not valid however.\n\nWhile arrays in C are fixed, pointers to them are interchangeable. This flexibility allows C to manipulate any length array using the same code. It also leaves the programmer with the responsibility not to write outside the allocated array, as no checks are built in into the language.\n\nIn Pascal, arrays are a distinct type from pointers. This makes bounds checking for arrays possible from a compiler perspective. Practically all Pascal compilers support range checking as a compile \"option\". \nThe ability to both have arrays that change length at runtime, and be able to check them under language control, is often termed \"dynamic arrays\". In Pascal the number of elements in each array type is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed during the execution of the program. Hence, it is not possible to define an array whose length depends in any way on program data.\n\nC has the ability to initialize arrays of arbitrary length. The codice_70 operator can be used to obtain the size of a statically initialized array in C code. For instance in the following code, the terminating index for the loop automatically adjusts should the list of strings be changed.\nstatic char *wordlist[] = {\nstatic int listSize = (sizeof(wordlist)/sizeof(wordlist[0]));\nint i;\n\nfor (i=0; i<listSize; i++)\nfor (i=listSize-1; i>=0; i--)\nOriginal Pascal has neither array initialization (outside of the case of strings) nor a means of determining arbitrary array sizes at compile time.\n\nOne way of implementing the above example in Pascal, but without the automatic size adjustment, is:\nconst\n\ntype\nvar\n\nprocedure CreateList(var w: wordlist);\nbegin\nend;\n\nbegin\nend.\nIn both languages, a string is a primitive array of characters.\n\nIn Pascal a string literal of length n is compatible with the type codice_71. In C a string generally has the type codice_72.\n\nPascal has no support for variable-length arrays, and so any set of routines to perform string operations is dependent on a particular string size. The now standardized Pascal \"conformant array parameter\" extension solves this to a great extent, and many or even most implementations of Pascal have support for strings native to the language.\n\nC string literals are null-terminated; that is to say, a trailing null character as an end-of-string sentinel:\n\nconst char *p;\np = \"the rain in Spain\"; /* null-terminated */\n\nNull-termination must be manually maintained for string variables stored in arrays (this is often partly handled by library routines).\n\nC lacks built-in string or array assignment, so the string is not being transferred to p, but rather p is being made to point to the constant string in memory.\n\nIn Pascal, unlike C, the string's first character element is at index 1 and not 0 (leading it to be length-prefixed). This is because Pascal stores the length of the string at the 0th element of the character array. If this difference is not well understood it can lead to errors when porting or trying to interface object code generated by both languages.\n\nFreeBSD developer Poul-Henning Kamp, writing in \"ACM Queue\", would later refer to the victory of null-terminated strings over length-prefixed strings as \"the most expensive one-byte mistake\" ever.\n\nBoth C and Pascal can declare \"record\" types. In C, they are termed \"structures\".\n\nstruct a {\n\ntype a = record \nend;\nIn Pascal, we can use the sentence \"with <name_of_record> do\" in order to use directly the fields of that record, like local variables, instead of write <name_of_record>.<name_of_field>. Here there is an example:\n\ntype \nvar\nr1 : r;\nbegin\nwith r1 do begin\nend;\nThere is no equivalent feature to with in C.\n\nIn C, the exact bit length of a field can be specified:\n\nstruct a {\n\nHow much storage is used depends on traits (e.g., word-alignment) of the target system.\n\nThis feature is available in Pascal by using the subrange construct (3 bits gives a range from 0 to 7) in association with the keyword packed:\n\ntype a = packed record\nend;\n\nBoth C and Pascal support records which can include different fields overlapping each other:\n\nunion a {\n\ntype a = record\nend;\n\nBoth language processors are free to allocate only as much space for these records as needed to contain the largest type in the union/record.\n\nThe biggest difference between C and Pascal is that Pascal supports the explicit use of a \"tagfield\" for the language processor to determine if the valid component of the variant record is being accessed:\n\ntype a = record\nend;\n\nIn this case, the tagfield q must be set to the right state to access the proper parts of the record.\n\nIn C, pointers can be made to point at most program entities, including objects or functions:\nint a;\nint *b;\nint (*compare)(int c, int d);\nint MyCompare(int c, int d);\nb = &a;\ncompare = &MyCompare;\nIn C, since arrays and pointers have a close equivalence, the following are the same:\na = b[5];\na = *(b+5);\na = *(5+b);\na = 5[b];\nThus, pointers are often used in C as just another method to access arrays.\n\nTo create dynamic data, the library functions codice_73 and codice_74 are used to obtain and release dynamic blocks of data. Thus, dynamic memory allocation is not built into the language processor. This is especially valuable when C is being used in operating system kernels or embedded targets as these things are very platform (not just architecture) specific and would require changing the C compiler for each platform (or operating system) that it would be used on.\n\nPascal doesn't have the same kind of pointers as C, but it does have an indirection operator that covers the most common use of C pointers. Each pointer is bound to a single dynamic data item, and can only be moved by assignment:\ntype a = ^integer;\nvar b, c: a;\nnew(b);\nc := b;\nPointers in Pascal are type safe; i.e. a pointer to one data type can only be assigned to a pointer of the same data type. Also pointers can never be assigned to non-pointer variables. Pointer arithmetic (a common source of programming errors in C, especially when combined with endianness issues and platform-independent type sizes) is not permitted in Pascal.\nAll of these restrictions reduce the possibility of pointer-related errors in Pascal compared to C, but do not prevent invalid pointer references in Pascal altogether. For example, a runtime error will occur if a pointer is referenced before it has been initialized or after it has been disposed.\n\nThe languages differ significantly when it comes to expression evaluation, but all-in-all they are comparable.\n\n\"Pascal\"\n\n\"C\"\n\nMost operators serve several purposes in Pascal, for instance, the minus sign may be used for negation, subtraction, or set difference (depending on both type and syntactical context), the codice_94 operator may be used to compare numbers, strings, or sets, and so on. C uses dedicated operator symbols to a greater extent.\n\nThe two languages use different operators for assignment. Pascal, like ALGOL, uses the mathematical equality operator codice_95 for the equality test and the symbol codice_96 for assignment, whereas C, like B, uses the mathematical equality operator for assignment. In C (and B) the new codice_97 symbol was therefore introduced for the equality test.\n\nIt is a common mistake in C, due either to inexperience or to a simple typing error, to accidentally put assignment expressions in conditional statements such as codice_98. The code in braces will always execute because the assignment expression codice_99 has the value 10 which is non-zero and therefore considered \"true\" in C; this is in part because C (and ALGOL) allow multiple assignment in the form codice_100 which is not supported by Pascal. Also note that codice_60 now has the value codice_102, which may affect the following code. Recent C compilers try to detect these cases and warn the user, asking for a less ambiguous syntax like codice_103.\n\nThis kind of mistake cannot happen in Pascal, as assignments are not expressions and do not have a value: using the wrong operator will cause an unambiguous compilation error, and it's also less likely that anyone would mistake the codice_96 symbol for an equality test.\n\nIt is notable that ALGOL's conditional expression in the form codice_105 has an equivalent in C but not in Pascal.\n\nWhen Niklaus Wirth designed Pascal, the desire was to limit the number of levels of precedence (fewer parse routines, after all). So the OR and exclusive OR operators are treated just like an Addop and processed at the level of a math expression. Similarly, the AND is treated like a Mulop and processed with Term. The precedence levels are\nNotice that there is only ONE set of syntax rules, applying to both kinds of operators. According to this grammar, then, expressions like\n\nare perfectly legal. And, in fact, they are, as far as the parser is concerned. Pascal doesn't allow the mixing of arithmetic and Boolean variables, and things like this are caught at the semantic level, when it comes time to generate code for them, rather than at the syntax level.\n\nThe authors of C took a diametrically opposite approach: they treat the operators as different, and in fact, in C there are no fewer than 15 levels. That's because C also has the operators '=', '+=' and its kin, '«', '»', '++', '--', etc. Although in C the arithmetic and Boolean operators are treated separately, the variables are not: a Boolean test can be made on any integer value.\n\nIn Pascal a \"boolean\" expression that relies on a particular evaluation ordering (possibly via side-effects in function calls) is, more or less, regarded as an error. The Pascal compiler has the freedom to use whatever ordering it may prefer and must always evaluate the whole expression even if the result can be determined by partial evaluation.\n\nIn C, dependence on \"boolean\" evaluation order is perfectly legal, and often systematically employed using the codice_8 and codice_9 operators together with operators such as codice_108, codice_109, the comma operator, etc. The codice_8 and codice_9 operators thereby function as combinations of logical operators and conditional \"statements\".\n\nShort circuit expression evaluation has been commonly considered an advantage for C because of the \"evaluation problem\":\n\nvar i: integer;\n\nThis seemingly straightforward search is problematic in Pascal because the array access a[i] would be invalid for i equal to 11.\n\nHowever, in superscalar processors there is a penalty for all jumps because they cause pipeline stalls, and programs created for them are more efficient if jumps are removed where possible. Pascal's ability to evaluate using a fixed formula without jumps can be an advantage with highly optimizing compilers, whereas C has effectively prevented this by requiring short circuit optimization.\n\nStatements for building control structures are roughly analogous and relatively similar (at least the first three).\n\nPascal has:\nC has:\n\nPascal, in its original form, did not have an equivalent to default, but an equivalent else clause is a common extension. Pascal programmers otherwise had to guard case-statements with an expression such as: .\n\nC has the so-called early-out statements break and continue, and some Pascals have them as well.\n\nBoth C and Pascal have a goto statement. However, since Pascal has nested procedures/functions, jumps can be done from an inner procedure or function to the containing one; this was commonly used to implement error recovery. C has this ability via the ANSI C setjmp and longjmp. This is equivalent, but arguably less safe, since it stores program specific information like jump addresses and stack frames in a programmer accessible structure.\n\nPascal routines that return a value are called functions; routines that don't return a value are called procedures. All routines in C are called functions; C functions that do not return a value are declared with a return type of \"void\".\n\nPascal procedures are considered equivalent to C \"void\" functions, and Pascal functions are equivalent to C functions that return a value.\n\nThe following two declarations in C:\n\nint f(int x, int y);\nvoid k(int q);\nare equivalent to the following declarations in Pascal:\n\nfunction f(x, y: integer): integer;\nprocedure k(q: integer);\nPascal has two different types of parameters: pass-by-value, and pass-by-reference (VAR).\n\nfunction f(var k: integer): integer;\nx := f(t);\nIn C all parameters are passed by value but pass-by-reference can be simulated using pointers. The following segment is similar to the Pascal segment above:\nint f(int *k); //function accepts a pointer as parameter\nx = f(&t);\nC allows for functions to accept a variable number of parameters, known as variadic functions.\nint f(int a, ...);\nf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nThe function codice_112 uses a special set of functions that allow it to access each of the parameters in turn.\n\nAdditionally Pascal has I/O statements built into the language to handle variable amount of parameters, like codice_113. Pascal allows procedures and functions to be nested. This is convenient to allow variables that are local to a group of procedures, but not global. C lacks this feature and the localization of variables or functions can be done only for a compiling module wherein the variables or functions would have been declared static.\n\nC allows functions to be indirectly invoked through a function pointer. In the following example, the statement codice_114 is equivalent to codice_115:\n\nint (*cmpar)(const char *a, const char *b);\nconst char *s1 = \"hello\";\nconst char *s2 = \"world\";\n\ncmpar = &strcmp;\nb = (*cmpar)(s1, s2);\nPascal also allows functions and procedures to be passed as parameters to functions or procedures:\nprocedure ShowHex(i: integer);\nend;\n\nprocedure ShowInt(i: integer);\nend;\n\nprocedure Demo(procedure Show(i: integer));\nvar j: integer;\nbegin\nend;\nEarly C had neither constant declarations nor type declarations, and the C language was originally defined as needing a \"preprocessor\"; a separate program, and pass, that handled constant, include and macro definitions, to keep memory usage down. Later, with ANSI C, it obtained constant and type definitions features and the preprocessor also became part of the language, leading to the syntax we see today.\n\nPascal constant and type defines are built in, but there were programmers using a preprocessor also with Pascal (sometimes the same one used with C), certainly not as common as with C. Although often pointed out as a \"lack\" in Pascal, technically C doesn't have program modularity nor macros built in either. It has a simple low level separate compilation facility, however (traditionally using the same generic linker used for assembly language), Pascal does not.\n\nIn C, the programmer may inspect the byte-level representation of any object by pointing a codice_39 pointer to it:\n\nint a;\nchar *p = (char *)(&a);\nchar c = *p; // first byte of a\nIt may be possible to do something similar in Pascal using an undiscriminated variant record:\n\nvar a: integer;\nbegin\nend;\n\nAlthough casting is possible on most Pascal compilers and interpreters, even in the code above a2c.a and a2c.b aren't required by any Pascal standardizations to share the same address space. Niklaus Wirth, the designer of Pascal, has written about the problematic nature of attempting type escapes using this approach:\n\n\"Most implementors of Pascal decided that this checking would be too expensive, enlarging code and deteriorating program efficiency. As a consequence, the variant record became a favourite feature to breach the type system by all programmers in love with tricks, which usually turn into pitfalls and calamities\".\n\nSeveral languages now specifically exclude such type escapes, for example Java, C# and Wirth's own Oberon.\n\nIn C files do not exist as a built-in type (they are defined in a system header) and all I/O takes place via library calls. Pascal has file handling built into the language.\n\nThe typical statements used to perform I/O in each language are:\nprintf(\"The sum is: %d\\n\", x);\nwriteln('The sum is: ', x);\nThe main difference is that C uses a \"format string\" that is interpreted to find the arguments to the printf function and convert them, whereas Pascal performs that under the control of the language processor. The Pascal method is arguably faster, because no interpretation takes place, but the C method is highly extensible.\n\nSome popular Pascal implementations have incorporated virtually all C constructs into Pascal. Examples include type casts, being able to obtain the address of any variable, local or global, and different types of integers with special promotion properties.\n\nHowever, the incorporation of C's lenient attitude towards types and type conversions can result in a Pascal that loses some or all of its type security. For example, Java and C# were created in part to address some of the perceived type security issues of C, and have \"managed\" pointers that cannot be used to create invalid references. In its original form (as described by Niklaus Wirth), Pascal qualifies as a managed pointer language, some 30 years before either Java or C#. However, a Pascal amalgamated with C would lose that protection by definition. In general, the lower dependence on pointers for basic tasks makes it safer than C in practice.\n\nThe Extended Pascal standard extends Pascal to support many things C supports, which the original standard Pascal did not, in a type safer manner. For example, schema types support (besides other uses) variable-length arrays while keeping the type-safety of mandatory carrying the array dimension with the array, allowing automatic run-time checks for out-of-range indices also for dynamically sized arrays.\n\n\n"}

Strict zoning laws prohibit any planned communities from developing, with large single-family housing lots and agricultural activity predominating.\n\nBecause of its higher elevation and microclimate, the weather of The Hereford Zone is slightly different from that of the rest of the county. It is not unusual in the winter for schools in the surrounding areas to be 2 hours late, while the Hereford Zone is closed due to inclement weather.\n\nNear the most northern part of the zone in the topmost strip where Baltimore County meets south central Pennsylvania, numerous mini tornadoes and wind storms zip through the fields unfettered by buildings or natural land changes to halt their progress. The air quality in the area is markedly different from that of the suburbs of Baltimore City to the south. Both the land elevation as it climbs from sea level to 966' at the Mason-Dixon Line near Stiltz, Pa.,on Middletown Rd and the absence of smokestack manufacturing combine with the prevailing westerly winds to eliminate the yellow haze associated with low levels of pollution on even the most humid summer days.\n\nHereford High School, Parkton has the only agriscience program in the county along with Hereford Middle School.

Lewis.\n\nAravis is a young Tarkheena, a female member of the ruling nobility of Calormen. With her horse, Hwin, who is revealed to be a talking beast from the land of Narnia, she flees from her home, in order to escape an arranged marriage with Ahoshta Tarkaan. Aravis is a strong character, whose confidence, bravery and loyalty are offset by arrogance and self-centeredness. She is also said to be an amazing storyteller, which is partly the result of her upbringing: the art of telling stories forms part of the education of the nobility. On their journey north to freedom in Narnia, they fall into company with the talking stallion, Bree, and the boy Shasta. Aravis overhears a plot by the Calormenes to invade Archenland and Narnia, and with this intelligence the four companions are able to warn the Archenlanders in time to thwart the invasion. In the process of their adventures, through a series of \"lessons\" and encounters, Aravis's character is transformed, and she acquires humility and sensitivity. Her companion, Shasta, is discovered to be the lost heir to the kingdom of Archenland, and, upon reaching adulthood, he and Aravis marry, and rule as king and queen. They are the parents of Ram the Great, the \"most famous of all the kings of Archenland\".\n\nAravis says of her family, \"...I am the only daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, the son of Rishti Tarkaan, the son of Kidrash Tarkaan, the son of Illsombreh Tisroc, the son of Ardeeb Tisroc who was descended in a right line from the god Tash.\" (from \"The Horse and his Boy\")\n\nAravis has spent her youth in the heart of Calormen, presumably in Calavar, the province over which her father is lord. Her mother died of unknown causes and her older brother, to whom she was devoted, was killed fighting rebels in \"the western wars\". Her father has recently married an unkind woman, who makes no attempt to disguise her dislike for her stepdaughter. Aravis also has a younger brother who is \"but a child\". Her already difficult home life is rendered impossible when her father announces her engagement to Ahoshta Tarkaan, a wealthy and powerful but loathsome courtier whom she despises. In response she decides to commit suicide. However, her mare, Hwin, reveals herself as a Talking Horse from Narnia and persuades her to flee to Narnia instead.\n\nAs the two ride through Calormen, they meet Bree and Shasta, the eponymous horse and boy, who are also escaping to Narnia. The four try to traverse Calormen's capital of Tashbaan undetected, but they are separated. Aravis meets her friend Lasaraleen, who is also a Tarkheena. Aravis and Lasaraleen explore the Tisroc's palace, and accidentally overhear a plan by the Tisroc and his son Crown Prince Rabadash to invade Archenland. When Aravis meets Shasta and the horses again at the tombs of the ancient rulers of Calormen, they agree they must urgently warn Narnia and Archenland.\n\nAs they near the border of Archenland, they are chased by a lion who slashes Aravis' back. Her wounds force her to remain with the Hermit of the Southern March while Shasta goes alone to complete the mission. She watches the battle through the Hermit's magic pool, appalled at the danger that Shasta faces. While in the Hermit's home, Aravis encounters Aslan, an event that changes her as Aravis also learned that Aslan was the lion who slashed her in the back in retribution for the punishment administered to her slave-maid (whom Aravis dosed with a sleeping draught in order to escape).\n\nShasta is recognized as Cor, the eldest son of King Lune of Archenland, and Aravis comes to live at the castle of Anvard with the royal family. Many years later, Cor and Aravis marry, and she becomes queen of Archenland and mother of Ram the Great.\n\nShe is last seen in \"The Last Battle\", present at the Great Reunion in Aslan's Country along with her husband, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and son.\n\nSeveral writers, including Philip Pullman, Kyrie O'Connor, and Gregg Easterbrook, consider the use of Calormene characters as villains to be evidence of racism. Aravis is often presented as a counterexample to this (along with Emeth, who is accepted in Aslan's country for good deeds worthy of Aslan), since she is sympathetically portrayed as a largely virtuous Calormene heroine.\n\n"}

{"id": "1986906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986906", "title": "Ormia ochracea", "text": "Ormia ochracea\n\nOrmia ochracea is a small yellow nocturnal fly in the family Tachinidae. It is notable for its parasitism of crickets and its exceptionally acute directional hearing. The female is attracted to the song of the male cricket and deposits larvae on or around him, as was discovered in 1975 by the zoologist William H. Cade.\n\n\"Ormia ochracea\" is a model organism in sound localization experiments because of its unique \"ears\", which are complex structures inside the fly's prothorax near the bases of its front legs. The fly is too small for the time difference of sound arriving at the two ears to be calculated in the usual way, yet it can determine the direction of sound sources with exquisite precision. The tympanic membranes of opposite ears are directly connected mechanically, allowing resolution of nanosecond time differences and requiring a new neural coding strategy. Various research groups have designed low-noise differential microphones inspired by \"O. ochracea\"’s directionally sensitive hearing system.\n\n\"Ormia ochracea\" is native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Texas and Florida. \"O. ochracea\" is also found throughout North America, South America, and the Caribbean, though its exact range is not known.\n\n\"Ormia ochracea\" has the full life cycle of egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. Once a female fly finds a suitable host, she deposits planidia (first instar larvae) which then quickly burrow into the host. The planidia develop within the body of the field cricket host, embedding initially in muscle before migrating into the abdomen. The larvae molt within the host’s abdomen and feed primarily on the host’s muscle and fat. \"O. ochracea\" larvae typically complete development and emerge after about 7 days, which subsequently kills the host. The larvae pupate and emerge as adult flies approximately 2 weeks after emerging from the host. \n\"O. ochracea\" is a parasitoid known to prey on several species of \"Gryllus\" field crickets including \"Gryllus integer, Gryllus rubens, Gryllus texensis,\" and \"Gryllus firmus.\" Flies have been observed responding to various cricket songs, but seem to be limited to the family Gryllidae. The natural host of the fly may vary by location. Larvae of \"O. ochracea\" exhibit highest survival in its natural host and limited survival in other potential host species.\n\nIn 1975, William H. Cade experimentally demonstrated that \"Ormia ochracea\" uses the mating call of the field cricket as a means to locate its host. Cade placed dead crickets on top of speakers playing cricket songs and various control sounds and recorded the amount of time the fly spent on either the control or test speaker. He found that flies spent more time on the speakers playing cricket songs and observed that the flies would always deposit larvae on and around the speaker which was playing cricket songs.\n\n\"O. ochracea\" have been shown to adjust their preference for host songs after exposure to different songs in the laboratory. In a 2011 study, flies that were previously exposed to the \"G. lineaticeps\" song chose the \"G. lineaticeps\" song over the \"G. integer\" song, and vice versa. This preference was very short term. \"O. ochracea\"'s flexible learning capabilities may have been critical in expanding its host and geographical range.\n\n\"O. ochracea\" infestation has been shown to affect the behavior and reproduction of host field crickets. Early in the infestation period, non-reproductive behavior is largely unimpaired because the parasitic larvae do not consume the digestive system or central nervous system of the host. After the larvae migrate to the host’s abdomen, the host’s mating, egg-laying, and fighting ability decline, most likely due to tissue damage caused by the larvae. Additionally, infestation of female crickets alters their mating preferences. \"Gryllus lineaticeps\" females normally prefer to respond to male songs with intermediate chirp rates over those with slow chirp rates, but females parasitized by \"O. ochracea\" show no preference between chrip rates. Reduced selectivity in infested female \"G. lineaticeps\" may be adaptive, as a female may be more likely to reproduce before being killed by the parasitoids if they are less selective.\n\nSome species of cricket which are parasitzed by \"O. ochracea\" have evolved methods to avoid infestation. For example, some members of the prey cricket \"Teleogryllus oceanicus\" have a mutation called flat wing, in which the sound-producing structures of the male forewings are erased. The flat wing was first observed in 2003 on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and was also found on neighbouring Oahu two years later. Genetic studies of crickets from each island show that the mutations arose from different genomic variations.\n\nBecause field crickets commonly sing at night, \"O. ochracea\" are susceptible to predation by bats. Studies have shown that \"O. ochracea\" has evolved an acoustic startle response to bat-like ultrasound, a response very similar to that of female crickets. \"O. ochracea\" has also been shown to demonstrate a sharp response boundary between the frequencies of cricket song and bat ultrasound.\n\nIn order for an animal to localize sound, it must be able to detect minute differences in intensity and time between the arrival of the sound to the ear closer to the source and the ear further from the source. \"O. ochracea\" displays a remarkable ability to localize sound despite the incredibly small distance (450-520μm) between its acoustic sensory organs. Its sound localization ability is facilitated by a cuticular structure which joins its ears, mechanically coupling their motion and magnifying interaural differences by a factor of about 20. Prior to \"O. ochracea\" no similar mechanism of auditory localization had been described.\n\nSeveral researchers have reported the construction of microphones inspired by the hearing system of \"O. ochracea.\" In 2009, R.N. Miles et. all designed and created a low-noise differential microphone inspired by the unique hearing system of \"O. ochracea\", for use in hearing aids\".\" The design of their microphone diaphragm, which measures 1 x 2 mm, is based on the mechanically coupled ears of \"O. ochracea.\" Their microphone was found to have lower noise than commercially available hearing aid microphones while minimizing distance between sensors. In April 2015, a group from the University of Strathclyde and the MRC/CSO Institute for Hearing Research (IHR) announced that it had created a microphone based on \"O. ochracea\"'s hearing system, and had been awarded a £430,000 grant by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to build and test the hearing aid for three years.\n\n"}

The album reached No. 48 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, the band's highest chart position, and remained on that chart for thirteen weeks.\n\n\"The Headless Children\" showcases a new level of maturity from the band compared to their previous three albums, which had stereotypically lewd \"rock and roll\" lyrics. Politics and social issues are now a theme throughout the album. The cover art, based on \"Gateway to Stalingrad\", a cartoon by Daniel R. Fitzpatrick, depicts a string of historical figures including Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Benito Mussolini, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Al Capone and the Ku Klux Klan, with an image of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald shown prominently in the foreground. Later editions of the album have replaced, among others, Ayatollah Khomeini with additional KKK members.\n\n\"The Headless Children\" was the first W.A.S.P. album to feature ex-Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali and the last studio album to feature guitarist Chris Holmes for nearly a decade until he rejoined the band in late 1997 to record \"Kill.Fuck.Die\".\n\n\"The Real Me\" is one of two songs the band covered and released as part of the \"Headless Children\" release, (the other being \"Locomotive Breath\", by Jethro Tull, which was the b-side of the single \"Mean Man\"). \"The Real Me\" however was the only song of the two to make the album. The song was written by Pete Townshend of The Who's and is from their classic rock opera album, \"Quadrophenia\".\n\n\"Mean Man\", written by lead singer/bassist Blackie Lawless, is about guitarist Chris Holmes' wild lifestyle and is dedicated to him; ironically Holmes left the band shortly after the album's release, though he did return 10 years later. \n\nLawless stated in an interview shortly after the release of the album, that \"The Neutron Bomber\", is about Ronald Reagan and the power he and America had over the world, with such a large nuclear arsenal.

He also noted \"The Real Me\", \"Mean Man\", \"The Heretic\", \"Forever Free\" and the title track as highlights. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described the album as \"the W.A.S.P. record for those who don't like W.A.S.P., hollow, damp and alone, integrity discovered, humanity revealed.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He was 8th of 12 children, born to Walter Atlas and Pearl Motley Frye. He went to the Ellerbe Colored High School, but by accident he obtained a diploma from Ellerbe High School, the white one. After graduating with honors from North Carolina A&T State University, Frye reached the rank of captain in the United States Air Force, serving in Korea and Japan. Upon returning to North Carolina, Frye was inspired to become a lawyer when he was denied the ability to register to vote by so-called \"literacy\" tests. He graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Law.\n\nFrye became an assistant U.S. Attorney in 1963, one of the first African-Americans to hold such a position in the South. When Frye was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly as a state representative in 1968, he was the only black North Carolina legislator, and the first elected in the 20th century. Frye helped eliminate the vestiges of Jim Crow from North Carolina law. He was re-elected several times to the state House, serving until 1980, and served one term in the state Senate from 1981 to 1982. During this time, he was also an instructor at North Carolina Central University's law school.\n\nIn 1983, Governor Jim Hunt appointed Frye to the North Carolina Supreme Court as an associate justice, the first African-American to hold that position in North Carolina history. Elected in 1984 to the court and re-elected in 1992, Jim Hunt appointed Frye to the state's highest judicial post, chief justice, in 1999 to replace the retiring Burley Mitchell. He was defeated for election to a full term in 2000 by Associate Justice I. Beverly Lake.\n\nFrye currently practices law with Brooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nIn 2007, Frye received the North Carolina Award for public service. In 2009, he became honorary co-chairman of the U.S. Senate campaign of Kenneth Lewis. He was named chairman of the North Carolina Institute of Political Leadership in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, the General Alumni Association had awarded Frye with the Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nIn 2015 a portrait of him was dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2017 he was invited to participate at the University of North Carolina School of Law's Constitution Day celebration.\n\nIn 2018 a bridge was named in his honor.\n\nOne of Frye's children, Henry Frye Jr., also became a lawyer and judge.\nFrye is the uncle of professional basketball player Channing Frye.\n\n"}

He returned in issue #8 (Jan 1942). In \"All Winners Comics\" #6 (Sept 1942), he changed his hero name to the Black Avenger. This was his last Golden Age appearance.\n\nFrustrated that the United States did not seem to be dealing with crime or Nazi saboteurs, radio operator Jerry Carstairs created a costume with a built-in microphone and fought for justice as the Thunderer. In his first recorded appearance, Jerry learned that radio station WWLX was really a front for Nazi Fifth Columnists who were transmitting secret messages hidden in music. Learning that they were targeting his girlfriend Eileen Conroy, a newspaper reporter, foiled their operation. In order to protect his secret identity, Jerry acted like a meek weakling while in his civilian guise. Thunderer later uncovered the machinations of a hideously deformed dwarf named Gore who hated beautiful people so much that he rigged Morse code death traps that killed his victims over the radio. The Thunderer destroyed his operation, and Gore was killed in a house fire caused by faulty wiring in his equipment.\n\nThunderer's activities were far and few between due to the limitations his position with the FCC provided in giving him leads to criminal or spy activities. The Thunderer briefly changed his name (but not his costume) to the Black Avenger. In the fall of 1942, the FBI caught a Nazi spy that resembled Jerry and convinced him to go undercover to try and expose the spy ring that was sending defense secrets back to Nazi Germany. As the Black Avenger, Jerry managed to round up the Nazis including their leader Kurt Weidner and turn him over to justice\n\nAlongside a number of other heroes, the Thunderer participated in an air drop on a Nazi stronghold.\n\nThe Thunderer attended a reunion of World War II costumed heroes.\n\nIn 1943, the Black Avenger was among a number of heroes who were slain by the Cosmic Cube-wielding Red Skull and impaled on a massive wall. However, the Cosmic Cube was recovered by Private Paul Anslen who resurrected all the slain heroes who aided the combined efforts of the Invaders and the time displaced New Avengers and Mighty Avengers. When Red Skull was defeated, the heroes used the Cosmic Cube to wipe out the Black Avenger's memories of the event to preserve history.\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, Thunderer is seen as a resident of Valhalla Villas (a retirement home for ex-heroes and ex-villains in Miami). He was temporarily de-aged during the Incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.\n\nIn Marvel Comics #1000, it was reveal that Jerry was a subject in a side project of Project Rebirth, the government project that create Captain America, called Project Thunderer. Thunderer's mask is a magical item called the Eternity Mask, which was created by a group of renegade occultist from Eternity's own substance in the days of King Arthur. When his friend Spirit of '76 as Captain America as killed by Adam II, Thunderer blamed the Scientist Guild, also known as the Three Xs and later Enclave, for their role in Nasland's death as they was responsible for bankrolling Professor Horton to create another android like the Humans Torch as well supply Adam-II's programming with the Three Xs's ideas for the next stage of mankind and leading to the android's madness. Changing his identity to Black Avenger, Carstairs swears to take down the Three Xs. However, Thunderer was killed and the Eternity Mask taken by Enclave. His corpse would be found by Marvel Boy, with a recording to stop the Scientists Guild.\n\nThunderer is a good hand-to-hand combatant.\n\nDue to the construction of his costume, Thunderer is capable of deafening people or leveling buildings with his sonic scream.\n\n\n"}

The GP7 was offered both with and without control cabs, and those built without control cabs were called a GP7B. Five GP7B's were built between March and April 1953. The GP7 was the first EMD road locomotive to use a hood unit design instead of a car-body design. This proved to be more efficient than the car body design as the hood unit cost less to build, was cheaper and easier to maintain, and had much better front and rear visibility for switching.\n\nOf the 2,734 GP7's built, 2,620 were for American railroads (including 5 GP7B units built for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway), 112 were built for Canadian railroads, and 2 were built for Mexican railroads.\n\nThis was the first model in EMD's GP \"(General Purpose\") series of locomotives. Concurrently, EMD offered a six-axle (C-C) SD \"(Special Duty)\" locomotive, the SD7. The GP7 was replaced by the GP9 model in GM-EMD's GP sequence.\n\nALCO, Fairbanks-Morse, and Baldwin had all introduced road switchers before EMD, whose first attempt at the road-switcher, the BL2 was unsuccessful in the market, selling only 58 units in the 14 months it was in production. Its replacement, the GP7, swapped the truss-framed stressed car body for an un-stressed body on a frame made from flat, formed and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a \"weldment\"), a basic design which is still being employed today. Unfortunately, in heavy service, the GP7’s frame would bow and sag over time. This defect was corrected in later models. The GP7 proved very popular, and EMD was barely able to meet demand, even after opening a second assembly plant at Cleveland, Ohio. Later, locomotives in EMD's GP-series came to be nicknamed ‘Geeps’. Many GP7s both high and short-hood can still be found in service today on shortline railroads and industrial operators, although most Class 1 roads stopped using these locomotives by the 1980s some remain in rebuilt form on some major Class I railroads, as switcher locomotives.. The \"GP\" designation stood for \"general purpose\", while the \"7\" had no meaning other than matching the EMD F7 cab unit then in production.\n\nThe GP7, GP9 and GP18 locomotives share a similar car-body that evolved over time. Most GP7s had three sets of ventilation grills under the cab (where the GP9 only had one), and two pair of grills at the end of the long hood (where only the pair nearest the end was retained on the GP9). However, some late GP7s were built with car-bodies that were identical to early GP9s. Early GP7s had a solid skirt above the fuel tank, while late GP7s and early GP9s had access holes in the skirt (see photo of Illinois Terminal 1605, top left). Many railroads later removed most of the skirt to improve access and inspection.\n\nLocomotives could be built with the engineer’s control stand installed for either the long hood, or the short hood designated as the front. Two control stands for either direction running was also an option, but one end would still be designated as the front for maintenance purposes. The GP7 was also available with or without dynamic brakes, and a steam generator installed in the short hood was also an option. In the latter case, the fuel tank was divided, with half for diesel fuel, and half for boiler water. One option available for locomotives without dynamic brakes, was to remove the two air reservoir tanks from under the frame, and replace them with four tanks that were installed on the roof of the locomotive, above the prime mover. These \"torpedo tubes\" as they were nicknamed, enabled the fuel and water tanks to be increased to each, although some railroads opted for roof-mounted air tanks and fuel tanks on their freight ‘Geeps’.\n\nThere are five GP7s on A J Kristopan's EMD Serial number page that reused previous serial numbers: B&O 6405, CRI&P 1308 (2nd), L&N 501 (2nd) and 502 (2nd), and SLSF 615 (2nd). These rebuilt units were rebuilt as new on new frames. Another rebuild by GMD is that CN 4824 was rebuilt as a GP7 with parts from an F3A in October 1958.\n\nOver 100 GP7s and four of the GP7Bs were built with 567BC or 567C engines starting in March 1953 through May 1954. These are noted on the roster above.\n\nMany railroads rebuilt their GP7s with low short hoods; some railroads went further in their rebuilding than others.

It is 12 miles east of Altoona, the nearest city. Canoe Lake, at , is the focus of recreation at the park and is open for fishing year-round. Canoe Creek State Park is a half mile off U.S. Route 22 near the small town of Canoe Creek. The park was opened to the public in 1979 and was developed as part of an expansion effort in the 1970s to improve the state park system in Pennsylvania.\n\nCanoe Creek State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \"Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\".\n\nThe area in and surrounding Canoe Creek State Park is rich in limestone. The limestone was quarried and used for many purposes like providing needed raw materials for the iron and steel industries of Pennsylvania. There are several abandoned quarries on the park lands. Two limekilns also operated within the boundaries of the park during the 1900s. The remnants of a kiln once owned by the Blair Limestone Company stand today as a reminder of the industrial past. The Blair Limestone Company kiln is a stop on the Path of Progress tour, a driving tour of Pennsylvania's industrial heritage stretching for .\n\nThe Frank Felbaum Bat Sanctuary is the home of the largest nursery colony of little brown bats in Pennsylvania. This one-time church, now known as the Canoe Creek Bat Refuge, attracts visitors interested in observing the bats as they emerge each night for feeding. The park is also the site of a hibernaculum for more than 30,000 bats of six species, including the endangered Indiana bat.\n\nCanoe Creek State park is on the path followed by many species of migratory birds including waterfowl, bald eagles and ospreys. The wetlands provide habitat for birds like the bluebird, oriole, red-winged blackbird and the brown thrasher.\n\nThe park also provided a habitat for the woodland creatures most common in Pennsylvania, white-tailed deer, turkey, squirrels, chipmunks, and ruffed grouse. The hunting of these animals is permitted during the hunting seasons designated by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.\n\nCanoe Lake is stocked with game fish by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Fisherman can catch bass, trout, walleye, muskellunge, pickerel and catfish during the summer and winter months at Canoe Lake. Ice fishing is permitted, but the thickness of the ice is not monitored.\n\nThe sand beach at Canoe Lake is opened starting Memorial Day weekend and ending Labor Day weekend. Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.\n\nThe only motorized boats permitted on Canoe Lake are electrically powered. They must be properly registered with any state. Non-powered boats such as rowboats, canoes and kayaks must also display registration stickers from any state.\n\nThere are eight miles of trails that are open year-round to hiking, cross-country skiing, horseback riding, mountain biking and snowmobiles. These trails follow the shores of Canoe Lake and pass through woodlands, wetlands, meadows and the historic limestone kilns. Hikers are asked to wear fluorescent orange, for safety matters, when hiking during hunting season.\n\nCanoe Creek State Park has a large picnic area near the lake. Charcoal grills are available for use. There are three pavilions for rent. Eight modern cabins are available to rent year-round. Each cabin sleeps six people and has electric heat, two bedrooms, living room, dining room, bathroom, and kitchen. Outside of the cabins are a fire ring and picnic table.\n\nThe Terry Wentz Education Center is open year-round, near the modern cabins, and provides brochures on the education program and the wildlife of the park.\n\nThe following state parks are within of Canoe Creek State Park:\n\n"}

Beverly Lake Sr.\n\nIsaac Beverly \"Bev\" Lake Sr. (1906–1996), was an American jurist, law professor at Wake Forest University and Campbell University, and politician. He was born in Wake Forest, North Carolina.\n\nA graduate of Wake Forest College and Harvard Law School, Lake joined the staff of North Carolina Attorney General Harry McMullan in 1950. There, he drew upon his knowledge of public utility law to handle rate cases before the state Utilities Commission, which earned him a reputation as a consumer advocate. When the United States Supreme Court invited North Carolina to appear as amicus curiae in the famous \"Brown v. Board of Education\" case in 1954, Lake argued against it, telling the governor that it was a \"diabolical scheme\" designed to subject the state directly to whatever orders the Court issued as a consequence of the decision. The governor nevertheless decided to file an amicus brief, and Lake presented the state's case in defense of segregation before the Supreme Court during hearings over \"Brown II\".\n\nAfter the Supreme Court handed down its decision insisting on the dismantling of the state's segregated school system, Lake attacked the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in a speech in Asheboro, accusing it of agitating the state's African-American population. Lake's speech established him as a leader of the state's segregationists, some of whom suggested that he should run for governor. Now in private practice, Lake remained coy but continued to assist segregationist efforts, attacking the sitting governor, Luther Hodges for caving in to national pressure to adopt a moderate course and preparing a bill for the North Carolina General Assembly that would have amended the state's constitution to remove the requirement for a system of publicly funded schools.\n\nYet as the 1960 gubernatorial election approached, Lake initially announced that he would not be a candidate for governor due to a lack of funds. The entry of the state's moderate attorney-general, Malcolm Seawell into the race, along with the start of the lunch-counter demonstrations in Greensboro caused Lake to change his mind, and he announced his candidacy for the office. In one advertisement, he wrote \"The mixing of our two great races in the classroom and then in the home is not inevitable and is not to be tolerated.\". Lake made segregation the dominant issue of his campaign, attacking Hodges's management of integration and the NAACP. With Robert Burren Morgan acting as his Campaign Manager, Lake did well enough to place second in the Democratic primary to Terry Sanford, but in the subsequent runoff election, Sanford defeated Lake by a margin of 50,000 votes.\n\nIn 1964 Lake ran for governor again, but he did not survive the first primary. After conceding the race, he threw his support to Judge Dan Moore, which was crucial to Moore's victory in the runoff. In return for his support, Moore named Lake to the next opening on the North Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nLake was sworn-in as an associate justice on August 30, 1965. He served until 1978.\n\nHe was the father of I. Beverly Lake Jr., who followed him into politics and law.\n\n"}
{"id": "1986982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986982", "title": "Fort Negley", "text": "Fort Negley\n\nFort Negley was a fortification built by Union troops after the capture of Nashville, Tennessee during the American Civil War, located approximately south of the city center. It was the largest inland fort built in the United States during the war. \n\nOnce Confederate forces were routed in February, 1862, from Forts Henry and Donelson (on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively), Confederate commanders decided that any further effort in the defense of Nashville would be pointless, and they abandoned any attempt to keep Nashville behind their lines. It was almost immediately occupied by Union forces, who rapidly began preparations for its defense. The largest of the fortifications erected was Fort Negley, a star-shaped limestone block structure atop St. Cloud Hill, south of the city. The construction of the fort was overseen by Captain James St. Clair Morton. The fort was constructed out of of stone, of earth and cost $130,000. It was largely constructed using the labor of local slaves (including women), newly freed slaves who had flocked to Nashville once it was taken by Union forces with the understanding that their status as slaves was to be revoked were they to work for the Union, and by free blacks forcibly conscripted for the work. Records show that 2,768 blacks were officially enrolled in its construction. The fort was named for Union Army commander General James S. Negley.\n\nWhen the Battle of Nashville finally began in December 1864, it was largely fought on the heights even farther south of the city than Fort Negley, which despite its then-impressive appearance never played a leading military role. Shortly after the war, the fort was abandoned and fell into ruin; however, its outline could be readily discerned for many years afterwards in the encroaching woods. During the Reconstruction period, the area was used as a meeting place for the Ku Klux Klan, as confirmed by former Klansman Marcus B. Toney.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) made a major project of the restoration of Fort Negley. However, almost simultaneous with the completion of this project came the United States' entry into World War II. Neither the manpower, funds, or the interest was available at the time to reopen the fort as an historic or interpretative center. After the war, the fort was allowed to continue to languish, becoming the site of vandalism and minor crime; entry to the site was finally prohibited and the area reverted to forest. However, the surrounding grounds became the site of a municipal park, first as the site of baseball and softball fields for youth and adult leagues, and later as the site of Herschel Greer Stadium, a Minor League Baseball ballpark. The Cumberland Science Museum, a continuation under a new name and in a new venue of the former Nashville Children's Museum (now the Adventure Science Center), was built on the northwestern slope. Most visitors to the stadium and the museum were generally unaware of what was on the wooded hilltop other than it was something which they were not allowed to access.\nAfter years of discussions and negotiations, historic preservationists were successful in getting sufficient funding in the early 2000s for another restoration project, and the fort was reopened to the public for the first time in decades on December 10, 2004. The project went ahead when it was shown that similar places in other cities resulted in more economic stimulation and hence more tax revenue from the resultant tourism than was spent on the maintenance and operation of such sites. The recent restoration was not an attempt to restore the fort completely to its Civil War condition but rather to stabilize the ruins and make them more accessible and visible by removing many of the largest trees and moving some of the blocks back to their original positions; what exists today is a combination of the original fortification and the WPA restoration. In 2007, an additional $1 million in city funds was used to build a visitor's center. More work on the site is planned.\n\nPart of the city's 2017 proposed plan to redevelop the Greer Stadium site, it having sat vacant since 2015, involved highlighting the Fort's history through the creation of educational spaces and interpretive trails and the preservation of the fort and its sightlines. The plan also included redeveloping the adjacent Greer Stadium property to include music and art space, a community center, open park space, retail space, and affordable housing. The presence of significant Civil War and African American historical resources, the city's stated goal of adding 4,500 acres of park land by 2027, and the city's closed-door process of selecting a redevelopment plan were met with criticism. The developers cancelled their plans in January 2018 after archaeologists determined that undisturbed areas on the edge of the Greer property, but not part of the stadium itself, were the unmarked burial sites of slaves forced to build Fort Negley. Mayor Megan Barry expressed her desire that the site honor the history of those who died building the fort.\n\nFort Negley is now listed as a Site of Memory in the Slave Route Project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\n"}

Like Hemingway's Key West home, it is now a museum.\n\nThe house was built in 1886 by Catalan architect Miguel Pascual y Baguer on a hill about east of Havana. From the back veranda and the adjacent tower one has an excellent view of downtown Havana.\n\nHemingway lived in the house from mid-1939 to 1960, first renting it, and then buying it in December 1940 after he married Martha Gellhorn, his third wife. Gellhorn, who had come to Cuba to be with Hemingway, decided that she did not want to live in the small room he rented at the Hotel Ambos Mundos. She found the property for which Hemingway paid $12,500. The \"finca\" at the time consisted of with a farmhouse.\n\nWhile at \"Finca Vigía,\" Hemingway wrote much of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", a novel of the Spanish Civil War which he had covered as a journalist with Gellhorn in the late 1930s. (He had started the novel while living at the Hotel Ambos Mundos, and some of it was written in Idaho.) Hemingway bought the property with some of the first royalties from the book, which was published in 1940. After Hemingway and Gellhorn divorced in 1945, Hemingway kept \"Finca Vigia\" and lived there during the winters with Mary Welsh Hemingway, his last wife.\n\nAt the \"finca\", Hemingway also wrote \"The Old Man and the Sea\" (1951) about a fisherman who lived in the nearby town of Cojimar and worked the waters off Havana.\n\nIn the early 1940s, during the Second World War, Hemingway's three sons often visited him at the \"finca\", sometimes staying in a small house that Martha (\"Marty\") Hemingway had fixed up for them.\n\nThe guest house, a converted one-story wooden garage, is now used as offices for the museum director and staff and for meetings. They reported that the property then was overgrown with \"manigua\" and \"flamboyan\" trees, but that most of the rural land has since been taken over by housing. In those early days there was also a tennis court, a pool and water wells.\n\nAt the \"finca\" Hemingway began to keep and breed cats (in Key West, he had kept only peacocks). There is no evidence that any of Hemingway's Cuban cats were polydactyl. Hemingway started with a gray Angora cat named Princessa (middle cat in photo) obtained in Key West from a breeder, and in 1942 picked up two male Cuban kittens named Good Will and Boise (left and right cats in photo). Hemingway wrote extensively about the habits of Boise. By 1943, the cat population at the \"finca\" numbered 11. When Mary Hemingway moved into the \"finca\" in 1946, she had a workshop tower constructed on the property for Hemingway to write in, but he preferred to work in his bedroom, and the workshop was eventually assigned to the cats. Today, there are no cats on the Cuban property, but there are several at the home in Key West, some with thumbs.\n\nAfter the Cuban revolution ousted the US-backed government in January 1959, Hemingway was on good terms with the new Cuban government. In Havana in the summer of 1960, he presented a trophy to Fidel Castro for winning a sport fishing contest named for Hemingway. Nevertheless, as depression and illness overtook him, Hemingway left Cuba for good on July 25, 1960, leaving behind the home that he had used there for more than 20 years.\n\nIn the fall of 1960, the Cuban government expropriated a great deal of foreign property, including the \"Finca Vigía\". The U.S. government broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1960 and imposed a partial financial embargo. After the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 and Cuba's announcement that it was a Communist state in May, relations between Cuba and the U.S. deteriorated further.\n\nHemingway was being treated for severe depression in the U.S. through the first half of 1961, and the Hemingways could not return to Cuba due to the hostile political climate between the two countries. Hemingway committed suicide at his home in Idaho on July 2, 1961.\n\nThe official Cuban government account is that after Hemingway's death, Mary Hemingway deeded the home, complete with furnishings and library, to the Cuban government, which made it into a museum devoted to the author. Mary Hemingway, however, stated that after Hemingway's death, the Cuban government contacted her in Idaho to report that it intended to expropriate the house, along with all real property in Cuba. Mary Hemingway negotiated with the Castro government for certain easily movable personal property (some paintings and a few books), plus manuscripts deposited in a vault in Havana. Most of the Hemingways' personal property, with no way to move it out of the country at the time, had to be abandoned.\n\nThe home, claimed to be in danger of collapse by the US National Trust for Historic Preservation, was restored by the Cuban government and reopened to tourists in 2007. Even so, it has been listed as one of the 11 most-endangered historic sites, despite being outside the US. Also, it is on the World Monuments Fund's biennial list of \"100 most endangered sites\". Significant disputes and controversies have arisen over the condition of the house and its contents, although researchers who have visited the site have consistently reported that the Cuban government, without funding from the US, has responsibly maintained the house, contents, wooden fishing boat \"Pilar\", and the grounds.\n\nIn a June 2008 newspaper article, Irish thriller writer Adrian McKinty alleged that during a visit to the house, a Cuban secret policeman offered him any book in Hemingway's library for $200.\n\n\n"}

Part of the EMD Dash 2 line, the GP38-2 was an upgraded version of the earlier GP38. Power is provided by an EMD 645E 16-cylinder engine, which generates 2,000 horsepower (1.5 MW).\n\nThe GP38-2W is a Canadian variant of the GP38-2 and a forerunner of today's wide-nose units. It is easily distinguished by its wide-nose Canadian comfort cab. 51 of these locomotives were produced for the Canadian National Railway during 1973–1974.\n\nAlthough a W is commonly suffixed to the name, it is actually an addition by enthusiasts to help specify the presence of a CN-spec comfort cab. No locomotives built using CN's design of comfort cab ever featured a W in their designation, as the presence of the cab did not mechanically alter the locomotive. This is reflected by the lack of the \"W\" in the model designation on the builders' plates of these units.\n\nThere are snow shields above the inertial-filter central air intakes behind the cab; the electrical boxes and equipment blower behind the cab also differ in detail from a standard GP38-2.

Devolution of this monopoly occurs by the principle of jurisprudence in which they rule according to higher law.\n\nTom W. Bell, former director of telecommunications and technology studies at Cato Institute, now a professor of law at Chapman University School of Law in California wrote \"Polycentric Law\", published by the Institute for Humane Studies, when he was a law student at the University of Chicago. In it he notes that others use phrases such as \"non-monopolistic law\" to describe these polycentric alternatives. He outlines traditional customary law (also known as consuetudinary law) before the creation of states, including as described by Friedrich A. Hayek, Bruce L. Benson, and David D. Friedman. He mentions Anglo-Saxon customary law, church law, guild law, and merchant law as examples of polycentric law. He notes that customary and statutory law have co-existed through history, as when Roman law applied to Romans throughout the Roman Empire, but indigenous legal systems were permitted for non-Romans. In \"Polycentric Law in the New Millennium,\" which won first place in the Mont Pelerin Society's 1998 Friedrich A. Hayek Fellowship competition, Bell predicts three areas where polycentric law might develop: alternative dispute resolution, private communities, and the Internet.\n\nThe University of Helsinki (Finland) funded a \"Polycentric Law\" research project from 1992 to 1995, led by professor Lars D. Eriksson. Its goal was to demonstrate \"the inadequacy of current legal paradigms by mapping the indeterminacies of both the modern law and the modern legal theory. It also addressed the possibility of legal and ethical alternativies to the modern legal theories\" and \"provided openings to polycentric legal theories both by deconstructing the idea of unity in law and re-constructing legal and ethical differences\". The project hosted two international conferences. In 1998 the book \"Polycentricity: The Multiple Scenes of Law\", edited by Ari Hirvonen, collected essays written by scholars involved with the project.\n\nProfessor Randy Barnett, who originally wrote about \"non-monopolistic\" law, later used the phrase \"polycentric legal order\". He explains the advantages of such a system in his book \"The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law.\"\n\nBruce L. Benson also uses the phrase, writing in a Cato Institute publication in 2007: \"A customary system of polycentric law would appear to be much more likely to generate efficient sized jurisdictions for the various communities involved—perhaps many smaller than most nations, with others encompassing many of today’s political jurisdictions (e.g., as international commercial law does today).\"\n\nJohn K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung in \"No State Required? A Critical Review of the Polycentric Legal Order,\" criticize the concept of polycentric law.\n\nLegal scholar Gary Chartier in \"Anarchy and Legal Order\" elaborates and defends the idea of law without the state. Animated by a vision of peaceful, voluntary cooperation as a social ideal and building on a careful account of non-aggression, the book seeks to explain why the state is illegitimate, dangerous, and unnecessary. It proposes an understanding of how law enforcement in a stateless society could be legitimate and what the optimal substance of law without the state might be, suggests ways in which a stateless legal order could foster the growth of a culture of freedom, and situates the project it elaborates in relation to leftist, anti-capitalist, and socialist traditions.\n\n\n"}

It was incorporated within the state of Indiana in December 1922 and became a national collegiate sorority on December 30, 1929, when a charter was granted to the Alpha chapter.\n\nThe sorority is a non-profit whose aim is to enhance the quality of life within the community. Public service, leadership development and the education of youth are the hallmark of the organization's programs and activities.\n\nFounded in the midst of segregation, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. is the only sorority of the four historically African-American sororities which comprise the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) established at a predominantly white campus.\n\nSigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. has over 100,000 members with more than 500 undergraduate and alumnae chapters throughout the United States, Bermuda, The Bahamas, Canada, and Korea. Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university, or through an alumnae chapter after earning a college degree. Sigma Gamma Rho also supports two affiliates: youth group of young women called the Rhoers and the Philos, women who are friends of the sorority.\n\nRaised by a family friend because both of her parents were killed when she was three, Founder Little graduated from Shortridge High School in 1915 and received a diploma from the Indianapolis Normal School in 1918. She began her teaching career immediately after graduation. In 1928, Little moved to Los Angeles with her husband and finished her undergraduate training at UCLA. She taught in the Los Angeles School System until her retirement in 1967. The Mary Lou Allison Loving Cup Award is presented at each Boule to the chapter reporting the most successful program. \nAfter graduating from Shortridge High School, Founder Whiteside entered the Indianapolis City Normal School. In 1922, when in training as a cadet teacher, she met the teachers who became her best friends and founders of Sigma Gamma Rho. Ms. Whiteside taught school until 1951 when she retired and later helped her husband to develop a business. She also started her own millinery business and worked with her church and various other organizations. After the death of her husband, she ran their business from 1955 until 1957 and returned to teaching in 1959, where she remained until her retirement in 1970.\nFounder Marbury was born March 11, 1900. She attended Shortridge High School and the Indianapolis City Normal School. She earned her BS in Education from Butler University in June 1931 and her Master's from Columbia University in New York City. She was awarded the Butler Medal, the highest alumni honor at Butler University. Her professional career included teaching at Morehouse College in Atlanta and serving as Director of Practice Training of teachers from Butler University and Indianapolis State University. She taught in the Indianapolis School System for nine years. She organized Public School 87, which grew from a 4-room portable school to 18 rooms and 24 teachers, where she was principal for 48 years until her retirement in 1967. She married in 1929 and is the mother of two children. Founder Marbury died on July 29, 2000. She was the last of the seven founders to join Omega Rho. \nFounder Johnson was born on June 20, 1904, in Indianapolis, Indiana. She received her BS in 1932 and her MS in 1941 from Butler University. She started as a teacher in 1923 and was eventually promoted to principal of one of the largest elementary schools in Indianapolis at the time. She was also very involved with many clubs and organizations dedicated to community service. Ms. Johnson retired in 1966.\nA cum laude graduate of South Bend Central High School, Founder Redford continued her education to receive a B.S from Indiana State Teachers College and a M.S. from Butler University. She also studied at Western Reserve in Cleveland and Indiana University Extension. She taught one year in Terre Haute, and 37 years in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was Grand Epistoleus, Grand Tamiochus, Financial Consultant and received various awards and honors from Sigma Gamma Rho. Plaques are awarded in Ms. Redford's name at each Boule for exhibits of chapter achievements.\nFounder Martin was born on July 12, 1900. The youngest of six children, Ms. Martin attended grade school in Indianapolis. She graduated from the Manual Training High School and the City Teachers Normal. She earned her BS in Education from Butler University in June 1943. Ms. Martin taught at Indianapolis Public School 4 for over 25 years. She married twice and was a devoted wife and hard worker in school and the sorority.\nA graduate of Shortridge High School and the Indianapolis City Normal School, Founder McClure attended Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. She won the Gregg Scholarship which she planned to use to attend Columbia University, but due to illness, she could not accept the scholarship. McClure was talented in art and she helped to design the sorority pin. Ms. McClure died very young on August 24, 1924.\n\nSigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. includes graduate and undergraduate women from a variety of fields. Membership in Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., is by invitation only.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" wrote an article about two serious hazing incidents involving the sorority. In 2008, a pledge at San Jose State University, filed a civil suit against the sorority after being severely beaten, harassed, and threatened to keep the abuse a secret. Four sorority members were arrested and served 90 days in county jail. In 2010 at Rutgers University, six Sigma Gamma Rho women were arrested and charged with a felony after striking one pledge over 200 times which forced her to seek medical attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Power was provided by an EMD 567D2 16-cylinder turbocharged engine which generated . EMD was initially hesitant to turbocharge their 567-series diesel engine, but was spurred on to do so following successful tests made by Union Pacific in the form of UP's experimental \"Omaha GP20\" units. 260 examples of EMD's production locomotive model (with the EMD turbocharger) were built for American railroads.\n\nThe GP20 was the second EMD production locomotive to be built with an EMD turbocharged diesel engine, sixteen months after the six-axle (C-C) model SD24. Power output of the turbocharged SD24 was 33 percent higher than the of the concurrent Roots blower-equipped SD18s with the same engine displacement, per axle, but the power output of the turbocharged GP20 was only 11 percent higher than the of the concurrent Roots blower-equipped GP18s with the same engine displacement per axle, due to the limitations of the traction motors then available. Nevertheless, the turbocharged GP20 provided full rated power at all altitudes, which the Roots-blown GP18 could not provide.\n\nThe turbocharger was the then-new EMD mechanically assisted turbo-compressor. During engine startup, and at lower power levels, during which there is not sufficient exhaust heat energy to drive the turbine fast enough for the compressor to supply the air necessary for combustion, the engine drives the compressor through a gear train and an overrunning clutch. At higher power levels, the overrunning clutch is disengaged, and the turbo-compressor operates as a true turbocharger. It is possible for the turbo-compressor to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power. Turbocharging provides higher horsepower and good running characteristics at all altitudes. Turbocharging also improves fuel consumption and reduces emissions.\n\nPrevious Union Pacific experiments with turbocharging had utilized multiple Elliot or Garrett AiResearch turbochargers feeding the usual pair of Roots blowers. EMD's mechanically assisted turbocharger eliminated the need for the pair of Roots blowers and also integrated the turbocharging function from two (Elliot) or four (AiResearch) smaller add-on turbochargers into one much larger, turbo-compressor (turbocharger) with intercooling.\n\nThe introduction of the EMD-type turbocharger was successful and all subsequent GP series were offered with this turbocharger, although not all models within a series were offered with turbocharging (e.g., the \"38\" sub-models within the \"40 Series\" were Roots-blown).\n\nUnits built for the Great Northern Railway were equipped with high short-hoods and were set up to run long-hood forward with a single control stand. Western Pacific received ten GP20s with high short-hoods and dual control stands, thereby facilitating running both long-hood forward and short-hood forward.\n\nWhile the EMD SD24 with six axles was producing with an engine of the same displacement ( per axle), the four axle GP20 was limited to ( per axle) by the capabilities of the traction motors and the direct current traction generators of the time. In appearance the locomotive was similar to a late version GP9 or GP18 (i.e., often with a low short hood, but with the two exhaust stacks over the engine replaced by a single stack forward over the exit of the turbocharger, in common with later turbocharged EMD locomotives. An identification detail of the GP20 is the small radiator fan added ahead of the large aft fan.\n\nDe-turbo-ed GP20s, which employ 645 power assemblies, with Roots blowers replacing the EMD turbocharger without de-rating the horsepower of the locomotive, are somewhat common. As the reliability of the EMD turbocharger significantly improved over time, these de-turbo-ed examples became less common.\n\nCurrent owners of GP20s include the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway (TP&W). Watco companies operates three GP20s #2001-2003. The Alabama & Tennessee River Railroad (ATN) recently acquired GWR 5625. This unit is a former EMD Demonstrator of the same number. Blacklands operates GP20 #2036 which was originally AT&SF #1152. The Georgia Northeastern operates GP20s #316 and 4125. Those units trace back to Great Northern #2016 and Southern Pacific #7205. The Sierra Railroad (Sierra Northern Railway (SERA)) operates GP20s ex-AT&SF 1162/3062 and ex AT&SF 1130/3030 (Currently as #48 & #50), as well as RJ Corman Railroad GP20#4121.\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently third in all-time professional football passing yards and second in all-time CFL passing yards after he was surpassed for first place by the Montréal Alouettes' Anthony Calvillo on October 10, 2011. He is pro-football's combined passing & rushing leader with a total of 84,301 yards. Allen retired as professional football's all-time leading passer with 72,381 passing yards after he surpassed Warren Moon's total of 70,553 yards (in both the CFL and NFL combined) on September 4, 2006 in the annual Labour Day Classic. He also retired in third place in all-time CFL rushing yards with 11,920 yards, behind Mike Pringle and George Reed. The 2007 season marked Allen's twenty-third season in the CFL and he officially announced his retirement on May 28, 2008 at age 44. Allen is the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen.\n\nAllen has been mentioned as one of the greatest CFL quarterbacks of all time after winning four Grey Cups with three different teams. He also was a three time Grey Cup MVP. In 2005, he was the CFL Most Outstanding Player at 42 years old, becoming the second oldest MVP of any North American sports franchise (oldest is Gordie Howe of the Houston Aeros of the World Hockey Association, MVP at age 46 in 1974). He was a formidable passer and rusher, as he retired only 323 yards behind his brother Marcus. In 2012, he was elected into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn May 2010, Allen launched the Damon Allen Quarterback Academy , in which he personally teaches the skills and strategies of quarterbacking to students of all ages and skill levels.\n\nDamon has three daughters and a son. They live in Oakville, Ontario.\n\nAllen started playing football by the age of six for Valencia Park's Pop Warner in San Diego. Allen played safety on defense. In the Junior Peewee league, in his first year as a quarterback, Allen's team won the championships. This was followed by two undefeated seasons, and winning the Junior Peewee league title for three years in a row.\n\nIn high school, Damon Allen was a fine two sport athlete. In football he was the starting quarterback at Lincoln High School. He had a 22-2 record as starting quarterback at Lincoln High. Allen was a first team all-CIF player and Tribune Athlete of the Year. He led his team to consecutive 2A Division CIF Football Championships In baseball, Allen was a pitcher with a record of 14-2, and his Lincoln High baseball team was rated #1 in San Diego County with a record of 24-4. He was a First team All-CIF Utility Man which also made him Tribune Athlete of the Year in his senior year.\n\nDamon went on to play college football for California State University, Fullerton. There, Allen led the Titans to two Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA) championships. He also broke a 26-year-old NCAA record throwing only three passes that were intercepted, in over 300 attempts and broke seven school records. He was a first team PCAA quarterback, and was named the UPI All West Coast team quarterback along with UNLV's Randall Cunningham.\n\nAllen was sixteenth in overall voting for the 1984 Heisman Trophy. He also played in the Senior Bowl college All-Star game (completing 6 for 8 passes for 50 yards, 1 touchdown, and rushing for 20 yards on 3 carries).\n\nAllen was not only an outstanding football player, he was also a superior baseball player. He helped his Titans' baseball team win the 1984 College World Series, leading his team to a regular season record of 66-20 as a pitcher. He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 1984 Major League Baseball Draft in the seventh round, the same year the Tigers won the Major League Baseball World Series. Allen never signed a professional, major league baseball contract with the Tigers, but did sign one with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1993. Allen reported to the Pirates' spring training camp in 1994, but ultimately left their camp and decided to play pro football.\n\nAllen joined the CFL as a free-agent in 1985, signed by the Edmonton Eskimos, and threw for 661 yards and three touchdowns in his rookie season as a back-up to Matt Dunigan. In the 1987 season, Allen played in the Grey Cup championship game, replacing the injured starter Dunigan, and led the Eskimos to a Grey Cup victory, defeating the Toronto Argonauts 38-36, at Vancouver's BC Place Stadium. His first Grey Cup win, Allen earned Grey Cup Most Valuable Player honours in the championship.\nIn 1989, Allen signed with the Ottawa Rough Riders. In 1991, Allen was named an Eastern Division All-Star for the first time in his CFL career. During the 1991 season, Allen rushed for a career-high 1,036 yards and 8 touchdowns in 18 games, and passed for a then career-high 4,275 yards with 24 touchdowns.\n\nIn 1992, Allen signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In 18 games, Allen threw for 3,858 and 19 touchdowns, and rushed for 850 yards and 7 touchdowns, in his only season in \"Steeltown.\" After the 1992 season, Allen was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos.\n\nIn 1993, in his second time around with Edmonton, Allen helped the Eskimos to victory in the Grey Cup game, winning his second title, and was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player in a 33-23 win over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. In 1994, Allen led the Esks to the Western Division Semi-Finals, only to lose to the BC Lions.\n\nIn 1995, Allen signed as a free-agent with the Memphis Mad Dogs. He appeared in 15 games with the CFL expansion team, and threw for 3,211 yards and 11 touchdowns on 228 of 390 passing. Allen also rushed for 427 yards in his only professional season in the United States.\n\nIn 1996, Allen joined the BC Lions.\n\nIn 1999, Allen was voted to the CFL's West Division All-Star team. He threw for 4,219 yards on 315 of 521 passing with 22 touchdowns, ran the ball 136 times for 785 yards and 8 touchdowns, and threw for more than 300 yards on five occasions.\nIn 2000, Allen became the CFL's all-time leading passer on October 28 against Hamilton, throwing for 345 yards to surpass Ron Lancaster's previous record of 50,535 yards. Allen completed 324 of 525 passes (61.7%) to lead the CFL with a career-high 4,840 passing yards. Allen was nominated as the Lions' Most Outstanding Player at the CFL Player Awards. Allen captured his first Grey Cup with the Lions (third of his career) throwing for 234 yards in a win over the Montreal Alouettes.\n\nIn 2003, after the acquisition of Dave Dickenson as their new quarterback, the 39-year-old Allen was traded from the BC Lions to the Toronto Argonauts for a second-round draft pick in the 2004 CFL Draft, and a third-round pick in the 2005 CFL Draft. Allen's Argonaut re-debut was a 20-18 season- opening loss to the Saskatchewan Roughriders that also marked Allen's 300th regular season game of his CFL career. In Week 7, Allen became only the third quarterback in professional football history to pass for 60,000 yards against his former club, the BC Lions. In a Week 17 loss to the Ottawa Renegades, Allen completed 20 of 39 pass attempts for 203 yards, with 2 interceptions and 1 touchdown, giving Allen 334 career touchdown passes, and surpassing Ron Lancaster for the most career touchdown passes in CFL history. Allen would lead the Argos to the Eastern Division Final that year as well.\n\nIn Week 9 of the 2004 season versus Montreal, Allen exited the game in the third quarter with a fractured left tibia, and spent Weeks 10-16 on the injured reserve roster. There was considerable concern that Allen, at 41 years of age, would never come back from such a severe injury, but he did. In Week 17, Allen dressed as the third quarterback (behind Michael Bishop and Romaro Miller) for a game against the BC Lions. In Week 18, Allen dressed as the backup quarterback behind Michael Bishop and entered the game versus the Calgary Stampeders at the end of the second quarter. Allen completed his first thirteen pass attempts, making him the second quarterback in Argonaut history (Mike Rae, 17 of 17 versus Montreal, August 12, 1975) to complete more than 12 passes consecutively in a game. Allen finished the game with 18 of 23 pass completions, and his 82.6% completion percentage ranks fourth in Argo history for a single game.\n\nIn the 2004 Grey Cup Championship against the BC Lions, Allen was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player for third time in his legendary career. Allen led the Argos to their fifteenth Grey Cup Championship and won his fourth championship. Allen finished the game with 23 of 34 pass completions for 299 yards (longest gain, 34 yards) and 1 touchdown pass, and rushed 5 times for 10 yards (longest gain, 5 yards) and 2 rushing touchdowns.\n\nAllen continued his assault on the record books during the 2005 CFL season. On October 27, 2005, Damon reached the 5,000-yard passing plateau for the first time in his 21-year CFL career by posting a 34-11 victory against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The win guaranteed Toronto a first-place finish in the CFL East plus home field advantage in the playoffs. The game took place before 40,085 fans; the largest crowd for a CFL game in Toronto since 1992. However, the Argonauts were defeated 33-17 in the 2005 East Final by the Montreal Alouettes, thereby thwarting their hopes of repeating their 2004 Grey Cup win.\n\nIn 2005, Allen won his first CFL's Outstanding Player Award. In that year, he also hosted the inaugural \"Damon Allen Quarterback Challenge\" which featured top CFL quarterbacks participating in various skill competitions. In the Quarterback Challenge's second year, Allen won the event.\n\nIn 2006, Allen started the opening home game of the season against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and broke the middle finger on his right hand on Toronto's third play. Allen was injured trying to break his fall after taking a late hit from Hamilton safety Wayne Shaw, who was penalized on the play. Allen missed nearly a month and a half of action with a broken finger, returning on July 29 vs. the BC Lions.\nOn September 4, 2006, at the Labour Day Classic against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Allen broke Warren Moon's record (70,553 yards) to become professional football's all-time passing leader. The record-setting completion, a 29-yard shovel pass to wide receiver Arland Bruce III, took place at 5:02 of the third quarter. The game was suspended briefly for a presentation by CFL Commissioner Tom Wright. Allen's triumphant pose with the record-breaking football was captured by a photographer and later released by the Argos as a commemorative poster on their website.\n\nIn November, 2006 was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#14) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network The Sports Network/TSN.\n\nOn January 18, 2007 Damon underwent successful surgery to repair the middle finger of his (right) throwing hand and was back in the gym training, in less than 24 hours.\n\nOn February 28, 2007 Allen re-signed a contract with the Argonauts for one year plus an option .\n\nAllen started the 2007 season as the Argos starting quarterback beating out Michael Bishop and former NFL starter Mike McMahon. However, he was replaced in the third quarter of the first game by Bishop despite having gone 14-18, 130 yards and a touchdown. Allen was then bumped down to third on the depth chart. However, after Bishop went down with a wrist injury and McMahon failed to impress, Allen stepped into the starting role once again. However, in his first game back as starter he injured his toe. Allen was placed on the nine-game injured list and Rocky Butler took over as the Argos starting quarterback\n\nAllen announced that his retirement as a player on May 28, 2008, but will stay with the Argos as a special advisor to CEO Pinball Clemons.\n\nIn 2018, Allen was inducted into the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\n"}

Total production of the GP40-2 and its variations totalled 1,143 units.\n\nAlthough the GP40-2 was a sales success, it sold fewer units than the earlier GP40 and the contemporary GP38-2 and SD40-2 models. The popularity of high-horsepower 4-axle diesels began to decline with the GP40-2, with 6-axle models gaining in popularity for their superior low-speed lugging performance.\n\nLike the SD40-2 the GP40-2 has a reputation for reliability, and many are still in use. Changes such as the modular electronics system improved reliability over the GP40. Their high power-per-axle rating suited them to high-speed service rather than low-speed drag freights.\n\nWith the usual 62:15 gearing (65-70 mph maximum) EMD rated the GP40-2 at 55,400 lb continuous tractive effort; for compatibility with other units, most (all?) had the PF21 module that reduced horsepower below 23 mph, bringing the minimum continuous speed down to 11 mph.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Essentially this locomotive was an EMD SD35 equipped with a steam generator, located in the extended long hood end, for passenger use. 35 examples of this locomotive model were built for American railroads.\n\nWith its older E-units reaching the end of their serviceable lives, Seaboard Air Line asked EMD for a passenger version of the SD35 that could double as a freight unit, especially if passenger trains continued to be discontinued. EMD came up with the SDP35, and SAL placed an order, trading in E4 and E6 units. The first of SAL's new SDP35s was delivered in summer 1964. Eventually the SDP35 wound up going to four railroads: SAL (20, numbered 1100–1119), Atlantic Coast Line (1, numbered 550), Louisville and Nashville (4, numbered 1700–1703) and Union Pacific (10, numbered 1400–1409).\n\nThe SD35 and SDP35 were so similar that EMD published a single operator's manual to cover both.\n\nAlthough SAL successfully used the SDP35 in high-speed passenger service as well as on expedited freight and piggyback trains, Union Pacific found it unsuitable and relegated its entire fleet to freight service while its famous yellow E-units continued to handle passengers. With the July 1, 1967 Seaboard Coast Line merger, SAL units received passenger numbers 601-620 and also served SCL in both high-speed freight service and on passenger trains. With the arrival of Amtrak, SCL renumbered them into the freight series and numbers 1951–1970. Later in their SCL years, they were renumbered again and assigned into the heavy yard duty and assigned 4500-series numbers. ACL's lone unit was renumbered 1099 when the line acquired former MKT E8s. At the SCL merger, it was assigned number 600 and then later received SCL number 1950.\nLouisville & Nashville's four SDP35s (1700–1703), ordered in spring 1964 to replace aging E and F units in passenger service, were completed and delivered without steam generation equipment installed, after approval of several passenger train cancellations from government regulatory agencies during the locomotives' assembly, leaving L&N with a surplus of passenger locomotives.

These included six-axle models SD38, SD40, SDP40 and SD45. All shared standardized components, including the frame, cab, generator, trucks, traction motors, and air brakes. The primary difference was the power output: SD38 = from a non-turbocharged V16, SD40 = from a turbocharged V16, and SD45 = from a turbocharged V20.\n\n856 examples of this locomotive model were built for American railroads, 330 were built for Canadian railroads, 72 were built for Mexican railroads, 6 were built for the Guinea-Boke Project, and 4 SD40Ms riding on gauge trucks were exported to Brazil.\n\nBuilt by EMD at McCook, Illinois\nBuilt by GMD at London, Ontario\nMexican SD40's Built by EMD at McCook, Illinois or GMD at London, Ontario\nPhases are as listed by Robert Sarberenyi. \n\nThe very first test bed SD40, EMD 434, constructed on an SD35 frame in July 1964 was in active service until retired by Canadian National Railway in March 2009 and donated to the Monticello Railway Museum in July 2009, albeit having been upgraded to an \"SD40-2R\", as Illinois Central 6071. \n\n18 customized SD40s were built for the Illinois Central Railroad as model SD40A, using the longer SDP45 frame, which allowed for a larger 5,000 gallon fuel tank.\n\nVersions of the SD40 modified for the Australian loading gauge were sold to WAGR and Victorian Railways as their L and C classes respectively.\n\nThe SD40 was succeeded by an upgraded Dash 2 version called the SD40-2.\n\nAfter having been succeeded by the more modern SD40-2, a large number of SD40 have been upgraded with more modern equipment. The main difference between rebuilt SD40 and genuine SD40-2 is that the latter use a longer frame and has longer front and rear porches, while the rebuilt SD40 have a shorter frame \n\nA common product of rebuilding SD40s, and sometimes SD40-2s, is an SD40-3. The major addition denotes that the rebuilt unit or units as an SD40-3 is the addition of a micro-processor, and sometimes other modern components. The usual reasons for installing a micro-processor are improved traction control, and better fuel economy (via better injection control). Also, electronic control over braking systems (independent and automatic).

They included six-axle models SD38, SD40 and SD45, in addition to SDP40. All had standard components including the frame, cab, generator, trucks, traction motors, and air brakes. The main difference was the power: SD38 = from a non-turbocharged V16, SD40 = from a turbocharged V16, and SD45 = from a turbocharged V20.\n\nThe SD40 and SDP40 were so similar that EMD published common operator's and service manuals to cover both.\n\nAt the time most passenger locomotives needed to provide steam to the passenger cars for heating, cooking, and sometimes cooling. They needed a higher gear ratio for faster running, the graduated-release feature on the air brakes, and type F tightlock couplers to keep equipment together in the event of a derailment. To fit a steam generator to the freight-only SD40, the designers had to move the machinery forward about on the frame, add a compartment behind the radiators for the boiler, and divide the fuel tank into fuel and water sections.\n\nEarlier passenger diesels, like EMD E8, ALCO PA, FM Erie-built and Baldwin Sharknose locomotives, were streamlined cab units designed for visual appeal and the appearance of speed. The SDP40 and the SDP35 & SDP45 instead have the same appearance as their freight counterparts. This look was contemporary to, and eventually overtaken by cowl units like the GE U30CG and EMD FP45, SDP40F and F40PH.\n\nVisually, the locomotive is a hood unit distinguished only by the shape of its rear end behind the radiators, with its flat end having no number boards, shuttered boiler air intake on each side, extra exhaust stacks over the boiler, cantilevered walkway around the flat end, and very steep rear steps. EMD applied this same end to the passenger SDP35, SDP45, and GP40P locomotives, as well as the freight DD35, DDA40X and SD40T-2.\n\nAmtrak's SDP40F locomotive, although sharing several mechanical specifications, is visually a much different locomotive. Seven years separate their introductions, and the SDP40F was actually based on the SD40-2. It had a full-width carbody, similar to the FP45. It was also longer than the SDP40.\n\nGreat Northern Railway (GN) purchased the first six SDP40s in 1966, to replace older E-units on their \"Western Star\" and smaller regional trains. Options included Vapor OK-4740 steam generators, water-transfer capability between units, 59:18 gearing for a top speed of , and Type-F couplers. These were followed in 1967 by eight more powerful SDP45 locomotives ordered for the \"Empire Builder\". After the startup of Amtrak in 1971, Great Northern's successor Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) converted the locomotives to freight service.\n\nOne SDP40, former GN 323, was temporarily renumbered BN 1976 and painted in red, white and blue for the United States Bicentennial in 1976.\n\nNdeM had ten units delivered in 1968 and another four in 1970. In 1998, the government of Mexico privatized the NdeM the locomotives were split between two successor companies. Eight went to TFM, which was later purchased by Kansas City Southern Railway and became KCSM. Of those eight, two were rebuilt to SD22ECOs, and the other six were scrapped. The remaining six went to Ferromex. Of those six, four were rebuilt to SDP40-2s and remain in service, the other two were scrapped.\n\n<br>\n\nOn August 23, 1979, BN 6399 was the lead unit of train 23 when it ran head-on into train 182 at Maiden Rock, WI. 6399 was repaired and returned to service, as were the four units of the other train. The three trailing GP40 units were destroyed.\n\nA consideration when rebuilding an SDP40 is that the rear corner steps do not comply with current Federal Regulations. The bottom step must be further out than the upper steps to provide a place to stand. Since the steam generator compartment extends to the end of the frame, it must be removed to install compliant switching steps. FXE 3212 and GCFX 3093 are examples. See:\n\nThe \"KCS pair\" rebuilt into SD22ECOs took a different approach: The bottom steps of the rear ladders were moved out to meet the requirement.\n\nBNSF Railway donated #6327 - former GN 325 and their last SDP40 in service - to the Minnesota Transportation Museum in May 2009. Since then, it has been in service on the Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway. The Museum has renumbered the locomotive back to 325 and, in the future, it will be repainted in the Great Northern \"Big Sky Blue\" paint scheme.\n\n\n"}

Reliability was not as high as anticipated; the twenty-cylinder prime mover was prone to crankshaft failure from engine block flex. Though it produced more than the 16-645E3 in the SD40, some railroads felt the extra horsepower wasn't worth it, even after EMD strengthened the block to eliminate crankshaft failures. At low speeds, when tractive effort was adhesion-limited, the SD45 provided no advantage over the SD40.\n\nBuyers included the Burlington Northern, Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, Pennsylvania Railroad, the Great Northern Railway, Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific Railway. (Contrary to enthusiast legend the SD45 was not a \"fuel guzzler.\" It produced marginally more power per unit of fuel than its counterpart, the SD40. It did consume more fuel at idle than the 16 cylinder prime mover in the SD40, and at the time US railroads typically left a locomotive idling when not in use.) Many SD45s still exist, some rebuilt with sixteen-cylinder 645s for lease companies. SD45s and SD45-2s owned by Montana Rail Link retain their 20-cylinder prime movers. Wisconsin Central used to roster a large fleet of SD45s, but its sale to CN has resulted in the retirement of the entire fleet, with mass scrappings.

This unit used the same frame as the EMD SD40-2 and EMD SD38-2. The largest owner of the SD45-2 was the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe with 90 units, the Clinchfield had 18 units, Seaboard Coast line had 15 units and Erie Lackawanna rostered 13 units.\n\nA few cabless SD45-2Bs were built by Santa Fe from units undergoing remanufacturing. In all but one case (5510), the dynamic brakes were moved to the opposite end of the hood from the radiators; they were originally near the center of the hood. With no cab, these B-units are controlled from other locomotives.\n\nIn September 2015, Norfolk Southern revealed its SD45-2 numbered 1700 painted back to its Erie Lackawanna color scheme at Chattanooga, Tennessee. This is the second unit from an NS predecessor painted back into its original colors.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, CSX donated former SD45-2 #8954 (ex: SCL #2049) to the Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Ga, making it the first SD45-2 to be preserved.\n"}

It depicts Darth Vader's ongoing quest to seek out and destroy any Jedi who may have escaped the great purge years ago.\n\n\"Knightquest\" is notable among fanfilms for having been shot on film, as opposed to the more common digital video. It was also mastered in THX Dolby Surround, and features a special \"Star Wars\" themed THX introduction before the film.\n\nThe film has been generally well received by fans, and has been consistently mentioned in the press as a turning point in the development of fanfilms. The film has also won several awards, including Best Actress and Best Special Effects in the 2001 Force 3.75 Australian Fanfilm Festival.\n\nThe film's entire budget of $12,000 went to vendors for camera and equipment rental, film, costume and prop creation, location permits, hotel rooms and food. The entire cast and crew worked for free.\n\nFilming began on October 31, 1998 and lasted four days. Pick-ups were done in December of that year and again in March 1999.

The company owns several non-fiction and entertainment-based television brands, including its namesake A&E, History, Lifetime, FYI, and their associated sister channels, and holds stakes in or licenses their international branches.\n\nA&E was formed from the merger of the Alpha Repertory Television Service and the Entertainment Channel, a premium cable channel, in 1984 with their respective owners keeping stakes in the new company. Thus A&E's shareholders were Hearst and ABC (from ARTS) and Radio City Music Hall (Rockefeller Group) and RCA, then the parent of NBC (from Entertainment Channel). The company launched Arts & Entertainment Network, a cultural cable channel, on February 1, 1984.\n\nIn 1990, after having aired episodes of its original 1960's version starting in 1987, A&E acquired rights to, and started producing new episodes of, the documentary series \"Biography\"— which became the channel's flagship program. The network also introduced its own companion magazine \"A&E Monthly\".\n\nThe company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993; it purchased the Lou Reda Productions documentary library and long-term rights for the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive. In June 1993, the Rockefeller Group's Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake in A&E to the other three partners (now including NBC in place of RCA after GE's purchase of the latter in 1986) with NBC owning 25% and the other two 37.5% each. Also that month, a new production unit was set up.\n\nThe A&E channel expanded to Canada, and later Mexico from 1993 to 1994. \"Biography\" began airing 5 nights a week in 1994. Also in 1994, A&E, on its 10th anniversary, changed its name from Arts and Entertainment to A&E.\n\nThe A&E company launched The History Channel on January 1, 1995, with its UK counterpart following on November 1 in partnership with British Sky Broadcasting. A&E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to a lack of international rights to A&E international co-productions. As expected, the History Channel led A&E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997), and in Canada (1997). By 1997, the company had started its AETN International division.\n\nFormerly only direct sales, A&E Home Video initiated a six-month trial in which Barnes & Noble would sell the \"Biography\" line in stores, which became permanent in 1996. THC debuted in two other media in September 1996 with a radio program on ABC Radio Networks and Border Books stocking THC videos.\n\nThe 'Biography' franchise continued to expand with a website in July 1996, a children's version launched in fall 1996, an audiotape line in 1997, telefilm development, a Crown published short biography line and debuted its magazine which replaced A&E Monthly. During the 1998–1999 season, \"Biography: American Justice\" and \"Biography Movies\" debuted.\n\nHistory expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), \"History Channel Traveler\", and a planned quarterly magazine.

Following the deal, Disney and Hearst each held approximately 42% of the combined company, while NBC Universal retained approximately 16%. The deal included mechanisms by which NBCU could choose, or alternatively be forced to, exit the partnership over the subsequent 15 years. In May 2011, A&E Television Networks changed its brand name to A+E Networks. A&E dropped TV as their brands had moved beyond just the TV channel while keeping Networks being contemporary to similar companies.\n\nIn July 2012, NBC confirmed plans to divest its 15.8% stake in A&E Networks by way of a share repurchase by A&E Networks, making Disney and Hearst 50-50 partners in the joint venture.

A&E led a Series A funding round for Atlas Obscura in mid-2017. AETN in November 2017 took a substantial minority stake in Dan Abrams’s LawNewz Network live court content website, which then renamed its website to Law&Crime Network.\n\nIn a 2017 agreement, A&E Networks took a 25 share in National Women's Soccer League, created NWSL Media (the league's commercial unit), sleeve sponsor and became its national broadcast partner for three years, carrying the game on Lifetime. In February 2019, A&E ended the pact early and returned its 25% equity in the league, while continuing Lifetime's sleeve sponsorship.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2017, A&E Networks relaunched the Biography franchise with a set of two-hour specials and a miniseries for three of its channels, A&E, History and Lifetime. The franchise's TV programming will be recurring multi-formatted and tie into important anniversaries, newly found information about notables and current news. The initial set has the commonality of being crime centered, with at least one future set would focus on notable women. A&E Networks held its first convention, Alien Con, October 28–30, 2016 in partnership with Cosmic Con as an extension of the History channel's \"Ancient Aliens\" TV series.\n\nIn March 2018, Dubuc resigned as CEO.

Power was provided by an EMD 645E3 20-cylinder engine which generated .\n\nAfter sponsoring the development of the FP45 passenger locomotive, the Santa Fe requested a similar freight locomotive from Electro-Motive. Where the FP45 was an SDP45 wrapped in a full-width cowl carbody, the new F45 was essentially an SD45 given the same treatment.\n\nWhere the Santa Fe requested a full-width carbody for aesthetics, the Great Northern saw an opportunity to protect crews from the dangers of winter operation in northern climates.\n\nThe Santa Fe ordered two lots of twenty each, for 1968 delivery. The FP45s were delivered in Santa Fe's red, yellow and silver \"warbonnet\" colors, the forty F45s came in the blue and yellow freight colors. The second order of F45s were equipped with steam lines so that they could be used as trailing units on passenger consists.\n\nGreat Northern (GN) ordered an initial lot of six, for 1969 delivery. These were numbered immediately following a previous lot of SD45s. Another lot of eight was ordered before the first six arrived. All were factory-painted in the GN's blue, white and grey \"Big Sky Blue\" colors.\n\nGN ordered twelve more for 1970 delivery - they were to be numbered 441-452 - but the GN merged into the Burlington Northern (BN) prior to delivery, so they arrived with BN numbers and BN's green, white and black \"Cascade Green\" colors.\n\nBN followed with a final order for twenty in 1971. Afterwards they returned to ordering SD45s. This final order differed in several small ways from the GN specs.\n\nMorrison-Knudsen purchased seven from the Santa Fe in February 1994 for their lease fleet. 5950, 5952, 5958, 5962, 5968, 5969 and 5960 became MKCX 5525-5531 and served both the Southern Pacific and the Utah Railway in patched blue and yellow warbonnets. 5531 was repainted in Utah Railway red and grey and renumbered 9013, until returned in October 2001. The rest were ultimately scrapped.\n\nSanta Fe sold 21 SDF45s to Morrison-Knudsen in April 1994, then leased them back. They retained their Santa Fe colors but were sub-lettered \"\"MKM\". MK was responsible for maintenance.\n\nWisconsin Central purchased six SDF45s from Santa Fe in 1995. 5959 and 5972 became 6631-6632 in 1994, then 6653 and 6655 in 1995. 5955, 5956, 5965 and 5981 became 6650, 6651, 6654 and 6656 in 1995. (6652 was WC's lone SDFP45.) All were painted in WC's maroon and gold. After CN purchased the WC in October 2001, all were retired between November 2001 and February 2002.\n\nThree Santa Fe SDF45s numbered 5953, 5970 and 5975 were conveyed to the BNSF in the 1996 merger and were renumbered BNSF 6550-6552. They were retired in May 2002.\n\nFour BN F45s that were retired in 1984, were picked up by NRE. In cooperation with Helm, they were leased to Utah Railway from April 1985 until April 1991 as NHL 6606, 6607, 6608 and 6613. All were subsequently scrapped.\n\nAnother four BN F45s, 6609-6612, were purchased by Canadian National in June 1994 for parts. 6610 and 6612 were scrapped in 1989, but the bodies of 6609 and 6611 lingered for years outside the shops in Montreal.\n\nAfter retirement, BN 6614-6625 were picked up by the South Shore. Plans were to operate six in coal service and cannibalize the rest for parts. 6620 and one other saw service. After a major failure the plans changed, and all were sold for scrap in November 1986.\n\nBN 6627 was purchased by Doyle McCormack in March 1987. He painted it in Southern Pacific \"Daylight\" colors, arranged according to the New York Central \"lightning stripes\" scheme, and numbered it 743.\n\nTranscisco Tours purchased BN 6635 and 6642, and later Doyle McCormack's 743, for excursions. They became MCHX 1001-1003, and were painted in red and blue with grey & black pinstripes. Transisco installed HEP generators to power the passenger cars. After plans fell through, Wisconsin Southern purchased them in January 1992 and applied their red and silver colors. The units proved too heavy for regular service, although they were used for special events and leased to the BN from October 1993 to April 1994.\n\nThe Susquehanna purchased BN 6640 and 6644 in November 1986. They were repainted in yellow and black. 6640 became NYSW 3636, and 6644 NYSW 6370, then 3638. For a short time 6635 and 6642 were leased from NRE as well. 3636 was leased to sister regional TP&W in 1998 and 1999, and eventually retired in 2002.\n\nMontana RailLink purchased Susquehanna 3638 in October 1993. It was repainted in their dark blue and black and numbered 390. Then in April 1994 they purchased all three of the Wisconsin Southern units, which after repainting they became 391-393. 390 was upgraded with a Q-Tron microprocessor and redesignated an F45MP. BN, their original owner, has leased 391-393 for short periods when short of power. 393 was also leased to sister road IMRL from 1997 to 2001.\n\nIn 1982 and 1983, Santa Fe's San Bernardino shops rebuilt F45s 5900-5939. They emerged as 5950-5989, were painted in a blue and yellow version of the \"warbonnet\", and were redesignated SDF45s. Electrically they were upgraded to SD45-2 standards. Mechanically, they were re-geared from 59:18 to 60:17, reducing their top speed from .\n\nIn the mid 1980s Santa Fe again re-geared them - this time to 62:15 for .\n\nMotivePower Industries used their 5989 as an EPA Tier-I emissions test bed in 2002. Metra in Chicago had ordered 27 MP36PH-3 passenger locomotives for commuter service. To test their emissions, 5989's 20-645-E3 was replaced with the MP36PH-3's 16-645-F3B and cooling system, and its traction motors removed.\n\nGN 438, later BN 6611, became a load-test box at the Alstom shop in Montreal.\n\nMorrison-Knudsen used the cowls from several scrapped BN F45s to rebuild eleven GP40s into GP40FH-2 locomotives for New Jersey Transit. 4130-4139 were completed in 1987, and 4141 in 1989. (New cowls were fabricated for 4140 and 4142-4144.)\n\nMorrison-Knudsen used both cowls and cabs from scrapped BN F45s, to construct five F40PHL-2 locomotives on GP40 frames. They are Tri-rail 801-805, completed in 1988.\n\nRevelstoke Limited LLC purchased a former Santa Fe F45 in June 2008 and restored it externally as Great Northern 441 (GN's last F45 was 440); it was the first locomotive in 40 years to be painted in GN's \"Big Sky Blue\" colors. It has been converted to a Luxury Locomotive Lodge at the Izaak Walton Inn at Essex, Montana. It arrived at Essex on August 26, 2009, and became available for lodging in January 2010. The interior can sleep up to four people and includes a living room, kitchen, master bedroom and bath. The cab has been restored to the current BNSF Railway specification for new and re-manufactured locomotives. It is believedto be the only locomotive in the world that has been converted to living space available for rent. The locomotive was originally built as Santa Fe 1910, later 5910, later 5960, built by EMD in June 1968, serial number 34046. More recently it was Morrison-Knudsen 5531, then Utah Railway 9013.\n\nDynamic Railway Preservation was raising money to acquire and restore Montana Rail Link F45 #390, formerly Burlington Northern #6644. The project ended in 2014 when the locomotive was eventually sold to another private owner, and the money that was raised was used to restore SDP40F #644.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1987147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987147", "title": "EMD SDP40F", "text": "EMD SDP40F\n\nThe EMD SDP40F is a six-axle C-C diesel–electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) from 1973–1974. EMD built 150 for Amtrak, the operator of most intercity passenger trains in the United States. Amtrak, a private company but funded by the United States government, had begun operation in 1971 with a fleet of aging diesel locomotives inherited from various private railroads. The SDP40F was the first diesel locomotive built new for Amtrak and for a brief time they formed the backbone of the company's long-distance fleet.\n\nA series of derailments in the mid-1970s shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, the weight of the water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.\n\nAmtrak took over operation of most intercity rail passenger service in the United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their second generation passenger locomotives for freight service, or to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these intercity services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran E units and F units, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.\n\nThe SDP40F was a full-width cowl unit. It was based on the EMD FP45 passenger locomotive and EMD SD40-2 freight locomotive. All three shared the EMD 645E3 diesel prime mover, which developed . The locomotive had a gear ratio of 57:20. Maximum speed at full horsepower was ; the locomotive exceeded in tests. There were doubts at the time about Amtrak's long-term viability, so the locomotives were designed for easy conversion to freight locomotives should Amtrak cease operation.\n\nIn the early 1970s Amtrak's passenger car fleet was still steam-heated; Amtrak's requirement called for two steam generators. These were located at the rear of the locomotive. Forward of the generators was a water tank. Critically, this tank rested above the floorline; the lateral motion of the water within would later be implicated in a string of derailments. The primary underbody tank was split between water and diesel fuel, carrying of water and of diesel. Provision was made for eventual conversion to head-end power (HEP), but it was never carried out.\n\nEMD based the SDP40F name on the existing SDP40. Several years earlier, EMD had made similar versions of the SDP45 and SD45 in a full-width cowl unit, which it named FP45 and F45. Although the SDP40F was externally nearly identical to the FP45, EMD chose not to give the new locomotive a similar name such as FP40. EMD wanted to avoid adding a new locomotive type to their catalog due to price controls in effect in the early 1970s. The following year, the F40C name was used for a similar locomotive ordered by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the \"Milwaukee Road\"), equipped with HEP instead of steam generators.\n\nThere were several minor differences between the first 40 locomotives built and later examples. The most important was the installation of lower-profile cooling fans and air horns in order to avoid clearance problems in the Eastern United States.\n\nAmtrak ordered 150 SDP40Fs, in two batches. The first order, placed on November 2, 1972, was for 40 locomotives, at a cost of $18 million. A second order, for 110 locomotives at $50 million, followed on October 12, 1973. These orders were Amtrak's first for new-build locomotives. Amtrak deployed the original 40 locomotives on long-distance trains in the Western United States. The locomotives entered revenue service on June 22, 1973, hauling the \"Super Chief\" from Chicago to Los Angeles over the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. SDP40Fs were also used on the Burlington Northern Railroad. The arrival of the second order enabled Amtrak to deploy the SDP40Fs throughout the country, displacing the inherited E-units.\n\nIn late 1975 J. David Ingles called the SDP40Fs the \"stars of Amtrak's long-distance trains,\" but engine crews reported that the locomotives rode poorly compared to the E-units they had replaced. Even as Amtrak and EMD investigated the ride quality, the SDP40F was involved in a series of derailments that would lead to an end to its career as a passenger locomotive. Between 1974–1976 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) identified thirteen incidents for which the locomotive was responsible. None of the incidents were serious, but their frequency was a concern. Most of the derailments occurred on trains with two SDP40Fs on the front and at least one trailing baggage car. While the rear truck of the second locomotive and the front truck of the baggage car were pinpointed as the source of the derailment, the actual cause of the derailments was unclear.\n\nEMD, Amtrak, the Association of American Railroads (AAR), and the FRA tested the locomotive thoroughly, with suspicion falling on the \"hollow bolster\" truck design. In the end, the investigators theorized that the steam generators and water tank may have made the rear of the engine too heavy and created too much lateral motion. Later FRA investigations concluded that the actual culprit was the light weight of the baggage cars, which caused harmonic vibrations when placed directly behind the much heavier SDP40F. A contributing factor was the sometimes poor quality of track the locomotive operated over.\n\nAmtrak took several corrective measures, including operating with a reduced speed on curves, emptying the smaller of the two water tanks in order to reduce lateral motion, and making various alterations to the trucks themselves. The measures helped, but the trouble continued. Several railroads, including the Burlington and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O), banned the \"rail breakers\" from their tracks . For the Chicago–Seattle \"Empire Builder\", the speed restrictions added 6 hours to what had been a 46-hour schedule. Another important development was the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the new HEP-equipped Amfleet I coaches, designed for short runs, into service. The new EMD F40PH, intended for short-distance service and equipped with HEP, handled these trains.\n\nIn the spring of 1977 Amtrak faced a power crisis. In addition to the SDP40Fs derailing, Amtrak was having trouble with two other six-axle designs. The GE E60CP and E60CH electric locomotives were having derailment problems as well; the GE P30CH had the same truck design as E60s and rode poorly, although it did not exhibit the same tendency to derail. Amtrak decided to abandon the SDP40F in favor of the F40PH, a four-axle design with none of the riding problems of the six-axle locomotives. Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. Between 1977–1987 Amtrak would trade 132 of the SDP40Fs back to EMD for F40PHRs. The SDP40F remained in service on the Santa Fe longer than anywhere else, although the arrival of HEP-equipped Superliner cars on the Western routes displaced them from there as well. The last SDP40Fs left the Amtrak roster in 1987, the remaining Amtrak SDP40F's that weren't sold to the ATSF (seen below) are presumed to have been scrapped.\n\nIn 1984 Amtrak, low on light-duty power, traded 18 SDP40Fs to the Santa Fe for 43 switchers: 25 CF7s and 18 SSB1200s. Santa Fe rebuilt the traded locomotives for freight use. Modifications included removing the steam generators and regearing for lower speed. The locomotives were also given front steps and platforms, and notched noses in order to improve boarding access. The rebuilt locomotives were designated SDF40-2. The SDF40-2s continued in service with the BNSF Railway, successor to the Santa Fe, until their retirement in 2002.\n\nOne SDF40-2, ex-Amtrak No. 644, was acquired by Dynamic Rail Preservation Inc. and is in Boulder City, Nevada having been previously displayed in Ogden, Utah. It has been renumbered to its BNSF-era 6976 number and returned to operation in November 2019.\n\n"}

Katzin. It features actual footage captured during the 1970 race held the previous June.\n\nTop flight Le Mans racing driver Michael Delaney (Steve McQueen) spots former rival Piero Belgetti's widow Lisa (Elga Andersen) buying flowers in the days before the race; he then drives to the scene of the accident which killed her husband the previous year. He has a flashback of Belgetti losing control of his Ferrari, forcing him to crash as well.\n\nLike many others, Lisa appears to feel Delaney was responsible, at least in part, for the accident. At the race she is understandably downcast while working through her emotions. In an awkward scene, Delaney looks for a place to sit in a near empty track commissary, only to ask Lisa if he may join her. There is obvious tension between them, but also respect and a hint of mutual attraction.\n\nAfter 13 hours of racing, Erich Stahler (Siegfried Rauch) spins his Ferrari 512 at Indianapolis Corner, causing teammate Claude Aurac (Luc Merenda) to veer off the track in a major accident. Momentarily distracted by the flames of Aurac's car, Delaney reacts too late to safely avoid a slower car, striking the guardrail and then bouncing several times across the road, striking the guardrails on each side of the road multiple times, totaling his Porsche 917. Both survive, but Aurac's injuries are extensive and he is medevaced to a hospital by helicopter. Lisa appears at the track clinic where Delaney is briefly treated. She is distraught at his crash, which stirs up emotions from Piero's passing she had been seeking to put in the past. Delaney consoles her and rescues her from a horde of reporters. After he puts her in a waiting car, a journalist asks Delaney whether his and Aurac's accident can be compared to the one with Belgetti in the previous year's race. Delaney merely stares him down.\n\nPorsche driver Johann Ritter senses that his wife, Anna, would like for him to quit racing. He suggests it, thinking she will be overjoyed. She demurs and says she would like it only if he likes it. He chides her a bit about not being entirely honest. Later the decision is taken out of his hands when team manager David Townsend (Ronald Leigh-Hunt) replaces him for not being quick enough on the track. Anna tries to comfort him, reminding him that he was planning to quit anyway.\n\nLisa goes to Delaney's trailer to talk with him. After his brush with death she is even more drawn to him and despairs that he may meet the same fate as her husband, but Delaney finds the thrill too addictive to quit. Townsend enters and asks him to take over driving Ritter's car. After a moment's unspoken communion with Lisa, he follows Townsend who tells him \"Michael, I want you to drive flat out. I want Porsche to win Le Mans.\"\n\nIn the closing minutes of the race the two Porsches and their rival Ferraris vie for the win, with Delaney in the #21 car and teammate Larry Wilson in #22. The Ferrari leading the race retires due to a flat tire, leaving Wilson in the lead and only Delaney's archrival, Stahler, to contend with. The faster pair quickly catches Wilson. Delaney passes Stahler for second place.\n\nSlower traffic in his lane forces Delaney to brake, allowing Stahler to overtake on the left. Delaney drafts the German, then both move alongside Wilson. Delaney then takes actions that seem intended to guarantee a 1–2 Porsche win rather than going for first himself. Rather than try to pass Wilson, then possibly Stahler, Delaney switches to the right lane and drafts Wilson allowing both to pull up with Stahler. Then for good measure he bumps Stahler twice. When Stahler tries to pass again Delaney steers toward him, looking likely to bump Stahler again and send him into the guard rail, forcing him to throttle back and brake to avoid that outcome thus ensuring the desired 1–2 win for Porsche.\n\n\n\"Le Mans\" was filmed on location on the Le Mans circuit between June and November 1970, including during that season's actual 24 Hours of Le Mans race in mid-June. McQueen had intended to race a Porsche 917 together with Jackie Stewart, but the #26 entry was not accepted. Instead, he is depicted as starting the race in the blue #20 Gulf-Porsche 917K driven by Jo Siffert and Brian Redman. The race-leading white #25 Porsche 917 \"Long tail\" was piloted by Vic Elford and Kurt Ahrens, Jr..\n\nThe Porsche 908/2 which McQueen had previously co-driven to a second place in the 12 Hours of Sebring was entered in the race by McQueen's \"Solar Productions\", complete with heavy movie cameras capturing actual racing footage. This #29 camera car, which can be briefly seen in the starting grid covered with a black sheet (at approximately 17:51) and again at just before the 79 minute-mark (at 1:18:42) racing past the starting line, was driven by Porsche's Herbert Linge and Jonathan Williams. It travelled 282 laps, or and finished the race in 9th position, but it was not classified as it had not covered the required minimum distance due to the stops to change film reels. It did, however, manage to finish 2nd in the P3.0 class.\n\nAdditional footage shot after the race used actual Porsche 917 and Ferrari 512s, in competition liveries. In the crash scenes comparatively expendable technologically obsolete Lola T70 chassis were fitted with replica Porsche and Ferrari bodywork.\n\nThough depicted as the factory-backed Scuderia Ferrari team, the 512's used were borrowed from Belgian Ferrari distributor Jacques Swaters after Enzo Ferrari balked at supplying cars due to the script's Porsche team victory.\n\nMcQueen had wanted to employ Christopher Chapman's new multi-dynamic image technique in the film, as had been done at his instigation with \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", in which he starred in 1968. Chapman advised against it, much to McQueen's disappointment; in Chapman's words, \"it was much too big a film, with too many writers; it wouldn't work that way.\"\n\nSteve McQueen and Director John Sturges long worked on the project and originally had the film set up at Warner Bros. as \"Day of the Champion\". But with Warner Bros selling the studio to Kinney National Services, Inc., McQueen's multi picture deal with the studio was cancelled. After securing a deal with Cinema Center Films and National General Pictures the project was reborn \"Le Mans\". After a troubled pre-production and partial production Sturges quit the film and the studio took over the project. Lee H. Katzin was brought in to finish the project.\n\n\"\" is a 2015 documentary film, detailing the actor's quest to make the 1971 film \"Le Mans\".\n\n\n"}

Each year's main-stage line-up can include bluegrass, old-time, Cajun, Celtic, acoustic blues, Gospel, etc. The line-up includes national, regional and local performers, and singer/songwriters are always featured. The Festival also includes music and activities designed for teens and children. An arts and craft show sponsored by a local art organization is held in conjunction with the Festival. Many of the art and craft vendors sell earth-friendly items. The Hiawatha Festival began in 1979 in Champion, Michigan. Since 1984, the Festival has been held at the Marquette Tourist Park, a park owned by the City of Marquette. Camping is available on-site for Festival-goers. The Hiawatha Music Festival is conducted by the Hiawatha Music Non Profit Corporation, 501(c)3 non-profit commonly known as the Hiawatha Music Co-op.\n\nThe Hiawatha Music Festival is located in Tourist Park, a campground along the Dead River. It is a great location for the festival and more than accommodates all campers to bathrooms with showers, a green field for activities, and a lake with a beach. \n\nThe music festival requires a year-round effort of many volunteers to keep it going. This group still includes several of the original founders. \n\nEach year's Festival includes a variety of licensed, contracted food concessionaires, as well as a juried arts and crafts show coordinated by Marquette's Oasis Gallery in conjunction with the Festival. There is a token system much like most festivals that people can purchase in the same area as the vendors. Musicians also use this vendor area to promote or sell their CDs and DVDs. In addition, there are activities and performances for young children, tweens and teenagers. Workshops for adults run all day on Saturday and Sunday. \n\nCamping in the park is a very great experience during the festival. There are quiet sections for families, a section for youths to commune and camp, and the rising favorite 'A' section where the musicians normally stay. Even after midnight when the main stage has seen its last act, the musicians and bands will mix and congregate to play music all throughout the night. This is a great way for amateurs to even step in and show what they've got. Fire pits are available for warmth and light and are usable from start to end.\n\nHiawatha and local authorities work to keep the festival a safe for all with a combination of experienced security volunteers, paid security and City officers. \n\n"}
{"id": "1987167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987167", "title": "Petite Princess Yucie", "text": "Petite Princess Yucie\n\n\"Petite Princess Yucie\" follows the adventures of country-girl Yucie as she is admitted by chance to the prestigious Princess Academy, where the daughters of royalty and nobles attend to learn magic, dance, etiquette, defense, art and music. There, she experiences many things in her quest to collect the \"fragments\" of the Eternal Tiara in hopes that she may become the legendary Platinum Princess, who is chosen every 1,000 years. Yucie, along with the four other Princess candidates who are initially her rivals but are won over by her offer of friendship, must grow in heart—if not in height—to become worthy of the Tiara. Yucie is a spunky heroine who is a genius of smiles, and who, despite her common lifestyle, is actually the daughter of a noble and former hero who has retreated from courtly life and lives in the countryside. She was discovered as a baby when Gunbard, the former Hero found her in the middle of a battle.\n\nThe fragments take the form of Crystal Flowers and are scattered throughout the five worlds; Human, Demon, Heaven, Spirit, and Fairy. Strangely enough, the five candidates Yucie, Glenda, Elmina, Cocoloo and Beth are representatives of these five existing worlds in this story's universe. As the legend goes, once the Eternal Tiara is complete, it will select the Princess from the worthy candidates and can grant her one wish. Unknown to the candidates and the viewers, until almost the very end, is the sad history of the Eternal Tiara and the inevitable fate of the Platinum Princess and all the other candidates.\n\nBlindly pursuing what is her heart's lifelong desire, to finally grow up and be treated and respected like an adult, Yucie must prove her worthiness to the Tiara and sets out to do many odd jobs as part of the Academy's special Curriculum (NOTE: community service) for the candidates, such as tending flowers, babysitting a giant fluff ball, helping to run an old church, helping to run a bakery, and overseeing a kindergarten picnic. Each task seems easy at first but problems abound in every episode. The girls must overcome all obstacles and complete their tasks, no matter how daunting, in their petite bodies. The viewers later discover that all the candidates are under the same 10-year-old \"curse\" and their rivalry quickly turns into admiration for one another's determination in reaching their common goal. Yucie and her friends each have a reason for desperately wanting to become the Platinum Princess.\n\nIn a side-story arc, Yucie is also hoping to find clues about the lost prince of the Human realm, who once saved her life while she was lost in the forest, looking for Sunset Blossoms, and whom she wishes to meet in person some day to thank him. Her memory of him is vague, and he was an adolescent at the time, so she has no idea what he may look like now or what kind of person he's become. When she encounters a young man named Arc during one of her odd jobs who looks so familiar to her, she has conflicted feelings. Arc is rude, patronizing, unfeeling and insensitive but she feels drawn to him somehow. The prince was her childhood romantic ideal, but her seventeen-year-old heart falls for Arc. To the relief of viewers who hate love triangles, Arc is actually Prince Arrow in disguise.\n\nAs the girls continue to grow emotionally, their Platinum Princess candidate pendants grow in beauty and brightness as well, reflecting how much wisdom they have obtained. Towards the final story arc, Yucie and the others finally realize why the Fairy World princess was so troubled and uncooperative when Beth reveals that her father, King of the Fairy Realm, is dying. The girls are resolved in helping their friend and saving the Fairy Realm by defeating the ancient evil Diablo who threatens the existence of all the worlds. With the combined help of their stewards and friends, the girls succeed with the power they obtained as candidates, but the prince is badly injured.\n\nThe final story arc begins with the final test in which a magical judge will oversee the Tiara's choice. Yucie's only wish now is to save the prince with the power of the Tiara.\n\nUpon entering the place of judgment, Yucie and her friends meet a mysterious figure, wrapped in a tattered brown cloak. The judge's identity is hinted at when she uses her magic staff to change all of the candidates' clothing similar to her own. Out of friendship for Yucie, and to support her wish to save Prince Arrow, Glenda, Cocoloo, Elmina, and Beth all renounce their candidacy, making Yucie the only choice. The Tiara accepts Yucie as its new master. However, in one final twist, the girls realize that those not chosen by the Tiara will simply vanish. Yucie refuses to accept the Tiara when she learns this, and tells the others she is determined to save the Prince some other way, as she cannot sacrifice her friends in the process.\n\nAfter careful thought, Glenda, Cocoloo, Elmina, and Beth ask the judge to erase Yucie's memories of them, so that she can return to the Human Realm in time to save the prince. In a tearful final goodbye, Glenda, perhaps Yucie's strongest rival, tells her to never forget to be her cheerful self. After Yucie leaves, the remaining four sketch a portrait of themselves and Yucie on a stone slab, in remembrance of their friendship, and disappear.\n\nYucie returns to save Prince Arrow and collapses from exhaustion. The Eternal Tiara disappears after its owner makes her wish, its immense power quelled by Yucie's strength of heart, and history repeats itself. Yucie awakens to the keen sense that she has lost something of great importance to her, but cannot remember what. Her father, Gunbard, feels responsible for her misery, since he was the one who put the Tiara together and restarted the Legend in their lifetime. With the help of the fathers of the missing girls, he opens the gateway to the place of judgment so Yucie and Prince Arrow can retrieve what was lost.\n\nYucie faces the cloaked figure once more and demands that what was lost be returned. The viewers discover that the ruined empty world that was the place of judgment is actually the lost Magic World, a sixth realm in this story's universe. The judge was actually a Platinum Princess Candidate 1,000 years ago, a princess of the Magic Realm, who refused the Tiara to save her friends, but lost her friends and her world to destruction as a result.\n\nYucie stumbles across Cocoloo's drawing, which breaks the judge's spell and unlocks all of her memories. The princess of the Magic Realm chides Yucie for not accepting her fate, but Yucie tells her how important friends are, as they are her true strength, and recalls all the great moments she had with each of them. With her power as the Platinum Princess, her tears shine brightly on the ground, causing a miracle.\n\nAll the spirits of the Magic Realm rush to Yucie, who can now hear them. She tells the princess of the Magic Realm that all who died there still love her, and that they have always been with her these 1,000 years, and they never regretted fighting alongside her to the very end. The judge realizes that she had never been alone and that she had made the right choice in trying to save her friends. Yucie's power covers the ground with Sunset Blossoms, and a Crystal Flower emerges from the ground to the hands of the Princess of the Magic Realm. The 6th and final fragment is added to the Eternal Tiara. Together, the former and present Plantinum Princess combine their strength to make Yucie's wish come true. The Magic Realm finally collapses after its last princess, smiling with joy, disappears.\n\nIn the end, Yucie and her fellow former candidates are readmitted into the Academy for further study. With the curse lifted, and the Eternal Tiara again fragmented and sealed, they can finally grow up normally and enjoy their mutual friendship at their own pace.\n\n\n\n\n\nTakami Akai, the character designer for the \"Princess Maker\" series of games (also by Gainax), was the character designer and original creator for \"Yucie\". Thus, there are many similarities between characters in the \"Princess Maker\" games and this series. Of note, Yucie's appearance is based on Lisa, the daughter from \"Princess Maker 3\"; the judge in the final episode has the same appearance as Maria, the daughter from \"Princess Maker 1\"; and the young Queen Ercell has the same appearance as Olive, the daughter from \"Princess Maker 2\".\n\nIn addition, 'Cube' is the player's butler in \"Princess Maker 2\", \"Princess Maker 4\", and \"Princess Maker 5\". In the anime, Cube is also Yucie's butler and has a nearly identical design.\n\nAround episode 14, the ending imagery begins showing images of all five girls instead of images of just Yucie, and while the ending theme title doesn't change, the wording does change slightly. This reverts briefly for episode 19 with the ending imagery returning to what it was before, while the wording remains slightly changed.\n\n"}

They raided small cargo ships in the North River of New York Harbor during the post-Civil War period of the 1860s. After a time the ocean liners and major shipping vessels around the Manhattan west side dockyards became so well protected that the gang moved upriver. \n\nIn 1869, under the leadership of Sadie the Goat, the gang stole a sloop, and soon began raiding merchant ships and homes along the Hudson River, from the Harlem River as far as Poughkeepsie and Albany, New York. Flying the flag of the Jolly Roger, the gang was extremely successful. They became known for kidnapping wealthy men, women and children for ransom. According to newspapers of the period, Sadie the Goat allegedly had forced several male victims to walk the plank. However, after several victims had been murdered by the gang, local Hudson Valley residents formed a vigilante group. After a number of Charlton Street gang members were killed in a series of violent battles, the gang decided to retreat to the New York waterfront, where they returned to street crime.

Pollmar in 1900 and the Lenox Hotel by A.C. Varney in 1903. A two-story building between the two hotels later connected the pair, creating the Madison-Lenox Hotel. The buildings were last occupied during the 1990s. The hotels stood at the south-west corner of Madison Street and East Grand River Avenue, across the street from the Detroit Athletic Club.\n\nIn 1985, theater actor Council Cargle and his wife, Maggie Porter, founded the 40-seat Harmonie Park Playhouse in the basement of the Madison-Lenox Hotel. The basement theater, which had previously been utilized as a barbershop and artist studio, was used for off-Broadway productions until the theater's closure in 1990.\n\nIn 2004 a group led by sport team owner Mike Ilitch submitted requests for the building's demolition to Detroit's Historic District Commission (HDC). These requests were quickly denied and the building stood. Despite offers by developers interested in the building, Ilitch declined to sell the property, preferring to demolish the structures to create a parking lot. Both the City of Detroit and Ilitch were hoping to get the building demolished and the land cleared before Detroit hosted Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006.\n\nIn 2004, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added the building to its annual list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. \n\nThe May 2005 demolition by Adamo Group was the subject of significant controversy. Though demolition permits had been denied the city government pressed for the building's destruction nevertheless, stating that the structure was in danger of collapse. Preservation groups fought the demolition with a restraining order a few hours after work commenced, but later that day a judge allowed the demolition to continue. Even though the HDC had originally denied demolition permits they did not oppose the move. The whole structure was gone within a week.\n\nThe building was the second on the \"11 Most Endangered Historic Places\" to be demolished.\n\nThe property is still held by Ilitch Holdings and is currently used as a parking lot. The gated parking area is serviced by Olympia Entertainment and chiefly serves Comerica Park.\n"}

{"id": "1987177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987177", "title": "Pouteria campechiana", "text": "Pouteria campechiana\n\nPouteria campechiana (commonly known as the canistel) is an evergreen tree native to, and cultivated in, southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. It is cultivated in other countries, such as Costa Rica, Brazil, the United States, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and the Philippines. The edible part of the tree is its fruit, which is colloquially known as an egg fruit.\n\nThe canistel grows up to high, and produces orange-yellow fruit, also called yellow sapote, up to long, which are edible raw. Canistel flesh is sweet, with a texture often compared to that of a hard-boiled egg yolk, hence its colloquial name \"eggfruit\". It is closely related to the lucuma, mamey sapote, and abiu.\n\nThe shape and size of the fruit is highly variable, depending on the cultivar. The better selections consistently produce large, ovate fruit with glossy skin weighing upwards of 400 g (14 oz). The flesh is somewhat pasty, although the best varieties have a creamy, mousse-like texture. The flavor is rich and is reminiscent of an egg custard. The fruit may contain one to six large, brown seeds.\n\nThe canistel displays climacteric fruit ripening. A fully mature fruit shows an intense yellow skin color. It eventually softens and drops from the tree. Insects and birds avoid the fruit flesh, perhaps because of its astringent properties, that are much reduced in senescent fruits, but still perceptible to the human palate. Apparently mature fruits severed from the tree while still hard often fail to develop the desired climacteric changes in terms of reduced astringency and a texture reminiscent of egg yolk.\n\nLike the related lucuma, the canistel can be eaten fresh, and has the texture of a hard-boiled egg yolk. The ripe fruit can be made into jam, marmalade, pancakes, and flour. The ripe flesh is blended with milk and other ingredients to make a shake, and pureed, it is sometimes added to custards or used in making ice cream. It is also used in a milkshake known as \"eggfruit nog\".\n\nThe wood of the tree is occasionally used in construction where it is available, especially as planks or rafters. In its native range, it has been a source of latex used to adulterate chicle.\n\nIts specific name is derived from the Mexican town of Campeche, where it is native.\n\nIn the numerous countries where it is cultivated or sold, it is known by many vernacular names; canistel is common, as are variations on egg fruit and names referring to its yellow color. In the Philippines, it is called \"chesa\", \"tiessa\", or \"tiesa\". In Sri Lanka, this fruit is known as \"laulu\", \"lavulu\", or \"lawalu\". In Thailand, it is known by different traditional popular names such as \"lamut Khamen\" (ละมุดเขมร=\"Khmer sapodilla\") or \"tho Khamen\" (ท้อเขมร=\"Khmer peach\"), folk imagination attributing a hypothetical Cambodian origin to this fruit (the name of the fruit is \"see da\" in Cambodia). Currently, those names are discouraged by linguistic authorities and names making no reference to Cambodia, such as \"mon khai\" (ม่อนไข่) —\"Khai\" meaning \"egg\", or \"tiesa\" (ทิสซา), are officially favored.\n\nThe plant's name in the Vietnamese language is \"cây trứng gà\" (\"chicken egg\" plant) because of the fruit's appearance.\n\nIn Indonesian language, it is called \"alkesah\", or \"sawo mentega\" (butter sapodilla, for its color and texture).\n\nThough relatively rare in East Africa, they can be found, and in the Swahili language, the fruit is confusingly named \"zaituni\", which is the same word used to refer to olives.\n\nIn Taiwan, it is called \"danhuang guo\" (蛋黃果), \"egg yolk fruit\" or \"xiantao\" (仙桃) \"peach of the immortals\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1987192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987192", "title": "M-72 (Michigan highway)", "text": "M-72 (Michigan highway)\n\nM-72 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan, running from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan across the northern part of the Lower Peninsula. The highway connects M-22 in Empire with US Highway 23 (US 23) in Harrisville. It is one of only three Michigan state trunklines that cross the Lower Peninsula, shore to shore. In between, M-72 runs across Northern Michigan woodland, agricultural areas of the Leelanau Peninsula near Traverse City, and the Au Sable River watershed. The trunkline also provides access to Camp Grayling, a National Guard training facility near the city of the same name. Traffic levels along the highway vary from approximately 800 vehicles a day on the east end to over 32,000 vehicles near Traverse City.\n\nM-72 was first designated as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. One section of the modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected from the rest of M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.\n\nM-72 starts its trans-peninsular journey at M-22 in the community of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula. As the highway approaches the city of Traverse City, the roadway runs downhill and weaves back and forth across the Leelanau – Grand Traverse county line. M-72 merges with M-22 to run concurrently in the section of Traverse City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand Traverse County. The two highways run along Grandview Parkway, a four-lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street, M-22 ends. US 31/M-37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M-72. These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay, bypassing downtown. They then follow Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown. At Garfield, M-37 turns north to run up the Old Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand Traverse Bay. US 31/M-72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay and northward to a junction in Acme. M-72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand Traverse County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek.\n\nThe highway crosses into Kalkaska County at Barker Creek and continues eastward to Kalkaska. There, M-72 meets US 131/M-66 (Cedar Street) on the north side of downtown, and M-72 turns south along Cedar Street and forms another triple concurrency through downtown. South of town, the highway crosses the Boardman River again, and M-72 turns east again headed toward the city of Grayling. M-66 follows M-72 to cross a set of railroad tracks that belong to the Great Lakes Central Railroad before leaving to follow its path to Lake City. M-72 crosses the Manistee River at the Kalkaska–Crawford county line and passes the northern shore of Lake Margrethe west of town in the Camp Grayling military reservation. North of the camp gate, M-72 joins M-93 into downtown Grayling. Together they meet James Street, which carries Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). M-93 turns north to follow BL I-75 out of town, and M-72 turns south to follow it through downtown. At South Down River Road, M-72 turns east again to leave Grayling, crossing I-75 in the process. There is no direct access to I-75 from M-72. Instead traffic is directed to follow BL I-75 in either direction to get to the freeway.\n\nIn eastern Crawford County, M-72 runs through the Au Sable State Forest and crosses the South Branch of the Au Sable River on the Wakeley Bridge. East of the river crossing, the trunkline intersects the northern terminus of M-18 before crossing into Oscoda County. M-72 continues east through Luzerne to Mio. M-72 merges with M-33 and turns north to cross the Au Sable River a second time in Mio. The highways pick up a concurrency with F-32 north of the river. The three roadways run together until F-32 turns west while M-33/M-72 continues east to Fairview. Fairview marks the northern and eastern end of the concurrency as M-33 turns north towards Atlanta, and M-72 continues easterly into Alcona County. North of Curran, M-72 merges southward with M-65 for approximately before heading due east through the Barton City and Lincoln areas to Harrisville. M-72 ends at an intersection with US 23 in Harrisville, on the shores of Lake Huron.\n\nM-72 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system. As a part of its maintenance duties, the department tracks the traffic volumes along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, the MDOT surveys found that the highest traffic levels along M-72 were the 33,720 vehicles per day in Traverse City. The lowest AADT was 807 vehicles near Hubbard Lake Road in Alcona County near Lincoln. Commercial traffic varied between the 555 trucks a day in Graylling and the 72 trucks daily west of Harrisville. M-72 has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) between the intersection of Division Street and Grandview Parkway in Traverse City and the southern junction with BL I-75 in Grayling. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, mobility and economy. In addition to the NHS listing, M-72 has been included on the Lake Michigan Circle Tour along its segments concurrent with M-22 and US 31 in the Traverse City area.\n\nM-72 was first designated by July 1, 1919, and it ran from the middle of Alcona County near Barton City east to Harrisville and then south along Lake Huron shore to Greenbush. Around 1927, the route was extended south to Oscoda and west through Luzerne to just east of Roscommon. The section of M-72 along the shoreline between Oscoda and Harrisville became part of US 23. in 1936. M-72 was extended westward on an earthen highway and then over the former M-208 to Grayling in 1940. From there M-72 was extended further to just south of Kalkaska along a section of highway previously designated M-76. A seven-mile (11 km) long discontinuous segment of highway some west of Kalkaska near Empire was also redesignated as part of M-72. The section of highway south to Roscommon became M-144. By 1945, the western segment was extended east into Traverse City. The two segments were joined when M-72 was routed along US 31 through Traverse City to Acme by early 1948. From there, M-72 was routed along existing roads through Williamsburg to US 131/M-66 north of Kalkaska where it followed the latter highways through downtown to bridge the gap. With this addition to the routing, the road extended \"shore to shore\" from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan.\n\nThe Michigan State Highway Department rerouted M-33/M-72 near Fairview in late 1951 or early 1952, turning the former route back to local control. In the middle of 1953, the section of M-65/M-72 in Alcona County was straightened and paved. All but the western three miles (4.8 km) of the earthen highway section opened in 1940 were paved in 1957. By the middle of 1961, the highway would be paved in its entirety. A new section of highway was opened in 1973, rerouting M-66 and M-72 due west from their junction to US 131, bypassing a former routing north into Kalkaska.\n\nIn 2008, M-72 within Alcona County was named the \"Hazen Shirley 'Kiki' Cuyler Memorial Highway\" in honor of the Michigan native and Hall of Fame baseball player.\n\nM-208 was a state trunkline highway in that served as a spur route from US 27 (current BL I-75) to the \"Wakeley Bridge\" in Crawford County in the 1930s. The highway was designated by 1936, and it was removed from the highway system in 1939. By the end of 1940, the roadway was redesignated as a part of the state highway system when M-72 was extended to the bridge from the east and then over the former M-208 to Grayling. The roadway has remained a state highway since.\n\n"}

Most notably, Brandon Carter showed in 1968 that the magnetic moment of such an object would match that of an electron. This is interesting because calculations ignoring special relativity and treating the electron as a small rotating sphere of charge give a magnetic moment that is off by roughly a factor of 2, the so-called gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nHowever, Carter's calculations also show that a would-be black hole with these parameters would be 'super-extremal'. Thus, unlike a true black hole, this object would display a naked singularity, meaning a singularity in spacetime not hidden behind an event horizon. It would also give rise to closed timelike curves.\n\nStandard quantum electrodynamics (QED), currently the most comprehensive theory of particles, treats the electron as a point particle. There is no evidence that the electron is a black hole (or naked singularity). Furthermore, since the electron is quantum mechanical in nature, any description purely in terms of general relativity is inadequate. Hence, the existence of a black hole electron remains strictly hypothetical.\n\nA paper published in 1938 by Albert Einstein, Leopold Infeld and Banesh Hoffmann showed that if elementary particles are treated as singularities in spacetime, it is unnecessary to postulate geodesic motion as part of general relativity. The electron may be treated as such a singularity.\n\nIf one ignores the electron's angular momentum and charge, as well as the effects of quantum mechanics, one can treat the electron as a black hole and attempt to compute its radius. The Schwarzschild radius of a mass is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating, uncharged black hole of that mass. It is given by\n\nwhere is Newton's gravitational constant and is the speed of light. For the electron,\n\nso\n\nThus, if we ignore the electric charge and angular momentum of the electron, and naively apply general relativity on this very small length scale without taking quantum theory into account, a black hole of the electron's mass would have this radius.\n\nIn reality, physicists expect quantum gravity effects to become significant even at much larger length scales, comparable to the Planck length\n\nSo, the above purely classical calculation cannot be trusted. Furthermore, even classically, electric charge and angular momentum affect the properties of a black hole. To take them into account, while still ignoring quantum effects, one should use the Kerr–Newman metric. If we do, we find the angular momentum and charge of the electron are too large for a black hole of the electron's mass: a Kerr-Newman object with such a large angular momentum and charge would instead be 'super-extremal', displaying a naked singularity, meaning a singularity not shielded by an event horizon.\n\nTo see that this is so, it suffices to consider the electron's charge and neglect its angular momentum. In the Reissner–Nordström metric, which describes electrically charged but non-rotating black holes, there is a quantity , defined by\n\nwhere is the electron's charge and is the vacuum permittivity. For an electron with = − = , this gives a value\n\nSince this (vastly) exceeds the Schwarzschild radius, the Reissner–Nordström metric has a naked singularity.\n\nIf we include the effects of the electron's rotation using the Kerr-Newman metric, there is still a naked singularity, which is now a ring singularity, and spacetime also has closed timelike curves. The size of this ring singularity is on the order of\n\nwhere as before is the electron's mass and is the speed of light, but = formula_1 is the spin angular momentum of the electron. This gives\n\nwhich is much larger than the length scale associated to the electron's charge. As noted by Carter, this length is on the order of the electron's Compton wavelength. Unlike the Compton wavelength, it is not quantum-mechanical in nature.\n\nMore recently, Alexander Burinskii has pursued the idea of treating the electron as a Kerr–Newman naked singularity.\n\n\n"}

The Sydney suburb of was named in his honour.\n\nPiper was born in Maybole, Ayrshire Scotland, son of Hugh Piper, a doctor; his family came from Cornwall.\n\nHe was commissioned as an ensign in the New South Wales Corps in 1791, and sailed on the convict ship \"Pitt\", arriving in Sydney in February 1792. In 1793 he was sent, at his own request, to the convict settlement of Norfolk Island, perhaps because of a scandalous love affair. There was certainly an illegitimate daughter born around this time.\n\nPiper was promoted lieutenant and returned to Sydney in 1795; from 1797 to 1799 he was on leave. In 1800 Piper was promoted to the local rank of captain. Piper supported John Macarthur in the struggle between the New South Wales Corps and Governor King, and acted as his second in a duel with Colonel Paterson, his commanding officer. Piper was arrested and court-martialled in 1802, but apologised and was acquitted, to King's disgust.\n\nPiper returned to Norfolk Island in 1804 and, when Lieutenant-Governor Joseph Foveaux left on prolonged sick leave, became acting commandant. His rule was mild, one of the convicts later writing that he \"had the good will and respect of everyone, for he had always conducted himself as a Christian and a gentleman.\" He was promoted to the full rank of captain in 1806. During Piper's period of leadership on Norfolk Island the British government decided it was too costly to maintain, and planned to close the settlement and transfer the inhabitants to Sydney or Van Diemen's Land. Piper showed both tact and organising ability in arranging for the transfers, especially of those settlers who had built up farms and families on the island.\n\nPiper returned to Sydney in 1810, having avoided all the turmoil of the Rum Rebellion. He sailed for England in 1811, but resigned his commission and returned to Sydney in February 1814, as Naval Officer.\n\nIn 1816 he married Mary Ann Shears, the daughter of two First Fleet convicts, who had already borne several children by him.\n\nAs Naval Officer, Piper was responsible for the collection of customs duties, excise on spirits, harbour dues, control of lighthouses, and crime on water. This post proved very remunerative, and he was able to purchase the property now known as Vaucluse House. He was granted on what is now Point Piper and built Henrietta Pavilion at the large cost of £10,000. He was appointed a magistrate by Governor Macquarie in 1819, was chairman of directors of the Bank of New South Wales, sat on the local committee of the Australian Agricultural Co., was president of the Scots Church committee, and was involved in many social and sporting activities. As well as Point Piper he had at Vaucluse, at Woollahra and Rose Bay, a farm of at Petersham, at Neutral Bay, at Botany Bay, at Bathurst, in Van Diemen's Land, and an of commercial land in George Street, Sydney.\n\nPiper however, had financial difficulties; in 1826 he raised a mortgage of £20,000. He was forced to resign his bank chairmanship after an enquiry into its affairs in January 1827, and that April was suspended from his position as Naval Officer when mismanagement of customs collection was discovered. Piper unsuccessfully tried to drown himself, and was forced to sell most of his property to repay his debts in full. Piper retired to his farm at Bathurst and became an important person in the town, but was forced to mortgage the property in the drought of 1838. Piper was saved by his friends who re-established the family to a property beside the Macquarie River. Here Piper died on 8 June 1851, and Mary Ann continued to live until her death twenty years later, supported by her numerous children.\n\nMarjorie Barnard claims that \"John Piper was a man of his times. He personified the colonial dream.\" He was an officer during the military rule, a civil servant when New South Wales became a civil state, and a land pioneer during the pastoral age. \"He was honourable, generous, gay and so well loved that he was forgiven things which would have wrecked a stronger man. … He was a master of the bright illusion.\"\n"}

{"id": "1987226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987226", "title": "Templers (religious believers)", "text": "Templers (religious believers)\n\nThe Temple Society () is a German Protestant sect with roots in the Pietist movement of the Lutheran Church. Members refer to themselves as Templers.\n\nThe Templers were expelled from the Lutheran Church in 1858 because of their millenarian beliefs. Their aim was to realize the apocalyptic visions of the prophets of Israel in the Holy Land.\n\nThe word \"Templer\" is derived from the concept of the Christian Community as described in the New Testament, see 1 Corinthians and 1 Peter , where every person and the community are seen as temples in which God's spirit dwells. There is no connection to the Medieval Knights Templar.\n\nChristoph Hoffmann and Georg David Hardegg (1812–1879) founded the Temple Society at Kirschenhardthof near Ludwigsburg in 1861. This religious society has its roots in the Pietist movement within the Lutheran Evangelical State Church in Württemberg. Called \"Deutscher Tempel\" by its founders, their aim was to promote spiritual cooperation to advance the rebuilding of the Temple in the Holy Land, Palestine, in the belief that this foundation will promote the second coming of Christ.\n\nWhile the Lutheran state church in Württemberg condemned and fought the Templers as apostates, the Prussian Protestant position was somewhat milder. Their settlement in the Holy Land found a warm support through Wilhelm Hoffmann (1806–1873), who was no apostate from the official church, like his younger brother Christoph.\n\nWilhelm Hoffmann served as one of the royal Prussian court preachers at the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church in Berlin and was a co-founder and first president of the Jerusalem Association (), a charitable organisation founded on 2 December 1852 to support Samuel Gobat's effort as bishop of the Anglo-Prussian Bishopric of Jerusalem.\n\nChristoph Hoffmann fell out with his fellow leader Hardegg, so that in June 1874 the Temple denomination underwent a schism with Hardegg and about a third of the Templers seceding from the Temple Society. The schismatics around Hardegg searched to join another Christian denomination. To this end they addressed the Lutheran Church of Sweden (1874) and the Anglican Church Missionary Society (1879), but both refused to take care of the schismatics.\n\nIn 1878 Hardegg and most of the schismatics founded the \"Temple Association\" (Tempelverein), but after Hardegg's death in the following year the cohesion of its adherents faded. Then envoys of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces successfully proselytised among the schismatics, gaining most of them. Thus some colonies became places of partisans of two different Christian denominations and their respective congregations (Haifa, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Sarona).\n\nWhile in Germany the Templers were regarded sectarians, the Evangelical proselytes gained major financial and intellectual support from German Lutheran and united church bodies. This created an atmosphere of mistrust and envy among the colonists of different denominational affiliation.\n\nHoffmann and Hardegg purchased land at the foot of Mount Carmel and established a colony there in 1868. At the time, Haifa had a population of 4,000. The Templers are credited today with promoting the development of the city. The colonists built an attractive main street that was much admired by the locals. It was 30 meters wide and planted with trees on both sides. The houses, designed by architect Jacob Schumacher, were built of stone, with red-shingled roofs, instead of the flat or domed roofs common in the region. Hard work, the harsh climate and epidemics claimed the lives of many before the colony became self-sustaining. Hardegg stayed in Haifa, while Hoffmann moved on to establish other colonies.\n\nIn the same year, Bahá'u'lláh, the prophet-founder of the Baha’i Faith, arrived in the Haifa-Akka region as a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. Years later, after his release from strict confinement, he visited the Templer Colony on Mount Carmel several times and wrote a letter to Hardegg. He asked his son, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, to build, on the alignment of the Templer Colony road (Carmel Avenue) but halfway up the mountain, the shrine to the forerunner of the religion (who was known as \"the Bab\"). The conjunction of the Templer buildings and the Shrine have become the most significant landmark in the modern city of Haifa.\n\nHoffman established colonies in Jaffa a year later, and two years later, in 1871, a third colony in Sarona, as the Templers' first agricultural colony, on the road from Jaffa to Nablus. In 1873 a fourth colony was established in the Valley of Refaim Jerusalem.\n\nThe colony's oranges were the first to carry a \"Jaffa orange\" brand, one of the better known agricultural brands in Europe, used to market Israeli oranges to this day.\n\nThe Templers established a regular coach service between Haifa and the other cities, promoting the country's tourist industry, and made an important contribution to road construction.\n\nAfter the 1898 visit of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, one of the Kaiser's traveling companions, Colonel Joseph Freiherr von Ellrichshausen, initiated the formation of a society for the advancement of the German settlements in Palestine, in Stuttgart. It enabled the settlers to acquire land for new settlements by offering them low interest loans.\n\nA second wave of pioneer settlers founded Wilhelma (now Bnei Atarot) in 1902 near Lod, Walhalla (1903) near the original Jaffa colony, followed by Bethlehem of Galilee (1906) and Waldheim (now Alonei Abba) in 1907. At its height, the Templer community in Palestine numbered 2,000.\n\nIn July and August 1918 the British sent 850 Templers to an internment camp at Helwan near Cairo in Egypt. In April 1920, 350 of these internees were deported to Germany. All the property of the Templers of enemy nationality (thus except of that of a few US citizens among them) was taken into public custodianship. With the establishment of a regular British administration in 1918 Edward Keith-Roach became the \"Public Custodian of Enemy Property in Palestine\", who rented out the property and collected the rents.\n\nIn April 1920 the Allies convened at the Conference of San Remo and agreed on the British rule in Palestine, followed by the official establishment of the civil administration on 1 July 1920. From that date on Keith-Roach transferred the collected rents for property in custodianship to the actual proprietors. On June 29, 1920, the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, informed the British Upper House that Great Britain agreed in principle to their return to Palestine.\n\nThe League of Nations legitimised the British administration and custodianship by granting a mandate to Britain in 1922, which Turkey, the Ottoman successor, finally ratified by the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on 24 July 1923 and becoming effective on 5 August 1925. Thus the public custodianship ended in the same year and the prior holders achieved the fully protected legal position as proprietors.\n\nThe Mandate government and the Public Custodian of Enemy Property paid them 50% restitution for war losses of livestock and other property. The Bank of the Temple Society, formed in 1925 with its head office in Jaffa and branches in Haifa and Jerusalem, became one of the leading credit institutions in Palestine.\n\nAfter the Nazi takeover in Germany the new Reich's government streamlined foreign policy according to Nazi ideals, using financial pressure especially. The Nazi emphasis was on creating the image that Germany and Germanness were equal to Nazism. Thus, all non-Nazi aspects of German culture and identity were discriminated against as un-German. All international schools of German language subsidised or fully financed by government funds were obliged to redraw their educational programmes and to solely employ teachers aligned to the Nazi party. The teachers in Bethlehem were financed by the Reich government, so Nazi teachers also took over there.\n\nIn 1933 Templer functionaries and other Gentile Germans living in Palestine appealed to Paul von Hindenburg and the Foreign Office not to use swastika symbols for German institutions, without success. Some German Gentiles from Palestine pleaded with the Reich government to drop its plan to boycott shops of Jewish Germans on April 1, 1933. Some Templers enlisted in the German Army. By 1938, 17% of the Templers in Palestine were members of the Nazi party. According to historian Yossi Ben-Artzi, \"The members of the younger generation to some extent broke away from naive religious belief, and were more receptive to the Nazi German nationalism. The older ones tried to fight it.\"\n\nAt the start of World War II colonists with German citizenship were rounded up by the British and sent, together with Italian and Hungarian enemy aliens, to internment camps in Waldheim and Bethlehem of Galilee. On July 31, 1941, 661 Templers and other Germans in Palestine were deported to Australia via Egypt, leaving 345 in Palestine.\n\nIn 1939, at the start of World War II, the British authorities declared the Templers enemy nationals, placed them under arrest and deported many of them to Australia. During the war the British government brokered the exchange of about 1,000 Templers for 550 Jews under German control. \"The swap, Bauer stresses, stemmed primarily from British and German interests: Just as the British wanted to get the Germans out, Germany was happy for the chance to rid itself of a few hundred more Jews. There were three exchanges that took place, one in 1941, one in 1942 and the last in 1944. In total only 480 persons, Templers and other Germans living in Palestine were exchanged.\n\nAfter its foundation, the State of Israel—with the fresh memory of the Holocaust—was adamant in not permitting any ethnic Germans, of a community which had expressed pro-Nazi sympathies, to remain in or return to its territory. On 12 March 1946 a team from the Zionist \"Haganah\" assassinated the leader of the community, Gotthilf Wagner. Later four more members of the sect were murdered in order to drive the group from Palestine. The former Templer colonies were re-settled by Jews.\n\nIn 1962 the State of Israel paid DM54 million in compensation to property owners whose assets were nationalized. Sarona was incorporated in Tel Aviv, part of it becoming the compound of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the IDF High Command Headquarters, while the other part housed various civil offices of the Israeli government, using the original German houses. In the early 21st century the civil offices were evacuated and the area extensively renovated, becoming a new focus of Tel Aviv night life.\n\n\n\n\nIn chronological order of their establishment:\n\n\n"}

It is the lead track on their third studio album, \"Urban Hymns\" (1997). It is based on a sample it uses from the Andrew Loog Oldham orchestral cover of the Rolling Stones' song \"The Last Time\", and involved some legal controversy surrounding a plagiarism charge. As a result, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were added to the songwriting credits, and all royalties from the song went to former Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein. In April 2019, Jagger and Richards signed over all their publishing for the song to Richard Ashcroft. The song was released in June 1997 by Hut Recordings as the first single from the album, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart and remaining in the chart for three months.\n\nAcclaimed in music publications, it was named \"Rolling Stone\" and \"NME\" Single of the Year for 1997, and is considered one of the defining songs of the Britpop era. The accompanying music video features lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft walking down a busy London pavement – in Hoxton Street, Hoxton – oblivious to what is going on around and refusing to change his stride or direction throughout. At the 1998 Brit Awards, \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was nominated for Best British Single. The song was released in the US as a single in March 1998 by Virgin Records America, reaching No. 12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and the music video was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Group Video, and Best Alternative Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1999, the song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.\n\nProducer Youth said: \"This was certainly the most successful track I've done. I think Richard had actually cut a version with John Leckie but, by the time I came on board, he didn't want to do the song. I persuaded him to have a go at cutting a version but at first he wasn't really into it. It was only once we'd put strings on it that he started getting excited. Then, towards the end, Richard wanted to chuck all the album away and start again. What was my reaction? Horror. Sheer horror. All I could say was, I really think you should reconsider.\"\n\nThe opening strings are sampled from the 1965 Andrew Oldham Orchestra recording of the Rolling Stones' song \"The Last Time\", arranged and written by David Whitaker. The Rolling Stones' song was itself strongly inspired by \"This May Be the Last Time\" from the Staple Singers. The Verve negotiated rights to use a six-note sample from the recording from the recording's copyright holder Decca Records; however, they did not obtain permission from former Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein, who owned the copyrights to the band's pre-1970 songs, including \"The Last Time\". Although \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" had already been released, Klein refused to grant a licence for the sample. This led to a lawsuit with ABKCO Records, Klein's holding company, which was settled out of court. The Verve relinquished all royalties to Klein, and the songwriting credits were changed to Jagger/Richards, with Ashcroft receiving $1,000 for completely relinquishing rights.\n\nVerve bassist Simon Jones said, \"We were told it was going to be a 50/50 split, and then they saw how well the record was doing. They rung up and said we want 100 percent or take it out of the shops, you don't have much choice.\" Ashcroft sarcastically said, \"This is the best song Jagger and Richards have written in 20 years\", noting it was their biggest UK hit since \"Brown Sugar\".\n\nIn a 1999 interview with \"Q\", asked whether he believed the result was fair, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards said: \"I'm out of whack here, this is serious lawyer shit. If the Verve can write a better song, they can keep the money.\" In 1999, Andrew Oldham sued for royalties after failing to receive the mechanical royalties he claimed he was owed. After receiving his royalties, Oldham joked that he bought \"a pretty presentable watch strap\" compared to the watch Jagger and Richards would get with the money. In an interview with \"Uncut\", he said: \"As for Richard Ashcroft, well, I don't know how an artist can be severely damaged by that experience. Songwriters have learned to call songs their children, and he thinks he wrote something. He didn't. I hope he's got over it. It takes a while.\"\n\nIn May 2019, Ashcroft received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. Ashcroft announced that the dispute was over following negotiations with Klein's son, Jody, and the Rolling Stones' manager Joyce Smith. Ashcroft thanked Jagger and Richards \"for acknowledging me as the writer of a fucking masterpiece!\" He added:\n\nThe music video (directed by Walter A. Stern) is a homage to the single continuous shot docu-fiction music video for Massive Attack's \"Unfinished Sympathy\". It focuses on Ashcroft singing while walking down a busy London pavement, without changing his stride or direction throughout, except for one instance where he is forced to stop for a moving car and a reflection is seen of him standing stationary in the car's tinted window. He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, repeatedly bumping into passers-by (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of the Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance. This then leads into the beginning of the video for \"The Drugs Don't Work\". The music video received heavy rotation on music channels and it was nominated for a number of awards, including three MTV Awards at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.\nAshcroft starts walking from the southeast corner of the intersection of Hoxton and Falkirk Streets in Hoxton in the East End of London, subsequently proceeding north along the east side of Hoxton Street until he reaches Hoxton Gardens. He then crosses to the corner of Purcell Street and walks back the way he came, before being joined by the rest of the band at the corner of Crondall Street, opposite where he started. The British comedy band Fat Les would later release a direct parody for their 1998 song \"Vindaloo\", an alternative anthem for England at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where Paul Kaye takes the role of an Ashcroft look-alike who is mocked by a growing group of passers by as the video progresses. In 2016, \"The Telegraph\" named Hoxton Street in their list of the 54 locations that defined the Britpop era.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, Coldplay invited Ashcroft to perform the song with them in their set. They played it after only one rehearsal in Crystal Palace. Ashcroft was introduced by Chris Martin as \"the best singer in the world\" and he described the song as \"the best song ever written\". On 25 December 2005, a documentary entitled \"Live 8: A Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was aired reliving moments of the day featuring a portion of Ashcroft's performance as the music for the show's opening soundtrack.\n\nRegarded as the band's signature song and one of the defining tracks and music videos of the Britpop era, \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" has been featured in a number of best ever song lists and polls. It was named \"Rolling Stone\" and \"NME\" Single of the Year for 1997. In 1998, BBC Radio 1 listeners voted it the third Best Track Ever. The same year, it was named the third-best single of 1997 by New York City weekly \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll. In a 2005 Channel 4 poll, the music video was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest Pop Videos.\n\nIn 2007, \"NME\" magazine placed the song at number 18 in its list of the \"50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\". In September 2007, a poll of 50 songwriters in \"Q\" magazine placed it in a list of the \"Top 10 Greatest Tracks\". In the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009, the track was voted the 14th best song of all time. Pitchfork Media included the song at number 29 on their \"Top 200 Tracks of the 90s\" list. The publication also included it in its collection of \"The Pitchfork 500\". In 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 9 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". Despite the band having half a dozen hits, the song featured at number one in \"Paste\" magazine's poll of its 25 \"awesome one-hit wonders of the 1990s\". In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted it the third greatest Britpop song in a poll (after \"Common People\" by Pulp and \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" by Oasis). In 2004, it was ranked at number 392 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".

The original sailed during the American Revolutionary War and harassed British shipping. Post war, the vessel was used as a merchant trading vessel in the Pacific. A somewhat updated modern replica was created in 1989. The replica has appeared in numerous films and television shows, standing in as other real or fictional ships.\n\nThe original \"Lady Washington\", or more commonly, \"Washington\", was a 90-ton brig. Her early history is documented in the \"Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War\" as well as other documents. As part of the Columbia Expedition, she left Boston Harbor on October 1, 1787. She sailed around Cape Horn and participated in the maritime fur trade with the coastal Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest and in tea and porcelain across the Pacific in China. She was the first American-flagged vessel to round Cape Horn. She was the first recorded vessel to make landfall on the Oregon coast near Tillamook, Oregon. John Meares claimed that she was the first non-native vessel to circumnavigate Vancouver Island.\n\nNamed in honor of Martha Washington, she was captained during the American Revolutionary War by Naler Hatch, and post war by Robert Gray, and John Kendrick, former captain of her larger sailing partner, \"Columbia Rediviva\" and commander of the expedition. At the end of the first trading season, Kendrick ordered Gray to sail \"Columbia\" to China, while Kendrick took command of \"Lady Washington\" . Under the command of Kendrick, she was refitted in Macau as a brigantine.\n\n\"Lady Washington\" became the first American vessel to reach Japan in an unsuccessful attempt to move some unsold pelts. \"Lady Washington\" remained in the Pacific trade and eventually foundered in the Philippines in 1797. She was lost at the mouth of the Mestizo River, near Vigan, northwest Luzon in July 1797.\n\nA ship replica of \"Lady Washington\" was built in Aberdeen, Washington, United States in time for the 1989 Washington State Centennial celebrations. Aberdeen is located on Grays Harbor, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean named for Robert Gray, the man who entered the harbor under sail for the first time as master of \"Columbia\".\n\nNamed \"Washington State's Tall Ship Ambassador\", as well as the State Ship, the new \"Lady Washington\" is operated by a professional and volunteer crew under the auspices of the Grays Harbor Historical Seaport Authority. She sails up and down the Pacific coast, regularly in pair with \"Hawaiian Chieftain\", educating students in the history of merchant trading, life of common sailors, and responsibilities of the ship's officers.\n\nThe current replica's mainmast is rigged with a topgallant sail and topsail above a gaff mainsail, as based on the post-Macau refit configuration. Old World (UK/international) terminology refers to this sail plan as brigantine, and New World (American) terminology refers to this as a brig. (Refer to the explanation sections on the brig, brigantine, and sail plan pages for more information.)\n\n\"Lady Washington\" has appeared in various films, portraying HMS \"Interceptor\" in the film \"\" and the brig \"Enterprise\", a namesake of the Starship \"Enterprise\", on the holodeck in \"Star Trek Generations\". She provided the basis for the RLS \"Legacy\" in the Disney animated feature \"Treasure Planet\". She also transported Chinese immigrants to America in the IMAX film \"The Great American West\". On television, the ship played a prominent role in the miniseries \"Blackbeard\", and has appeared in the music video for rapper Macklemore's \"Can't Hold Us\" and as Captain Hook's ship the \"Jolly Roger\" on \"Once Upon a Time\". The ship is the central visual element for Christian music group For KING & COUNTRY in their music video Burn the Ships.\n\n\n"}

Built in 1859–1860, it was the first area of Jewish settlement in Jerusalem outside the Old City walls, and was one of the first structures to be built outside the Old City of Jerusalem, the others being Kerem Avraham, the Schneller Orphanage, Bishop Gobat school and the Russian Compound.\n\nMishkenot Sha'anim was built by British Jewish banker and philanthropist Sir Moses Montefiore in 1860, having acquired the land from the Governor of Jerusalem, Ahmad Agha Duzdar. It was built as an almshouse, paid for by the estate of an American Jewish businessman from New Orleans, Judah Touro. Since it was outside the walls and open to Bedouin raids, pillage and general banditry rampant in the region at the time, the Jews were reluctant to move in, even though the housing was luxurious compared to the derelict and overcrowded houses in the Old City. As an incentive, people were even paid to live there, and a stone wall was built around the compound with a heavy door that was locked at night. The name of the neighborhood was taken from the Book of Isaiah: \"My people will abide in peaceful habitation, in secure \"dwellings\" and in \"quiet\" resting places\" (). It later became part of Yemin Moshe which was established in 1892–1894.\n\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when the Old City was captured by the Arab Legion, Mishkenot Sha'ananim bordered on no man's land in proximity to the armistice line with the Kingdom of Jordan, and many residents left in the wake of sniper attacks by Jordanian Arab Legionnaires. Only the poorest inhabitants remained, turning the complex into a slum.\n\nThe no-man's-land bordering Mishkenot Sha'ananim was captured by Israel during the 1967 War, together with the rest of Eastern and Old Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1973, Mishkenot Sha'ananim was turned into an upscale guesthouse for internationally acclaimed authors, artists and musicians visiting Israel. Apart from guesthouse facilities, it is now a convention center and home of the Jerusalem Music Center. The music center was inaugurated by Pablo Casals shortly before his death.\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Ethics was established in Mishkenot Sha'ananim in 1997. The board of directors is headed by Prof. Yitzhak Zamir, a retired justice of the Israeli Supreme Court.\n"}

He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal, when he won the Morris Trophy as the top offensive lineman in the Pac-10 Conference in 2002. He was selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the 26th overall pick in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft.\n\nHarris played high school football in Delaware, and was among the top prep offensive lineman in the country. He played three years at Stanford, twice earning all-conference honors and earning named honorable mention All-American in his final season. Harris was among the top-rated offensive linemen available in the 2003 draft, and he played five seasons with the 49ers and one with Oakland Raiders. He was a starter for most of his career, but often struggled with blocking and committing penalties.\n\nHarris was born in Jamaica and came to the United States when he was three years old. His family first settled in The Bronx, New York before moving to Delaware, where Harris' father operated multiple successful restaurants. Harris started playing the piano at age five and the violin in seventh grade. He grew up in Newark, Delaware, and attended Newark High School. Harris played violin in his high school orchestra along with playing high school football. He was a unanimous All-American selection and generally considered one of the top prep offensive linemen in the nation.\n\nAs a child, Harris knew he was attracted to men. In high school, when confronted by his mom about his sexuality, he came out as gay to his family. Not all of them were initially supportive, contributing to Harris's decision to attend Stanford University on the opposite coast.\n\nHarris was a music major at Stanford. He played three years of football for the Cardinal, and he was a two-year starter at right tackle. Harris played seven games at left tackle in his freshman year, when he was the team's top reserve offensive lineman. He became one of the top lineman in the Pac-10 Conference, earning Second-Team All-Pac-10 honors in his sophomore year after starting 12 games at right tackle. In his final season in 2002, Harris started 11 games, and he was named First-Team All-Pac-10 and won the Morris Trophy as the top offensive lineman in the conference. He was also an honorable mention All-American and an honorable mention Academic All-Pac-10. Harris gave up his final year of eligibility at Stanford to enter the NFL.\n\nHarris was ranked the No. 2 offensive tackle available in the 2003 NFL Draft, behind only Jordan Gross. He was selected in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft with the 26th overall pick by the San Francisco 49ers, and he played five seasons with the team. He started 37 consecutive games from 2004–2007, beginning with the final five games of 2004 at left tackle, followed by 32 games at right tackle the two years after. Harris was a good run blocker, but he was inconsistent on pass protection, struggling to block defensive linemen while frequently committing penalties. He allowed nine sacks and committed 15 penalties including seven false starts in 2005, and eight sacks with four holding penalties and one false start the following year. The 49ers drafted Joe Staley in the first round in 2007, and he won the starting job at right tackle as Harris was relegated to a backup role in his final year.\n\nIn 2008, Harris signed a three-year contract for $16 million with the Oakland Raiders, who hoped that line coach Tom Cable could revive his career. He started 11 games that year. Late in the season, however, he again struggled with his blocking and penalties, and the Raiders released him after the season.\n\nHe retired after being cut in 2010 by the Florida Tuskers in the United Football League, and he was replaced by former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive guard Darnell Stapleton. He played six seasons in his NFL career, starting 55 times in 86 games. Profootballtalk.com called Harris \"a major disappointment in the pros.\" Harris partly attributed his decline to the pressure of hiding his sexuality.\n\nHarris returned to college after retiring from football in order to complete his undergraduate degree.\n\nOn November 4, 2013, Harris was convicted on misdemeanor counts of domestic violence, assault and battery against his ex-boyfriend, Dimitri Geier, stemming from an incident on August 21, 2012. He was acquitted of felony counts of domestic violence causing great bodily injury and assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury. Geier also sued Harris for assault, battery, false imprisonment, negligence and both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, but later dropped the lawsuit. According to the suit, Harris became upset and the two men argued after Geier poured soy sauce on a plate of rice at a restaurant in Menlo Park, California. The situation escalated as the two exchanged blows. Harris' attorney, Alin Cintean, said Geier assaulted Harris first. \"Unfortunately, Mr. Geier is the one who ended up with an injury,\" he said. Harris' defense team argued that the statute of limitations on the misdemeanor charges for the 2012 incident had expired. However, the judge sentenced Harris to five days in jail and three years of probation, and ordered him to take domestic violence counseling and pay a fine.\n\nAfter the incident became public, Cintean stated that Harris identifies as gay, remarking that \"he is a very private person. He doesn't like to talk about his personal life.\" On March 29, 2013, Harris came out as gay during an interview with CNN. Until Michael Sam in 2014, no NFL player had come out while they were playing, and only a few had after retiring.\n\nHarris' younger brother, Orien, also played in the NFL as a defensive tackle. Their older brother, Duevorn, was a defensive tackle in the Arena Football League.\n\n"}

{"id": "1987293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987293", "title": "Contact angle", "text": "Contact angle\n\nThe contact angle is the angle, conventionally measured through the liquid, where a liquid–vapor interface meets a solid surface. It quantifies the wettability of a solid surface by a liquid via the Young equation. A given system of solid, liquid, and vapor at a given temperature and pressure has a unique equilibrium contact angle. However, in practice a dynamic phenomenon of contact angle hysteresis is often observed, ranging from the advancing (maximal) contact angle to the receding (minimal) contact angle. The equilibrium contact is within those values, and can be calculated from them. The equilibrium contact angle reflects the relative strength of the liquid, solid, and vapour molecular interaction.\n\nThe shape of a liquid–vapor interface is determined by the Young–Dupré equation, with the contact angle playing the role of a boundary condition via the Young equation.\n\nThe theoretical description of contact arises from the consideration of a thermodynamic equilibrium between the three phases: the liquid phase (L), the solid phase (S), and the gas or vapor phase (G) (which could be a mixture of ambient atmosphere and an equilibrium concentration of the liquid vapor). (The \"gaseous\" phase could be replaced by another immiscible liquid phase.) If the solid–vapor interfacial energy is denoted by formula_1, the solid–liquid interfacial energy by formula_2, and the liquid–vapor interfacial energy (i.e. the surface tension) by formula_3, then the equilibrium contact angle formula_4 is determined from these quantities by the Young equation:\n\nThe contact angle can also be related to the work of adhesion via the Young–Dupré equation:\n\nwhere formula_7 is the solid – liquid adhesion energy per unit area when in the medium G.\n\nThe earliest study on the relationship between contact angle and surface tensions for sessile droplets on flat surfaces was reported by Thomas Young in 1805. A century later Gibbs proposed a modification to Young’s equation to account for the volumetric dependence of the contact angle. Gibbs postulated the existence of a line tension, which acts at the three-phase boundary and accounts for the excess energy at the confluence of the solid-liquid-gas phase interface, and is given as:\n\nwhere \"κ\"[\"N\"] is the line tension and \"a\"[\"m\"] is the droplet radius. Although experimental data validates an affine relationship between the cosine of the contact angle and the inverse line radius, it does not account for the correct sign of κ and overestimates its value by several orders of magnitude.\n\nWith improvements in measuring techniques such as atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscope, researchers were able to produce and image droplets at ever smaller scales. With the reduction in droplet size came new experimental observations of wetting. These observations confirmed that the modified Young’s equation does not hold at the micro-nano scales. Jasper proposed that including a \"V\" \"dP\" term in the variation of the free energy may be the key to solving the contact angle problem at such small scales. Given that the variation in free energy is zero at equilibrium:\n\nThe variation in the pressure at the free liquid-vapor boundary is due to Laplace pressure, which is proportional to the mean Gaussian curvature. Solving the above equation for both convex and concave surfaces yields:\n\nwhere formula_11, formula_12 and formula_13.\n\nThis equation relates the contact angle, a geometric property of a sessile droplet to the bulk thermodynamics, the energy at the three phase contact boundary, and the mean curvature of the droplet. For the special case of a sessile droplet on a flat surface formula_14:\n\nIn the above equation, the first two terms are the modified Young’s equation, while the third term is due to the Laplace pressure. This nonlinear equation correctly predicts the sign and magnitude of κ, the flattening of the contact angle at very small scales, and contact angle hysteresis.\n\nA given substrate-liquid-vapor combination yields a continuous range of contact angle values in practice. The maximum contact angle is referred to as the advancing contact angle and the minimum contact angle is referred to as the receding contact angle. The advancing and receding contact angles are measured from dynamic experiments where droplets or liquid bridges are in movement. In contrast, the equilibrium contact angle described by the Young-LaPlace equation is measured from a static state. Static measurements yield values in-between the advancing and receding contact angle depending on deposition parameters (e.g. velocity, angle, and drop size) and drop history (e.g. evaporation from time of deposition). Contact angle hysteresis is defined as formula_16although the term is also used to describe the expression formula_17.The static, advancing, or receding contact angle can be used in place of the equilibrium contact angle depending on the application.\n\nThe advancing contact angle can be described as a measure of the liquid-solid cohesion while the receding contact angle is a measure of liquid-solid adhesion. The advancing and receding contact angles can be measured directly using different methods and can also be calculated from other wetting measurements such as force tensiometery (aka Wilhemy-Plate method).\n\nAdvancing and receding contact angles can be measured directly from the same measurement if drops are moved linearly on a surface. For example, a drop of liquid will adopt a given contact angle when static, but when the surface is tilted the drop will initially deform so that the contact area between the drop and surface remains constant. The \"downhill\" side of the drop will adopt a higher contact angle while the \"uphill\" side of the drop will adopt a lower contact angle. As the tilt angle increases the contact angles will continue to change but the contact area between the drop and surface will remain constant. At a given surface tilt angle, the advancing and receding contact angles will be met and the drop will move on the surface. In practice, the measurement can be influenced by shear forces and momentum if the tilt velocity is high. The measurement method can also be challenging in practice for systems with high (>30 degrees) or low (<10 degrees) contact angle hysteresis.\n\nAdvancing and receding contact angle measurements can be carried out by adding and removing liquid from a drop deposited on a surface. If a sufficiently small volume of liquid is added to a drop, the contact line will still be pinned, and the contact angle will increase. Similarly, if a small amount of liquid is removed from a drop, the contact angle will decrease.\n\nThe Young's equation assumes a homogeneous surface and does not account for surface texture or outside forces such as gravity. Real surfaces are not atomically smooth or chemically homogeneous so a drop will assume contact angle hysteresis. The equilibrium contact angle (formula_18) can be calculated from formula_19 and formula_20 as was shown theoretically by Tadmor and confirmed experimentally by Chibowski as,\n\nwhere\n\nOn a surface that is rough or contaminated, there will also be contact angle hysteresis, but now the local equilibrium contact angle (the Young equation is now only locally valid) may vary from place to place on the surface. According to the Young–Dupré equation, this means that the adhesion energy varies locally – thus, the liquid has to overcome local energy barriers in order to wet the surface. One consequence of these barriers is contact angle hysteresis: the extent of wetting, and therefore the observed contact angle (averaged along the contact line), depends on whether the liquid is advancing or receding on the surface.\n\nBecause liquid advances over previously dry surface but recedes from previously wet surface, contact angle hysteresis can also arise if the solid has been altered due to its previous contact with the liquid (e.g., by a chemical reaction, or absorption). Such alterations, if slow, can also produce measurably time-dependent contact angles.\n\nSurface roughness has a strong effect on the contact angle and wettability of a surface. The effect of roughness depends on if the droplet will wet the surface grooves or if air pockets will be left between the droplet and the surface.\n\nIf the surface is wetted homogeneously, the droplet is in Wenzel state. In Wenzel state, adding surface roughness will enhance the wettability caused by the chemistry of the surface. The Wenzel correlation can be written as\nwhere \"θ\" is the measured contact angle, θ is the Young contact angle and r is the roughness ratio. The roughness ratio is defined as the ratio between the actual and projected solid surface area.\n\nIf the surface is wetted heterogeneously, the droplet is in Cassie-Baxter state. The most stable contact angle can be connected to the Young contact angle. The contact angles calculated from the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter equations have been found to be good approximations of the most stable contact angles with real surfaces.\n\nFor liquid moving quickly over a surface, the contact angle can be altered from its value at rest. The advancing contact angle will increase with speed, and the receding contact angle will decrease. The discrepancies between static and dynamic contact angles are closely proportional to the capillary number, noted formula_24 .\n\nOn the basis of interfacial energies, the profile of a surface droplet or a liquid bridge between two surfaces can be described by the Young–Laplace equation. This equation is applicable for three-dimensional axisymmetric conditions and is highly non-linear. This is due to the mean curvature term which includes products of first- and second-order derivatives of the drop shape function formula_25:\n\nSolving this elliptic partial differential equation that governs the shape of a three-dimensional drop, in conjunction with appropriate boundary conditions, is complicated, and an alternate energy minimization approach to this is generally adopted. The shapes of three-dimensional sessile and pendant drops have been successfully predicted using this energy minimisation method.\n\nContact angles are extremely sensitive to contamination; values reproducible to better than a few degrees are generally only obtained under laboratory conditions with purified liquids and very clean solid surfaces. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the solid molecules then the liquid drop will completely spread out on the solid surface, corresponding to a contact angle of 0°. This is often the case for water on bare metallic or ceramic surfaces, although the presence of an oxide layer or contaminants on the solid surface can significantly increase the contact angle. Generally, if the water contact angle is smaller than 90°, the solid surface is considered hydrophilic and if the water contact angle is larger than 90°, the solid surface is considered hydrophobic. Many polymers exhibit hydrophobic surfaces. Highly hydrophobic surfaces made of low surface energy (e.g. fluorinated) materials may have water contact angles as high as ≈ 120°. Some materials with highly rough surfaces may have a water contact angle even greater than 150°, due to the presence of air pockets under the liquid drop. These are called superhydrophobic surfaces.\n\nIf the contact angle is measured through the gas instead of through the liquid, then it should be replaced by 180° minus their given value. Contact angles are equally applicable to the interface of two liquids, though they are more commonly measured in solid products such as non-stick pans and waterproof fabrics.\n\nControl of the wetting contact angle can often be achieved through the deposition or incorporation of various organic and inorganic molecules onto the surface. This is often achieved through the use of specialty silane chemicals which can form a SAM (self-assembled monolayers) layer. With the proper selection of the organic molecules with varying molecular structures and amounts of hydrocarbon and/or perfluoronated terminations, the contact angle of the surface can tune. The deposition of these specialty silanes can be achieved in the gas phase through the use of a specialized vacuum ovens or liquid-phase process. Molecules that can bind more perfluorinated terminations to the surface can results in lowering the surface energy (high water contact angle).\n\nThe sessile drop contact angle is measured by a contact angle goniometer using an optical subsystem to capture the profile of a pure liquid on a solid substrate. The angle formed between the liquid–solid interface and the liquid–vapor interface is the contact angle. Older systems used a microscope optical system with a back light. Current-generation systems employ high resolution cameras and software to capture and analyze the contact angle. Angles measured in such a way are often quite close to advancing contact angles. Equilibrium contact angles can be obtained through the application of well defined vibrations.\n\nMeasuring contact angles for pendant drops is much more complicated than for sessile drops due to the inherent unstable nature of inverted drops. This complexity is further amplified when one attempts to incline the surface. Experimental apparatus to measure pendant drop contact angles on inclined substrates has been developed recently. This method allows for the deposition of multiple microdrops on the underside of a textured substrate, which can be imaged using a high resolution CCD camera. An automated system allows for tilting the substrate and analysing the images for the calculation of advancing and receding contact angles.\n\nThe dynamic sessile drop is similar to the static sessile drop but requires the drop to be modified. A common type of dynamic sessile drop study determines the largest contact angle possible without increasing its solid–liquid interfacial area by adding volume dynamically. This maximum angle is the advancing angle. Volume is removed to produce the smallest possible angle, the receding angle. The difference between the advancing and receding angle is the contact angle hysteresis.\n\nA method for calculating average advancing and receding contact angles on solids of uniform geometry. Both sides of the solid must have the same properties. Wetting force on the solid is measured as the solid is immersed in or withdrawn from a liquid of known surface tension. Also in that case it is possible to measure the equilibrium contact angle by applying a very controlled vibration. That methodology, called VIECA, can be implemented in a quite simple way on every Wilhelmy balance.\n\nDynamic Wilhelmy method applied to single fibers to measure advancing and receding contact angles.\nAn optical variation of the single-fiber Wilhelmy method. Instead of measuring with a balance, the shape of the meniscus on the fiber is directly imaged using a high resolution camera. Automated meniscus shape fitting can then directly measure the static, advancing or receding contact angle on the fiber.\n\nIn case of a porous materials many issues have been raised both about the physical meaning of the calculated pore diameter and the real possibility to use this equation for the calculation of the contact angle of the solid, even if this method is often offered by much software as consolidated.

It offers workshops and exhibits which allow childen to produce their own media through various interactive, creative processes: stop motion animation, programming robots, music video production, design challenges, art projects, and more. It has around 100,000 museum visitors annually (as of 2016/17). The Children's Creativity Museum is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, with annual revenues of around $2.1 million (as of 2016/17), including $600,000 of funding from the city of San Francisco.\n\nThe Children's Creativity Museum opened as Zeum on October 31, 1998 as part of a major urban renewal project in the South of Market area by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. It is housed in a two-story building, constructed on top of the Moscone Convention Center, which includes a 200-seat theatre and 3,000 square feet of exhibition space. The museum includes a 1906 carousel by Charles I. D. Looff.\n\nZeum changed its name to Children's Creativity Museum in 2011 to increase awareness about the museum's purpose. In a press release announcing the name change, it stated: \"Although the name Zeum sounded fun, it didn't provide parents with any clues about what they and their children would experience. With that understanding, our verbal branding team identified two primary goals the new name needed to accomplish: It had to be descriptive enough to indicate who it was for, but also suggestive enough to encompass the broad range of imaginative activities participants could take part in. After vetting over 200 names with Zeum leadership, it was agreed that the name \"Children's Creativity Museum\" accomplished both goals.\"\n\nIn the Animation Studio, children can mold clay characters and make their own stop-motion animation movie. In this exhibit, museum educators introduce film making concepts: making a storyboard, building the characters, and producing a stop-motion animation. Afterward, visitors can stop by one of five stop-motion animation stations, choose different set backdrops to set the scene, and capture their footage frame by frame using a video camera. Once the movie is complete, copies of the video are emailed to visitors.\n\nIn the Tech Lab, children are introduced to coding by learning how to program a robot to complete a series of tasks, navigate mazes, and play games. Each activity is designed to promote creative problem-solving in novice programmers. More experienced coders can program robots to respond to sensor inputs and use loops to avoid obstacles.\n\nIn the Innovation Lab, visitors are invited to put their problem-solving and critical thinking skills to the test in working with basic, limited materials to create a prototype for a solution to a problem.\n\nIn the Making Music Studio, visitors experiment with instruments and original sounds to make music. Your original music creation changes as you move from one area of the exhibit to another. Families will discover that music comes from unexpected places. Your original score is available to download and take home. \n\n"}

The wheel arrangement was principally used on Mallet-type articulated locomotives. Some tank locomotive examples were also built, for which various suffixes to indicate the type of tank would be added to the wheel arrangement, for example for an engine with side-tanks.\n\nThe 2-6-6-0 wheel arrangement was most often used for articulated compound steam Mallet locomotives. In a compound Mallet, the rear set of coupled wheels are driven by the smaller high pressure cylinders, from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low pressure cylinders that drive the front set of coupled wheels.\n\nThe sole NZR E class locomotive of 1906 was the only 2-6-6-0T locomotive ever built for and used by the New Zealand Railways Department. It was built at the Petone Workshops in Wellington and was designed for use on the world famous Rimutaka Incline. Numbered 66, making it E 66, it spent the first part of its working life in the Wellington region hauling trains up and down the Rimutaka Incline. It was eventually transferred to the Wellington-Johnsonville section for banking duties, even though it was not designed for that type of work. In 1917, E 66 was withdrawn from service and scrapped.

Jesus, who has been fasting in the desert, has just been encouraged by Satan to make bread from stones to relieve his hunger, in this verse he rejects this idea.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:4\n\nJesus rebuts Satan's advances by quoting scripture. The verse in question is from . In its original context the verse is describing how while wandering through the wilderness in Exodus the Israelites lacked food. Despite God's promises they complained and worried about their hunger, but in the end God provided manna to feed them all. This same reply is also quoted in , though in Luke it is somewhat abbreviated not containing \"but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.\" The quote uses the exact wording of the Septuagint, but Hill notes that it is not an exact translation of the original Hebrew which has \"everything\" rather than \"every word.\" Gundry feels the author of Matthew added this section to emphasize Jesus' obedience to God. Jones states that by replying with nothing but quotes from scripture Jesus illustrates his \"perfect detachment from everything except God's will.\"\n\nJesus rejects Satan's idea, and uses nothing but a word of scripture as his argument. France notes that God's word would not literally make up for not having any food. Instead it is a question of priority. If God instructed Jesus to fast in the desert, then it is that word that must be followed and it takes priority over any feelings such as hunger.\n\nThere are a number of explanations for why Satan attempted to have Jesus turn stones into bread and why it was important that Jesus refuse. The act of using God's powers to create bread is not in itself wrong, as demonstrated in Matthew 14 and 15 where Jesus actually does perform this miracle. In the Middle Ages it became common to argue that Satan was simply tempting Christ into gluttony. Most modern scholars do not accept this view. France notes that \"tempt\" should better be translated as \"test\" that Satan was testing Jesus' understanding of his role rather than luring him into evil. Jones notes that calling someone who has fasted for forty days gluttonous because they want food is not very fair. Most modern scholars thus reject the sin explanation. Another view that was popular for a time was that this represented Jesus rejecting the role of the \"economic messiah,\" that in this verse he demonstrates that it is not his role to feed the hungry of the world, but rather to provide spiritual sustenance. The most popular view today is that this passage echoes the history of Israel. The quote itself comes from the part of the Old Testament describing the period after the Exodus when the Israelites were wandering hungry in the wilderness and complaining about their hunger. This verse is seen to demonstrate that Jesus does not make the same mistake they did and accepts that God will ensure his safety.\n\nThe phrase \"man shall not live by bread alone\" is today a common expression meaning that people need more than material things to truly live. However, it is also sometimes used in almost the opposite sense to justify materials luxuries beyond simple things like bread. Fortna notes that the word usually translated as \"man\" would more accurately be replaced by \"human beings\" as in the original Greek it is gender neutral.\n"}

Lewis lived most of her life in poverty in a small house in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia, achieving national recognition in 1964 and 1965. Several books, plays and films have since been produced about her. Lewis remains one of Canada's best-known folk artists; her works and the restored Maud Lewis House are displayed in the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia.\n\nLewis was born Maud Kathleen Dowley on March 7, 1903 in South Ohio, Nova Scotia, the daughter of John and Agnes (Germain) Dowley. She had one brother. She was born with birth defects and ultimately developed rheumatoid arthritis, which reduced her mobility, especially in her hands. Dowley was introduced to art by her mother, who instructed her in the making of watercolour Christmas cards to sell. She began her artistic career by selling hand-drawn and painted Christmas cards.\n\nDowley became involved with Emery Allen, also of Digby, who has been described as the love of her life. She gave birth to their daughter, Catherine Dowley, in 1928 out of wedlock. After Allen abandoned Dowley and their daughter, Dowley continued to live at home with her parents. It was arranged by the court for her daughter Catherine to be adopted, as Dowley had no way to support her. Later in life Catherine married Paul Muise and had her own family; they lived in Nova Scotia and Ontario. She apparently tried to contact her mother, but was not successful.\n\nIn 1935, Dowley's father John died; in 1937, her mother Agnes died in 1939 After living with her brother for a short while, she moved to Digby, Nova Scotia to live with her aunt.\n\nDowley married Everett Lewis, a fish peddler from Marshalltown, on January 16, 1938 at the age of 34. Everett Lewis also worked as the watchman at the county Poor Farm. According to Everett, Maud Dowley showed up at his door step in response to an advertisement he had posted in the local stores for a \"live-in or keep house\" for a forty-year-old bachelor. Several weeks later, they married.\n\nThe two lived in Everett's one-room house with a sleeping loft in Marshalltown, a few miles west of Digby. Maud used this house as her studio; Everett took care of the housework. The pair lived mostly in poverty in the one-room house. \n\nMaud Lewis accompanied her husband on his daily rounds peddling fish door-to-door, bringing along Christmas cards that she had drawn. She would sell the cards for twenty-five cents each. These cards proved popular with her husband's customers, and she began painting. Everett encouraged Lewis to paint, and he bought her her first set of oils.\n\nShe expanded her range, using other surfaces for painting, such as pulp boards (beaverboards), cookie sheets, and Masonite. Lewis was a prolific artist and also painted on more or less every available surface in their tiny home: walls, doors, breadboxes, and even the stove. She completely covered the simple patterned commercial wallpaper with sinewy stems, leaves, and blossoms.\n\nLewis used bright colours in her paintings, and subjects were often flowers or animals, including oxen teams, horses, birds, deer, or cats. Many of her paintings are of outdoor scenes, including Cape Island boats bobbing on the water, horses pulling a sleigh, skaters, and portraits of dogs, cats, deer, birds, and cows. Her paintings were inspired by childhood memories of the landscape and people around Yarmouth and South Ohio, as well as Digby locations, such as Point Prim and Bayview. Commercial Christmas cards and calendars also influenced her.\n\nHer paintings are often quite small - often no larger than eight by ten inches, although she is known to have done at least five paintings 24 inches by 36 inches. The size was limited by the extent she could move her arms, which had been affected by arthritis. She used mostly wallboard and tubes of Tinsol, an oil-based paint. Lewis' technique consisted of first coating the board with white, then drawing an outline, and applying paint directly out of the tube. She never blended or mixed colours.\n\nEarly Maud Lewis paintings from the 1940s are quite rare. A large collection of Lewis' work can be found in the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (AGNS). The AGNS occasionally displays the Chaplin/Wennerstrom shutters (now part of the Clearwater Fine Foods Inc. collection). This collection comprises twenty-two exterior house shutters that Lewis painted in the early 1940s. The work was done for some Americans who owned a cottage on the South Shore. Most of the shutters are quite large, at 5 ft x 1 ft.6 inches. Lewis was paid 70 cents a shutter.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950, people began to stop at Lewis' Marshalltown home on Highway No. 1, the main highway and tourist route in western Nova Scotia. They bought her paintings for two or three dollars each. Only in the last three or four years of Lewis' life did her paintings begin to sell for seven to ten dollars. She achieved national attention as a folk artist following an article in the Toronto-based \"Star Weekly\" in 1964. In 1965, she was featured on CBC-TV's \"Telescope\". Two of Lewis' paintings were ordered by the White House in the 1970s during Richard Nixon's presidency. But her arthritis limited her ability to complete many of the orders that had come from her national recognition.\n\nHer paintings have sold at auction for ever increasing prices. On November 30, 2009, \"A Family Outing\" sold for $22,200 at a Bonham's auction in Toronto. Another painting, \"A View of Sandy Cove\", sold in 2012 for $20,400. A painting found in 2016 at an Ontario thrift store, \"Portrait of Eddie Barnes and Ed Murphy, Lobster Fishermen\", sold in an online auction for $45,000.\n\nIn the last year of her life, Maud Lewis stayed in one corner of her house, painting as often as she could while traveling back and forth to the hospital for treatment of health issues. She died in Digby on July 30, 1970 from pneumonia. Her husband Everett was killed in 1979 by a burglar during an attempted robbery of the couple's house.\n\n\nMaud Lewis is the subject of a book by Lance Woolaver, \"The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis\", and three National Film Board of Canada documentaries: \"Maud Lewis - A World Without Shadows\" (1976), \"The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis\" (1998), and \"I Can Make Art ... Like Maud Lewis\" (2005). The latter is a short film in which a group of Grade 6 students are inspired by Lewis' work to create their own folk art painting.\n\nIn 2009, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, in conjunction with Greg Thompson Productions, produced a new play about Lewis at the AGNS. \"A Happy Heart: The Maud Lewis Story\" was written and produced by Greg Thompson, who had produced \"Marilyn: Forever Blonde\" at the AGNS in January 2008. Thompson wrote the one-woman play about Lewis while in Nova Scotia in 2008. The play ran until October 25, 2009.\n\nScreenwriter Sherry White wrote a script for a feature dramatic film about Lewis, entitled \"Maudie\" (2016). \"Maudie\" made its Canadian debut at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was directed by Aisling Walsh, and stars Sally Hawkins as Maud and Ethan Hawke as Everett Lewis.\n\n\n"}

Often wearing dress suits and armed with metal-weighted walking sticks, gang members were able to attack and rob wealthier victims surprising those who would have been suspicious of other poorer gangs of the period. \n\nThroughout the decade, rival gangs would attempt to compete with the gang's success. One incident in particular occurred when, after the Batavia Street Gang announced hosting a party at New Irving Hall, the Cherry Hillers planned to arrive in expensive wardrobe. Not to be outdone, as hosts of the party, the Batavia Street Gang robbed Segal's Jewelry Store on New Chambers Street of 44 gold rings. The following morning however, shortly after selling the rings at a local pawn shop, over a dozen gang members were arrested by police while being fitted for suits at a tailors shop on Division Street spending that night in The Tombs while the Cherry Hill Gang and others attended the party. \n\nBy the early 20th century the Cherry Hill Gang was regarded as the most vicious gang in the city. Their main rivals were the Whyos, but they fought just as vigorously amongst each other. Many Cherry Hillers such as Yakey Yake Brady, Monk Eastman and Bill \"The Brute\" Sanger formed sub-gangs of their own and feuded constantly over turf and power.\n\n"}

It is best known for being Elvis Presley's seventh single release on the RCA Victor label. It was released in May 1956, becoming Presley's second number 1 single on the country music charts, and peaking at number 3 on the US \"Billboard\" Top 100 chart, an earlier version of the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Before the creation of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in 1958, there were a number of charts including Jukebox plays, Store charts, and Airplay charts; the song reached number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Top Sellers in Stores chart.\n\nDuring April 1956, \"Variety\" reported that Presley's sixth RCA Victor single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", had sold one million copies. RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes wanted a strong single for the next release, aware that there was not much good material available. Due to Presley's busy touring schedule, Sholes needed to get him into the studio as soon as possible. Presley and his band chartered a small propeller airplane to Nashville for one day of recording between shows.\n\nEn route from Amarillo, the airplane developed engine trouble and fell through the sky several times. Upon arrival in Nashville on the morning of April 14, all four were disconcerted. Presley arrived at the RCA Victor Studios without ideas for the recording session and therefore had no choice but to use Sholes' suggestions, one of which was \"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\".\n\nBeing used to later working hours, coupled with his traumatic experience during his overnight flight, the recording session was bad. Take after take was ruined for one reason or another and the band was not relaxed. Presley, usually a very quick study with a song, couldn't get the lyrics right. After 17 takes in three hours, Sholes decided Presley and the band weren't able to record properly and sent them home.\n\nAfter the session, Sholes listened to the takes again. He wasn't happy with the results of what he considered to be an unprofessional and wasted session. It had cost $1,000 to fly Presley and his band in by a private flight, and Sholes let Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, know that he was unsatisfied with the work and required material urgently for a second album. He knew that with Presley's busy touring schedule it could be months before RCA Victor got him back into a studio. Performing what was a very rare and generally unsuccessful procedure for the 1950s, Sholes took parts of two takes he liked (takes 14 and 17), cut and spliced them together to create a take worthy of release. His cuts were so seamless, nobody at RCA Victor could tell it wasn't from a single take.\n\n\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\" was backed with \"My Baby Left Me\" and was released on May 4, 1956. Pre-orders of over 300,000 were the biggest ever in the history of the company. At the time of its release, Presley had three songs in the Top 20: \"Heartbreak Hotel/I Was the One,\" \"My Baby Left Me\", and \"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\". On June 5, 1956, Presley performed the song on \"The Milton Berle Show\", as well as an early version of \"Hound Dog\" that resulted in both overwhelmingly favorable audience reaction and outrage.\n\nDespite the heated public controversy, the single was generally well received, reaching No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Top 100 popular music singles chart, and scoring No. 1 on the country music chart. The song earned a second Gold record for Presley, with sales in excess of 1.3 million.\n\nThis song was the inspiration for the Meat Loaf song \"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\". The song remains popular, as it is used for the themes of many organizations. The song particularly uses the lyrics: \"I want you, I need you/But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you\".\n\nJazz fusion/rock guitarist from The Doors, Robby Krieger performs an instrumental version of the song on his 1989 solo album, \"No Habla\".\n"}

Most of his works are among the best sellers of their own genre.\n\nZhou was born in Shanghai, where he grew up and attended Shanghai High School. After he graduated from Peking University in 1967, Zhou worked on a Hunan farm for one and a half years. He was later relocated to work in the Tzeyuan town in Guangxi, where he married his first wife, Minzi (Chinese: 敏子).\n\nZhou was motivated by the resumption of Gaokao, the Chinese college-entrance exam, and started to pursue higher education. In 1978, he left Guangxi and attended the Institute of Philosophy of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, where he received a masters and a PhD degree.\n\nIn the spring of 1980, Zhou’s first marriage ended. He then married Xiang Lingyu (Chinese: 项灵羽). When Zhou was 43, he had his first daughter Niuniu (Chinese: 妞妞), who was diagnosed with and died from a rare cancer, Retinoblastoma. His second marriage ended soon after Niuniu’s death.\n\nIn September 1997, Zhou started his third marriage with Guo Hong (Chinese: 郭红), who was twenty years younger than him. Together they had his second daughter Jiujiu (Chinese: 啾啾).\n\nZhou caused controversy in 2015 by a Weibo post which said that women were beautiful when cleaning the house or feeding babies, which led to him being accused of having straight man cancer.\n\n1988 Assistant researcher in the Institute of Philosophy of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\n\n1994 Researcher in the Institute of Philosophy of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\n\n2009 Professor of Southwest University of Political Science & Law\n\n2007 Advisor of National Central Library\n\n2013 Honorary Director of Hubei Provincial Library\n\nZhou was among the first group of scholars who began to study Friedrich Nietzsche after Chinese economic reform. He was first known for his dissertation \"Nietzsche: on the Turning Point of the Century\" and his translated work of Nietzsche’s \"the Birth of Tragedy.\"\n\nHe was further perceived by the public due to the popularity of his essay, some of which were selected in Chinese and Singapore textbooks because of their philosophical depth and precise use of language.\n\n\"Niuniu: the Reading Notes of a Father\" (Shanghai People's Publishing House, 2006) was written after the death of Niuniu (Zhou's first daughter) from Retinoblastoma, which was claimed as a result of her doctor’s irresponsible conducts. The book generally describes Zhou’s family life with Yuer and Niuniu and his experience as a father. His detachment from the reality in the book was, according to himself, a tool to relieve the pain.\n\n\"Men and Eternity\" (Shanghai People's Publishing House, 1987) was one of the most well-known work of Zhou and was re-published multiple times after its first publication in 1987. The book’s success in the market was attributed to Zhou’s genuine attitude regarding sharing his thoughts as well as the language precision in summarizing his philosophical viewpoints. In the form of short essays, Zhou expresses his thoughts on 26 broad topics, including life, nature, love, beauty and death. In \"Men and Eternity\", Zhou generally expresses the idea of contradiction by nature of these topics and the impossibility of their reconciliation. He points out the contradictions between mankind’s greatness as the only species possesses the ability to pursue the meaning of life and how the process itself degrades the meaning they are pursued, which leads to a nihilistic belief that the human race is a meaningless product of the meaning less universe, making meaningless effort to pursue meanings in its meaningless creator.\n\n\"The Starry Sky of thoughts\" (People's Literature Publishing House, 2009) was a selection of Zhou’s essays, covering topics from reflection of his life to philosophical discussions and comments on social phenomena. \"The Starry Sky of thoughts\" includes a great number of articles discussing his viewpoints on arts, including basic standards for arts and his definition of beauty. He states that the absence of audience was a necessary condition for the best and most genuine artwork as they are not affected by any external factors. Zhou also believes that no artworks presents a withering sense of beauty, as beauty is always healthy from artists’ perspectives. In the last few selected articles of the book, Zhou expresses his fear regarding the dominant role technologies play in the modern society. Zhou’s worry about the possibility that mankind was incapable of handling the technologies they invented was thought to embody his objection to utilitarianism and his pursuit of a simple and natural lifestyle.\n\n\"Souls Only Walk Alone\" (People's Literature Publishing House, 2009) is divided into 11 chapters. Covering topics from critiques of social phenomena to reading notes of the Bible, the book is centered around the philosophical discussion of love, souls and life. In \"Souls Only Walk Alone\", Zhou discussed his definition of a noble soul and its indispensability in a proper way of living. He states that for souls to function properly, people need to leave a space for souls alone and that the space should not and could not be shared with anyone else, including families and lovers. He also states that being alone is an inevitable yet beneficial state of souls. Zhou's definition of love as an interaction between two lonely souls instead of an emotional bond which removes the loneliness is thought to embody his pessimistic belief.\n\n\"Freestyle\" (People's Literature Publishing House, 2001) is coauthored by Zhou and the most renowned Chinese Rock musician, Cui Jian (Chinese: 崔健). The book records dialogues between Zhou and Cui across more than ten years. In the preface, Zhou states that his appreciation of Cui might come from their shared viewpoints on arts. Discussing the role of art in the society, they both agree on the importance of art as the ultimate and strongest factor behind politics and culture. They also share the belief that real art is always for the entire human race instead of various cultural groups. The book is viewed as an example of Zhou’s interdisciplinary interest.\n\n\"Niuniu: the Reading Notes of a Father\" mentioned that Niuniu's cancer was technically curable with a surgery. It was shown that Zhou and Xiang refused to sign the informed consent after knowing the probable consequences of blindness and reoccurrence in Niuniu's twenties. After its publication, the book has fostered numerous debates in medical ethics. Some readers held the belief that Zhou's decision ultimately killed his daughter and that the book was merely driven by hypocrisy.\n\nIn one article of \"the Starry Sky of thoughts\", Zhou states that from his viewpoint, the beauty of a woman will inevitably be compromised if she fails to become a good lover, wife, and mother. His words lead to criticisms from numerous feminists. Lu Ping (Chinese: 吕频), a feminist activist, argued that Zhou’s words “was not only ignorant about women, but also contained an arrogant attitude from his ivory tower.”\n\n"}

Her debut album \"Voodoo\" was independently released in 2010, followed by the demo release of \"The Basement Recordings\" in 2011, with its sequel, \"The Basement Recordings II\", and EP \"Skipping Stone\" in 2012. \"The Basement Recordings III\" was released in 2013. A follow-up extended play \"Heart\" followed in 2014; with her sophomore effort \"Let 'Em Eat Cake\" being released October of that year. Johnson's third studio album \"A Stranger Time\" was released in 2017. She announced in late 2019 an upcoming fourth studio album, that is currently in the mastering phase.\n\nShe is best known for her roles as Jude Harrison in the CTV series \"Instant Star\", as Annie Thelen in the Disney Channel series \"So Weird\", and as Erin Ulmer in the 2006 horror film \"Final Destination 3\". She was nominated three times for a Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series (\"Instant Star\"), winning the award in 2008.\n\nJohnson was born in New Westminster, British Columbia and raised in nearby Coquitlam. She is of Swedish, Scottish, and English descent. The sixth of ten children, Johnson says her family embraced the arts and being creative. One brother is an actor and screenwriter, another brother does graphic design, her younger brother performs music, and her brother Brendan is a singer-songwriter and music producer with whom she often collaborates.\n\nFrom age three, Johnson often sang for her large extended family. By age six, she was receiving vocal training, participating in festivals with her local youth choir by age seven, and giving solo performances at school and community functions. At age nine, she had entered the P.N.E. talent search, becoming a finalist. She participated in many talent contests and festivals, winning a National Anthem Contest at the age of 11, with her rendition of the Canadian National Anthem, \"O Canada\", heard on national television. This resulted in radio and television interviews, as well as interest from management. That year, she was voted Best Anthem singer of the season by the \"Vancouver Sun\".\n\nLocally, Johnson was often referred to as the \"West Coast Celine\" and sang the Canadian National Anthem at games for the NHL's Vancouver Canucks and the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies. She performed at charity events and fairs around the province, in addition to the BC Summer Games recording their theme song, \"Reach for the Stars\". She went on to appear on the Variety Club show singing a duet with Bob McGrath, sang the first set of songs at the Molson Indy (a major car race), and entertained on New Year's Eve at Planet Hollywood at the age of 12.\n\nAlthough Johnson was only focused on a music career at the time, she decided to pursue a career in acting at the age of 11, where she \"walked into an acting agency and told them [she] wanted to sing\". She landed auditions for commercials and a television pilot entitled \"Most Talented Kids\". in 1999.\n\nJohnson auditioned for the Disney Channel original series \"So Weird\", which was casting for a lead actress who could also sing for the final season of the show. At the age of 13, Johnson replaced the lead character in the Disney Channel series \"So Weird\" for the show's final season. Johnson portrayed the lead role of Annie Thelen, which combined her acting and musical talents. The role featured her singing alongside Mackenzie Phillips. She showed an interest in songwriting, co-writing one of the songs for the show.\n\nOn July 22, 2000, Johnson was featured in \"Billboard\" for the first time, she went on to be featured in sixteen different issues. Her highest ranking was number two in \"\"The Top 10 Favorite Artist Picks\"\" for \"\"The Most Popular New Talent on Broadband Talent Net\"\" as of June 2, 2001 after 33 weeks on. Her song \"Dream About You\" charted six different times and came in at number one in \"\"Radio Play Favorite Song Requests\"\" for \"\"The Most Listened-to New Tracks On Broadband Talent Net\"\" on November 11, 2000. Her song \"Wishing On A Star\" came in at number five in the same issue. Also \"Sunshine Reigns\" charted at number three on July 22, 2000.\n\nIn the year 2000, a song performed by Johnson entitled \"Everything (Feels Like New)\" was featured in the Disney Channel Original Movie \"The Other Me\", starring Andrew Lawrence. A full studio version of the song was never released.\n\nAfter the cancellation of \"So Weird\", Johnson continued her interest in songwriting, co-writing with her brother Brendan Johnson. Several labels offered her contracts, but she held off, wanting more creative control and a hand in the songwriting. In 2001, Johnson teamed up with the production/songwriting team of Johnny Elkins and CJ Vanston. Her song \"Transparent Lies\", was recorded for a compilation album titled \"Fill Your Head\". The album was compiled featuring several different artists with songs using certain words in order to help students with their SAT scores. Her work with Vanston and Elkins featured a more bubblegum pop sound than what she preferred and ended around 2003. Johnson continued to work with her brother Brendan recording their own music. These were the songs included on the demo CD sent to the executives of \"Instant Star\" with her audition tape.\n\nIn 2019 in an interview with \"The So Weird Podcast\", Johnson confirmed that her \"So Weird\" and \"Cold Squad\" co-star Belinda Metz played a key role in her landing the role of Jude Harrison in \"Instant Star\".\n\n]\nThroughout 2004, Johnson made various appearances on Canadian television series including \"The Chris Isaak Show\", \"The Collector\", and \"Cold Squad\". In 2005 she made guest appearances in the made-for-TV films including \"Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical\", as well as the role of Angel DeSousa in the Lifetime original movie \"Selling Innocence\".\n\nIn February 2004, Johnson sent in an audition tape to the producers of \"\" for their upcoming show \"Instant Star\". They were specifically looking for a Canadian teen actress/vocalist to play the lead role, Jude Harrison. The first audition tape Executive Producer Stephen Stohn received was Johnson's, and he was convinced she was perfect for the role. After its first season, \"Instant Star\" was nominated for three Gemini Awards (the Canadian equivalent of the American Emmy Award) in the category of Best Children's or Youth Fiction Program or Series, including a nomination for Best Performance (Alexz Johnson). On August 28, 2007, the show received three more Gemini Award nominations, in the category of Best Children's or Youth Program or Series, including another for Best Performance (Alexz Johnson, in the episode, \"I Fought the Law\").\n\nJohnson sang all of the songs that her character Jude, on \"Instant Star\" performed on the show. She recorded soundtracks for each of the four seasons of \"Instant Star\": \"Songs from Instant Star\", \"Songs from Instant Star Two\", \"Songs from Instant Star Three\", and \"Songs From Instant Star Four\". She wrote or co-wrote five of the songs on the first season's soundtrack, including \"24 Hours\", \"Let Me Fall\", \"Criminal, \"Skin\", and \"That Girl\", which Johnson had written before when she was fourteen.\n\nMost of the original recordings for the originally planned debut album were written by Johnson in early 2005, but she had yet to find a major label to help create and release the songs. In early 2006, Johnson announced she was leaving the indie Canadian label Orange Records that released the first two soundtracks to \"Instant Star\", in search of something to showcase her as an artist and not her fictional counterpart, Jude Harrison.\n\nJohnson auditioned for the role of Julie Christensen in the thriller \"Final Destination 3\". She showed up at the audition in an all-black, punk rockish outfit, later claiming that she was in a bad mood. The casting directors concluded she was a better fit for the role of Erin Ulmer, a character with a bad attitude. Her performance attracted praise from some critics, including one (writing for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\") who said: \"The characters are so loathsome, you're glad to see them go. Except for two: the goth couple Ian (Kris Lemche) and Erin (Alexz Johnson). He's a cynical know-it-all, like Dennis Miller with black fingernails; she's like Parker Posey with raccoon mascara..\" In 2007, Johnson starred in the Lifetime movie, \"Devil's Diary\", for which she received a Leo Award nomination, in the category of Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Feature-Length Drama.\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Johnson was nominated a third time for a Gemini award. On October 21, 2008, she won the Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series, for the \"Instant Star\" episode \"Let It Be.\" Johnson continued with \"Instant Star\" for four seasons, and expected to return for a fifth. This was interrupted when CTV and The N both pulled funding following the fourth season, which led to the cancellation of the series. This allowed Johnson to go back to focusing on her music.\n\nAfter a showcase in New York City, Johnson met with several labels and producers and chose Capitol Records, which allowed her to work with Paul Buckmaster, though her brother was the main producer of the material at the time. In writing songs for the album, she worked with UK writers Martin Terefe and Sacha Skarbek as well as producer/songwriter Brio Taliaferro. On June 25, 2007, Johnson appeared on MTV Canada. She confirmed that all of her songs had been written and recorded. She planned on shopping for a label over the next few months and hoped to release the album in the winter.\n\nOn February 15, 2008, she announced that she had signed a record deal with label Epic Records (part of the Sony BMG group), expecting the album to be released in the fall. Having heard the first six songs, Stephen Stohn, in his MySpace blog of February 16, 2008, commented that, \"they are just incredibly good – very different from the songs you've come to know through \"Instant Star\", much more rhythmic, with almost a world beat.\" In an interview in 2008, she described her upcoming album as \"pop with eclectic world rhythms and influences\", citing influences from \"older artists\" such as Paul Simon, Kate Bush, and Annie Lennox, and saying that she was \"trying to find a way to make those great older songs younger.\"\n\nThe producer for the album became Greg Wells after Johnson was introduced to him through his brother Rob Wells, one of the songwriters for \"Instant Star\". The new arrangement with Epic Records also affected the line-up of artists for the \"Instant Star\" 4 soundtrack, as the record label allowed her a maximum of four songs on \"Instant Star\" 4. In her MySpace blog of February 15, 2008, Johnson indicated that she was planning an extensive tour around her new album, saying of her songs that, \"I can't wait to perform them live! Looking forward to seeing all of your faces!\" Johnson also began working with multi-instrumentalist Luis Conte and legendary strings expert Paul Buckmaster. Five songs were posted on her MySpace page by her record company on June 11, 2008. These songs were supposed to appear in her upcoming album and were entitled: \"Easy\", \"Swallowed\", \"Chicago\", \"Golden\", and \"Running With the Devil\".\n\nJohnson appeared in the hit CW series \"Smallville\" episode \"Legion\", as the superheroine Saturn Girl. The episode aired on January 15, 2009. She was the second actress from Instant Star to appear in the show, the first one being Laura Vandervoort. She also appeared in the TV-movie version of the Lois Duncan novel \"Stranger With My Face\", in which she plays twin sisters who were separated at birth. She stated that the filming—which included a dramatic scene in which her two characters conflict through astral projection, leading to a fall off a cliff and into a waterfall—was so mentally and physically demanding, that she felt like she could never take on another role like it again. It premiered on Lifetime Movie network on August 29, 2009. The director of \"Stranger With My Face\", Jeff Renfroe, greatly praised what he saw when working with Johnson and her costar Andrew Francis. \"They're both young actors who came from the school of working from the gut and not trying to intellectualize everything.\"\n\nBefore the album's release date, Epic Records removed Johnson from their Artist Lists. Johnson later gave clarification on her website that launched August 11, 2009, saying \"Epic has released over a third of their artists from their contracts and, la dee da... I'm one of those artists...\" She also later clarified in an interview that the \"head of the label who signed [her] ended up shifting to a different company. It led a lot of artists on Epic astray.\" She confirmed that due to losing her deal with Epic, she would be releasing a different album independently with her brother Brendan producing. She said she hopes that her unreleased debut album with Epic would see the light one day, noting that for now, the songs are still tied up in the arrangement with Epic.\n\nThe independent release will be by the company which also runs her website – Laydee Spencer Music, Inc. Johnson released a list of songs that are going to be on her album in alphabetical order, and later requested fans to go through the clips of five upcoming songs on her site, and to recommend which should be the lead-off single. The tracks posted were: \"L.A. Made Me\", \"Hurricane Girl\", \"Voodoo\", \"A Little Bit\", and \"Trip Around the World\". It was announced that her debut album \"Voodoo\" would be released on March 30, 2010. The debut single, Trip Around The World, was released on February 2, 2010 along with a music video shot by Michael Maxxis. Johnson shared in an interview that her favourite songs of \"Voodoo\" are \"Look at Those Eyes\", \"Voodoo\", and \"Gonna Get It\".\n\nJohnson informed her fans through her Twitter account and her official website that all the songs from \"Voodoo\" would be remixed by the Demolition Crew due to lack of airplay. The Demolition Crew undertook to make the songs more radio-friendly. She later released her remix album \"Reloaded\", it was released on April 26, 2011. The first single, \"Boogie Love\" (The Demolition Crew Remix), was released on January 10, 2011 while the second one, \"Look at Those Eyes\" (The Demolition Crew Remix), was released on March 29, 2011.\n\nShe became a trending topic on Twitter for four days, due to the ABC Family television series \"Pretty Little Liars\", playing \"Time to Be Your 21\", a song performed by Johnson in the series \"Instant Star\", in the season finale. While trending on Twitter, she garnered attention from Demi Lovato and Nelly Furtado. Lovato has spoken several times about Johnson being her inspiration to start a career in music, while Furtado spoke about her single \"Look at Those Eyes\" calling it \"an event\". With the help of the Twitter trend, Johnson made the homepage of several online sites, including \"L.A. Times\" Ministry of Gossip Blog.\n\nJohnson created a YouTube account where she posts videos of herself performing along with her brother Brendan James Johnson, and Jimmy Robbins. On June 22, 2011, Johnson held two live concerts on Stage It for fans around the world. The concerts were performed online via webcam. Though many of her songs had already been featured in several episodes. In June, 2011 it was announced that Johnson would sing on the opening theme song of the television series \"\" Season 11. The idea came naturally as Demacio \"Demo\" Castellón was producing the track and asked her if she would contribute to it.\n\nShe revealed that she is writing for her next album and hoping to enter the studio by the end of the Summer to start recording. Johnson and her brother, Brendan Johnson, released a digital album of some of her previously unreleased demo's entitled, \"The Basement Recordings\", on August 26, 2011.

It serves students from the towns of Dover and Sherborn, and is the senior school of the Dover-Sherborn Public School District, housing grades 9 through 12. It also hosts some METCO students. It is rated by Boston Magazine as the top High School in Massachusetts \n\nUntil the 1960s Dover and Sherborn sent their high school students to neighboring towns' high schools (Needham for Dover, Framingham for Sherborn). By the 1950s, the population boom was making it difficult for those schools to accept outside students, and the two towns created a regional school district. The first building was built on Farm Street in 1962. As the population continued to increase, the current high school was built on the same campus and completed in 1968. In 2004, a $43 million renovation on the campus was completed, which included a renovation of the high school building, the razing of the middle school (the original high school building) and the new construction of the middle school. The other schools in the district are Dover Sherborn Middle School (DSMS), Pine Hill School and Chickering School. The current headmaster of Dover Sherborn High school is John Smith, accompanied by assistant headmaster Ann Dever-Keegan.\n\nAcademically, the Dover-Sherborn High School has been historically ranked as one of Massachusetts' top-performing public schools. For example, in 2015, \"Newsweek\" magazine ranked Dover-Sherborn High School as the 16th best high school in the country. In 2014, \"Boston Magazine\" rated Dover-Sherborn High School as the best public school in Greater Boston. From 2011-2019, \"Boston Magazine\" ranked the Dover-Sherborn School System as number one in Massachusetts. \"US News\" recognized this by including DSHS amongst the top 100 public high schools in America. \n\nFor the 2006–2007 school year, DSHS tenth-grade students ranked fourth in English and math among their peers on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exam. Ninety-six percent of the class of 2006 took the SAT I and 56% scored over 600 in the verbal section, 65% scored over 600 in the math section and 58% scored over 600 in the writing section. About 97% of all graduates attend college or university.\n\nThe school offers sports including American football, soccer, cross country, golf, field hockey, basketball, alpine and Nordic skiing, swimming, baseball, lacrosse, track and field, tennis, hockey and sailing. The Dover-Sherborn athletic department is headed by Jeff Parcells. Parcells took on the roll of athletic director at the beginning of the 2015 school year, succeeding former A.D Heath Rollins. Since Parcells move from Sutton High school, he has helped guide Dover Sherborn teams to multiple state and league titles across a variety of sports. Dover-Sherborn has won Tri-Valley League and Mass Bay East League titles dating back to the early 1970s, and has won ten state championships over the course of its history: 1981 boys' basketball, 2019 boys' basketball, 1982 Men's Skiing, 1992 boys' soccer, 1994 Girls' Tennis, 2009 girls' tennis, 2010 boys' soccer, 2011 Girls' Soccer, 2012 Boys' lacrosse, 2013 Boys' lacrosse, and 2015 Boys' Alpine Skiing. From 2003-2007 the boys' and girls' lacrosse teams have met with success in the Tri-Valley League, consistently placing second only to Medfield. The boys' lacrosse team as of recently though, has won two Division III state championships and three Tri Valley League titles (2011, 2012 & 2013). Anchored by the 2013 graduates, the Raiders men's lacrosse team was able to win back-to-back state championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2014 the Raiders returned to the finals, making their 7th appearance in the championship game, but were defeated by Cohasset 10-9. The defeat marked the third time in the last six years in which the Raiders had lost in the State Finals by a single goal.\n\nThe school is part of The Education Co-operative (TEC), which allows DSHS students to take part in internships with local companies and also enroll in TEC Classes.\n\nThe Chess Team became league champions in 2007. A DSHS student project officially represented MA State at the International Science and Engineering Fair hosted by Intel in 2006. In 2007, DSHS became home to a Siemens Competition Semifinalist.\n\nThe school's Drama Department puts on two productions each year: an autumn play and a spring musical. The program is supported by the local community through organizations such as Friends of the Performing Arts, The Mudge Foundation, The Dover-Sherborn Education Fund, and Len Schnabel of DesignLight. Theater productions are performed primarily at The Mudge Auditorium in the Lindquist Commons building. Some local productions are also performed at the Sherborn Community Center/1858 Town House. Productions include: \"Children of Eden\", \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\", \"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"Seussical\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"Godspell\", \"The Odd Couple\", \"Anything Goes\", \"Once Upon a Mattress\", \"The Crucible\", \"Pippin\", and \"West Side Story\".

It was released by Aware Records, a Columbia Records subsidiary, in 2000. It contains two of his most well-known songs, \"Easy Tonight\" and the Grammy-nominated \"Superman (It's Not Easy)\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 1, 2001, and Platinum on October 22, 2004. The album has sold over 966,000 copies in the United States as of November 2009.\n\nJohn Ondrasik had been active in the Los Angeles music scene since the 1980s, but did not adopt \"Five for Fighting\" as his stage name until he signed with EMI Records in 1995. His first album, \"Message for Albert\", came out through EMI in 1997 but EMI's American division closed shortly after \"Message\" came out. After EMI's collapse, Ondrasik briefly signed with Island Records, but then \"PolyGram, Island’s parent company, merged with Universal and he was lost in the shuffle.\" Ondrasik then signed with Aware and Columbia Records and began working on \"America Town\". After being dropped from two straight record companies, Ondrasik, then in his mid-30s, believed \"America Town\" would be his \"swan song.\"\n\n\"America Town\" features ten new songs and two songs that were re-recorded from the ill-fated \"Message\" album (\"Love Song\" and \"The Last Great American\").\n\nOndrasik wrote all of the songs and lyrics. Gregg Wattenburg, the album's producer, played electric guitar throughout the album and provided backing vocals. Dorian Crozier was the drummer for all songs except \"Love Song,\" which saw Robert Medici reprise the role (he had been the drummer on the \"Message for Albert\" version of the song). The bassists were Sheldon Gomberg and Mark Montague.\n\n\"America Town\" was met with mixed to positive reviews by critics. AllMusic called it \"a bright and clean effort that delivers some heavy themes,\" and noted that \"the focus is clearly on the lyrics, which are well written and effectively sung.\" Retrospective reviews of the album have been largely positive.\n\n\"Easy Tonight\" was released as the lead single. The second single, \"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" achieved mainstream success, peaking at number one on the Adult Top 40. Superman was nominated for a Grammy in 2002. Following the success of \"Superman,\" \"Easy Tonight\" was released as a single a second time, reaching number 18 on the Adult Top 40. Two more singles followed (\"America Town\" and \"Something About You\"), but neither song replicated the mainstream success of \"Superman\" and \"Easy Tonight.\" \n\nThe success of \"America Town\" meant that the album had not been Ondrasik's swan song, as he'd anticipated. His third studio album, \"The Battle for Everything\", came out in 2004 and was also certified Platinum.\n\n\"Superman\" was certified Gold by the RIAA in 2005. \n\nAll songs written by John Ondrasik.\n"}

The crossing is reached by Interstate 5 on the American side and by British Columbia Highway 99 on the Canadian side. It serves the most direct route between the major cities of Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia, and the crossing is the third-busiest on the border with up to 4,800 cars a day. Wait times can be up to four hours; traffic lights exist on the southbound lane, with timers showing when the light will turn green so drivers can turn off engines, visit the park, and use public restrooms. Between the two border stations sits the Peace Arch Park, where visitors are free to cross the border within the confines of the park.\n\nBorder inspection services at this crossing long predated the 1921 construction of the Peace Arch. The Canada border station is officially known as \"Douglas\" after the surrounding locality, although it has been known over the years as \"White Rock\" and \"Surrey\". The US border station is known as \"Blaine - Peace Arch\".\n\nThe crossing is less than a mile west of the Pacific Highway Border Crossing; trucks and other commercial vehicles have been prohibited from using the Peace Arch crossing since the 1970s, in an effort to improve the visitation experience of the park.\n\nPrior to the construction of the Peace Arch, the border region was congested with homes and businesses. The US and Canada built inspection facilities near the border in the early 1900s. The area between the ports of entry was declared a bi-national park in 1939, and the buildings were demolished. The US built a substantial brick border station in 1936, and replaced it in the early 1980s, and again in 2009. Canada built a large wooden border station in 1929, and replaced it with a concrete border station in 1952. It was expanded and modified substantially over the years until a new border station was built in 2010.\n"}
{"id": "1987383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987383", "title": "Caffeine dependence", "text": "Caffeine dependence\n\nCaffeine is a commonplace central nervous system stimulant drug which occurs in nature as part of the coffee, tea, yerba mate, cocoa and other plants. It is also an additive in many consumer products, most notably beverages advertised as energy drinks and colas.\n\nCaffeine's mechanism of action is somewhat different from that of cocaine and the substituted amphetamines; caffeine blocks adenosine receptors A and A. Adenosine is a by-product of cellular activity, and stimulation of adenosine receptors produces feelings of tiredness and the need to sleep. Caffeine's ability to block these receptors means the levels of the body's natural stimulants, dopamine and norepinephrine, continue at higher levels.\n\nThe \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" describes four caffeine-related disorders including intoxication, withdrawal, anxiety, and sleep.\n\nMild physical dependence can result from excessive caffeine intake. Caffeine addiction, or a pathological and compulsive form of use, has not been documented in humans.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that people who take in a minimum of 100 mg of caffeine per day (about the amount in one cup of coffee) can acquire a physical dependence that would trigger withdrawal symptoms that include headaches, muscle pain and stiffness, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, depressed mood, and marked irritability. Professor Roland R. Griffiths, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore strongly believes that caffeine withdrawal should be classified as a psychological disorder. His research suggested that withdrawal affects 50% of habitual coffee drinkers, beginning within 12–24 hours after cessation of caffeine intake, and peaking in 20–48 hours, lasting as long as 9 days.\n\nContinued exposure to caffeine leads the body to create more adenosine receptors in the central nervous system which makes it more sensitive to the effects of adenosine in two ways: It reduces the stimulatory effects of caffeine by increasing tolerance, and it increases the withdrawal symptoms of caffeine as the body becomes more sensitive to the effects of adenosine once caffeine intake stops. Caffeine tolerance develops very quickly. Tolerance to the sleep disruption effects of caffeine were seen after consumption of 400 mg of caffeine 3 times a day for 7 days, whereas complete tolerance was observed after consumption of 300 mg taken 3 times a day for 18 days.\n"}

A variant of the EMD MP15DC with an AC transmission, 246 examples were built, including 25 for export to Mexico, and four built in Canada.\n\nThe MP15DC’s standard Blomberg B trucks were capable of transition and road speeds up to , allowing use on road freights. Soon there was a demand for a model with an advanced AC drive system. The MP15AC replaced the MP15DC’s DC generator with an alternator producing AC power which is converted to DC for the traction motors with a silicon rectifier. The MP15AC is longer than an MP15DC, the extra space being needed for the rectifier equipment. The alternator-rectifier combination is more reliable than a generator, and this equipment became the standard for new diesel-electric locomotive designs.\n\nThe MP15AC is easily distinguished from the DC models. Instead of the front-mounted radiator intake and belt-driven fan used on all previous EMD switchers, these have intakes on the lower forward nose sides and electric fans. Side intakes allowed the unit to take in cooler air, and the electric fans improved a serious reliability issue found in its earlier DC sisters.\n\nThe MP15 used a roots-blown 12-cylinder 645E engine. The engine is rated at . The 645 series, introduced in 1966, was EMD’s standard engine through the 1980s.\nIn the early 1970s railroads were starting to convert to AC power, the six largest buyers, Milwaukee (64), Southern Pacific (58), Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (45), Nacionales de México (25), Long Island (23), and Louisville & Nashville (10), were all buying AC road locomotives. 36 more units were sold to 8 other customers.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Road units are now owned by the Soo Line Railroad (an American operating subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway); those not painted in the Canadian \"Golden Beaver\" scheme have worn a Soo Line patch job; those wearing it are often called \"Bandits\". Six former Milwaukee units returned to \"home rails\" in 2008, serving the growing regional Wisconsin & Southern Railroad WSOR in Milwaukee, Madison, and Horicon. In addition, Union Pacific has bought many examples on the used locomotive market.

The district was created when Alberta became a province, to encompass residents of the city of Edmonton on the northside of the North Saskatchewan River. For a time, it was one of three multi-member constituencies in the province's history, the others being Calgary and Medicine Hat.\n\nThree methods of electing representatives were used over the years.\n\nFirst past the post election of a single member was used in 1905 and subsequent elections and by-elections up to 1920.\n\nBlock voting (voters able to cast as many votes as there were seats, that is, 2) was used in 1909 and 1913 and with five seats in 1921.\n\nThe Edmonton constituency was divided into two single-member constituencies for the provincial election of 1917: Edmonton East and Edmonton West. The adjacent constituency of Edmonton South had been renamed from the old constituency of Strathcona.\n\nThe three Edmonton districts were merged to form the Edmonton constituency in 1921, and block voting was established in 1921, to elect five members in the constituency.\n\nAs a semblance of proportional representation, the UFA government brought in the single transferable vote for all constituencies, and made Edmonton, Calgary and Medicine Hat (for 1926 only) multi-member constituencies, with votes apportioned as per the Hare system, starting in 1924. STV, and the Hare system, where applicable, was also used in provincial by-elections during this period. Edmonton had five seats in 1926, then six seats in 1930 and 1935, then five until 1952. Edmonton had seven seats elected at-large in 1952 and 1955.\n\nIn 1959 the Social Credit government broke up the Calgary and Edmonton constituencies and replaced the transferable balloting with first-past-the-post single-member districts across the province. Eight constituencies were created in Edmonton: Edmonton Centre, Edmonton North, Edmonton Norwood, Edmonton North East, Edmonton North West, Jasper West, Strathcona Centre, Strathcona East and Strathcona West.\n\nThe first table shows at a glance, the number of seats available by general election year for the Edmonton riding. The second table shows the number of districts in Edmonton, when the Edmonton riding was broken up.\n\n\"For the 1913 election, Edmonton South Provincial electoral district was created from the old Strathcona constituency to elect one MLA. The Edmonton constituency elected two members by the block vote system.\"\n\nThis election was conducted using block voting, where each Edmonton voter could cast up to five votes. The percentages shown in the table below indicate the proportion of the voters casting votes who may have cast votes in the candidate's favour. For example, a third of the voters casting all five of their votes for the Liberals would accrue a total of 150 \"percent\" of the votes while the candidates would still only receive the support of a third of the voters. With the rest of the votes split among other parties, the Liberals with only a third of the voter support did take all the Edmonton seats in this election.\nThis was the first election in Alberta to use STV, the system just introduced for elections in Alberta's largest cities.\n\nW.T. Henry got the most votes in the first count but no candidate received a majority of them so subsequent counts were held using second choices of the lower-ranking candidates. He was elected on third count.\nCommunist Party candidate H.M. Bartholomew showed strong third place showing, almost exceeding Conservative candidate on the second count.\n\nThe sum of the candidates' vote totals below do not equal the votes cast recorded here because of the number of spoiled ballots, an unfortunate by-product of STV. 15,130 valid ballots were cast in Edmonton in this election.\n\nUnder the STV procedure used (the Hare system), the quota necessary to win a seat was 3026 (15,130 divided by 5, the number of seats being contested). Prevey and Duggan won seats without the quota in the last counts, after other candidates were dropped out.\n\nThe result was roughly proportional with two Conservatives, a Liberal, a Labour and a UFA winning seats. Not all the five leaders in the first count were elected - Independent Liberal Joe Clarke did not make quota in first count and did not pick up enough votes from other candidates' later preferences to get quota, likely due to not being in a political party. Liberal candidate J.C. Bowen was in top five in first count, but also did not get quota and despite being in a party, was not elected - many of the other Liberal party supporters' second preferences went to another Liberal candidate, Prevey, a more popular individual overall, it seems.\n\nLabour although not having anyone in top five spots in first count, did capture a seat. This was proportional - it received about 20 percent of the vote spread over five candidates. Farmilo, the leading labour candidate in the first count, was not elected though. Gibbs, who was apparently on an individual basis more popular overall than Farmilo, got quota in later counts through distribution of others' second preferences, such as Joe Clarke supporters probably.\n\nConservatives Duggan and Weaver did not get quota in first count. Weaver did later when his companion Conservative candidates were dropped out. Duggan got a seat by being one of the last ones still standing when the last counts were held.\n\nFive seats were open in this election. The Hare quota, the number of votes needed to win a seat, was 7291.\n\nThis election saw an anti-SC movement, made up of Liberals, Conservatives and some UFA-ers, get many seats. Page, Duggan and Macdonald were elected in Edmonton this election as candidates of the People's League AKA Unity Movement, recorded as Independent in results below. \nFour of that group's candidates placed in the top five spots in the first count, but this was un-proportional and the process thinned them down.\n\nSC candidate Norman James placed low in the first count but got enough votes from other candidates who were dropped out, and from Manning's surplus votes, to take a seat, pushing out O'Connor, a Unity League candidate. He did this without achieving quota but by being one of the last ones standing when the field of candidates thinned out. Due to his personal popularity, he leapfrogged over a couple SC candidates to take the seat, demonstrating that the STV-PR is about voters' preferences for individual candidates and not party lists.\n\nMany of the candidates listed as Independents, such as sitting MLA D.M. Duggan, were candidates for the Unity League, an anti-SC alliance of Conservatives and Liberals.\n\nThis by-election was run according to the Hare STV-PR in effect for Edmonton (and Calgary) at this time. Voters across Edmonton voted as the city was a single constituency at this time.\n\nThere was only one seat being contested so the system devolved to an Alternative Vote process, whereby the winner had to take a majority of the valid votes.\n\nLymburn, a former UFA cabinet minister, was running as an anti-SC Unity League candidate. He did well in the first count surpassing the vote total of the SC candidate; but both being passed by CCF-er Roper. It became a tight race between Roper and Lymburn. The winner was not named until the fourth round after three of the five candidates had been eliminated and their second preferences distributed. There is such a high number of exhausted ballots because about half of the voters who voted for the SC, Soldiers Rep and Liberal candidates did not give second preferences.\n\nBut finally when the SC candidate, the third from the bottom in the first count, was dropped off in the fourth round, the final count for the last two candidates could be established and the winner decided. It is possible that in the last round, when the SC candidate was dropped off, most of his voters' second preferences went to Roper, apparently being thought more in tune with SC's help-the-little-guy philosophy than the Conservative/Liberal-member-dominated Unity League.\n\nThis election was held under the Hare STV-PR system.\n\n1944 Hare quota was 6306 (one-fifth of the total valid ballots). Premier Manning got it in first count. His surplus votes (enough on their own to elect another candidate) were apparently spread among the other four SC candidates (or sent elsewhere or maybe his supporters did not put down a second preference) so none of the other SC candidates received enough to take a seat right off.\n\nPage, running for the anti-SC Unity League, here identified as Independent, was in top five in the first count. The League, winding down, ran only one candidate and League votes were not spread around. He took enough votes in the first count to hold on to take a seat in later counts.\n\nJohnnie Caine, a WWII ace, running as an Independent, was personally popular but did not get quota in the first count and not having a party behind him, did not receive many of the other candidates' second preferences when they were dropped off.\n\nThe first candidates to be dropped were mostly Communists and CCF candidates, whose voters it seems gave their second preferences to their own, such as Roper who took a seat, and then eventually to Norman James, of the SC party. He and William J. Williams were the last two standing when the field of candidates thinned out and they took seats even without achieving the quota.\n\nThis election was held under the Hare STV-PR system.\n\nThe 1948 Hare quota was 7692. Manning got it in first count. His surplus votes probably helped elect other two SC candidates.\n\nProwse also got quota but no other Liberal got in on his shirt-tails.\n\nElmer Roper too exceeded quota. His surplus was not distributed, perhaps because by then the count was at an end with only two candidates left standing to fill two remaining seats. Two SC-ers, Heard and Clayton, took these without achieving quota.\n\nResult was roughly proportional to the three parties that ran in this contest. (The Conservatives stayed out, supporting Page, an opponent of the SC government, running for the Independent Citizens' Association.)\n\nPremier Manning alone took almost half the votes in the first count, and his party took more than half the seats. The CCF took one sixth of the votes and one-fifth of the seats. The Liberals took about one-fifth the votes and one-fifth of the seats. Only about one-tenth of the votes were wasted - this included Page.\n\nOn a candidate basis, two of the top five in the first count were not elected. Page was not popular with enough second preferences, while Liberal Lazarowich also did not have holding power.\n\nDistrict results from the first province wide plebiscite on electricity regulation.\n\nOn October 30, 1957 a stand-alone plebiscite was held province wide in all 50 of the then current provincial electoral districts in Alberta. The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.\n\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments. Question B was slightly modified depending on which city the voters were in.\n\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Edmonton voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plebiscite. The district recorded slightly above average voter turnout almost just over the province wide 46% average with over half of eligible voters casting a ballot.\n\nEdmonton also voted on Question B2. Residents voted for mixed drinking with a super majority. Turnout for question B. Turnout for Question B was slightly lower and than Question A.\n\nOfficial district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. The Social Credit government in power at the time did not considered the results binding. However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new \"Liquor Act\".\n\nMunicipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the Plebiscite were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.\n\n"}
{"id": "1987410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987410", "title": "Wu Song", "text": "Wu Song\n\nWu Song (), also known as Wu the Second (), is a character in \"Water Margin\", one of the Four Great Classical Novels in Chinese literature. Nicknamed \"Pilgrim\", he ranks 14th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits of the 108 Stars of Destiny. In folk tales, Wu Song is a martial arts student of Zhou Tong and specialises in \"Chuojiao.\" He fights well with \"bang\" (quarterstaff) or a pair of broadswords. \nWu Song is from Qinghe County (in present-day Xingtai, Hebei). The novel depicts him as good-looking with an impressive bearing, shining eyes, thick eyebrows and a muscular body. As his parents died early, he was raised by his dwarfish elder brother Wu Dalang (武大郎; literally \"Wu the Older\"), whom he respects and loves.\n\nWu Song gets into a fight when drunk and knocks a man unconscious. Thinking that he has killed that man, he goes on the run and takes shelter in the residence of the nobleman Chai Jin. He meets Song Jiang there and they become sworn brothers.\n\nLearning later that the man he fought is not dead, Wu Song decides to go home. On the way, he passes by a tavern near Jingyang Ridge, which puts out a banner that reads \"After Three Bowls, Do Not Cross the Ridge\",() and stops there for a break. The tavern waiter explains that the inn's home-brewed wine is so strong that customers would get drunk after having three bowls and are unable to cross the ridge ahead. Still sober after three bowls, Wu Song demands for more. By the end of his meal, he has consumed 18 bowls of wine but still looks steady. He is about to leave when the waiter stops him and warns him about a fierce tiger on the ridge. Wu Song suspects that the waiter is bluffing him to spend the night at the tavern. Ignoring the waiter, he continues his journey, armed with only a quarterstaff.\n\nNear the ridge, Wu Song spots an official notice warning of a tiger ahead. Not to lose face, he could not turn back to the inn. As he moves on, the wine starts to take effect, so he takes a nap on a big rock. As he is falling asleep, the tiger leaps out from the woods, shocking him out of his stupour. After narrowly dodging the tiger‘s first three charges, Wu Song attempts to fight back but breaks his staff on a tree. Unarmed, he summons all his might and manages to pin the tiger face-down with his arms. He then rains blows on the tiger's head using his bare fist. After punching the tiger unconscious, he picks up his broken staff and whacks it till he is sure it is dead. Fearing another tiger might appear, he flees the spot. He runs into some local hunters, who are amazed to learn what he has just done. The magistrate of the nearby Yanggu County (in present-day Liaocheng, Shandong) offers him the job of chief constable. Wu Song accepts it and settles down. He runs into his brother Wu Dalang, who has moved there.\n\nAccording to some scripts in Yangzhou storytelling, particularly the \"Wang school\", Wu Song's slaying of the tiger took place \"in the middle of the tenth (lunar) month\" of the \"Xuanhe year [1119]\".\n\nWu Dalang brings Wu Song home and introduces him to his wife Pan Jinlian (). Wu Song learns that they had moved to Yanggu to avoid harassment by their neighbours in Qinghe. Wu Dalang, who sells flatbread for a living, is a dwarf taunted in Qinghe as \"Three-Inch Nail Tree Bark\" () for his short stature. The harassment got worse following his marrying Pan. He is very incompatible in looks with his young and attractive wife, who was originally a maid of a rich man and had been forced to marry Wu Dalang as punishment for resisting his advances. Pan Jinlian is attracted to her handsome and well-built brother-in-law and tries to seduce him, but he sternly rejects her.\n\nLater, Wu Song is assigned to escort some gold to the imperial capital Dongjing (present-day Kaifeng, Henan). He returns home two months later to find that his brother had died and that his body had been cremated. Wu Song does not believe his sister-in-law's account that his brother died of a sudden illness, and conducts a private investigation. He learns that Pan Jinlian is having an affair with a rich roguish local merchant Ximen Qing (), who has seduced the woman with the help of the Wus‘ neighbour teahouse owner Granny Wang (). Informed by a teenage bun seller Brother Yun (), Wu Dalang had caught Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian in bed together. But he was left injured and bedridden after being kicked hard in the abdomen by Ximen. Abetted by Granny Wang and Ximen, Pan Jinlian murdered him by poisoning his medicine. Ximen then coerced a coroner to quickly cremate the body. Wu Song finds the coroner, who relates what he knows. He has also kept some of Wu Dalang's bones as evidence of poisoning. Wu Song then goes to the county office to demand legal justice, bringing along Brother Yun and the coroner. However, the magistrate, who has been bribed by Ximen, dismisses the case citing insufficient evidence.\n\nDenied legal avenue, Wu Song takes matters into his own hands. He invites the neighbours, including Granny Wang, to a belated wake for his brother. At the wake, he forces Pan Jinlian at knife point to make a full confession on the murder, after which he decapitates and disembowels her. He then makes the frightened Granny Wang sign a confession in front of the neighbours. He next goes to Lion Restaurant (), where Ximen Qing is dining with his friends, and kills him after a fight. Wu then goes to the county office to surrender himself.\n\nThe local residents sympathise with Wu Song and plead on his behalf. Granny Wang is sentenced to death by \"lingchi\" but Wu Song is spared execution and exiled to Mengzhou. On the way Wu Song and his two escorts pass by Cross Slope (十字坡; in present-day Fan County, Henan), where they take a rest in Sun Erniang's inn. Wu Song senses the woman is up to no good and pretends to drink the wine spiked with drugs and fall unconscious. When Sun tries to lift him, he easily overpowers her. Just then, Sun's husband Zhang Qing comes back and stops the scuffle. The couple apologise and befriend Wu Song. They host him for some time before seeing him off to Mengzhou.\n\nShi En (施恩), son of the chief warden of Mengzhou prison, has heard of Wu Song's name and hopes he could help him seize back his money-making restaurant at Happy Forest (快活林). The place has been forcefully taken by one Jiang Zhong (蔣忠), a burly man expert in wrestling nicknamed \"Jiang the Door God\". The restaurant is in fact a facade for collecting protection money from local businessmen and tolls from travelers. But when Jiang came to Mengzhou, invited by his friend the local militia instructor Zhang (張團練), he beat up Shi En and seized the place. Shi, needing Wu Song‘s help, finds ways to spare him mandatory beating in prison and ensures he leads a comfortable life. Upon knowing why he is so well treated, Wu Song agrees to help Shi take back the restaurant. He says that his fighting ability is at its peak when he is drunk, so he asks to be served three bowls of wine at every tavern he passes by on his way to the Happy Forest. So by the time he reaches the restaurant he has taken an enormous amount of wine. He provokes Jiang Zhong into a fight and soundly beats him with a set of martial arts moves known as \"Jade Circle Steps and Mandarin Ducks Kicks\" (玉環步，鴛鴦腳). He then orders Jiang to apologise to Shi En, return him the restaurant, and leave Mengzhou for good.\n\nJiang Zhong then collaborates with Instructor Zhang and the local garrison inspector Zhang Mengfang () to get back at Wu Song. Inspector Zhang pretends to admire Wu Song and invites him to stay at his manor. He then frames Wu, accusing him of theft. After being beaten up and jailed for six months, Wu Song is exiled to another place. Jiang Zhong then bribes Wu‘s escorts to murder him on the way with the help of two of his students. When the group come to Flying Cloud Pool (), Wu Song breaks up his cangue and kills all the four men. He returns to Inspector Zhang's manor and finds his way to the Mandarin Ducks Tower (), where the trio — Inspector Zhang, Instructor Zhang and Jiang Zhong — are drinking as they wait for news of his death. He kills all three and the entire family of Inspector Zhang. Overall 15 are killed in Zhang's house. He then writes \"The killer is Wu Song the tiger-slayer\" with blood on a wall before leaving.\n\nAfter fleeing Mengzhou, he runs into Sun Erniang and Zhang Qing again, who advise him to go to Mount Twin Dragons to join the outlaw band there. Sun suggests that he disguise as an unshaven Buddhist pilgrim to avoid being recognised since wanted notices with his portrait are posted everywhere. Earlier on, Sun had butchered a Buddish pilgrim who left behind a Buddhist robe, a necklace of skulls, a headband and a pair of broadswords. Wu Song puts on the robe and lets down his hair, as Buddhist pilgrims do, which conceals the exile tattoo on his face. He is thus nicknamed \"Pilgrim\".\n\nOn his way, Wu Song passes by a temple where a Taoist Wang (), nicknamed \"Flying Centipede\" (), keeps a kidnapped woman for sex. Wu Song kills the priest and his servants, saves the woman, and burns down the temple. Next he comes by a tavern and has a quarrel with Kong Liang as he is not happy that the waiter has served him food less delicious than those for Kong. He defeats Kong in a fight. Later, with help from his brother Kong Ming and their servants, Kong Liang tracks down Wu Song who has got so drunk that he falls unconscious at a creek. They overpower him easily and tie him to a tree. Song Jiang, who is living at the Kongs‘ residence at the time, recognises Wu Song, and asks the brothers to release him. Wu Song reaches Mount Twin Dragons where he joins Lu Zhishen and Yang Zhi.\n\nAfter the battle of Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong) between Liangshan outlaws and government forces, Wu Song and the others from Mount Twin Dragons join Liangshan.\n\nWu Song is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He is one of the few who vehemently object to accepting amnesty from the emperor and serving the Song government. Nevertheless, he joins the Liangshan heroes on their campaigns against the invading Liao army and rebel forces on Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.\n\nIn the battle of Muzhou (睦州; in present-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang) in the campaign against the rebel leader Fang La, Wu Song fights Fang‘s sorcerer Bao Daoyi. Bao uses his magic power to control a flying sword and slice off Wu Song's left arm. Wu Song is saved by Lu Zhishen. He is one of the few Liangshan heroes who survive the campaign. Not wanting to serve the government, Wu Song refuses to go back to the imperial capital Dongjing and stays in Hangzhou to look after the stroke-stricken Lin Chong. He lives as a Buddhist recluse in Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou until he passes away at 80.\n\nThe beginning of \"Jin Ping Mei\" is roughly the same as \"Water Margin\". After his sister-in-law murdered his brother, he wanted to take revenge. At first, he tried to kill Ximen Qing, the lover of his sister-in-law, but he killed the wrong person instead. He was exiled to Mengzhou. He came back later, but Ximen Qing had already died of sickness. He then killed his sister-in-law, and fled to Mount Twin Dragons.\n\nWhile \"Jin Ping Mei\" is famous for its sexually explicit content, there is nothing sexual about Wu Song in the novel.\n\nThe following tale alternatively known as \"\"Meeting Zhou Tong By Chance\"\" and \"\"Swordplay under the Moon\"\" belongs to the \"\"Wang School Shuihu\"\" of Yangzhou storytelling. It acts as a spin-off story (), which means it takes place in the same setting as \"Water Margin\", but is independent of the main story line. The tale takes place after Wu Song kills the man-eating tiger, resists the charms of his sister-in-law and accepts a mission from the magistrate to transport money to Kaifeng, but before he becomes a bandit. It explains how he came to learn swordplay from Zhou Tong:\n\nWu Song was given orders to travel on assignment to Kaifeng after becoming a constable in Yanggu County. When he arrived in Kaifeng, Wu Song took his introduction letter to the \"yamen\" and retired to an inn to await his summons. The following day, he left his inn to explore the bustling city.\n\nKaifeng was one of the largest cities in China at that time and it was full of various kinds of shops and heavy traffic from people coming in and leaving the city. As Wu Song walked along enjoying the organised chaos, the sky changed colour and it became a torrential downpour. It rained so much that waves flowed across the ground and mist rose around the houses. The rain hurt the top of his head so he huddled under the roof of a small shop along with several other people vying for safety. However, as soon as it started, the rain suddenly stopped.\n\nWu Song continued on his way when he came to the Tianhan Bridge. It was arched, so people had to use steps to ascend to the top. When he stepped onto the bridge, Wu Song lifted up his clothing and looked down at his feet so he could avoid the huge puddles of water left from the freak rain shower. Unbeknownst to him, he was walking directly towards an elderly man who was descending the stairs right above him. Wu Song continued to walk up the bridge without looking in front of him. This old man was Zhou Tong and he was in a hurry. When Zhou Tong saw Wu Song approaching him on the bridge without watching in front of him, he took Wu Song to be another martial arts master who wished to tarnish his reputation by throwing him off the bridge with a shoulder strike. Zhou Tong prepared for a counterattack and began to swallow air with a subtle \"Hm!\" and directed his energy to his right shoulder, which turned red then purple and became as hard as rock underneath his clothing. When the two men brushed shoulders, despite being a master of Iron Shirt and Drunken Eight Immortals boxing, Wu Song was nearly knocked off the bridge and the pain caused saliva to pour from his mouth. The attack left him weak in the knees and one side of his body was completely numb. He thought after all of his years of martial arts practice his body was nearly invincible, but he had met his superior in Zhou Tong. Instead of cursing and reprimanding the old man, Wu Song held his tongue, which greatly impressed Zhou Tong. In lieu of a kind word, Zhou Tong simply bowed in apology and went on his way since he was in a rush.\n\nAfter Zhou Tong disappeared into the bustling crowd, Wu Song rubbed his shoulder and returned to his inn. He ate his lunch and supper in turn, but felt it was too early to go to bed. He went outside into a quiet courtyard behind the inn to do a little shadowboxing underneath the starry night sky. He untied his belt and wrenched it to the left and right until it was very tight and tied it into a knot. He then focused his energy and began to practise his Drunken Eight Immortals boxing. Before he was even half way done with his routine, the loud screams of another person's martial arts practice interrupted his concentration. He grabbed a bench to steady himself on and looked over the top of a brick wall that opened into the hall of a large mansion to the east of the inn.\n\nIn the middle of the hall sat three tables laden with all the myriad kinds of food. However, the stately-looking people attending this sumptuous feast were underneath the eaves of the hall watching a person practise his swordplay in the manor's courtyard. This person was Zhou Tong and he had his beard tied into a knot so he would not accidentally cut it off with his double swords. Zhou wielded his swords to and fro and did it so fast that the flashes of light cast from the blades made it look like his entire body was wrapped in snow. Even if a person threw a bowlful of ink at him, not a single drop of it would tarnish his clothing. Wu Song became mesmerised by Zhou Tong's display of superior swordsmanship. When he twirled around and ended up facing in his direction, Wu Song recognised Zhou Tong as the old man he had bumped into on the bridge earlier in the day. He realised that Zhou Tong must be a great master adept in the art of the \"deep breath\" technique.\nDuring his practice, Zhou Tong let out a mountain-crumbling scream and fell onto his back while kicking one leg into the air. Wu Song felt sorry for Zhou Tong because he thought maybe the man was too old to practise the martial arts and had lost his balance. However, Zhou Tong screamed once more and this time he shot high into the sky with his swords pointed upward towards the moon. After watching him land and perform a few punches and kicks, it finally dawned on Wu Song that Zhou Tong was indeed practising the boxing routines of the immortals Iron-Crutch Li and Han Xiang from the Drunken Eight Immortals style. Zhou Tong was so good at this style that his performance once caused a fellow warrior to become intoxicated. Puzzled, Wu Song remembered back to his own martial arts master who had told him there were only two people in the world (including Wu Song and his master) who could perform such boxing. Zhou Tong also knew the style too. Because Zhou Tong's performance was so great, Wu Song went against the rules of etiquette and shouted praise from the top of the wall.\n\nThis shouting interrupted Zhou Tong before he could finish the forms for the rest of the Eight Immortals. He spun around and asked his aristocratic audience who it was that was shouting praise of his performance. They were unable to answer because their snobbery prevented them from noticing anything outside of their own amusement. However, one of their level-headed servants heard the noise and pointed towards the brick wall. Zhou Tong used his magical X-ray eyes to peer through the brick wall and into Wu Song's bone structure to see he was a special person indeed. When Wu Song praised Zhou Tong's performance, he formed an instant friendship with the old man. Zhou Tong invited Wu Song over the wall to partake in the festivities.\n\nWhen Zhou Tong asked for his name, he was delighted to learn Wu Song was the same fellow who became famous for killing a man-eating tiger with his bare hands on Jingyang Ridge in Shandong in the previous year. When Wu Song learnt who Zhou Tong was, he immediately dropped to his knees, kowtowed and pleaded to become his apprentice. Wu Song was thrilled to meet this \"master of the older generation\", who was famous throughout the \"jianghu\" for his skill in military and civilian martial arts. Zhou Tong helped Wu Song up and began to teach him swordplay under the moon.\n\nNotable actors who have portrayed Wu Song in film and television include: Ti Lung, in \"The Water Margin\" (1972), \"Delightful Forest\" (1972) and \"Tiger Killer\" (1982); Zhu Yanping, in \"Outlaws of the Marsh\" (1983); Ding Haifeng, in \"The Water Margin\" (1998); Chen Long, in \"All Men Are Brothers\" (2011).\n\nThe Hong Kong comic \"Old Master Q\" also has a special edition animated cartoon with \"Water Margin\" characters, with the primary focus being on Wu Song. However, this version is extensively modified and presents a skewed version of Wu Song and the original story.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1987418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987418", "title": "Bunny Ahearne", "text": "Bunny Ahearne\n\nJohn Francis \"Bunny\" Ahearne (19 November 1900 – 11 April 1985) was an international ice hockey administrator and business executive. He served rotating terms as president and vice-president of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) from 1951 to 1975, and was the secretary of the British Ice Hockey Association from 1934 to 1971, and later its president until 1982. He began in hockey by managing the last Great Britain team to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympic Games, before moving to the international stage. He implemented business reforms at the IIHF, oversaw the growth of ice hockey to new countries, and expanded the Ice Hockey World Championships. He was inducted into both the Hockey Hall of Fame and the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame during his lifetime and was posthumously inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.\n\nAhearne was secretary of the British Ice Hockey Association (BIHA) from 1934 to 1971, and served as the association's president from 1971 to 1982. During this time he was also the United Kingdom's delegate to meetings of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). During this time he hired Pat Marsh as his secretary, who later took over as the BIHA secretary when Ahearne became president.\n\nAhearne was the head coach of the Great Britain ice hockey team which won a bronze medal at the 1935 Ice Hockey World Championships. He continued working on the business management of the team for another three years, and appointed Percy Nicklin to take over the coaching duties. \n\nPrior to Ahearne's involvement in the national team, it was composed of current and former army officers. He decreed that the national team needed to play at least four British-born players, and augmented the roster with imports. He built a powerful British team by recruiting players living in Canada who obtained British citizenship under the British nationality law, through ancestral linkages to the United Kingdom. Ahearne went to Canada in 1935 with team captain Carl Erhardt to find the best available players. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) reluctantly agreed to allow permission for any player wishing to transfer, as long as the BIHA would only use such players who were properly transferred.\n\nThe combined efforts of Ahearne, Nicklin and Erhardt, went on to win an Olympic gold medal and two silver medals for Great Britain in the next three years. The team earned the gold medal in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics hosted in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which also determined the 1936 European Championship and the 1936 World Championship. Great Britain later won silver at both the 1937 Ice Hockey World Championships and the 1938 Ice Hockey World Championships, and won the European championship both times.\n\nAhearne was part of the IIHF delegation who travelled to North American in 1947, to convince the CAHA, and the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) to resume being active members. He later welcomed the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation to IIHF membership in 1952. He served as vice-president of the IIHF from 1951 to 1957, then as president from 1957 to 1960, then as vice-president again from 1960 to 1963, returned to the presidency from 1963 to 1966, returned to vice-presidency from 1966 to 1969, and then president again from 1969 to 1975. The alternating terms as president and vice-president arose from the agreement where the CAHA and AHAUS rejoined the IIHF with the promise of rotating the top position between Europe and North America. The other IIHF presidents during that time were Robert Lebel from Canada (1960 to 1963), and William Thayer Tutt from the United States (1966 to 1969).\nDuring his time with the IIHF, Ahearne is credited with improving its finances, cooperating with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and helping to develop and introduce hockey to new countries. He also transformed the Ice Hockey World Championships into a well-known annual tournament, and implemented the splitting of the event into different tiers of competition. He also oversaw the foundation of both the IIHF European Junior Championships and the Izvestia Cup in 1967. He introduced advertisements on the side boards of hockey rinks during the World Championships, and secured broadcasting rights for international matches. He is also credited for redistributing funds and profit sharing from these events to IIHF members for development. \n\nIn 1969, the IIHF voted to allow limited use of former professional players at international competitions. The decision was later challenged by the Soviet Union, claiming that Canada would abuse the change at the upcoming 1970 World Ice Hockey Championships. When the IOC did not support the change, Ahearne was caught in the middle and later changed his position. The CAHA responded by withdrawing from international play until 1977. This dispute led to the negotiation of the 1972 Summit Series, of which Ahearne was one of the four signatories who approved the event on 18 April 1972, along with Fred Page, Joe Kryczka, and Andrey Starovoytov. He retired as IIHF president in 1975, and was replaced by Günther Sabetzki.\n\nAhearne received Ontario Hockey Association Gold Stick Award in 1948, and the AHAUS citation award in 1949. He was named an honorary president of the IIHF in 1975. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1977, the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987, and posthumously inducted into IIHF Hall of Fame in 1997. He was the namesake of the Ahearne Cup that began in 1952 in Sweden, from the combined efforts of Djurgårdens IF Hockey and the \"Dagens Nyheter\" newspaper.\n\nAhearne was born on 19 November 1900 in County Wexford, Ireland. He spent the majority of his life residing in England working as a travel agent, and never played ice hockey. Ahearne died on 11 April 1985, at his home in England due to heart failure. Gord Renwick attended the funeral on behalf of Canada, and said that despite their disagreements, Ahearne was respected by Canadian officials for his business sense.\n"}

The film features an ensemble cast that includes Mohanlal, Shankar, Menaka, M. G. Soman, Nedumudi Venu, C. I. Paul, Sukumari, Jagathy Sreekumar, Kuthiravattam Pappu, Sreenivasan and Baiju Santhosh.\n\nPoochakkoru Mookkuthi marks the directorial debut of Priyadarshan, the first collaboration of Priyadarshan and Mohanlal as director and actor. Their frequent collaborator M. G. Sreekumar made his Malayalam debut as a playback singer through the film.\n\nThe film was released on 17 March 1984 by Dinny Films. It was a commercial success at the box office. \"Poochakkoru Mookkuthi\" is regarded as one of the landmark films in Malayalam cinema. The success of the film triggered a deluge of screwball comedy films in Malayalam cinema in mid-1980s. Poochakkoru Mookkuthi was remade in four Indian languages.\n\nRevathi (Menaka) comes to the city from a small town in search of a job and to have a good life and as it is with everyone, her problem starts with finding a house. Shyam (Shankar) wants to become a singer. His parents are against his wish to become a singer. So he runs away from home and needs a shelter. Revathi accidentally meets Shyam, who too is in search of a house through the common milk-boy, Chikku (Baiju). Chikku offers them both a house to rent if they are ready to pose as husband and wife in front of the landlord.\n\nSupran (Poojappura Ravi), a miserly moneylender who doesn't trust his much younger wife Kousalya (Thodupuzha Vasanthi) is their landlord. Revathi in search of a job, meets Ravunni Menon (Nedumudi Venu), a rich man who owns a bungalow in the heart of the city. Ravunni Menon stays with his wife whose name too is Revathi (Sukumari).\n\nGopalakrishnan (Mohanlal) needs some investment to come up in business and life. But to get started, he ends up having to rob his stingy father (Sankaradi) of money that the latter had hidden away out of sight of tax authorities. He is in search of a rich woman he can marry. Accidentally, Revathi meets Gopalakrishnan who has come to Ravunni Menon's house to repair the electronic equipment, which he had sold to him.\n\nGopalakrishnan thinks that Revathi is Ravunni Menon's daughter and her beauty enchants him. Revathi comes to know that there is a job in Gopalakrishnan's showroom and manages to get a job with him by playing along with his mistaken belief that she is Ravunni Menon's daughter. She is aided in this subterfuge by the fact that she shares the same name as Ravunni Menon's wife and all of his business interests are named after \"Revathi\".\n\nAfter office hours, Gopalakrishnan drops Revathi outside Ravunni Menon's house, thinking it to be her house. She always enters the bungalow through the front gate and skips out through the gate itself after hiding in the garden until Gopalakrishnan drives away. Ravunni Menon's wife, Revathi, sees her coming and going out of the bungalow and starts suspecting her husband of an affair.\n\nGopalakrishnan frequently visits the bungalow to visit Revathi, who is never there, and Ravunni Menon thinks his wife is having an affair with Gopalakrishnan. Further her encounter with \"Thenga\" Govindan Pillai (C. I. Paul) makes the older Revathi believe that her husband has sons and daughters out of wedlock and, thus, is quite capable of another affair now.\n\nShyam in the meantime begins falling in love with Revathi and to make her jealous, he pretends that he is attracted to Kousalya, who in turn thinks this to be true and is ready to elope with him after robbing her miser husband.\n\n\nThe film was distributed by Dinny Films, it was a commercial success and ran for more than 100 days in the theatres. \"Poochakkoru Mookkuthi\" is regarded as one of the landmark films in Malayalam cinema.

Based in Toronto, Ontario, Speakeasy published monthly comics, creator-owned independent series, original graphic novels, and collected out-of-print creator-owned comics series that had originated with other companies. Its best-known titles were \"Atomika\", \"Beowulf\", \"The Grimoire\", and \"Rocketo\".\n\nAlthough Speakeasy made a big public relation splash and announced a large lineup of monthly titles, it had trouble almost from the beginning in following through with its plans. Warren Ellis characterized the short-lived company as \"one publisher getting it wrong from start to finish: releasing too many books, without a support structure, releasing comics without a dedicated marketing plan.\"\n\nAdam Fortier founded Speakeasy Comics In August 2004. (Previously, Fortier had worked for comics publishers Dreamwave Productions — where he revived the Transformers licence in comics — Devil's Due Publishing, UDON, and IDW Publishing.)\n\nIn March 2005, the company published its first titles, the debut issues of \"Atomika\" and \"The Grimoire\".\n\nIn a sign of trouble to come, however, that same month, Yoshitaka Amano's \"Hero\", a highly anticipated graphic novel, was cancelled and postponed one year. It was resolicited in February 2006 for tentative publication in April 2006, but cancelled again in May 2006. (It is now being published by Boom! Studios.) In October 2005, creator Frank Espinosa announced the moving of his \"Rocketo\" series to Image Comics.\n\nIn November 2005, Speakeasy announced it had concluded a financing deal with Los Angeles-based Ardustry Entertainment: Speakeasy would now also develop comics based on licenses brought by Ardustry, while Ardustry would represent Speakeasy's comics properties in the entertainment industry (movies, videogames, etc.)\n\nAlso in November 2005, Speakeasy-owned titles \"Beowulf\", \"The Grimoire\" and \"Spellgame\" went through several creative team changes. In that same period, only a few months after signing with the publisher, \"Atomika\" creator Sal Abbinanti split from Speakeasy to self-publish future issues \"Atomika\". under his own Mercury Comics label.\n\nIn December 2005, Speakeasy canceled orders on two months' of previously ordered comics. Creator allegations of non-payment and mismanagement of projects started circulating.\n\nSpeakeasy published no titles in January 2006. That month, creator Sal Cipriano announced he had cancelled his \"Bio Boy\" series, but was keeping \"The Hill\" there. Creator Matt Maxwell announced he had amicably parted with Speakeasy for his \"Strangeways\" series. Four issues had been solicited but never published.\n\nAlso in January, Chimaera Studios announced they were moving their eight series — \"Mutation\", \"Of Bitter Souls\", \"Super Crazy TNT Blast\" [renamed \"Twilight Men\"], \"Smoke & Mirror\", \"Lonebow\", \"Wargod\", \"Project Eon\", and \"Silent Ghost\" — from Speakeasy to the British publisher Markosia. Creators Jose Torres and Chris Dibari announced they were also moving their series \"The Hunger\" to Markosia.\n\nIn addition, Jonathan Martin's Speakeasy Comics Archive (a blog dedicated to Speakeasy-related news) was shut down, presumably under \"trademark infringement\" litigation.\n\nIn February 2006, creators of the series \"O.C.T. - the Occult Crimes Taskforce\" announced their move to Image Comics.\n\nOn February 27, 2006, Vito Delsante, Speakeasy's \"unofficial\" public relations director, announced via email the immediate closure of Speakeasy, with all March-solicited books still shipping, April and May's being tentative, and June's being cancelled. The company, however, didn't file for bankruptcy, officially in order to try to pay its outstanding bills.\n\nComics reporter Tom Spurgeon charactered the company's demise this way: \"... right now you have to have sustainable capital, publishing skill, marketing ability, something some people want, and enough perspective to let those factors and not personal ambition define the enterprise. I didn't see any of that with Speakeasy...\"\n\nIt was later revealed (according to Ardustry Entertainment's business affairs manager, Wayne Williams) that the November 2005 deal between Speakeasy and Ardustry had only been an option to buy Speakeasy, which expired without materialization. Cash-flow problems led to Speakeasy's demise before they could materialize various lucrative licensing deals, such as with HBO (\"The Sopranos\" and \"Deadwood\").\n\nSpeakeasy intended to collect some series in trade paperbacks (such as \"Atomika\", \"Grimoire\", and \"Beowulf\"), but all solicited TPBs were eventually cancelled. In March 2006, only \"Beowulf #7\" was published. In May 2006, Diamond Comic Distributors's monthly list of cancelled comics listed all the remaining unpublished Speakeasy comics, with the terminal cancel code 10 (\"Supplier Out of Business\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on pre-order sales through Diamond Comic Distributors reported by industry resource site ICv2, Speakeasy's top-selling monthly comics during its period of operation were:\n\n\n"}

He was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He was the executive vice-president of the Philadelphia Flyers, a position he held from 1980 for the rest of his life.\n\nAllen played junior hockey for the Saskatoon Quakers in 1940–41, and then joined the Washington Eagles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League for the 1941–42 season, followed by a year with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. During the Second World War, he played on the Saskatoon Navy hockey team, and then played the 1945–46 season in the Western Canada Senior Hockey League with the Saskatoon Elks.\n\nIn 1946, Allen joined the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League, for whom he played the next five seasons. The Indians moved to Syracuse in 1951, becoming the Warriors, and he was a steady presence in the line-up for the next two and a half seasons. In February 1954, Warriors owner Eddie Shore tried to assign Allen to the Springfield Indians of the Quebec Hockey League, but he (along with several other players) balked and he was suspended. He was sold to the Detroit Red Wings two weeks later. He played 10 games with Detroit in the 1953–54 season and appeared in the playoffs, getting his name engraved on the Stanley Cup. Allen played another 18 games for the Red Wings in 1954–55, which would be the end of his NHL playing career.\n\nHe spent most of the 1954–55 season in the Western Hockey League with the Edmonton Flyers—Detroit's farm team, whose roster included future Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Johnny Bucyk, Norm Ullman, Glenn Hall, Al Arbour, and player-coach Bud Poile. He then played one season with the Brandon Regals before being hired by the Seattle Americans as player-head coach in 1956. He retired as a player in 1957 to become a full-time coach.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1965, Allen was a head coach in the Western Hockey League with the Seattle Americans/Seattle Totems, with only one losing season in eight years. With the NHL expansion in 1967, Allen was hired as the first head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers, with his former coach and teammate Bud Poile as general manager. In their inaugural season, the Flyers finished first in their division with the best record among the six new teams. They fell to third place in their division in the 1968–69 NHL season, and Allen then became the Flyers' general manager while serving in the same capacity with the Quebec Aces at the same time. There, he would help construct the famed \"Broad Street Bullies\" that led the Flyers to consecutive Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. He would also help start the AHL's Maine Mariners, one of the most successful franchises in that league's history.\n\nAllen was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a Builder in 1992. He was the executive vice-president of the Flyers.\n\nKeith Allen was married to Joyce Webster for 65 years. Together they have a daughter, Traci, and two sons, Brad and Blake. Relocating from Seattle in the 1960s, he and his wife Joyce settled in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\n\nDue to developing dementia in his later years, Allen lived in the care of an assisted living community, along with wife Joyce, in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania.

He grew up under poor circumstances in Vienna, but because he received excellent grades in primary and secondary school he was later admitted as an officer candidate in the Austrian army in 1934. In his years as a cadet, he met his wife Christl Kukula, the daughter of a Jewish Vienniese industrialist. After the Anschluss in 1938, he had to end his relationship with Kukula because of the Nuremberg laws that forbade romantic involvement with Jews. Despite this, he secretly stayed in contact with her during the next years and married her, after the war, in 1946. Together they had one son.\n\nBecause of his relationship to a half-Jewish woman (\"Halbjüdin\" as the Nuremberg laws put it), he was transferred from an élite panzer unit to the ordinary infantry regiment and fought in the first phases of World War II in Nazi Germany's assaults on Poland and France. Because he was wounded in battle, he was sent back to Vienna for work in the administration of the district of Vienna.\n\nIn 1943, then-captain Szokoll was introduced in Berlin to colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, one of the heads of the resistance movement in the Third Reich, by the Austrian lieutenant colonel Robert Bernardis and got involved with them by monthly visits of Robert Bernardis in Vienna since February 1944. When the 20 July plot seemed to have succeeded after Stauffenberg placed a bomb in the Führer Headquarters \"Wolfsschanze\", he was with Colonel Heinrich Kodre, the \"Chief of Staff\" in Vienna, one of the resistance's man of Stauffenberg, who executed with Colonel Kodre the orders to seize all authorities and arrest the leading members of SS and the Nazi administration.\n\nColonel Kodre and captain Szokoll, unlike their co-conspirators in Berlin, succeeded in rounding up nearly all Nazi officials in Vienna. When the plot leaders realized that Hitler had survived, Stauffenberg called Szokoll on a secure line in order to tell him that the attempt had failed. Although Szokoll was one of the last conspirators who had telephone contact with Stauffenberg, he was able to convince the Gestapo that he was only following orders and thus he escaped punishment as one of only a handful of conspirators who did.\n\nBeing promoted major later in 1944, he tried to take all measures within his power to save Vienna from following the fate of so many other European cities before that had been destroyed in heavy fighting. In the first months of 1945, he got involved with the Austrian resistance movement and started to create a network of officers in order to contact the nearing Soviet Army and declare Vienna an open city. The plan was working well until early April 1945. Although Hitler had ordered the Wehrmacht to fight until the last man in the defence of Vienna, Szokoll's co-conspirators had implemented a plan that would order all troops to retreat from Vienna when the Soviets were close to the city. However, the conspiracy was discovered and Nazi officials immediately hanged the leading conspirators and searched for Szokoll. Once again, he managed to escape and, in the following days, took part in Operation Radetzky, the plan of the Austrian resistance to take over Vienna and prevent fighting as far as possible. Ultimately, the city only saw moderate fighting and the inner districts saw practically no fighting. Szokoll had acted as the provisory administrator of Vienna from the time the Wehrmacht had retreated, but was once again nearly taken prisoner by the Soviets when being accused of working for US intelligence.\n\nHonoured by the reinstated Austrian government for his merits on freeing Austria from the Nazis, he started a career as author and film producer. Among his work is the script for the film \"Der Bockerer\", the production of \"Die letzte Brücke\" (the film that made Maria Schell famous), and his own autobiography that became a bestseller. He died in Vienna in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The album reached No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" Top Internet Albums chart and No. 40 on \"Billboard\"'s Heatseekers.\n\nEach song is described by the band in detail within the liner notes. Bassist Tony Levin almost exclusively used a Chapman Stick to record the album's bass parts. The only bass guitar parts on the album occur briefly in \"Another Dimension\" and the intro to \"Biaxident\". The latter song takes its name from Biaxin, a medication that guitarist John Petrucci was taking during the recording sessions to combat severe headaches, making a pun on \"by accident\".\n\nIn the middle of the recording sessions, which took place between October and November 1998, Petrucci had to leave the studio when he got word that his pregnant wife had gone into labor. This left the other three band members to carry on recording by themselves. This is how \"When the Water Breaks\" got its name, as it was the song the band were working on when Petrucci got the news. The song contains a baby sound effect (a \"baby soundscape\", as described by keyboardist Jordan Rudess) at 12:48 to mark the particular section the band had been writing upon Petrucci's departure.\n\nIn Petrucci's absence Levin, Rudess and drummer Mike Portnoy recorded dozens of completely improvised jams, many of which would eventually be released on the 2007 album \"Spontaneous Combustion\" under the group name Liquid Trio Experiment. As such, \"914\" is the only song on the album which did not feature Petrucci. Portnoy alluded to the jams in the liner notes, stating that \"if you dig this, there is A LOT more where it came from...\"\n\nWhen Petrucci returned to the studio in November, he wrote and recorded guitar parts for two of these improvisations: \"Chewbacca\" and \"Liquid Dreams\". For \"Chewbacca\" in particular, he took the time to learn several of Rudess's improvised melodies and doubled them on guitar, which in Portnoy's words \"(gave) the illusion of written composition\".\n\n\"Hourglass\" is a duet between Petrucci and Rudess in the style of \"State of Grace\" from the band's first album. According to Petrucci it was written and recorded \"in the wee hours with old strings\".\n\n\"Acid Rain\", the album's opening track, was the last song to be written and recorded by the whole band. For this song Petrucci used a seven-string guitar. A live version later appeared on Dream Theater's 2001 album \"Live Scenes from New York\". In this version the bass part is played by John Myung of Dream Theater on a six-string bass.\n\n\n"}

His chairmanship came at the same time as his family increased its stake in the company to 24.9%, just short of the 25% threshold above which they would be required by law to make an offer to buy out all other shareholders. This marked a step forward in his fight with Malaysian billionaire investor Quek Leng Chan for control of YHS and its land holdings in Singapore's Bukit Timah district, which could be worth billions of dollars were they redeveloped into residential real estate. In the end, Ng and his father were able to successfully take advantage of squabbles within the Yeo family to buy up 86% of YHS' stock. Their battle to gain control of the company was later described as \"one of the most colourful take-over struggles in Singapore's history\" and led to YHS' transformation from a food company to a luxury real estate developer.\n\n"}

This allowed the club entry into the Semi-Professional Football League (SPFL) after only one season in existence. During the beginning years of the club's existence, Joe Public had established an operative football office with paid staff and employed several players from countries throughout the Caribbean, Nicaragua, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nThe club finished second in their first season of the SPFL in 1997, and in 1998 they won the Champions' League Tournament, the Craven A SPFL League title, and the CFU Caribbean Club Championship.\n\nHowever, in 2004, Joe Public withdrew from the Professional Football League to play in the National Super League, Trinidad and Tobago's second division, but returned after two years for the 2006 season, in which they clinched the league championship title.\n\nIn November 2007, as a result going undefeated through the group stage of the CFU Club Championship 2007, Joe Public advanced to the knockout rounds after decisive wins over Sagicor South East United from Dominica 5–0, and SV Racing Club Aruba 7–0. In the quarterfinals they defeated Bassa F.C. from Antigua and Barbuda 4–0 and then in the semifinals, Joe Public upended the Puerto Rico Islanders 1–0 to advance to the final. On 16 November, Joe Public fell to Harbour View of Jamaica 1–2 to finish runner-up. However, due to the reorganized CONCACAF Champions' Cup into the CONCACAF Champions League, Joe Public qualified for the Champions League in August 2008.\n\nOn 26 August 2008, Joe Public faced the New England Revolution, from the United States in the first leg of the Preliminary Round in the CONCACAF Champions League 2008–09. The \"Eastern Lions\" defeated New England Revolution 2–1 in front of a crowd of 2,100 at the Marvin Lee Stadium. Then, on the return leg before 3,523 spectators in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Public used a hat trick from Gregory Richardson in routing New England Revolution 4–0 in Gillette Stadium to advance to the group stage on a 6–1 aggregate score. With the result, Joe Public became the first Caribbean club to defeat a team from the United States in a CONCACAF club competition. In addition, Public were also the first to score as many as three goals against a club from the United States.\n\nIn the group stage, Joe Public were drawn with Atlante, Olimpia, and Montreal Impact. On 17 September 2008, Joe Public did not start the group stage on a positive note, falling 2–0 to Montreal Impact in Montreal. The \"Eastern Lions\" home opener for the CONCACAF Champions League did not go well either, as Joe Public lost 3–1 to C.D. Olimpia in the Marvin Lee Stadium giving the club no points from its first two games in the group stage. However, in their third game, Joe Public traveled to Cancun, Mexico and defeated Atlante 1–0. On 8 October, Joe Public lost another game in the group stage. This time they fell to Montreal Impact again 4–1, slashing the chances of Joe Public advancing beyond the group stage. With the loss to Atlante 2–0 in Cancún, Mexico on 21 October, Public was officially eliminated from the CONCACAF Champions League 2008–09. Finally, to finish the group stage, Public travelled to Tegucigalpa, Honduras to face Olimpia. They lost the match 4–0 to end their run in the CONCACAF Champions League with a record of 3–0–5 in the competition, with a disappointing 1–0–5 record in the group stage to finish at the bottom of their group.\n\nOnly two days after a loss to Montreal Impact in the CONCACAF Champions League, Joe Public needed a goal from Gregory Richardson in the 47th minute to defeat San Juan Jabloteh 1–0. With the win Joe Public advanced to the final of the First Citizens Cup. However, in the final, W Connection won a thrilling match, which saw Joe Public level the score 2–2 in the second half following a goal from Keyeno Thomas. But Public eventually lost the game on penalty kicks 6–5.\n\nIn 2011, Joe Public withdraw from TT proleague due to issues arising from owner Jack warner \nIn 2014, the club withdrew from Super League due to financial reasons \n\nJoe Public plays their home games at the Marvin Lee Stadium located at the Dr. João Havelange Centre of Excellence in Tunapuna. The stadium serves as a multi-use stadium which has a capacity of approximately 6,000. The stadium was named after the national U-20 football captain, a standout defender at the time, who sustained head and neck injuries suffered in a collision with Landon Donovan in an U-20 game against the United States. He was left paralysed after the incident and died of illness as a result of his weakened state. Lee was later recognised by the Trinidad and Tobago government for his service to the nation and is remembered as a strong-willed individual who refused to let his injuries get the better of him.\n\nIn 2005, CONCACAF and CFU president Jack Warner proposed that Marvin Lee Stadium install an artificial playing surface, citing that it would bring more credibility for the region. Two years later, through a developmental grant from FIFA, Joe Public became the first Caribbean club to install an artificial playing surface, reportedly costing in excess of TT$8 million (US$600,000). The first game played on the newly installed playing surface, Joe Public faced Caledonia AIA in a TT Professional Football League match, which saw Caledonia AIA win a hard fought game 1–0 over the \"Eastern Lions\".\n\n\nDomestic\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitational\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1987448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987448", "title": "Al Arbour", "text": "Al Arbour\n\nAlger Joseph Arbour (November 1, 1932 – August 28, 2015) was a Canadian ice hockey player, coach, and executive. He is third to Joel Quenneville for games coached in National Hockey League history and fifth all-time in wins, behind Scotty Bowman, Joel Quenneville, Ken Hitchcock and Barry Trotz. Under Arbour, the New York Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983. Born in Sudbury, Ontario, Arbour played amateur hockey as a defenceman with the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League. He played his first professional games with the Detroit Red Wings in 1953. Claimed by the Chicago Black Hawks in 1958, Arbour would help the team win a championship in 1961. Arbour played with the Toronto Maple Leafs for the next five years, winning another Cup in 1962. He was selected by the St. Louis Blues in their 1967 expansion draft and played his final four seasons with the team.\n\nDuring his last year with the Blues, Arbour was hired mid-season to coach the team. In 107 games, he led them to a 42–40–25 record, but only one playoff series win. After a woeful expansion year, the New York Islanders hired Arbour as coach in 1973. Arbour led the team to a winning record every season from 1974–75 until he stepped down in 1985–86. Arbour won nineteen consecutive playoff series, which remains an NHL and North American sports record. He was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach in 1979. Upon retiring from the bench, Arbour was named vice-president of player development for the Islanders. He returned to coach the Islanders in the 1988–89 season and remained there through 1993-94, notably upsetting the two-time defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1993 playoffs. He was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for his contributions to the sport and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nArbour started his playing career in 1954 with the Detroit Red Wings. He later skated for the Chicago Black Hawks, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues. Arbour won the Stanley Cup as a player with the 1960–61 Chicago Black Hawks and the 1961–62 and 1963–64 Toronto Maple Leafs. Arbour, along with teammate Ed Litzenberger, is one of eleven players to win consecutive Stanley Cups with two different teams. He is one of only 11 players in Stanley Cup history to win the Cup with three or more different teams. Arbour was also the first captain of the expansion St. Louis Blues, and played for them when they lost in Cup finals in 1968, 1969, 1970 (all in four consecutive games). One of the few professional athletes to wear eyeglasses when competing, Arbour was the last NHL player to wear them on the ice. Arbour was also known for laying down in front of the goaltender to block shots on goal with his body.\n\nArbour began his coaching career with the Iowa Hawkeyes hockey teamin 1967 and at the time lead them in his first year to ther best record at .500 then he went to the NHL in St. Louis in 1970, taking over as coach after playing for the Blues for parts of four seasons. Following two additional seasons with St. Louis, he was recruited by GM Bill Torrey to take over a young New York Islanders team that had set a then-NHL record for futility by winning only 12 games in their inaugural season, 1972–73.\n\nIn his first season as Isles' coach, Arbour's team finished last in the league for the second year in a row, but gave up 100 fewer goals and earned 56 points, up from 30 the year before. New York Rangers defenceman Brad Park said after the Islanders beat their crosstown rivals for the first time, \"They have a system. They look like a hockey team.\"\n\nThe 1974–75 Islanders finished third in their division with 88 points, which qualified them for the playoffs, where they defeated the Rangers in overtime of the deciding third game of their first-round series. In the next round, the Isles found themselves down three games to none in a best of seven quarter-final series against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Islanders rebounded with three straight victories to tie the series, then prevailed in Game 7 by a score of 1–0. It was only the second time in major sports history, and the first since 1942, that a team won a series after trailing 3–0. The Islanders then faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the next round, again fell behind 3–0, and once again tied the series, although the Flyers prevailed in Game 7 and went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\n\nDespite achieving great regular season success, culminating in the 1978–79 campaign in which they finished with the best record in the NHL, the Islanders suffered a series of letdowns in the playoffs. In both 1976 and 1977, they lost in the semi-finals to the eventual champion Montreal Canadiens, and then suffered an upset loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1978 quarter-finals, on a game-winning goal by Lanny McDonald in overtime of Game 7. Then, in 1979, the rival Rangers defeated Arbour's Islanders in the semi-finals 4–2. Arbour won the Jack Adams Award for the team's stellar regular season.\n\nDuring the 1979–80 season, the Islanders struggled. However, following the acquisition of Butch Goring in March, the Islanders completed the regular season with a 12-game unbeaten streak. The regular season run carried over to the playoffs and the Islanders captured their first Stanley Cup championship on May 24, 1980, by defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in overtime of Game 6.\n\nArbour and the Islanders went on to capture 3 more Cups in a row, a record for an American hockey club. Along the way, they set records for consecutive regular season victories, consecutive Finals victories, and playoff series victories. By the time the Islanders were dethroned by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1984 Stanley Cup Finals, they had strung together 19 straight playoff series victories, a professional sports record. No team in any of the four major sports has strung together four consecutive championships since. The closest a team in any of the major four North American professional sports has come was when the New York Yankees (MLB), who were one out away from their fourth consecutive World Series championship, fell in the seventh game of the series to the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.\n\nArbour retired from coaching following the 1985–86 season and accepted a position in the Islanders front office as vice-president of player development.\n\nFollowing a disappointing start to the 1988–89 season, Torrey fired Terry Simpson, and Arbour returned to the bench. Most of the veterans of the dynasty had since left the team, and the Islanders missed the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Arbour had one more run deep into the playoffs in 1992–93, where he led the Islanders past the two-time defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins and to the Prince of Wales Conference Finals. Islanders star Pierre Turgeon, who was seriously injured after Dale Hunter hit him from behind in the previous round, missed all but a few shifts of the second-round series against Pittsburgh. The Mario Lemieux-led Penguins had finished first in the regular season. Arbour's Islanders defeated Pittsburgh in overtime of the seventh game of the series. In the semifinals, the Islanders lost to the eventual champion Montreal Canadiens.\n\nArbour retired after the 1993–94 season, having led the Islanders to a second playoff berth where they were swept in the first round by the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers, who went on to capture the Stanley Cup. At that time Arbour had won 739 games as an Islander coach, and a banner with that number was raised to the rafters at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on January 25, 1997.\n\nOn November 3, 2007, Arbour returned, at the request of Islanders coach Ted Nolan, to coach his 1,500th game for the Islanders. At age 75, he became the oldest man ever to coach a National Hockey League game. The Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3–2, giving Arbour his 740th win. The 739-win banner was brought down, and replaced with one with the number 1500, representing the total number of games coached. He is the only coach in NHL history to coach 1,500 games for the same team.\n\nArbour and his wife, Claire, lived in Longboat Key, Florida, and maintained a summer cottage in Sudbury. The couple had four children together. In 2015, he underwent treatment for Parkinson's disease and dementia in Sarasota, Florida, eventually entering hospice care. Arbour died on August 28, 2015, in Sarasota, Florida, aged 82.\n\n"}

{"id": "1987490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987490", "title": "Shaft mining", "text": "Shaft mining\n\nShaft mining or shaft sinking is excavating a vertical or near-vertical tunnel from the top down, where there is initially no access to the bottom.\n\nShallow shafts, typically sunk for civil engineering projects differ greatly in execution method from deep shafts, typically sunk for mining projects. When the top of the excavation is the ground surface, it is referred to as a shaft; when the top of the excavation is underground, it is called a winze or a sub-shaft. Small shafts may be excavated upwards from within an existing mine as long as there is access at the bottom, in which case they are called Raises. A shaft may be either vertical or inclined (between 45 and 90 degrees to the horizontal), although most modern mine shafts are vertical. If access exists at the bottom of the proposed shaft and ground conditions allow then raise boring may be used to excavate the shaft from the bottom up, such shafts are called \"borehole shafts\". Shaft sinking is one of the most difficult of all development methods: restricted space, gravity, groundwater and specialized procedures make the task quite formidable.\n\nHistorically mine shaft sinking has been among the most dangerous of all the mining occupations and the preserve of mining contractors called sinkers. Today shaft sinking contractors are concentrated in Canada, Germany and South Africa.\n\nThe most visible feature of a mine shaft is the headframe (or winding tower, poppet head or pit head) which stands above the shaft. Depending on the type of hoist used, the top of the headframe will either house a hoist motor or a sheave wheel (with the hoist motor mounted on the ground).\nThe headframe will also contain bins for storing ore being transferred to the processing facility.\n\nAt ground level beneath and around the headframe is the Shaft Collar (also called the Bank or Deck), which provides the foundation necessary to support the weight of the headframe and provides a means for men, materials and services to enter and exit the shaft. Collars are usually massive reinforced concrete structures with more than one level. If the shaft is used for mine ventilation, a plenum space or casing is incorporated into the collar to ensure the proper flow of air into and out of the mine.\n\nBeneath the Collar the part of the shaft which continues into the ground is called the Shaft Barrel.\n\nAt locations where the Shaft Barrel meets horizontal workings there is a Shaft Station which allows men, materials and services to enter and exit the shaft. From the station tunnels (drifts, galleries or levels) extend towards the ore body, sometimes for many kilometers. The lowest Shaft Station is most often the point where rock leaves the mine levels and is transferred to the shaft, if so a Loading Pocket is excavated on one side of the shaft at this location to allow transfer facilities to be built.\n\nBeneath the lowest Shaft Station the shaft continues on for some distance, this area is referred to as the Shaft Bottom. A tunnel called a Ramp typically connects the bottom of the shaft with the rest of the mine, this Ramp often contains the mine's water handling facility, called the Sump, as water will naturally flow to the lowest point in the mine.\n\nShafts may be sunk by conventional drill and blast or mechanised means. The industry is gradually attempting to shift further towards shaft boring but a reliable method to do so has yet to be developed.\n\nThe shaft lining performs several functions; it is first and foremost a safety feature preventing loose or unstable rock from falling into the shaft, then a place for shaft sets to bolt into, and lastly a smooth surface to minimise resistance to airflow for ventilation.\n\nIn North and South America, smaller shafts are designed to be rectangular with timber supports. Larger shafts are round and are concrete lined.\n\nFinal choice of shaft lining is dependent on the geology of the rock which the shaft passes through, some shafts have several liners sections as required \nWhere shafts are sunk in very competent rock there may be no requirement for lining at all, or just the installation of welded mesh and rock bolts. The material of choice for shaft lining is mass concrete which is poured behind Shaft Forms in Lifts of 6m as the shaft advances (gets deeper).\n\nShotcrete, fibrecrete, brick, cast iron tubing, precast concrete segments have all been used at one time or another. Additionally, the use of materials like Bitumen and even squash balls have been required by specific circumstances. In extreme circumstances, particularly when sinking through Halite, composite liners consisting of two or more materials may be required.\n\nThe shaft liner does not reach right to the bottom of the shaft during sinking, but lags behind by a fixed distance. This distance is determined by the methodology of excavation and the design thickness of the permanent liner. To ensure the safety of persons working on the shaft bottom temporary ground support is installed, usually consisting of welded mesh and rock bolts. The installation of the temporary ground support (called \"bolting\") is among the most physically challenging parts of the shaft sinking cycle as bolts must be installed using pneumatic powered rock drills.\n\nFor this reason, and to minimise the number of persons on the shaft bottom a number of projects have successfully switched to shotcrete for this temporary lining. Research and development in this area is focusing on the robotic application of shotcrete and the commercialisation of thin sprayed polymer liners.\n\nWhere the shaft is to be used for hoisting it is frequently split into multiple compartments by Shaft Sets, these may be made of either timber or steel. Vertical members in a shaft set are called Guides, horizontal members are called Buntons. For steel shaft guides, the main two options are hollow structural sections and top hat sections . Top hat sections offer a number of advantages over hollow structural sections including simpler installation, improved corrosion resistance and increased stiffness. Mine conveyances run on the guides in a similar way to how a steel roller coaster runs on its rails, both having wheels which keep them securely in place.\n\nSome shafts do not use guide beams but instead utilize steel wire rope (called Guide ropes) kept in tension by massive weights at shaft bottom called cheese weights (because of their resemblance to a truckle or wheel of cheese) as these are easier to maintain and replace.\n\nThe largest compartment is typically used for the mine cage, a conveyance used for moving workers and supplies below the surface, which is suspended from the hoist on steel wire rope. It functions in a similar manner to an elevator. Cages may be single-, double-, or rarely triple-deck, always having multiple redundant safety systems in case of unexpected failure.\n\nThe second compartment is used for one or more skips, used to hoist ore to the surface. Smaller mining operations use a skip mounted underneath the cage, rather than a separate device, while some large mines have separate shafts for the cage and skips. The third compartment is used for an emergency exit; it may house an auxiliary cage or a system of ladders. An additional compartment houses mine services such as high voltage cables and pipes for transfer of water, compressed air or diesel fuel.\n\nA second reason to divide the shaft is for ventilation. One or more of the compartments discussed above may be used for air intake, while others may be used for exhaust. Where this is the case a steel wall called a Brattice is installed between the two compartments to separate the air flow. At many mines there are one or more complete additional separate \"Auxiliary\" shafts with separate head gear and cages. It is safer to have an alternate route to exit the mine as any problem in one shaft may affect all the compartments. For this reason single shaft mines were made illegal in 1862 in the United Kingdom following the Hartley Colliery disaster where the single shaft became blocked.\n\n"}

She was the adoptive mother of six children in the 1960s and 1970s, and brutally abused them all, killing one of them, 3-year-old Dennis Jurgens, in 1965.\n\nJurgens was one of 16 children. Her brother, Jerome Zerwas, was the police lieutenant of the town of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, where she lived at the time. There was testimony from other officers that he impeded the investigation into the child's death. No prosecution was taken at that time.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Dennis' birth mother, Jerry Sherwood, looked for Dennis, only to find out he died in 1965. After seeing newspaper reports about the death, she was convinced that he had been beaten to death and demanded the case be re-opened. In 1987, Jurgens was convicted of third-degree murder of Dennis. She was sentenced to a maximum of 25 years in prison and was paroled in 1995. The case is described in detail in Barry Siegel's true-crime novel, \"A Death in White Bear Lake\". There was a television movie broadcast in 1992 on NBC entitled \"A Child Lost Forever\" that told the story from the perspective of Jerry Sherwood (played by Beverly D'Angelo). In 2005, playwright Brian Vinero wrote a theatre piece, \"The Jurgens File\", which was developed at New York City's 78th Street Theatre Lab; it told the story from the perspective of the community.\n\nOn January 13, 2000, she was initially suspected of poisoning her husband, Harold. However, he was in failing health and his autopsy results did not indicate poisoning. There was also talk years earlier of her having started the fire at her in-laws' home which killed her mother-in-law, with whom she never got along.\n\nLois Jurgens served eight years of her sentence and had a quiet life as a widow in Stillwater, Minnesota. She died aged 87 on May 7, 2013. She is buried at the Union Cemetery, in Maplewood, Ramsey County, Minnesota.\n\n"}
{"id": "1987502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987502", "title": "Battle of Noryang", "text": "Battle of Noryang\n\nThe Battle of Noryang, the last major battle of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), was fought between the Japanese navy and the combined fleets of the Joseon Kingdom and the Ming dynasty. It took place in the early morning of 16 December (19 November in the Lunar calendar) 1598 and ended past dawn.\n\nThe allied force of about 150 Joseon and Ming Chinese ships, led by admirals Yi Sun-sin and Chen Lin, attacked and either destroyed or captured more than half of the 500 Japanese ships commanded by Shimazu Yoshihiro, who was attempting to link-up with Konishi Yukinaga. The battered survivors of Shimazu's fleet limped back to Pusan and a few days later, left for Japan. At the height of the battle, Yi was hit by a bullet from an arquebus and died shortly thereafter.\n\nDue to setbacks in land and sea battles, the Japanese armies had been driven back to their network of fortresses, or \"wajō\" (和城), on the southeastern Korean coast. However, the \"wajō\" could not hold the entire Japanese army, so, in June 1598, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the Taikō who instigated the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), and also the acting Japanese Lord of War, ordered 70,000 troops mostly from the Japanese Army of the Right to withdraw to the archipelago. On 18 September 1598, Hideyoshi unexpectedly died at Fushimi castle. The Japanese forces in Korea were ordered to withdraw back to Japan by the new governing Council of Five Elders. Due to the presence of Joseon and Ming ships, the Japanese garrisons in the \"wajō\" could not retreat and stayed in the relative safety of their forts.\n\nThe Sunch'on \"wajō\" was the westernmost Japanese fortress and contained 14,000 troops commanded by Konishi Yukinaga, who was the leader of Japan's vanguard contingent during the first invasion, in 1592. Yi and Lin blocked Konishi from retreat, but Konishi sent many gifts to Chen in an attempt to bribe the Ming commander into lifting the blockade. At first, Chen agreed to withdraw the allied fleet, but Yi steadfastly refused to comply. Then Lin suggested that the allied fleet attack smaller, more vulnerable \"wajō\", such as the fort at Namhae. Yi rejected that strategy as well. Yi argued that Konishi, who commanded one of the largest \"wajō\", would be allowed to escape if the allies were to leave and fight elsewhere.\n\nOn 15 December, about 20,000 Japanese troops from the \"wajō\" of Sach'on, Goseong and Namhae boarded 500 ships and began to mass east of the Noryang Strait in an attempt to break the allied blockade of Sunch'on. The overall commander of this relief force was Shimazu Yoshihiro, the leader of the Sach'on \"wajō\".\n\nThe objective of the allied fleet was to prevent the link-up of Shimazu's fleet with the fleet of Konishi, then attack and defeat Shimazu's fleet. The objective of Shimazu's fleet was to cross Noryang Strait, link up with Konishi and retreat to Pusan. Shimazu knew that Konishi was trying to cause disunity within the Joseon-Ming alliance and hoped that they would be busy elsewhere or still blockading the Sunch'on \"wajō\" and thus vulnerable to an attack from their rear.\n\nOn 15 December, a huge Japanese fleet was amassed in Sach'on Bay, on the east end of the Noryang Strait. Shimazu was not sure whether the allied fleet was continuing the blockade of Konishi's \"wajō\", on its way to attack an abandoned \"wajō\" further east or blocking their way on the western end of Noryang Strait. Yi, meanwhile, knew exactly where Shimazu was after receiving reports from scouts and local fishermen.\n\nThe Joseon fleet consisted of 82 \"panokseon\" multi-decked oared ships. The Ming fleet consisted of six large war junks (true battle vessels most likely used as flagships) that were driven by both oars and sails, 57 lighter war ships driven by oars alone (most likely transports converted for battle use), and two \"panokseon\" provided by Yi. In terms of manpower, the allied fleet had 8,000 sailors and marines under Yi, 5,000 Ming men of the Guangdong Squadron and 2,600 Ming marines who fought aboard Korean ships, a total of almost 16,000 sailors and fighting men. The Ming fleet was divided into two squadrons, the larger of which was commanded by Lin and the smaller by Deng Zilong. The allied fleet was well equipped with cannon, mortars, archers and arquebusiers. The Japanese had 500 ships, but a significant part of their fleet consisted of light transports. The Japanese ships were well armed with arquebuses and also had some captured Joseon cannon. The allied fleet was outnumbered, but made up for it with ships which, on average, had superior firepower and heavier, more sturdy construction.\n\nThe allied fleet waited for Shimazu on the west end of Noryang Strait. The battle began around 02:00 am on 16 December. It was, from the very beginning, a desperate affair with the Japanese determined to fight through the allied fleet and the allies equally determined to keep them from breaking through and advancing.\n\nAs in Yi's previous battles, the Japanese were unable to respond effectively as the Korean and Chinese cannon prevented them from moving. The narrowness of the Noryang Strait also prevented any maneuverability.\n\nWhen the Japanese fleet was significantly damaged, Lin ordered his fleet to engage in melee combat. This, however, allowed the Japanese to use their arquebuses and fight using their traditional fighting style of boarding enemy ships. When Chen's flagship was attacked, Yi had to order his fleet to engage in hand-to-hand combat as well.\n\nSong Hui-rip, the captain of Yi's flagship, was struck in the helmet by an arquebus ball and fell unconscious for a time. The vessels got so close that Joseon ships were able to throw burning wood onto the decks of Japanese ships.\n\nHeavy Japanese arquebus fire forced the Chinese sailors to keep their heads low, while the Japanese closed in. Several parties boarded Lin's flagship and in the hand-to-hand fighting that ensued, Chen's son was injured parrying a sword thrust directed at his father. Seeing Chen's ship in trouble, the Ming left wing commander Deng Zilong and two hundred of his personal guard transferred to a Joseon \"panokseon\" (one of two given to the Ming fleet by Yi) and rowed to his aid. Several Ming ships, mistaking the \"panokseon\" for a Japanese ship, opened fire and disabled it. The stricken \"panokseon\" drifted towards the Japanese and they boarded and killed everyone on board, including Deng.\n\nBy the middle of the battle, as dawn was about to break, the allied fleet had the upper hand and half of Shimazu's fleet were either sunk or captured. It was said that Yoshihiro's flagship was sunk and that he was clinging to a piece of wood in the icy water. Japanese ships came to his rescue, pulling him to safety. During the course of the battle, the ships fought from the west end of the strait all the way across to the east end, almost to the open water. The Japanese sustained heavy damage and began to retreat along the south coast of Namhae Island, towards Pusan.\n\nAs the Japanese retreated, Yi ordered a vigorous pursuit. During this time a stray arquebus bullet from an enemy ship struck him near the armpit, on his left side. Sensing that the wound was fatal, the admiral uttered, \"We are about to win the war – keep beating the war drums. Do not announce my death.\" and with those words he died.\n\nOnly three people witnessed Sun-sin's death including Yi Hoe, his eldest son, Song Hui-rip, and Yi Wan, his nephew. They struggled to regain their composure and carried Sun-sin's body into his cabin before others could notice. For the remainder of the battle, Wan wore his uncle's armor and continued to beat the war drum to let the rest of the fleet know that the Admiral's flagship was still in the fight.\n\nChen's ship was again in trouble and Yi's flagship rowed to his rescue. Yi's flagship fought off and sank several Japanese ships and Lin called for Yi to thank him for coming to his aid. However, Chen was met by Wan who announced that his uncle was dead. It is said that Chen himself was so shocked that he fell to the ground three times, beating his chest and crying. News of Yi's death spread quickly throughout the allied fleet.\n\nOut of 500 Japanese ships under Shimazu's command, an estimated 200 were able to make it back to Pusan Harbor (other Joseon archives record that Shimazu's remnants were fiercely pursued by Yi Sun-sin's fleet: only 50 ships of Shimazu's armada ever managed to escape). Konishi Yukinaga left his fortress on 16 December and his men were able to retreat by sailing through the southern end of Namhae Island, bypassing both the Noryang Strait and the battle. Although he knew the battle was raging, he made no effort to help Shimazu. This led to the loss of crucial supply lines that caused the inevitable loss of all Japanese strongholds in Korea. Konishi, Shimazu, Katō Kiyomasa and other Japanese generals of the Left Army congregated in Pusan and withdrew to Japan on 21 December. The last ships sailed to Japan on 24 December, bringing an end to seven years of war.\n\nYi Sun-sin's body was brought back to his home town in Asan to be buried next to his father, Yi Chong (in accordance with Korean tradition). The court gave him the posthumous rank of minister of the right. Shrines, both official and unofficial, were constructed in his honor. In 1643, Yi was given the title of \"chungmugong\", \"duke/lord of loyal valor\".\n\nLin gave a eulogy while attending Yi's funeral. He then withdrew his forces to Ming China and received high military honors.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1987514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987514", "title": "Wind Power Production Incentive", "text": "Wind Power Production Incentive\n\nThe Wind Power Production Incentive, or WPPI, was a program of the Canadian Government that promoted the generation of electricity from wind power in Canada to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas that would otherwise enter the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.\n\nDuring the five-year field trial projects were performed to test the performance based on various weather conditions. Provision of economic incentives were guaranteed for up to 1,000 MW of new installed capacity by 2007. New installations in 2003 included the MacBride Wind Farm (75.9 MW) in Alberta, the North Cape Wind Farm Expansion (5.3 MW), and the Aeolous Wind Turbine (3 MW) in PEI, the Parc éolien du Renard (2.25 MW) in Quebec, the Cypress Hill Wind Farm Expansion (4.6 MW) in Saskatchewan, and the Ontario Place Wind turbine (0.75 MW) in Ontario. The government paid about half the excess cost of producing electricity from wind, compared to conventional sources, for the first 10 years of a project. The Canadian WPPI Program started in 2002 and ended on March 31, 2007 after a change of government. A different program partly replaced it.\n\nA wind farm costs about the same to build per watt of nameplate capacity as a coal-fired power station of similar rating, but the economies of scale are fewer for a wind farm due to the lower quantity of power produced over the life of a station. Depending on location, wind farms may produce nearly full power output only about 28% of the time, whereas a base-loaded coal-fired station runs at full output more than 85% of the time. The WPPI provided a direct subsidy per kilowatthour of wind energy produced, from 1.2 cents down to 0.8 cents depending on the startup date of a project. Measures were taken to distribute the incentive across the country. The total estimated cost of the program was (CDN) $260 million. The program lived a short 5 year life.\n\nThe Canadian government launched the Wind Power Production Incentive in 2002, with the intention of boosting Canada's installed wind capacity by 500% over the course of five years. The program lasted fifteen years and cost Canada 260 million dollars (170 million U.S. dollars), and it was expected to earn roughly 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (1 billion U.S. dollars) of capital investments across the country.\n\nAn internal audit in 2006 observed that capacity factors were overestimated by applicants, so less capacity was actually supplied than intended.\n\nIn 2002, Canada upheld the Kyoto Protocol, a nationwide pledge to help maintain and reduce greenhouse gas based on the theory that society has caused global warming. Canada set goals to increase in renewable resources for energy diversification, further the development of technology in all aspects, create new jobs and increase the amount of trade internationally. Canada is supported by provincial and federal governments because of their increased development of incentive programs such as, arctic energy alliances, gas distribution and a variety of business programs. The Wind Energy Research and Development (WERD) program is the study of kinetic energy transformed into electricity. As a part of National Resources Canada, this program is Canada's main resource for technical support.\n\nThe Wind Power Production Incentive lost its funding in 2006, five years into its planned 15-year lifespan. It was ultimately replaced the following year in part by a newer, more forward thinking program, ecoEnergy for Renewable Power. The Wind Power Production Incentive was created as an immediate response to Canada's upholding of the Kyoto Protocol. It was one of two programs formed to address the motives of the Kyoto Protocol along with the Renewable Energy Deployment Initiative (REDI), which focused on smaller-scale production and renewable heat. During the life of these programs, their shortcomings began to surface. These shortcomings were the product of government officials reacting too hastily to newly evidenced environmental concerns resulting from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.\n\nThrough further research and testing, the concept of relying solely on wind power for Canada's energy needs proved to be inefficient and impractical. The superseding program, ecoEnergy for Renewable Power, uses government funding and tax incentives to encourage the production of various renewable energy sources such as low-impact hydro, biomass, photovoltaic and geothermal energy in addition to the wind power Canada was already heavily invested in. The more diversified approach limits the risks involved with becoming too heavily dependent on a single energy source. These risks include increased cost and unexpected decrease in production of a particular energy source which could cause an energy crisis. EcoEnergy for Renewable Power is part of a larger program called the ecoACTION Clean Air Agenda, which planned to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions 17% from 2005 to 2020.\n\nThe Wind Power Production Incentive program was not a complete failure, but merely a premature and under-informed attempt at a large issue. The economics of the program proved quite prolific. Government funding was rewarded with substantial increases in wind power production amounting to 924 MW of clean wind energy. Much of this blueprint created by the WPPI was carried over into the new program with updated logistics. \"The ecoEnergy for Renewable Power program will provide an incentive of one cent per kilowatt hour for up to 10 years to eligible projects constructed over the next four years that generate clean electricity from renewable sources\" (Brown), a 0.2 cent per kilowatt hour decrease from the initial WPPI incentive. While also being expanded to include incentives for the production of more renewable energy sources, ecoEnergy retained the long-term incentives to provide security for those who participated in the program. The Renewable Energy Deployment Initiative was similarly supplanted by ecoENERGY for Renewable Heat, which \"will provide $36 million over four years to increase the adoption of clean renewable thermal technologies for water heating and space heating and cooling\" (Brown).\n\nThe Wind Power Production Incentive changed the way government officials, energy production companies, and consumers think about clean energy. It jump-started the industry and laid the blueprint for future clean energy acceleration programs in Canada and across the world. Wind energy's share of Canada's total energy consumption has grown at an average rate of 40% annually. Although wind power still accounts for less than 1% of Canada's total energy consumption, the programs the WPPI laid the path for have helped renewable energy sources take on about 11.1 percent of Canada's total energy consumption.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1987519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987519", "title": "History of Khuzestan Province", "text": "History of Khuzestan Province\n\nThe history of Khuzestan Province, a province in southwestern Iran, extends from the ancient pre-Aryan Elamite civilization to the modern day Islamic Republic.\n\nKhuzestan was once inhabited by a people known as the Elamites, who spoke neither Indo-European languages (like the Medes and Persians of the Iranian plateau) nor Semitic languages (like the peoples of the Mesopotamian city-states). The Elamite language was not related to any Iranian languages, but may have been part of a larger group known as Elamo-Dravidian. Archaeologists and historians have documented various Elamite dynasties ranging from approximately 2700 BCE to 644 BCE. However, various early proto-Elamite ruins such as Sialk exist in central Iran. The boundaries of Elam shifted throughout history, but Elam usually included present-day Khuzestan and areas of the Iranian plateau now part of the Iranian province of Fars. Elamite kings sometimes ruled as far afield as Babylon; sometimes they were completely subjugated by the Babylonians and Assyrians, and vice versa, as was the case for numerous dynasties that ruled Iran.\n\nHistorians differ as to whether the Elamites could be considered \"Iranian\". On the one hand, the Elamites spoke a non-Iranian language and were culturally closer to the established civilizations of Sumer and Akkad than they were to the tribes of the Iranian plateau. On the other hand, the Elamites linked the old civilizations of Mesopotamia and the new peoples of the plateau, and their version of Mesopotamian civilization was a formative influence on the first indisputably Persian empire of the Achaemenids. Elam was one of the first conquests of the new Persian empire; Elamite scribes kept the Persians' records, writing them down in Elamite cuneiform. Hence one contemporary historian, Elton Daniel, states that the Elamites are \"the founders of the first Iranian empire in the geographic sense\". (\"The History of Iran\", 2001, p. 26). If the Elamites are considered proto-Persians, then Khuzestan would have been one of the cradles of Persian civilization. Many experts such as Sir Percy Sykes in fact called the Elamites \"the earliest civilization of Persia\" (\"A History of Persia\", p38), and Ibn Nadeem in his book \"al-Fehrest\" (\"الفهرست\"), mentions that all the Median and Persian lands of antiquity spoke one language. In his book, which is the most accredited account of spoken languages of Iran during the early Islamic era, Ibn Nadeem quotes the 8th century scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa as having counted \"Khuzi\" among the Iranian languages and for having identified it as the unofficial language of the royalty of Iran.\n\nIn 644 BCE, the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal conquered Elam and destroyed their capital at Susa. For a time, the area was ruled from northern Mesopotamia. The area then seems to have re-established its independence. It was known as Susiana and ruled from Susa. It managed to remain independent of the burgeoning Median Empire.\n\n\nOver the succeeding two centuries, Persian civilization established itself in Khuzestan, though the Elamite language is said to have survived for another thousand years, until the 5th century CE.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the early years of the reign of Shapur II (309-379), Arabs crossed the Persian Gulf from Bahrain to \"Ardashir-Khora\" of Fars and raided the interior. In retaliation, Shapur II led an expedition through Bahrain, defeated the combined forces of the Arab tribes of \"Taghleb\", \"Bakr bin Wael\", and \"Abd Al-Qays\" and advanced temporarily into \"Yamama\" in central Najd. The Sassanids resettled these tribes in Kerman and Ahvaz. Arabs named Shapur II, as \n\"Shabur Dhul-aktāf\" (\"he who owns shoulders\" because either he pierced or dislocated captured Arabs shoulders or he had wide shoulders) after this battle. \"(p. 202, \"Encyclopædia Iranica\"). \n\nIt should be pointed out that the Arab presence in Iran, did not begin with the Arab conquest of the Sassanid Empire. Mutual infiltration into and out of Iran, began before the Muslim conquests and continued as a result \nof joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (\"ahl al-madar\") as well as the desert Arabs (\"ahl al-wabar\"). There were tribesmen of \"Bakr bin Wael\" and \"Tamim(Thamim)\" in Khuzestan and Fars prior to the arrival of the Arab Muslim Armies. Some of these Arab groups were sedentary while others were nomadic. Some fought on behalf of the Sassanid Empire (Taghleb, Eyad), while others (Lakhmid, Shayban, Bakr bin Wael) began struggling against the Sassanids. These latter group had already won a celebrated, if limited, victory at \"Du Qar\" around 604 CE\n\nSome local Arabs led by \"Al-Motanna bin Hareta Al-Shaybani\" helped to direct the attention of the nascent Muslim state toward Iran by converting to Islam and negotiating with Medina for support in their \nanti-Sassanid moves. (p. 210-211 \"Encyclopædia Iranica\" ).\n\n\nFor several centuries, Khuzestan was part of the province of Mesopotamia and ruled by distant caliphs. Over time, most of the inhabitants adopted Islam. The Persian language absorbed thousands of Arabic loanwords and some Arabic syntax. The Persians in their turn had a deep influence on their Arab conquerors.\n\nKhuzestan was a rich part of a thriving empire. The Karun river was dammed, and sugar-cane plantations spread over reclaimed scrublands or marshlands. Many noted Muslim scholars, scientists, artists, poets, and musicians were Khuzestanis.\n\n\nThe political situation was extremely fluid and the boundaries of the various emirates and sultanates tended to disappear quickly.\n\nIn the Umayyad period, large tribes of nomads from the \"Hanifa\", \"Tamim\", and \"Abd al-Qays\" tribes crossed the Persian Gulf and occupied some of the richest Basran territories around Ahvaz and in Fars during the second Islamic civil war in 661-665/680-684 (Encyclopædia Iranica, p. 215, under \"Arab Tribes of Iran\").\n\nDuring the Abbassid period, in the second half of the 10th century, the \"Assad\" tribe, taking advantage of quarrels under the Buwayhids, penetrated into Khuzestan, where the \"Tamim\" tribe had been inhabiting since pre-Islamic times. However, following the fall of the Abbassid dynasty, the flow of Arab immigrants into Persia gradually diminished, but it nonetheless continued.\n\nFrom 1219 to 1335, Mongols under Genghis Khan and then his grandson Hulegu invaded from the steppes to the east of the Iranian plateau, reaching Palestine before they were stopped. Baghdad, the rich and fabled capital of the Abbasid caliphs, fell in 1258. The Middle Eastern Mongol Ilkhanate sustained itself for a century and then disintegrated. Much of Khuzestan was destroyed and left in ruins.\n\nIn 1393 Khuzestan was conquered by Tamerlane and afterwards seems to have been ruled by his successors, the Timurids. As the Timurid rule decayed, Khuzestan was taken over by the Msha'sha'iya, a Shi'a millenarian sect who dominated the western region of the province from the middle of the 15th century to the 19th century. According to most sources, their descendants were still to be found in the 19th century, as powerful local rulers in the city of Hoveizeh, their original center.\n\nIn 1510 Khuzestan was conquered by the Safavid dynasty. The western part of Khuzestan was called \"Arabistan\" from this point on, due to the increasing Arab population. The eastern part of Khuzestan was known as \"Khuzestan\" and was mostly inhabited by Lurs people thus sometimes incorporated into Greater Lur. It was often contested between the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire, which held the neighboring town of Basra on the other side of the Shatt al-Arab river in modern-day Iraq.\n\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, the \"Bani Kaab\", from Kuwait, settled in Khuzestan. (see J.R. Perry, \"The Banu Ka'b: An Amphibious Brigand State in Khuzestan\", \"Le Monde\" Iranien et L'Islam I, 1971, p133) And during the succeeding centuries, many more Arab tribes moved from southern Iraq to the western part of Khuzestan. \n\nFor several centuries Khuzestan, as with many other Iranian provinces prior to the era of the Pahlavi dynasty, had been a semi-autonomous part of Persia under the control of an Imperial Governor-Generalate appointed by the Shah. The Zagros mountains separated the province from the central Iranian plateau. The governor-general, who resided part of the year in the cool highlands at Shushtar or Dezful, often left real exercise of power to local leaders who bid and quarrelled amongst each other for the position of tax farmer.\n\nOf these factions, the \"Muhaisin\" clan, led by Sheikh Jabir al-Kaabi, became the strongest and under his leadership the Bani Kaab were reunified under a single authority, the capital of the tribe being moved from the village of Fallahiyah to the flourishing port city of Mohammerah. Unlike previous leaders of the Bani Kaab, Jabir maintained law and order, and established Mohammerah as a free port and sheikhdom, of which he was Sheikh. Jabir also became the Imperial-appointed governor-general of the province.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, Russia and Britain contended for control of Persia. Both attempted to influence or intimidate the Qajar Shahs. Russia dominated the northern parts of Iran while Britain dominated the south. Khuzestan was an area of particular interest to Britain, originally because of its strategic location, and later due its vast oilfields. For more than a century, Britain was a dominant influence in the area.\n\n\n\nRampant corruption, oppressive secret police, and autocratic rule made the Pahlavi shah less and less popular. His attempts to modernize Iran and break the power of the Shi'a clergy antagonized religious leaders and devout Iranians. In 1979, a loose alliance of students, parties from both the left and the right, and Shi'a Islamists forced the Shah from power. The Shi'a clergy eventually seize power and establish the theocratic Islamic Republic.\n\nFollowing the revolution there were several regional uprisings. Khuzestan was hit by a wave of unrest led by Arabs demanding both autonomy and an end to discrimination. The uprising was suppressed by Iranian security forces, with more than a hundred dead on both sides.\n\nDisruption in the central government made various Iranian regional separatists bolder. In 1980, six Khuzestani Arab separatists temporarily seized the Iranian embassy in London (\"see Iranian Embassy Siege\").\n\nSaddam Hussein, the Iraqi dictator, supported the separatists. Initially it emerged they wanted autonomy for Khuzestan. Later they demanded the release of 91 of their comrades held in Ayatollah Khomeini's jails. Only after the incident was over did it emerge that Iraq had trained and armed the gunmen to embarrass Iran, and it would become a prelude to the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nSoon after the embassy drama in 1980, Iraqi troops invaded Khuzestan. They expected that the Arab inhabitants would welcome them as liberators, and that the Iranian army would be too weak to resist them. Both expectations were delusory. After initial gains, the Iraqis were repulsed and pushed back to the old borders. The war ended in 1988.\n\nKhuzestan was devastated by the war. What used to be Iran's largest refinery at Abadan was destroyed, never to fully recover. Many of the famous palm plantations were annihilated, cities were destroyed, and historical sites were demolished. Many of the inhabitants were forced to flee into neighboring provinces, which struggled to cope with the influx of refugees. Not all of the refugees have been able to return to their former homes.\n\nThe central government has made some repairs in major urban centers, and rebuilt a few tourist attractions, such as Shush Castle. There is a new steelworks in Ahvaz, and a new dam on the Karun River. However, some sites, such as the city of Khorramshahr, are still desolate ruins.\n\nKhuzestanis have protested, claiming that oil revenues from their province are used elsewhere and they are left to cope with the aftermath of the war as best they can. There has been much unrest among Arabic-speaking and Arab-heritage Khuzestanis, who claim that they face discrimination. Riots and mass arrests made international news in 2005.\n\n\n"}

At that time the main line was a single track, with a crossing loop and a down refuge siding at Exeter.\n\nThe up fast goods train was running late by the time it reached Exeter. Despite the train being too long to be accommodated in the loop at that station, the signaller [night officer] turned the train into the loop. When the locomotive had reached the points at the Sydney end of the station, the rear of the train was still on the main line at the southern end.\n\nFaced with the knowledge that the Temora Mail would soon be due, the goods train was brought forward so that it could be reversed into a siding on the eastern side of the station yard. It was during this manoeuvre that the Temora Mail struck the goods train head-on.\n\nQuestions were swiftly raised as to why two trains should collide when the goods train should have had the protection of the home signal. The mail train driver claimed that the distant signal was clear when he passed it, however as there was a thick fog at the time, he did not sight the home signal, which was against him, until the train was right upon it.\n\nAt a subsequent trial, the driver of the mail was brought before the Goulburn Circuit Court charged with manslaughter. At that trial, the night officer at Exeter gave evidence to the effect that the down distant signal was in fact at danger at the time the mail train passed. The night officer further stated that there was no fog that night, but that just before the goods train arrived a slight mist had set in. However, the goods train driver gave conflicting evidence, stating that on the night of the accident the denseness of the fog made it difficult to see the signals.\n\nAfter a retirement of more than four hours, a verdict of not guilty was delivered by the jury.\n\nThe collision killed 14. Five were said to have been killed almost instantly, three died while still crushed in their carriages, one succumbed as rescuers reached him, and two died on the Exeter station platform. The remaining three reportedly died in a sleeping carriage that had been turned into a temporary hospital. Alfred Bray, the guard was one of those killed in the collision.\n"}

{"id": "1987561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987561", "title": "Popils", "text": "Popils\n\nPopils, known in Europe as Popils The Blockbusting Challenge and in Japan as , is a stage-based puzzle platform video game for the Sega Game Gear. It was released in the early 1990s by Tengen in Japan. It has the option of English or Japanese-language play.\n\nThere is a short animation during the game intro explaining a beautiful Princess and a Boy fall in love. But the evil wizard named Popil kidnaps her and traps her inside an enchanted forest and it is up to the Boy to rescue her. When the game is completed the Boy and Princess are happily reunited and it's revealed Popil kidnapped the Princess because he was jealous and he loves her too.\n\nPopils is a single-player puzzle game in the form of a two dimensional side-view platform game. The player controls one character, a Boy through different stages (referred to as rounds) and must reach the Princess on every stage to complete it. Gameplay focuses on destroying blocks, avoiding enemies and spikes, and using various ladders and warp doors to reach the Princess. Each stage is one fixed screen and does not scroll in any direction and is completed when the Boy and Princess meet, or failed when either the Boy or Princess is killed, the Boy and Princess have no health and will die upon contact with an enemy, or falling onto a spike. The puzzle aspect is based on destroying certain blocks using the player's punch/kick/head-butt action. When a block is destroyed the column of blocks above it fall down one square and doing this can change the layout of the stage altering possible paths for the Boy, or for the Princess and enemies which move around. On many stages the player must move the Boy for the most part to reach the Princess, but in some stages movement of the Boy is restricted to a small area and the player must make him punch certain blocks to create a path for the princess to follow to the Boy.\n\nThe concept of steps is used to calculate score and whether a stage is completed perfectly. Punching/kicking/head-butting once is one step and walking or climbing one square (16 pixels) also counts as one step. To complete the game \"perfectly\" all 100 stages must be completed using the same or fewer number of steps as the mapper.\n\nIn normal game mode there are 100 stages of increasing difficulty, a stage select screen is shown where any available stage can be picked to play but only stages 1-5 are available at first. Completing any four stages unlocks the next five, and they do not have to be completed in any order or in sequence. Thus stages 1-10 are available to play after completing any four stages from 1-5 and stages 1-15 are available when any eight stages are completed until finally all 100 stages are available to play after any 76 stages have been completed. This means that player can choose to skip one stage out of each set of five and still be able to play stage 100.\n\nOn the stage select screen the player can look at all available stages. Uncompleted stages are be displayed in greyscale, completed stages are yellow and may be played again. Also displayed is the number of steps the \"mapper\" or stage designer used to complete the stage and the fewest the player has used, if the stage has been completed; pressing the '1' button on the stage select screen reveals a hint as to how the player might go about completing that stage. The hints point you in the right direction but there is still thought and skill required to complete the stage. \n\nCompleting all 100 stages in any number of steps completes the game and show the credits and ending animation sequence. The game then encourages you to complete each stage \"perfectly\".\n\nAfter completing the game once all stages are available to play, though the player may not have completed them all. If the player has completed a stage in the same or fewer number of steps as the mapper, the stage is displayed as \"perfect\" and coloured green on the stage select screen. Whether intentional or not some stages can be completed in fewer steps than the mapper, some by quite a difference. Others require pixel precision and use of movement tricks to equal or beat the mapper step count. When the player has completed all stages \"perfectly\" the credits are be shown again with a slightly different ending sequence. \n\nAfter completing the game \"perfectly\", and viewing the alternative ending, the player is given the chance to continue once more. If the player chooses to continue they're taken to a secret stage, Round 0, which has to be completed using a gameplay trick the player has not seen before in any of the other 100 stages of the game. The player can continue over and over and keep trying to beat Round 0. If the player powers off the console before they complete Round 0 and have activated the Resume feature they will be able to try it again the next time they load the game. If the player is not using the Resume feature, or when prompted chooses End rather than Continue, there is no way to get back to it during normal gameplay and the game will need to be completed \"perfectly\" again.\n\nIn map edit the player can create their own stages and test them, up to 30 stages can be saved on the cartridge. A stage must feature the boy and princess, can have 0-7 enemies, and if doors are used there must be two of each. Note all the normal game stages also follow the same rules. The Japanese manual includes screenshots of a selection of 10 stages that are not otherwise available in the game, that can be entered into the map editor and played.\n\n"}

It crosses the north–south Uriah Butler Highway (UBH) at Valsayn. Constructed during World War II to connect the US Army base with Port of Spain, the highway was named for the two wartime leaders, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nConstruction began in December 1941 and was completed in March 1942. Originally reserved for the US armed forces, the road was turned over to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago on October 24, 1949.\n\nThe Churchill–Roosevelt begins at the Barataria interchange, where traffic from Lady Young and the Beetham join. The highway then passes south of San Juan and through the El Socorro and Aranjuez area. It has a massive, congested intersection at El Socorro Road. In order to relieve the situation, a new interchange is being constructed to replace the present intersection. Further east, the congestion with UBH at Valsayn has been alleviated by a brand new flyover. The Churchill–Roosevelt continues east pass St. Augustine, Tunapuna, Tacarigua, Trincity, Arouca, Maloney and Mausica before narrowing to two lanes. After this, it circles the town of Arima and ends soon after.\n\nWhen WWII commenced, Trinidad became an important strategic point in the war effort. Through the Bases Agreement signed by British PM, Sir Winston Churchill, and the US President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Britain got 50 old American destroyers, and the US was granted the right to establish bases in the British Territories. Although the US Army had several bases on the island by 1941, the most important were Chaguaramas and the Air Base at Wallerfield, called Fort Read. The road communications between the Port of Spain (POS) and Fort Read near Cumuto was problematic as it consisted solely of the crowded Eastern Main Road, which slowed down the large convoys moving between the two bases. The decision was made in 1941 to build a military two lane paved road between Fort Read and the Morvant Junction of the Eastern Main Road just outside POS (the extension of the highway, the Beetham Highway, would not be built until the 1950s.)\n\nWork began almost immediately, with the highway forever bisecting rural communities like St. Augustine, El Socorro and Tacarigua. Many crop farmers had to be moved as bulldozers ploughed the course. This era in history is documented in Samuel Selvon’s classic novel, A Brighter Sun, where an inexperienced Indian youth is thrust headlong into the highway-building process. When the road was opened in 1942, it was the finest road in the island, being smooth and pothole free from end to end. It was not immediately asphalted, as it was pressed into service for the convoys almost as soon as the way was graded (a stark contrast to our roads today). Wilson Minshall, father of \"masman\" Peter Minshall, remarked “The new Roosevelt–Churchill Highway has swept across the country from Cumuto to a point near Laventille with the force of a flood rushing into a quiet valley. Cleared and graded but not yet surfaced, its naked earth weaves and interweaves protesting patterns under the wheels of army trucks and construction tractors that cannot wait until the road is finished. \n\nOpened in 1942 and reserved exclusively for military traffic, with exceptions being made for top-ranking civil service personnel. Military police in jeeps constantly patrolled the 15 mile road looking for violators, who most often were Indian peasants in mule and bull carts crossing the blacktop in their own good time while speeding traffic bore down on them; with several accidents having happened in this way. \n\nThe highway was finally opened up for civilian use on October 4th, 1949.\n\nThere are currently plans to extend the Churchill–Roosevelt to Manzanilla as a world-class four-lane highway.\n\n"}

It refers to a permanent stone constructed enclosure in which animals could be kept. other animal hold places have different names like cerah: a temporary one course small stone construction to hold animals in.\n\nA hutch is a type of cage used typically for housing domestic rabbits. Other small animals can also be housed in hutches.\n\nMost hutches have a frame constructed of wood, including legs to keep the unit off the ground. The floor may be wood, wire mesh, or some combination of the two. Wire mesh is very bad for rabbits' feet and can cause sore hocks. One or more walls of the hutch are also wire mesh to allow for ventilation. Some hutches have built-in nest boxes and shingled roofs—these are generally intended to be placed directly outside rather than inside another shelter such as a barn. Some hutches have a felt roof. In any case it is important that the hutch is draft-free and provides a shelter in case the animal is scared and wants to retreat to a safe haven. Not only will this help protect your pet from harsh weather conditions, but also predator attacks. \n\nThe generally accepted minimum hutch size is 10 square feet for a 4 kg medium sized breed. If the animal is very protective or even aggressive, this is generally a sign that the hutch is too small. However, it has in the past decade, become unacceptable for people who are more knowledgeable about rabbits' needs that they should live in a hutch of this size, or any small cage for that matter. Rabbits love to run and jump and need space. For many animal rescues, now a predator safe run must be attached to, or contain the hutch; the run must be at least 10 ft x 6 ft with a run height of 3ft, or in metric, 3m x 2m and a run height of 1m. (Rabbit Welfare Association and Trust, 2018) Even more space to live in is better.\n\nRabbit Hutch\n"}

At the midpoint of the war, he commanded the Department of Western Virginia, defending the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and the vital salt mines. Later he commanded the district of South Carolina.\n\nOn December 17, 1819, Samuel Jones was born at \"Woodfield\", his parents' plantation in Powhatan County, Virginia. His father, Samuel Jones, was a nephew and ward of Governor William Branch Giles, of Virginia, under whose care he was brought up, and a graduate of Princeton College. Jones' mother was Ann Moseley, daughter of Mr. Edward Moseley, of Powhatan County.\n\nJones was appointed a cadet at West Point United States Military Academy from Virginia July 1, 1837, and was graduated and was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Artillery Regiment on September 28, 1841. His first duty was on the Maine frontier, at Houlton, pending the Disputed Territory controversy with Canada. He was on duty at West Point, 1846–51, as assistant professor of mathematics and assistant instructor in artillery and infantry tactics.\n\nHe was appointed assistant to the Judge Advocate of the Army at Washington and continued in the discharge of the duties of his position until he resigned his commission in the Army of the United States April 27, 1861. Thus immediately prior to the American Civil War he was on the staff of the Judge Advocate of the Army in Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the secession of Virginia in 1861, Jones was commissioned as a major in the State of Virginia corps of artillery on May 1, 1861 in the military force of Virginia and later was promoted to be Colonel.\n\nHe later joined the Provisional Confederate Army and was promoted to colonel in recognition of his service, and on July 21, 1861, was promoted to brigadier general (the brigade consisted of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Eleventh Georgia, and the Fourth Kentucky Regiments of Infantry and Alberto's Artillery). On July 22, 1861, he was made Chief of Artillery and Ordnance of the C.S. Army of Northern Virginia. He served on the staff of General P G T Beauregard at the First Battle of Manassas, and was appointed to the command of the brigade of C.S. Army Colonel Francis S. Bartow, which had lost its commander on the field of Manassas.\n\nOn January 22, 1862, C.S. Army Brigadier General Jones was appointed to the command of the department of which Pensacola was the headquarters. He was promoted to major general on March 10, 1862. On September 23, 1862, he was assigned to the command of the Department of East Tennessee. From December 4, 1862, until March 4, 1864, Jones commanded the Department of Western Virginia, with his headquarters at Dublin, Virginia. He was in general charge of the operations in defense of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and the vital salt mines. The September 1863 Battle of Blountville was the initial step in a Union attempt to force Jones and his command to retire from East Tennessee. Jones was replaced in favor of General John Cabell Breckinridge.\n\nFrom April, 1864 to October, 1864, he was in command of the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He then commanded the District of South Carolina until January 1865. When the Union Navy began shelling Charleston, South Carolina, Jones placed fifty captured Federal officers brought into town under guard. He then advised Union Maj. Gen. John G. Foster to stop the bombardment unless he wanted to risk killing his own men. An irate Foster retaliated by placing captured Confederates, including Brig. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson, directly in the line of fire from Jones's guns.\n\nIn February 1865, Jones was named the commander of the Department of Florida and South Georgia, a post he held until the end of hostilities. Here he made one of the last stands of the Confederacy at the Battle of Natural Bridge, and held his position until the surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. He surrendered at Tallahassee, Florida on May 10, 1865.\n\nFrom 1873 to 1875, Jones served as president of the Maryland Agricultural College.\n\nJones died in Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania, and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}

Incumbent Governor Bob Taft could not run for re-election, because Ohio governors are limited to two consecutive terms in office. The election was held concurrently with a U.S. Senate election.\n\nThe general election for governor pitted Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, the Republican nominee, against United States Congressman Ted Strickland of Ohio's 6th congressional district, the Democratic nominee.\n\nTheir running mates were former Ohio Attorney General Lee Fisher on the Democratic ticket and State Representative Tom Raga on the Republican ticket.\n\nIn the end, the contest was not close, and Strickland captured about 60 percent of the vote; Blackwell conceded to Strickland at about 8:45 p.m. EST on November 7, 2006. As of 2020, this is the most recent election in which a Democrat was elected Governor of Ohio.\n\nAs the election approached, there was increasing national attention on the Ohio gubernatorial election, focused largely on the ability of the Republican party to maintain control in Ohio. Results in Ohio in 2006 were regarded as a possible bellwether for the 2008 presidential election; Ohio was considered a crucial swing state, with 20 electoral votes. Since the Republican Party's inception in 1854, no Republican presidential candidate has ever been elected to office without the electoral votes of Ohio. In contrast, a Democratic candidate has won the national election without the support of Ohio seven times (1836, 1844, 1856, 1884, 1892, 1944, 1960). Overall, Ohio's electoral votes have gone to the winner of the election 78% of the time.\n\nComedian and talk-show host Jon Stewart taped \"The Daily Show\" from October 30 to November 2, 2006, at the Roy Bowen Theater on the campus of Ohio State University. The series of episodes was entitled \"Battlefield Ohio: The Daily Show's Midwest Midterm Midtacular\" and was intended to bring further national attention to the election in Ohio. This was only the second time that the show had been filmed in a location other than New York City.\n\nOhio played a decisive role in the 2004 presidential election, as Ohio's electoral votes would have been sufficient to swing the election from George W. Bush to John Kerry had Kerry won in Ohio. Given the importance of the state, Blackwell's role in the conduct of the election was closely scrutinized. As Ohio Secretary of State, Blackwell was the state's chief elections officer. He was also an honorary co-chair for the Bush re-election campaign in Ohio and the most prominent backer of a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage on the same ballot.\n\nLeading up to the election Blackwell made a number of decisions about the election process, most of which placed additional restrictions on voting. Opponents argued that Blackwell's decisions would have the effect of suppressing turnout among vulnerable populations, most of whom would be expected to vote for Kerry in the presidential contest—and that Blackwell had a conflict of interest as a co-chair of Bush's re-election campaign. Supporters argued that the Secretary of State had always been a partisan political office and that there was nothing wrong with Blackwell having a preference in the presidential elections; they denied that Blackwell's decisions were designed to benefit Bush.\n\nReaction to Blackwell's conduct was so strong that a coalition of left-leaning organizations attempted to amend the Ohio Constitution to abolish the Secretary of State's oversight of elections, as part of a package of election reforms. The proposal was rejected by voters in November 2005. Dissatisfaction with Blackwell's involvement in the 2004 election apparently hurt him with Ohio's African-American community; according to exit polls, Blackwell received only 20% of the African-American vote in 2006. Exit polls showed that confidence in the election process among Ohio voters was even lower than voters in Florida, the state which produced an unprecedented five-week post-election fight in 2000. But among voters \"very confident\" that votes would be counted accurately, Blackwell actually \"led\" Strickland.\n\nEntering the 2006 campaign, Ohio had been dominated for a decade by Republicans. Republicans had held the governorship for sixteen years, occupied all statewide constitutional offices, and controlled both houses of the state legislature.\n\nAt a low point in his popularity in November 2005, Taft garnered only a 6.5% approval rating. According to polling organization Survey USA, this was a lower proportion than any governor in the United States. A poll taken in May 2006 indicated that only 2% of Ohio residents \"strongly approved\" of Taft's performance. The low approval ratings led pollster John Zogby to comment, \"I'm not aware of anyone who's ever sunk lower.\"\n\nTaft's low approval ratings follow several years of scandals. In 2005, Taft pleaded no contest to four ethics violations involving illegal gifts totaling $5,800. He was convicted of four misdemeanors and was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine and apologize to the people of Ohio. Taft is the only Ohio governor to be convicted of a crime while in office.\n\nIn 1996 the Republican controlled Ohio General Assembly removed a restriction requiring that state investments only be in safer, though lower-yielding, bonds. After the restriction was eliminated, hundreds of millions of dollars in state funds were invested by a number of investment firms with close ties to the Republican party. Among those investments was $50 million of the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation fund which was given to Thomas Noe, an investor in rare and unusual coins and major donor to the Republican Party including then-governor Bob Taft.\n\nIn 2005 it was revealed that Noe could only account for $13 million of the original investment. Among the missing funds were two coins worth over $300,000 alone. Throughout 2005, there was a protracted legal battle over the release of records which Noe claimed were privileged and prosecutors claimed were in the public domain. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled 5-2 in favor of the prosecutors. On February 13, 2006, Noe was indicted on 53 counts, including: engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity (which carries a mandatory 10-year sentence), 11 counts of theft, 11 counts of money laundering, 8 counts of tampering with records, and 22 counts of forgery. The charges also accuse Noe of personally stealing $2 million. On November 20, 2006, Noe was found guilty of theft, money laundering, forgery and corrupt activity, and was sentenced to serve 18 years in prison, fined $213,000, ordered to pay the $2 million cost of his prosecution and make restitution to the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation.\n\nAlso in 2006, Noe pleaded guilty to three charges of using over a dozen people in 2004 as illegal \"conduits\" to make donations to George W. Bush's re-election campaign of over $45,000 in order to skirt laws limiting donations in federal campaigns to $2,000. Noe was convicted and sentenced to 27 months in federal prison and ordered to pay a $136,000 fine.\n\n\nWhen Strickland first launched his campaign, he was originally also in a tough fight for the nomination, as Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman was also campaigning and raising money. Before attacks were traded between the nominees, Coleman bowed out, citing a need to spend more time with his family.\n\n\nBlackwell and Petro were initially going to be joined in their competitive primary by Ohio State Auditor Betty Montgomery, but Montgomery withdrew from the contest and instead ran for state attorney general, an office she lost. The campaign between the two candidates then heated up; despite commercials preaching his conservative values, Petro was never able to shake his previous pro-choice stance. As the election approached, the barbs grew worse between Petro and Blackwell, only serving to bring more negative attention to the Ohio Republican Party.\n\nThe race for the 2006 election was, in 2006, the most expensive in Ohio's history. Reflective of both the national significance of the race, as well as the powerful fund-raising capabilities of both parties, Blackwell and Strickland passed the previous fund raising record set in 1998. That record, set when current Governor Bob Taft was running against Lee Fisher (Strickland's running mate), totaled a combined $18 million by the end of the election. As of September 9, 2006, Blackwell and Strickland had already raised a combined $21.2 million. Strickland led Blackwell, $11.2 million to $10 million. Most of the money raised in Ohio by both major party candidates came from a single zip code in downtown Columbus, which is home to their respective parties, labor and political groups, lobbyists and lawyers.\n\nA significant amount of money was spent by private groups on behalf of the candidates as well, the estimated combined total at the time of the May 2 primary was $50 million.\n\nSince the first polls on the general election matchup were taken in November 2005, Strickland led Blackwell, though the margin substantially increased in March 2006.\n\nThe greatest margin recorded in an individual poll was found in the October 26, 2006, SurveyUSA poll which showed Strickland leading by 30 points. The smallest recorded margin was the February 6, 2006, Zogby poll showing Strickland leading by a mere 3 points. When the results are averaged across the different polls, the greatest margin was in October 2006 with a difference of 22.6 points in favor of Strickland. The smallest average margin was during January 2006 with Strickland leading Blackwell by 4 points.\n\nStrickland, the Democrat, did very well. Strickland won most areas of the state. Strickland trounced Blackwell in eastern Ohio, with Blackwell only carrying one county in this region (Holmes). Blackwell did well in the Cincinnati suburbs, although he only narrowly managed to win Hamilton County which encompasses the City of Cincinnati by just about 2,000 votes. Blackwell did manage to win some rural western counties as well. Blackwell only managed to win 16 out of Ohio's 88 counties. Strickland not only did well in areas that lean more Republican, but he also won the traditional Democratic counties. Strickland trounced Blackwell in Cuyahoga County and Franklin County, home of Cleveland and Columbus respectively. Strickland also performed strongly in the Democratic rust belt area from Cleveland all the way to Toledo. Strickland also did well in the Akron-Youngstown Area.

{"id": "1987585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987585", "title": "Point Lookout State Park", "text": "Point Lookout State Park\n\nPoint Lookout State Park is a public recreation area and historic preserve occupying Point Lookout, the southernmost tip of a peninsula formed by the confluence of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River in St. Mary's County, Maryland. The state park preserves the site of an American Civil War prisoner of war camp and the Point Lookout Light, which was built in 1830. It is the southernmost spot on Maryland's western shore, the coastal region on the western side of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nCaptain John Smith, the famed explorer who surveyed the Mid-Atlantic region for the British Crown, came ashore at Point Lookout in 1608. He surveyed the lands and waters of the area, including the mouth of the Potomac River on the south side of Point Lookout and its small nearby tributary, the St. Mary's River. Smith gave very favorable reports on the area to the king of England, remarking on the abundant game and fishing opportunities, the fertile soil and the strategic military value of the area, overlooking the confluence of the Potomac River, Patuxent River and the St. Mary's River, along with its key vantage point on the Chesapeake Bay itself. All of these factors led him to describe it as a prime spot for a potential British colony.\n\nThe first settlement in Maryland occurred in 1634, in nearby St. Mary's City. At that time, Point Lookout became part of St. Michael's Manor, one of the main holdings of Leonard Calvert, the leader of the new colony and the first proprietary governor of colonial Maryland.\n\nBecause of its strategic position, Point Lookout was raided by British forces during the American Revolution.\n\nThe area got its name from its role as a lookout post, used to watch British ship movements during the War of 1812.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 the Chesapeake Bay was a major route for British War ships, who established a naval and military base at near-by Tangier Island in Virginia for the Royal Navy under Rear Admiral George Cockburn with Fort Albion there, which constantly raided Chesapeake Bay waterfront towns, villages and farms and scattered community residents, and also eventually attacked and burned Washington D.C. and unsuccessfully attacked the City of Baltimore during 1813 and 1814.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, a local citizen militia in St. Mary's County established a clandestine base on Point Lookout to monitor movements of British warships on Chesapeake Bay. The militia also established a secret nighttime system of post riders to send intelligence reports from Point Lookout to Washington, D.C., in order to keep President James Madison up to date on British movements. St. Mary's County's roads were notoriously rough at the time, and the trek by horse was more than 80 miles, so a relay system was set up, passing messages from one rider to the next.\n\nThe citizen militia worked clandestinely in the area for over a year, until the British came ashore, seized and occupied Point Lookout. The militia was no match for the overwhelming power and number of seasoned British ground troops. This had the effect of blinding American intelligence efforts in the region, and is thought to have contributed to the eventual Burning of Washington in August 1814 by British troops. President Madison and United States Secretary of War, John Armstrong, Jr. was later faulted for not aiding the militia in Point Lookout.\n\nIn 1862, during the American Civil War, much of the land around Point Lookout was transformed into a bustling port and temporary city of civilians and military personnel and numerous buildings, including a large Union Army hospital, a United States Army garrison at Fort Lincoln, and a Union prisoner of war camp to hold Confederate States Army soldier captives.\n\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, of the 50,000 soldiers held in the army prison camp at Lookout Point, all of whom were housed in tents, nearly 4,000 died. The death rate of 8 percent was less than half of the death rate among soldiers who were in the field with their own armies. The camp, originally built to hold 10,000 men, swelled to between 12,000 and 20,000 prisoners after the exchange of prisoners between armies was placed on hold. The result was crowded conditions with up to sixteen men to a tent in poor sanitary conditions. It was the largest Union-run prison camp and its reputation was one of the worst.\n\nToday, a Confederate prisoner of war memorial and cemetery exist on the former grounds of the Point Lookout prisoner of war camp. The mass grave holds 3,384 Confederate prisoners of war who died at the prison camp. The grave is marked by a pillar inscribed at its base with the names of the dead. The privately funded Confederate Memorial Park occupies a three-acre site next to the cemetery. Although a United States flag is flown in front of the memorial, a prominent Confederate flag is situated on a flagpole just outside the gates of the grounds, in memory of those dead Southern soldiers.\n\nBecause of the extensive water erosion of the Chesapeake Bay shoreline in the last 150 years, half of the original site of the prisoner of war stockade has been obliterated and washed away by the bay.\n\nToday, Point Lookout State Park retains Point Lookout Light, the original lighthouse built in 1830, a fishing pier, boat launch facilities, public beaches and facilities, overnight camping, Civil War historical remains, and, reputedly, ghosts. The Civil War Museum/Marshland Nature Center has seasonal hours and is closed in winter.\n\nPoint Lookout State Park has long had a reputation in local folklore as a place that harbors numerous ghosts. This has been written about in the news many times since the Civil War.\n\nThe park is used as the setting in the \"Point Lookout\" add-on for the video game \"Fallout 3\", which includes references to its use as a POW camp as well as various features of the park, including Calvert's manor and the lighthouse.\n\n\n\n"}

He was awarded a gallantry medal Bir Uttom. After independence he was inducted into the Bangladesh Army for administrative retirement with the rank of Lieutenant colonel.\nHe turned into a radical political activist and leader of the left wing Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal.\n\nHe was responsible for the 6 November coup uprising which caused severe disruption in discipline and chaos within the rank and structure of the military inside Dhaka Cantonment. Many killings resulted in his instigation. After Ziaur Rahman was reinstated as army chief, discipline was reinstated. Many personnel including Taher was found guilty of high treason and murder and executed. However, in 2011, only his trial were declared illegal by the high court leaving his actions intact and punishable.\n\nAbu Taher was born in Badarpur, Assam Province of British India on 14 November 1938. His ancestral village was Kazla in Purbadhala, Netrokona District of Bangladesh. After completion of higher secondary school from Murari Chand College in Sylhet, Taher joined the Pakistani Army in September 1960 as an officer candidate. He was married to Lutfa Taher.\n\nTaher received his Commission in 1962 as a second lieutenant in the Pakistan Army. He joined the elite Pakistan Special Services Group (Commando Force) in 1965. Following his training, he participated in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 in the Sialkot sector of Kashmir. For his part, he received a war participation medal from the Pakistan Army. After the war, Taher took officers pre qualification course on guerrilla warfare at Fort Benning in the United States in 1969. He was posted to the Quetta Staff College, Pakistan in 1970.\n\nTowards the end of August 1971 Captain Taher, along with three other Bengali officers: Capt. Patwari, Maj. Manzoor and Capt. Ziauddin defected from the Pakistan Army and crossed over the border near Abbottabad, West Pakistan, into India. After two weeks under Indian intelligence screening and debriefing, he was sent to Bangladesh Armed Forces (BDF) HQ at 8 Theatre Road, Calcutta and subsequently posted to Sector 11. He was promoted to Major in September . Major Zia appointed Taher as Sub-Sector Commander No. 2 at Mahendraganj. Sector 11 was located across the Rangpur District, which comprised Mymensingh District, Tangail District and parts of the Rangpur District. On October 10 upon Major Zia's temporary transfer to the Sylhet sector, Major Shafaat Jamil handed over interim command to of BDF Sector 11. On 2 November 1971, Taher lost his leg from a small mine blast during a debriefing. Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan was officially appointed Sector Commander of Sector 11 under direct orders through EAM from Colonel Osmani, Bangladesh Interim Provincial Government Headquarters. Taher was flown to Pune, India. On 21 November Taher received a Medical Board Release. His leg was later amputated there, where he remained until February 1972. For his valour, he was awarded Bir Uttom.\n\nFollowing his return, Taher was reinstated into the Bangladesh Army in April for effective retirement following administrative procedure. He was retired with a legacy entitlement rank of Lieutenant Colonel and hence is widely known as Colonel Taher.\n\nDue to his left-leaning communist ideas of organizing the Bangladesh Army along the lines of the People's Liberation Army, he resigned from the army to form the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, with\n\nThe Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal had split from the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Bangladesh Awami League and called for establishing socialism through an armed revolution. Taher became the head of its armed wing, the Gonobahini led a violent insurgency campaign against the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nAbu Taher welcomed the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 15 August 1975, remarking They've made a big mistake. They shouldn't have allowed Sheikh Mujib's burial. Now a shrine will be built there. His body should have been thrown into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nTaher quickly took advantage of the chaos following the assassination, exacerbating dissent among ranking non-commissioned officers and regular soldiers. Taher incited and organized an uprising of the soldiers on 7 November 1975. Together with Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal leader Hasanul Haq Inu, soldiers loyal tried to takeover Bangladesh Radio and also to remove Ziaur Rahman from cantonment, in order to facilitate a Marxist takeover of power.\n\nSome revenge killings took place of a number of military officers and their wives due to incidents dating back to injustices that occurred during the independence war in 1971. Acts of treason and clear serious breach of military discipline and morale followed. As chief of Staff, Major General Ziaur Rahman, worked to bring down the acts of treason and mutiny, after his release.\n\nOnce Ziaur Rahman retook charge of the army, he realized that the soldiers' mutiny had to be suppressed if discipline was to be restored. On 24 November 1975, he ordered Taher be arrested on charges of high treason and murder. Taher was tried by a military tribunal inside the Dhaka Central Jail and sentenced to death on 17 July 1976. He was executed by hanging on 21 July 1976. The trial was later considered flawed.\n\nOn 22 March 2011 the High Court overturned the previous judgement that authorised Taher's execution by a military tribunal while the nation was under martial law. The military court judgement was declared illegal. The court observed Taher's execution had happened according to Major General Zia's plan.\n\n\n"}

Guidobaldi or Guido Baldi), Marquis del Monte, was an Italian mathematician, philosopher and astronomer of the 16th century.\n\nDel Monte was born in Pesaro. His father, Ranieri, was from a leading wealthy family in Urbino. Ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture. The Duke of Urbino, Duke Guidobaldo II, honoured him with the title Marchese del Monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before Guidobaldo. On the death of his father Guidobaldo inherited the title of Marchese.\n\nGuidobaldo studied mathematics at the University of Padua in 1564. While there he became a friend of the great Italian poet Torquato Tasso. In fact Guidobaldo may have known Tasso before they studied at Padua together, for Tasso was almost exactly the same age as Guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the Duke of Urbino, with the duke's son, from 1556.\n\nGuidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in Hungary between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire. After serving in the army, Guidobaldo returned to his estate of (Monte Baroccio) Mombaroccio in the Marche, where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and optics. He studied mathematics under Federico Commandino during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples. He also became a friend of Bernardino Baldi, who was also a student of Commandino around the same time.\n\nHe corresponded with several mathematicians including Giacomo Contarini, Francesco Barozzi and Galileo Galilei. His invention of a drafting instrument for constructing regular polygons and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of Galileo's geometric and military compass.\n\nGuidobaldo was also important in helping Galileo Galilei in his academic career. Galileo, then a promising, but unemployed 26-year-old, had written an essay on hydrostatic balance, which struck Guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius. He then commended Galileo to his brother, the Cardinal Del Monte, who referred him to the powerful Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I de' Medici. Under his patronage, Galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the University of Pisa, in 1589. Guidobaldo became a staunch friend of Galileo and helped him again in 1592, when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua, due to the hatred and machinations of Giovanni de' Medici, a son of Cosimo I de' Medici, against Galileo. Notwithstanding their friendship, Guidobaldo was a critic of Galileo's principle of the isochronicity of the pendulum, a major discovery which Guidobaldo thought was impossible.\n\nGuidobaldo wrote an influential book about perspective, titled \"Perspectivae Libri VI\", published at Pesaro in 1600. Several painters, architects and the theater stage designer Nicola Sabbatini used this geometrical knowledge in their works.\n\nHe died at Mombaroccio in 1607.\n"}

He was best known for having played helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke on the television series \"Airwolf\" (1984–1987) and the protagonist, Matt Johnson, in the 1978 film \"Big Wednesday\". He also starred as Byron Henry in \"The Winds of War\".\n\nJan-Michael Vincent was born in Denver, Colorado, where his father was stationed after enlisting in the United States Army in 1941. His father, Lloyd Whiteley Vincent (September 7, 1919 – August 30, 2000), was born in Tulare, California and raised in nearby Hanford, California in the San Joaquin Valley. His mother, Doris Jane (née Pace; August 2, 1925 – February 22, 1993), was born in Arkansas and moved to Hanford as a toddler. Jan's grandfather, Herbert Vincent (September 26, 1876 – January 14, 1974), was a bank robber and counterfeiter who had masterminded robberies in the 1920s and 1930s. Jan's uncle, Lloyd's brother Hoy, was shot to death in Tulare by a sheriff's deputy and was wanted for a robbery that occurred in Oregon. Two of Vincent's other uncles, Clifford and Harold, were convicted of bank robbery in Hardwick and Strathmore in 1931. In 1932, Herbert and his son, Gordon, were arrested in Hanford in January for bank robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, which left Lloyd alone at age twelve.\n\nLloyd Vincent and Doris met in 1940 when she was in her early teens and Lloyd had finished high school. Lloyd was stationed in Denver in 1941 as a B-25 bomber pilot during World War II, and he married Doris there when she was sixteen. Jan's mistrust of authority came from later seeing his father in the Army being told what to do and when to do it. Jan Vincent's sister, Jaqueline \"Jacquie\" Vincent, was born in 1947. His brother, Christopher, was born in 1952. After the war, Lloyd became a painter, like Jan's grandfather, and later developed alcoholism. By the time Jan was born in 1944, his parents owned a sign company in Hanford.\n\nVincent attended elementary and high school in Hanford where he graduated in 1963 from Hanford High School. He attended Ventura College for three years and said, \"I would have completed college, but the registration clerk literally shut the window in my face for the lunch hour\", and Vincent instead took his $200 and went to Mexico to party. Years later, Vincent found himself in the same rigid system his father was in. He served in the California Army National Guard, and remained in the National Guard Reserve until 1971.\n\nVincent gained his first acting job in 1967 in \"The Bandits\", starring and co-directed by Robert Conrad. Also in 1967, Vincent appeared in the made-for-TV-movie \"The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Chinese Junk\".\n\nIn the late 1960s, Vincent was signed to Universal Studios and appeared in several television series. He made an appearance in the \"Dragnet 1968\" episode \"The Grenade\", as a muscular high school student who suffered an acid attack by a mentally unstable classmate (played by Mickey Sholdar). Vincent also appeared in the \"Danger Island\" segments of Hanna-Barbera's \"The Banana Splits\" series as Link (1968–1969). His first starring role was in the fall of 1969 in the prime-time soap opera \"The Survivors\", alongside Lana Turner and George Hamilton; the series was canceled mid-season.\n\nVincent also acted in several movies in the late 1960s, including the 1969 20th Century Fox movie \"The Undefeated\" (as Bubba Wilkes), starring John Wayne, Rock Hudson, and Antonio Aguilar. His name appeared as Michael Vincent in the credits of the movie. Vincent guest-starred in three episodes of \"Lassie\" with actor Tony Dow and two episodes of \"Bonanza\".\n\nIn 1970, Vincent garnered critical praise for his role in the made-for-TV film \"Tribes\" (also known as \"The Soldier Who Declared Peace\" in Europe and the UK), co-starring Darren McGavin, about a tough Marine boot-camp drill instructor dealing with a hippie draftee (Vincent) who will not follow the rules. He gave a complex performance opposite Robert Mitchum in \"Going Home\" (1971). That same year, he appeared in the \"Gunsmoke\" episode \"The Legend\". In 1972, Vincent appeared with Charles Bronson in the crime film \"The Mechanic\" and a made-for-TV love story \"Sandcastles\". In 1973, Vincent starred in the Disney comedy \"The World's Greatest Athlete\", with Tim Conway and John Amos. Vincent played Richie, an alcoholic teen in the 1973 \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" episode, \"Catch a Ring That Isn't There\". Also in 1973, he was in the made-for-TV-movie \"Deliver Us from Evil\" as Nick Fleming opposite George Kennedy.\n\nVincent also starred as the anti-hero Buster Lane in the 1974 romance \"Buster and Billie\", wherein he startled audiences with his full-frontal nudity. In \"Bite the Bullet\" (1975), he played opposite Gene Hackman, James Coburn, and Candice Bergen. He also starred in the trucker movie \"White Line Fever\" (1975); in \"Baby Blue Marine\" (1976), a war film directed by John D. Hancock, which also starred Glynnis O'Connor; and in \"Shadow of the Hawk\" (1976) co-starring Marilyn Hassett. Vincent also starred in \"Damnation Alley\" (1977), based on Roger Zelazny's science fiction novel. Two more notable 1978 appearances were the surfing film \"Big Wednesday\" with William Katt and Gary Busey, and \"Hooper\" with Burt Reynolds, in which Vincent played a young stuntman.\n\nIn 1980, Vincent starred in the gang-themed drama \"Defiance\", which received a limited release.

It is the role for which he is best known and remembered. It was noted at the time that Vincent's salary for his work on \"Airwolf\" was $200,000 per episode, the highest of any actor in American television at the time. While filming \"Airwolf\", Vincent admitted to having drug and alcohol problems for which he acknowledged seeking help. After \"Airwolf\" ended, he found roles in smaller budget and lower exposure film projects.\n\nVincent worked with Traci Lords in the 1991 suspense film \"Raw Nerve\". He also co-starred with Clint Howard in the 1996 black comedy/horror film \"Ice Cream Man\", which had a very limited theatrical release but eventually reached cult status via home video as an unintentional comedy. In 1994, he played in a South African produced movie called \"Ipi Tombi\", produced and directed by Tommie Meyer based on a musical by Bertha Egnos.\n\nWhile in the hospital in 1996, Vincent was committed to a role in \"Red Line\" with Chad McQueen as Keller. He appeared in the film with a swollen face and scars, and still wearing his hospital ID bracelet. In 1997, he had a small guest role on \"Nash Bridges\", playing the title character's long-lost brother, and in 1998 he had a cameo in the independent film \"Buffalo '66\". His last role was in the independent film \"White Boy\", also titled \"Menace\" (for the U.S. video version), released in March 2003.\n\nVincent was referenced in the animated sitcom \"Rick and Morty\" in the season 2 episode titled \"Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate\", wherein the family watches a fake commercial for an action adventure sci-fi movie called \"Jan Quadrant Vincent 16,\" starring fictionalized versions of Jan-Michael Vincent.\n\nVincent married Bonnie Portman in 1968, and they had a daughter, Amber Springbird Vincent, in 1972. The couple's divorce was finalized on January 2, 1977.\n\nVincent remarried in 1986. His second wife, Joanne Robinson, left him and entered a restraining order against him in 1998, alleging that he had abused her during their marriage.\n\nHe battled alcoholism and intravenous drug use for much of his life. In 1977, 1978, and 1979 he was arrested for possession of cocaine, and in 1984 and 1985 he was arrested after two bar brawls.\n\nHe was charged with felony assault in 1986, but was acquitted after his attorney argued that the woman tripped and fell on a telephone cord in his home. Vincent then was arrested for drunk driving but avoided jail by entering rehab in 1988. In 2000, a $374,000 default judgment was made against him after his former girlfriend alleged he had physically assaulted her after their breakup and caused her to miscarry their child.\n\nDuring the 1990s, he was involved in three severe automobile collisions, which he barely survived. In an accident in August 1996 Vincent broke three vertebrae in his neck. He sustained a permanent injury to his vocal cords from an emergency medical procedure, leaving him with a permanently raspy voice. The first near-fatal accident occurred in February 1992, and the third happened in September 1997.\n\nVincent was charged with drunk driving again after his 1996 accident, and once again sentenced to rehabilitation and placed on probation. In an interview on the television program \"The Insider\" on September 18, 2007, when asked about his 1996 car accident, Vincent answered, \"Y'know, I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't remember being in an accident.\"\n\nIn 2000, Vincent violated probation for his prior alcohol-related arrests by appearing drunk in public three times and assaulting his fiancée. As a result, he was sentenced to 60 days in the Orange County Jail. Vincent was involved in another automobile accident in 2008.\n\nIn an interview on October 24, 2014, with \"National Enquirer\", Vincent revealed that his right leg was amputated just below the knee in 2012 after he contracted a leg infection as a result of complications from peripheral artery disease. After that he walked with a prosthetic limb, although he was sometimes forced to use a wheelchair.\n\nVincent died on February 10, 2019 at the age of 74 in Asheville, North Carolina due to cardiac arrest while hospitalized at Mission Hospital Memorial Campus. Bradycardia, a decreased heart rate, was listed as an underlying cause of death. His death was not publicly announced until March 8, when TMZ broke the news and showed a slightly redacted copy of Vincent's death certificate. He is survived by his third wife, Patricia Ann Christ, and his daughter from his first marriage, Amber Vincent.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1987653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987653", "title": "Humboldt Bay", "text": "Humboldt Bay\n\nHumboldt Bay is a natural bay and a multi-basin, bar-built coastal lagoon located on the rugged North Coast of California, entirely within Humboldt County, United States. It is the largest protected body of water on the West Coast between San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound, the second-largest enclosed bay in California, and the largest port between San Francisco and Coos Bay, Oregon. The largest city adjoining the bay is Eureka, the regional center and county seat of Humboldt County, followed by the town of Arcata. These primary cities, together with adjoining unincorporated communities and several small towns, comprise a Humboldt Bay Area total population of nearly 80,000 people. This comprises nearly 60% of the population of Humboldt County. The bay is home to more than 100 plant species, 300 invertebrate species, 100 fish species, and 200 bird species. In addition, the bay and its complex system of marshes and grasses support hundreds of thousands of migrating and local shore birds.\nCommercially, this second-largest estuary in California is the site of the largest oyster production operations on the West Coast, producing more than half of all oysters farmed in California.\n\nThe Port of Humboldt Bay (also referred to as the Port of Eureka) is a deep water port with harbor facilities, including large industrial docks at Fairhaven, Samoa, and Fields Landing, designed to serve cargo and other vessels. Several marinas also located in Greater Eureka have the capacity to serve hundreds of small to mid-size boats and pleasure craft. Since the 1850s, the bay was used extensively to export logs and forest products as part of the historic West coast lumber trade. There is now infrequent shipping of this product.\n\nHumboldt Bay is the only deep water bay between the San Francisco Bay and Coos Bay, Oregon. The Port of Humboldt Bay is the only protected deep water port for large ocean-going vessels for the large region. Despite being the only protected harbor along nearly of coastline, the bay's location was undiscovered or at least unreliably charted for centuries after the first arrival of European explorers to the Pacific Coast. This is partially because the bay is difficult to see from the ocean. The harbor opens to the sea through a narrow and historically treacherous passage, which was blocked from direct view because of sandbars. Formation of such sandbars is now managed by a system of jetties. Contributing to the bay's isolation were features of the coastal mountain range, which extends from the ocean approximately inland, and the common marine layer (fog) in addition to frequent clouds or rain.\n\nThe bay is approximately long but can be from wide at the entrance to the widest point at in the North Bay. The surface area of Humboldt Bay is of which are intertidal mudflats. More than are primarily eelgrass habitat, which has been relatively constant since 1871, although more than 80% of the bay's coastal marsh habitats have been lost or fragmented by levee, railroad and highway construction. At high tide the surface area is approximately , but it is at low tide. Each tidal cycle replaces 41% of the water in Humboldt Bay, although exchange in small channels and sloughs of the bay can take up to three weeks.\n\nHumboldt Bay began to form when a river valley drowned about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago during a period of rapid sea level rise. Bay sediments also contain buried salt marsh deposits showing that areas of the bay have subsided during episodic large magnitude subduction earthquakes.\n\nThree rivers, the Mad, Elk, and Eel, drained into Humboldt Bay during the mid-Pleistocene. Subsequently, the Mad River cut a new outlet to the sea, and the flow of the Eel was diverted by tectonic uplift of Table Bluff at the southern end of the bay, but Elk River continues to drain into Humboldt Bay.\n\nIn the 21st century, the bay is considered to have three regions:\n\n\nDaby, Woodley, and Indian islands are in the North Bay, and all three are within the City of Eureka. Low tides reveal two more islands: Sand Island, which was formed from dredge spoils left in the early 20th century, and Bird Island. A large eelgrass bed in the South Bay, which may be exposed at low tides, is locally known as Clam Island.\n\nThe Wiyot people are the first to inhabit the Humboldt Bay region, including the Mad River, and Eel River. It is estimated that the Wiyot arrived at Humboldt Bay circa 900 A.D.\n\nThe Wiyot language is related to the Algonquian language of the Great Plains. The Wiyot Tribe is located in Loleta, California. Tribal members reside on two different reservations, the Table Bluff reservation and the old Table Bluff reservation, sometimes referred to as Indianola. The old reservation, roughly 20 acres, was originally purchased by a local church group to relocate homeless Wiyot in the early 1900s. While the old reservation is still in use, the tribe moved to the new Table Bluff reservation. The new reservation is roughly 88 acres.\n\nWiyot territory is divided into three different regions: lower Mad River, Humboldt Bay, and lower Eel River. Their entire territory was only around 36 miles long and roughly 15 miles wide. Although relatively small, Wiyot territory encompassed miles of old growth redwood forests, sandy dunes, wetlands and open prairies. Due to its large abundance, redwood trees were often used by the Wiyot. Most notably, they made canoes and small houses out of the durable redwood. The average redwood canoe would be at a minimum of 18 feet long and 4 feet wide. To make the canoes, the Wiyot would fell a tree and hollow out the log with fire. Their houses would be made out of redwood planks, forming a rectangular shape. A pitched roof would be built on top. It is estimated that there were around 98 Wiyot villages built along Humboldt Bay and the nearby river banks\n\nThe Wiyot diet mainly consisted of acorns, berries, shellfish, salmon, deer, elk and other small game. Various species of acorns and berries were collected in large quantities as they were a major part of their diet.\n\nThe Wiyot name for Humboldt Bay is called \"Wike\" or \"Wiki\". Unfortunately, later encounters between settlers and the Wiyot people turned violent, as the settlers encroached on traditional territories. The settlers initiated what is known as the 1860 Wiyot Massacre. Every year, around the month of February, the Wiyot people would gather for their World Renewal Ceremony on Indian Island, which lasted 7 to 10 days. During this ceremony, the men would leave each night to replenish supplies, leaving women, children, and elders on the island to rest. In the early morning hours of February 26, 1860, local settlers from the nearby town of Eureka descended onto Indian Iasland armed with firearms, clubs, knives, and hatchets. For over an hour, the group of settlers killed and mutilated every single Wiyot they could find. The majority of those murdered were women, children, and elders. The remaining survivors, including those on and off the island, were rounded up and then imprisoned at Fort Humboldt.\n\nEarly explorers in the region, including Francis Drake, Sebastián Vizcaíno, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, and George Vancouver, did not discover the bay because of a combination of circumstances: the way the bay is hidden from an ocean approach, storms, and fog. Captain Jonathan Winship is credited with the first recorded entry into Humboldt Bay by sea in June 1806, while employed by the Russian-American Company a major trading company. His party, including Aleut in baidarka to hunt sea otter, were met with hostility by the local Indians. Winship's party named this body of water as \"Bay of Resanof\", after Nikolai Rezanov, the Chamberlain of the Russian Tsar, and son-in-law of Grigory Shelikhov, who was the founder of the first Russian colony in North America.\n\nIn 1849, an expedition of seven men led by Josiah Gregg attempted to find an overland route to the Pacific Ocean. They left from the gold town of Weaverville for the 150-mile trek to the sea. Because of the density of the redwood forests, and because Gregg stopped frequently to measure latitude and the size of the trees, the expedition averaged only two miles per day. The party was near starvation when they emerged on the coast, where on 20 December 1849, they discovered what is now known as Humboldt Bay. After stocking up on food, the party walked to San Francisco to report their discovery of the bay.\n\nIn March 1850, two ships, the \"General Morgan\" and the \"Laura Virginia\", were sent to the bay from San Francisco. After considerable initial difficulty with waves breaking heavily over shifting sands of the bar crossing, the ships entered the bay in 1850. The members of the \"Laura Virginia\" company named the bay after Alexander von Humboldt, a noted German naturalist.\n\nHumboldt Bay was charted by the United States Coast Survey in 1850, although the map was not published until 1852.\n\nAfter two years of white settlement on Humboldt Bay, in 1852 only six ships sailed from the bay to San Francisco. But by 1853, on the same route, 143 ships loaded with lumber for markets crossed the bar. Of those, despite the best efforts of local pilots and tugs, 12 ships wrecked on the bar. In times of bad weather, ships could be forced to remain in harbor for weeks before attempting the crossing. The first marker at the harbor entrance was placed in 1853.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Government authorized funds for a lighthouse near the mouth to improve navigation. In 1856 the Humboldt Harbor Light was built on the north spit. In 1872 a bell boat was added, and two years later, a steam whistle replaced the bell to assist mariners during times of dense fog. Eighty-one people drowned between 1853 and 1880 during bar crossings, including the captain of the brig \"Crimea,\" who was washed overboard while crossing the bar on 18 February 1870. The Humboldt Bay Life-Saving Station is on the bay side of the North Spit, south of the World War II era blimp base.\n\nBy the 1880s, long wharves were built into the bay for easier loading the lumber shipments. Shipbuilding became part of local industry. The Bendrixson shipyards produced 120 ships on Humboldt Bay. The volume of shipping reached about 600 vessels a year by 1881. Humboldt Bay was made an official United States port of entry in 1882, a status that permitted shipping from there directly to overseas ports. In 1886, fierce storms nearly destroyed the Harbor Light, and it was replaced by the Table Bluff Light.\n\nThe unimproved state of the mouth of the bay was a crescent-shaped bar covered by a line of breaking waves. The entrance of the bay is protected by two sand spits, named South Spit and North Spit. The bay mouth was stabilized by jetties, with one jetty projecting from each spit. The South Spit jetty was built starting in 1889, but by 1890 observers realized that it had produced erosion of the North Spit and was widening the channel. The jetties are approximately long and apart. Recurring storm damage required rebuilding the jetties in 1911, 1927, 1932, 1939, 1950, 1957, 1963, 1971, 1988 and 1995. Entrance currents are strong, ranging from 2.0 knots average maximum ebb and 1.6 knots average maximum flood; but peak rates can be nearly twice as high.\n\nIn 1971 and 1984, dolosse were added in two layers to secure the jetties, which are maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 1972, 4,796 dolosse were manufactured locally; 4,795 of them are on the jetties, and one was installed outside the Eureka Chamber of Commerce. In 1983, 1,000 more dolosse were made at the South Spit yard and left to cure; local newspapers named the curing site \"Humboldt's Stonehenge.\" In 1985, 450 of the dolosse were shipped around the bay to be placed on the North Spit. At that point, more than $20,000,000 had been spent in total to protect the entrance to Humboldt Bay.\n\nIn 1977 the jetties were named an American Society of Civil Engineers California historical civil engineering landmark. They were designated in 1981 as a national historical civil engineering landmark. The jetties are inspected annually by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 1996, the inspection showed that 34 of the dolosse had cracked, 17 on each jetty, mostly near the southern seaward head.\n\nDredging of channels for shipping began in 1881; periodic dredging of the entrance and shipping channels maintains a depth of . These cumulative changes and water action have resulted in severe erosion at the bay's entrance, where approximately of Buhne Point, which had formerly visually blocked the entrance to the bay, washed away between 1854 and 1955.\n\nMost of the large sloughs around the bay have been protected with levees. But because of development by residents and businesses, of the of historic intertidal marsh, only about 10% remains. Other marsh areas were lost to land reclamation for hay or pasture, and construction of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in 1901. This reduced tidal connectivity along the eastern edge of the bay, which resulted in deterioration of large areas of marsh habitat.\n\nHumboldt Bay and its tidal sloughs are open to fishing year-round. A protected area in the bay is the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge, created in 1971 for the protection and management of wetlands and bay habitats for migratory birds. The Humboldt Botanical Garden, at the College of the Redwoods near the Bay, preserves and displays local native plants. Humboldt Bay is also recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.\n\nIn the winter, the bay serves as a feeding and resting site for more than 100,000 birds. Birds found on the bay include gull species, Caspian tern, brown pelican, cormorant, surf scoter, and common murre.\n\nThe bay is a source of subsistence for a variety of salt-water fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Sport fishing is permitted. Dungeness crab are fished commercially, and oysters are commercially farmed in the bay. The bay supports more than 100 species of marine and estuarine fish, including green sturgeon, coho and Chinook salmon, steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout, which spawn and rear in its watershed, covering an area of . Coho salmon primarily rear and spawn in Elk River, Freshwater Creek, and Jacoby Creek. A recent study found that 40% of coho in the system rear in the estuary. The federally endangered tidewater goby is found in the bay, along with more common three-spined stickleback, shiner perch and Pacific staghorn sculpin.\n\nThe bay has been invaded by the European green crab, a voracious predator that is known to prey on the young of native crab species, as well as native mussels, oysters, and clams. The invasive European green crab were first documented in Humboldt Bay in 1995 and have been blamed for a decline in clam harvesting. Scientists have not found a way to control them.\n\nMarine mammals are represented by harbor porpoises, harbor seal, California sea lion and river otter, with Steller sea lion and gray whale found immediately offshore. Leopard sharks have been reported inside the bay, which also provides habitat for young bat rays, feeding on clams, crabs, shrimps, worms, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, various gastropods and isopods.\n\nAbout 80,000 people reside on the shore of the bay in at least 20 named settlements on the coastal plain around the bay estuary. Most of these are unincorporated suburbs of the City of Eureka.\n\nSettlements located on or near the bay, listed clockwise from the north side of the bay entrance:\n\n\nStreams and sloughs that enter into Humboldt Bay are listed north to south, clockwise, with tributaries entering nearest the bay listed first. The primary streams of major watershed areas east of the bay (draining a combined area of ) are in bold.\n\n\nHumboldt Bay Harbor Recreation and Conservation District is the governing body of Humboldt Bay, the Port of Humboldt Bay, and the Port of Eureka. Despite the jetties and dredging, the harbor entrance remains challenging. Only maritime pilots trained and employed by the district are authorized to bring vessels beyond a certain size into the bay, unless a ship's pilot has proper certification. The Humboldt Bay District maintains a 237-berth marina at Woodley Island, serving both recreational and commercial boats and a shipping dock located in South Bay.\n\nDangerous sand bars and shifting currents have caused many shipwrecks at the entrance to Humboldt Bay, particularly during the late nineteenth century. Forty-two ships were wrecked in and around the channel, most of them while under tow by a piloted tug boat. Fifty-four ships were wrecked on the Humboldt County coastline. Most shipwrecks occurred between 1850 and 1899.\n\nThe Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1971 to conserve and protect a diverse habitat full of mammals, migratory birds, fish, amphibians, and plants. In total, Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge is 3,000 acres including the cities and towns of Loleta, Eureka, and Arcata\n\nHumboldt Bay has many different tributaries, such as a river or stream, flowing into larger rivers or lakes For Humboldt Bay, Salmon Creek is the third largest tributary. Just like the name suggests, Salmon Creek has historically supported large populations of coho salmon, steelhead trout, and chinook salmon. In recent years, the coho salmon population has seen a steady decline in California. Factors such as freshwater habitat degradation, timber harvest activities, and diversion of water for agricultural and municipal purposes influenced coho salmon populations. Historically, Salmon creek consisted of tidal salt marshes with many sloughs mixed in. Due to over grazing, levee construction, and installation of tide gates in the 1900s, Salmon Creek was severely degraded. Humboldt Bay NWR acquired the land in 1988 and deemed Salmon Creek in need of restoration to improve estuarine habitats. Phase 1 of restoration began in 2006 and aimed to increase tidal connectivity, construct new tide gates, and to reconnect several off channel ponds to the stream. Phase 1 improved habitat and slightly increased fish passage, but more restoration was needed. Phase 2 of restoration began by adding 4,200 feet of new estuarine channel and habitat. The estuarine channels were improved by the alignment of slough channels through the original marshes. Lastly, over 200 logs of various sizes were added to the channels and sloughs as hiding and resting areas for marine life. A year after restoration was completed, California Department of Fish and Game conducted a survey and sampled more juvenile coho salmon than the previous year\n\nThe Lanphere Dunes restoration project is considered to be the first of its kind on the west coast. Situated on Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge, the Lanphere Dunes are home to many unique plant and animal species. Restoration efforts began in 1980 to halt the spread of invasive European Beachgrass (\"Ammophilia arenaria\"). Originally inhabited by the Wiyot people, the Lanphere Dunes were under stewardship by new landowners, William and Hortense Lanphere in the 1930s. Along with European Beachgrass, Yellow Bush Lupine (\"Lupinus\" \"arboreus\"), another invasive species, was introduced from an adjacent property nearby. Dune restoration can be quite difficult as all of the plants, animals, and organisms have evolved and co adapted to the specialized costal conditions. Dunes are considered to be a hostile ecosystem because of environmental conditions such as low soil fertility, summer drought, ocean spray, harsh winds, and intense albedo. Due to these conditions, mechanical restoration is best suited for this type of project. Mechanical restoration began by the removal of European Beachgrass by hand or with shovels. Removal of European Beachgrass requires multiple visits over the course of several years due to the plants’ tenacious rhizome. This removal technique also allows for the native vegetation to recolonize at the same rate. The first restoration project started over 40 years ago and to date, native plant and animal communities are thriving.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1987675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987675", "title": "Expedition Everest", "text": "Expedition Everest\n\nExpedition Everest — Legend of the Forbidden Mountain is a steel roller coaster built by Vekoma at Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The ride is themed around the Yeti protecting the Forbidden Mountain next to Mount Everest. The 2011 edition of Guinness World Records lists Expedition Everest as the most expensive roller coaster in the world. Including sets and extras, its total cost was reported to be US$100 million for six years of planning and construction. It held this record up until 2019 when the $300M Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure opened. It is the tallest artificial mountain in all of the Walt Disney Parks and Disney's 18th mountain-themed attraction.\n\nThe attraction was announced publicly on April 22, 2003, during an event to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Disney's Animal Kingdom. Its construction took three years and required more than of rebar; 5,000 tons of structural steel; and 10,000 tons of concrete. Expedition Everest opened for previews on January 26, 2006, and had its grand opening on April 7, 2006, in ceremonies led by Disney CEO Bob Iger and theme parks chairman Jay Rasulo.\n\nThe attraction features a stand-by, Fastpass+, and a single-rider line. The queue starts at the office of the fictional \"Himalayan Escapes\" travel agency, progressing to a replica temple with little holy figures. Visitors next enter a tea garden, followed by a room with equipment from a successful expedition, and then the \"Yeti Museum\", which contains information on the Yeti and a moulding of a Yeti footprint. There are also about 8,000 artifacts brought from the Nepal trip in the museum. The single-rider line skips all of the exhibits.\n\nThe riders board the roller coaster in the model village of Serka Zong, to begin a speedy route through the Himalayas to the base of Mount Everest.\n\nThe train departs the station to the right and climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the lift hill, carrying the riders into the mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At the top of the mountain the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain. It eventually comes to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main drop. It enters a 250° turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is reaching down toward it. On reaching the bottom of this drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. The ride lasts 2 minutes and 50 seconds.\n\nExpedition Everest has six steam-like trains, each with six cars. Each train has 17 rows seating two abreast, for a total of 34 riders per train. The trains are themed as the \"Anandapur Rail Service\" and are made to look old and rusty. Riders must be at least tall and are secured by a lap bar. The \"locomotive\" itself is designed to resemble a vertical boiler configuration and is placed at the rear of the train rather than the front, so not to obstruct the riders' view. Up to five trains usually operate at once, but fewer can be used if guest demand is low. To create the illusion of a \"steam powered\" train, engineers placed vents under the station. When a train comes into the station, steam comes up through the vents and enters the loading platform.\n\nThe steel track is long and the lift is about high. Expedition Everest is the first ride to use Vekoma's newest track system, which places the rails on the outside of the ties rather than on the inside. This was the first large-scale installation of such a system.\n\nAlthough moderate in height and length by contemporary standards, Expedition Everest was the first ride for Disney to have its trains travel both forward and backward. This is accomplished through two sets of track switches, one before the rear segment and one after. This was the second Disney roller coaster to run backwards, the first being Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril: Backwards! at Disneyland Resort Paris (2000–2004). Expedition Everest, however, was the first Disney roller coaster to switch between forward and backward sections during the same ride.\n\nThe mountain façade, the Yeti audio-animatronic, and the roller coaster are three independent structures. Each structure reaches the ground-level and does not touch the other two structures. This was achieved via 4-D scheduling software that told builders how to construct it.\n\nExpedition Everest is often compared to the 1959 Matterhorn Bobsleds roller coaster at Disneyland, which also features a snowy mountain setting and an \"abominable snowman\" figure throughout the ride. Expedition Everest's mountain is made from 1,800 tons of steel and painted with 2,000 gallons of paint. It is the tallest artificial mountain in the world, but not, as occasionally cited, the tallest point in Florida. It is Disney's 18th mountain-themed attraction.\n\nThe artificial mountain is not a model of Mount Everest, but rather of the fictional \"forbidden mountain\" guarded by the yeti in the story created for the attraction by Walt Disney Imagineering. Everest is represented by the barren background peak on the far right, which is made to seem far in the distance (an example of forced perspective).\n\nThe yeti is the largest and most complex audio-animatronic figure ever built by Walt Disney Imagineering. It is tall. Its \"skin\" measures , and is held in place by 1,000 snaps and 250 zippers. Its movement is controlled by 19 actuators when functioning in \"A-mode\", its full mode of operation. In \"A-mode,\" it can move horizontally and vertically. The yeti's roars are provided by voice actor Fred Tatasciore.\n\nA few months after the ride opened in 2006, the yeti figure's framing split, threatening catastrophic malfunction if it were to be operated further in \"A-mode\". Since then it has been operated only in the alternative \"B-mode\", in which a strobe-light effect is used to give the appearance of movement, earning it the nickname \"Disco Yeti\" from some fans. It is speculated that the problem was caused by damage to the yeti's concrete base structure, which is unlikely to be repaired until a major refurbishment in the distant future, because the design limits access to the yeti without major disassembly of the superstructure. The problem with the concrete is rumored to have occurred due to a glitch in the 4-D scheduling software that prevented adequate curing of a portion of the Yeti's foundation before the fabrication of mountain elements and roller coaster track.\n\nJoe Rohde, the Imagineer in charge of building the attraction and Animal Kingdom, was asked about the yeti at the 2013 D23 Expo. Rohde responded, \"You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower in the middle of a finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but we are working on it. And we continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them quite get to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but we are working on it... I will fix the Yeti someday, I swear.\"\n\nIn 2005, Disney, Discovery Networks, and Conservation International conducted expeditions to Nepal as part of the promotion for Expedition Everest. The purpose was to conduct scientific and cultural research in remote areas of the Himalayas, the location of the yeti legend. Participants included Joe Rohde from Walt Disney Imagineering and scientists from Conservation International and Disney's Animal Kingdom.\n\nThe expeditions and the making of the attraction were chronicled in three documentaries broadcast on Discovery's cable television channels in April 2006. The first was \"Expedition Everest: Journey to Sacred Lands\", broadcast on the Travel Channel on April 9 to coincide with the attraction's grand opening. The second, \"Building A Thrill Ride: Expedition Everest\", was aired on April 10 and detailed the planning and construction of the ride, along with some of the ideas that made it possible. (During construction, for example, instead of traditional scaffolding the Imagineers used interior poles that poked through the outside of the mountain and were connected by wooden platforms.) This documentary also featured survival tips from Les Stroud. The third, \"Corwin's Quest: Realm of the Yeti\", was broadcast on Animal Planet on April 15 and featured American animal and nature conservationist Jeff Corwin.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, Disney staged an elaborate publicity stunt called \"Everest in the City\" in New York City's Times Square. They draped large billboards over the sides of several buildings, depicting Everest with a coaster car careening down the mountainside and the yeti looking on from another peak, its eyes glowing red and flashing when the text message \"Disney” was sent to “4Yeti” as provided by Disney.\n\nOn December 18, 2007, a 44-year-old guest was found unconscious after the train returned to the station. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A preliminary autopsy by the Orange County medical examiner's office concluded that the victim had died of dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe 2011 book of Guinness World Records lists Expedition Everest as the most expensive roller coaster in the world. Including sets and extras, the total cost of the ride was reported to be US$100 million over six years of planning and construction.\n\nExpedition Everest won the 2006 Theme Park Insider Award for the \"World's Best New Theme Park Attraction\". It has also been ranked in the Golden Ticket Awards and the Best Roller Coaster Poll. It was ranked 2nd for \"Best New Ride For 2006\" in the Golden Ticket Awards.\n\n\n"}

Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Prewitt operator is either the corresponding gradient vector or the norm of this vector. The Prewitt operator is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer valued filter in horizontal and vertical directions and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations like Sobel and Kayyali operators. On the other hand, the gradient approximation which it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high frequency variations in the image. The Prewitt operator was developed by Judith M. S. Prewitt.\n\nIn simple terms, the operator calculates the \"gradient\" of the image intensity at each point, giving the direction of the largest possible increase from light to dark and the rate of change in that direction. The result therefore shows how \"abruptly\" or \"smoothly\" the image changes at that point, and therefore how likely it is that part of the image represents an \"edge\", as well as how that edge is likely to be oriented. In practice, the magnitude (likelihood of an edge) calculation is more reliable and easier to interpret than the direction calculation.\n\nMathematically, the gradient of a two-variable function (here the image intensity function) is at each image point a 2D vector with the components given by the derivatives in the horizontal and vertical directions. At each image point, the gradient vector points in the direction of largest possible intensity increase, and the length of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change in that direction. This implies that the result of the Prewitt operator at an image point which is in a region of constant image intensity is a zero vector and at a point on an edge is a vector which points across the edge, from darker to brighter values.\n\nMathematically, the operator uses two 3×3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate approximations of the derivatives - one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical. If we define formula_1 as the source image, and formula_2 and formula_3 are two images which at each point contain the horizontal and vertical derivative approximations, the latter are computed as:\n\nwhere formula_5 here denotes the 2-dimensional convolution operation.\n\nSince the Prewitt kernels can be decomposed as the products of an averaging and a differentiation\nkernel, they compute the gradient with smoothing. Therefore, it is a separable filter. For example, formula_2 can be written as\n\nThe \"x\"-coordinate is defined here as increasing in the \"left\"-direction, and the \"y\"-coordinate is defined as increasing in the \"up\"-direction. At each point in the image, the resulting gradient approximations can be combined to give the gradient magnitude, using:\n\nUsing this information, we can also calculate the gradient's direction:\nwhere, for example, Θ is 0 for a vertical edge which is darker on the right side.\n\n"}

It breeds in much of northern South America from Panama and Trinidad south to Peru, Bolivia and central Brazil. However, they have been sighted as far north as Nayarit state in Mexico.\n\nThe male is on average long and weighs about , with the female long and weighing approximately . The yellow-rumped cacique is a slim bird, with a long tail, blue eyes, and a pale yellow pointed bill. It has mainly black plumage, apart from a bright yellow rump, tail base, lower belly and wing \"epaulets\". The female is duller black than the male, and the juvenile bird resembles the female, but has dark eyes and a brown bill base.\n\nThe song of the male yellow-rumped cacique is a brilliant mixture of fluting notes with cackles, wheezes and sometimes mimicry. There are also many varied calls, and an active colony can be heard from a considerable distance.\n\nIt has three subspecies:\n\nThe latter two may be a separate species, saffron-rumped cacique.\n\nThe yellow-rumped cacique is a bird associated with open woodland or cultivation with large trees. This gregarious bird eats large insects and fruit.\n\nIt is a colonial breeder, with up to 100 bag-shaped nests in a tree, which usually also contains an active wasp nest. The females build the nests, incubate, and care for the young. Each nest is 30–45 cm long and widens at the base, and is suspended from the end of a branch. Females compete for the best sites near the protection of the wasp nest. The normal clutch is two dark-blotched pale blue or white eggs. Females begin incubating after laying the second egg; hatching occurs after 13 or 14 days. The young fledge in 34 to 40 days, usually only one per nest.\n\nThe yellow-rumped cacique has benefited from the more open habitat created by forest clearance and ranching. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.\n\nIn Peruvian folklore, this species – like other caciques and oropendolas – is called \"paucar\", or – referring to this species only – paucarcillo (\"little \"paucar\"\"). This species is apparently the \"paucar\" that, according to a folktale of Moyobamba, originated as a rumor-mongering boy who always wore black pants and a yellow jacket. When he spread an accusation against an old woman who was a fairy in disguise, she turned him into a noisy, wandering bird. The bird's appearance is thought to augur good news.\n\n\n\n"}

The work describes the work and life of Pierce Moffett, who prepares a manuscript for publication even as it prepares him for some as-yet unknown destiny, all set amidst strange and subtle Hermetic manipulations among the Faraway Hills at the border of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe four volumes mingle Moffett's real and dream life in America in 1977 (and, in an extended coda, into the early 1980s) with the narrative of the manuscript he is preparing for publication. Another manuscript, left unfinished by its author Fellowes Kraft and discovered by Moffett, is an historical fiction that follows the briefly intersecting adventures of Italian heretic Giordano Bruno and of British occultists John Dee and Edward Kelley.\n\nMoffett is trained as a historian, and is under contract to write a popular history covering hermetical themes. Early in the process, he conceives of writing a novel which, it is clear, would be \"Ægypt\"; his ruminations on that novel describe the structure of the novel he is in. The distinctions between Crowley's, Moffett's, and Kraft's books are continually elided and the three books are finally undifferentiated.\n\nThe novels generally have three main \"strands\" reflecting on three main characters, one occurring in the present day generally following Pierce or Rosie Mucho in their artistic works, and two occurring in the Renaissance following the fictionalized historical activities of John Dee, Edward Kelley and Giordano Bruno as written by Fellowes Kraft. The difference is marked stylistically by dashes indicating dialogue for events that happened in the Renaissance and events in the twentieth century marked by dialogue in ordinary English quotation marks.\n\nThe titles of the first three volumes in the sequence are tributes to Renaissance literary works; and in many cases the nature of these works redound on the action of these three novels themselves:\n\n\nThe sequence is organized around the 12 astrological houses, with each book divided into three parts, each bearing a Latin name of the corresponding house. \"The Solitudes\"' parts, for example, are called \"Vita\", \"Lucrum\" and \"Fratres\", the Latin names for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses. The content of each part bears some relationship to the traditional associations of the house in question. The four volumes themselves correspond to the four seasons, starting with spring and ending in winter.\n\nHarold Bloom has praised the first three books in the sequence, installing the first two in his 1993 list of the Western canon. Michael Dirda, asked in 2007 what his favorite recent book was, named \"the four-part sequence by John Crowley called 'Aegypt.'\" On reviewing the completed sequence in 2008, Dirda declared that the four novels together \"confirms that he is one of our finest living writers, period.\" In an appreciation of Crowley's \"Little, Big\" in 2000, James Hynes called the then-unfinished sequence \"an astonishing accomplishment\" comparing it to works by Robertson Davies and Thomas Mann.\n\nTerri Windling selected \"Love and Sleep\" as one of the best fantasy books of 1994, saying \"his growing story is a masterpiece.\"\n\n\n"}

In 1946, he became the first black South African to receive a Ph.D. Vilakazi Street in Soweto is named after him and it is now famous as the place where both Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu once lived.\n\nBenedict Vilakazi was born Bambatha kaMshini in 1906 at the Groutville Mission Station near KwaDukuza, Natal (now South Africa), the fifth child of Christian converts Mshini ka Makhwatha and Leah Hlongwane: Mrs Leah Hlongwane Vilakazi, the daughter of Bangile who was the sister of Queen Ngqambuza, wife to Mpande ka Cetshwayo, and also the sister of the Right Reverend J Mdelwa Hlongwane ka Mnyaziwezulu, the son of Chief Matiwane. \n\nVilakazi split his childhood between herding the family cattle and the local mission school until the age of 10, at which point he transferred to the St. Francis College in Mariannhill, a coeducational Roman Catholic secondary school founded by the local Trappist monastery. Here he was baptized with the name \"Benedict Wallet,\" though at his mother's insistence he kept the family name of Vilakazi. He obtained a teaching certificate in 1923 and taught at Mariannhill and later at a seminary in Ixopo.\n\nIn 1933, Vilakazi released his first novel \"Nje nempela\" (\"Really and Truly\"), one of the first works of Zulu fiction to treat modern subject matter. He followed it in 1935 with the novel \"Noma nini\" as well as a poetry collection \"Inkondlo kaZulu\", the first publication of Western-influenced Zulu poetry.\n\nEarning a B.A. from the University of South Africa in 1934, Vilakazi began work in the Bantu studies department at the University of Witwatersrand in 1936 under linguist C. M. Doke, with whom he created a Zulu-English dictionary. Vilakazi's teaching position made him the first black South African to teach white South Africans at the university level.\n\nVilakazi's later novels continued to explore daily Zulu life, such as \"UDingiswayo kaJobe\" (1939) and \"Nje nempela\" (1944), the story of a traditionally polygamous household. His poetry, heavily influenced by European Romantic styles, fused rhyme and stanza forms previously unknown in Zulu with elements of the \"izibongo\", traditional praise poetry. His poetry became increasingly political in the course of his life, dramatizing the exploitation of not only the Zulus but of black Africans generally. Both his novels and poetry were well received in his own lifetime and remain so today.\n\nVilakazi is also noted for his scholarly work on oral tradition and the Zulu and Xhosa languages, which on 16 March 1946, earned him the first Ph.D. to be won by a black South African.\n\nA year after receiving his doctorate, Benedict Wallet Vilakazi died in Johannesburg of meningitis.\n\nOn 28 April 2016, the Order of Ikhamanga - Gold (OIG) was conferred on Dr Benedict Wallet Vilakazi posthumously‚ for \"his exceptional contribution to the field of literature in indigenous languages and the preservation of isiZulu culture\".\n\nVilakazi Street in Soweto is the only street in the world where two Nobel Laureates once lived.

Examples of these databases include Ovid Technologies, Web of Science, Chemical Abstracts Service, Modern Language Association and Google Scholar.\n\nThe National Information Standards Organization has developed standards for OpenURL and its data container as American National Standards Institute standard ANSI/NISO Z39.88-2004. OpenURL standards create a clear structure for links that go from information resource databases (sources) to library services (targets). \n\nA target is a resource or service that helps satisfy a user's information needs. Examples of targets include full-text repositories, online journals, online library catalogs and other Web resources and services. OpenURL knowledge bases provide links to the appropriate targets available.\n\nOpenURL was created by Herbert Van de Sompel, a librarian at the University of Ghent, in the late 1990s. His link-server software, SFX, was purchased by the library automation company Ex Libris Group which popularized OpenURL in the information industry.\n\nIn 2005, a revised version of OpenURL (version 1.0) became ANSI/NISO standard Z39.88-2004, with Van de Sompel's version designated as version 0.1.\nThe new standard provided a framework for describing new formats, as well as defining XML versions of the various formats.\nThe Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) was named the maintenance agency for the standard on 22 June 2006.\n\nIn 2006 a research report found some problems affecting the efficiency of OpenURL linking and recommended the creation of a group to establish best practice solutions. The KBART (Knowledge Bases And Related Tools) working group has been set up to progress the recommendations of the research report. OpenURL standards and reporting work continues with NISO's IOTA (Improving OpenURLs Through Analytics) project, which produced a reporting tool and research summary in 2013 noting the benefits of data analysis to improve link resolution.\n\nThe most common application of OpenURL is to assist in the resolution of a request for a web resource (such as an online article). An OpenURL includes information about the referenced resource itself, and context information — both the context in which the OpenURL occurs (for example, a page of search results from a library catalog) and the context of the request (for example, the particular user making the request). If a different context is expressed in the URL, a different copy ends up resolved to. Changes in context are predictable, and do not require the original creator of the hyperlink (for example, the journal publisher) to handcraft different URLs for different contexts.\n\nFor example, changing either the base URL or a parameter in the query string can mean that the OpenURL resolves to a copy of a resource in a different library. So the same OpenURL, contained for instance in an electronic journal, can be adjusted by any library to provide access to their own copy of the resource, without completely overwriting the journal's hyperlink. The journal provider, in turn, is no longer required to provide a different version of the journal, with different hyperlinks, for each subscribing library (See also COinS).\n\nAn OpenURL consists of a base URL, which contains the address of the user's institutional link-server, followed by a query string, consisting of key-value pairs serializing a \"ContextObject\". The ContextObject is most often bibliographic data, but as of version 1.0 OpenURL can also include information about the requester, the resource containing the hyperlink, the type of service required, and so forth. For example:\n\nis a version 0.1 OpenURL describing a book.\ncodice_2 is the base URL of an example link-server.\n\nIn version 1.0, this same link becomes somewhat longer:\n\nThe above query string consists of the following key-value pairs:\nKeys always consist of safe characters and are not encoded, but values are URL-encoded.\n\nSeveral companies market link server systems. Some proprietary options include OCLC (as part of WorldCat Local), Ex Libris (SFX and Alma UResolver), Serials Solutions (360 Link, formerly known as Article Linker), Innovative Interfaces, Inc. (WebBridge), EBSCO Information Services (Full Text Finder), Ovid (LinkSolver), SirsiDynix (Resolver), Fretwell-Downing (OL2), TDNet, Inc. (TOUResolver), WT Cox Information Services (Journal Finder), R.R. Bowker (Ulrichs Resource Linker) and Infor (Vlink).\n\nOpen-source link resolvers include CUFTS and Umlaut. There are also open-source tools for manipulating OpenURLs and the Code4Lib community maintains a list of these.\n\nOpenURL is usually implemented by information providers by dynamically inserting an appropriate base URL into web pages sent to an authenticated user. OpenURL COinS is a specification that allows free services like Wikipedia to provide OpenURLs by cooperating with client side software agents. Federated search software presents OpenURL links in record fields by employing the library's subscriber links to link servers facilitating access to full-text resources from bibliographic record hyperlinks.\n\n\n"}

The route is a nominally east–west freeway for its entire length, and less commonly known as the Blue Star Memorial Highway. An eastward continuation of Interstate 495, Route 25 provides freeway access to Cape Cod. The route's western terminus is at a trumpet interchange with I-495 and I-195 in Wareham. The route has three numbered interchanges along its length before terminating at the northern end of the Bourne Bridge in Bourne; the mainline of Route 25 continues across the bridge and over the Cape Cod Canal as Massachusetts Route 28 south.\n\nPrior to 1982, the Route 25 designation was given to that segment of what is now I-495 from Route 24 in Raynham to the interchange with I-195 in Wareham. Upon completion of the I-495 segment between Route 24 and I-95, that portion of the existing freeway was redesignated as I-495 in various stages during the 1970s and 1980s, eventually reducing Route 25 to a segment that continued eastward from I-495 to the modern location of Exit 2 in Downtown Wareham. Construction of an eastern continuation of Route 25 to the Bourne Bridge was delayed for nearly three decades due to property disputes and environmental concerns, but the final segment opened in 1987. The freeway was originally planned to continue over the Bourne Bridge into Cape Cod as part of the Southside Connector, but this plan was abandoned by the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) in the late 1970s.\n\nRoute 25 begins at a trumpet interchange with I-495 and I-195 in Wareham, Massachusetts; the two left lanes of Route 25 west mainline onto Route 495 north, with the right-hand lane serving I-195 via Exit 1. From I-195, Route 25 east is accessible via Exit 22A; I-195 terminates at the interchange. Interstate 495 also terminates at its junction with Route 25; the two southbound lanes of I-495 default onto Route 25 east. After the interchange with I-195 and I-495, Route 25 begins to head in a southeastern direction into the town of Wareham as a six-lane freeway. The route passes under Tihonet Road and through Maple Swamp, located at the northern end of Parker Mills Pond.\n\nAfter the Tihonet Road overpass, the route continues on a southeastern projection, passing close to several farms and cranberry bogs in Wareham. After passing under Charge Pond Road, Route 25 enters a densely populated region of Wareham with an alignment parallel to Route 28 (Cranberry Highway). Eastbound Route 25 has its first interchange with Maple Springs Road, a local road that connects to US 6 and Route 28 and is used to access Wareham and the village of Onset. Shortly after the interchange, numbered as Exit 2 (formerly Exit 1), Route 25 proceeds across Agawam Mill Pond via a short causeway. Exit 2 off Route 25 west is located to the east of Agawam Mill Pond and connects to US 6 and Route 28 via Glen Charlie Road, an unnumbered route that also serves the village of White Island Shores.\nAfter Exit 2, Route 25 bends to the northeast, bypassing Buttermilk Bay and the densely populated village of Buzzards Bay to the south. The route passes Union Pond and Dicks Pond to the south and Spectacle Pond and Sandy Pond to the north before entering the town of Plymouth. In Plymouth, Route 25 passes to the north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds. While the freeway has no interchanges in Plymouth, a rest area is located off eastbound Route 25 in the town; the area is inaccessible from westbound Route 25. Due to state funding cutbacks, services at the rest area are limited to summer weekends (Friday to Sunday) as of 2010. After the rest area, Route 25 passes over Bourne Road and turns sharply to head in a southwestern direction. The route passes under Bournedale Road after entering the town of Bourne. In Bourne, Route 25 has its final interchange; Exit 3 (formerly Exit 2) serves the villages of Buzzards Bay and Sagamore, connecting to US 6 (Scenic Highway) and Route 28 north. From Exit 3, US 6 is used to access the Sagamore Bridge in northern Bourne and the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown on Cape Cod.\n\nAfter Exit 3, the Route 25 designation continues for . The six-lane freeway narrows into a four-lane undivided highway shortly before the approach ramps to the Bourne Bridge. Route 25 is concurrent with Route 28 from Exit 3 until the US 6 underpass, at which point the Route 25 designation officially ends; the two eastbound lanes of Route 25 continue as Route 28 south over the Bourne Bridge and the Cape Cod Canal and onto Cape Cod. Route 28 continues southward to the town of Falmouth and then eastward to Hyannis and Orleans. An estimated daily average of over 35,000 motorists utilized the Route 25 expressway in 2008.\n\nThe origins of Route 25 date back to 1947, when the Massachusetts Department of Public Works (MassDPW) announced plans for an expressway that would link I-95 in Foxborough with Cape Cod. The planned route was given the Route 25 designation northwest of a planned interchange with the Fall River Expressway (Route 24) in Raynham and the Route 28 designation to the southeast of Route 24. After ten years of planning studies, the route received preliminary approval from the MassDPW in 1957, and construction began in 1958; the entire route was designated as Route 25 in 1962, with Route 28 instead being aligned on local roads. The portion of the freeway between Route 24 in Raynham and I-195 in Wareham was completed in 1967. In 1969, MassDPW extended the freeway eastward to US 6 in Wareham.\n\nIn the 1970s, the MassDPW changed the planned designation of the unconstructed Route 25 expressway northwest of Route 24 to I-495. When this portion of I-495 was completed in 1982, the state also designated the existing alignment of Route 25 between Route 24 and the I-195 interchange in Wareham as I-495. After the reassignment, Route 25 was shortened to a stretch from I-195 east to Downtown Wareham.\n\nFrom 1969 until 1987, the eastern terminus of Route 25 was at a junction with Maple Springs Road, US 6 and Route 28 in Wareham near the modern location of Exit 2. The MassDPW and the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) had plans to extend the freeway eastward to Cape Cod as early as 1953, when the route was included in the proposed Cape Cod Expressway that would connect New York City with Cape Cod. Route 25 was originally planned to connect to the Sagamore Bridge, which carried US 6 over the Cape Cod Canal and was used to access the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown. In 1962, however, the MassDPW conducted traffic studies on the two bridges crossing the canal and found that the Sagamore Bridge was above vehicular capacity, whereas the more southern Bourne Bridge had excess capacity. The Route 25 freeway was then redesigned to cross over the Bourne Bridge and connect with the Mid-Cape Highway (US 6) on the southern side of the canal via the proposed Southside Connector. The connector would have been constructed through the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Bourne, but was canceled by the MassDPW and MassHighway in 1977 when environmental tests indicated the freeway would disturb underground aquifers serving as water sources for the region. MassDPW instead changed the proposed eastern terminus of the Route 25 expressway to the approach ramps of the Bourne Bridge.\n\nConstruction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, was delayed for nearly three decades to property disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land where much of the state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used along the length of the freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.\n\nThe freeway was also delayed due to a larger property dispute with Hope Ingersoll, the owner of the Grazing Fields Farm on Bournedale Road in Bourne, well known in the region as an artists' colony and a producer of organic food. MassDPW proposed constructing Route 25 through the center of the farm, but Ingersoll hired engineers to develop an alternate routing. In 1978, MassDPW rejected Ingersoll's design, instead approving the alignment that ran through farmland seized by eminent domain. In 1980, a state judge ruled that MassDPW had to conduct environmental studies on both the original routing and Ingersoll's proposal. MassDPW eventually opted to construct Ingersoll's design, giving Route 25 a longer alignment that arced to the north and east of Grazing Fields Farm before turning westward toward the Buzzards Bay business district and the Bourne Bridge. The route finally began construction in 1982, and in 1989 the MassDPW was forced to pay Ingersoll $2.6 million (1982 USD) for of farmland seized for the expressway's construction.\n\nIn 1987, the final segment of Route 25 from Maple Springs Road in Wareham to the Bourne Bridge was completed. A rest area and information center in Plymouth also opened with the freeway. The new expressway relieved congestion along US 6 and Route 28 in the Buzzards Bay business district, greatly reducing the number of accidents along the approach to the Bourne Bridge. In 2007, MassHighway completed a renumbering of the three interchanges along the length of Route 25 as part of a signing upgrade project. Previously, the I-195 interchange had been numbered Exit 1 as part of I-495's numbering scheme, with the Onset interchange also being Exit 1 as part of Route 25's own scheme. This led to a confusing situation in which the road had two consecutive Exit 1s, so MassHighway devised a solution in which I-495 and MA-25 would \"share\" Exit 1 (the I-195 interchange), and all other exits on MA-25 would be bumped up a number. Due to the previous confusion, and despite the solution, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) has enacted a proposition which would have MA-25 cease to exist and be replaced by I-495, but has yet to implement the plan, which has been postponed indefinitely.\n\nAll interchanges were to be renumbered to mileage-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016. The proposed new numbers from west to east are 1, 3, & 10. However, this project was indefinitely postponed by the MassDOT until on November 18, 2019, the MassDOT confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020, the exit renumbering project will begin.\n\n\n"}

Specific objectives were to collect data on sea-surface winds, sea-surface temperatures, wave heights, internal waves, atmospheric water, sea ice features and ocean topography. Seasat was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was launched on 27 June 1978 into a nearly circular orbit with an inclination of 108°. Seasat operated until 10 October 1978 (UTC), when a massive short circuit in the Agena-D bus electrical system ended the mission.\n\nSeasat carried five major instruments designed to return the maximum information from ocean surfaces:\n\nMany later remote sensing missions benefited from Seasat's legacy.

{"id": "1987761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1987761", "title": "Leedsichthys", "text": "Leedsichthys\n\nLeedsichthys is a giant member of the Pachycormidae, an extinct group of Mesozoic ray-finned fish that lived in the oceans of the Middle Jurassic period.\n\nThe first remains of \"Leedsichthys\" were identified in the nineteenth century. Especially important were the finds by the British collector Alfred Nicholson Leeds, after whom the genus was named \"Leeds' fish\" in 1889. The type species is \"Leedsichthys problematicus\". \"Leedsichthys\" fossils have been found in England, France, Germany and Chile. In 1999, based on the Chilean discoveries, a second species was named \"Leedsichthys notocetes\", but this was later shown to be indistinguishable from \"L. problematicus\".\n\n\"Leedsichthys\" fossils have been difficult to interpret because the skeletons were not completely made of bone. Large parts consisted of cartilage that did not fossilize. On several occasions the enigmatic large partial remains have been mistaken for stegosaurian dinosaur bones. As the vertebrae are among the parts that have not been preserved, it is hard to determine the total body length. Estimates have varied significantly. At the beginning of the twentieth century a length of nine metres (thirty feet) was seen as plausible, but by its end \"Leedsichthys\" was sometimes claimed to have been over thirty metres (hundred feet) long. Recent research has lowered this to about sixteen metres (fifty feet) for the largest individuals. Skull bones have been found indicating that \"Leedsichthys\" had a large head with bosses on the skull roof. Fossilised bony fin rays show large elongated pectoral fins and a tall vertical tail fin. The gill arches were lined by gill rakers, equipped by a unique system of delicate bone plates, that filtered plankton from the sea water, the main food source.\n\nAlong with its close pachycormid relatives \"Bonnerichthys\" and \"Rhinconichthys\", \"Leedsichthys\" is part of a lineage of large-sized filter-feeders that swam the Mesozoic seas for over 100 million years, from the middle Jurassic until the end of the Cretaceous period. Pachycormids might represent an early branch of Teleostei, the group most modern bony fishes belong to; in that case \"Leedsichthys\" is the largest known teleost fish.\n\nDuring the 1880s, the gentleman farmer Alfred Nicholson Leeds collected large fish fossils from loam pits near Peterborough, England. In May 1886 these were inspected by John Whitaker Hulke, who in 1887 partially reported them as the back plates of the stegosaurian \"Omosaurus\". On 22 August 1888, the American dinosaur expert Professor Othniel Charles Marsh visited Leeds' farm at Eyebury and quickly concluded that the presumed dinosaurian armour in fact represented the skull bones of a giant fish. Within two weeks British fish expert Arthur Smith Woodward examined the specimens and began to prepare a formal description published in 1889. In it he named the species \"Leedsichthys problematicus\". The generic name \"Leedsichthys\" means \"Leeds' fish\", from Greek ἰχθύς, \"ichthys\", \"fish\". The fossils found by Leeds gave the fish the specific epithet \"problematicus\" because the remains were so fragmented that they were extremely hard to recognize and interpret. After a second publication in 1889, objections were raised against the perceived \"barbaric\" nature of the generic name, which simply attached a non-Latinised British family name to a Classical Greek word. Woodward therefore in 1890 changed the genus name to \"Leedsia\", resulting in a \"Leedsia problematica\". However, by modern standards this is a non-valid junior synonym.\n\nThe holotype specimen, BMNH P.6921, had been found in a layer of the Oxford Clay Formation dating from the Callovian, about 165 million years old. It consists of 1133 disarticulated elements of the skeleton, mostly fin ray fragments, probably of a single individual. Another specimen, BMNH P.6922, contains additional probable fragmentary remains of \"Leedsichthys\". Woodward also identified a specimen previously acquired from the French collector Tesson, who had in 1857 found them in the Falaises des Vaches Noires of Normandy, BMNH 32581, as the gill rakers of \"Leedsichthys\". Another specimen bought in 1875 from the collection of William Cunnington, BMNH 46355, he failed to recognise.\n\nLeeds continued to collect \"Leedsichthys\" fossils that subsequently were acquired by British musea. In March 1898, Leeds reported to have discovered a tail which he on 17 March 1899 sold for £25 to the British Museum of Natural History, which exhibited it as specimen BMNH P.10000; a new inventory number range was begun for the occasion. Already in July 1898, the front of probably the same animal had been bought, BMNH P.11823. On 22 July 1905 specimen BMNH P.10156 was acquired, a gill basket. In January 1915 Leeds sold specimens GLAHM V3362, a pectoral fin, and GLAHM V3363, the remainder of the same skeleton with 904 elements, to the Hunterian Museum of Glasgow.\n\nLeeds had a rival, the collector Henry Keeping, who in 1899 tricked pit workers into selling dorsal fin rays by misinforming them that Leeds had lost interest in such finds. Keeping again sold these to the University of Cambridge where they were catalogued as specimen CAMSM J.46873. In September 1901, they were examined by the German palaeontologist Friedrich von Huene, who identified them as tail spikes, \"Schwanzstacheln\", of \"Omosaurus\", the second time \"Leedsichthys\" remains were mistaken for stegosaurian bones; Leeds himself was able to disabuse von Huene the same year.\n\nIn 2001, students at the Dogsthorpe Star Pit discovered a major new British specimen that they nicknamed \"Ariston\" after a 1991 commercial for the Indesit Ariston washing machine that claimed it went \"on and on and on\" — likewise the bones of \"Leedsichthys\" seemed to endlessly continue into the face of the loam pit. From 2002 until 2004 \"Ariston\" or specimen PETMG F174 was excavated by a team headed by Jeff Liston; to uncover the remains it was necessary to remove ten thousand tonnes of loam forming an overburden of 15 metres (49 feet) thickness. The find generated considerable media attention, inspiring an episode of the BBC \"Sea Monsters\" series, \"The Second Most Deadly Sea\", and a Channel Four documentary titled \"The Big Monster Dig\", both containing computer-generated animated reconstructions of \"Leedsichthys\". Liston subsequently dedicated a dissertation and a series of articles to \"Leedsichthys\", providing the first extensive modern osteology of the animal.\n\nApart from the British discoveries, finds of a more fragmentary nature continued to be made in Normandy, France. In July 1982, Germany became an important source of \"Leedsichthys\" fossils when two groups of amateur palaeontologists, unaware of each other's activities, began to dig up the same skeleton at Wallücke. Remarkably, parts of it were again incorrectly identified as stegosaurian material, of \"Lexovisaurus\". From 1973 onwards, fragmentary \"Leedsichthys\" fossils were uncovered in Chile. In March 1994, a more complete specimen was found, SMNK 2573 PAL. In 1999 the Chilean finds were named as a second species, \"Leedsichthys notocetes\", the \"Southern Sea Monster\". However, Liston later concluded that the presumed distinguishing traits of this species, depressions on the gill rakers, were artefacts caused by erosion; \"Leedsichthys notocetes\" would be a junior synonym of \"Leedsichthys problematicus\".\n\nThe fossil remains of \"Leedsichthys\" have been found in the Callovian of England and northern Germany, the Oxfordian of Chile, and the Callovian and upper Kimmeridgian of France. These occurrences span a temporal range of at least five million years. A complete and isolated gill raker from the Vaca Muerta formation of Argentina (MOZ-Pv 1788), has been assigned to the genus and dates to the early Tithonian.\n\nAlthough the remains of over seventy individuals have been found, most of them are partial and fragmentary. The skeleton of \"Leedsichthys\" is thus only imperfectly known. This is largely caused by the fact that many skeletal elements, including the front of the skull and the vertebral centra, did not ossify but remained cartilage. Furthermore, those that did ossify were gradually hollowed out during the lifetime of the animal by resorption of the inner bone tissue. In the fossil phase, compression flattened and cracked these hollow structures, making it extraordinarily difficult to identify them or determine their original form.\n\nThe head was probably relatively large and wide but still elongated. The snout is completely unknown. Frontal bones are absent. The skull roof is rather robust with bosses on the parietals, continuing sideways over the dermopterotica, and the postparietals. The parietals have a notch on the front midline. A dermosphenoticum is present above the eye socket. The jaws are toothless. Behind the jaw joint a robust hyomandibula is present. The gill basket rests on paired hypohyalia. At least the first two gill arches have ossified hypobranchialia, the lower parts of the gill arch; a third hypobranchiale was likely present. The hypobranchials are attached at their lower ends at an angle of 21,5° via a functional joint that possibly served to increase the gape of the mouth, to about two feet. All five gill arches have ossified ceratobranchialia with a triangular cross-section, the middle sections of the arches. The hypobranchials are fused with their ceratobranchials. The fifth gill arch is fused with the front parts of the basket. Higher epibranchialia and pharyngobranchialia are present but poorly known. The fourth arches are supported by a midline fourth basibranchiale. An ossified operculum is present.\n\nThe gill arches are equipped with rows of parallel 3-to-12-centimetre-long (1.2-to-4.7-inch-long) gill rakers, in life probably attached to the ceratobranchials via soft tissue. On the top of each raker one or two rows of dozens of low \"teeth\" are present. When there are two rows, they are placed on the edges of the upper surface and separated by a deep trough, itself separated from an internal hollow space by a transverse septum. The teeth or \"fimbriations\" are obliquely directed towards the front and the top. They are grooved at their sides, the striations continuing over the sides of the raker. Detailed study of exquisitely preserved French specimens revealed to Liston that these teeth were, again via soft tissue, each attached to delicate 2-millimetre-long (0.08-inch-long) bony plates, structures that had never before been observed among living or extinct fishes. An earlier hypothesis that the striations would function as sockets for sharp \"needle teeth\", as with the basking shark, was hereby refuted. The rakers served to filter plankton, the main food supply of \"Leedsichthys\", from the sea water.\n\nLarge parts of the \"Leedsichthys\" fossils consist of bony finrays. \"Leedsichthys\" has two pectoral fins that probably were located rather low on the body. They are large, very elongated — about five times longer than wide — and scythe-like, with a sudden kink at the lower end, curving 10° to the rear. Also a dorsal fin is present, although its position is unknown. Pelvic fins at the belly are lacking; also a pelvic plate is absent. However, there are indications for a small triangular anal fin. The vertical tail fin is very large and symmetrical with paired upper and lower lobes; there is a smaller lobe in the middle protruding between them. The rays are unsegmented lepidotrichia, resulting in a rather stiff structure. They are bifurcated at up to three splitting points along their length, so a proximally single ray may have eight distal ends. A row of bony supraneuralia is present behind the head, at each side of the vertebral column. Uroneuralia at the tail are unknown. No bony scales are present.\n\n\"Leedsichthys\" is the largest known member of the Osteichthyes or bony fishes, with the exception of the largest descendants of land-dwelling Tetrapodomorpha (e.g. giant sauropods and whales), not commonly thought of as \"fishes\". The largest extant non-tetrapodomorph bony fish is the ocean sunfish, \"Mola mola\", being with a weight of up to two tonnes an order of magnitude smaller than \"Leedsichthys\". The extant King of Herrings might rival \"Leedsichthys\" in length but is a much more elongated animal. The lack of a preserved vertebral column has made it difficult to estimate the exact length of \"Leedsichthys\". Arthur Smith Woodward, who described the type specimen in 1889, estimated specimen BMNH P.10000 to be of an around nine metre long individual, by comparing this tail of \"Leedsichthys\", having a preserved height of 274 centimetres (108 inches), with another pachycormid, \"Hypsocormus\". The length of \"Leedsichthys\" was not historically the subject of much attention, the only reference to it being made by Woodward himself when he in 1937 indicated it again as 9 metres (29.5 feet) on the museum label of BMNH P.10000. However, in 1986, David Martill compared the bones of \"Leedsichthys\" to a pachycormid that he had recently discovered, \"Asthenocormus\". The unusual proportions of that specimen gave a wide range of possible sizes. Some were as low as 13.5 metres (44.3 feet), but extrapolating from the gill basket resulted in an estimated length of 27.6 metres (90.6 feet) for \"Leedsichthys\" specimen NHM P.10156 (the earlier BMNH P.10156). Martill considered the higher estimate as a plausible size of the largest individuals. Subsequently, a length of thirty metres (hundred feet) was often mentioned in popular science publications, sometimes one as high as thirty-five metres (115 feet).\n\nListon in his studies concluded to much lower estimates. Documentation of historical finds and the excavation of \"Ariston\", the most complete specimen ever from the Star Pit near Whittlesey, Peterborough, support Woodward's figures of between 9 and 10 metres (29.5 and 33 feet). With \"Ariston\" the pectoral fins are 1005 millimetres (39.6 inches) apart, indicating a narrow body of no excessive size, even though it was initially thought to have been 22 metres (72 feet) long. In 2007 Liston stated that most specimens indicated lengths between 7 and 12 metres (23 and 39 feet). A linear extrapolation from the gill basket would be flawed because the gills grow disproportionally in size, having to increase their surface allometrically to ensure the oxygen supply of a body increasing in volume to the third power. The growth ring structures within the remains of \"Leedsichthys\" have indicated that it would have taken 21 to 25 years to reach these lengths, and isolated elements from other specimens showed that a maximum size of just over is not unreasonable. In 2013 a new study by Liston found most specimens to be between 17 and 31 years old. Specimen GLAHM V3363, \"Big Meg\", could have been between . The exception was NHM P.10156. Its gill basket, with a preserved width of 114 centimetres (44.9 inches) and height of 1545 millimetres (60.8 inches), indicated a body length of and an age of 45 years.\n\nWoodward initially assigned \"Leedsichthys\" to the Acipenseroidea, considering it related to the sturgeon, having the large gill rakers and branching finrays in common. In 1905, he changed this to the Pachycormidae. The Pachycormidae have a somewhat uncertain position. Often they are considered very basal Teleostei — if so, \"Leedsichthys\" would be the largest known teleost — others see them as members of a Pachycormiformes forming the sister group of the Teleostei, and sometimes they are seen as even more basal Amiiformes. In the latter case the extant bowfin, \"Amia calva\", would be the closest living relative of \"Leedsichthys\".\n\nWithin the Pachycormidae, a cladistic analysis found \"Leedsichthys\" to be the sister species of \"Asthenocormus\", their clade being the sister group of \"Martillichthys\".\n\nThis cladogram after Friedman \"et al.\" shows a possible position of \"Leedsichtys\" in the evolutionary tree.\n\nLike the largest fish today, the whale sharks and basking sharks, \"Leedsichthys problematicus\" derived its nutrition as a suspension feeder, using an array of specialised gill rakers lining its gill basket to extract zooplankton, small animals, from the water passing through its mouth and across its gills. It is less clear whether also phytoplankton, algae, were part of the diet. \"Leedsichthys\" could have been a ram feeder, making the water pass through its gills by swimming, but could also have actively pumped the water through the gill basket. In 2010, Liston suggested that fossilised furrows discovered in ancient sea floors in Switzerland and attributed to the activity of plesiosaurs, had in fact been made by \"Leedsichthys\" spouting water through its mouth to disturb and eat the benthos, the animals dwelling in the sea floor mud.\n\nMuch is still uncertain about the life cycle of \"Leedsichthys\". Liston's 2013 study suggested a slow, nearly linear, growth. A French study in 1993 of its bone structure concluded however, that the metabolism was rather high. Also problematic is how \"Leedsichthys\" could increase its size quickly during the first year of its life. Teleostei typically lay relatively small eggs and this has been seen as an obstacle for them attaining giant sizes.\n\nIn 1986, Martill reported the presence of a tooth of the marine crocodile \"Metriorhynchus\" in a bone of \"Leedsichthys\". The bone would have healed, a sign that the about 3-metre-long (10-foot-long) \"Metriorhynchus\" was actively hunting the much larger fish. However, in 2007 Liston concluded the bone tissue had not in fact healed and that this was probably a case of scavenging. An apex predator of the Oxford Clay seas large enough to attack \"Leedsichthys\" was the pliosaurid \"Liopleurodon\".\n\nIn 1999 Martill suggested that a climate change at the end of the Callovian led to the extinction of \"Leedsichthys\" in the northern seas, the southern Ocean offering a last refuge during the Oxfordian. However, in 2010 Liston pointed out that \"Leedsichthys\" during the later Kimmeridgian was still present in the north, as testified by Normandian finds. Liston did nevertheless consider in 2007 that the lack of any vertebrate suspension feeders as large as 0.5 metre (1.6 feet) prior to the Callovian stage of the Mesozoicum might indicate that the Callovian had seen a marked change in productivity as regarded zooplankton populations. Indeed, further studies supported this, viewing \"Leedsichthys\" as the beginning of a long line of large (>2 metres (6.5 feet) in length) pachycormid suspension feeders that continued to flourish well into the Late Cretaceous, such as \"Bonnerichthys\" and \"Rhinconichthys\", and emphasising the convergent evolutionary paths taken by pachycormids and baleen whales.\n\nRecent studies have uncovered some estimations regarding metabolic rate and speed for \"Leedsichthys\". Using data from living teleost fish as a comparison, scientists discovered that \"Leedsichthys\" could have cruised along at potential speeds of while still maintaining oxygenation of its body tissues.\n\n\n"}

The converse operation, removing the reef, is called \"shaking it out.\" Reefing improves the performance of sailing vessels in strong winds, and is the primary safety precaution in rough weather. Reefing sails improves vessel stability and minimizes the risk of damage to the sail or other gear. Proper skills in and equipment for reefing are crucial to averting the dangers of capsizing or broaching in heavy weather.\n\nSails may have built-in alternative attachment points that allow their area to be reduced. In a mainsail, pairs of grommets, called reefing tacks, reefing clews, or reefing cringles may be installed in the sail; a cruising boat will typically have two to three pairs. Pulling these points down to the boom forms a new tack and clew, reducing the sail's area. Using the pair of grommets closest to the boom is called a single reef, using the next pair is called a double reef, and so on. A sail may have \"reef points,\" small holes in the sail between the grommets. These are used to secure the excess fabric of the sail after reefing to minimize flogging and improve visibility from the cockpit. \nTo reef the sail of a Bermuda rigged sloop:\n\nRoller reefing rolls or wraps the sail around a wire, foil, or spar to reduce its exposure to the wind. In mainsail furling systems the sail is either wrapped around the boom by a mechanism in the gooseneck or hardware inside the boom winds it around a rotating foil.\n\nFurling systems controlled with lines led to the cockpit allow reefing without crew having to go on deck in heavy weather. Roller reefing also allows more variable sail area than conventional or jiffy reefing. Countering these advantages are the furled sail possibly not having an optimal shape and sail repair or replacement being more difficult.\n\nJiffy reefing, also called slab or single line reefing, is an alternative to conventional or roller reefing where the sail is folded in sections, or slabs, along the boom. One or two reefing lines reeved through the sail's luff and leach reef cringles create a new tack and clew for the sail by pulling those points tight to the boom. These can be led back to the cockpit to allow crew members to reef without going on deck in heavy weather. Intermediate reef cringles are not used.\n\nThe equipment for jiffy reefing is sometimes integrated with Dutchman flaking, a furling technology that flakes (or folds up) the sail on alternate sides of the boom.\n\n"}

Single-span bridges have abutments at each end which provide vertical and lateral support for the bridge, as well as acting as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans unsupported by abutments. Dam abutments are generally the sides of a valley or gorge, but may be artificial in order to support arch dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan.\n\nThe term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch, or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault. The impost or abacus of a column in classical architecture may also serve as an abutment to an arch.\n\nThe word derives from the verb \"\", meaning to \"touch by means of a mutual border\".\n\nAn abutment may be used for the following:\n\nTypes of abutments include:\n\n"}

It's a simple tool used in many Western countries with hundreds of years of history. It was in use in England at least as early as the 11th century.\n\nThe rebate plane is one of a group of planes, including the shoulder plane, bullnose plane and carriage makers plane, in which the blade protrudes by a very small amount - usually less than half a millimetre - from the sides of the plane body on both sides. The blade is very slightly wider than the body of the plane. The reason for the slight protrusion of the blade is so that the plane body does not bind on the side of the cut, which would result in the side wall of the rabbet not being perpendicular to the bottom.\n\nRebate planes are intended for long grain cutting and are generally set up to remove large amounts of material quickly. The mouth is set quite coarsely to allow large chips to be removed.\n\nThere are a few variations of this plane, including the duplex rebate plane, which has two locations for the blade: one in the middle of the body for normal cutting and one at the front to allow cutting into corners. In the latter mode, the duplex rebate plane is similar to a bullnose plane.\n\nThe rebate plane commonly has a depth stop and a fence, which allows the width and depth of the rabbet to be gauged. They also are commonly equipped with a spur, which is designed to score the wood as the rabbet is cut, giving a cleaner corner. This is particularly valuable when working across the grain.\n"}
