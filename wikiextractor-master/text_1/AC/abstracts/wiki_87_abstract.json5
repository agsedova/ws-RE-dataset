[{"id": "2165997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2165997", "title": "S. Yizhar", "text": "Yizhar Smilansky (, 27 September 1916 \u2013 21 August 2006), known by his pen name S. Yizhar (), was an Israeli writer and politician.\n\nYizhar Smilansky was born in Rehovot to a family of writers. His great uncle was Israeli writer Moshe Smilansky. His father, Zev Zass Smilensky, was also a writer. After earning a degree in education, Yizhar taught in Yavniel, Ben Shemen, Hulda, and Rehovot.\n\nYizhar married Noemi Wollman in 1942. They had three children, Yisrael (born 1942), Hila (born 1944), and Ze'ev (born 1954).\n\nFrom the end of the 1930s to the 1950s, Yizhar published short novellas, among them \"Ephraim Goes Back to Alfalfa\", \"On the Edge of the Negev\", \"The Wood on the Hill\", \"A Night Without Shootings\", \"Journey to the Evening's Shores\", \"Midnight Convoy\", as well as several collections of short stories. His pen name was given to him by the poet and editor Yitzhak Lamdan, when in 1938 he published Yizhar's first story \"Ephraim Goes Back to Alfalfa\" in his literary journal \"Galleons\". From then on, Yizhar signed his works with his pen name.\n\nIn 1949, he published the novella \"Khirbet Khizeh\", in which he described the fictional expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from their fictional village by the IDF during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It became a best-seller and in 1964 was included in the Israeli high school curriculum. In 1978, a controversy arose after a dramatization of \"Khirbet Khizeh\" by director Ram Loevy was aired on Israeli television. Shapira has lamented that, despite the publishing of Yizhar's novella decades earlier, Benny Morris was able, when he published \"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947\u20131949\" in 1988, to announce \"himself as the man who had laid bare the original sin of the State of Israel\".\n\nIn the late 1950s, his massive work \"Days of Ziklag\" appeared, comprising two volumes and more than a thousand pages. This work had a powerful impact on changing the outlook for Hebrew prose on the one hand, and \"war literature\" on the other. \nAlthough Yizhar remained in the public eye as an outstanding polemicist, he broke his decades-long literary silence only in 1992 with the publication of his novel, \"Mikdamot\" (Preliminaries). This was quickly followed by five additional new volumes of prose, both novels and collections of short stories, including \"Tsalhavim\", \"Etsel Ha-Yam\" (At Sea), \"Tsedadiyim\" (Asides), and \"Malkomyah Yefehfiyah\" (Beautiful Malcolmia). His last work, \"Gilui Eliahu\" (Discovering Elijah), set in the period of the Yom Kippur War, was published in 1999 and later adapted for the stage. The play won first prize at the Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre in 2001. Yizhar also wrote stories for children in which he contended with the defining themes of his youth, as in \"Oran and Ange\" concerning the Israeli cultivation of citrus fruits; \"Uncle Moshe's Chariot\", a memoir of the character of his famous great uncle Moshe Smilansky; and others.\n\nYizhar was a professor of education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1986-7 he was Visiting Writer at the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard University. He was a lecturer at Levinsky College in Tel Aviv into the late 1990s.\n\nYizhar was elected to the first Knesset in 1949, remaining a Knesset member until the 1955 elections. He returned to the Knesset in October 1956 as a replacement for Aharon Becker. In 1965 he defected to David Ben-Gurion's new Rafi party, but resigned from the Knesset on 20 February 1967. He subsequently joined Ben-Gurion's new National List and was given the symbolic 120th place on its list for the 1969 elections.\n\nYizhar's early work was influenced by Uri Nissan Gnessin. His knowledge of Israeli geology, geomorphology, climate, and flora is evident in his landscape descriptions and his emphasis on the relationship between person and place. Yizhar's use of language is unique. With his long sentences and combination of literary Hebrew and street jargon, he draws the reader into his heroes' stream of consciousness.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166000", "title": "Giant pumpkin", "text": "A giant pumpkin is an orange fruit of the squash \"C. maxima\" commonly weighing from 150 pounds to over one ton.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166009", "title": "Jim's Journal", "text": "Jim's Journal is a comic strip written and drawn by Scott Dikkers, co-founder of \"The Onion\". The strip first appeared in the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison \"The Daily Cardinal\" newspaper in 1988.\n\nSince April 25, 2011, \"Jim's Journal\" has run on \"GoComics\" featuring both new and classic comics.\n\nOn the flyleaf of the first \"Jim's Journal\" collection is a felt-pen drawing of a nondescript young man sitting at a desk and writing in a notebook. Above him are the words, \"I'm Jim. This is the journal of my day-to-day life.\"\n\nAnd that's just what the strip is: nuggets of experience, not processed by Jim, but merely recorded as he moves passively through his world. No context is provided, though anyone who's been to college, worked a minimum-wage job, or lived in a rundown apartment building can supply it. \nJim and his friends muddle through school and a series of dead-end jobs, have vague dreams (never seriously attempted) of working in the entertainment business or the space program, and share thoughts such as \"I don't think life is absurd or meaningless. I think it's funny.\" In Jim's world, it is enough to simply exist, and order a pizza once in a while.\n\nDikkers' purpose was to parody the typical four-panel comic strip, creating a character-driven strip with a main character who had no discernible personality, observational humor that provided no insights, and no comic timing, just strips that ended without a gag, or sometimes without even a conclusion. Dikkers calls this style anti-humor, \"creating humor by poking fun at other humor\". (Dikkers, 1999)\n\nHe is an almost completely passive person, speaking little and almost never initiating conversation, content to go to school or work, come home, and occasionally venture out in the company of his few friends. He is a keen observer, though he seems to lack the capacity to draw conclusions about what he sees.\n\nJim's college roommate, and later off-campus apartmentmate. Tony is impulsive, often trying out new lifestyles and hobbies, but his short attention span and low threshold of disappointment prevent him from making any major changes. He loves practical jokes, but lacks the knowhow for them to succeed, and appoints himself expert on many subjects, though his attention span for other peoples' interests is slight.\n\nTony was the (stereo)typical college student: drinking and partying, trying to cram an entire semester's worth of work into a week, and hopelessly pursuing girls who dismissed him as immature. After college, he was unable to find a job that would let him use his economics degree. After a long tenure at his older brother's shoe store, he moved \"up\" to selling cable TV subscriptions over the phone.\n\nJim met Ruth while working at McDonald's. She is cheerful and kind, if a bit overbearing, and easily the most mature and responsible character in the strip. She was made crew chief at McDonald's, and after graduation, found a job in her chosen field as a dental assistant.\n\nLate in the strip, she and Jim were married, though Jim never documented any change in their relationship before the wedding. Since then, she has devoted herself to the roles of wife, wage-earner and homemaker, and has been gently trying to influence Jim to be more ambitious.\n\nSteve was brought into the strip as a third roommate when Jim and Tony moved into their off-campus apartment. He attended the same high school as Tony, a year behind him. Steve was intimidated by the college experience at first; it has never been made clear whether or not he graduated, nor what job he holds, if any. His fondness for junk food and junk TV led to an iconic strip panel, in which he sat in front of the TV eating cereal right out of the box.\n\nSteve strives to be intellectual and creative, without much success, but his native intelligence puts him ahead of Tony, who once tried to play a practical joke on him that fell utterly flat. At times, he exhibits some whimsy, climbing a tree \"because it would be fun\", or cracking jokes that no one gets except him.\n\nJim's cat. Steve returned from his hometown with a kitten, whom he named Mr. Peterson for no known reason. When he attempted to have the cat neutered, Mr. Peterson was revealed to be a female, but her name was not changed. When the three roommates took separate apartments, she became Jim's cat by default.\n\nJim's college classmate, and co-worker at McDonald's. Mark is a typical 1990s pseudointellectual. When they met, Jim noted that Mark \"always points out the dreary, hopeless aspect of everything.\" Jim thought Mark might be trying to be funny, but also observes that in four years at McDonald's, Mark had never gotten a raise, which might be a source of his bitterness. He and Jim take a creative writing course in college. When Mark is absent one day, Jim observes that \"the class was quiet without him.\" Despite sounding off constantly, Mark objects to criticism of his own work, claiming that artistic expression should not be graded.\n\nAnother McDonald's co-worker. Cheerful and gifted with a genuine flair for comedy, he leaves McDonald's to do stand-up. When he breaks his leg, he welcomes the chance to incorporate it into his act, so he can \"stop doing the fat-guy schtick.\"\n\nJim's co-worker at the copy store. Dan is a quirky geek, more concerned with larger concepts such as time travel, which he thinks would be \"neat\", than with his own shortcomings. He brings burnt cookies to work, claiming that he likes them that way because it adds flavor. He welcomes guests to his squalid apartment and clears mounds of junk off the couch so they can sit to watch his videos. Later, he stands up to Joel, another co-worker, and the dispute ends with Joel's firing, prompting Dan to observe that \"there is justice in the galaxy.\"\n\nCopy store co-worker. The source of his feud with Dan is never disclosed, although Joel's generally abrasive personality might have something to do with it.\n\nCopy store co-worker. Apparently depressed to be working so far below her potential, Julie takes out her frustrations on Jim, once throwing a roll of tape at his head. Another time, she asked what she could do on her break. When Jim had no suggestion, she mused, \"Maybe I'll drop dead.\"\n\nCopy store co-worker. Brian is a true slacker, doing as little as possible, showing no enthusiasm, and even smoking on the job. When Jim asks why he doesn't like working there, he replies, \"It's not MY copy store -- I can only care so much.\" Later, he quits without notice, reportedly one step ahead of being fired.\n\nJim's first boss at McDonald's, characterized by his \"odd reverence\" for the company. Early on, he expressed great pride in Jim for mastering the task of heating fish fillet buns, but when Jim dropped a tray of hamburgers, he didn't speak to Jim the rest of the day. After Jim left McDonald's at the end of his freshman year, he snubbed Jim when they met outside the store.\n\nSteve's replacement. Friendlier and more accessible than Steve. Jim returned to McDonald's when she attempted to round up the disgruntled employees from Steve's tenure.\n\nManager at the copy store. He makes occasional attempts to motivate his employees, such as letting them choose the radio station or bringing malted milks for the staff when they're overloaded with work. However, he once reminded the staff that being manager is \"like working 24 hours a day.\" When Dan was describing the similarities between ape and human social structure, Hal's entrance was perfectly timed to establish him as the alpha.\n\nJim works a series of minimum wage jobs. He initially applied at McDonald's as a way of meeting people and filling downtime, and quit at the end of the school year. Early in his sophomore year, he was called back to McDonald's, then, after leaving college, applied at a bookstore, where he worked for a short time before being laid off. His longest-lasting job was at a copy store, where he once envisioned a bleak future as the manager. He then had another dead-end job at a grocery. We were never told what Jim's major was in college, and he has never expressed a desire to pursue any particular line of work. The impression is that Jim works because that's what people are supposed to do.\n\nJim has no hobbies to speak of, only occasionally joining Tony or Steve in a game of basketball or billiards, or reading Trivial Pursuit answers for hours at a time. Entertainment for him is either reading a book (at someone else's recommendation), watching a movie, watching Mr. Peterson, or sitting in front of the TV, flipping channels. After Jim and Ruth are married, Ruth attempts to get him into bird watching and stamp collecting, and is upset when he has no interest in either.\n\nOn occasion, however, Jim does take time to explore his city and surroundings, as demonstrated by his aimless wanderings around malls or his riding on a bus all day \"not going anywhere in particular.\"\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166014", "title": "Alexander Monro (primus)", "text": "Alexander Monro primus (19 September 169710 July 1767) was a Scottish surgeon and anatomist. His father, the surgeon John Monro, had been a prime mover in the foundation of the Edinburgh Medical School and had arranged Alexander's education in the hope that his son might become the first Professor of Anatomy in the new university medical school. After medical studies in Edinburgh, London, Paris and Leiden, Alexander Monro returned to Edinburgh, and pursued a career as a surgeon and anatomy teacher. With the support of his father and the patronage of the Edinburgh Lord Provost George Drummond, Alexander Monro was appointed foundation Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. His lectures, delivered in English, rather than the conventional Latin, proved popular with students and his qualities as a teacher contributed to the success and reputation of the Edinburgh medical school. He is known as Alexander Monro \"primus\" to distinguish him from his son Alexander Monro \"secundus\" and his grandson Alexander Monro \"tertius,\" who both followed him in the chair of anatomy. These three Monros between them held the Edinburgh University Chair of Anatomy for 126 years.\n\nAlexander Monro was the son of John Monro and his wife Jean Forbes, who was his first cousin. John Monro was a Monro of Auchenbowie, a cadet branch of Clan Munro, descended from the Monros of Foulis. John Monro was a military surgeon and his son Alexander was born in London while he was on military duty there. When Alexander was three the family returned to Edinburgh, where John Monro took great care with his son's education. He had him instructed in Latin, Greek and French, and in philosophy, arithmetic and book-keeping. Alexander attended classes at the University of Edinburgh between 1710 and 1713 but did not graduate. He was then bound apprentice to his father, who was by now in practice as a surgeon in Edinburgh. During this apprenticeship he also attended courses in botany delivered by George Preston, courses in chemistry by Dr James Crawford and anatomy dissections at Surgeons Hall by Messers Robert Eliot, Adam Drummond and John McGill.\n\nIn 1717 on completion of his apprenticeship, Alexander Munro was sent to London to study anatomy under William Cheselden, the famous surgeon who was a renowned teacher and a skilful demonstrator. A lasting friendship was formed between the two men.\n\nTo gain as much experience as possible Monro lodged in the house of an apothecary and visited patients with him. He also attended lectures by the theologian and mathematician William Whiston and the physicist Francis Hauksbee on experimental philosophy. He made dissections of the human body and of various animals and demonstrated a natural aptitude for this work. His career was nearly cut short as a result of a scratch on the hand inflicted while he was dissecting the suppurated lung of a subject, known to have phthisis (tuberculosis). His mentor and friend, the Scots born accoucheur and anatomist James Douglas was concerned that he would lose the arm as a result of the soft tissue infection which developed.\n\nMonro took an active part in discussions, and in one of his papers first sketched his \"Account of the Bones in General\". This would form the basis of his later textbook on osteology. Before he left London he sent home to his father some of his anatomical specimens. His father showed these to members of the Royal College of Physicians and the Incorporation of Surgeons. They were so impressed with the quality of these dissections that Adam Drummond, on seeing them, indicated that would resign his share of the professorship of anatomy in favour of Monro.\n\nIn the spring of 1718, Alexander Monro p\"rimus\" went to Paris where attended lectures on botany in the Jardin du Roy. He walked the wards of the hospitals including Hotel Dieu where he attended a course of anatomy given by Bourquet. He performed operations under the direction of Thibaut and had instruction in midwifery from Gregoire, in bandaging from Cesau, and in botany from Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chomel.\n\nOn 16 November 1718, Monro entered as a student of Leiden University to study under Herman Boerhaave, the great physician and teacher, who lectured on the theory and practice of physic. On Boerhaave's recommendation he visited Frederik Ruysch, professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam, where he saw Ruysch's large collection of anatomical dissections and learned from him techniques of preservation of anatomical specimens. Patients from Scotland who came to consult Boerhaave in Leiden were often put under Monro's care. Like many Scottish students at Leiden he did not sit the examinations for the degree of MD.\n\nOn his return to Edinburgh in the autumn of 1719, Monro sat the four part examination to become a Freeman (Fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons and was admitted as a Fellow on 19 November. Adam Drummond then fulfilled his promise of resigning his professorship, and John M'Gill did likewise. \nThey also gave a recommendation in favour of Monro to the Town Council, the patrons of the University. \nThis was backed by the Incorporation of Surgeons, and on 22 January 1720 the Council appointed Monro Professor of Anatomy with a salary of \u00a315 sterling, this modest sum being supplemented by the students' fees of three guineas a head.\n\nMonro's original appointment as professor was only at the pleasure of the Town Council, who at that time administered the University or Town's College. In 1722, encouraged by his success, Monro applied to the Council for permanent status, and although the Council had as lately as August 1719 reaffirmed the principle that regentships and professorships were to be held at their pleasure, they now departed from this and on 14 March 1722, nominated Alexander Monro sole Professor of Anatomy in the City and College.\n\nUntil 1725, Monro continued to lecture in the old Surgeons' Hall on the south side of Surgeons' Square. The popularity of his teaching had led to an increased demand for cadavers for dissection. Despite the fact that Monro had publicly declared his \"...Abhorrence for the vile, abominable and most inhumane Crime of stealing human bodies out of their graves...\" public anger was directed against anatomists. This led to public demonstrations and riots which Monro felt endangered him and his collection of dissected specimens. Monro appealed to the Town Council to allow him to lecture and perform anatomical demonstrations within the relative safety of the University. The Council agreed and Monro moved from Surgeons Hall to the University of Edinburgh, being formally inaugurated to the university chair on 3 November 1725.\n\nThe initial medical faculty was completed in February 1726 with the appointment of John Rutherford and John Innes as Professors of the Practice of Physic, Andrew St Clair as Professor of the Institutes of Theory of Medicine, Andrew Plummer as professor of Chemistry, and John Gibson as professor of Midwifery.\n\nJohn Monro's vision of the new Edinburgh medical school was based on the Leiden model of a medical faculty within a university and with an associated teaching hospital. In 1721 Alexander Monro circulated a pamphlet setting out the case for this hospital. Lord Provost George Drummond helped secure financial backing from local surgeons, physicians, wealthy citizens and Church of Scotland parishes. Monro and the committee of donors established this hospital in August 1729 in a house in Robertson's Close, rented from the university. This had six beds where the sick poor could be treated and provide clinical teaching for medical students. This 'Hospital for the Sick Poor' or 'Little House' as it was known was the origin of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1736 it received a Royal Charter from King George II, which conferred the 'Royal' designation. With the growth of the new medical school this soon became too small for purpose and a new teaching hospital was commissioned, designed by the leading architect William Adam. The original hospital moved in 1741 and the new hospital was finally completed in 1745. Among the first admissions to the completed hospital were casualties from the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745. Monro \"primus\", a staunch Hanoverian, treated the wounded of both sides at the battlefield and afterwards in the new Royal Infirmary.\n\nAt the end of 1726, Monro published his only major textbook \"The Anatomy of the Human Bones,\" which went through eight editions in his lifetime and a further three after his death. Later editions included a description of \"The Anatomy of the Human Nerves\". It was translated into most European languages and in 1759 a French folio edition was published in Paris with elegant engravings by Joseph Sue, Professor of Anatomy to the Royal Schools of Surgery and to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris.\nThomas Thomson wrote that the book \"may be considered as the completion on the subject, since it would be exceedingly difficult and perfectly unnecessary to introduce any improvements upon the descriptions which Dr Monro has given.\"\n\nThe great reputation attained by Monro's work did much to increase the fame of the new school of medicine on Edinburgh. In 1764, he resigned his professorship, but continued to give clinical lectures at the hospital. In the same year, he published \"An Account of the Inoculation of Small-pox in Scotland.\"\n\nAs a Freeman (or Fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons, Monro continued his surgical practice alongside anatomy teaching. Like all three generations, Monro \"primus\" was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Monro s\"ecundus\" and Monro t\"ertius\" were also Presidents of the RCPE.\n\nMonro was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, on 27 June 1723, on the recommendation of William Cheseldon.\n\nIn 1731 Monro was the driving force in the foundation of the Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, and he became its first secretary. The following year the Society began to publish \"Medical Essays and Observations\" with Monro as editor. A total of six volumes were published consisting of case reports from around the British Isles, reviews of the literature and book reviews, with most of the reviews being written by Monro himself. These were popular and important in their day, being translated into French, German and Dutch. \"Medical Essays and Observations\" regarded as the first regular medical journal in Britain and one of the first in the world It was also the first medical journal to introduce anonymised peer review. This innovative publication helped to establish Monro as a major figure of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nAfter a period of inactivity the society was reformed as the Philosophical Society, which also lapsed but was revived in 1752 with Monro and the philosopher David Hume as joint secretaries. In 1783 the Philosophical Society received a Royal Charter to become the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Monro was also a member of the Select Society , which had been founded in 1754 by the painter Allan Ramsay \"...to discover the most effectual methods of promoting the good of the country.\"\n\nIn 1765 Monro published an account of the extent of inoculation against smallpox in Scotland, in which he estimated that only 88 of Scotland's doctors, out of an estimated 270, had taken up the procedure and had inoculated a total of 5,554 people.\n\nIn 1725, he married Isabella MacDonald (1694 -1774), third daughter of Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat. They had three sons and a daughter. The eldest son John Monro (1725-1789) became an advocate and then procurator Fiscal to the High Court of Admiralty. He inherited Achenbowie to become 5th of Auchenbowie. The second son Donald Monro (1727\u20131802) graduated MD and became Physician-General to the army, physician to St George's Hospital, London and a Fellow of the Royal Society. The third son Alexander Monro \"secundus\" (1733\u20131817) succeeded his father as Professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. For Margaret (d1802) his only surviving daughter Monro \"primus\" wrote \"An essay on female conduct \"'intended to improve her education\".\"\n\nFrom 1730 Monro lived in a large flat on the south side of the Lawnmarket, moving in 1750 to Covenant Close off the High Street.\n\nHe died at his home in Covenant Close, Edinburgh of rectal cancer on 10 July 1767. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in the centre of Edinburgh with his wife and son, Alexander \"secundus\".\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166015", "title": "Omar ibn Said", "text": "Omar ibn Said ( \"'Umar bin Sa'iid\"; 1770\u20131864) was a writer and Islamic scholar, born and educated in what is now Senegal in West Africa, who was enslaved and transported to the United States in 1807. There, while enslaved for the remainder of his life, he wrote a series of works of history and theology, including a posthumously famous autobiography.\n\nOmar ibn Said was born in present-day Senegal in Futa Toro, a region along the Middle Senegal River in West Africa, to a wealthy family. He was an Islamic scholar and a Fula who spent 25 years of his life studying with prominent Muslim scholars, learning subjects ranging from arithmetic to theology in Africa. In 1807, he was captured during a military conflict, enslaved and taken across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. He escaped from a cruel master in Charleston, South Carolina, and journeyed to Fayetteville, North Carolina. There he was recaptured and later sold to James Owen. Said lived into his mid-nineties and was still enslaved at the time of his death in 1864. He was buried in Bladen County, North Carolina. Omar ibn Sa'id was also known as Uncle Moreau and Prince Omeroh.\n\nAlthough Omar converted to Christianity on December 3, 1820, there are dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible, and a card dated 1857 on which he wrote \"Surat An-Nasr\", a short \"sura\" which refers to the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam 'in multitudes.' The back of this card contains another person's handwriting in English misidentifying the \"sura\" as the Lord's Prayer and attesting to Omar's status as a good Christian. Additionally, while others writing on Omar's behalf identified him as a Christian, his own autobiography and other writings offer more of an ambiguous position. In the autobiography, he still offers praise to Muhammad when describing his life in his own country; his references to \"Jesus the Messiah\" in fact parallel Quranic descriptions of Jesus (who is called \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u064a\u062d 'the Messiah' a total of eleven times in the \"Quran\"), and descriptions of Jesus as 'our lord/master' (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627) employ the typical Islamic honorific for prophets and is not to be confused with Lord (\u0631\u0628\u0651); and description of Jesus as 'bringing grace and truth' (a reference to John 1:14) is equally appropriate to the conception of Jesus in Islam.\n\nLiterary analysis of Said\u2019s autobiography suggests that he wrote it for two audiences, the white literates who sought to exploit his conversion to Christianity and Muslim readers who would recognize Qur'anic literary devices and subtext and understand his position as a fellow Muslim living under persecution. In a letter written to Sheikh Hunter regarding the autobiography, he apologized for forgetting the \"talk\" of his homeland and ended the letter saying: \"O my brothers, do not blame me,\" with the knowledge that Hunter would require Arabic-speaking translators to read the message. Scholar Basima Kamel Shaheen argues that Said\u2019s spiritual ambiguity may have been purposefully cultivated to impress upon a wide readership the injustices of slavery.\n\nOmar ibn Said is widely known for fourteen manuscripts that he wrote in Arabic. Out of all of his Arabic manuscripts, he is best known for his autobiographical essay, \"The Life of Omar Ibn Said\", written in 1831. It describes some of the events of his life and includes reflections on his steadfast adherence to Islam and his openness towards other \"God-fearing\" people. On the surface, the document may appear to be tolerant towards slavery; however, Said begins it with \"Surat Al-Mulk\", a chapter from the \"Qur'an\", which states that only God has sovereignty over human beings. The manuscript is the only known Arabic autobiography by a slave in America. It was sold within a collection of Sa'id's documents between private collectors prior to its acquisition by the Library of Congress in 2017. It has since been treated for preservation and made viewable online. \n\nMost of Said\u2019s other work consisted of Islamic manuscripts in Arabic, including a handwritten copy of some short chapters (\"surat\") from the \"Qur'an\" that are now part of the North Carolina Collection in the Wilson Library at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Transcribing from memory, ibn Said made some mistakes in his work, notably at the start of \"Surat An-Nasr\". His Bible, a translation into Arabic published by a missionary society, which has notations in Arabic by Omar, is part of the rare books collection at Davidson College. Sa'id was also the author of a letter, dated 1819, addressed to James Owen's brother, Major John Owen, written in Arabic and containing numerous Quranic references (including from the above-mentioned \"Surat Al-Mulk\"), which also includes several geometric symbols and shapes which point to its possible esoteric intentions. This letter, currently housed in Andover Theological Seminary, is reprinted in Allen Austin's \"African Muslims in Antebellum America: A Sourcebook.\"\n\nIn 1991, a mosque in Fayetteville, North Carolina renamed itself Masjid Omar ibn Sayyid in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166019", "title": "Magelang", "text": "Magelang () is one of six cities in Central Java, each of which is governed by a mayor rather than a bupati. It is located in the middle of the Magelang Regency, between Mount Merbabu and Mount Sumbing in Central Java Province, Indonesia. Magelang is located 43\u00a0km north of Yogyakarta, 15\u00a0km north of Mungkid and 75\u00a0km south of Semarang, the capital of Central Java.\nMagelang was established on 11 April 907. Magelang was then known as a village called \"Mantyasih\", which is now known as \"Meteseh\".\n\nThere are three stele of historical importance in Magelang, namely Poh, Gilikan and Mantyasih, all of which are written on a plate of copper. \"Poh\" and \"Mantyasih\" were written under the rule of King Balitung of Mataram Kingdom. In those stele, the villages of Mantyasih and Glanggang were mentioned. They became Meteseh and Magelang respectively.\n\nIn Mantyasih stele, it mentioned the name of King Watukura Dyah Balitung, as well as \"829 \u00c7aka bulan \u00c7aitra tanggal 11 Paro-Gelap Paringkelan Tungle, Pasaran Umanis hari Senais S\u00e7ara atau Sabtu\", which means Saturday Legi, 11 April 907. The village Mantyasih was made by the king as tax-free village which was led by a \"patih\" (similar to Prime Minister nowadays). Also mentioned are Mount Susundara and Mount Wukir Sumbing which is now known as Mount Sindoro and Mount Sumbing.\n\nWhen Britain colonised Magelang in the eighteenth century, Magelang became the seat of the government and was made to the same level as a regency with Mas Ngabehi Danukromo as its first leader (Bupati). Mas Ngabehi Danukromo built Alun-Alun (town square), bupati residence and a mosque. Magelang became the capital of \"Karesidenan Kedu\" in 1818.\nAfter the Dutch defeated the British, Magelang was made as the central of economy because its strategic location. The Dutch government built drinking water tower (known locally as \"Menara Air Minum\") in 1918 which provides the city with water. Electricity became available in 1927. The roads were remade using asphalt.\n\nThe city has historically been a military post, dating back to the Dutch East Indies colonial era. It subsequently acted as an army stronghold for Indonesian pro-independence movements against the Dutch government during the resistance period. Currently, it is a host of two military landmarks: The National Military Academy, and the only military-associated school, Taruna Nusantara.\n\nJournalist Taichiro Kaijimura announced on 12 May 2007 the discovery of 30 Netherlands government documents submitted to the Tokyo tribunal as an evidence of a forced massed prostitution incident by the Japanese army in 1944 in Magelang.\n\nAfter the independence of Indonesia, Magelang became \"kotapraja\" (same level as a district) and then \"kotamadya\" (same level as city).\n\nMagelang City is a city which is located in a fertile agricultural area and one of the most densely populated regions on Central Java. Magelang City has two borders. The western border is Progo River and the Eastern Boones Elo River. The city is divided into three districts and several sub-districts.\n\nMagelang Utara (North Magelang):\n\nMagelang Tengah (Central Magelang):\n\nMagelang Selatan (South Magelang):\n\nThe composition of demography based on its religion and belief, Magelang people has varied and different belief and religion. Majority of Magelang citizen are Muslim, but there are minority groups such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, and there are also spiritualism and traditional Javanese belief.\n\nAs of February 2010, Magelang has a total population of 118,227. Magelang's population was 58,311 men (49% of the total population) and 59,916 women (51% of the total population).\n\nMagelang is the closest major town to Borobudur, a ninth-century Buddhist monument located about north-west of Yogyakarta. The Canggal Temple, also located in the Magelang regency, has a Sanskrit transcription bearing the name of the first Mataram Kingdom ruler, Sanjaya.\n\nThere is white water rafting on the Elo River, located in the district of Magelang. Elo river disgorges from Mount Merbabu, Mount Telomoyo and Mount Ungaran, so it is not affected by the flow of volcanic material from Mount Merapi. The river is ideal for white water rafting because the characters of flow and flooding are relatively stable, so it is relatively safe to be forded in both the dry and rainy seasons. Running rafting chosen difficulty level (grade) maximum III + and suitable for families. The track has a length of about 12.5\u00a0km and reached in 2.5 \u2013 3 hours rafting.\n\nA number of the town's buildings from the Dutch East Indies era have become heritage landmarks. The Karesidenan Kedu building, is now known as \"Museum Pangeran Diponegoro\", where Prince Diponegoro was arrested by the Dutch colonial government during the Java War (1825\u20131830). The chair on which the Prince sat remains in the museum. A fingernail, believed to be Diponegoro's, remains on the arm of the chair. A statue in his honour stands in Magelang's town square.\n\nJalan Pemuda (\"Youth Street\") is Magelang's Pecinan (Chinatown). The one-way road is the centre of business and includes shops, a minimarket, and restaurants. The road, running along a former railroad, is divided with a narrow section reserved for rickshawss.\n\nThe Alun-alun or town square is located in the city centre. The area has the Matahari and Gardena department stores, Magelang's only cinema, to the north the Trio Plaza and the BCA tower; in the south a police station, the BPD Bank building, and a Confucian temple along Jalan Pemuda. In the west, is city's largest mosque, locally known as \"Kauman\". Within the vicinity of the town square is a watertower, and also a statue of Diponegoro riding a horse.\n\nThere are a number of sport venues in Magelang. In 2006, for example, a golf course was opened: the Borobudur International Golf and Country Club. The Abu Bakrin football stadium is located on Jl. Tidar, which is near the golf course. Besides, the Gedung Olah Raga \"Samapta\" is a popular sport venue in the sub-district of North Magelang. The area is being developed because of the plan to raise its status to Sport Centre of the Central Java. It is located in the east of the Progo river.\n\nA 28-hectare park, \"Kyai Langgeng\", is located at Cempaka Street approximately one kilometer south of the city centre. Research is undertaken on rare plant species here. The park has a playground for children and their families. The river Progo is accessible from this park.\n\n\"Badaan\" park is located in Jalan Pahlawan (Pahlawan Road) and one of two parks in Magelang. The park is smaller than \"Kyai Langgeng\" and mostly regarded as a children's playground. There are animal statues within the park such as rhino the animal used as its namesake, elephant and giraffe. Hawkers sell a variety of \"bakso\" (Meat Balls) in the vicinity of the park.\n\nMount Tidar is located in Magersari, South Magelang and located within the complex of Military Academy (Akmil). Here lies the remains of Syekh Subakir from Iran.\n\nAlthough Magelang City is a small city, it has a number of universities or academy or colleges. At least, there are six universities located in Magelang City such as Military Academy of Magelang (AKMIL), Muhammadiyah University of Magelang (UMM), Tidar University of Magelang (UTM), Bina Patria Computer College of Magelang (STIMIK Bina Patria), Tirtawiayasa Water College (Akademi Tirtawiyasa), and Nurse Academy of Magelang (AKPER Magelang)\n\nMain transportation which is operating in Magelang are cars, motorcycles, buses, paddy cabs, becak, and bicycles. Today, the most popular of them are cars and motorcycles. Even almost all of the household have a motorcycle as mean of mobility in daily activity. Then, for public transportation is mainly using buses and cars.\n\nMagelang used to have a railway track from Semarang to Yogyakarta passing at its centre (along Jalan Pemuda), but have since been redirected outside the city. Unfortunately, today the railway track does not function again. It was closed by the government due to the operational cost in that time.\n\nMagelang does not have its own airport and therefore relies on Yogyakarta's Adisutjipto International Airport, Surakarta's Adisumarmo International Airport and Semarang's Achmad Yani International Airport. Then, to reach the airport, especially Adisucipto, from Magelang needs about one hour by bus or car or taxi. But today the easier way to reach Adi Sucipto International Airport in Yogyakarta is by using DAMRI buses that specially operated to carry people from Magelang to Adi Sucipto Airport and its way-back.\n\nNovember 2011: Due to lava flooding from Mount Merapi through Kali Putih River in Gempol, Magelang, the main road connecting Magelang and Yogyakarta has several times closed. An estimated Rp.64 billion ($7.3 million) project to build bridge over the river, a 2.3 kilometer-long stream dredge and land acquisition is being built by government.\n\nMagelang's motto is HARAPAN (in English: Hope). It is made of \"Hidup\", \"Aman\", \"RAPi\", \"Asri\" dan \"Nyaman\" (in English: living, safe, tidy, green, and comfort)\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166021", "title": "Puruvesi", "text": "Puruvesi is a lake in Eastern Finland.

As is the case of other lakes of Saimaa, it has numerous islands and consists of numerous open lake areas, of which largest are Hummonselk\u00e4, Pajuselk\u00e4, Sammalselk\u00e4, Mustanselk\u00e4, and Ruosteselk\u00e4.\n\nThe lake is known for its pure water and has uniquely good underwater visibility for a Finnish lake, easily extending to from the surface on calm and sunny days.\n\nRecently, the Saimaa Ringed Seal, a rare freshwater seal species, has returned to Puruvesi. Sightings of this animal have occurred frequently in 2006, 2007 and 2008. At least one seal was also sighted in the winter of 2009 as having wintered and given birth in the eastern part of Puruvesi.\n"}, {"id": "2166024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166024", "title": "Ipoh white coffee", "text": "Ipoh white coffee is a popular coffee drink which originated in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, resulting in Ipoh being named one of the top three coffee towns by Lonely Planet. The coffee beans are roasted with palm oil margarine, and the resulting coffee is served with condensed milk.\n\nThe term \u2018white coffee\u2019 originates from the literal translation of its Chinese name, which was introduced in the 19th century by Chinese migrants who came to work in the local tin mines. The coffee beans themselves are not actually white; the colour comes from the milk stirred into the end product.\n\nIn Malaysia, the original white coffee started in the Ipoh and was a drink made from beans roasted in margarine, ground, brewed, and served with sweetened condensed milk. This style of coffee continues to be popular throughout the country. However, \u201cWhite Coffee\u201d in Malaysia often simply refers to how the drink is prepared and presented - with added milk or creamer.\n\nOverseas visitors finding the margarine-roasted coffee beans unorthodox (due to their slight caramelized flavor) are often misled into believing that there is a type of coffee bean endemic to Malaysia called the \"white coffee bean\". The beans used are invariably imported beans roasted to a light color.\n\nLocal coffee manufacturers now mix instant coffee powder with non-dairy creamer or whitener and sugar, and market the 3-in-1 mixture as white coffee as well. The mixture is preferred by Malaysians at home or in the office as a convenient easy-to-prepare coffee drink. The advisability, however, of consuming instant coffee mixed with non-dairy creamer and sugar daily is slowly coming into question, with some manufacturers now taking the sugar out of the mixture, and marketing the 2-in-1 mixture as sugar-free white coffee.\n\nTraditionally, Malaysian style \u2018black\u2019 coffee roast (Kopi-O) is produced by roasting the beans with sugar, margarine and wheat.\n\n\u2018White\u2019 coffee, on the other hand, is produced with only margarine and without any sugar, resulting in a less dark roast. Ipoh White Coffee is also widely available in an instant version. It is sometimes consumed after dinner.\n\nThe generic term \u2018Ipoh white coffee\u2019 in Chinese is \"\u767d\u5496\u5561\"(Jyutping: Ji4bou2 Baak6 Kaa1fei1). Baak6 \"\u767d\" (pinyin: b\u00e1i), commonly meaning white, has nothing to do with the colour in this instance, but is rather a reference to the way the coffee is roasted. In Chinese, B\u00e1i also means \u2018without\u2019 or \u2018unadulterated\u2019, nothing has been added to the coffee during the roasting process.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166035", "title": "Pancreatic duct", "text": "The pancreatic duct, or duct of Wirsung (also, the major pancreatic duct due to the existence of an accessory pancreatic duct), is a duct joining the pancreas to the common bile duct to supply pancreatic juice provided from the exocrine pancreas, which aids in digestion. The pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct just prior to the ampulla of Vater, after which both ducts perforate the medial side of the second portion of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla. There are many anatomical variants reported, but these are quite rare.\n\nThe \"duct of Wirsung\" is named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Johann Georg Wirsung (1589\u20131643).\n\nMost people have just one pancreatic duct. However, some have an additional accessory pancreatic duct, called the Duct of Santorini. An accessory pancreatic duct can be functional or non-functional and may open separately into the second part of the duodenum which is dorsal and usually (in 70%) drains into the duodenum via the minor duodenal papilla. In the other 30% it drains into the main pancreatic duct, which drains into the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla. The main pancreatic duct and the accessory duct both eventually\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014connect to the second part ('D2', the vertical segment) of the duodenum.\n\nIt is named for Giovanni Domenico Santorini.\n\nCompression, obstruction or inflammation of the pancreatic duct may lead to acute pancreatitis. The most common cause for obstruction is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct, a condition called choledocholithiasis. Obstruction can also be due to duodenal inflammation in Crohn's disease. A gallstone may get lodged in the constricted distal end of the ampulla of Vater, where it blocks the flow of both bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. Bile backing up into the pancreatic duct may initiate pancreatitis. The pancreatic duct is generally regarded as abnormally enlarged if being over 3\u00a0mm in the head and 2\u00a0mm in the body or tail.\n\nPancreatic ductal carcinoma is a common form of pancreatic cancer.\n"}, {"id": "2166048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166048", "title": "Playaround", "text": "Playaround was formed from the ashes of Mystique, the first Atari 2600 adult video game company.

Playaround released additional titles unique from those picked up from Mystique, and made female versions of several of their games to try to tap into another market, which didn't work very well. While the games' themes may be considered adult, the graphics are quite blocky and generally poor enough that it takes quite an imagination to see them as anything more than a novelty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother double-ended game was released in Europe called General Retreat/Westward Ho!, but due to the multiple complaints, negative impact and protests that \"Custer's Revenge\" got, it was never released in the U.S. and stayed on European markets.\n"}, {"id": "2166068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166068", "title": "Manning River", "text": "Manning River (Biripi: Boolumbahtee), an open and trained mature wave dominated barrier estuary, is located in the Northern Tablelands and Mid North Coast districts of New South Wales, Australia.\n\nManning River rises below Mount Barrington, on the northeastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range within Barrington Tops National Park, east southeast of Ellerston, and flows generally southeast, joined by eleven tributaries including the Pigna Barney, Barnard, Nowendoc, Gloucester, Dawson, and Lansdowne rivers, descending over its course from the high upper reaches, through the Manning Valley, and out to sea.\n\nThe river flows past the towns of Wingham and Taree. At Taree, the river splits and becomes a double delta. The southern arm reaches its mouth at the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, near Old Bar. The northern arm is joined by the Dawson River and further downstream the Lansdowne River, reaching its mouth at the Tasman Sea, near Harrington Point; creating two separate entrances to the river: Harrington Inlet (north) and Farquhar Inlet (south). Within the delta there are several channels dividing coastal land into large islands, such as Mitchells and Oxley islands. Between Croki (in the north) and east of Bohnock (in the south), Scotts Creek links both the northern and southern passages of the river.\n\nThe Manning River is one of Australia's few large river systems that have not been dammed for water supply purposes anywhere along its catchment. The local water supply is fed by Bootawa Dam, which is an offsite dam, however, water is pumped from the river to the dam whenever river turbidity and flow levels can allow. A small weir is located in the upper reaches of the Barnard River, part of the inter-basin water transfer of the Barnard River Scheme, enabling water to be pumped into the Hunter River to meet the cooling needs of Bayswater and Liddell electric power stations. The scheme is shut down until needed but as of 2006 this scheme was partly decommissioned due to its rare use.\n\nThe Manning River is one of only a few Australian mainland rivers to receive annual winter melting snow deposits.\n\nThe Manning River is variously traversed by the Pacific Highway between Taree and Coopernook, and the North Coast railway line at Taree.\n\nThe traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Manning River and its associated valley are the Australian Aboriginal Biripi people of the Bundjalung nation, who named the river as \"Boolumbahtee\", meaning a place where the brolgas played.\n\nIn 1818, John Oxley crossed and named Harrington and Farquhar inlets during a trip from the Hastings River, near Port Macquarie, to Port Stephens. The Manning River itself was first surveyed by Henry Dangar in 1825 and again in 1826 on behalf of the Australian Agricultural Company. Later in 1826, the river was named Mannings River by Robert Dawson for the Deputy Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company, William Manning. In the same year it was declared that the Manning was the northern limit of the Nineteen Counties, defining the areas of New South Wales where settlers were free to occupy.\n\nUntil 1913, ships servicing the coast brought goods and supplies up the river. Wingham was established at the furthest point supply boats could reach up the river and became the region\u2019s major port. The old cargo wharf at Wingham Brush has since been refurbished. The town of Tinonee was also settled on the river near Taree.\n\nThe Manning River is a large producer of Australian oysters and is home to many fish, the most common being the Dusky Flathead (\"Platycephalus fuscus\"), a common Australian estuary fish. The Manning River is frequented by dolphins and sharks, with some venturing as far up the river to Wingham.\n\nWhales also frequent the river, mainly at the larger Harrington Inlet, although some do enter the Farquar Inlet and generally do not venture far up river. However, on 16 September 1994 a rare tropical Bryde's whale measuring long, nicknamed \"Free Willy\" by locals, ventured much further up river to Taree. After becoming a tourist attraction, and repeatedly evading attempts by conservationists to free him \"Free Willy\" was finally rescued by Seaworld Staff in conjunction with NSW National Parks And Wildlife and ORCA (Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia). \"Willy\" became stranded on a sandbar, and with the assistance of a specially designed inflatable Cetacean Rescue Device, floated and towed back out to sea and was last seen heading for deeper water to the east.\n\nTaree is home to the annual Manning River Summer Festival, which features rowing, and sailing. The Taree Powerboat Club Spectacular is held in the Manning River during the Easter long weekend.\n\nCommercial fishing and oyster farming are both practiced in the Manning. The peak season for oyster production is September to March; and the annual production during 2013 was dozen. The link between Taree and the oyster industry is shown by the presence in Taree of the \"Big Oyster\", a building constructed in the shape of an open oyster shell.\n\nThe Manning River area is popular for domestic tourism.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166074", "title": "Psycholagny", "text": "sycholagny\n"}, {"id": "2166076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166076", "title": "Project Madurai", "text": "Project Madurai (\u0bae\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bc8 \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0b87\u0bb2\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbf\u0baf \u0bae\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bca\u0b95\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd) is an open and voluntary initiative to publish free versions of ancient Tamil literature on the Internet.

It is isolated from other areas of Detroit by industrial warehouses and Interstate 75 (I-75). As a neighborhood, Delray has no legally defined boundaries, but its area usually extends south to the River Rouge, east to the Detroit River, west to M-85 (Fort Street) and I-75, and north to Dragoon Street at Fort Wayne or sometimes farther north to Clark Street.\n\nIn 1930, Delray had approximately 23,000 residents. As of the 2010 Census, the two tracts that cover the area had a population of 2,783, a 33% decrease in population from the 2000 Census. Residents have left over the years due to the increased industrialization and decay of the neighborhood. Much of Delray consists of riverfront industries, interspersed with residential properties, mostly single-family and duplex houses. Due to this high level of disrepair, in 2007, the \"Detroit Metro Times\" described Delray as \"the closest thing to a ghost town within a city.\"\n\nDelray was selected for the location of the upcoming Gordie Howe International Bridge. The enormous project will radically alter the neighborhood and result in the destruction of numerous structures and roadways, as well as the relocation of some residents.\n\nDelray is located at the southern edge of the city limit of Detroit, although it is not the city's southernmost territory. The neighborhoods of Boynton and Oakwood Heights occupy the southernmost strip of Detroit along Outer Drive and Fort Street extending down to the city of Lincoln Park. With no official boundaries, Delray is considered mostly conterminous with two Census Bureau tracts that cover . Major thoroughfares through Delray, which typically represent the neighborhood's boundaries, include Fort Street, I-75 (Fisher Freeway), and West Jefferson Avenue. Delray is relatively isolated from the rest of the city.\n\nThe southern border of Delray is the River Rouge, with the city of River Rouge on the southern side of the river. The two are connected by the West Jefferson Avenue-Rouge River Bridge. Due to a bend at the mouth of the River Rouge, Delray is also bordered on the southeast by the river as well. Across the river at that point lies Zug Island, part of the city of River Rouge. North of Zug Island, Delray borders the Detroit River on the east. No residents of Delray live along either body of water as the land is devoted to riverfront industries and the historic Fort Wayne.\n\nDelray is about west of Downtown Detroit. In 1935 Delray formed the southern portion of Wards 14, 16, 18, and 20. Since 2013 the neighborhood lies within District 6.\n\nHistoric Fort Wayne, built 1843 to guard Detroit from British attack from Amherstburg's Fort Malden, is located at the northeastern end of the neighborhood. The area known as Delray was first platted as \"Belgrade\" in 1836. It was renamed as \"Del Rey\" on October 14, 1851. Augustus D. Burdeno, after returning from the Mexican\u2013American War, convinced other residents to rename the town. He had encountered a Mexican village named \"Del Rey\" (\"of the kings\") during the Mexican-American War. This was associated with the Battle of Molino del Rey. At a later point the name was anglicized to \"Delray\". Most of the village sat in what was Springwells Township, with the rest sitting across the River Rouge in Ecorse Township. In 1870 it received a post office. It incorporated as a village in 1897.\n\nBy 1870, salt was mined there and, shortly thereafter, industries located in Delray thanks to its favorable location along the Detroit River and near the several rail lines that linked Detroit to Toledo. These industries were established long before there was any concern with pollution or environmental degradation. Around 1889 many Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles settled in Delray. Dense housing arrangements appeared to accommodate the immigrants going to Delray. In 1894 Solvay Process Company opened a chemical plant. The company provided a fire service and paved streets to Delray.\n\nIn 1901 Detroit Iron Works built two iron-making blast furnaces on Zug Island, near Delray. The city of Delray Beach, Florida, in Greater Miami was named after Delray in 1901. In 1906 Detroit annexed Delray. Chemical plants and factories opened in Delray. As years passed, residents who were able moved to larger homes in less industrial neighborhoods. As the value of the housing stock declined, absentee owners did not spend on renovation and tenants did not repair their damage thus leading to continued falling values and a desire of tenants to rent rather than own.\n\nIn 1929 the railroad built and owned the Detroit Union Terminal at the corner of Fort Street and Green Street, which later was renamed the Detroit Produce Terminal. It is an efficient location for wholesale distributors to receive semi-truck loads of produce from throughout the world, via east coast ports and the southwest border with Mexico. As crops are harvested across the US and Canada, they are delivered to the wholesalers who market to buyers who walk the corridors between various produce display rooms. Most restaurant patrons and grocery shoppers in Metro Detroit and other Michigan communities have competitively priced fresh food each day because of the direct and indirect impact of the market.\n\nDelray had around 23,000 residents in 1930 according to former residents, which is about the number in the two census divisions that encompassed the neighborhood that year. Delray reached its highest population density in that decade.\n\nA wastewater plant opened in the area in 1939, leading to demolition of houses in Delray causing the first major decrease in resident population. When I-75 was built in the 1950s and 1960s, many more houses in Delray were razed. The wastewater plant received an expansion in 1957, leading to more loss of houses.\n\nIn the 1990s the neighborhood dealt with large gang membership. Numerous gangs were targeted in policing efforts to control crime and recruitment including the Cobras, Cash Flow Posse, 138, Gangster Disciples, Latin Counts, Latin Kings, and the Delray Mafia.\n\nMany businesses in Delray closed during the late 2000s economic recession. In addition, around that time U.S. Steel had taken over nearby Zug Island. Many workers had been laid off during the recession. According to the 2000 census, 3,100 lived in Delray. John Carlisle (DetroitBloggerJohn) said in a 2009 article in the \"Detroit Metro Times\" that \"a foul stench\" was present in Delray due to the wastewater plant and the factories still operating. Due to EPA air pollution regulations, a number of air quality improvements have been made, but much of that was due to closings of antiquated facilities. Even so the transhipment industry grew which has comparatively little health impact, and a handful of warehouses near the Detroit Produce Terminal were converted into temperature-controlled storage facilities specifically for fruits such as bananas and pineapples.\n\nIn the 2010s, Delray gained attention in the state as a result of the debate over the Detroit River International Crossing, the construction of which would lead to the demolition of much of, if not the vast majority of, the blighted neighborhood.\n\nIn 2017, the city government offered to buy out houses in the bridge development zone, giving away empty houses outside of the bridge zone to people accepting the offer, plus paying up to $60,000 per household for renovation costs and foreclosing all taxes. Some families accepted the deal, and some refused. The Ambassador Bridge operators went to court to block evictions, but the court case was dismissed in May 2018. In July 2018, the builder of the bridge was selected, and clearance work in Delray will begin.\n\nThere were about 2,100 people according to Census estimates in 2014. about 33% of the population was non-Hispanic white, 33% was Hispanic, and 33% was black.\n\nIn 1897 Delray had about 5,000 people. In 1930 the population was about 24,000. This declined to 20,000 in 1940, over 17,000 in 1950, and under 13,000 in 1970.\n\nIn the early 20th Century the Delray-Springwells area served as the \"Little Hungary\" of Detroit and Michigan's Hungarian culture was centered in that community.\n\nIn 1898 the Michigan Malleable Iron Company began operations in Delray. Hungarian immigrants moved to Delray from cities including Cleveland, Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; and Toledo, Ohio, in order to get better working conditions and better wages. The first wave of Hungarian refugees came to the U.S. in order to escape the Austro-Hungarian Empire's political issues.\n\nIn 1904 a society to establish a Hungarian Lutheran church had about 60 members, There were also plans to establish a Catholic church, but by 1905 the Hungarians had difficulty agreeing on a final site. Later that year the Holy Cross Hungarian Church, a Hungarian Catholic church, opened in Delray. By 1911 about 5,000 Hungarians lived in Delray. In 1906 the Hungarian population began resisting the actions of the town police. In 1907 some Hungarians in Delray and Wyandotte who feared a lack of work returned to Hungary.\n\nAfter World War I a second wave of Hungarian refugees arrived, who emigrated due to religious and political reasons. Hungary had been reduced in size so many Magyars were escaping discrimination, intimidation and deprivation in the conquered lands of the former enemies of Hungary, often because of the roles they had played in the war. They selected Detroit because the automobile plants paid high wages. As the number of Hungarians in Delray increased, a new church of the Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic Church opened in 1925.\n\nIn 1935, Doanne Erdmann Beynon, author of \"Crime and Custom of the Hungarians of Detroit,\" wrote that \"it may be assumed\" that the Hungarian colony is within an area that extends from Fort Street to the Detroit River and from Clark Street to the Rouge River. He stated that even though the former Delray municipality had \"definite\" boundaries the boundary of the \"Hungarian colony of Delray\" was \"zonal\" and that the lines \"fade off indeterminately into areas that do not belong to the colony.\" He wrote that within this colony, immigrants from all parts of Hungary lived next to each other and did not settle in different areas according to their places of origin. The exception was an area on Barnes and Medina Streets called \"Magyar Negyed\" where the immigrants mainly originated from Sarud in Heves County. Beynon wrote that the residents preserved \"the peculiar customs and, to some extent, the costumes of the home village.\"\n\nBeynon wrote that in Delray the individual village cultures in Hungary were mixed into a new pan-Hungarian way of life in Delray. During the time Hungarians inhabited Delray, a common phrase was \"Within Delray the village life flows on\" (). Various Hungarian social clubs including athletic, altar, dramatic, sick benefit and insurance, singing (\"Dal\u00e1rd\u00e1k\"), and social clubs were formed. Each club included a membership and a wider group of adherents or \"p\u00e1rtol\u00f3k\". Beynon wrote that \"Practically every Hungarian of Detroit who has not broken away entirely from the people of his own nationality is connected in some way with one or more of these societies or clubs.\" As of 1935 many Hungarians in Delray had been socially isolated to the community and persons who had lived 15 to 20 years in Detroit had never visited the city center. Kossuth Day was celebrated in Delray.\n\nBeynon argued that due to Delray's fragmentation among many different wards it was \"not possible to determine from the population statistics published by the Bureau of the Census either the number of Hungarians resident within the colony or the population which these form of the total Hungarian population of Detroit.\" Using the Detroit Board of Education's Detroit City Census, Beynon concluded that in 1925, 45.46% of Detroit's Hungarian population lived in Delray. Using a list of Hungarian surnames in the \"Detroit City Directory\" published by the company Polk, Beynon concluded that 44.27% of the Hungarians lived in the Delray colony and 55.72% lived outside of the Delray colony.\n\nDuring the Great Depression the Daughters of Divine Charity served in a Hungarian-operated orphanage on South Street.\n\nFrom January 1, 1927, to March 11, 1932, the Wayne County Juvenile Court received 462 complaints filed against Hungarian boys, with a total of 380 boys involved. Of those boys, 140 were from the Delray Hungarian colony.\n\nOne wave of Hungarians arrived after the end of World War II. Another wave of Hungarians escaped the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, causing more to arrive in Delray. The construction of Interstate 75 in the mid-1960s destroyed large parts of Delray and divided the community into two pieces. Middle and working class Hungarians moved to Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, and Riverview. The Holy Cross parish school closed.\n\nThe Holy Cross Hungarian Church was scheduled to observe its 75th anniversary on September 17, 2000. By August of that year, renovations and polishing were underway.\n\nResidents of Delray are zoned to Detroit Public Schools (DPS). Clemente Elementary serves Delray for elementary school. All residents are zoned to Western International High School.\n\nFrom 1894\u20131999, James McMillan School was located on West End Street in central Delray. Originally opened as an elementary school, it was absorbed into DPS in 1907. It was converted into a high school but back into an elementary school for the district in 1916. McMillan Elementary School operated until the end of the 1999 school year, when DPS shut down the school. After it was closed, it remained unused with no intentions of being reopened. It subsequently became heavily vandalized and polluted, suffering a number of fires and eventually a gas line explosion, until the building itself was torn down in 2009. The neighborhood is home also to the now-abandoned Cary Elementary School.\n\nStudents at the elementary level (grades preK\u20135) previously attended Roberto Clemente Elementary or Phoenix Elementary. Students in grades 6\u20138 attended Mark Twain Elementary School or Earhart Middle School. High school students attended Southwestern High School or Western International High School. At 6921 West Fort Street, Southwestern High School can be considered part of the Delray neighborhood, although most properties along this stretch of Fort Street are not normally included as part of the Delray neighborhood.\n\nIn September 1907, Branch 8 of the Detroit Public Library system opened as the Delray Branch on West End Avenue. In January 1922, the branch was replaced with the James Valentine Campbell Branch on M-85 (West Fort Street). The branch operated until its closure in December 1996. In July 1999, the Campbell Annex Branch opened at the Holy Redeemer Cultural Center and closed in August 2004, only to reopen as the Campbell Branch at Lawndale Station. The neighborhood currently contains no libraries but is closest served by the Campbell Branch Library. It is located outside of the neighborbood at 8733 West Vernor in the Springwells neighborhood.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166084", "title": "Transaminase", "text": "Transaminases or aminotransferases are enzymes that catalyze a transamination reaction between an amino acid and an \u03b1-keto acid. They are important in the synthesis of amino acids, which form proteins.\n\nAn amino acid contains an amine (NH) group. A keto acid contains a keto (=O) group. In transamination, the NH group on one molecule is exchanged with the =O group on the other molecule. The amino acid becomes a keto acid, and the keto acid becomes an amino acid.\n\nMost transaminases are protein enzymes. However, some transamination activities of the ribosome have been found to be catalyzed by ribozymes (RNA enzymes). Examples being the hammerhead ribozyme, the VS ribozyme and the hairpin ribozyme.\n\nTransaminases require the coenzyme pyridoxal-phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxamine in the first half-reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid. Enzyme-bound pyridoxamine in turn reacts with pyruvate, oxaloacetate, or alpha-ketoglutarate, giving alanine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid, respectively. Many transamination reactions occur in tissues, catalysed by transaminases specific for a particular amino/keto acid pair. The reactions are readily reversible, the direction being determined by which of the reactants are in excess. This reversibility can be exploited for synthetic chemistry applications to achieve the synthesis of valuable chiral amines. The specific enzymes are named from one of the reactant pairs, for example; the reaction between glutamic acid and pyruvic acid to make alpha ketoglutaric acid and alanine is called glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or GPT for short.\n\nTissue transaminase activities can be investigated by incubating a homogenate with various amino/keto acid pairs. Transamination is demonstrated if the corresponding new amino acid and keto acid are formed, as revealed by paper chromatography. Reversibility is demonstrated by using the complementary keto/amino acid pair as starting reactants. After chromatogram has been taken out of the solvent the chromatogram is then treated with ninhydrin to locate the spots..\n\nAnimals must metabolize proteins to amino acids, at the expense of muscle tissue, when blood sugar is low. The preference of liver transaminases for oxaloacetate or alpha-ketoglutarate plays a key role in funneling nitrogen from amino acid metabolism to aspartate and glutamate for conversion to urea for excretion of nitrogen. In similar manner, in muscles the use of pyruvate for transamination gives alanine, which is carried by the bloodstream to the liver (the overall reaction being termed \"glucose-alanine cycle\"). Here other transaminases regenerate pyruvate, which provides a valuable precursor for gluconeogenesis. This alanine cycle is analogous to the Cori cycle, which allows anaerobic metabolism by muscles.\n\nThe transaminase enzymes are important in the production of various amino acids, and measuring the concentrations of various transaminases in the blood is important in the diagnosing and tracking many diseases. For example, the presence of elevated transaminases can be an indicator of liver and cardiac damage. Two important transaminase enzymes are aspartate transaminase (AST), also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT); and alanine transaminase (ALT), also called alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) or serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). These transaminases were discovered in 1954 and their clinical importance in 1955.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166093", "title": "August Heissmeyer", "text": "August Hei\u00dfmeyer (or Heissmeyer \u2013 11 January 1897 \u2013 16 January 1979), was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era.

After World War II, Hei\u00dfmeyer was tried and convicted as a \"major Nazi offender\". \n\nAfter finishing school, Hei\u00dfmeyer joined the Prussian military. In World War I, he was an infantry officer and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for bravery. After giving up his studies, he was employed as a driving teacher. In 1923 he first came into contact with the Nazi Party, which he joined in 1925. In early 1926, Hei\u00dfmeyer joined the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) where he was responsible for building up the \"SA-Gausturm Hannover-S\u00fcd\", and was for a time the acting \"Gauleiter\". In 1940 Hei\u00dfmeyer, previously married with six children in his custody, married Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the \"Reichsfrauenf\u00fchrerin\" (Reich Women's Leader), who had two previous marriages herself.\n\nHei\u00dfmeyer joined the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) in January 1930. From 1932, Hei\u00dfmeyer was posted to the SS Main Office, becoming its leader in 1935 and relieving Heinrich Himmler from that specific position. On 9 November 1936, Hei\u00dfmeyer was promoted to SS-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" (general) and Inspector of the National Political Institutes of Education. In 1939, Hei\u00dfmeyer was appointed \"SS Oberabschnittsleiter\" \"East\" and in 1940 as HSSPF (Higher SS and Police Leader) Spree, where he was in charge of the Berlin-Brandenburg area. \n\nAugust Hei\u00dfmeyer took over the command of the \"SS Totenkopf Standarte\" in 1940 from the outgoing Theodor Eicke, who in 1939 had begun commanding a combat SS division (SS Division Totenkopf) and therefore gave his supervision over the concentration camps back to the SS Leadership Main Office. Hei\u00dfmeyer was provisionally in charge of this bureau until May 1942. Richard Gl\u00fccks took over the position, and became the chief of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate. In April 1945, Hei\u00dfmeyer was given command of \"Kampfgruppe\" \"Hei\u00dfmeyer\", a collection of \"Volkssturm\" militia and Hitler Youth who were given the task of protecting the Spandau airfield outside Berlin.\n\nOn 29 February 1948, Hei\u00dfmeyer was arrested by French authorities near T\u00fcbingen and held for trial the following month.

He was a member of the cast of the 1963 Footlights revue \"A Clump of Plinths\", which was so successful during its run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that the revue transferred to the West End of London under the title of \"Cambridge Circus\" and later taken on tour to both New Zealand and Broadway in September 1964. Hatch was later a student teacher at Bloxham School, Oxfordshire.\n\nA BBC Radio production of \"Cambridge Circus\", entitled \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", launched many of the show's cast, including Hatch, into a radio comedy series of the same name. Meanwhile, he was responsible for the radio versions of \"Doctor in the House\", \"Doctor at Large\", \"Brothers in Law\" and \"All Gas and Gaiters\". Hatch co-devised the satirical show \"Week Ending\" and produced other comedy radio shows such as \"Just a Minute\", \"Hello, Cheeky!\", \"The Burkiss Way\", \"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves\", \"The Frankie Howerd Show\" (1974), and \"I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue\".\n\nSome of these overlapped with his earlier executive positions in the BBC: Radio Network Editor, BBC Manchester 1974\u201378; Head of Light Entertainment (Radio), BBC 1978\u201380; Controller, BBC Radio 2 1980\u201383; Controller, BBC Radio 4 1983\u201386; Director of Programmes, BBC Radio (later Network Radio, BBC) 1986\u201387, managing director 1987\u201393; Vice-Chairman, BBC Enterprises 1987\u201393; Adviser to the Director-General, BBC 1993\u201395. In 1990 he created the original Radio 5.\n\nHe was appointed CBE in the 1994 Birthday Honours for services to radio broadcasting.\n\nHatch left the Corporation and became Chairman of the National Consumer Council (1996\u20132000) and later of the Parole Board (2000\u201304) for England and Wales, for which he was knighted in 2003. In the latter role he caused consternation in some quarters in 2003 for describing Tony Martin, the farmer convicted of manslaughter, as a \"very dangerous man\" in a \"Times\" interview.\n\nHatch was also the chairman of SSVC (the Services Sound and Vision Corporation) between 1999 and 2004.

It billed itself as \"a 16-part series for young people and their families,\" with the target audience being primarily kids, preteens, teenagers, and young adults, and it was widely praised by educational groups. The series was later rerun by Nickelodeon in the mid-1980s.\n\nSet in Washington, D.C., \"Powerhouse\" is focused on the adventures of a racially and ethnically diverse group of five teenagers and one adult from the inner city, based at a former boxing and sports gym headquarters turned community center for kids and teens. The center was founded by Brenda Gaines, a woman who inherited the place from her late father, a former boxing champion. The basic theme of the series is that every person is a source of creativity and power. \u201cWe all have a Powerhouse deep down inside,\u201d it says in the theme song of the show.\n\nEach \"Powerhouse\" episode dealt with significant personal issues that affected both kids and teenagers such as alcoholism, peer pressure, physical fitness, and more, but they were combined with fast-paced action-adventure stories in which the group often had to solve a mystery or prevent a crime. For instance, in one episode they had to uncover the head of a racketeering operation that threatened to put Brenda and Powerhouse out of business. In another episode, they tried to track down the source of a potentially lethal food-poisoning epidemic, a task that took on even greater urgency when one of the group became infected.\n\nOne of \"Powerhouse's\" innovations was the use of what the show called Uncommercials. Since the show ran on PBS, which is commercial-free, the producers created 30- to 90-second commercial-like breaks that would air during the broadcast. Instead of selling products, uncommercials would sell a theme, often in entertaining or humorous ways.\n\nOne uncommercial, for example, featured a 12-year-old boy who asked, \u201cHow do I get a girl to like me?\u201d Several boys and girls of around the same age then offered suggestions. Another one asked, \u201cWhat is a friend?\u201d and several teenagers answered, one of which was future \"Saturday Night Live\" star Ana Gasteyer (her answer: \u201cSomeone you can be weird with.\u201d) in her first-ever TV appearance.\n\nAnother uncommercial featured Henry Winkler as a celebrity organ who gave advice on how to take care of your lungs.\n\nAnother popular uncommercial theme was \"Don't Just Sit There\u2014Do Something!\" which encouraged viewers to do something active or constructive.\n\nAnother \"Powerhouse\" feature was a salute to a particular youth organization, such as the Boy Scouts of America; these salutes preceded at least one of the uncommercials.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166103", "title": "Alex Seropian", "text": "Alexander Seropian (born 1969) is an American video game developer, one of the initial founders and later president of Bungie, the developer of the \"Marathon\", \"Myth\", and \"Halo\" video game series. Seropian became interested in computer programming in college and teamed up with fellow student Jason Jones to publish Jones's game \"\". The two became partners, and Bungie grew to become the best-known Apple Macintosh game developer before being bought by Microsoft in 2001.\n\nIn 2004, Seropian left Bungie and created Wideload Games, with the goal of streamlining game development. Wideload's small core development team worked with outside contractors to produce \"Stubbs the Zombie\" and \"Hail to the Chimp\". Wideload was acquired by Disney in 2009. As part of the deal Seropian became vice president of game development for Disney Interactive Studios. In 2012 he left the position to start Industrial Toys, a company focusing on mobile games.\n\nAlex Seropian attended the University of Chicago, and joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, where he met one of his future colleagues Jason Jones. Interested in computer programming, Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time. He graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. Before graduating, Seropian was living with his father, sleeping on his couch, and debating whether to get a job or create his own video game company. Seropian's father advised him to take a job to get experience, but the next day Seropian decided to found his own company. \"My dad is a master of reverse psychology\", Seropian said.\n\nSeropian's first game was a self-published \"Pong\"-clone called \"Gnop!\" for Apple Macintosh. The game was free, although a few customers paid $15 for the game's source code. In 1991 he founded Bungie and published his first commercial game, \"Operation Desert Storm\". Seropian sold 2,500 copies of the game, assembling the game boxes and mailing them out from his bedroom. Seropian partnered with his Artificial Intelligence classmate Jason Jones to publish Jones's nearly complete \"\"; the game sold around 2,500 copies\u2014it required a then-rare modem for network play\u2014it developed a devoted following. After publishing \"Minotaur\", the two formed a partnership.\n\nFor the next Bungie title, 1993's \"Pathways Into Darkness\", Seropian hired a third team member for graphics work. The game was the first three-dimensional texture-mapped game on the Mac and the first true first-person shooter. By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office\u2014a converted former religious school located in front of a crack house. Their next title, \"Marathon\", began development as a sequel to \"Pathways\" but grew larger. On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer.\n\nFor \"\", Seropian noted that the company had to incorporate new features such as surround sound and cinematics. \"Halo\" went on to sell more than 4\u00a0million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels, books, and music. Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family, but also due to frustrations with the game development process.\n\nSeropian founded his own studio in 2004 called Wideload Games, intended to be more streamlined than most video game studios. Calling the method of game development \"broken\", Wideload began with a staff of 10, with the plan to outsource the lion's share of development, to stay within budget. Seropian said that the idea came from figuring out that his decade-old assumptions about how to make games did not necessarily apply to the future. Seropian turned to the film industry for cues, saying that it helped to look at an older industry that had been solving the same types of problems for a longer period than video games. The external development model allowed Wideload to focus on the creative aspect of a project and added flexibility in what types of projects the team could take on. Wideload produced two games, 2005's \"Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse\" and 2008's \"Hail to the Chimp\".\n\nOn September 8, 2009 Disney acquired Wideload. Seropian joined Disney to head its in-house game development team, Disney Interactive Studios. The sale of Wideload was not originally planned: Wideload and Disney began working on a title together, and as conversations turned to a \"broader scope and vision\", the two companies \"discovered [they] had a lot in common,\" Seropian said. Seropian left Disney in February 2012. Seropian also serves as DePaul University's second \"game designer in residence\"; DePaul is the first liberal arts university to offer a bachelor's degree for game design.\n\nIn 2012, Seropian founded a studio named Industrial Toys. The company plans to develop mobile games for core gamers. The first title by Industrial Toys, \"Midnight Star\", was announced to be a sci-fi shooter designed with touch-based mobile platforms in mind\n, and debuted in February 2015.

He was Mayor of Cotonou from 2003 to 2015. Soglo is married to Rosine Vieyra Soglo, the Beninois former First Lady and politician.\n\nSoglo was born in Togo. After receiving degrees in law and economics from the University of Paris, Soglo returned to Benin (then called Dahomey) and was the inspector of finance (1965\u20131967) before his cousin, Colonel Christophe Soglo, overthrew President Sourou-Migan Apithy and appointed his relative minister of finance and economic affairs. Following the 1972 coup that brought Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou to power, he left the country and held positions at international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\n\nIn the late 1980s, faced with growing dissatisfaction over a stagnant economy, the K\u00e9r\u00e9kou government agreed to convene a national conference that would lead the country towards multiparty democracy. The conference designated Nic\u00e9phore Soglo Prime Minister, and he took office on March 12, 1990. The conference produced a constitution that was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum held on 2 December 1990.\n\nIn the country's first multiparty presidential election, Soglo took first place in the first round, held on March 10, 1991, with 36.31% of the vote. A run-off against K\u00e9r\u00e9kou followed on 24 March in which Soglo won a strong majority, receiving 67.73% of the vote\u2014the first time that an opposition candidate in post-colonial Francophone Africa had won a free election. He took office on April 4, 1991.\n\nIn the following year, the Renaissance Party of Benin (known by the acronym PRB or RB) was founded by Rosine Soglo; her husband became leader of the party in 1994.\n\nIn 1993, President Soglo headed the Benin delegation which participated in the first Tokyo International Conference on African Development.\n\nDuring his presidency, Soglo took efforts to refurbish Benin's devastated economy. These economic measures caused civil unrest and undermined his popularity. Despite these problems, his government was praised for its adherence to democratic principles and respect for human rights.\n\nIn the March 1996 presidential election, Soglo again took first place in the first round, but in the second round he was defeated by Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, receiving 47.51% of the vote. Soglo alleged election fraud, but this was rejected by the Constitutional Court.\n\nIn a bid to regain the presidency in the March 2001 election, he placed second behind Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, winning 27.12% of the vote. Although Soglo qualified to participate in a run-off against K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, he withdrew alleging irregularities, which resulted in a K\u00e9r\u00e9kou victory. Soglo could not run again in the March 2006 presidential election due to the age limit of 70 years; his son Lehady Soglo ran as the candidate of the Renaissance Party instead, placing fourth with 8.44% of the vote. Another son, Ganiou, also ran in the election, but he fared poorly, receiving only about 0.17% of the vote.\n\nNic\u00e9phore Soglo and the RB were victorious in the December 2002\u2013January 2003 municipal election in Cotonou, Benin's largest city. In the 12th arrondissement, Soglo defeated pro-government Movement candidate S\u00e9v\u00e9rin Adjovi. Soglo was elected as Mayor by the city's council on February 13, 2003, receiving the support of 41 of the 45 councillors, and he was sworn in on the same day. He said that he would focus on reducing pollution and improving waste management and drainage.\n\nWhile hospitalized at the American Hospital of Paris, located in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Soglo was falsely reported to have died in February 2005. Along with former United States President Jimmy Carter, Soglo headed the multinational delegation of the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center for the October 2005 Liberian election.\n\nSoglo ran for re-election as a municipal councillor in the April 2008 local election in Cotonou; he was also the RB candidate for Mayor, vowing to continue to modernize the city and create a system of public transportation. He faced J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dandjinou of the governing Cauris Forces for an Emerging Benin. Following the local election, the municipal councillors re-elected Soglo as Mayor on June 3, 2008.

The community is located along Allatoona Creek, southeast of Cartersville. It was once a small mining community until a dam was erected at the base of the Etowah river, completely flooding the town of Allatoona.\n\nAllatoona was first founded in 1838. One of the first official buildings was a small post office that was active until 1918. Before the emergence of the civil war, the town became increasingly popular, people started coming to the town in search of gold and other resources; a silver mine was also located nearby that also brought miners to the small town. As well as a blacksmith, a small depot and a dry goods store. A small Universalist church was built in 1910 which also functioned as a schoolhouse. The town later expanded and added a new school house site which would be located just a half mile southeast of the railroad that ran through town. John Clayton was among the first settlers to the town of Allatoona he was a rich slave owner and owned several plantations around the area. Several of the founders including John Clayton are buried in the cemetery adjacent to the church. The graves of founders and other town folk can still be visited to this day. Allatoona was also considered both an agricultural community and transportation crossroads established along Allatoona Creek at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains and best known for the battle of Allatoona Pass.\n\nAfter the Battle of Atlanta Southern Confederates wanted to stop General Sherman and his army of Northern troops. General Sherman aimed to finish his march to the sea; conquering every town that his army encountered. The leader of the Confederate army, General Hood, and his soldiers were ordered to destroy the railroad that ran through the town of Allatoona. Doing so would weaken any chance of the Union army to finish taking control of other southern towns. On the morning of October 5, 1864, a battle in the town of Allatoona took place, as Confederate troops approached Allatoona pass they were outnumbered by union troops at 2,000 to 1,944. Confederate soldiers in an attempt to fight off the larger number of Union troops resorted to rocks and hand-to-hand combat to secure the town of Allatoona for the south. John Claytons plantation home, known as the Clayton-Mooney house was used as a union headquarters as well as a makeshift hospital during the battle. During the battle, the Confederate Army had received a tip that the Union army would have more reinforcements and that they would be overtaken by the Union army. General Hood had made the decision to pull his troops from battle, and thus ended up defeated. The confederate army lost to the union because of false information they had received. It is known as one of the civil wars bloodiest battle due to the duration of the battle which approximately lasted 6\u20138 hours. Also making it one of the civil wars shortest battles. The Clayton-Mooney home, circa 1836, is the only structure still standing that is a reminder of days gone by. Bloodstains and bullet holes are still able to be seen today and serve as a reminder of the events that took place in Allatoona.\n\nAllatoona dam is located at the base of the Etowah River and approximately a mile off of Interstate 75. It is roughly 30 miles from downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The first official recognition that the present dam site on the Etowah River near Cartersville, Georgia, was a prime location for a hydropower project was in a document entitled, \"Reports on Examination and Survey of Etowah, Coosa, Tallapoosa and Alabama Rivers\", prepared in 1910 by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Lake Allatoona was authorized by the Flood Control Acts of 1941 and 1946 The town of Allatoona was scheduled to be destroyed to allow for the construction of the dam. As the dam was officially being started it was a fast moving project, the construction of the dam took place prior to World War ll. When the US joined WWII construction on the dam had to be put on hold. Once the war ended work was restarted on the dam on February 8, 1946; instead of the Army Corps finishing the project they opted for hired laborers to complete the dam. The lake began to fill just after Christmas in 1949. By May 1950, the lake was full, with 12,010 acres of water and 270 miles of shoreline. The power plant began operation on January 31, 1950. The dam serves several functions; including seven authorized purposes such as: flood control, hydropower generation, water supply, recreation, fish and wildlife management, water quality, and Navigation. Before the dam was built the town of Allatoona and other surrounding areas would occasionally flood causing extensive damage throughout the town. The addition of Allatoona Dam has prevented nearly $80 million in flood damages since 1950. The total cost of the Allatoona Dam project for construction, land, and relocation was $31,500,000 in 1950. That's roughly $300 million in 2013 dollars. The Allatoona dam is approximately 1,250 feet in length and the maximum height above the existing riverbed is 190 feet. An 18-foot wide roadway is provided across the entire length of the dam.\n\nWith the installation of the dam and the town of Allatoona now transformed into a lake, the surrounding areas were converted for recreational use. Several beaches, campgrounds, and cabins are scattered throughout the area. Around the shores of Allatoona there are 25 parks, 8 marinas and 10 campgrounds. There are several parks used for daily use on Lake Allatoona and the Etowah River. The surrounding land is ideal for families and sees large surges of guests every year. Out of the dozens of parks at Allatoona two of those are handicap accessible so that all patrons can still take part in lake activities. In 1998, Lake Allatoona clocked more visitor hours than any of the other 450 Corps of Engineers projects in the United States.\u00a0In the 1980s during a drought that affected Bartow County and other regions, the water level of the lake reached an all-time low due to the dry conditions. During the peak of the drought, onlookers were able to see the old roads, remnants of houses and tree stumps clearly visible from above water. Presently the park is managed and maintained by Red Top Mountain State Park.\n"}, {"id": "2166156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166156", "title": "Andronikov Monastery", "text": "Andronikov Monastery of the Saviour (, or ) is a former monastery on the left bank of the Yauza River in Moscow, consecrated to the Holy Image of Saviour Not Made by Hands and containing the oldest extant (i.e. outside the Kremlin) building in Moscow. It is home to Andrei Rublev Museum of Old Russian Art, named after the most famous monk of this abbey.\n\nThe monastery was established in 1357 by Metropolitan Alexis as a way of giving thanks for his survival in a storm. Its first hegumen was Saint Andronik, one of Sergii Radonezhsky's disciples. The extant four-pillared Saviour Cathedral was constructed from 1420\u20131427. The great medieval painter Andrei Rublev spent the last years of his life at the monastery and was buried there. In addition, one of the largest mass graves for lay brothers (called , \"skudelnitsa\") was located on the cloister's premises.\n\nIn the second half of the 14th century, a monastic quarter formed outside the walls of the Andronikov Monastery, which started producing bricks for the ongoing construction of the Moscow Kremlin (1475). From its beginning, Andronikov Monastery was one of the centres of book copying in Muscovy. Manuscript collection of the cloister included most of the works by Maximus the Greek. In August 1653, archpriest Avvakum was held under arrest at this monastery.\n\nAndronikov Monastery has been ransacked on numerous occasions (1571, 1611, 1812). In 1748 and 1812, its archives were lost in fires. In the 19th century, there were a theological seminary and a library on the cloister's premises. In 1917, there were seventeen monks and one novice in the monastery.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Andronikov Monastery was closed. One of the first Cheka's penal colonies (mostly, for foreign nationals) was located within the walls of the monastery.\n\nIn 1928, the Soviets destroyed the necropolis of the Andronikov Monastery, where Andrei Rublev and soldiers of the Great Northern War and the Patriotic War had been interred. In 1947, however, Andronikov Monastery was declared a national monument.\n\nIn 1985, the Andrei Rublev Central Museum of Ancient Russian Culture and Art was opened on the cloister's premises. In 1991, the Saviour cathedral was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. Archaeological excavations on the cloister's territory in 1993 uncovered an ancient altar and other relics.\n\nSince the 1930s, when the Communists destroyed the 14th-century Saviour Cathedral in the Wood, the monastery's cathedral has attracted a renewed interest as the oldest preserved in Moscow. Consequently, its present outlook is the result of a controversial Soviet restoration (1959\u20131960), which sought to remove all additions from later periods. Nothing but traces of the frescoes by Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny remain visible on its walls.\n\nThe second oldest monument (1504\u20131506) in the abbey is a spacious refectory, the third largest such structure after those in the Palace of Facets and Joseph-Volotsky Monastery. The adjacent baroque church was commissioned by Eudoxia Lopukhina in 1694 to commemorate the birth of her son, Tsarevich Alexis, and contains a burial vault of the Lopukhin family.\n\nMassive 17th-century walls and towers are reminiscent of the period when the monastery defended the eastern approaches against the Moscow Kremlin. In 1795, they started a Neoclassical belltower, one of the tallest in Moscow. This astonishing belfry was destroyed in 1929\u20131932, and its bricks were subsequently reused in construction of nearby buildings.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166164", "title": "The Long Emergency", "text": "The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-first Century is a book by James Howard Kunstler (Grove/Atlantic, 2005) exploring the consequences of a world oil production peak, coinciding with the forces of climate change, resurgent diseases, water scarcity, global economic instability and warfare to cause major trouble for future generations.\n\nThe book's principal theme explores the effects of a peak in oil production, predicted by many geologists, on American society as well as the rest of the world. In both this book and in his other writings, Kunstler argues that the economic upheavals caused by peak oil will force Americans to live in more localized, self-sufficient communities.\n\nKunstler's premise is that \"cheap, plentiful\" oil is the foundation of industrial society and the pervasiveness of its effects is not widely appreciated. Through the 21st century, oil and natural gas will become increasingly difficult to obtain, becoming increasingly expensive and ultimately unavailable. Scarcity of petroleum will cause significant problems for transportation and generation of electrical power. In addition, shipping of food and manufactured items will become increasingly expensive, ultimately prohibitively so. Also, natural gas is vitally important to food production as it is the raw material for much of commercial crop fertilizers. In the industrialized West, most food production and manufacturing is performed far from, and generally abstracted away from the consumer.\n\nThe author further argues that alternative sources of energy will be insufficient. As petroleum sources become scarce, environmentally harmful or risky technologies such as coal and nuclear will become necessary but not sufficient for our energy needs. Hydroelectric, solar, and wind power, even in combination with coal and nuclear, will also be far from sufficient. Kunstler does not consider hydrogen to be a true energy source since one cannot drill into the earth and obtain hydrogen. Hydrogen must be extracted from other energy sources, such as natural gas or using electricity at a total net loss of energy.\n\nKunstler states that, as energy becomes scarce, transportation will become difficult or impossible, causing food and other necessary commodities to become unavailable in many communities. It will be necessary for local communities to become self-sufficient for food production, but many communities will be unable to do so, particularly large cities. The result will be mass starvation, disease, and civil unrest. Kunstler suggests that governments will be incapable of managing these problems. This period of scarcity and collapse will possibly last for hundreds of years, hence the \"long\" emergency of the book's title.\n\nKunstler, a long-time critic of suburban design, advises people should begin learning to grow food.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166166", "title": "Division of Reid", "text": "The Division of Reid is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.\n\nThe division is named after the Right Honourable Sir George Reid, a former Premier of New South Wales and the fourth Prime Minister of Australia. The division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 13 September 1922, and was first contested at the 1922 federal election.\n\nUnder initial proposals for the 2009 redistribution, the Australian Electoral Commission proposed that the division be abolished. However, in the final proposal, the name \"Reid\" was retained for a division combining much of the now-abolished Division of Lowe with part of the old Division of Reid.\n\nWhile the old Reid was historically a safe Labor seat, the 2009 redistribution made Reid far less safe for Labor, with its majority being slashed by six percent. That was partly because of the addition of territory from Lowe, which had been a marginal Labor seat for most of the time since the 1980s. John Murphy, the last member for Lowe, retained Reid for Labor at the 2010 election with just a two percent margin, after suffering an eight percent swing. At the 2013 election, the seat was won for the first time by the Liberal Party of Australia.\n\nProminent members representing the division include Jack Lang who, like Reid, was a former Premier of New South Wales, Tom Uren, a deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party, and Laurie Ferguson, the son of Jack Ferguson, who was a Deputy Premier of New South Wales, and the brother of Martin Ferguson, a former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments.

His formative experiences as Christian missionary and educator in early 20th century China shaped his life's work. Although he did not learn the Chinese language, he became known for his magisterial scholarly surveys of the history of world Christianity, the history of China, and of American relations with East Asia.\n\nLatourette was born in Oregon City, Oregon, the son of DeWitt Clinton Latourette and Ella (Scott) Latourette. His mother and father both attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, where they graduated in 1878. DeWitt Clinton Latourette was a lawyer in Oregon City.\n\nIn 1904, Latourette was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree from Linfield College in Oregon. He continued his education in New Haven, Connecticut at Yale, earning a BA in 1906, an MA in 1907 and PhD in 1909.\n\nFrom 1909 through 1910, Latourette served as a traveling secretary for the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. In 1910, he joined the faculty of Yale-in China's Yali School at Changsha in Hunan Province. He began to study the Chinese language, but in the summer of 1911 he contracted a severe case of amoebic dysentery and was forced to return to the United States.\n\nAs he began his recovery, Latourette joined the faculty at Reed College in Portland, Oregon; and from 1914 through 1916, he was a professor of history at Reed. In 1916, he accepted a position at Denison University, an institution with Baptist affiliations, in Granville, Ohio. His time at Denison lasted from 1916 through 1921. In 1918, while at Denison, Latourette was ordained as a Baptist minister.\n\nLatourette joined the faculty of the Yale University Divinity School in 1921. Latourette lived in a college dormitory suite during his time at Yale. He welcomed student groups to meet in the living room and was known as \"Uncle Ken.\" He accepted appointment as the D. Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity (1921\u20131949), and he was later made the Sterling Professor of Missions and Oriental History (1949\u20131953). In 1938, he was named Chairman of the Department of Religion at Yale. He took on greater responsibilities in 1946 as Director of Graduate Studies at the Yale Divinity School. From his retirement in 1953 until his death in 1968, he was Sterling Professor Emeritus at the Divinity School.\n\nLatourette was killed at age 84 when an automobile accidentally hit him in front of his family home in Oregon City, Oregon.\n\nLatourette served as president of the American Historical Association, the Association for Asian Studies, the American Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society and the Japan International Christian University Foundation.\n\nHe was a leader in the ecumenical movement, and he held leadership positions in the American Baptist Missionary Union, the International Board of the Y.M.C.A., the United Board for Christian Colleges in China and the World Council of Churches.\n\nThroughout his life he remained active in the Yale-in-China Association.\n\nAt the Yale Divinity School, the \"Latourette Initiative\" is a proactive program to preserve and provide access to the documentation of world Christianity.

Bottle episodes are usually shot on sets built for other episodes, frequently the main interior sets for a series, and consist largely of dialogue and scenes for which no special preparations are needed. They are commonly used when one script has fallen through and another has to be written at short notice, or because of budgetary constraints. Bottle episodes have also been used for dramatic effect, with the limited setting and cast allowing for a slower pace and deeper exploration of character traits and motives.\n\nThe term \"bottle show\" was coined by Leslie Stevens, creator and executive producer of 1960s TV series \"The Outer Limits\", for an episode made in very little time at very little cost, \"as in pulling an episode right out of a bottle like a genie\". The earliest known use of \"bottle \"episode\"\" is 2003.\n\nBottle episodes are sometimes produced when a show has a mid-season cliffhanger or an inexpensive season opener/closer, to allow as much of the budget as possible to go to the more expensive episodes. Scott Brazil, executive producer/director of \"The Shield\", described bottle episodes as \"the sad little stepchild whose allowance is docked in order to buy big brother a new pair of sneaks\".\n\n\"Seinfeld\"s \"The Chinese Restaurant\" was reportedly refused by NBC numerous times, almost causing Larry David to leave the show. The episode, the only pure Seinfeld bottle episode, is viewed as a classic and \u201cbroke new ground\u201d for both the show and sitcoms.\n\nThe third season premiere of The West Wing was delayed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. When the season did return, the first episode was a bottle episode titled \"Isaac and Ishmael\", in which the main cast paid tribute to those affected by the attacks and informed viewers about what to expect from the delayed premiere. Set almost entirely in the White House Mess Hall, the main characters explore the motivations and nuances of terrorism.\n\nThe popularity of the \"Friends\" bottle episode \"The One Where No One's Ready\" led the producers to create at least one bottle episode in each season.\n\nThe bottle episode on \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\", \"The Box\", is rated as one of the best by its viewers. It is currently the joint highest-rated episode of the series (9.5/10) on IMDB. \n\nSeveral early episodes of \"The X-Files\" were conceived as bottle episodes, including \"Space\", \"Darkness Falls\", and the well-received \"Ice\", although these ran over budget.\n\nBottle episodes from \"Star Trek: The Original Series\" (\"Star Trek: TOS\") are known for occasionally becoming popular with fans. Examples include \"Charlie X\", \"Journey to Babel\", \"\", \"Elaan of Troyius\", and \"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\". The phenomenon has persisted to a lesser extent in later incarnations, with \"\" (\"\") being celebrated by Startrek.com and Amazon.com\u2014among other sources\u2014as \"[a]rguably one of the best episodes of \"Deep Space Nine\" and a jewel in the entire \"Trek\" canon\".\n\nThe third story of \"Doctor Who\", \"The Edge of Destruction\", was a bottle episode created in different circumstances from most. The series had been picked up for thirteen episodes by the BBC, and the previous two stories had contained eleven episodes between them; hence, a two-part story was needed. It only featured the main cast of four. \"Doctor Who\" has also had occasional bottle episodes since then, most notably \"Midnight\", which, apart from bookend scenes at a holiday resort, is set entirely on a shuttle bus, with a monster depicted only via sound effects and the acting of the guest cast.\n\nThe third-season episode \"Fly\" of \"Breaking Bad\" features only two members of the main cast (plus a few extras) and takes place almost exclusively in the secret laboratory used to cook crystal methamphetamine. Series creator Vince Gilligan has referred to this as a bottle episode, noting that the limited setting and cast allowed for a slower pace and deeper exploration of character traits and motives:\n\nEven if financial realities didn't enter into it, I feel as a showrunner that there should be a certain shape and pace to each season, and the really high highs that you try to get to at the end of a season\u2014the big dramatic moments of action and violence, the big operatic moments you're striving for\u2014I don't think would land as hard if you didn't have the moments of quiet that came before them. The quiet episodes make the tenser, more dramatic episodes pop even more than they usually would just by their contrast.\n\n\"Archer\"s Season 6, Episode 5, \"Vision Quest\", features seven of the eight major cast members stuck in an elevator in real time.\n\nThe comedy-drama series \"Leverage\" had three bottle episodes. \"The Bottle Job\" (season 2, episode 11) uses only three locations: Nathan Ford's (Timothy Hutton) apartment; McRory's, the bar it sits over; and the bar's backroom. It also alludes to the concept by forcing the Leverage team to execute a late betting or \"wire\" con, which normally takes days or weeks just to set up, in only an hour and a half; Ford explicitly calls it \"the wire in a bottle\". (Ford, a recovering alcoholic, also reverts to drinking as part of the con; \"hitting the bottle\" is an expression for heavy drinking.) \"The Cross My Heart Job\" (season 4, episode 9) sees the team confined to an airport with no equipment or other resources, fighting to stop a transplant heart from going to a terminally ill defense contractor who's had it stolen from its intended recipient. And finally, \"The Broken Wing Job\" (season 5, episode 8) has Parker (Beth Riesgraf) working to foil a kidnapping while stuck at home with a broken leg, while the rest of the team is on a job in Japan.\n\nA meta-example is \"Community\"s Season 2, Episode 8, \"Cooperative Calligraphy\". After the opening, characters Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) and Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) both refer to the situation as a bottle episode. The entire episode is set inside a study room of the college with only the main cast. Its plot centers around the pen of the character Annie Edison (Alison Brie) going missing as she refuses to let anyone else leave the study room until they come forward with it. \n\nAnother meta-example is \"Teen Titans Go!\"s Season 3, Episode 29, \"Bottle Episode\". Its plot centers around the main characters being trapped in a literal glass bottle, and passing the time by reminiscing about previous episodes (making it also a clip show). The episode breaks the fourth wall multiple times with dialogue referencing the expense of television production, giving production staff a break, and the need to fill episodes that fall through.\n\nThe adult-animated sci-fi sitcom \"Rick and Morty\" has a bottle episode called \"Rixty Minutes\". In it, the Smith family alternates between watching the lives of alternate versions of themselves on special goggles and commercials on the TV, the latter being entirely improvised sketches by co-creator Justin Roiland.\n\nThe anime series \"Hyouka\" has a bottle episode titled \"Anyone Who Knows\". In it, H\u014dtar\u014d challenges Eru to come up with a random mystery to prove that a theory can be created out of anything. The entire episode is set in a school classroom and focuses on the two main characters.\n\nThe episodes \"My Coffee With Niles\" and \"Dinner Party\" of the sitcom \"Frasier\" are notable bottle episodes, each taking place entirely on a single set (the fictional coffee shop Cafe Nervosa, and Frasier's apartment, respectively) and featuring minimal or no guest actors.\n\nThe episode \u201cTrain Station\u201d of the BBC \"mockumentary\" \"This Country\" is a bottle episode almost entirely set on a bench on a railway station platform. It features the two main characters, Kerry and Kurtan, bickering as they await the return of their friend the Vicar from a week away in Bristol.\n\nThe \"Peep Show\" episode Nether Zone (series 7, episode 4) takes place almost entirely inside a block of flats, as Mark and Jez are locked inside, unable to get to Mark's baby's christening.\n\nIn the seventh season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation titled \"Leslie and Ron\", the Parks & Recreation gang finds Leslie and Ron's rivalry cumbersome and locks them in a room together to hash things out.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166188", "title": "Adjuvilo", "text": "Adjuvilo is a constructed language created in 1910 by Claudius Colas under the pseudonym of \"Profesoro V.

Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi's example resulted in a nationwide movement of book donations to the library.\n\nIn 1808, the Hungarian National Assembly (\"Diet\") created the Hungarian National Museum to collect the historical, archaeological and natural relics of Hungary. The Museum was merged into the Library and for the last 200 years this is how it has existed, a national depository for written, printed and objective relics of the Hungarian past.\n\nIn 1846, the Hungarian National Museum moved into its new building but it was not until 1949 that the Library became a separate entity again, with its current name. In 1985, the library moved to its new home at the Buda Castle Palace. The NSZL works on its catalogue's semantic availability.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, a Hungarian librarian discovered four pages of Mozart's original score (autograph) of the sonata in Budapest's National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library. Until then, only the last page of the autograph survived. The paper and handwriting of the four pages matched that of the final page of the score, held in Salzburg. Zolt\u00e1n Kocsis gave the first performance of the discovered score in September 2014.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166202", "title": "A Latin Dictionary", "text": "A Latin Dictionary (or Harpers' Latin Dictionary, often referred to as Lewis and Short or L&S) is a popular English-language lexicographical work of the Latin language, published by Harper and Brothers of New York in 1879 and printed simultaneously in the United Kingdom by Oxford University Press. Since 2020, it has been published by Nigel Gourlay, Chapel-en-le-Frith.\n\nThe work is usually referred to as Lewis and Short after the names of its editors, Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short. It was derived from the 1850 English translation by Ethan Allen Andrews of an earlier Latin-German dictionary, \"W\u00f6rterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache\", by the German philologist Wilhelm Freund, in turn based on I.J.G. Scheller\u2019s Latin\u2013German dictionary of 1783. The Andrews translation was partially revised by Freund himself, then by Henry Drisler, and was finally edited by Short and Lewis.\n\nThe division of labour between the two editors was remarkably unequal. Short, a very thorough but slow worker, produced material for the letters A through C, but B and C were lost by Harpers, meaning that his work now only appears in the letter A (216 pages), while Lewis, who worked in the time he could spare from his law practice, was solely responsible for the entries beginning with the letters B through Z (1803 pages). In 1890 Lewis published a heavily abridged version of the dictionary, entitled \"An Elementary Latin Dictionary,\" for the use of students. Sometimes called the \"Elementary Lewis,\" it is still in print today.\n\nThe adoption of the book by Oxford University Press was the result of the failure of its own project to create a new Latin-English dictionary in 1875. Henry Nettleship and John Mayor had been commissioned to produce a new Latin dictionary based on a fresh reading of the sources, but after Mayor withdrew from the project, Nettleship was unable to complete it on his own; he eventually published his research as notes on Lewis and Short. While the Press had earlier published John Riddle\u2019s 1835 translation of Scheller\u2019s Latin\u2013German dictionary, this was a much more expensive book. The Press thus adopted \"Harpers' Latin Dictionary\" as a stopgap measure, paying Harper and Brothers 10 per cent royalties. Harper and Brothers sold its rights to the American Book Company in 1899, shortly before its bankruptcy.\n\nFrom the time of its publication, many scholars have criticized the dictionary for its errors and inconsistencies. Because of various circumstances, however, no replacement was attempted until 1933, with the \"Oxford Latin Dictionary\", which was completed in 1983. Lewis and Short was out of print from the mid-1960s, with booksellers relying on existing stocks of the dictionary, and the second-hand market; in 2020, the dictionary was reprinted under a new publisher.\n\nThe dictionary's full text is available on-line from the Perseus Project. Lewis and Short is also available for offline consultation, by means of various applications.\n\nAmong classicists, Lewis and Short has been largely superseded by the \"Oxford Latin Dictionary\", called the OLD for short. Lewis and Short incorporated material from existing Latin dictionaries; the \"OLD\", by contrast, started from scratch, following procedures similar to those of the well-regarded \"Oxford English Dictionary\". Thanks to the increased availability of modern editions, the \"OLD\" editors had access to a larger variety of classical works. Although classicists still consult Lewis and Short, they tend to prefer the \"OLD\".\n\nOn the other hand, Lewis and Short remains a standard reference work for medievalists, renaissance specialists, and early modernists, as the dictionary covers Late and Medieval Latin, if somewhat inconsistently. The \"OLD\", when used on its own, rarely meets their needs, since it was decided early in the \"OLD\"'s planning that the work would not encompass works written later than AD 200. A few exceptions were made for especially important texts from the late classical period, such as Augustine's \"De Civitate Dei\", but for periods later than that the \"OLD\" is considerably less useful. The \"Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources\" supplements the \"OLD\" for medieval usage of Latin words.\n\nIn cases where Lewis and Short do not answer a medieval usage question, J. F. Niermeyer's \"Mediae Latinitatis Lexicon Minus\" often supplies an answer. The \"Lexicon Minus\" was completed in 1976 by C. van de Kieft after Niermeyer's death, and has since become a standard reference work. More recent editions of the \"Lexicon Minus\" have corrections and expansions; also, in later editions all words are defined in English, French and German, making it of greater international importance than Lewis and Short. The \"Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis\" completed in 1678 by Charles du Fresne (commonly referred to as Du Cange after the author's title, the \"Sieur du Cange\") is now less frequently used, as Niermeyer's \"Lexicon Minus\" incorporates much of its information.\n\nOn occasion people confuse Lewis and Short (or L&S) with Liddell and Scott, its Greek counterpart, entitled \"A Greek\u2013English Lexicon\". The 1945 and later editions of Liddell and Scott are commonly referred to by the abbreviation LSJ after the names of its editors Liddell, Scott and the editor of the 1945 revision, Jones.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166208", "title": "Baharestan", "text": "Baharestan () is the name given to the historic Iranian parliament building, inaugurated in 1906 (see Persian Constitutional Revolution).

His works have included numerous musicals, movie, television themes and hit songs. He has provided lyrics for John Barry, Charles Strouse, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Quincy Jones, Hoyt Curtin, Lulu, Jule Styne, Henry Mancini, Meat Loaf, Michael Jackson, Elmer Bernstein, Michel Legrand, Hayley Westenra, A. R. Rahman, Marvin Hamlisch and Debbie Wiseman.\n\nAllMusic stated that \"Black is perhaps best-known for his collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber, and for the James Bond theme songs he co-wrote with composer John Barry: \"Thunderball\", \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and \"The Man with the Golden Gun\".\"\n\nBlack was born Donald Blackstone in London, England, the youngest of five children of Russian Jewish immigrants Morris and Betsy (n\u00e9e Kersh) Blackstone. His father worked as a garment presser and his mother in a clothes shop and during his childhood the family lived in a council flat in Tornay House, Shore Place, South Hackney. He attended Cassland Road School and enjoyed visits to the Hackney Empire, which was then a music hall and to the cinema to watch James Cagney films.\n\nHe began his music industry career as an office boy with a music publishing firm, and later worked as a song-plugger. He also had a brief spell as a comic.\n\nHe was personal manager to the singer Matt Monro for many years and also provided songs for him (usually writing English language lyrics to continental songs). These included \"Walk Away\" (music: Udo J\u00fcrgens) and \"For Mamma\" (music: Charles Aznavour).\n\nBlack's first film work was the lyrics for the theme of the James Bond entry \"Thunderball\" (1965). His association with the Bond series continued over several decades, with \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", in collaboration with John Barry, and Surrender for \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" and \"The World Is Not Enough\", in collaboration with David Arnold.\n\nBlack's film work culminated when he collaborated with Barry on the title song of 1966's \"Born Free\", which won the Oscar for Best Song and provided a hit for Matt Monro. Pianist Roger Williams made the US Top 40 with an instrumental version. The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1967 Grammy Awards. The movie's producer, Sam Jaffe, was not impressed with the song, fearing that Black had made too much of a political comment in the lyric, and initially had the film printed without it on the soundtrack. When it became a US hit, he relented and had the film reprinted, commenting to Black, \"It grows on you,\" after the song won the Oscar.\n\nBlack later collaborated with Barry on \"The Tamarind Seed\", \"Out of Africa\", \"Dances with Wolves\", and an ill-fated Broadway musical, \"The Little Prince and the Aviator\". In 1967, Lulu took the Black-Mark London title song of the film \"To Sir, with Love\" to No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Black received his second Oscar nomination for Best Song with the title theme, written with Elmer Bernstein, of the 1969 John Wayne western, \"True Grit\". That same year, he partnered with Quincy Jones for the theme song of the Michael Caine film, \"The Italian Job\", \"On Days Like These\". He received a third Oscar nomination for the title song of the 1972 film \"Ben\", a US No. 1 hit for Michael Jackson, which Black had written with Walter Scharf. Further Oscar nominations came for \"Wherever Love Takes Me\" (music: Elmer Bernstein), from 1974 film \"Gold\", and \"Come to Me\" (music: Henry Mancini) from 1976's \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\".\n\nIn addition, Black teamed with Charles Strouse on the songs \"Growing Up Isn't Easy\" and \"Anything Can Happen On Halloween\" for the 1986 HBO film \"The Worst Witch\", based on the children's book by Jill Murphy.\n\nBlack's stage credits include the musicals \"Billy\" (music: John Barry), \"Bar Mitzvah Boy\" (music: Jule Styne), \"Dear Anyone\" (music: Geoff Stephens), \"Budgie\" (music: Mort Shuman) and several Andrew Lloyd Webber shows: the 1979 song-cycle, \"Tell Me on a Sunday\", which was performed by Marti Webb (whom Black also managed for a time); \"Aspects of Love\", which propelled Michael Ball to stardom; and, together with Christopher Hampton, the musical adaptation of the Billy Wilder film \"Sunset Boulevard\". The latter brought Black and Hampton a Tony Award for Best Book.\n\n\"Tell Me on a Sunday\" was incorporated into \"Song and Dance\". This was later adapted for a Broadway production starring Bernadette Peters, for which she won a Tony award as Best Actress in a Musical. Sarah Brightman released \"Unexpected Song\", from that musical, as a single.\n\nWith Geoff Stephens he produced a concept album of a 'revuesical' entitled \"Off The Wall\".\n\nIn 2002, he worked with the Indian composer A. R. Rahman on the musical \"Bombay Dreams\". In 2004, Black's second musical collaboration with Hampton, Frank Wildhorn's \"Dracula, the Musical\", debuted on Broadway. He also collaborated with John Barry once more, on the musical \"Brighton Rock\". Based on the Graham Greene novel, it debuted at the Almeida Theatre, London, in 2004. In 2006, Black created the lyrics for the musical adaptation of the book \"Feather Boy\", for the National Theatre in London.\n\nIn 2011, Black wrote the lyrics alongside composer Frank Wildhorn for the 2011 Broadway production of \"Bonnie & Clyde\" which premiered at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on 22 November 2011 and closed four weeks later due to poor ticket sales, despite the general public giving the show high praise for its soundtrack and the lead actors Jeremy Jordan (as Clyde Barrow) and Laura Osnes (as Bonnie Parker). The soundtrack however became one of Wildhorn and Black's most successful musical scores.\n\nIn 2013, he again worked with Christopher Hampton and Andrew Lloyd Webber on \"Stephen Ward the Musical\". In 2015, he wrote the lyrics for \"Mrs Henderson Presents\", with George Fenton and Simon Chamberlin composing the music.\n\nSince the retirement and death of BBC broadcaster David Jacobs in 2013, Black has presented the Sunday night slot vacated by Jacobs on BBC Radio 2. His show features classic songs and songwriters of the 20th century, pays a weekly tribute to Matt Monro, whom he managed, and includes many of his showbiz encounter stories.\n\nIn 1993, Play It Again released \"Born Free \u2013 The Don Black Songbook\", which remains the only album to date which consists solely of songs co-written by the lyricist.\n\nIn 2007, Black was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. That same year, Black was credited on \"Sexy Lady\", the 2007 debut single and hit for rapper Yung Berg, which sampled the Black-Barry theme for \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\n\nOn 17 August 2008, the tribute concert \"Lyrics by Don Black\" was held at the London Palladium, featuring performances of Black's songs by a selection of guest artists. The evening, hosted by Michael Parkinson and recorded for broadcast by BBC Radio 2, included an exclusive performance of two songs from Black's new musical, \"The Count of Monte Cristo\". The concert included contributions from Lee Mead, Gary Barlow, Elkie Brooks, Craig David, Maria Friedman, Joe Longthorne, Lulu, Peter Grant, Raza Jaffrey, Matt Rawle, Ryan Molloy, Marti Webb, Jonathan Ansell, Hayley Westenra, Phil Campbell and Mica Paris. The singers were accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Mike Dixon and with guest conductors Michel Legrand and David Arnold.\n\nIn October 2013, a special concert to celebrate Black's work was held at London's Royal Festival Hall, featuring a lengthy interview with the composer by Michael Grade, interspersed by performances of his songs by artists such as Michael Ball, Maria Friedman, Katie Melua, and Marti Webb. The concert was recorded for television and first shown on BBC Four in early January 2014.\n\nBlack lives in London, England. His wife of nearly 60 years, Shirley, died in March 2018.\n\nBlack's elder brother, Michael Black, a showbusiness booking agent, was married to singer Julie Rogers until his death in November 2018.\n\nRay of Hope (1991)(released 2007, 3 Ships 22nd Anniversary Album) music by Jon Anderson and Mike Marshall\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166227", "title": "Jewish Publication Society of America Version", "text": "The Jewish Publication Society of America Version (JPS) of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) was the first Bible translation published by the Jewish Publication Society of America and the first translation of the Tanakh into English by a committee of Jews (though there had been earlier solo efforts, such as that of Isaac Leeser). The full publication title is \"The Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text: A New Translation with the Aid of Previous Versions and with Constant Consultation of Jewish Authorities\".\n\nThe translation, which appeared in 1917, is heavily indebted to the Revised Version and American Standard Version. It differs from them in many passages where Jewish and Christian interpretations differ, notably in , where it has \"young woman\" as opposed to the word \"virgin\" which is used in most Christian Bibles.\n\nThe translation was initiated in 1892 by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the organization of Reform rabbis, and the original intention was to assign different books of the Bible to individual rabbis and scholars. A committee of editors would ensure quality and consistency. It became clear after several years that this method was hard to implement, and after more than a decade only the Book of Psalms had been sent to press. In 1908 the Jewish Publication Society agreed to take over the project.\n\nThe Jewish Publication Society's plan called for a committee of seven editors who would be responsible for the entire translation. They included Solomon Schechter, Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jacobs, from the Society, and Kaufmann Kohler, David Philipson, and Samuel Schulman, from the Central Conference of American Rabbis. They were led by Editor-in-Chief Max Margolis. The editorial committee comprised an equal number of faculty from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, and Dropsie College for Hebrew in Philadelphia. The work was completed in November 1915 and published two years later.\n\nThe translators state their reason for a new version in their \"Preface,\" in a passage that suggests the emotional as well as rational need they felt for a Bible of their own:\n\nThe repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation show their sentiment toward translations prepared by other denominations. The dominant feature of this sentiment, apart from the thought that the christological interpretations in non-Jewish translations are out of place in a Jewish Bible, is and was that the Jew cannot afford to have his Bible translation prepared for him by others. He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot borrow his soul from others. If a new country and a new language metamorphose him into a new man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a new garb and a new method of expression for what is most sacred and most dear to him.\n\nThe translation is based on the Hebrew Masoretic text. It follows the edition of Seligman Baer except for the books of Exodus to Deuteronomy, which never appeared in Baer's edition. For those books, C. D. Ginsburg's Hebrew text was used.\n\nThe order of the books is Torah (the five books of Moses), Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings). Christian readers would note differences in the order of the books from the Christian Bible, as well as some breaks in where chapters begin and end (such as Deuteronomy 12:32 vs. 13:1), and also in Tehillim (Psalms) where the titles are often counted as the first verse, causing a difference of one in verse numbering for these psalms as they appear in Christian Bibles.\n\nThis translation was superseded by the JPS \"Tanakh\" (NJPS), which appeared in a complete form in 1985. However, the 1917 version is still widely disseminated through its appearance in the commentaries of the Soncino Books of the Bible and the Torah commentary edited by Joseph H. Hertz. Further, it has influenced many subsequent 20th century translations by drawing attention to the Jewish view of many passages.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166236", "title": "Kari Kairamo", "text": "Kari Antero Oswald Kairamo, titled \"Vuorineuvos\" (31 December 1932, in Helsinki in Finland \u2013 11 December 1988, in Espoo, Finland), was a Chairman and CEO of Nokia Corporation and a significant and popular person in the industry, who was also actively involved in Finland's foreign policy.\n\nKari Kairamo had a master's degree in engineering (wood processing). Early on in his career, he had leading positions in several international firms in the paper industry. Nokia hired him in 1967, when it was still a major player in the forest industry. In 1977, Kairamo became CEO of Nokia after Bj\u00f6rn Westerlund retired. Kairamo's mission was to build Nokia fast into an internationally large multi-industry company, and he led several courageous acquisitions for the company.\n\nThe late 1980s was a very special period of time both for the Nokia Corporation and for Finland. The place Finland occupied on the map of Europe was about to change, and cold war and protectionism in the Finnish trade politics was about to break down.

Like Bronko Nagurski before him, Kiniski was one of the first world champions in professional wrestling to have a previous background in football. He is the father of professional wrestler Kelly Kiniski and international amateur and professional wrestler Nick Kiniski.\n\nOne of six children of local politician Julia Kiniski, who emigrated from Poland, Kiniski grew up in Edmonton. At the age of seventeen he was over six feet tall. Kiniski wrestled and played football at St. Joseph's High School. In March 1947, he entered the annual Edmonton School's Boxing and Wrestling Tournament at Westglen gymnasium. Due to his size, he was the lone heavyweight competing.\n\nKiniski captured the attention of Annis Stukus, a scout for the Edmonton Eskimos, of the then Western Interprovincial Football Union in 1949, (which later merged with the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union to form the Canadian Football League). Along with Kiniski, wrestlers Al Oeming and Stu Hart were at the training camp as well. Two of his Eskimos teammates were future wrestlers Wilbur Snyder and Joe Blanchard.\n\nKiniski secured himself a spot on the defensive line and his play earned him a scholarship to the University of Arizona. He was enrolled there from September 18, 1950 to January 26, 1952 and played on the defensive line for Bob Winslow. Rod Fenton recruited Kiniski into professional wrestling in Arizona in 1952.\n\nKiniski returned to Edmonton to play football for the Eskimos, and he suffered a torn kneecap in the team's first game against Saskatchewan in August 1952. He retired from football in 1953 to resume wrestling full-time. \n\nAfter retiring from football, Kiniski trained with Dory Funk and Tony Morelli for a wrestling career, eventually making his pro debut on February 13, 1952 in Tucson, Arizona, where he defeated Curly Hughes. Kiniski's first exposure on television was in Southern California in 1954 alongside other wrestlers such as Wilbur Snyder and Bobo Brazil. One year later, he teamed up with John Tolos to win his first major championship, the International TV Tag Team title, in Los Angeles, then challenged NWA World Champion Lou Thesz in November 1954. As an emerging talent, Kiniski got the opportunity to wrestle Lou Thesz at the Olympic Auditorium on November 3, 1954. Kiniski lost in two straight falls.\n\nFrom there, Kiniski ventured to San Francisco and teamed with Lord James Blears to win the territory's version of the NWA World Tag Team title three times in 1955; after that, he went to Texas and, wrestling as Gene Kelly, captured the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship in 1956.\n\nKiniski began wrestling in his native Canada for the first time in November 1956, debuting for Toronto's Maple Leaf Wrestling. His first main-event match in the territory took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in January 1957, when he teamed with Buddy Rogers against Whipper Billy Watson and Pat O'Connor and saw the beginning of a lengthy feud with Watson that spanned across Canada; the Kiniski-Watson feud gained national exposure due to their matches sometimes being seen on CBC Television. He also challenged NWA World Heavyweight titleholders Watson, Thesz and Dick Hutton for the title on several occasions between 1955 and 1957.\n\nIn 1957, Kiniski competed in Montreal and Toronto. His feuds with Whipper Billy Watson, Yukon Eric, \u00c9douard Carpentier, and Pat O'Connor pushed his career further.\n\nGene captured the British Empire title from O'Connor on May 2, 1957, and the Montreal version of the world title from Carpentier on June 12, 1957. Kiniski headlined a wrestling card at Delormier stadium in Montreal, where he dropped the Montreal world title to Killer Kowalski on July 17, 1957 in front of 21,000 fans. In 1959, Kiniski teamed with Don Leo Jonathan, \"The Mormon Giant\" to win the Canadian Open Tag Team Championship.\n\nKiniski joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1960 and defeated AWA World Champion Verne Gagne to win the title on July 11, 1961, also capturing the AWA World Tag Team title twice with Hard Boiled Haggerty. The title reign lasted less than a month. Kiniski won another title in West Texas a year later.\n\nIn 1962, Kiniski began what became the peak period of his career when he went to Vancouver to join . Early on, he won the NWA British Empire Heavyweight title twice and the Pacific Coast Tag Team title three times, and he challenged again for the NWA World title, taking on Rogers in a main event at Empire Stadium in Vancouver on July 30, 1962 (Rogers beat Kiniski to retain his title), and Thesz in 1963. He made Vancouver his home base while also making appearances in other promotions throughout North America and in Japan, particularly a lengthy stint in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1964; while there, he challenged WWWF Champion Bruno Sammartino several times. Kiniski wrestled Sammartino on November 16, 1964 at Madison Square Garden. Thinking that he had pinned Sammartino in the second fall, Kiniski took the belt and left the ring. Despite being counted out, Kiniski kept the title until a rematch on December 14 settled the matter of who was the real champion.\n\nHe also went to Dick the Bruiser's Indianapolis-based World Wrestling Association in December 1965 and captured its World Heavyweight title, holding it for four months. A few weeks later, Kiniski earned the opportunity to contend for the National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight title.\n\nThe pinnacle of Kiniski's career finally came on January 7, 1966, when he defeated Thesz to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in St. Louis, Missouri in front of 11,612 fans at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis.\n\nCompared to Thesz, Kiniski was a heel and was very comfortable in his role as a \"bad guy\" world champion. As world champion, Kiniski wrestled many well-known luminaries. These included Bobo Brazil, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, Bill Watts, \u00c9douard Carpentier, Pat O'Connor, and the Funks, Terry and Dory, Jr., respectively.\n\nHe travelled worldwide to defend his title during his three-year reign as champion, including making frequent stops back in Vancouver to defend his title in NWA All Star, taking on challengers such as Lou Thesz, Don Leo Jonathan, Dutch Savage, Bill Dromo, Bearcat Wright, John Tolos, Chris Tolos, Abdullah the Butcher, Haystacks Calhoun, Bobby Shane, Dean Higuchi, Tex McKenzie and Paddy Barrett in the promotion.\n\nAfter stops in Honolulu, Tokyo, and becoming the first World Champion to appear in Los Angeles in more than 11 years in November 1968, Kiniski was exhausted. At the 1968 NWA Convention, Kiniski announced that it was time to step down. He agreed to lose the championship to Dory Funk, Jr., and eventually went down to a spinning toehold on February 11, 1969 in Tampa. However, he later claimed in a WWE DVD release that the manner of his loss was accidental, as he submitted early to the toehold believing that the match was a two out of three falls encounter.\n\nThe NWA World title loss was not the end of the line, however, as Kiniski continued winning championships in NWA All Star and elsewhere. He won the NWA Missouri Heavyweight title from Terry Funk in St. Louis on March 16, 1973, while back in Vancouver, he won the Pacific Coast Heavyweight title seven times from 1970 to 1979, and won the Canadian Tag Team title ten times between 1963 and 1976, and in Japan, he captured the NWA International Heavyweight title in 1970. He also got involved in the promotional side of the business when he joined forces with Sandor Kovacs and Portland promoter Don Owen to acquire the Vancouver territory in the late 1960s; that, combined with Kiniski's NWA World title reign at the time, helped make Vancouver a wrestling hotbed for several years, until Kovacs sold his share in the promotion to Al Tomko in 1977. Kiniski retained his ownership stake in NWA All Star until around 1983.\n\nKiniski also wrestled for several months in 1970 and 1971 as a masked wrestler, \"The Crimson Knight\", on local TV (KPLR-TV) matches in St. Louis, Missouri. The storyline continued through numerous attempts to unmask the Knight (his mask was sewn onto his tights, making an easy removal impossible) before he was finally unmasked and revealed to be Kiniski.\n\nKiniski remained involved in the sport for a few more years, teaming periodically with his sons, Kelly and Nick, refereeing the main event of the inaugural NWA Starrcade (Ric Flair vs. NWA World Champion Harley Race in a steel cage) in 1983, and later promoting events for Stampede Wrestling and the AWA in Vancouver while occasionally stepping into the ring. His final matches as an active wrestler took place in Winnipeg's West Four Wrestling Alliance on February 25, 1992, defeating \"Bulldog\" Bob Brown, Bob Ryan and Randy Rudd in singles matches, teaming with Chris Jericho and Lance Storm to battle Brown, The Natural and Gerry Morrow to a no-contest in a six-man match, and being the last man eliminated by Morrow in a battle royal to fill the vacant WFWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship at a WFWA TV taping in Winnipeg. He acted as the cornerman for Dory Funk Jr. in a match between Funk and Nick Bockwinkel (with Verne Gagne) at Slamboree 1993. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, and into the Tragos/Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Newton, Iowa in 2004.

The winner turned out to be Genichiro Tenryu; Kiniski left thereafter, and in 2001 the permanent PWF president was announced as Stan Hansen, who had competed in the tournament and lost to Tenryu in the semifinals.\n\nIn addition to his sports pursuits, Kiniski went into acting on occasion, appearing in the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie \"Paradise Alley\", as well as \"Double Happiness\" (which also starred Sandra Oh) and the made-in-Vancouver cult film \"Terminal City Ricochet\" (with former \"Big Valley\" regular Peter Breck), playing a bit role as a policeman. On the TV side, he appeared as one of the wrestling legends interviewed on The Comedy Network series \"Wrestling with the Past\", and he served as a commercial pitchman in several TV ads aired in the Vancouver area. He also made an appearance on an episode of the CBUT arts and entertainment magazine show \"Zero Avenue\" in 1993, discussing art with host/interviewer Christine Lippa in a Vancouver-area art gallery.\n\nOn April 4, 2010, Jim Ross reported on his blog that Kiniski had \"taken a turn for the worse and is battling to stay alive. 'Big Thunder's' cancer has spread to his brain and some speculate that is just a matter of time [before he dies]\". Kiniski died on April 14, 2010, aged 81, at his home in Blaine, Washington. A celebration of his life was held on April 25, 2010 at Kiniski's Reef in Point Roberts, USA, where Gene often appeared at his son's Nick's tavern.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166248", "title": "Aomori Station", "text": "Aomori Station is served by the following lines:\n\nThe Tsugaru-Kaiky\u014d Line formerly served Aomori Station as a connection to Hakodate in Hokkaido via the Seikan Tunnel.

Plants which differ in this way are known as \"chemotypes\" and a geographical population will generally contain a mix of chemotypes.

These are the Regulation Queen's Colour and Regulation Regimental Colour. These are often referred to as the standard or ensign.\n\nColours are the identifying battle flags carried by military regiments to show where their respective troops should rally in battle. Originally these were 6'6\" x 6' in size, though have now been reduced to 3'9\" x 3', as regiments no longer carry their colours on the battlefield.\n\nPrior to 1743, each infantry regiment of the British Army was responsible for the design and quantity of standards carried, often with each company having its own design. In that year King George II issued a royal warrant to require each regiment to have, as their first colour, the King's colour. It was also to consist of the Union Jack throughout, as a symbol of royal allegiance. The second colour was to be the colour of the facings (uniform linings) of each Regiment, with the Union flag in the upper canton. When Regiments had red or white facings, this was to be replaced by the red cross of St George on a white background. Regiments with \"Royal\" designation or named after the members of the royal family, regardless of facings, used blue regimental colours (plus the optional Union Jack canton), Irish regiments green facings.\n\nA second royal warrant was issued in 1747, requiring the Regimental number to be displayed on the colours. As many regiments at that time were known by the name of the Regimental Colonel instead of a number, this requirement was often ignored. On 1 July 1751 a third royal warrant was issued stating \"\"No Colonel is to put his Arms, Crest, Device, or Livery on any part of the Appointments of the Regiment under his Command.\"\" Company colours were phased out altogether, with the battalion colours of the regiment using the designs issued being the only sanctioned ones used.\n\nOver time, these colours have evolved to include the battle honours s awarded to each Regiment, though these have also been limited.\nOnly one British Regiment carries more than two colours on parade. This is the Yorkshire Regiment, who carry four colours. The second pair consists of a stand of honorary battle flags, which are the original size of 6'6\" x 6'. These honorary colours, 'Queen's Honorary Colour' and 'Regimental Honorary Colour,' were originally awarded to the 76th Regiment of Foot, which later became the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment) in 1808, by the Honorable East India Company for their distinguished services during the Battle of Ally Ghur and again at Delhi between 1802 and 1804. In 1948 the 1st and 2nd Battalions merged and retained the Honorary Colours. In 2006 the Duke of Wellington's Regiment merged with the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards to form the 'Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)'.\n\nLight infantry regiments (today The Rifles) plus the Brigade of Gurkhas do not use colours at all owing to their role (the latter, however, carries the Queen's Truncheon awarded in 1857 instead).\n\nUnlike the rest of the Army, all five Foot Guards infantry regiments sport a different variant pattern.\n\nGiven the status of the guards regiments as units under royal patronage and for the defence of the British Royal Family and facilities belonging to them, the design of the colours are:\n\n\nUnlike most infantry regiments all five carry all battle honours on both colours.\n\nUntil the 1820s, the Guards infantry carried company colours alongside the regimental battalion colours.\n\nA 3rd colour, the Guards State Colour, is only used when the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are present. Only the Grenadier, Coldstream and Scots Guards use them.

Established in May 1987, it operated predominantly in Queensland. The airline went into voluntary liquidation on 19 June 2001 before being sold to Queensland Aviation Holdings, the parent company of Alliance Airlines in April 2002.\n\nFlight West Airlines was established by Sir Dennis Buchanan in 1987 to operate subsidised passenger services to remote communities on Queensland Government contracts.\n\nInitially the airline used Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft on these services from a base in Brisbane and then quickly expanded, adding DHC-6 Twin Otters and an EMB 110 to the fleet. A second base was established in Cairns. It was soon operating the most extensive network of routes throughout regional Queensland.\n\nFrom bases in Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns it served major cities and small regional communities throughout the state including communities on Cape York Peninsula and in the Torres Strait, major coastal cities and islands, and cities and towns in western Queensland.\n\nThe airline was affiliated with (but independent of) Ansett Australia airlines which ceased operations on 14 September 2001.\nBefore entering liquidation in June 2001, Flight West serviced 34 destinations and employed over 420 staff.\nIn the mid 1990s, the fleet was composed of Beechcraft King Airs, DHC-6 Twin Otters, de Havilland Canada Dash 8s, Embraer EMB 110s and EMB 120s. By the late 1990s the airline had disposed of the Twin Otters and EMB 110s. It acquired Jetstream J32s and jet aircraft in the form of three ex-Ansett Fokker F28s followed shortly after by two newer Fokker 100s.\n\nAt the suspension of services, Flight West operated a mixed fleet of 16 jet and turboprop aircraft:\nFlight West operated 34 routes at the time its services were suspended.\n\nOver the airline's 14-year history, it travelled to destinations in Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island including:\nBamaga, Barcaldine, Bedourie, Birdsville, Blackwater, Boulia, Brisbane, Bundaberg, Cairns, Charleville, Coen, Cooktown, Doomadgee, Edward River, Emerald, Gladstone, Hervey Bay, Hughenden, Julia Creek, Kurumba, Kowanyama, Lockhart River, Longreach, Mackay, Mornington Island, Mount Isa, Normanton, Norfolk Island, Proserpine, Quilpie, Richmond, Rockhampton, Roma, Sydney, Thursday Island (Horn Island), Townsville, Weipa, Windorah and Winton.\n\nThe Fokker jets were used on services linking Norfolk Island with Brisbane and Sydney and between Brisbane, Townsville, Gladstone, Longreach and Emerald.\n\nIn Brisbane, the airline operated from the Ansett Domestic terminal. In Cairns, the airline operated from its own terminal on the western side of the airport adjacent to the Captain Cook Highway for a short time before transferring its operations to the Ansett Terminal in the main terminal complex on the eastern side of the airport.\n\nThe Flight West base in Cairns was later sold to Transtate airlines.\n\nOn 16 June 2001, the airline was placed into voluntary liquidation and PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed to manage the company. Ansett announced on 27 June that they would lease eight of the company's aircraft and restart 16 routes effective immediately. On 14 September 2001, Ansett itself collapsed, again halting Flight West services. After extensive restructuring, the airline was offered for sale on 29 September 2001. In an effort to revitalise the airline, the Australian Government announced on 6 November that they would underwrite the airline's operating costs for three months. The airline began flights between Gladstone and Brisbane on 17 November 2001.\n\nOn 16 April 2002, it was announced that Queensland Aviation Holdings had purchased Flight West Airlines and intended to restructure the company under a new name, Alliance Airlines. Most of the assets of Flight West including the Fokker jets were purchased and the Embraer EMB 120s were sold.

She was a familiar figure on the University of Pennsylvania campus, often dancing on the College Green brandishing homemade flags painted with various political messages and vocally advocating nonviolent social revolution. On October 22, 1996, she committed suicide by self-immolation on the spot where she had often performed in an effort to engage Penn students in the progressive causes she championed; the packages of writings she delivered to six Penn students, two local residents, as well as Penn's campus newspaper and other news organizations contextualized her carefully planned suicide as both protest and a vehicle for her message.\n\nShe changed her performance name to Kathy Change to indicate her commitment to political and social change. She was the daughter of Chinese academics who emigrated to America in the wake of the Chinese Revolution. Change was married to writer Frank Chin for five years.\n\nChange was born Kathleen Chang in Ohio in 1950. Her father, Sheldon Chang, was an engineer and a professor at the State University at Stony Brook, Long Island, New York. Her mother Gertrude (n\u00e9e Hung) was a writer. Her mother's father, William Hung, was one of the founders of Yenching University and later taught at Harvard. She had one brother. Her parents divorced while she was a teenager, leading to Chang's first suicide attempt. Her mother committed suicide when Kathy was 14 years old.\n\nChange graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in New York City and briefly attended Mills College and the Bronx campus of New York University. After she married Frank Chin in 1971, she returned to California. Her marriage lasted five years, and she attempted suicide again after it ended.\nIn 1977, she wrote and illustrated a 24-page children's book, \"The Iron Moonhunter\". The book purportedly retells a legend handed down by Chinese workers of the Central Pacific Railroad working on the First Transcontinental Railroad in the 19th century; the titular train was built using salvaged steel to rescue the restless spirits of workers who had died during construction in harsh mountain conditions.\n\nIn 1981, Change moved to Philadelphia. Around this time, her life became increasingly defined by her political activism and by what many observers would term mental illness. \"The New York Times\" noted that she had seen psychiatrists off and on for her adult life, although friends were unaware if a specific illness had been diagnosed. For a brief period in the early 1980s, she squatted in an abandoned Philadelphia building with others in the Powelton Village neighborhood on the edge of Drexel University campus. She also for awhile lived nearby on Spring Garden Street.\nAround this time, she added an \"e\" to her last name, and informally changed her name to Kathy Change. By 1996, she had legally adopted the name Change.\n\nChange was drawn to political activism for diverse causes for most of her adult life. In 1990, she was named \"Freedom Fighter of the Month\" by \"High Times\" magazine, recognizing her activism for cannabis legalization. For 15 years she gave colorful one-woman street performances on Penn's campus and around Philadelphia to protest the government, during which she danced, sang, played the guitar and electronic keyboard, waved handmade flags, and made speeches. These performances included a weekly presentation on Sunday afternoons at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In the final years of her Art Museum performances, she was joined by singer/songwriter David Downing, who wrote \"Stop the Business (Transformation Day),\" an anthem for her political movement.\n\nChange founded and led the Transformation Party, a political party that advocated a complete change of the government and society. An \"emergency economy\" would be created by workers in essential industries, which would allow the majority of citizens to form a more representative democracy.\n\nAt 11:20 am, October 22, Change doused herself with gasoline in front of \"Peace Symbol\", a stainless steel sculpture (Robert Engman, 1967; installed 1983) west of the Van Pelt Library and set herself on fire. Flames shot ten feet in the air as she danced in front of approximately fifty onlookers. Penn Police officer Bill Dailey tried to put out the flames with his jacket and was subsequently honored at a 1997 ceremony held by the school's Division of Public Safety, for attempting to prevent Change's suicide. A speech given at the event cited Dailey's \"heroism under emotionally stressful and physically dangerous circumstances\". After he noticed the flames from a distance and determined that a person was on fire, he attempted to extinguish the conflagration by wrapping her in his patrol jacket and rolling her on the ground. The flames restarted several times.\n\nShe was taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with burns over 100% of her body. Change was pronounced dead at 11:48 am.\n\nIn a packet of her writings that she delivered to \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", the \"Daily Pennsylvanian\", and several friends and acquaintances (six students and two local citizens) on the morning of her death, she explained the rationale behind her suicide:\n\nChange felt that she \"need[ed] to do something sensational that will make headline news and people will have to stop and talk about me and the message that I'm trying to put out.\"\n\nA memorial is held in her honor every year on October 22 at the peace sign sculpture on the University of Pennsylvania campus where Kathy died. The memorial attracts artists, activists and performers, among others.\n\nPercussionist/composer Kevin Norton wrote a suite for Kathy Change entitled \"Change Dance (Troubled Energy)\" in 2001 and was released late in 2001/early 2002 on the Barking Hoop label.\n\nDrummer Tyshawn Sorey composed and performed \"For Kathy Change,\" a quintet in her honor, in March 2011.\n\nSoomi Kim wrote and performed in the biographical play \"Chang(e)\", directed by Suzi Takahashi, which premiered in 2013 and has had multiple performances since then, including New York City and Portland, Oregon.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning playwright Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes's 2016 play \"Daphne's Dive,\" based in Philadelphia, features a character closely resembling Kathy Change.

The French Admiral, the Comte de Grasse, attacked the British islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, with 7000 troops and 50 warships, including the 110 gun \"Ville de Paris\". He started by besieging the British fortress on Brimstone Hill on 11 Jan. 1782. Hood, hoping to salvage the situation, made for St Kitts by departing Antigua on 22 Jan. with 22 ships of the line compared to De Grasse's 36.\n\nThe British fleet on 24 January consisted of twenty-two sail of the line, and was close off the south-east end of Nevis. They ran into and captured the French 16-gun cutter \"Espion\" which carried a large amount of ammunition for the besieging French forces at Brimstone Hill.\n\nAt daybreak on 25 January, the French fleet was discovered having stood to the southward of Basseterre, consisting of one 110 gun ship, twenty-eight two-decked ships, and two frigates. Hood stood towards the French fleet with the apparent intention of bringing on action, and effectively drew the French fleet off the land. No sooner had Hood effected this maneuver he was aided by a favourable change in wind and was able to guide his fleet within the anchorage of Basseterre, which the French admiral had just quit. Hood ordered his fleet in an L formation and then ordered his fleet to lay anchor. Comte de Grasse made three distinct attacks upon the British fleet on 26 January but was repulsed.\n\nThe \"Pluton\", commanded by D'Albert de Rions, lead the French line, \"receiving the crashing broadside of ship after ship until the splintered planking flew from her off side and her rigging hung in a tangled mass.\" Chauvent goes on to describe the battle as \"...a sulphurous hell, with cannon vomiting forth flame and death.\" The entire battle lasted from 7 AM to 6:30 PM, with the major action in the afternoon.\n\nDamages on both sides were heavy, though the French suffered higher casualties. However, Hood was unable to stop the French and could only observe the land action. After the successful French siege of Brimstone Hill fortress, St. Kitts and Nevis surrendered on 12 February.\n\nHood left on the 14th and joined forces with the recently arrived Admiral George Rodney.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n"}, {"id": "2166303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166303", "title": "Cap Gris-Nez", "text": "Cap Gris-Nez (literally \"cape grey nose\") is a cape on the C\u00f4te d'Opale in the Pas-de-Calais \"d\u00e9partement\" in northern France.\n\nIt is between Wissant and Audresselles, in the commune of Audinghen.\n\nThe cliffs of the cape are the closest point of France to England \u2013 from their English counterparts at Dover.

It is derived from colloquial Dutch \"grey cape\"; officially, the Dutch name was \"Swartenesse\" (\"black cape\") to set it apart from \"Blankenesse\" \"white cape\" (Cap Blanc-Nez) to the northeast. The element \"-nesse\" is cognate to English \"-ness\", denoting \"headland\", as in for example Dungeness or Sheerness.\n\nThe cliffs of Cap Gris-Nez are made of sandstone, clay and chalk. They are mainly grey, which gives the cape its name. It is also a good place to collect fossils, which are mainly from the Jurassic period. One can find bivalves, gastropods and wood. In the sandstone layers with small pebbles, one can find teeth of fish and reptiles. Sometimes, larger ammonites are found in the sandstones.\n\nThe cape is a regular stopover for millions of migratory birds.\n\nThe proximity of the cape to England led to the frequent destruction of the nearby village of Audinghen in wars between England and France. On the top of the cliff are the ruins of an English fortress, built by Henry VIII at the beginning of the 16th century. The English called the fort 'Blackness', a translation of the Dutch name \"Swartenisse\". \n\nNapoleon stopped at the cape on 1 July 1803 whilst making an inspection of the coast around Boulogne-sur-Mer and of his invasion troops. He then envisioned setting up a cross-Channel optical telegraph, with a semaphore on the cape. The first semaphore of this line was installed on the cape in 1805, without waiting for the planned French invasion of England. On 18 July 1805, a memorable naval battle took place off the cape. A British flotilla with strong numerical superiority pursued Dutch ships that were following the coast and trying to get back into harbor of Ambleteuse. Expecting an attack of this type, Napoleon had stationed a battery of 300 guns on the cape, and a barrage from this force obliged the British vessels to withdraw.\n\nCommandant Ducuing and his men died on May 25, 1940 while defending the semaphore, and a commemorative stela was later placed on the cape to commemorate this sacrifice.\n\nLater, the Germans built a blockhouse inside the Tudor ruins. The locality has a cluster of World War II bunkers, part of the Atlantic Wall intended to rebuff the anticipated allied invasion. There are heavy artillery sites \u2013 Grosser Kurf\u00fcrst Battery, formerly with three 170 millimeter guns, and Todt Battery, with four 380\u00a0mm guns. These covered the approaches to both Calais and Boulogne and they were protected by massive concrete blockhouses and other lesser defensive sites. One of the Todt Battery blockhouses now houses the Atlantic Wall Museum.\n\nUnits of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division liberated the area in September 1944.\nThe cylindrical concrete lighthouse at Cap Gris-Nez dates from 1958. It is 31 meters (102 feet) high, and replaces an earlier structure destroyed in 1944.\n\nThe lighthouse and its accompanying radar station provide guidance to over 500 ships passing the cape every day.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166304", "title": "Battle of Groix", "text": "The Battle of Groix was a large naval engagement which took place near the island of Groix off the Biscay coast of Brittany on 23 June 1795 (5 messidor an III) during the French Revolutionary Wars. The battle was fought between elements of the British Channel Fleet and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral Lord Bridport, was covering an invasion convoy carrying a French Royalist army to invade Quiberon, while the French under Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as Cornwallis's Retreat, and were attempting to return to their base at Brest when Bridport's force of 14 ships of the line appeared on 22 June.\n\nVillaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to Lorient.\n\nAlthough the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.\n\nThe first two years of the French Revolutionary Wars had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the Breton harbour of Brest, suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the French Revolution was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by a purge of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders. In May 1794, the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the United States and was attacked by the British Channel Fleet at the battle of the Glorious First of June, losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794\u20131795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the \"Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver\". By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant blockade of the French fleet in Brest.\n\nIn May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse sent a squadron of three ships of the line and several frigates under Contre-amiral Jean Gaspard Vence to Bordeaux with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest. On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of Belle \u00cele on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis. Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle \u00cele, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle \u00cele anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of Lorient.\n\nOn the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard. Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship HMS \"Mars\", until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect \"Mars\", Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship HMS \"Royal Sovereign\" between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back. At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate HMS \"Phaeton\" to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as Cornwallis's Retreat.\n\nUnbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from Spithead on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, which carried a French Royalist army to Quiberon with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany. This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the Ushant headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle \u00cele on 19 June. Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, they were still at sea \u2013 Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele.\n\nIt was one of Warren's ships, the frigate HMS \"Arethusa\", which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on \"Arethusa\" miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French. Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having taken aboard only enough for 15 days in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier. On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.\n\nThe adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates HMS \"Nymphe\" and HMS \"Astrea\" finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast, the British approximately from the French coast. On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle. To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his \"best-sailing\" ships HMS \"Sans Pareil\", HMS \"Orion\", HMS \"Colossus\", HMS \"Irresistible\", HMS \"Valiant\" and HMS \"Russell\", to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30. Bridport followed in his 100-gun first rate flagship HMS \"Royal George\", accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship HMS \"Queen Charlotte\" and seven 98-gun second rate ships.\n\nAll day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather. To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever tack they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions. At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, \"Alexandre\" under Captain Fran\u00e7ois Charles Guillemet far to the rear and only from the British vanguard. \"Alexandre\" had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a sharp engagement with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged. The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a line of battle rapidly enough.\n\nAgainst expectation, Bridport's leading ship was \"Queen Charlotte\", which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain Richard Grindall in \"Irresistible\", with \"Orion\", \"Colossus\", \"Sans Pareil\" and \"Russell\" a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear. At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately to the east of \"Queen Charlotte\", the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.\n\nWith \"Alexandre\" now in danger of becoming isolated, Villaret sent the frigate \"R\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e\" to take the lumbering vessel under tow at 05:00. Just under an hour later, Douglas brought \"Queen Charlotte\" within range, Guillemet firing his stern-chasers at his three-decked opponent. Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain Sir James Saumarez in \"Orion\", which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with \"Formidable\" under Captain Charles Linois a little way ahead of \"Alexandre\" and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship \"Peuple\" ahead of \"Formidable\". With the French admiral were \"Redoutable\", \"Mucius\", \"Wattignies\", \"Tigre\" and Vence's flagship \"Nestor\", while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced. Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.\n\nAt 06:15, \"Queen Charlotte\" passed \"Alexandre\" and began firing on \"Formidable\", Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the poop deck. As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, \"Sans Pareil\", flagship of Rear-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing \"Formidable\" to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from \"Queen Charlotte\" had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717. As \"Sans Pareil\" passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on \"Formidable\" collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, struck his colours and surrendered. As \"Sans Pareil\" and \"Queen Charlotte\" battled \"Formidable\", \"Colossus\" and \"Russell\", joined by the second rates HMS \"London\" and HMS \"Queen\", pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.\n\nAt 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds. The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in \"Queen Charlotte\" had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of \"Alexandre\"; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect. Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on \"Peuple\" and \"Tigre\", joined by \"Sans Pareil\" which attacked \"Tigre\" under Captain Jacques Bedout and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of \"Tigre\", and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; \"they would have passed over my very body had not taken command and prevented a collision\", he wrote in his report. As \"Tigre\" fell out of line, \"Queen\" and \"London\" joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds. The French ship had been severely damaged, with of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.\n\nAt 07:57, Bridport's \"Royal George\" reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of \"Queen Charlotte\" having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled \"Colossus\" under Captain John Monkton, the leading British ship more than ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in \"Sans Pareil\" who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating \"Peuple\", on which Villaret's flag captain Jacques Angot had been killed in action. Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged \"Peuple\" approximately west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at \"Tigre\", which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby \"Peuple\" and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the River La\u00efta, Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.\n\nBridport gave instructions as he withdrew for \"Alexandre\", \"Formidable\" and \"Tigre\" to be taken under tow by HMS \"Prince\", HMS \"Barfleur\" and HMS \"Prince George\" respectively. The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only \"Queen Charlotte\" had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; \"Queen Charlotte\" and \"Colossus\" had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively. Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at Carnac on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren. Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Spencer, but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.\n\nVillaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate \"Prosperine\" to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals Kerguelen and \u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the weather gage to bombard the French at will and attack them with fireships. Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to Rochefort. French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded. In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating \"\"Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgr\u00e9 nos signaux r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s, des ordres transmis par porte-voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme \u00e0 lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire\"\" (\"Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship\"). Several French captains were court-martialled: Jean Magnac of \"Z\u00e9l\u00e9\", already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labri\u00e8re of \"Fougueux\". Captain Larr\u00e9guy of \"Mucius\" was censured for not adequately supporting \"Tigre\", and three other captains were tried but acquitted.\n\nIn common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year, rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of \"Queen\". This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of \"London\", whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's. Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and \"Queen Charlotte\" were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.\n\nAll three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of \"Alexandre\" reverted to the former \"Alexander\", and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by \"Alexander\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s presence in the line at the Battle of the Nile in 1798 under Captain Alexander Ball. \"Tigre\" retained her French name, while \"Formidable\", as there was already a ship by that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS \"Belleisle\", apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle \u00cele in the aftermath of the battle. \"Belleisle\" had a long and successful career, fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood.\n\nMore controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient]. His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, \"\"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\"\" (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while William Laird Clowes wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a Nelson, a Hawke or even a Boscawen commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\" Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and Richard Woodman have compared Groix with the battles of Genoa and Hy\u00e8res fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, William Hotham, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166306", "title": "Laminariaceae", "text": "Laminariaceae is a family of brown algal seaweeds, many genera of which are popularly called \"kelp\".

Judges in several civil and criminal cases ruled in favor of the federal government and against Schiff. As a result of these judicial rulings Schiff was in a hospital prison serving a sentence of 162 months (13.5 years) at the time of his death at the age of 87. The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that Schiff died on October 16, 2015.\n\nSchiff is the father of businessman and former United States Senate candidate Peter Schiff.\n\nSchiff was born to a Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut. His parents were immigrants from Poland and his father worked as a carpenter. In 1950, Schiff attended the University of Connecticut where he obtained a B.S. with a double major in Accounting and Economics.\n\nAfter college, Schiff was in the insurance brokerage business in Connecticut. In connection with his business, he was involved in a tax shelter in which he became the victim of a Ponzi scheme in which he lost money belonging to him and his clients. In 1968, he testified before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency in opposition to the removal of gold backing from Federal Reserve Notes. In 1976, he published a book entitled \"The Biggest Con: How the Government is Fleecing You\".\n\nSchiff was a candidate for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination in 1996, and he participated in a Libertarian presidential candidates debate in Washington on July 5, 1996.\n\nSchiff had a web site named \"PayNoIncomeTax.com,\" which offered his various books for sale. He was featured in Hollywood producer Aaron Russo's 2006 film \".\"\n\nAmong the arguments raised over the years by Schiff:\nThese arguments were ruled invalid in \"Schiff v. Commissioner\". Another argument made by Schiff on his web site is: \"On the 1040 itself... you report 'zero' income regardless of how much you received in: wages, commissions, interest, alimony, capital gains or from operating a business. For tax purposes, 'income' only means corporate 'profit.' Therefore, no individual receives anything that is reportable as 'income'.\" This argument has been rejected by the lower courts, as well as the United States courts of appeal. See \"Cameron v. Internal Revenue Serv.\"; \"Stoewer v. Commissioner\"; \"Reinhart v. United States\"; \"Fink v. Commissioner\"; \"Flathers v. Commissioner\"; \"Schroeder v. Commissioner\"; \"Sherwood v. Commissioner\"; and \"Ho v. Commissioner\".\n\nAccording to his son, Peter Schiff, \"my father was most known for his staunch opposition to the federal income tax, for which the US government labeled him a 'tax protester.' But he had no objection to lawful, reasonable taxation.\"\n\nSchiff had filed income tax returns through the tax year 1973. For years 1974 and 1975, however, he refused to disclose his income. Instead, he sent unsigned 1040 forms to the Internal Revenue Service with the title (\"U.S. Individual Income Tax Return\") changed to read \"U.S. Individual Income Confession.\" Instead of disclosing income, he included assertions of various constitutional rights on the forms, claiming essentially that under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Amendments he would not be an \"involuntary serf\" of the U.S. government. Schiff contended that because Federal Reserve notes were not backed by gold, they were not \"income\" for purposes of the Federal income tax.\n\nSchiff began conducting seminars on Federal income taxes in 1977. On April 12, 1978, Schiff appeared on the NBC television program \"The Tomorrow Show\" with host Tom Snyder, arguing his views on Federal income taxes. Six days after his appearance on \"The Tomorrow Show\", Schiff was charged with willful failure to file tax returns for the years 1974 and 1975. The modified, unsigned 1974 and 1975 forms, with no income information on them, were deemed by the Internal Revenue Service not to be valid Federal income tax returns under . During the resulting trial, a videotape of the television program was shown to the jury. Schiff was convicted on both counts and appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nAt the Court of Appeals, the admission of the videotape was ruled unduly prejudicial, the conviction was overturned, and the case was remanded for a new trial. He was convicted a second time for failure to file, and that conviction was affirmed.\n\nIn October 1985, Schiff was convicted of tax evasion with respect to his personal income taxes for years 1980, 1981, and 1982, and willful failure to file a corporate tax return for Irwin A. Schiff, Inc. (a company for which he served as president), and that conviction was affirmed the following year. Schiff was released from the Federal prison system in June 1993. Despite having spent four years in the system, he continued his tax protest related activities.\n\nIn June 2004, a Federal court ruled that Schiff was liable for over $2 million in taxes, penalties and interest for the years 1979 through 1985. In that case, Schiff's attorney had filed a brief claiming a diminished capacity defense, contending that Schiff had been diagnosed with a chronic, severe delusional disorder relating to his beliefs about the federal income tax system. That was characterized by some of his opponents as a claim that those beliefs were the product of a delusion or even insanity and that Schiff had willingly allowed his defense counsel to raise such an argument.\n\nSchiff responded to these claims and stated that the diminished capacity defense was an attempt to prevent the judge from rendering a summary judgment and instead allow a jury trial. Schiff also asserted that this was different from an insanity defense. Schiff, in his statement on the matter, asserted that the judge erred in not putting this question to the jury and insisted that \"(1) no one is required to pay income taxes; (2) the entire federal judiciary is involved in a monumental, criminal conspiracy to collect income taxes in violation of law.\" , Schiff's internet web site still included a claim that the U.S. federal income tax had been repealed in the 1950s and that U.S. officials were engaged in a conspiracy: \"Since the income tax was repealed in 1954 when Congress adopted the 1954 Code, it is clear that for 50 years federal judges in conspiracy with U. S. Department of Injustice prosecutors have been illegally and criminally prosecuting people for crimes that do not exist in connection with a tax that nobody owes.\"\n\n\"The Federal Mafia\" is a book written by Schiff, while in prison. His son Peter Schiff referred to him as a political prisoner. In the book, Schiff contended that the income tax system and Internal Revenue Service were illegal. On August 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the book to be fraudulent and upheld an injunction issued by a U.S. District Court in Nevada under against Irwin Schiff and associates Cynthia Neun and Lawrence Cohen against the sale of this book by those persons. The prohibition does not extend to other sellers of the book.\n\nThe court rejected Schiff's contention on appeal that the First Amendment protects sales of the book, as the court found that the information it contains is fraudulent, as it advertised that it would teach buyers how to legally cease paying federal income taxes.\n\nSchiff, Neun, and Cohen were barred under the injunction from selling or advertising material advocating nonpayment of tax, from preparing a tax return for others, and from otherwise providing assistance or encouragement to others in violating tax law. Schiff and his associates were additionally required to provide a copy of the injunction to each of their customers, post it on their website, and provide the government with a customer list.\n\nSchiff and his associates responded by providing the book for free on their website.\n\nIn 2003, the Internal Revenue Service had identified about 5,000 tax returns filed by about 3,100 of Schiff's customers in a three-year period, reportedly representing about $56 million in attempted tax evasion.\n\nOn October 24, 2005, Schiff was convicted in the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada, on multiple counts of filing false tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002, aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns filed by other taxpayers, conspiring to defraud the United States, and (for his own income taxes for tax years 1979 through 1985) tax evasion, and he again began serving jail time.\n\nDespite Schiff's age (he turned 78 years old on the day of sentencing), on February 24, 2006, Schiff was sentenced to 151 months (12 years and 7 months) in prison and was ordered to pay over $4.2 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service; Schiff was also sentenced to 12 additional months for contempt of court. On December 26, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed Schiff's convictions except for the criminal contempt convictions. The Court vacated the contempt convictions because of the failure of the trial court judge to file contempt orders under rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nThe Court of Appeals indicated that the trial judge could file the appropriate paperwork and re-sentence Schiff on the contempt convictions. On September 5, 2008, the trial judge re-sentenced Schiff to 11 months in prison in connection with the contempt of court, effectively lowering Schiff's overall original sentence by another month.\n\nOne of Schiff's co-defendants, Lawrence Cohen, was sentenced on February 3, 2006 to 33 months in prison and was ordered to pay $480,000 in restitution. On December 26, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed Cohen's conviction because of the failure of the trial court to allow testimony from a psychiatrist regarding Cohen's mental state. The Court of Appeals remanded the Cohen case for a possible re-trial. On June 16, 2009, Cohen pleaded guilty to aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax return. However, Cohen died on August 6, 2009, and his case was therefore dismissed.\n\nOn February 23, 2006, Cynthia Neun, another co-defendant, was sentenced to 68 months in prison and was ordered to pay over $1.1 million in restitution. Neun's conviction was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. According to the prosecutor's office, Neun sold materials encouraging people not to pay taxes, prepared false tax returns, and represented hundreds of taxpayers in dealings with the IRS where she promoted Schiff's arguments. She was required to submit to three years of supervision following her release, which occurred on December 28, 2010.\n\nIn this last case, Schiff's attorneys again asked that the court consider the claim that Schiff had a mental disorder relating to his beliefs about taxes. According to the prosecutor's office, the evidence at trial showed that Schiff had attempted to evade the payment of over $2 million in taxes from 1979 through 1985 and that he had used offshore bank accounts using multiple tax identification numbers and had attempted to hide assets in connection with his tax protester related activity.\n\nOther individuals who have been convicted of federal tax crimes after following Irwin Schiff include Warren J. Burdett; Christopher and Pamela Harrison; Scott D. Haynes; Kenneth Heath; Joseph Letscher; David Middleton; Robert L. Mosel; James C. Payne; David G. Pflum; and Steven A. Swan.\n\nSchiff's books had combined sales of more than 250,000. Books written by Schiff include the following:\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166312", "title": "Dyke (surname)", "text": "Dyke is a surname.

The album was released in the UK on 15 August 2005 by Parlophone, and in the US on 27 September 2005 by Capitol Records. The title refers to the city in northern France where the album was recorded, as well as the 1978 album \"Road to Ruin\" by punk rock band Ramones.\n\n\"Road to Rouen\" was a difficult album for the band due to personal reasons, including Danny Goffey's tabloid ordeal and the death of Gaz and Rob Coombes' mother. The album reflected a rough period for the band and was oriented towards longer, looser, more orchestral material. The record was highly acclaimed and well received by most fans of the band; it reached a respectable number 9 on the UK Album Charts. Three singles were released from the album: \"St. Petersburg\" in August 2005, which peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 22; \"Low C\" in October 2005, which peaked at number 52; and \"Fin\" in January 2006, which failed to enter the Top 100.\n\nIn 2004, the band opted to move away from Sawmills Studio in Cornwall, where their first three albums had been recorded, and settled at Studio St. Mard, a converted barn in Rouen, Normandy. Supergrass claimed to have been more \"focused\" despite the rural surroundings and rudimentary recording equipment. Aside from their traditional instrumentation, the band used zithers, ukuleles, brass, strings, and a drum machine. The album's first single, \"St. Petersburg\", was recorded in one take and features no overdubs. Drummer Danny Goffey said of the album's more acoustic, streamlined recording: \"It was a kind of conscious decision to make an album that didn't have a three-minute single, something that had more of a mellow vibe about it. There have been those obscure tracks that have been on the albums that no one probably had heard, because people just buy our singles or see just what's on the charts or on the radio. So yeah, we wanted to make sure that that side of us come out of us a bit more, you know, and that we didn't just pick some radio friendly song to release.\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview, bassist Mick Quinn said the introspection and orchestration of the album was \"almost entirely\" a direct reaction to the death of the Coombes brothers' mother, as well as Danny Goffey's tabloid ordeal. \"Some of it was a reaction to other bad stuff that was going on,\" said Quinn. \"I don't think \"anyone\" was in the mood to release another set of \"Alright\"-style jovial pop songs. Everyone was in a very stern frame of mind. Danny had a lot of personal stuff going on, thanks to the adult tabloid media. He was really messed up. You have to make the most of a bad situation though, and you try and express yourself through your music. It would have been a lie to try and do 'up' music at that point. The lyrics probably were commercial suicide though \u2013 it didn't sell particularly well... but I'm more proud that it actually exists than if it didn't.\"\n\nThe front cover photo depicts a cattle bridge near Lefaux, France that crosses the A16 autoroute, part of the route between Boulogne and Rouen. It was taken at dusk using a Canon EOS 350D set to a 10-second exposure as a lorry passed under the bridge. (the photography is credited to Mick Quinn and Paul Wilson). The inner photo was taken by Pierre Olivier Margerand (studio engineer) and shows the keyboard and drum set up in the live room of Studio St. Mard. Overall album design was by graphic company Traffic and Mick Quinn.\n\n\"Road to Rouen\" was released to generally favourable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received a score of 73, based on 22 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic awarded the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, and said of the album, \"...there's a mastery of tone, as the group creates a warm, trippy, late-night vibe and then never lets it flag over the course of nine songs.\" Erlewine then hailed the album as \"a terrific little record\" and concluded, \"Supergrass have found new things to do with their sound without getting self-consciously mature or middlebrow.\" John Murphy of \"MusicOMH\" lavished the album with praise, stating that \"Road to Rouen\" \"adds up to the sound of a band developing and maturing nicely, without ever losing sight of what made them so great in the first place.\" By contrast, Jack Smith of the BBC was more critical of the album, concluding that, \"Supergrass have outlasted most of their contemporaries and still have it in them to make a truly amazing masterpiece. Unfortunately \"Road to Rouen\" is not quite it.\"\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166338", "title": "Lanarkite", "text": "Lanarkite is a mineral, a form of lead sulfate with formula Pb(SO)O.

He was a columnist for \"The New York Times\" from 1962 to 1998, and hosted the PBS show \"Masterpiece Theatre\" from 1992 to 2004. The \"Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994\" stated: \"Baker, thanks to his singular gift of treating serious, even tragic events and trends with gentle humor, has become an American institution.\"\n\nBorn in Loudoun County, Virginia, Baker was the son of Benjamin Rex Baker and Lucy Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Robinson). At the age of eleven, as a self-professed \"bump on a log,\" Baker decided to become a writer since he figured \"what writers did couldn't even be classified as work.\" After leaving school, he took a scholarship to Johns Hopkins University in 1942, studying for a year before leaving to join the Navy as a trainee pilot. He left in 1945, continuing his degree in English at Johns Hopkins University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1947.\n\nShortly after leaving college, Baker took a job at \"The Baltimore Sun\" as a night police reporter, working his way up to be sent to London as a correspondent for the paper in 1952, and then White House Correspondent shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter covering the White House, United States Congress, and the United States Department of State for \"The New York Times\" for eight years, Baker wrote the nationally syndicated Observer column for the newspaper from 1962 to 1998; initially oriented toward politics, the column began to encompass other subjects after he relocated to New York City in 1974. During his long career as an essayist, journalist, and biographer, he was a regular contributor to national periodicals such as \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"Sports Illustrated\", \"The Saturday Evening Post\", and \"McCalls\". He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993.\n\nBaker wrote or edited seventeen books. Baker's first Pulitzer Prize was awarded to him for distinguished commentary for his Observer columns (1979) and the second one was for his autobiography, \"Growing Up\" (1982); he is one of only six people to have been awarded a Pulitzer Prize for both Arts & Letters (for his autobiography) and Journalism (for his column). He wrote a sequel to his autobiography in 1989, called \"The Good Times\". His other works include \"An American in Washington\" (1961), \"No Cause for Panic\" (1964), \"Poor Russell's Almanac\" (1972), \"Looking Back: Heroes, Rascals, and Other Icons of the American Imagination\" (2002), and various anthologies of his columns. He edited the anthologies \"The Norton Book of Light Verse\" (1986) and \"Russell Baker's Book of American Humor\" (1993).\n\nBaker wrote the libretto for the 1979 musical play \"Home Again, Home Again,\" starring Ronny Cox, with music by Cy Coleman, lyrics by Barbara Fried, choreography by Onna White, and direction by Gene Saks. After an unsuccessful tryout at the American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, Connecticut, the show closed in Toronto and never made it to Broadway. \"That was a great experience,\" Baker said in a 1994 interview with the Hartford Courant. \"Truly dreadful, but fun. I was sorry [the show] folded because I was having such a good time. But once is enough.\"\n\nIn 1993, Baker replaced Alistair Cooke as the regular host of the PBS television series \"Masterpiece Theatre\". \"That's talking-head stuff,\" he said. \"Television is harder than I thought it was. I can't bear to look at myself. I fancied that I was an exceedingly charming, witty and handsome young man, and here's this fidgeting old fellow whose hair is parted on the wrong side.\"\n\nIn 1995, he narrated the Ric Burns documentary \"The Way West\" for PBS' \"American Experience.\"\n\nIn 1950, Baker married Miriam Nash, who died in 2015. The couple had four children, Allen, Kasia, Michael, and Phyllis.\n\nBaker died at his home in Leesburg, Virginia, on January 21, 2019, after complications following a fall. He was 93.\n\nNeil Postman, in the preface to \"Conscientious Objections,\" described Baker as \"like some fourth century citizen of Rome who is amused and intrigued by the Empire's collapse but who still cares enough to mock the stupidities that are hastening its end.

These include the \"Village Inn\" (a pub and restaurant) and a petrol station\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, Fairlie counted 1,510 residents.\n\nFairlie House near Gatehead, Ayrshire in East Ayrshire was named after the Fairlie family of Fairlie; it previous name had been Little Dreghorn.\n\nKing David I of Scotland appointed Sir Richard de Morville, a Norman, to hold land in Scotland. Thus he became High Constable of Scotland and Lord of Cunninghame, Largs and Lauderdale. This piece of land was later sub-divided among Richard's relatives and friends, and, in the 13th century, the land of Fairlie was held by the de Ros (or Ross) family of Tarbert, the land to the North was held by the Boyle family and to the South by the Sempill family.\n\nIt was one of the sons of the Ross family who built the Castle and adopted the name Fairlie. The family continued to live in the Castle until the 17th century, but by the end of the 19th century the castle was in ruins (the Castle has been sold in 1999 to be converted into a dwelling). It has many similarities to Law Castle, Little Cumbrae Castle, and the tower of Skelmorlie Castle.\n\nThe land to the South of Fairlie Burn, held by the Sempill family, was never held by the Fairlie family and is actually in the Parish of West Kilbride. The Montgomerie family latterly held the estate (Southannan). The original building of Southannan House or Castle was demolished in the 18th century and the present house was built some time later.\n\nTo the North of Fairlie are the Kelburn lands, with a fine castle, where members of the Boyville (Boyle) family have been since the 12th century. A David Boyle was honoured in 1703 by being created Viscount Kelburn and Earl of Glasgow. One of the later Earls, in 1850, had a wall built round the estate to give work to the poor people of the area. The present Earl has greatly improved and developed the estate. It is now a country centre, open to the public, and attracts many visitors from far and wide.\n\nAccording to ancient records it would appear that Fairlie developed as a fishing village, as it had a good, sheltered anchorage that was fully used in the 16th century. Weaving also began to help the prosperity of the village as the demand for Paisley shawls increased. The cottages below Fairlie Castle (Burnfoot) were known as Weaver's Row.\n\nA bit further North was the \"middle row\" (Ferry Row), where the fishermen and ferrymen lived. The remains of the old ferry quay can still be seen. This became known as Knox's Rocks as Knox White, an old Fairlie worthy, hired boats in this area in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nStill further north was \"north row\", an indeterminate group of modest dwellings (the Bay Street area). The families kept pigs and hens, grew fruit and vegetables - the more affluent had a cow - other necessities of life were obtained from peddlers, who traveled the countryside. An occasional visit to Largs (by foot) especially to Hyndman's market or to Colm's (Columba's) Day fair.\n\nA turnpike road was built from Greenock to Stranraer in the 18th century and merchants and master mariners began to move into Fairlie. The channel between Fairlie and Cumbrae (Fairlie Roads) was a popular anchorage for merchant shipping, mainly to avoid the dangers of press-gangs at Greenock and the customs could be easier avoided at Fairlie.\n\nThe old cottages, in time, were improved and some enlarged, new buildings were erected. Some of the originals are Rockhaven (the Ferry Inn), Fairlie Lodge, Beach House, Allanbank, Fairlie Cottage and part of Brookside.\n\nIt was in the late 18th century that John Fyfe came from Kilbirnie to set up business as a cartwright in Fairlie. His son William (1785\u20131865) founded the Fife & Son shipyard in Fairlie in 1803 to which William's grandson William Fife III (1857\u20131944) brought international recognition as a prolific designer and builder of sailing yachts.\n\nThe Royal Navy ASDIC research establishment moved from its base at Portland to Fairlie in November 1940 and took over the Fife & Son shipyard. They also worked on other forms of anti-submarine warfare and in 1941 developed the Fairlie Mortar. This was not very successful but evolved into the very successful Squid. A boom defence depot remained post-war and there was a plan for an anti-submarine boom from Fairlie to Great Cumbrae then continuing to Bute.\n\nIn recent years a succession of industrial and military developments has somewhat changed the character of the village. Hunterston B nuclear power station, Hunterston deep sea shipping terminal and a NATO base have been built along the shoreline.\n\nFairlie Pier, closed in 1971, provided links to Clyde ferry services and the Largs Branch. The other railway station in the village still exists and is served by Ayrshire Coast Line services.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166380", "title": "Flathead galaxias (Australia)", "text": "The flathead galaxias (\"Galaxias rostratus\") is a freshwater fish found in lowland rivers and streams and associated billabongs, backwaters, etc. of the southern Murray-Darling river system in Australia.\n\nFlathead galaxias continue a pattern found in Murray-Darling native fish of speciation into upland and lowland habitats.

In 2002 he retired as Senior Medical Advisor for Barclays Bank.\n\nThe third child of Dr William Stuttaford, MC and his wife, Marjorie (\"n\u00e9e\" Royden), Stuttaford was born in Horning, Norfolk. He was educated at Gresham's School and Brasenose College, Oxford.\n\nMarried to Pamela Ropner on 1 June 1957, the couple had three sons: Andrew, Thomas, and Hugo.\n\nPamela Stuttaford died on 4 July 2013.\n\nStuttaford qualified as a doctor in 1959, working at the Hammersmith Hospital before joining his uncle's general practice in rural east Norfolk. Later he helped set up a general practice in Norwich where he remained until being elected as an MP in 1970. He continued practicing medicine as a consultant for Bupa for most of his time in parliament. After losing his seat, Stuttaford remained with BUPA for quite a few more years, but took on other medical jobs including acting as medical adviser to a number of companies, and specializing in genitourinary medicine at the Royal London and Queen Mary's Hospitals, as well as Moorfields Eye Hospital. He also was a partner in a small private practice.\n\nFrom 1970\u201374 Stuttaford was the Conservative MP for Norwich South. He was a frequent dissenter from the Conservative Government's line in Parliament, including over the introduction of value added tax (VAT) on children's shoes, the ending of free school milk in primary schools, and the introduction of museum charges. He also took a leading role within parliament in the campaign, led by \"The Sunday Times,\" to secure compensation for children born with birth defects arising out of their mothers' use of the drug Thalidomide during pregnancy. Stuttaford lost his Norwich South seat to John Garrett in the first general election of 1974.\n\nIn two subsequent elections he was selected as the Conservative candidate in the Isle of Ely to oppose Clement Freud, who had won the seat for the Liberal Party in a by-election in 1973 after the death of Sir Harry Legge-Bourke. Freud later increased his majority in the first 1974 election. Stuttaford was first selected to oppose Freud for 1974's second general election. In their first contest Freud's majority was sharply reduced. Stuttaford was then selected to challenge Freud again. In the 1979 general election Stuttaford received the highest number of Conservative votes ever recorded in the constituency, but the collapse of the Labour vote (many former Labour voters switched their support to the Liberals) ensured that Freud was again returned, this time with a slightly increased majority.\n\nIn 1981, Stuttaford was recruited by the then editor of \"The Times\", Harold Evans, to be the paper's medical correspondent. Stuttaford had worked with Evans during the latter's campaign to secure compensation for the victims of Thalidomide. Later, Stuttaford became \"The Times\" medical columnist, a role he retained until January 2009. In the years that followed he continued to write the regular monthly column for \"The Oldie\" that he had begun in 1994. He filed his last piece for the magazine just a few days before his death. He was a frequent contributor to \"Healthspan\", an online retailer of vitamin supplements, and occasionally to other national newspapers and journals. He was accused by Dr Ben Goldacre in \"The Guardian\" of using an article in \"The Times\" to promote energy replacement pills that appear to have nothing more than a placebo effect. He was parodied in the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" as 'Dr Thomas Utterfraud'.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166398", "title": "Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists", "text": "The Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists (AWAB) is a group consisting of Baptist individuals, organizations, and congregations that are committed to advocating and encouraging the full inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons in the lives and ministries of Baptist churches.

In this episode, Major Kira finds herself compelled to confront an apparent war criminal, the brutally efficient head of the Gallitep slave-labor camp.\n\nA freighter docks at Deep Space 9 so one of its passengers may receive treatment for a condition called Kalla-Nohra, which was caused by a mining accident at a brutal labor camp called Gallitep, during the Cardassian Occupation of Bajor. As the patient himself is a Cardassian, Major Kira has the man arrested as a war criminal, only to find his name, Aamin Marritza, is not listed for any crimes. Commander Sisko sees no option but to release Marritza, but Kira is adamant - Marritza is a Cardassian who was present at Gallitep, which is reason enough. Sisko decides to investigate further and has the man held in custody. Citing a conflict of interest, Sisko asks Kira to remove herself from the case, but her emotional plea and a promise that she will remain professional convince him to let her continue. When she interrogates Marritza, he says that he was only a file clerk at Gallitep.\n\nA photograph from Gallitep reveals that the man being held is not Aamin Marritza but Gul Darhe'el, the \"Butcher of Gallitep\" who reportedly murdered thousands of Bajorans. When confronted with this information; the prisoner proudly admits to being Darhe'el. Kira is shaken. Darhe'el seems convincing; however, inconsistencies in his story begin to stand out. Gul Dukat asserts that Darhe'el is dead; his funeral was widely attended, and half of the Cardassian population viewed his body in state. Furthermore, Darhe'el was not on Bajor during the Kalla-Nohra outbreak and thus could not possibly have the disease. Dr. Bashir discovers that the prisoner has undergone cosmetic surgery, leading Kira to realize that he is indeed Marritza, but is deliberately impersonating Darhe'el.\n\nKira confronts the prisoner with this information. Marritza eventually breaks down in tears, branding himself a coward for not attempting to stop the atrocities at Gallitep. He begs Kira to prosecute him as Darhe'el, as he intended all along, insisting that Cardassia must be forced to admit its wrongdoings and Bajor must have the satisfaction of successfully prosecuting a Cardassian war criminal. Kira releases Marritza, realizing he is a good man so traumatized and remorseful from his experiences that he would give up his life to make amends. Kira and Odo escort Marritza to a ship departing from the station. On the way out of the Promenade, Marritza is suddenly stabbed and killed by a Bajoran. When Kira demands to know why, the Bajoran echoes her earlier sentiment: being a Cardassian is reason enough. \"No!\", Kira realizes, \"It's not\".\n\nThe episode features significant character development on the part of Kira Nerys. It has been suggested that this may be the first episode in which the Cardassian occupation of Bajor can be seen as alluding to the establishment of Israel and Nazi persecution of Jews. From a pitch titled \"The Higher Law\" resembling an existing dramatization based on the Nuremberg Trials, Peter Fields and Ira Steven Behr reshaped the story with reference to Robert Shaw's \"The Man in the Glass Booth\", which tells of a Jewish man who is accused of being a Nazi war criminal.\n\nThe interrogation scenes between Kira and Marritza, particularly an exchange wherein Marritza shifts the focus to Kira's personal life and reverses the questioning, have been compared to exchanges between Jodie Foster's character and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\n\nThe producers of \"\" attempted to re-create the critical success of \"Duet\" with their first-season episode \"Jetrel\". According to DVD commentary accompanying \"Voyager\"'s second season, \"Jetrel\" was a conscious effort to use a similar delivery to create a metaphor for the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In that episode, the character Neelix is forced to confront the scientist who developed a weapon which eradicated thousands of his people.\n\nDespite being a bottle episode, \"Duet\" was featured in Museum of Television and Radio's 1994 \"Tribute to Excellence\" and became a fan favorite, described by \"Startrek.com\" as \"one of \"DS9\"s \u2014 possibly even one of \"Trek\"s \u2014 finest [hours]\". It was included in several editors' choices for a feature there entitled \"You're Stranded on a Desert Asteroid ... Our Best of the Best Episodes\", described by editor Sandy Stone as \"when I knew \"DS9\" really had something going on\". The episode \"is all substance, completely engrossing in its conveyance, and it also features a tragic ending\" according to \"Jammer's Reviews\", an independent science fiction portal. \"I'm not sure I can write a coherent analysis of this episode,\" Michelle Erica Green of the popular fan site \"The Trek Nation\" began her review in 2004. \"I cried just thinking about it for two days after I saw it, and I still cry when I try to discuss it.\" It has nonetheless been noted by some fans that certain parts of the exposition appear rushed, while the believability of Marritza's death scene has been questioned. This can be attributed to the need to contain the episode, as the episode is \"hardly [a] story worthy of a multi-episode arc\".\n\nCast and crew responded positively to the episode as well. In the \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion\", Armin Shimerman (Quark) observed that the episode works because of \"the writing and the directing and the acting all coalescing perfectly\", which Nana Visitor (Kira) believed was because it had \"such important things to say\". Notable staff to list it among their favorites are Behr, \"\" producer Dave Rossi and \"Companion\" author Terry J. Erdmann.\n\nA 2015 binge-watching guide for \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" by W.I.R.E.D. recommended not skipping this essential episode.\n\nIn 2016, \"Radio Times\" rated the death of the character Marritza as the 26th greatest scene in \"Star Trek\", including scenes from movies and television.

They note this episode for exploring the horrors of future-war, as Kira takes on her own sense of justice when confronted with what may be a Cardassian war criminal.\n\nIn 2017, \"Radio Times\" ranked this episode the 5th best episode of \"Star Trek\", especially for those unfamiliar with the franchise. They note it touches upon themes of \"desperation and forgiveness\", although differentiating between the different science fiction aliens may be necessary.\n\nIn 2018, SyFy recommend this episode for its abbreviated watch guide for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys. They offer blunt praise for the plot and acting, remarking, \"The story sounds simple; the performance is anything but.\" (SyFy) They say actress Visitor's performance as Kira in this episode goes beyond being brilliant.\n\nIn 2019, Comicbook.com ranked \"Duet\" the 4th best episode of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166406", "title": "Tennessee Bassoon Quartet", "text": "The Tennessee Bassoon Quartet, formed in 1985, consists of bassoonists Keith McClelland, James Lotz, James Lassen and Michael Benjamin.

It occurs when the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node falls below the rate of the atrioventricular node. This dysrhythmia also may occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block. It is a protective mechanism for the heart, to compensate for the SA node no longer handling the pacemaking activity, and is one of a series of backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so.\n\nJunctional rhythms (if a bradycardia) can cause decreased cardiac output. Therefore, the person may exhibit signs and symptoms similar to other bradycardia such as lightheadedness, dizziness, low blood pressure, and fainting. This rhythm can usually be tolerated if the rate is above 50 beats per minute.\n\nA junctional escape complex is a normal response that may result from excessive vagal tone on the SA node (e.g. digoxin toxicity), a pathological slowing of the SA discharge, or a complete AV block.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166413", "title": "Rosella", "text": "Rosellas are in a genus that consists of six species and nineteen subspecies. \nThese colourful parrots from Australia are in the genus Platycercus. \n\"Platycercus\" means \"broad-tailed\" or \"flat-tailed\", reflecting a feature common to the rosellas and other members of the broad-tailed parrot tribe. Their diet is mainly seeds and fruit.\n\nThe genus was described by naturalist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825; the name \"Platycercus\" derived from the Ancient Greek \"platukerkos\" meaning \"broad-\" or \"flat-tailed\". The relationships with other parrots have been unclear, with the Australian ringneck (genus \"Barnardius\") cited as a closest relative by some, and the genus \"Psephotus\" by others; the plumage of the western rosella seen as a link to the latter genus.\n\nEarly European settlers encountered the eastern rosella at Rose Hill, New South Wales, now Parramatta, and so they called it the Rosehill parakeet which became \"Rosehiller\", and eventually \"rosella\". Vigors defined the genus \"Platycercus\" in 1825, based on \nthe distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, and designated the crimson rosella \"Platycercus elegans\" (as \"Platycercus pennantii\") as the type species. The description as a flat or broad tail follows Heinrich Kuhl, who separated his psittacine specimens to a group with tails that were \"narrow and cuneated\", that is, a tapering wedged outline.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, three groups of rosella species. They are the blue-cheeked species which includes \"elegans\" and \"caledonicus\", the white-cheeked species, \"eximius\", \"adscitus\" and \"venustus\" and the yellow-cheeked species, \"icterotis\". The observed difference in plumage has been reinforced by molecular studies in 1987 and 2015 that place the \"icterotis\" as a basal offshoot.\n\nThere are six species and many subspecies: Ovenden and colleagues analysed mitochondrial DNA, confirming the blue-cheeked and white-cheeked lineages. They found \"P. caledonicus\" to be basal to the other blue-cheeked forms, with \"P. elegans nigrescens\" being divergent from other subspecies of \"P. elegans\". Also, \"P. venustus\" was basal to \"P. eximius\" and \"P. adscitus\". However, a mitochondrial study published in 2017 found that \"P. eximius\" was the earlier offshoot of the lineage that split into \"P. adscitus\" and \"P. venustus\", and that nonsister taxa were hence able to hybridise. In 2015, Ashlee Shipham and colleagues published a molecular study based on nuclear DNA finding that \"P. venustus\" and \"P. adscitus\" were sister species, and that \"P. elegans nigrescens\" diverged earlier than \"P. caledonicus\".\n\n\"Platycercus\", \n\n\nRanging in size from , rosellas are medium-sized parrots with long tails. The feathers on their backs show an obvious scalloping appearance with colouring that differs between the species. All species have distinctive cheek patches. Sexual dimorphism is absent or slight \u2013 males and females generally have similar plumage, apart from the western rosella. The juveniles of the blue-cheeked species, and western rosella, all have a distinctive green-based plumage, while immature plumage of the white-cheeked species is merely a duller version of the adults.\n\nRosellas are native to Australia and nearby islands, where they inhabit forests, woodlands, farmlands, and suburban parks and gardens. They are confined to the coastal mountains and plains and are absent from the outback. Introduced populations have also established themselves in New Zealand (notably in the North Island and in north Dunedin) and on Norfolk Island.\n\nRosellas feed predominantly on seeds and fruit, with food held in the foot. They enjoy bathing in puddles of water in the wild and in captivity. Rosellas scratch their heads with the foot behind the wing.\n\nMutual preening is not exhibited by the genus, and the courtship display is simple; the male waves his tail sideways, and engages in some head bobbing, and the female reciprocates.\n\nLike most parrots, they are cavity nesters, generally nesting high in older large trees in forested areas. They generally have a clutch size of several eggs which are incubated for around 21 days by the female alone. The male feeds the female through this time and for some time after incubation concludes. Quickly covered in a white down, chicks take around five weeks to fledge.\n\nThe more colourful rosella species are popular as pet parrots and also as aviary birds. They can live for longer than 20 years, and they are relatively easy to breed. Some have a reputation for being aggressive in captivity, and are hence recommended be kept separate from other caged birds, while some breeders don't have that experience and quote them as very kind gentle birds. Their diet in aviculture includes seeds, fruit such as apple, pear, and grapes, and vegetable matter such as lettuce, grass, and silver beet.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166422", "title": "Anna Paulownapolder", "text": "The Anna Paulownapolder () is a polder in the municipality of Hollands Kroon in the province of North Holland in the Netherlands.

A single-shot black-powder rifle, the \"kammerlader\" was operated with a crank mounted on the side of the receiver. This made it much quicker and easier to load than the weapons previously used. \"Kammerladers\" quickly gained a reputation for being fast and accurate rifles, and would have been a deadly weapon against massed ranks of infantry.\n\nThe \"kammerlader\" was introduced in 1842, and it is thought that about 40,000 were manufactured until about 1870. While the first flintlock breech-loading rifles, such as the Ferguson, were launched decades before 1842 Norway was among the first European countries to introduce breech loaders on a large scale throughout its army and navy. The \"kammerladers\" were manufactured in several different models, and most models were at some point modified in some way or other.\n\nThe \"kammerladers\" were phased out as more modern rifles were approved for use. They were either modified for rimfire cartridges, sold off to civilians or melted for scrap. Rifles sold to civilians were often modified for use as shotguns or hunting firearms. Today it is hard to find an unmodified \"kammerlader\", and collectors often pay high prices for them.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Norwegian Army decided that the nature of warfare was changing away from the massed ranks firing in volleys towards smaller units advancing and firing independently. This conclusion was reached after having observed the American Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic Wars and the short Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814. Lessons were also learned from the Gunboat War, where small, mobile gunboats outmaneuvered larger, more heavily armed ships. It was decided that a breech loaded rifle was needed, more accurate than the old smoothbore muskets, yet quicker to load than the rifles issued to the Norwegian \"Jeger\" and \"Skijeger\" units. A special committee was created, and it started considering various firearm actions in 1837. It was soon clear that the desired weapon should:\n\n\nThe end result was that a modern, breech-loading rifle was approved for use on the 18 May 1842. The caliber chosen for the new rifle was 18 \"l\u00f8dig\" (gauge); in other words, one could manufacture 18 round bullets out of one Norwegian pound of lead. In modern terms this means the caliber of the rifle was 17.5\u00a0mm.\n\nFrom 1842, until the Remington M1867 was approved in 1867, more than 40,000 kammerladers in more than 80 different models were manufactured. In 1860 the caliber was reduced again, to four Swedish Linjer, or about 11.77\u00a0mm. When some of the \"Kammerladers\" were modified to rimfire after 1867, this meant that the barrels had to be bored out to 12.17\u00a0mm to accept the new cartridge.\n\nDuring a military sharpshooting competition held in Belgium in 1861, the \"Kammerlader\" was proven to be among the most accurate military long arms in Europe. The Norwegian rifles were shown to be accurate to a range of about , which is quite an achievement even by today's standards.\n\nEvery breechloader must have some form of mechanism that allows the breech to be opened for loading, yet securely locked for firing. This was even more important in the early designs made before the introduction of the cartridge. Achieving a gas-tight seal was difficult with the metallurgy of the day, and it can be argued that the Norwegian \"kammerladers\" are the first fully successful military breechloaders\u00a0\u2014 the needle gun was slightly earlier, but it leaks a significant gas pressure around the breech. A crank mounted on the side of the weapon operates the \"kammerlader\". Rotating the crank opens the breech of the weapon, allowing for loading. The use of paper cartridges\u00a0\u2014 a pre-measured amount of gunpowder and a lead bullet wrapped in paper\u00a0\u2014 also sped up the rate of fire. While not as fast as more modern rifles, which use fixed cartridges, the \"kammerlader\" was much faster than contemporary muzzleloading rifles. The loading sequence is as follows (refer to picture):\n\n\nThe exact rate of firing with the \"kammerlader\" depends, as with all manually operated weapons, entirely on the shooter. While the sources do not give any indication as to the rate of fire attainable by the average soldier, it is known that it was higher than for a muzzle loading musket\u00a0\u2014 roughly four rounds a minute\u00a0\u2014 and most probably lower than the contemporary German needle gun's 10 to 12 rounds a minute, since the \"kammerlader\" has a more elaborate loading procedure.\n\nMost of the rifles were modified during their service life. The first major modification was the change from a fixed rear sight mounted behind the receiver to an adjustable rear sight mounted in front of it. The first of the adjustable rear sights was a 'flip over' type: an L-shaped piece of metal that was hinged so it could 'flip' over. Later this was again modified to a design known in Norway as a 'ski hill sight'; a simple, yet functional, adjustable tangent sight. In principle, this latest sight doesn't differ from the iron sights found on most modern firearms. Towards the end of the service life of the \"kammerladers\", most of the small bore rifles were modified to allow the use of rim fire ammunition.\n\nThe \"kammerlader\" was designed to use paper cartridges\u00a0\u2014 a pre-measured amount of gunpowder and a lead bullet wrapped in paper\u00a0\u2014 both to speed up and simplify loading the weapon. In the early days of the rifle most units used round bullets in their weapons, but in 1855 it was decided that all units should use the a conical ball instead since this gave better accuracy. The paper was wrapped around the cylindrical section of the bullet and secured with wool string secured in the grooves. The end of the bullet was then covered in melted tallow, before the black powder was filled in behind the bullet and the end wrapped. For the 18 l\u00f8dig rifles, a load of 96 grains (6.22\u00a0g) was used. Sources vary in the reported muzzle velocity, but it is known that during tests in 1849, the bullet penetrated of wood at a distance of 800 alen (500\u00a0m).\n\nAfter the introduction of the Remington M1867 and its rimfire cartridge in 1867, the Norwegian Army and the Royal Norwegian Navy decided to convert some of the stock of \"kammerladers\" into rim fire rifles. There were two designs used for the modification: Landmarks and Lunds. Neither can be considered completely successful, but both were cheaper, and quicker, than manufacturing new M1867s. It seems that the Norwegian Army preferred the Lund, while the Landmark was the option of choice for the Royal Norwegian Navy.\n\nFor the \"Lund conversion\", the chamber was replaced with a breechblock, and an extractor was mounted on the left side of the receiver. A chamber fitting the 12.17 x 44 mm rimfire cartridge was milled out of the rear part of the barrel. The right side of the receiver was lowered 6\u00a0mm and the bottom plate exchanged from a brass plate to a steel plate with a track for the extractor. The firing pin was curved to allow the hammer to strike it.\n\nThe Landmark conversion refers to a modification invented by Jens Landmark. The chamber, which on a kammerlader is a separate piece tilted up and to the rear, is opened as before, but can be tilted further backwards by means of a hinge in the middle of the chamber. The 12.17 x 44 mm rim fire cartridge is placed backwards, facing the shooter, before everything is rolled back forward. The only part to be modified was the chamber and a curving firing pin was added where the nipple for the cap had been. Pictures showing the Landmark conversion can be found here \n\nA number of the \"kammerladers\" were also converted with the Remington action, by replacing the receivers but keeping the barrels and woodwork. These can be distinguished from ordinary Remington M1867s by having a shorter receiver with more rounded corners. It is unknown how many \"kammerladers\" were modified in this fashion.\n\nThe \"kammerlader\" rifles were manufactured over a period of 25 years (1842 to 1867) in a wide range of both military and civilian models. Almost all the military rifles were modified once or more, resulting in a very wide range of different models for a collector to collect.\n\n\nThe \"kammerladers\" were phased out as more modern weapons became available\u00a0\u2014 the Remington M1867, the Krag\u2013Petersson (adopted by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1876), and the Jarmann M1884. It is likely that the last of the modified naval \"kammerladers\" was not finally removed from military warehouses until after the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was approved for use in 1894, although sources are scarce on this. The rifles were either sold to civilians or melted down for scrap.\n\nMost of the rifles sold to civilians were turned into hunting implements, by replacing the barrel and/or the woodwork. Some of these were supposedly used for illegal hunting during World War II, when the occupying Germans had seized all modern weapons owned by civilians. Today it is hard to find a \"kammerlader\" in original condition, or indeed at all.\n\nThe \"kammerlader\" is often claimed to be an outstanding weapon for its time. The only contemporary rifle which it can be compared to is the Prussian needle gun\u00a0\u2014 the only other breech loader adopted for service in the 1840s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of various models and modifications:\n\"Various models of the kammerlader:\"\n\n\"Ammunition\"\n\n\"Modifications to rimfire:\"\n\n\"In use\"\n"}, {"id": "2166451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166451", "title": "Thangal Kunju Musaliar College of Engineering", "text": "Thangal Kunju Musaliar College of Engineering (TKMCE) is a government aided engineering institution in the Indian state of Kerala.

He attended Lanier High School in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was a McDonald's All-American and first-team \"Parade\" All-American. He entered the NBA directly out of high school, being drafted with the 40th overall pick by the Golden State Warriors in the 2005 NBA draft. In 2007, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. During his time in Golden State, he was one of the best scorers in the league, averaging close to 25 points per game on two occasions. After six and a half seasons with the Warriors, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in March 2012. A season and a half with the Bucks was followed by two seasons with the Dallas Mavericks and two seasons with the Indiana Pacers.\n\nEllis attended Lanier High School in Jackson, Mississippi. As a senior in 2004\u201305, Ellis led Lanier to its second state crown in four years, averaging 38.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 4.5 steals per game for a team that finished 35\u20132 and No. 3 in the FAB 50 national rankings. During his senior season, Ellis scored 65 points against Greenwood. The schools met again later that season, where Ellis had 72 points, a mark tied for second on the all-time state charts. He also had 46 points against Oak Hill Academy. For his efforts, Ellis was named 2005 EA SPORTS National Player of the Year and \"Parade\" co-Player of the Year with Greg Oden. Ellis led Lanier to a 129\u201316 record in his four seasons as a starter, winning the 4A state championship in both 2002 (33\u20135) and 2005 and runner-up finishes in 2003 (31\u20134) and 2004 (30\u20135). He finished ranked second in state history with 4,167 points, good for 28.7 points per game.\n\nEllis originally committed to Mississippi State University, but later decided to enter the NBA draft.\n\nEllis was selected with the 40th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. He appeared in 46 games as a rookie and made three starts, with all three coming over the last four games of the season. He averaged 6.8 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 18.1 minutes per game. In the Warriors' season finale on April 19, 2006, Ellis scored a season-high 27 points and had a chance to put the game into overtime, but his 3-pointer at the buzzer bounced off the rim, as Golden State lost 105\u2013102 to the Utah Jazz.\n\nEllis averaged 16.5 points, 4.1 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.7 steals in 2006\u201307, helping the Warriors return to the playoffs after a 12-year absence. Ellis increased his scoring by 9.7 points from his rookie season, the largest increase in the NBA. Starting 53 of the 77 games he appeared in, Ellis reached double figures in scoring 68 times, including 24 games of 20 or more points. He scored a season-high 31 points three times, twice in November and once in March. On February 24, Ellis recorded a career-high 13 assists against the Los Angeles Clippers. He recorded three or more steals 20 times and had at least five steals three times, including a career-high six against the Seattle SuperSonics on March 17, 2007. He was subsequently named the NBA Most Improved Player. In May, he helped the Warriors defeat the Dallas Mavericks in six games in the first round of the playoffs, becoming the first No. 8 seed to capture a best-of-seven playoff series. The Warriors went on to lose in five games to the Utah Jazz in the second round.\n\nEllis averaged a career-high 20.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.53 steals in 37.9 minutes in 81 games during the 2007\u201308 season. He ranked 14th in the NBA in field goal percentage (.531, 3rd among all guards), 15th in steals and 25th in scoring. He became only the ninth guard in NBA history to shoot 60% from the floor for an entire month in February (.602). He scored a career-high 39 points on January 24 against the New Jersey Nets and scored 30-plus points on 12 occasions overall.\n\nOn July 24, 2008, Ellis re-signed with the Warriors to a six-year, $66 million contract. However, in August, he was sidelined for three-plus months after suffering a Grade 3 high ankle sprain, a torn deltoid ligament and a syndesmosis disruption of his left ankle that required surgery. The injuries occurred in a motorized scooter accident, but his mistake was compounded by telling the Warriors he hurt himself playing pickup ball in his native Mississippi, only coming clean about the accident several days later. As a result, he was suspended by the Warriors for 30 games without pay\u2014the approximate number of games he was expected to miss with the injury anyway.\n\nEllis made his season debut on January 23, 2009, scoring 20 points in a 106\u2013105 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Between late February and early March, Ellis missed six straight games with a back injury. Then between late March and early April, he missed seven straight games with the flu. Ellis solidified himself as one of the top guards in the NBA and in the process emerged as the team's true leader. His career-best 25.5 points per game was second among Western Conference guards and sixth overall in the NBA and he also ranked among the NBA leaders in steals (2nd, 2.23 spg) and minutes played (1st, 41.4 mpg).\n\nIn the Warriors' season opener on October 27, 2010, Ellis matched his career high with 46 points in a 132\u2013128 win over the Houston Rockets, setting the third-best total by a Warriors player in a season opener. Only Wilt Chamberlain, who had 48 points in 1961 and 56 points in 1962, had more. On November 19, he scored 40 points in a 125\u2013119 loss to the New York Knicks.

For the season, he ranked eighth in scoring (24.1 ppg), first in minutes (40.3 mpg) and third in steals (2.10 spg). Many around the league thought that Ellis was deserving of being an All-Star.\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Ellis scored 38 points in a 101\u201395 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On February 7, he scored a career-high 48 points in a 119\u2013116 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

In his first playoff appearance since 2007 with Golden State, the Bucks were swept by the Miami Heat in the first round. Ellis averaged 19.2 points in 2012\u201313 but had the lowest 3-point shooting percentage among eligible players at 28.7 percent.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Ellis signed a three-year, $25 million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. He joined the Mavericks with questions about his efficiency on offense. The 2013\u201314 season saw Ellis start in all 82 games for the Mavericks. In his debut for the Mavericks on October 30, 2013, Ellis scored 32 points in a 118\u2013109 season-opening win over the Atlanta Hawks. He was 11 of 17 from the field and had eight assists.

In the Mavericks' five-game first-round playoff series loss to the Rockets, Ellis averaged 26.0 points per game, including scoring a playoff career-high 34 points in a 130\u2013128 loss in game three and 31 points in a 121\u2013109 win in game four.\n\nOn June 24, 2015, Ellis decided not to pick up the option for the final year of his contract with the Mavericks, thus becoming a free agent. He underwent surgery on his right knee before the start of free agency, with the procedure described as \"minor\".\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Ellis signed a four-year, $44 million contract with the Indiana Pacers. He appeared in 81 games in 2015\u201316, all as a starter, sitting out only the regular-season finale ahead of the playoffs.

Upon returning from injury, he lost his starting spot to Glenn Robinson III. In 74 games, he made 33 starts and averaged 8.5 points, 2.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.1 steals in 27.0 minutes per game.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, Ellis was waived by the Pacers. He will be paid by the Pacers through the 2021-2022 season.\n\nEllis is the son of Marcella Singleton and Rosa Ellis. Older brother Antwain Ellis was his basketball hero growing up. Ellis and his wife, Juanika, have two children. Ellis is a sneakerhead and an avid fisherman.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166476", "title": "Sinus tachycardia", "text": "Sinus tachycardia (also colloquially known as sinus tach or sinus tachy) is an elevated sinus rhythm characterized by an increase in the rate of electrical impulses arising from the sinoatrial node. In adults, sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats/min (bpm). The normal resting heart rate is 60\u2013100 bpm in an average male adult and 60-90 bpm in an average female adult. Normal heart rate varies with age, from infants having faster heart rates (110-150 bpm) and the elderly having slower heart rates. Sinus tachycardia is a normal response to physical exercise, when the heart rate increases to meet the body's higher demand for energy and oxygen, but sinus tachycardia can also indicate a health problem. Thus, sinus tachycardia is a medical finding that can be either physiological or pathological.\n\nTachycardia is often asymptomatic. It is often a resulting symptom of a primary disease state and can be an indication of the severity of a disease. If the heart rate is too high, cardiac output may fall due to the markedly reduced ventricular filling time. Rapid rates, though they may be compensating for ischemia elsewhere, increase myocardial oxygen demand and reduce coronary blood flow, thus precipitating an ischemic heart or valvular disease. Sinus tachycardia accompanying a myocardial infarction may be indicative of cardiogenic shock.\n\nSinus tachycardia is usually a response to physiological stress, such as exercise, or an increased sympathetic tone with increased catecholamine release, such as stress, fright, flight, and anger. Other causes include:\n\nSinus tachycardia is usually apparent on an ECG, but if heart rate is above 140 bpm the P wave may be difficult to distinguish from the previous T wave and one may confuse it with a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Ways to distinguish the three are:\n\n\nIn inappropriate sinus tachycardia (also known as chronic nonparoxysmal sinus tachycardia), patients have elevated resting heart rate and/or exaggerated heart rate in response to exercise. These patients have no apparent heart disease or other causes of sinus tachycardia. IST is thought to be due to abnormal autonomic control.\n\nUsually in women with no heart problems, this syndrome is characterized by normal resting heart rate but exaggerated postural sinus tachycardia with or without orthostatic hypotension.\n\nTreatment for physiologic sinus tachycardia involves treating the underlying causes of the tachycardia response. Beta blockers may be used to decrease tachycardia in patients with certain conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and rate-related angina. In patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, careful titration of beta blockers, salt loading, and hydration typically reduce symptoms. Patients who are unresponsive to such treatment can undergo catheter ablation to potentially repair the sinus node.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction. Sinus tachycardia can present in more than a third of the patients with AMI but this usually decreases over time. Patients with sustained sinus tachycardia reflects a larger infarct that are more anterior with prominent left ventricular dysfunction, associated with high mortality and morbidity. Tachycardia in the presence of AMI can reduce coronary blood flow and increase myocardial oxygen demand, aggravating the situation. Beta blockers can be used to slow the rate, but most patients are usually already treated with beta blockers as a routine regimen for AMI.\n\nIST and POTS.

His work on Cassandra Anderson has been called \"photo-realistic\".\n\nBorn in 1939, Ranson's childhood and formative years included access to the influences of art and artists in a mixture of British and American comics, including \"[The] Beano, Knockout, [The] Dandy, Film Fun, Wizard, Hotspur..., The Eagle with Frank Hampson setting new standards. Wayne Boring's Superman, C.C. Beck's Captain Marvel,\" and others (including, \"[l]ater, John Buscema's Silver Surfer and his Conan, Jack Kirby's Thor\"). He says that Hampson in particular was an early influence, but that \nRanson attended the South West Essex Technical College and School of Art in Walthamstow, Essex, where he studied painting and printmaking. Trained initially as an \"apprentice stamp and banknote designer\" in the 1960s, learning \"to translate photographs into watercolour... [i]n stamp size.\" A \"rare ability at the time,\" he would later use this skill as a \"selling point\" when pursuing a career \"as an illustrator in advertising and publishing.\"\n\nAfter a period of time as a \"[l]ettering artist for a cardboard box manufacturer\", followed by teaching work, he says he \"[r]an away to London.\" After some time in menial jobs, Ranson gained experience as a \"[g]eneral patcher-up and filler-in at [a] commercial art studio,\" where he was encouraged to become a freelance artist by, he recalls\nRanson has a son, Jonas, who is also an artist, and daughter, Cassandra.\n\nRanson first brought the precise techniques he had evolved through his apprenticeship to the UK TV comic \"Look-in\", working first on portrait covers, and later alongside other major comics artists such as John M. Burns, Martin Asbury, Harry North, Colin Wyatt, John Bolton, Jim Baikie, Phil Gascoine, Barry Mitchell, and Bill Titcombe.\n\nAfter some time drawing \"funnies\", Ranson drew on his skill in translating pictures across mediums (generally using a Grant Projector, which \"projects an image up onto a glass plate, on which one places tracing paper\"), and brought his talents to bear for \"Look-in\" by creating strips based on such popular TV series as \"Sapphire and Steel\" and \"Danger Mouse\", all written by Angus Allan. Since these works were based on specific TV shows, he says that \"it seemed important that the characters looked as much like the actors as possible\", and thus \"used the methods I knew\" to achieve the accurate likenesses that typify his work.\n\nRanson also produced a series of comic-strip biographies of well-known music stars and bands, including ABBA (1977), Elvis Presley (1981), The Beatles (1981-2), Haircut One Hundred (1983) and The Sex Pistols (1983). Most biographical articles on Ranson date his Beatles work to \"the 1960s,\" but Ranson himself dispels this myth by stating that the \"first auto-biographical [sic] strip I did was ABBA.\" In fact that work was done in 1981.\n\nRanson recalls that \"Look-in\" editor Colin Shelbourne was convinced to allow Allan and Ranson to \"retain... the copyright\" to their Elvis and Beatles strips, which had the unfortunate side-effect of delaying complete publication, since such deals were largely unheard of. Ranson says:\nRanson describes Shelbourne as \"an adventurous editor,\" who went the extra mile and even allowed the writer and artist to \"go to Liverpool for research\" for the Beatles strip.\n\nRanson's best-known work for \"Look-in\" consisted largely of adaptations of two strips based upon totally different British television programmes. The first of these was a strip based on P. J. Hammond's \"Sapphire & Steel\", which Ranson was \"the first and only one to draw\" between 1979 and 1981. Scripted by Angus Allan (almost \"Look-in\"s sole writer, according to Ranson), Ranson barely recalls drawing the strip, but does remember that \n\nRanson was denied the chance to meet \"Sapphire & Steel\" star Joanna Lumley by being absent when she visited the offices. He recalls that, unfortunately, while \"[s]he was kind enough to offer to meet me and pose for more photo-reference,\" \"[s]omeone told her that no, that would not be necessary. Stupid sods.\"\n\nIn 2007, Prion Books reprinted a selection of material from \"Look-in\", and included a three-part \"Sapphire & Steel\" story on pages 132-133, 136-137 and 140-141.\n\nRanson's other famous strip for \"Look-in\" was Danger Mouse, an unlikely children's cartoon hero based - loosely - on the Patrick McGoohan TV series \"Danger Man\", created in cartoon mouse form by Cosgrove Hall and voiced on TV by David Jason. Ranson says that he \"did enjoy it at the time,\" and was awarded not only the \"Good Grief Oh Crikey\" Award from Cosgrove Hall (\"The award is a painted model of Dangermouse in heroic pose with a nervous Penfold peering from behind him\"), but also received an award from the Society of Strip Illustration for his work on the strip.\n\nRanson wryly notes that \"[t]he reflected glory from the highly popular TV show made me a big hit with my daughter's primary school friends too.\"\n\nBetween 1977 and 1990, Ranson also produced strips based on such TV properties as \"Worzel Gummidge\", \"Michael Bentine's Potty Time\", \"Duckula\" (another Cosgrove Hall character whose comics adventures began in \"Look-in\", but also spun off into its own title), \"The Bionic Woman\" and \"The A-Team\", and others. He also produced comic strips based on the TV adaptations of Richmal Crompton's \"\"Just William\"\" novels, Buck Rogers and the film Logan's Run.\n\nRanson also worked briefly for Marvel UK in the late 1980s, and even illustrated a couple of issues of the comics adventures of Dr. Who for \"Doctor Who Magazine\" in 1990.\n\nAside from his \"Look-in\" and (later) \"2000AD\" comics work, Ranson also produced illustrations for Fiesta and some \"[a]dvertising work through an agent, [including] some All-Bran adverts.\" He produced some assorted work for various other IPC magazines in addition to \"2000AD\", and was glad of the \"more challenging\" work to be found in comics, branding himself \"too sensitive a plant to get on in advertising despite the high fees.\"\n\nRanson stresses the influence of his peers - particularly Brian Bolland - on his own evolution as an artist, moving from being burdened by the \"British way of drawing adventure comics... dependable, professional, craftsmanlike and worthy,\" to seeing and being influenced by work that \"looked as though [the artist, particularly Bolland] really cared about it.\"\n\nRanson stresses the importance of artist Brian Bolland, saying that\nIn 1989, Ranson followed in Bolland\u2014and others'\u2014footsteps, and moved to major British sci-fi comic \"2000 AD\", where he has remained ever since, with rare forays into the world of American comics, including Batman and the X-Men. He counts himself lucky that this career path has, in his decades-long comics career seen him work primarily with just three writers.\n\nRanson's first work for\" 2000 AD\" was a one-off Judge Dredd story \"Dungeon Master\" by John Wagner. It was followed by the ten-part \"Anderson: Psi Division - \"Triad\"\" storyline, which started in Prog #635 (15 July, 1989). David Bishop, in the \"2000 AD \"history volume \"Thrill Power Overload\" says that Ranson's\nA spin-off from Judge Dredd, Cassandra Anderson is a Judge with psychic skills, including telepathy and precognition.\n\nOver the next fifteen years, Ranson drew a dozen more serials featuring Judge Anderson, working with writer Alan Grant, who says that since their first collaboration\n\nAsked about the changes Anderson had undergone during his 15-years working on her stories, Ranson believed that she had indeed changed\nRanson admits to feeling \"quite possessive of her\", and considers her \"the most human of any comic hero I am aware of, and [one who] deals with some of the knottier problems of being human \u2013 morality, mortality, meaning.\" He is especially fond of working on stories in which Anderson is \"aware of\" her age (of \"being between forty and fifty years old\") while still \"retain[ing her] likeness and... glamour.\"\n\nIn 1990, 2000AD stalwarts Kevin O'Neill, Pat Mills, John Wagner, Alan Grant and Mike McMahon were invited by Geoff Fry to begin work on a publication for Neptune Distribution. Neptune had acquired premiere British fanzine \"Fantasy Advertiser\" in 1988, and sold-out an issue featuring Mills & O'Neill's \"Marshal Law\", prompting the move towards creating a line of comics spearheaded by that character.\n\nHaving formed an imprint - Apocalypse Ltd - the publish the new anthology title, Pat Mills found himself de facto editor of the in-preparation title, now called \"Toxic!\". Amid some turmoil, the initial five creators began to splinter, with Wagner in particular feeling that his \"style, the way I write, had itself been deemed un-\"Toxic!\"\" The strip he had spent some time working on was vetoed by Mills, who felt that it was \"far too close to \"2000 AD\" in style.\" It eventually fell to the new editor - Dan Abnett, head-hunted from Marvel UK - to inform Wagner. He recalls that \"[b]y that stage Arthur Ranson had drawn an awful lot of it.\"\n\nThe strip - called \"Button Man\" - was shelved half-finished. \"Toxic!\" was cancelled in October, 1991 after 31 issues.\n\nIn the spring of 1992, as part of a promotion called \"the Mega-Blast,\" \"Button Man\" was resurrected and launched in Prog 780. Ultra-violent and one of the first non-science fictional strips to appear in the comic's 15-year history, \"Button Man\" was one of the very few creator-owned strips to appear in \"2000 AD\". Then-editor Steve MacManus sums it up by saying\n\nRanson says that:\nThe first \"Button Man\" serial was collected in 1994 by Kitchen Sink Press, and again by Rebellion in 2003. Ranson remembers that he \"[made] a small change to the end of \"Button Man\",\" but praises Wagner's storytelling abilities, for being \"self-contained. Complete in themselves, neat, compact and satisfying, solid.\" A second story followed in 1994, and the third made its debut \"after an absence of six years\" in 2001. Writer John Wagner candidly stated that he believes \"My writing and Arthur's art were patchier on the third series, but I believe the plot was the best of the three.\"\n\nIn 2007, Wagner wrote a fourth series, as well pursuing prospects for a big screen adaptation of the series.\n\nIn 1993, Grant and Ranson contributed the two-part story \"Tao\" to DC Comics' \"Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight\" series (issues #52-53).\n\nIn 1997, Ranson provided the artwork for a one-shot prestige-format single issue for DC Comics, \"Batman/Phantom Stranger\". Written by one of Ranson's frequent collaborators, Alan Grant (a mainstay at \"2000 AD\", and also a major contributor to the Batman mythos), the story saw the two characters team-up to \"solve the mystery of a missing civilization.\" Grant and Ranson had previously produced \"an outline of a Phantom Stranger story [Ranson] wanted to draw,\" but were rebuffed. Indeed, Ranson recalls that Grant was asked to write in \"Batman/Phantom Stranger\" a Stranger who \"must do nothing spooky.\"\n\nHe worked on a number of X-Men-related comics for Marvel. However, he says that he does not \"believe my style suits ,\" and did not enjoy working from scripts written by American writers who, he felt must have \"watched too much television as children,\" peppering their scripts with TV/film terminology and tropes.\n\nDue to his use of photographs as reference materials, Ranson has included cameos of friends, colleagues and family in several of his stories.

The area was formerly the large tidal estuary of the Afon Glaslyn. It was created after large-scale land reclamation occurred in the late 18th century and the early 19th century. A large embankment, called the Cob, separates the area from the sea and carries a road and railway line.\n\nThe original estuary of the \"Afon Glaslyn\" was a dangerous place; many people were said to have died in the quicksands trying to cross the Traeth Mawr. In the late 18th century, various landowners around the edge of the estuary began to systematically reclaim land of between and . Between 1770 and 1800 this resulted in the creation of about of new land.\n\nAround 1798, William Madocks bought the Tan-yr-Allt estate near Penmorfa Marsh. Soon afterwards he reclaimed an area of sand from the sea and the river by building a earthen bank from Prenteg to Clog-y-Berth (now Porthmadog). The township of Tremadog was founded within the new area. A wooden-tracked railway was used in the dyke's construction. The rails were later used by the Croesor Tramway.\n\nIn 1807 Madocks obtained a Private Act of Parliament permitting him to complete the reclamation of Traeth Mawr. Between 1808 and 1811 an embankment called \"the Cob\" was constructed from the island of \"Ynys Towyn\" (now part of Porthmadog) to Boston Lodge in the Meirionnydd. The massive stone-lined earthwork was long, wide at the bottom, tapering to at the top, which was above the level of the river. The work completed the reclamation of of Traeth Mawr.\n\nSoon after completion in 1812, the embankment was breached in a violent storm. Repairs were completed by the end of September 1814. Although the original estimate to complete The Cob was \u00a323,500 (\u00a316.9million in 2014), it eventually cost Madocks \u00a360,000 (\u00a343.3million in 2014) to finish. At its seaward end, Traeth Mawr joins \"Traeth Bach\" (\"little sands\"), the estuary of the Afon Dwyryd.\n\nIn 1836, the Ffestiniog Railway began using The Cob when it built a tramroad to transport slate from the quarries around the inland town of Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog where it was loaded onto ships. Empty wagons were hauled back up to the quarries by horses. Loaded dandy waggons used gravity to run downhill from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port across The Cob. After a number of trials and some modifications, the line was upgraded to a narrow gauge railway in 1863. In 1927 the Cob was breached again, and took several months to repair.\n\nA carriageway was also constructed at a lower level on the inland side to take a public highway. Until September 2003, when The Cob was bought by the Welsh Assembly Government, all vehicles crossing the embankment were required to pay a toll. The collection of fees often caused traffic jams at peak holiday travel times: it was not exceptional for queues to back up to in each direction. In 2002, the highway across the Cob was widened while a separate path was added for walkers and cyclists. The pedestrian route now forms part of L\u00f4n Las Cymru, the national cycle route from Holyhead to Cardiff.\n\nIn 2010 work started on the Porthmadog, Minffordd and Tremadog bypass to reduce the amount of through traffic in the town. On completion the original course of the A487 across \"The Cob\" was renumbered as the A4971. \n\nIn 2012, of the embankment were widened on the seaward side of the Porthmadog end to allow a second platform to be constructed at the Ffestiniog & Welsh Highland Railway's Harbour Station.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166498", "title": "Johan Petro", "text": "Johan \u201cEscargot\u201d Petro (born January 27, 1986) is a French former professional basketball player of Guadeloupean descent, who last played for the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League.

The exact time during which Khaba ruled is unknown but may have been around 2670\u00a0BC.\n\nKing Khaba is considered to be difficult to assess as a figure of ancient Egypt. His name is archaeologically well-attested by stone bowls and mud seal impressions. Khaba's reign is securely dated to the Third Dynasty. Because of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, his exact chronological position within the dynasty remains disputed. These problems originate in part from contradictory king lists, which were all compiled long after Khaba's death, especially during the Ramesside era. It is also a matter of debate as to where Khaba might have been buried. Many Egyptologists and archaeologists propose that an unfinished Layer Pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan belongs to him. Others believe instead that his tomb is a large mastaba close to the Layer Pyramid, where numerous stone vessels bearing Khaba's serekh have been found.\n\nKhaba's name appears on nine polished stone bowls, variously made of magnesite, travertine, and diorite, which were found at the archaeological locales of Zawyet el'Aryan, Abusir, and Naga-ed-Deir. The bowls were found mostly intact; they show only the king's serekh name on their polished surfaces. As was conventional at the time they were made, they contain no additional inscriptions for context.\n\nHis name also appears on several mud seal impressions found at Quesna (in the Delta), Zawyet el'Aryan, Hierakonpolis, and Elephantine. Most of the mud seals were excavated at modern-day Elephantine; it is possible that more of them lie under the garden of the current museum of Elephantine. These seal impressions bear more inscriptions than the stone bowls, however most of the seals are only preserved as small fragments and their surfaces have been roughened over the years.\n\nOnly one seal bears a well-preserved complete row of names or titles; the seal, numbered \"UC-11755\", is undated and is now on display in the Petrie Museum, London. The inscription alternates between Horus and Golden Horus names.\n\nKhaba is known by his serekh and Golden Horus name only. His \"Nisut-Bity\" title and his \"Nebty name\" are unknown. Additionally, Khaba is one of the very few kings from Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom times with an archaeologically proven Gold name, a likely predecessor to the Golden Horus name, which Khaba may also have introduced. Aside from Khaba, the only kings with Gold names who lived before king Sneferu, founder of the 4th dynasty, were Djer, Den, Nynetjer, Khasekhemwy, and Djoser. From Snefru onward, the Golden Horus name became a fixed royal title to any ruling king, no matter how long the king ruled. Khaba's Golden Horus name can be found on several seal impressions, although its correct reading and translation are disputed. Peter Kaplony interprets it as \"Nub-iret\" or \"Nub iret-djedef\", though he is unsure whether the syllable \"djedef\" was an inherent part of the name or an additional honorary title. Thomas Schneider and J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath, in contrast, see Khaba's Golden Horus as \"Netjer-nub\", which means \"golden falcon\". Khaba's Gold name is the first to show the infinitive form of the royal Gold name.\n\nScholars face several problems in attempting to connect Khaba to royal names known from the Ramesside era (the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties). Unfortunately, these lists offer no clear consensus about the number or names of the kings of the 3rd dynasty. The Abydos king list gives \"Nebka\", \"Djoser\", \"Teti\", \"Sedjes\", and \"Neferkar\u00ea\", while the Turin Canon offers \"Nebka\", \"Djoser\", \"Djoserteti\", \"Hudjefa\", and \"Huni\". The kinglist of Saqqara lists \"Djoser\", \"Djoserteti\", \"Nebkar\u00ea\", and \"Huni\". The ancient historian Manetho gives nine names: \"Necher\u00f3phes\", \"Tosorthr\u00f3s\", \"T\u00fdreis\", \"Mes\u00f4chris\", \"S\u00f4\u00ffphis\", \"T\u00f3sertasis\", \"Ach\u00eas\", \"S\u00eaphuris\", and \"Kerpher\u00eas\". Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, for example, identifies Khaba with the Ramesside cartouche name \"Teti\".\n\nIn contrast, Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck and Aidan Dodson suggest that Khaba could have been identical to the Ramesside names \"Sedjes\" and \"Hudjefa II\". Both \"names\" are actually pseudonyms for a royal title that was illegible when the Ramesside scribes compiled the kinglists. This would match a king who ruled only a short time. The Turin Canon gives a short reign of 6 years for Hudjefa II.\n\nA minority of modern Egyptologists think that Khaba might be identical to a Ramesside cartouche name known as Huni. This name can be credited to a king who is handed down by the Ramesside scribes as the last ruler of the 3rd dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck, and Toby Wilkinson point to a step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, called the Layer Pyramid. This monument is assigned to Khaba (see section below) and since Stadelmann and Wilkinson hold that the pyramid was finished, they believe that a long-reigning king, such as king Huni, would have been necessary to oversee the project. Huni is attested in the Turin Canon to have reigned for 24 years. In addition, Stadelmann points to the seal impressions found at Elephantine: they come from a site very close to a stepped pyramid which is said to have been built by Huni.\n\nIt is also unknown under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho listed Khaba. He might have been the same person as the listed \"Mes\u00f4chris\" or \"S\u00f4\u00ffphis\", but this in turn is doubted by Wolfgang Helck and Eberhard Otto. They connect both names with king Sanakht.\n\nBecause of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological position of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable \"kha\". As a comparison, he points to the names \"Netjerikhet\" (Djoser) and \"Sekhemkhet\" (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.\n\nHowever, Swelim's theory is not widely accepted. Grimal, Helck, Wilkinson and Stadelmann point out that during the 3rd dynasty it became a fashion that royal stone bowls with polished surfaces showed only Horus names, without any guiding inscriptions. This is also the case for the stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor style was practiced still under Sneferu, the founder of the 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close to the end of the Third Dynasty.\n\nThe correct duration of Khaba's reign is also unknown. Should he be identical to the Ramesside cartouche names \"Sedjes\" (meaning \"omitted\") and \"Hudjefa\" (meaning \"erased\"), he might have ruled for six years, as the Turin Canon suggests. If Khaba was identical to king Huni, he might have ruled for 24 years.\n\nThe current archaeological situation allows no closer evaluation of Khaba's reign. The seal impressions from Elephantine only prove that this island seems to have been an important place to visit in Khaba's time. The inscriptions reveal that the seals and their belonging vessels originated from Thinis and that they were registered by the governor of Elephantine. Other seals show the depiction of the goddess Bastet. The Hierakonpolis seal was found in early dynastic ruins of a local Horus temple. It shows traces of the image of a god, possibly Ash.\n\nKhaba is commonly thought to have built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8\u00a0km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's construction is typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made of rough blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about tall, but is now only . It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. While there are no inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears on stone bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.\n\nAlternatively, Khaba could have been interred in the aforementioned mastaba, which is located about north of the pyramid. Indeed, excavations of the mastaba yielded several stone bowls inscribed with Khaba's Horus name as well as two seal fragments of him. Although this is generally taken as a proof that Khaba was the pyramid owner, it could equally imply that the mastaba was Khaba's tomb and the pyramid that of another, yet unknown king.\n\nOnly two large mastaba tombs can be securely dated into Khaba's reign. The first one is known as Mastaba Z500, which is located at Zawyet el'Aryan. It lies around 200m north of the Layer Pyramid and has a south-north-orientation. The mastaba ist made of mudbricks, its outer wall is niched and it contains only two large chambers without any typical tomb architecture elements. Because of this, Egyptologists such as Nabil Swelim believe that Mastaba Z500 was in fact a mortuary temple, belonging to the funerary complex of the Layer Pyramid. The datation of the building into Khaba's reign is based on numerous diorite and dolomite vessels and mud seal fragments, bearing the serekh name of king Khaba.\n\nIn 2010, an unknown mudbrick mastaba was discovered in Quesna, an archaeological site located in the Monufia Governorate (in the Nile Delta). The mastaba was once 14m in length and 6m in width. Its substructure contains a 3m wide corridor chapel, divided into three architectural sections: the first (northern) section is filled with rubble, the second (central) section contains a double room as the burial chamber and the third (southern) section has a burial shaft in its center. In 2014, a tiny mud seal fragment with the king's name was discovered inside. The true owner of the tomb, however, is unknown and archaeological excavations are still on-going.\n"}, {"id": "2166505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166505", "title": "Boo Cook", "text": "Boo Cook (born 1972) is a British comic artist, whose work mainly features in the comic \"2000 AD\".\n\nCook's art has appeared in the \"ABC Warriors\" and \"Judge Dredd\", as \"Asylum\" (written by Rob Williams) and \"Dead Men Walking\" (written by David Bishop).\n\nIn 2005, Cook graduated to regular work on the flagship story on \"2000 AD\", \"Judge Dredd\", mostly to scripts by Gordon Rennie and Simon Spurrier.

Ibn al-Aftas added to his name the Laqab \"al-Mansur Billah\", \"Victorious by Grace of God\", and ruled over an extensive part of the Al Garb Al Andalus, from the Douro river to the south of Tagus river, establishing the Taifa of Badajoz. Ibn al-Aftas died in 1045.\n\nUnder Ibn al-Aftas' successors, Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Abdallah al-Muzzaffar (1045\u20131065) and his two sons 'Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mutawakkil (1065-1094 in \u00c9vora) and Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Mansur (1065-1072 in Badajoz), the Taifa of Badajoz not only controlled large expanses of western Spain and Portugal, but was also a major centre of Islamic culture, which was fostered by the Aftasid rulers. In 1055, Badajoz came under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n-Castile and was forced to pay tribute. The taifa lost control over significant parts of its territory, south of the Mondego river (south of Coimbra). The Abbadid dynasty of Seville conquered parts of their territory. In 1094, the kingdom was annexed by the Almoravid dynasty. Badajoz was taken at the end of 1095 by the Almoravid general Abu Bakr, with the connivance of the inhabitants who were fed up of the fiscal exactions of their emir, Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mutawakkil.\n\nAl-Mutawakkil and two of his sons Al-Fadl and S'ad, were taken prisoner and sent to Seville, but were executed before their arrival, which was eulogized in a poem by Ibn 'Abdun. Another son of Al-Mutawakkil, Al-Mansur, escaped and fortified himself for some time in the castle of Montanchez, in the modern province of Caceres, and finally together with his followers, migrated into the dominions of Alfonso VI, where he abandoned Islam for Christianity.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166510", "title": "Rasolo", "text": "Rasolo was a Fijian High Chief.\n\nFather of Rasolo was Chief Niumataiwalu of Lakeba.

He attended preparatory school at Lawrence Academy at Groton; in 2002, he led the Spartans to an Independent School League Basketball Championship. After his junior year at Texas A&M University, he was selected 15th overall in the 2005 NBA Draft by the Nets, the highest pick from the Big 12 Conference that year and in Texas A&M University history until Acie Law was drafted 11th in the 2007 NBA Draft. Wright played his first five seasons of professional basketball in the NBA. He has since played overseas and in the NBA D-League.\n\nWright was born in West Covina, California to Wanda Wright. He attended the Lawrence Academy prep school in Groton, Massachusetts, where in his three seasons he started 115 games and amassed 1800 points, 500 rebounds, 350 assists, 170 steals and 200 blocked shots. His career single game highs were 50 points, 14 rebounds, and 8 assists.\n\nAs a sophomore (1999\u20132000), Wright averaged 20 points per game, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists, helping his school to a 15\u201312 record and earning him All-ISL and team MVP honors. The following year, his junior season, the team improved to a 23\u20132 record and Number 11 state ranking behind Wright's average 23.0 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. He was named MVP of the 2001 playoffs and earned All-ISL and All-Scholastic honors.\n\nIn his senior year, Wright, who averaged 26.5 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists, was again named the MVP of the playoffs and earning All-ISL and All-Scholastic rankings as his team reached a Number 7 state ranking. Wright was named the Number 1 prep shooting guard in the country by ESPN.com, who also ranked him the Number 4 overall prospect. He was also named third-team Parade All-American. He was also dismissed from the High School months before graduating for disciplinary reasons.\n\nWright joined the USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team in 2002, with the team earning a bronze medal for their 4\u20131 record; Wright averaged 6.8 points per game, 4.4 rebounds per game, and a team second best 2.4 steals per game. The medal qualified the team for a berth in the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championships. He recorded tournaments bests of 10 points in the USA's preliminary round victory over the Dominican Republic and seven rebounds in their semifinal loss to Venezuela.\n\nWright was heavily recruited, entertaining scholarship offers from schools including Arizona, Maryland, Connecticut, UNC, Texas and Arizona State University. He chose to attend Texas A&M University and play under coach Melvin Watkins, primarily to show his loyalty to the coaching staff who had noticed him long before the other schools began wooing him.\n\nAntoine Wright had a phenomenal season in his first year at Texas A&M University, becoming the consensus Big 12 Conference Freshman of the year. Leading the Aggies with 6.6 rebounds per game, .7 blocks per game, 1.3 steals per game, and 2.3 three-pointers made per game, Wright's 14.5 points per game made him the second-highest scorer on the team, and one of only five freshmen in the nation to average 14.0 points and 6 rebounds. He had eight games where he scored more than 20 points, and 10 additional games where he scored 10 or more points. He scored a season-high 25 points in games against Miami and Texas. His best game, however, came against Kansas State University, in which he scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds.\n\nDespite a tough year for the Aggies, who lost all 16 of their conference games, Wright who started in 26 of the 28 games in which he played, was named an Honorable Mention All-Big 12 player. He led the Aggies in scoring (13.5 points per game), three-point field goals (47) and blocked shots (98). Against Grambling, Wright scored a career-high 32 points, including 5 3-pointers. He recorded a career-high 12 rebounds against Kansas while also scoring 24 points. In the Big 12 Tournament, he scored 22 points in a game against Missouri.\n\nAfter Coach Watkins was pressured to resign during the Big 12 Tournament, Wright seriously considered transferring to a different school or entering the draft early. He met with new coach Billy Gillispie, who told him that he needed one great year to become a first round draft pick, and vowed to help Wright attain that goal. Wright was still not completely convinced, until, after returning late from a weekend trip to Atlanta, Georgia, Gillispie suspended him for breaking the rules. As he watched his teammates complete their off-season workouts without him, he noticed that the players were beginning to look tougher and better, and Wright decided to stay and join them.\n\nAs a junior, Wright ranked fourth in the Big 12 in scoring, with 17.8 points per game, and led the league in three-point completion percentage (.447). His 36 steals were a team high, and he blocked 22 shots, second only to Joseph Jones for the Aggies. He tied his career-high 32 points in a game against Colorado, including making all 11 of his free-throw attempts. Against Texas Tech he scored 29 points, converting 7 of his 8 three-point attempts. These accomplishments made him the first Aggie to be named to First Team All-Big 12 by the Associated Press.\n\nWith Wright's assistance, under new coach Gillispie the team exhibited a dramatic turnaround, earning an invitation to the NIT. The team made it to the NIT quarterfinals, their best postseason performance since 1982, when they lost in the NIT quarterfinals. Wright scored 21 points on 7-for-12 shooting in their quarterfinal loss to St. Joseph's.\n\nWright chose to leave the Aggies after his junior year to join the 2005 NBA Draft. His 1,338 career points rank tenth on the Texas A&M all-time leading scorer list, while his 181 three-point field goals place him second, and his 50 blocks put him in 11th place of all Aggie basketball players.\n\nAlthough Wright was projected before the draft as a consensus top 12 pick, the New Jersey Nets actually selected him as the 15th overall pick, making him the third Aggie draft pick in 29 years. This was the first time an Aggie had been taken in the first round of the NBA draft since Sonny Parker in 1976 and also set the mark for the highest an Aggie had ever been drafted, beating Parker's 17th pick. That record would be broken two years later when the Atlanta Hawks drafted Acie Law with the 11th overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft\n\nDuring his first season as a professional basketball player, Wright played in thirty-nine games for the Nets, averaging 1.8 points, 0.8 rebounds, 0.3 assists, and 9.5 minutes per game. He was forced to sit out the beginning of the season on the inactive list, but began gaining minutes as the season progressed, eventually becoming part of the rotation. Although Wright was drafted for his jump shot, he shot only 35% from the field.\n\nWright's 2006\u201307 season began much better, as he became a big part of coach Lawrence Frank's rotation. After starter Richard Jefferson injured his ankle against the Miami Heat, Wright took his place in the starting lineup. He was averaging 28.2 minutes per game and chipping in 8.5 points per game, and 4.5 rebounds per game off the bench.\n\nAn ankle injury caused Wright to miss eight games in the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nWright was part of a trade that sent Jason Kidd, Malik Allen, and himself to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Devin Harris, DeSagana Diop, Trenton Hassell, Maurice Ager, Keith Van Horn and future draft picks.\n\nHe scored a career-high of 24 points over 39 minutes in the 109\u2013106 victory against the Indiana Pacers on November 25, 2008.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors acquired Antoine Wright and Devean George from the Dallas Mavericks and a sign and trade for Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu from the Orlando Magic on July 9, 2009. It was a four-way deal sending Jerry Stackhouse (who was bought out and released immediately) and substantial cash from Dallas to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Dallas Mavericks received Shawn Marion and Kris Humphries along with Nathan Jawai from the Toronto Raptors, and the Orlando Magic got a trade exception.\n\n\nOn December 31, 2010, he signed with the Chinese team Jiangsu Dragons.\n\nOn August 9, 2011, he signed a one-year contract with the Spanish team Club Baloncesto Estudiantes.\n\nOn April 26, 2012, Wright signed with Guaiqueries de Margarita of the LPB of Venezuela.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Wright signed with the upcoming AmeriLeague to play on the following season. However, the league folded after it was discovered the founder was a con-artist.\n\nOn February 20, 2016, Wright was announced by the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters to be the team's new import for the 2016 PBA Commissioner's Cup, replacing an injured Wayne Chism.

More simply, the shape resonance total energy is more than the separated fragment energy.\nPractical implications of this difference for lifetimes and spectral widths are mentioned in works such as Zobel.\n\nRelated terms include a special kind of shape resonance, the core-excited shape resonance, and trap-induced shape resonance.\n\nOf course in one-dimensional systems, resonances are shape resonances. In a system with more than one degree of freedom, this definition makes sense only if the separable model, which supposes the two groups of degrees of freedom uncoupled, is a meaningful approximation. When the coupling becomes large, the situation is much less clear.\n\nIn the case of atomic and molecular electronic structure problems, it is well known that the self-consistent field (SCF) approximation is relevant at least as a starting point of more elaborate methods. The Slater determinants built from SCF orbitals (atomic or molecular orbitals) are shape resonances if only one electronic transition is required to emit one electron.\n\nToday, there is some debate about the definition and even existence of the shape resonance in some systems observed with molecular spectroscopy. It has been experimentally observed in the anionic yields from photofragmentation of small molecules to provide details of internal structure.\n\nIn nuclear physics the concept of \"Shape Resonance\" is described by Amos de Shalit and Herman Feshbach in their book.\n\n\"It is well known that the scattering from a potential shows characteristics peaks, as a function of energy, for such values of E that make the integral number of wave lengths sit within the potential. The resulting shape resonances are rather broad, their width being of the order of ...\"\n\nThe shape resonances were observed around the years 1949\u201354 in nuclear scattering experiments. They indicate broad asymmetric peaks in the scattering cross section of neutrons or protons scattered by nuclei. The name \"shape resonance\" has been introduced to describe the fact that the resonance in the potential scattering for the particle of energy E is controlled by the shape of the nucleus. In fact the shape resonance occurs where the integral number of wavelengths of the particle sit within the potential of the nucleus of radius R. Therefore, the measure of the energies of the shape resonances in the neutron-nucleus scattering have been used in the years from 1947 to 1954 to measure the radii R of the nuclei with the precision of \u00b11\u00d710\u00a0cm as it can be seen in the chapter \"Elastic Cross Sections\" of \"A Textbook in Nuclear Physics\" by R. D. Evans.\n\nThe \"shape resonances\" are discussed in general introductory academic courses of quantum mechanics in the frame of potential scattering phenomena.\n\nThe shape resonances arise from the quantum interference between closed and an open scattering channels. At the resonance energy a quasi bound state is degenerate with a continuum. This quantum interference in many body system has been described using quantum mechanics by Gregor Wentzel, for the interpretation of the Auger effect, by Ettore Majorana for the dissociation processes and quasi bound states, by Ugo Fano for the atomic auto-ionization states in the continuum of helium atomic spectrum and by Victor Frederick Weisskopf. J. M. Blatt and Herman Feshbach for nuclear scattering experiments.\n\nThe shape resonances are related with the existence of nearly stable bound states (that is, resonances) of two objects that dramatically influences how those two objects interact when their total energy is near that of the bound state. When the total energy of the objects is close to the energy of the resonance they interact strongly, and their scattering cross-section becomes very large.\n\nA particular type of \"shape resonance\" occurs in multiband or two-band superconducting heterostructures at atomic limit called superstripes due to quantum interference of a first pairing channel in a first wide band and a second pairing channel in a second band where the chemical potential is tuned near a Lifshitz transition at the band edge or at the topological electronic transitions of the Fermi surface type \"neck-collapsing\" or \"neck-disrupting\"\n\n"}, {"id": "2166584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166584", "title": "Tony Trischka", "text": "Anthony Cattel Trischka (born January 16, 1949) is an American five-string banjo player.\n\nA native of Syracuse, New York, Trischka's interest in banjo was sparked by the Kingston Trio's version of \"Charlie and the MTA\" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, he made his recording debut on \"15 Bluegrass Instrumentals\" with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of America's premier sports-rock band Country Granola. In 1973, he began a three-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, \"Bluegrass Light\" and \"Heartlands\".

In July 2009 he launched the groundbreaking \"Online Banjo School with Tony Trischka\", an interactive, online learning school that teaches students around the world how to play banjo with ArtistWorks. Trischka is closely associated with \"newgrass,\" which features several innovations to traditional bluegrass, including jazzy arrangements, non-traditional chordal structures, and frequent covers of non-bluegrass songs. Trischka is one of the major innovators of the \"chromatic\" banjo style, which features sinewy, snaky melodic runs not strictly played out of chord positions.\n\n2011 saw \"Give Me the Banjo\" aired on PBS stations nationwide with Trischka as the musical director and co-producer of the documentary. It was released on DVD. He produced Steve Martin's Grammy-nominated \"Rare Bird Alert\" (Rounder), which features performances by Paul McCartney, the Dixie Chicks and the Steep Canyon Rangers.\n\nIn December 2012, Trischka was awarded the United States Artists Friends Fellow in recognition of the excellence of his work.\n\n\nWith the Big Dogs\n\nWith Psychograss\n\nWith Skyline\n\nWith the Wayfaring Strangers\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166589", "title": "9M17 Fleyta", "text": "The AT-2 \"Swatter\" is the NATO reporting name for the 3M11 \"Fleyta\" (flute) MCLOS radio command anti-tank missile of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe missile was developed by the Nudelman OKB-16 design bureau. It was developed at about the same time as the AT-1 Snapper as a heavy ATGM for use on both ground launchers and helicopters. It addressed some of the problems of the AT-1; it was much faster, and had slightly longer range. These improvements were achieved by sending commands via a radio link instead of a trailing guidance wire, which allowed the missile to travel faster. However, it did make it vulnerable to jamming. The missile system was shown to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in September 1964, and accepted for service shortly afterwards.\n\nThe AT-2 was the first Soviet ATGM to be deployed from helicopters. Small numbers were fitted to the Mi-4AV. The missile was deployed on the Mi-8 Hip as well as the Mi-24 and Mi-25 'Hind' series of helicopters. It was also deployed on the BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nThe original AT-2A (3M11 \"Falanga\") missile was problematic; one Russian source describes the missile as \"notable for its complexity and low reliability\". Also, the missile's range was felt to be inadequate. An improved version of the missile was developed: the AT-2B (9M17 \"Skorpion\"). Externally, the missiles are very similar, however the AT-2B range is increased to 3.5\u00a0km. The standard production version was the 9M17M \"Skorpion-M\", which entered service in 1968.\n\nThe next development was to integrate SACLOS guidance, resulting in the AT-2 \"Swatter-C\" or 9M17P \"Skorpion-P\". It entered service in 1969. A product improved version the 9M17MP was developed that had an improved engine and signal lamp.\n\nThe missile has been used extensively in the following wars on the Mi-24 platform.\n\nIt was replaced in Soviet service by the 9K114 Shturm ATGM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166590", "title": "Tom Frame (letterer)", "text": "Tom Frame (1931 \u2013 14 July 2006) was a British comics letterer.

Bordeaux is centered on the city of Bordeaux, on the Garonne River. To the north of the city the Dordogne River joins the Garonne forming the broad estuary called the Gironde and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (sometimes called \"claret\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines (Cr\u00e9mant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \"ch\u00e2teaux\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine.\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-1st century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.\n\nIn the 12th century, the popularity of Bordeaux wines in England increased dramatically following the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The marriage made the province of Aquitaine part of the Angevin Empire, and thenceforth the wine of Bordeaux was exported to England. At this time, Graves was the principal wine region of Bordeaux, and the principal style was clairet. This accounts for the ubiquity of \"claret\" in England, though this is now used to refer to all red wine rather than the clairet style specifically. The export of Bordeaux was interrupted by the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between France and England in 1337. By the end of the conflict in 1453 France had repossessed the province, thus taking control of wine production in the region. As part of the Auld Alliance, the French granted Scottish \nmerchants a privileged position in the trade of claret\u2014a position that continued largely unchanged after the Treaty of Edinburgh ended the military alliance between France and Scotland. Even when the by then Protestant kingdoms of England and Scotland, both ruled by the same Stuart king by this point, were trying to militarily aid the Huguenot rebels in their fight against Catholic France in La Rochelle, Scots trading vessels were not only permitted to enter the Gironde, but the French navy escorted them safely to the port of Bordeaux to protect them from Huguenot privateers.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Dutch traders drained the swampy ground of the M\u00e9doc so it could be planted with vines, and this gradually surpassed Graves as the most prestigious region of Bordeaux. Malbec was the dominant grape here, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nIn 1855, the ch\u00e2teaux of Bordeaux were classified; this classification remains widely used today. From 1875 to 1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by phylloxera infestations. The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.\n\nThe major reason for the success of winemaking in the Bordeaux region is an excellent environment for growing vines. The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigate the land and provide an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region. Bordeaux lies at the center of the confluence of the Dordogne and Garonne Rivers, which flow into the Gironde.\n\nThese rivers define the main geographical subdivisions of the region:\n\nIn Bordeaux the concept of \"terroir\" plays a pivotal role in wine production with the top estates aiming to make \"terroir\" driven wines that reflect the place they are from, often from grapes collected from a single vineyard. The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well-drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde river. An old adage in Bordeaux is the best estates can \"see the river\" from their vineyards. The majority of land facing riverward is occupied by classified estates.\n\nRed Bordeaux is generally made from a blend of grapes. Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and rarely Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re. Today Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re is rarely used, with Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, being one of the few to still retain Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re vines. As of July 2019, Bordeaux wineries authorized the use of four new red grapes to combat temperature increases in Bordeaux. These newly approved grapes are Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa.\n\nAs a very broad generalisation, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines produced in the M\u00e9doc and the rest of the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Ch\u00e2teaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. This is typically referred to as the \"Bordeaux Blend\". Merlot tends to predominate in Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top-quality Ch\u00e2teaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nWhite Bordeaux is predominantly, and exclusively in the case of the sweet Sauternes, made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. Typical blends are 80% S\u00e9millon and 20% Sauvignon blanc. As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of S\u00e9millon and a smaller proportion of Sauvignon blanc. Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac. Recently permitted by Bordeaux wineries, three new white grapes have been added. These grapes are Alvarinho, Petit Manseng, and Liliorila.\n\nIn the late 1960s S\u00e9millon was the most planted grape in Bordeaux. Since then it has been in constant decline although it still is the most common of Bordeaux's white grapes. Sauvignon blanc's popularity on the other hand has been rising, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white Bordeaux grape in the late 1980s and now being grown in an area more than half the size of that of the lower yielding S\u00e9millon.\n\nWineries all over the world aspire to making wines in a Bordeaux style. In 1988, a group of American vintners formed The Meritage Association to identify wines made in this way. Although most Meritage wines come from California, there are members of the Meritage Association in 18 states and five other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Mexico.\n\nThe red grapes in the Bordeaux vineyard are Merlot (62% by area), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and a small amount of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re (1% in total). The white grapes are S\u00e9millon (54% by area), Sauvignon blanc (36%), Muscadelle (7%) and a small amount of Ugni blanc, Colombard and Folle blanche (3% in total). Because of the generally humid Bordeaux climate, a variety of pests can cause a problem for the \"vigneron\". In the past, this was counteracted by the widespread use of pesticides, although the use of natural methods has recently been gaining in popularity. The vines are generally trained in either single or double guyot. Hand-picking is preferred by most of the prestigious ch\u00e2teaux, but machine-harvesting is popular in other places.\n\nFollowing harvest, the grapes are usually sorted and destemmed before crushing. Crushing was traditionally done by foot, but mechanical crushing is now almost universally used. Chaptalization is permitted, and is fairly common-place. Fermentation then takes place, usually in temperature controlled stainless steel vats. Next the must is pressed and transferred to barriques (in most cases) for a period of ageing (commonly a year). The traditional Bordeaux barrique is a 225-litre oak barrel. At some point between pressing and bottling the wine is blended. This is an integral part of the Bordeaux wine making process, as scarcely any Bordeaux wines are varietals; wine from different grape varieties is mixed together, depending on the vintage conditions, so as to produce a wine in the ch\u00e2teau's preferred style. In addition to mixing wine from different grape varieties, wine from different parts of the vineyard is often aged separately, and then blended into either the main or the second wine (or sold off wholesale) according to the judgment of the winemaker. The wine is then bottled and usually undergoes a further period of ageing before it is released for sale.\n\nThe Bordeaux wine region is divided into subregions including Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol, M\u00e9doc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness:\n\n\nThe vast majority of Bordeaux wine is red, with red wine production outnumbering white wine production six to one.\n\nThere are four different classifications of Bordeaux, covering different parts of the region:\n\nThe 1855 classification system was made at the request of Emperor Napoleon III for the Exposition Universelle de Paris. This came to be known as the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, which ranked the wines into five categories according to price. The first growth red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), are among the most expensive wines in the world.\nThe first growths are:\n\nAt the same time, the sweet white wines of Sauternes and Barsac were classified into three categories, with only Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem being classified as a superior first growth.\n\nIn 1955, St. \u00c9milion AOC were classified into three categories, the highest being \"Premier Grand Cru Class\u00e9 A\" with two members:\n\nIn the 2012 classification, two more Ch\u00e2teaux became members:\n\nThere is no official classification applied to Pomerol. However some Pomerol wines, notably Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus and Ch\u00e2teau Le Pin, are often considered as being equivalent to the first growths of the 1855 classification, and often sell for even higher prices.\n\nBordeaux wine labels generally include:\n\n\n\"Claret\" ( ) is a name primarily used in British English for red Bordeaux wine.\n\n\"Claret\" derives from the French \"clairet\", a now uncommon dark ros\u00e9, which was the most common wine exported from Bordeaux until the 18th century. The name was anglicised to \"claret\" as a result of its widespread consumption in England during the period in the 12th\u201315th centuries that Aquitaine was part of the Angevin Empire and continued to be controlled by Kings of England for some time after the Angevins. It is a protected name within the European Union, describing a red Bordeaux wine, accepted after the British wine trade demonstrated over 300 years' usage of the term.\n\n\"Claret\" is occasionally used in the United States as a semi-generic label for red wine in the style of the Bordeaux, ideally from the same grapes as are permitted in Bordeaux. The French themselves do not use the term, except for export purposes.\n\nThe meaning of \"claret\" has changed over time to refer to a dry, dark red Bordeaux. It has remained a term associated with the English upper class, and consequently appears on bottles of generic red Bordeaux in an effort to raise their status in the market.\n\nIn November 2011, the president of the Union des Maisons de N\u00e9goce de Bordeaux, announced an intention to use the term claret de Bordeaux for wines that are \"light and fruity, easy to drink, in the same style as the original claret when it was prized by the English in former centuries\".\n\nIn Britain and Australia, \"claret\" has also been a slang term for blood.\n\nMany of the top Bordeaux wines are primarily sold as futures contracts, called selling \"en primeur\". Because of the combination of longevity, fairly large production, and an established reputation, Bordeaux wines tend to be the most common wines at wine auctions.\n\nMarket reports released in February 2009 showed that the market had increased in buying power by 128% while the prices had been lowered for the very best Bordeaux wines.\n\nSyndicate des Vins de Bordeaux et Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur is an organization representing the economic interests of 6,700 wine producers in Bordeaux, France. The wine lake and other economic problems have increased the salience of the winemakers' association, whose members are facing increasing costs and decreasing demand for their product.\n\nAs the largest appellation producing fine wines, and the strong foundation of the pyramid of Bordeaux wines, Bordeaux AOC & Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOC today account for 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.\n\nPlan Bordeaux was an initiative introduced in 2005 by ONIVINS, the French vintners association, designed to reduce France's wine production in order to improve profitability for the remaining producers. Part of the plan was to uproot 17,000 hectares of the 124,000 hectares of vineyards in Bordeaux. The wine industry in Bordeaux has been experiencing economic problems in the face of strong international competition from New World wines and declining wine consumption in France.\n\nIn 2004, exports to the U.S. plummeted 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from Australia than from France. Amongst the possible causes for this economic crisis are that many consumers tend to prefer wine labels that state the variety of grape used, and often find the required French AOC labels difficult to understand.\n\nChristian Delpeuch, president emeritus of Plan Bordeaux hoped to reduce production, improve quality, and sell more wine in the United States. However, two years after the beginning of the program, Mr Delpeuch resigned, \"citing the failure of the French government to address properly the wine crisis in Bordeaux.\" Delpeuch told journalists assembled at the Bordeaux Press Club \"I refuse to countenance this continual putting off of decisions which can only end in failure.\" \"Delpeuch said he was shocked and disappointed by the failure of his efforts\u2014and by the lack of co-operation from winemakers and n\u00e9gociants themselves\u2014to achieve anything concrete in terms of reforms to the Bordeaux wine industry over the last 24 months.\" The future of Plan Bordeaux is uncertain.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166607", "title": "Hunter R.

He also served as Cornell's interim president in 2005\u20132006 and again from 2016\u20132017. Currently, Rawlings is Professor and University President Emeritus at the Department of Classics.\n\nRawlings served as President of the Association of American Universities from June 1, 2011, until April 2016. He has served as chair of both the Association of American Universities and the Ivy Council of Presidents. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he serves on the boards of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Haverford College, and the National Academy Foundation.\n\nOriginally from Norfolk, Virginia, Rawlings received his B.A. with honors in classics from Haverford College in 1966. From there he moved to Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in classics in 1970. After graduating from Princeton, he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder, rising to full professor in 1980. Rawlings began his career in academic administration at Colorado, serving as chairman of the classics department and later as associate vice chancellor for instruction. In 1988, Rawlings was named president of the University of Iowa, a position he held until 1995. Rawlings is married to Elizabeth T. Rawlings (n\u00e9e Trapnell), who is a professional translator with a master's degree in French from the University of North Carolina and a Master of Fine Arts degree in Literary Translation from the University of Iowa. She has translated and collaborated in translating a number of books from French to English, particularly in the fields of Greek and Latin literature and ancient history. The Rawlingses have four children and five grandchildren.. His eldest daughter, also Elizabeth, works for the Department of Homeland Security and his eldest son, Hunter Rawlings IV is \"New York Times\" Bestselling author and a former U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance officer. \n\nRawlings came to Cornell University, becoming its 10th president, serving from 1995 until 2003. At Cornell, he was an effective fundraiser, presiding over several large capital campaigns. Rawlings created several new positions and programs to support undergraduate education, began the construction of several new dormitories, centralized the location of freshmen on campus (initially protested by Al Sharpton and others due to alleged racial implications), and promoted stronger undergraduate admissions standards. Rawlings began initiatives in certain areas of science and engineering that he considered especially important to the future (such as bioinformatics, computational biology, computer and information sciences, genomics, and materials science), and began plans for Weill Hall, a large new life sciences building which houses the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology. He encouraged interdisciplinary exchanges in the humanities and social sciences. He also presided over an agreement to establish a branch of Cornell's medical school in Qatar, the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.\n\nWhile President of Cornell, Rawlings also held the rank of professor of classics, and continued to hold this position after he left the presidency. Notably, during the last two years of his presidency, he taught an undergraduate course in classics. At the same time, Rawlings faced criticism from many students and alumni leaders for his hands-off approach toward the student body and his focus on the business operations of Cornell.\n\nAfter the sudden resignation of his successor as president, Jeffrey Lehman, effective June 30, 2005, Rawlings agreed to reassume the presidency on an interim basis until a permanent replacement could be found. On January 21, 2006, David J. Skorton was announced as the next president of Cornell. Skorton took office on July 1. (Like Rawlings, Skorton was previously President of the University of Iowa.)\n\nAfter the sudden passing of Skorton's successor, President Elizabeth Garrett, in March 2016, Rawlings was appointed interim president. He began on April 25, 2016.\n\nRawlings' research focuses on Greek history and historiography. His scholarly publications include a book, \"The Structure of Thucydides' History\" (Princeton University Press, 1981).\n\n"}, {"id": "2166631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166631", "title": "Matsudaira Sadanobu", "text": "Sadanobu was born in Edo Castle on January 15, 1759, into the Tayasu branch of the Tokugawa house. The Tayasu was one of the \"gosanky\u014d\", the senior-most of the lesser cadet branches of the Sh\u014dgun's family, which still bore the name Tokugawa (instead of the greater cadet branches which had the Matsudaira surname).\n\nHis father was Tayasu Munetake, the son of the reform-minded eighth sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Yoshimune. The Tayasu house stood apart from the other cadet branches resident in Edo Castle, living a more austere lifestyle, following the example set by Yoshimune\u2014in Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit (\"masuraoburi\") as opposed to feminine spirit (\"taoyameburi\"). It also set itself apart from the other branches due to its history of thwarted political ambition\u2014the founder, Munetake, had hoped to become his father's heir but was passed over for Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige. As a result, Sadanobu was brought up from a very young age with the hopes of being placed as the next shogunal heir. His education was very thorough, being done along Confucian lines, and by his teens Sadanobu had already read and memorized much of the Confucian canon. As he matured, there was a further onus on Sadanobu for success as several members of the Tayasu house began to die young. Further attempts were made by the family to place Sadanobu as the next shogunal heir, but they were thwarted by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu, who was then in power as the chief r\u014dj\u016b.\n\nFollowing the last failed attempt at adoption by the sh\u014dgun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni, head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses (another Tokugawa cadet branch), which ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern Mutsu Province (with an assessment of 110,000 \"koku\"), succeeding to headship in late 1783 following his stepfather's protracted illness. He was immediately faced with his domain's economically disastrous position: of 110,000 \"koku\" that it was supposed to be able to produce, 108,600 had been reported \"lost\". Sadanobu worked ceaselessly to fix the economic situation in Shirakawa, finally saving it and bringing its finances and agriculture back to stability. These reforms, coupled with Sadanobu's continued political maneuvering, brought him fame, and he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787, and regent to the 11th sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ienari early the following year.\n\nThis period of Sadanobu's strengthening of the already faltering Tokugawa regime is known as the Kansei Reforms. His policies could as well be construed as a reactionary response to the excesses of his predecessor under Sh\u014dgun Ieharu. He recovered the finances of the Shogunate to some extent, and had some success in rescuing its reputation. However, following the Title Incident and the visit of Adam Laxman, Sadanobu's credibility and popularity in the Tokugawa bureaucracy became overtaxed, and true to the suggestion in his autobiography that \"one should retire before discontent sets in\", he resigned.\n\nAside from his political reforms, Sadanobu was also known as a writer and a moralist, working under the pen name \"Raku\u014d\" (\u697d\u7fc1). Some of his notable texts include \"Uge no Hitokoto\", \"T\u014dzen Manpitsu\", \"Kanko-d\u014dri\", \"Kagetsutei Nikki\", \"Seigo\", and \"\u014cmu no Kotoba\", among others. Some time after his death, it was discovered that he had written a satirical text parodying \"daimy\u014d\" life, titled \"Daimy\u014d Katagi\". Scholars have since been somewhat taken aback by this discovery, since the text falls into the category of \"gesaku\", which Sadanobu officially opposed.\n\nThough Sadanobu resigned from his position on the senior council, he continued to keep up with political affairs, especially keeping in close touch with Matsudaira Nobuaki (his successor in the senior council), as well as the rector of the Shogunate's college, Hayashi Jussai, whom he had personally installed in that position. During these last few years of his rule in Shirakawa, he was also involved in matters of national defense, taking up security duties on the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula in 1810 together with Matsudaira Katahiro of Aizu. In domainal matters, Sadanobu continued to devote himself to the reforms he had established, as well as to education. He retired from the family headship in 1819, and was succeeded by his son Sadanaga. Sadanobu died in 1829, and according to his will, his son petitioned the Yoshida family in Kyoto to grant him the deified title of \"Shukoku-daimy\u014djin\". This was granted in three stages, in 1833, 1834, and 1855.

Banister resigned from the IRS and later appeared on the television program \"60 Minutes II\" challenging the conduct of the IRS concerning legal issues with taxation. Banister's books, such as \"Investigating The Federal Income Tax: A Report To The American People\", and other material, challenge the legality of some aspects of the income tax.\n\nIn 2004, Banister was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and various counts of willfully aiding, assisting counseling and procuring the filing of a false amended income tax return in connection with his alleged assistance of a client, Walter Allen Thompson. Thompson owned and operated Cencal, an aviation and flight bag manufacturing business. Cencal employed a number of hourly wage workers who were predominantly seamstresses, production workers and office workers. In July 2000, Thompson removed all of the employees from the taxpayer rolls by no longer withholding employment taxes from wages and salaries, by not filing Forms 941, and by not providing employees or the IRS with annual wage or other income statements, Forms W-2 or 1099.\n\nThompson was charged numerous tax-related offenses. On January 28, 2005, he was found guilty of two counts of knowingly filing false claims against the United States under , ten counts of willful failure to collect and turn over taxes under , and one count of willfully filing a false income tax return under . Thompson was acquitted on one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States under . Thompson was sentenced to serve 72 months in prison and was fined $7,500. The case against Banister continued, and Banister was eventually acquitted of the charges against him.\n\nBanister's license as a Certified Public Accountant was revoked by the California Board of Accountancy, effective March 7, 2007.\n\nThe web site for the California Board of Accountancy notes that in December 2003, the U.S. Department of the Treasury ordered Banister disbarred from practice before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and that the disbarment was finalized in June 2004. The California Board of Accountancy also states:\n\nThe revocation of Banister's California CPA license was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of California.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service was investigating Joseph Banister \"to determine whether Banister promotes abusive tax schemes that would subject him to penalties under or subject him to injunction under ,\" and issued a summons to an attorney named Robert Bernhoft in connection with the investigation.\n\nOn August 27, 2008, the United States Tax Court ruled that Banister was liable for federal income taxes and penalties for failure to file his 2002 federal income tax return and report, as income, $23,000 in a distribution from a retirement plan and other income. Banister appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals ruled against him.\n\nIn a later case, the Internal Revenue Service determined that for tax years 2003 through 2006, Banister had tax deficiencies of $179,786.00, plus section 6651(a)(2) penalties for failure to timely pay of $44,946.50, plus section 6651(f) penalties for fraudulent failure to file of $130,344.86, plus penalties of $6,022.84 for failure to timely pay installments of estimated income tax. In that case, the Tax Court ruled that Banister was liable for a penalty of $25,000 under Internal Revenue Code section 6673(a)(1), for engaging in frivolous litigation. Banister appealed, but the decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on November 21, 2016. The Court of Appeals added a penalty of $8,000 against Banister (under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure) for filing a frivolous appeal. Banister then filed a petition U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court denied his request in October 2017.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166648", "title": "Coin orientation", "text": "Coin orientation (or coin alignment or variations of these) is the relation of the vertical orientation of the images on the obverse and reverse sides of coins to one another.

Wieringerwaard was formerly a separate municipality, until it merged with Barsingerhorn in 1970.\n\nIn 2001, the village of Wieringerwaard had 1176 inhabitants. The built-up area of the village was 0.32\u00a0km\u00b2, and contained 502 residences.\nThe statistical area \"Wieringerwaard\", which also can include the peripheral parts of the village, as well as the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 1500.\n\nThe polder was laid dry in 1610. It border, and also the border of the municipality, were the Zuiderzee, the dike-ditches along the outside of the Westfriese Omringdijk and the Slikkerdijk of the Zijpe. In 1970, Wieringerwaard became part of the municipality of Barsingerhorn, but in 1990 it was separated from this municipality and added to the municipality of Anna Paulowna.\n\nThe area was already inhabited before 1610. In the two centuries before the All Saints' Flood of 1170 there were already Frisians in the area, later called West Frisians. After the many storms which raged around the 12th century the area became uninhabitable. After the area was drained in 1610 it became populated again. In the northern part of the area settlements slowly formed. Eventually, a ribbon shaped village formed between the 1621 lock in the Slikkerdijk and the ditch named De Kolk. This village was named after the polder. After a new lock was constructed on the other side of De Kolk, at the Pishoek and the Waardkanaal, a settlement center arose there. This center was named Nieuwesluis.\n\nIn 1742, on top of the Noorderdijk, a windmill was built. The settlement center which arose there was named De Molens, and five other windmills appeared around the same time and ensured the draining of the polder. More houses appeared around these mills than in the ribbon shaped village. With the construction of the church in 1812, that tendency became stronger, and \"Wieringerwaard\" meant the village round the mills, and the placename De Molens disappeared. In 1949, the lock in the Slikkerdijk, which had already been renewed twice, was demolished, which was a reason for the village not to be extended in that direction.\n\nAs well as het Witte Kerkje there are more curiosities in Wieringerwaard, such as many monumental farms. The windmill named De Hoop, which was built in 1742 and which was converted to a corn mill in 1972, is open for visitors every Saturday, weekday only on appointment. Wieringerwaard also has a water tower.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of May the flower days are held. Flower mosaics made of hyacinths are to be seen in the village on these days.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166658", "title": "Hemothorax", "text": "A hemothorax (derived from hemo- [blood] + thorax [chest], plural \"hemothoraces\") is an accumulation of blood within the pleural cavity. The symptoms of a hemothorax include chest pain and difficulty breathing, while the clinical signs include reduced breath sounds on the affected side and a rapid heart rate. Hemothoraces are usually caused by an injury but may occur spontaneously: due to cancer invading the pleural cavity, as a result of a blood clotting disorder, as an unusual manifestation of endometriosis, in response to a collapsed lung, or rarely in association with other conditions.\n\nHemothoraces are usually diagnosed using a chest X-ray, but can be identified using other forms of imaging including ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI scan. They can be differentiated from other forms of fluid within the pleural cavity by analysing a sample of the fluid, and are defined as having a hematocrit of greater than 50% that of the person's blood. Hemothoraces may be treated by draining the blood using a chest tube, but may require surgery if the bleeding continues. If treated, the prognosis is usually good. Complications of a hemothorax include infection within the pleural cavity and the formation of scar tissue.\n\nThe symptoms of a hemothorax depend on the quantity of blood that has been lost into the pleural cavity. A small hemothorax usually causes little in the way of symptoms, while larger hemothoraces commonly cause breathlessness and chest pain, and occasionally lightheadedness. Other symptoms may occur in association with a hemothorax depending on the underlying cause.\n\nThe clinical signs of a hemothorax include reduced or absent breath sounds and reduced movement of the chest wall on the affected side. When the affected side is tapped or percussed, a dull sound may be heard in contrast to the usual resonant note. Large hemothoraces that interfere with the ability to transfer oxygen may cause a blue tinge to the lips (cyanosis). In these cases the body may try to compensate for the loss of blood, leading to a rapid heart rate (tachycardia), and pale, cool, clammy skin.\n\nA hemothorax is often caused by an injury, either blunt trauma or wounds that penetrate the chest, and these cases are referred to traumatic hemothoraces. Even relatively minor chest injuries can lead to significant hemothoraces. Injuries often cause the rupture of small blood vessels such as those found between the ribs. However, if larger blood vessels such as the aorta are damaged, the blood loss can be massive.\n\nHemothorax can also occur as a complication of heart and lung surgery, for example the rupture of lung arteries caused by the placement of catheters.\n\nLess frequently, hemothoraces may occur spontaneously. A hemothorax can complicate some forms of cancer if the tumour invades the pleural space. Tumours responsible for hemothoraces include angiosarcomas, schwannomas, mesothelioma, and lung cancer. Hemothoraces are more likely to occur in response to very minor trauma when blood is less able to form clots, either as result of medications such as anticoagulants, or because of bleeding disorders such as haemophilia. Rarely, hemothoraces can arise due to endometriosis, a condition in which tissue that normally covers the inside of the uterus forms in unusual locations. Endometrial tissue that implants on the pleural surface can bleed in response to the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle, causing what is known as a catamenial hemothorax as part of the thoracic endometriosis syndrome. It represents 14% of cases of thoracic endometriosis syndrome.\n\nThose with an abnormal accumulation of air within the pleural space (a pneumothorax) can bleed into the cavity, which occurs in about 5% of cases of spontaneous pneumothorax. The resulting combination of air and blood within the pleural space is known as a hemopneumothorax.\n\nRarely, hemothoraces can occur following spontaneous tearing of blood vessels such as in an aortic dissection, although bleeding in these circumstances is usually into the pericardial space. Spontaneous tearing of blood vessels is more likely to occur in those with disorders that weaken blood vessels such as some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or in those with malformed blood vessels as is seen in Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome. Other rare causes of hemothorax include neurofibromatosis type 1 and extramedullary haematopoiesis.\n\nThe thoracic cavity is a chamber within the chest, containing the lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. Thin sheets of tissue known as the pleural membranes or pleura line the chest and cover the lungs - the chest wall is lined by the parietal pleura, while the visceral pleura covers the outside of the lungs. The visceral and parietal pleura are normally separated by only a thin layer of fluid, forming the pleural cavity.\n\nWhen a hemothorax occurs, blood enters the pleural cavity. The blood loss has several effects. Firstly, as blood builds up within the pleural cavity, it begins to interfere with the normal movement of the lungs, preventing one or both lungs from fully expanding and thereby interfering with the normal transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the blood. Secondly, blood that has been lost into the pleural cavity can no longer be circulated. Hemothoraces can lead to very significant blood loss - each half of the thorax can hold more than 1500 milliliters of blood, representing more than 25% of an average adult's total blood volume. The body may struggle to cope with this blood loss, and in order to compensate tries to maintain blood pressure by forcing the heart to pump harder and faster, and by squeezing or constricting small blood vessels in the arms and legs. These compensatory mechanisms can be recognised by a rapid resting heart rate and cool fingers and toes.\n\nIf the blood within the pleural cavity is not removed, it will eventually clot. This clot tends to stick the parietal and visceral pleura together and has the potential to lead to scarring within the pleura, which if extensive leads to the condition known as a fibrothorax. Following the initial loss of blood, a small hemothorax may irritate the pleura, causing additional fluid to seep out, leading to a bloodstained pleural effusion. Furthermore, as enzymes in the pleural fluid begin to break down the clot, the protein concentration of the pleural fluid increases. As a result, the osmotic pressure of the pleural cavity increases, causing fluid to leak into the pleural cavity from the surrounding tissues.\n\nHemothoraces are most commonly detected using a chest X-ray, although ultrasound is sometimes used in an emergency setting. However, plain X-rays may miss smaller hemothoraces while other imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging may be more sensitive. In cases where the nature of an effusion is in doubt, a sample of fluid can be aspirated and analysed in a procedure called thoracentesis.\n\nA chest X-ray is the most common technique used to diagnosis a hemothorax. X-rays should ideally be taken in an upright position (an erect chest X-ray), but may be performed with the person lying on their back (supine) if an erect chest X-ray is not feasible. On an erect chest X-ray, a hemothorax is suggested by blunting of the costophrenic angle or partial or complete opacification of the affected half of the thorax. On a supine film the blood tends to layer in the pleural space, but can be appreciated as a haziness of one half of the thorax relative to the other.\n\nA small hemothorax may be missed on a chest X-ray as several hundred milliliters of blood can be hidden by the diaphragm and abdominal viscera on an erect film. Supine X-rays are even less sensitive and as much as one liter of blood can be missed on a supine film.\n\nUltrasonography may also be used to detect hemothorax and other pleural effusions. This technique is of particular use in the critical care and trauma settings as it provides rapid, reliable results at the bedside. Ultrasound is more sensitive than chest x-ray in detecting hemothorax.\n\nComputed tomography (CT or CAT) scans may be useful for diagnosing retained hemothorax as this form of imaging can detect much smaller amounts of fluid than a plain chest X-ray. However, CT is less used as a primary means of diagnosis within the trauma setting, as these scans require a critically ill person to be transported to a scanner, are slower, and require the subject to remain supine.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to differentiate between a hemothorax and other forms of pleural effusion, and can suggest how long the hemothorax has been present for. Fresh blood can be seen as a fluid with low T1 but high T2 signals, while blood that has been present for more than a few hours displays both low T1 and T2 signals. MRI is used infrequently in the trauma setting due to the prolonged time required to perform an MRI, and the deterioration in image quality that occurs with motion.\n\nAlthough imaging techniques can demonstrate that fluid is present within the pleural space, it may be unclear what this fluid represents. To establish the nature of the fluid, a sample can be removed by inserting a needle into the pleural cavity in a procedure known as a thoracentesis or pleural tap. In this context, the most important assessment of the pleural fluid is the percentage by volume that is taken up by red blood cells (the hematocrit), which can be estimated by dividing the red blood cell count of the pleural fluid by 100,000. A hemothorax is defined as having a hematocrit of at least 50% of that found in the affected person's blood, although the hematocrit of a chronic hemothorax may be between 25 and 50% if additional fluid has been secreted by the pleura. Thoracentesis is the test most commonly used to diagnose a hemothorax in animals.\n\nThe management of a hemothorax depends largely on the extent of bleeding. While small haemothoraces may require little in the way of treatment, larger hemothoraces may require fluid resuscitation to replace the blood that has been lost, drainage of the blood within the pleural space using a procedure known as a tube thoracostomy, and potentially surgery in the form of a thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to prevent further bleeding. Additional treatment options include antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection and fibrinolytic therapy to break down clotted blood within the pleural space.\n\nBlood in the cavity can be removed by inserting a drain (chest tube) in a procedure called a tube thoracostomy. This procedure is indicated for most causes of haemothorax, but should be avoided in aortic rupture which should be managed with immediate surgery. The thoracostomy tube is usually placed between the ribs in the sixth or seventh intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. It is important to avoid a chest tube becoming obstructed by clotted blood as obstruction prevents adequate drainage of the pleural space. Clotting occurs as the clotting cascade is activated when the blood leaves the blood vessels and comes into contact with the pleural surface, injured lung or chest wall, or the thoracostomy tube. Inadequate drainage may lead to a retained hemothorax, increasing the risk of infection within the pleural space (empyema) or the formation of scar tissue (fibrothorax). Thoracostomy tubes with a diameter of 24\u201336 F (large-bore tubes) should be used, as these reduce the risk of blood clots obstructing the tube. Manual manipulation of chest tubes (also referred to as milking, stripping, or tapping) is commonly performed to maintain an open tube, but no conclusive evidence has demonstrated that this improves drainage. If a chest tube does become obstructed, the tube can be cleared using open or closed techniques. Tubes should be removed as soon as drainage has stopped, as prolonged tube placement increases the risk of empyema.\n\n10\u201320% of traumatic hemothoraces require surgical management. Larger hemothoraces, or those that continue to bleed following drainage may require surgery. This surgery may take the form of a traditional open-chest procedure (a thoracotomy), but may be performed using video-associated thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). While there is no universally accepted cutoff for the volume of blood loss required before surgery is indicated, generally accepted indications include more than 1500 mL of blood drained from a thoracostomy, more than 200 mL of blood drained per hour, hemodynamic instability, or the need for repeat blood transfusions. VATS is less invasive and cheaper than an open thoracotomy, and can reduce the length of hospital stay, but a thoracotomy may be preferred when hypovolaemic shock is present. The procedure should ideally be performed within 72 hours of the injury as delay may increase the risk of complications. In clotted hemothorax, VATS is the gold standard procedure to remove the clot, and is indicated if the hemothorax fills 1/3 or more of a hemithorax. The ideal time to remove a clot using VATS is at 48\u201396 hours, but can be attempted up to nine days after the injury.\n\nResuscitation with intravenous fluids or with blood products may be required. In fulminant cases, transfusions may be administered before admission to the hospital. Clotting abnormalities, such as those caused by anticoagulant medications, should be reversed. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given for 24 hours in the case of trauma.\n\nBlood clots may be retained within the pleural cavity despite chest tube drainage. Such retained clots should be removed, preferably with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). If VATS is unavailable, an alternative is fibrinolytic therapy such as streptokinase or urokinase given directly into the pleural space seven to ten days after the injury. Residual clot that does not dissipate in response to fibrinolytics may require surgical removal in the form of decortication.\n\nThe prognosis following a hemothorax depends on its size, the treatment given, and the underlying cause. While small hemothoraces may cause little in the way of problems, in severe cases an untreated hemothorax may be rapidly fatal due to uncontrolled blood loss. If left untreated, the accumulation of blood may put pressure on the mediastinum and the trachea, limiting the heart's ability to fill. However, if treated, the prognosis following a traumatic hemothorax is usually favourable and dependent on other injuries that have been sustained at the same time. Hemothoraces caused by benign conditions such as endometriosis have a good prognosis, while those caused by neurofibromatosis type 1 has a 36% rate of death, and those caused by aortic rupture are often fatal.\n\nComplications can occur following a hemothorax, and are more likely to occur if the blood has not been adequately drained from the pleural cavity. Blood that remains within the pleural space can become infected, and is known as an empyema. The retained blood can also irritate the pleura, causing scar tissue to form. If extensive, this scar tissue can encase the lung, restricting movement of the chest wall, and is then referred to as a fibrothorax. Other potential complications include atelectasis, lung infection, intrathoracic hematoma, wound infection, pneumothorax, or sepsis.\n\nThere are about 300,000 cases of hemothorax in the U.S every year. Polytrauma (injury to multiple body systems) involves chest injuries in 60% of cases and commonly leads to hemothorax. About 37% of people hospitalized for blunt chest trauma have traumatic hemothorax.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166684", "title": "Abingdon School", "text": "Abingdon School is a day and boarding independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England. The twentieth oldest independent British school, it celebrated its 750th anniversary in 2006.\n\nThe date of Abingdon's foundation is unclear. Some believe the school to have been founded prior to the 12th century by the Benedictine monks of Abingdon Abbey, with a legal document of 1100 listing Richard the Pedagogue as the first headmaster. From its early years, the school used a room in St Nicolas' Church, which itself was built between 1121 and 1184.\n\nThe school now takes its anniversary from the earliest surviving reference to the school \u2013 1256 \u2013 a charter of Abingdon Abbey recording an endowment by Abbot John de Blosneville for the support of thirteen poor scholars. In the past though, the school considered itself as having been founded by John Roysse in 1563. This led to the unusual circumstance whereby the school celebrated its 400th anniversary in 1963 (at which Princess Margaret was guest of honour), and then its 750th in 2006 (at which Princess Anne was guest of honour). The focus on 1256 facilitated extensive fundraising in 2006.\n\nBy the time of de Blosneville's endowment in 1256, the school had moved to a couple of rooms in Stert Street with a house for boarders at 3 Stert Street under the charge of a Dionysia Mundy. With John Roysse's re-endowment of 1563, the school moved to a site south of the Abbey gateway. Roysse was a prosperous mercer in the City of London, and through this association the school has received substantial benefactions from the Worshipful Company of Mercers. The name \"Roysse's School\" was used until the 1960s and many older Abingdon residents still use the term.\n\nAfter the dissolution of Abingdon Abbey in 1538, the school passed through a difficult phase: the sixteenth century endowments by Old Abingdonians attempted to overcome the loss of monastic support. Thomas Tesdale, who had been a pupil in 1563, made provision for an Usher to teach six poor scholars from the Borough of Abingdon and offered support for thirteen Abingdon students to study at Oxford. This benefaction eventually developed into Pembroke College in 1624 by the re-foundation of Broadgates Hall.\n\nThe six poor scholars, known as Bennett Boys, or colloquially as the Gown Boys owing to their dress, were financed by another Old Abingdonian, William Bennett. Between 1609 and 1870 the school maintained a dual management: the Headmaster, appointed by the Mayor and Corporation, and the Tesdale Usher and Bennett Scholars appointed by the Master and Governors of Christ's Hospital, Abingdon. Despite being penalised during and after the English Civil War for its royalist and Anglican tendencies the school survived and achieved somewhat of a revival under headmaster Robert Jennings (1657\u20131683). In 1671, ten boys were expelled after they refused to attend Anglican services at St Helen's church.\nThe school experienced a successful period during the 18th century under headmaster Thomas Woods (1716\u20131753), known as \"Flogging Tom\". The school became favoured among the local aristocracy and many OAs went on to successful careers. In 1743, The Old Abingdonian Club was inaugurated, it is consequently one of the oldest such organisations in the UK.\n\nAt the turn of the century, the school entered a period of decline under the leadership of the \"incompetent\" headmaster Dr. John Lempriere. As a consequence, Pembroke College, Oxford, used the Oxford University Act 1854 as an excuse to cut its links with the school.\n\nThe current school site in the Victorian quarter of Abingdon, adjacent to Albert Park, was designed by Edwin Dolby and was built from 1870. Its architecture was described in \"The Builder\" that year as externally \"of a simple character, the local material of red brick and tile being the chief material employed, relieved by bands of Bath stone\". Extensions to the 1870 buildings were added in 1880. In 1901, a chapel and gymnasium were built. The adjacent Waste Court property was acquired in 1928. The Science School came in 1952. In 1963, to mark the Quartercentenary of the school's re-foundation, the big schoolroom was re-ordered as the Grundy Library (opened by Princess Margaret), together with erection of further buildings east of the Science Wing, the whole becoming known as Big School. In 1980, the Amey Theatre and Arts' Centre was opened and the Sports Centre opened in 1984. Mercers Court was opened in 1994 by the Chancellor of Oxford University and Visitor of Pembroke College, Baron Jenkins of Hillhead.\n\nIn 1998, it merged with Josca's, a preparatory school four miles to the west at Frilford which since 2007 has been known as Abingdon Preparatory School, with both schools becoming part of the Abingdon Foundation. There are strong connections with the nearby School of St Helen and St Katharine in Abingdon. In 2003, the new Arts Department was opened (adjacent to the Amey Theatre).\n\nOn 4 October 2008, the newly completed Sports Centre was opened by MP Kate Hoey. This multimillion-pound project took 5 years to complete and has increased the floorspace of the school by 40% Plans for the complex were formally launched by Princess Anne in 2006.\n\nIn September 2010, Felicity Lusk, formerly headmistress of Oxford High School for Girls, a GDST school, replaced Mark Turner as Head of Abingdon. She became the first female Head of a boys' boarding public school. A recent addition to the School's facilities is a new Yang Science Centre by Hopkins Architects. Opened in October 2015, housing 21 laboratories, study areas and prep rooms. The previous science building was refurbished in 2016 with new rooms for history, geography and classics and new sports facilities were installed at Tilsley Park. In 2016, Lusk was replaced by Michael Windsor.\n\nIn 2018, a new development called Beech Court was completed and opened in November. It houses a new library, Sixth Form Centre, and art facilities. One year later in 2019 work started on a further development on Faringdon Lodge. \n\nThe \"Good Schools Guide\" called it \"an impressive school which does what it sets out to do well\", also noting that it was \"likely to increase in popularity because of its location and increasingly sparkly achievements\", while \"The Times\" described it as \"an elite boys' boarding school\".\n\nThe school currently has about 1,040 pupils aged 11\u201318, of whom 135 are boarders. The school is split into 10 houses, one of which is for boys in years 7 & 8 (Lower School, around 135 boys), three of which are for boarders and dayboys in year 9 and above, and six for day boys in year 9 and above. With the exception of Lower School, School House, Austin House and Crescent House, the houses are named after their current Housemasters and are thus prone to change. Boys in Lower School have a pastoral tutor within the house for two years before being redistributed to the 9 \"senior\" houses when they move into year 9 and are joined by c.100 boys from other schools. In years 9 to 13 (3rd year to Upper 6th), they have the same housemaster, but usually three different pastoral tutors, specialising in 3rd year, the GCSE years and then the Sixth Form years, Though this is subject to the particular house and change, with many boy having fewer tutors throughout their time at the school.\n\nThe school offers over 130 extracurricular activities, known as the \"Other Half\" (of the syllabus).\n\nAbingdon has a strong sporting tradition, especially in rowing, rugby union and cricket. In recent years the school has reached the later stages of the Daily Mail U18 rugby cup whilst also gaining places in the last four of the HMC national 20/20 cricket competition. Sport is compulsory at Abingdon School and each student must do at least two sessions per week.\n\nThe boat club has a long history with documentary evidence indicating rowing was a school activity in 1830. Roysse's School Rowing Club (1840) became the Abingdon School Boat Club.\nThe Debating Society is the school's oldest non-sporting society, founded in 1904. It debates a variety of motions in its weekly meetings, from the humorous to the serious, with many being political in nature. Abingdon takes part in a variety of national debating, public speaking and model United Nations competitions, often achieving notable success, as in 2009 when a group of Abingdon boys were national champions of the 2009 European Youth Parliament competition. The society also holds black-tie dinner debates with girls' schools, including the School of St Helen and St Katharine, Wycombe Abbey and Westonbirt School.\n\nThe school produces ten publications including the 130 year-old Abingdonian. The School's Edmund and Roysse Societies hold talks for boys several times a term, inviting eminent speakers to lecture on a wide variety of subjects.\n\nAbingdon has a Combined Cadet Force, which consists of RAF and Army sections. Although membership of the CCF is voluntary at Abingdon, it remains a large and popular activity recently becoming the schools largest non sporting other half. The CCF has achieved several successes with cadets in the contingent's Royal Air Force section winning the 2002 Ground Training Competition (South East) at RAF Uxbridge, Middlesex. The shooting team went on to become the top team at the National final that same year. In 2016 a member of the RAF section went on to win the Sir John Thomson Memorial Sword and the De Havilland Medal. As Well as this in 2018 a member of the army section went on to be selected as the lords lieutenant's cadet for oxfordshire. The CCF has been ranked as one of the top 3 CCF's in the country. Every year the CCF holds their own charity event independent of the school as well as weekends and field days away culminating in the annual Easter camp a week long trip in which cadets get to experience all aspects of military life. Abingdon CCF is one of two CCFs in the country to still hold its own individual camp.\n\nThe Abingdon Film Unit (AFU) exists as part of the \"Other Half\" and has created nearly 100 films since its creation in 2004. Notable successes include the screening of two films at the BFI Southbank. These were \"Gravel and Stones\", an emotional insight into the lives of various Cambodian landmine victims, and \"One Foot on the Ground\", a documentary following the life of an aspiring Moldovan, basketball player. Festival screenings for various other films include Raindance, the London International Documentary Festival, the Bradford Animation Festival, and the British Film Festival in Dinard, France. Awards include Best Documentary, Best Fiction and Best Animation at the Future Film Festival in London and the National Young Filmmaker's Award at the Leeds Student Film Festival. To date, the most decorated AFU production has been \"Blindside\": awards include the BFI Future Film Award, Student Filmmaking Awards (Finalist), Grigsby Film Award, Depth of Field International Film Festival Award, Future of Cinema Film Festival Award and Nashville Film Festival Award. The film's success led to considerable attention from local media.\n\nAbingdon is academically a strong school: the students regularly achieve excellent results and a significant number progress to the most prestigious universities, including around 20 to Cambridge and Oxford. At A Level, the 2017 A*-A percentage averaged 63.3% At GCSE, the A* percentage in 2017 was 60.2% and the A*-A percentage 86.3%.\n\nAt GCSE, most of the courses followed are at the iGCSE level (international GCSE) and all examinations are taken in year 11 (5th year), i.e. there is no \"early\" take of qualifications even for top sets. The top two Maths sets at GCSE follow the iGCSE and Additional Maths qualifications. In sixth form, A Levels are followed to AS and then A2 level, but following the reforms put in place under Michael Gove, the school has decided that, from September 2015, it will follow a linear system (i.e. courses will be completed over two years) and will not be offering the new stand-alone AS qualification. As a consequence of this freedom, some departments will be offering the Cambridge pre-U course instead of the traditional A Level.\n\nThe school holds a number of events, dinners and balls throughout the year.\n\nThe \"Foundation Dinner\", to honour the school's founders and benefactors, is held once a year towards the end of Lent term. It is normally attended by Abingdon Town Councillors, supporters of the school, governors, famous OAs, school prefects and upper sixth scholars.\n\nThe school also take part in an annual lacrosse match on St. Katherine's Day, between Abingdon 1st rugby team, and St. Helen's and St. Katherine's School.\n\nA notable school event is the \"Griffen Ball\" held at the end of the school year. It is often attended by members of the upper sixth who are leaving the school as well as other students and many parents and teachers. The ball itself is often preceded earlier in the day by the school's annual prize-giving ceremony.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166701", "title": "Zdenka", "text": "Zdenka or Zde\u0148ka () is a feminine given name in Czech, Slovak, and Slovenian, originally a short form of Zdeslava.

In 1993, an accountant advised Simkanin that a required change in the accounting method for the company would result in greater corporate income tax. Simkanin then began to question the validity of the federal income tax. On his 1994 and 1995 personal tax returns, he made notations to indicate that the returns were filed under protest, and he did not file personal returns for years 1996 through 2001.\n\nSimkanin told his accountant he was not required to file returns because he lived off his savings and had no income. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in affirming his conviction, stated that this assertion was false and that Simkanin had received a salary from his company. The Court also stated that Simkanin had received payments from Arrow for his personal expenses and that those payments were booked as \"repair and maintenance\".\n\nIn reviewing the case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stated:\n\nOn March 2, 2002, a photograph of Simkanin and four other people appeared in a full-page advertisement in \"USA Today\" which announced that he had not withheld income taxes from the paychecks of his company's employees because he believed the income tax to be voluntary. The advertisement also requested donations for the We the People Foundation.\n\nIn June 2003, Simkanin was arrested and arraigned on various tax charges\u00a0. On January 7, 2004, he was convicted by a United States federal court on ten counts of willfully failing to collect and pay over employment taxes under , fifteen counts of knowingly making and presenting false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for refund of employment taxes under and , and four counts of willfully failing to timely file federal income tax returns under . His convictions were upheld on appeal.\n\nSimkanin was sentenced to seven years in federal prison. After the sentencing, the \"Houston Chronicle\" reported: \"U.S. District Judge John McBryde said during the sentencing that Simkanin was 'entrenched' in a 'cultlike' anti-government group that 'holds nothing but contempt for the laws of the United States. McBryde ordered Simkanin to pay the government $302,076 in restitution.\" The \"Houston Chronicle\" also reported that a prosecutor indicated that Internal Revenue Service agents and prosecutors had given Simkanin \"repeated opportunities to reconsider his position and begin paying taxes\" before the government began criminal prosecution. Assistant United States Attorney David Jarvis was quoted as saying \"I guess he just figured we wouldn't do anything.\"\n\nSimkanin was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at Texarkana, Texas. He was released on June 18, 2010. However, on June 23, 2010, he was order jailed again, pending a hearing to be held on July 1, 2010, regarding alleged violations of his terms of release.\n\nOn July 2, 2010, his terms of release were revoked, and the Court sentenced him to an additional six years and seven months in prison. He was incarcerated at the Beaumont Low Federal Correctional Complex at Beaumont, Texas, and had been scheduled for release on March 18, 2016.\n\nWhile serving his sentence, Simkanin died on December 28, 2010, at the age of sixty-seven. \n"}, {"id": "2166718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166718", "title": "Malaysian Airline System Flight 653", "text": "Malaysian Airline System Flight 653 (MH653) was a scheduled domestic flight from Penang to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, operated by Malaysian Airline System (MAS). On the evening of 4 December 1977, the Boeing 737-200 aircraft flying the service crashed at Tanjung Kupang, Johor, Malaysia, while purportedly being diverted by hijackers to Singapore. It was the first fatal air crash for Malaysia Airlines (as the airline is now known), with all 93 passengers and 7 crew killed. The flight was apparently hijacked as soon as it reached cruise altitude. The circumstances in which the hijacking and subsequent crash occurred remain unsolved. The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Malaysia.\n\nThe aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-2H6 registered as It had been delivered new to MAS in September 1972 with registration \n\nFlight 653 departed from Runway 22 at Penang International Airport at exactly 19:21 for Kuala Lumpur's Subang Airport (now known as Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport).\n\nCaptain GK Ganjoor and First Officer Karamuzaman Jali were making landing preparations at 19:54, while at an altitude of over Batu Arang and descending toward Runway 33 at Subang Airport, when the crew reported to Subang Tower that an \"unidentified hijacker\" was on board, after someone knocked on the cockpit doors. Subsequently, the pilots were forced to cut off all communications by a group of hijackers who suddenly barged into the cockpit. The tower immediately notified the authorities, who made emergency preparations at the airport.\n\nA few minutes later, the crew radioed: \"We're now proceeding to Singapore. Good night.\" In the last few minutes of the tapes from the cockpit voice recorder, investigators heard conversation between the pilots and the hijackers about how the aircraft would run out of fuel before it could make it to Singapore, followed by a series of gunshots. They concluded that both the pilot and co-pilot were fatally shot by the hijacker, which left the plane \"professionally uncontrolled\". At 20:15, all communication with the aircraft was lost. At 20:36, the residents of Kampong Ladang, Tanjung Kupang in Johor reported hearing explosions and seeing burning wreckage in a swamp. The wreckage was later identified as the aircraft; it had hit the ground at a near-vertical angle at a very high speed. There were no survivors.\n\nThe full circumstances of the hijacking and crash were never solved. However, airport officials at Kuala Lumpur claimed pilots had radioed that members of the Japanese Red Army had hijacked the plane. In 1996, CNN reporters wrote that the hijackers were in fact identified as Red Army members, but this has not been confirmed. All recovered remains were x-rayed in an attempt to discover evidence of a projectile or weapon, but no such evidence was ever found. The remains of the victims were interred in a mass burial.\n\nAfter the incident, the Aviation Security Unit of the Airport Standard Division of the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia was established.\n\nPassengers included the Malaysian Agricultural Minister, Dato' Ali Haji Ahmad; Public Works Department Head, Dato' Mahfuz Khalid; and Cuban Ambassador to Japan, Mario Garc\u00eda Inch\u00e1ustegui.\n"}, {"id": "2166725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166725", "title": "Potentilla alchemilloides", "text": "Potentilla alchemilloides, the alchemilla-leaved cinquefoil, is a species of cinquefoil (genus \"Potentilla\") native to the Pyrenees. \n\nIt is an upright herbaceous perennial plant reaching 30\u00a0cm tall, with palmate leaves with 5-7 leaflets.

It is situated on the southern shore of Carlingford Lough with Slieve Foy as a backdrop, sometimes known as Carlingford Mountain, It is the main town on the Cooley Peninsula. Located on the R176/R173 roads between Greenore and Omeath village, Carlingford is approximately 27\u00a0km north east (by road) from Dundalk (15.6\u00a0km directly), 90\u00a0km north of Dublin and 11\u00a0km south of the border with Northern Ireland. Carlingford won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1988.\n\nCarlingford still retains its medieval layout noticeable by the narrow lanes and small streets. Tholsel Street is where the last of the medieval walled town's gates can still be seen, called \"The Tholsel\" which apparently was also used as a gaol, on Tholsel Street itself there is still a 16th-century Town House known as the Carlingford Mint.\n\nCarlingford was occupied in the 12th century by Norman knight Hugh de Lacy after laying the foundation stone for a castle on a strategic outcrop of rock. A settlement sprang up close to this fortress. The castle is known by the name of King John's Castle following a visit in the year 1210. The castle is an extensive ruin seated on a solid rock - the sides of which are enclosed by the sea. Mountains rise on the inland side, at the foot of which is a narrow pass which was formerly commanded by the fortress.\n\nCarlingford's strategic position on the east coast of Ireland (along with Carrickfergus and Drogheda) made it an important trading port. This trade led to its relative prosperity during the 14th, 15th and early 16th centuries. Carlingford's early prosperity faltered when, in 1388, the town was burnt to the ground, by a Scots force under the command of Sir William Douglas of Nithsdale. This was a punitive raid, following Irish attacks on Galloway, the Lord of which was Nithsdale's father, Archibald the Grim.\n\nCarlingford received five charters in total; the first in 1326 by Edward II and the last in 1619 under James I. The increased trade encouraged a mercantile class to build in the area, the results of which can be seen today in the remains of the Mint and Taffe's Castle.\n\nIn 1637, the Surveyor General of Customs issued a report compiled from accounts of customs due from each port and their \"subsidiary creeks\". Of the Ulster ports on the list, Carrickfergus was first, followed by Bangor, Donaghadee, and Strangford. Carlingford and Coleraine each had \u00a3244 customs due and had equal ranking.\n\nCarlingford was regarded for its green finned oysters, which remained its main employment source, alongside herring fishing. The oysters were renowned throughout Britain and Europe while also gaining responses when mentioned in related texts.\n\nThe 1641 Rising by the Irish of Ulster, the Cromwellian Conquest of 1649, and the subsequent Williamite wars of the 1690s all took their toll on the local economy. As recorded in the Journal of Isaac Butler, Carlingford the town was in a \"state of ruin\" by 1744. However, the final nail in the coffin was the desertion to open water of the prosperous herring shoals that occupied the lough by the early 18th century.\n\nCarlingford's inability to develop a heavy industry allowed its mediaeval layout and archaeological artefacts to remain relatively intact. The area was opened up to tourism in the 1870s by the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore railway, which passed through Carlingford. This line closed in 1951. These transport links led to tourism being a key source of employment. Fishing was also important economically; particularly oysters and crabs from the nearby harbour. The town hosts the annual Carlingford Oyster Festival usually held in August. A passenger ferry operates daily out of the village of Omeath, away, during the summer months.\n\nOn the day of the 1918 Irish general election, the Camlough Company of the Irish Volunteers travelled by train from Newry to Carlingford. On arrival, they found large numbers of Carlingford inhabitants wearing Union Jacks. The Volunteers ordered all the Royal Irish Constabulary men they saw on duty on the streets or at the polling booths to return to their barracks and to remain in them whilst the Volunteers were in Carlingford. A series of attacks were made on the Volunteers from by mobs on the streets. The Volunteers took control and sought to protect voters going to record their votes until the polling booths closed. Seamus Lyang from Dundalk was polling clerk in Carlingford and when the booths closed the Volunteers had to take Lyang under their protection and escort him out of the Carlingford. All the pubs and shops in Carlingford were hostile to the Volunteers and refused to serve them. After the closing of the poll, the Volunteers marched back to Camlough.\n\nThe Irish singer-songwriter Tommy Makem wrote a melancholy song about the town, \"Farewell to Carlingford\", covered by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem and The Dubliners. In the Dublin Penny Journal they advised that in AD 432 St Patrick's second landing in Ireland was according to some authorities effected here.\n\n\nCarlingford railway station opened on 1 August 1876, but finally closed on 1 January 1952 when the Dundalk, Newry & Greenore Railway ceased operations. In 1948 the film 'Saints and Sinners' used various locations around Carlingford including a scene at the beginning at the station of a DN&GR train arriving.\n\nBus \u00c9ireann route 161 operates Monday to Saturday, providing seven journeys to Dundalk via Greenore and four journeys to Newry via Omeath. This service does not operate on Sundays or Bank Holidays.\n\nOn Sundays, Local Link Louth Meath Fingal route 701, operated by Halpenny Travel, provides three journeys to Dundalk, and three journeys to Newry via Omeath.\n\nCarlingford also has a marina.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166734", "title": "Alexander Kovalevsky", "text": "Alexander Onufrievich Kovalevsky (, , 7 November 1840 in Vorkovo, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire \u2013 1901, St. Petersburg, Russian Empire), also written Alexander Kowalevsky, was a Russian embryologist of Polish descent, who studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg and became professor at the University of St Petersburg.\nHe was the brother of paleontologist Vladimir Kovalevsky, and the brother-in-law of the mathematician Sofya Kovalevskaya.\n\nKowalevsky showed that all animals go through a period of gastrulation.\n\nKovalevsky discovered that tunicates were not molluscs, but that their larval stage had a notochord and pharyngeal slits, like vertebrates. Further, these structures developed from the same germ layers in the embryo as the equivalent structures in vertebrates, so he argued that the tunicates should be grouped with the vertebrates as chordates. 19th century zoology thus converted embryology into an evolutionary science, connecting phylogeny with homologies between the germ layers of embryos, foreshadowing evolutionary developmental biology.\n"}, {"id": "2166742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166742", "title": "Richard Lewine", "text": "Richard Lewine (July 28, 1910 \u2013 May 19, 2005) was an American composer and songwriter on Broadway as well as television producer.\n\nBorn in New York City, Lewine attended Columbia College before beginning his career as a composer and songwriter.

It is a loose spinoff and sequel of the 1986 film of the same name. The series was produced by Gaumont Multimedia with the worldwide distribution rights owned by Bohbot Entertainment (now BKN International).\n\nThe series is set in the far future of the 27th century. The last living descendant of the original Highlander fights against the evil dictator Kortan.\n\nThe story unfolds on post-apocalyptic Earth, after a meteorite collision nearly wipes out all human civilization after setting off nuclear weapons. Following this catastrophe, Connor MacLeod (the protagonist of the original film) and the other Immortals forswear the Game of fighting each other until only one Immortal remains to win the Prize. Instead, the Immortals swear to preserve human knowledge and help humanity. They cast away their swords and call themselves \"Jettators\" (from the French \"jette\", \"thrown away\".)\n\nBut one Immortal, Kortan, refuses to swear the oath, he still seeks the Prize and now wishes to dominate the world. Connor challenges Kortan to a duel and is defeated and killed, as any Immortal who breaks the oath is destined to die. However, with Connor's death comes the prophecy of the rise of a new Immortal, unbound by the oath, who will defeat Kortan. Uncontested by the Jettators and nigh-unkillable by mortals, Kortan establishes an empire controlling most of the planet, which he rules from his fortress Mogonda.\n\nSeven hundred years later, a Highland youth named Quentin is killed trying to defend his clan, the Dundee, from Kortan's slavers. He is the prophesied Immortal and returns to life. His dying mother reveals his true identity to be Quentin MacLeod from clan MacLeod, \"The Last of the MacLeods\". Quentin meets the Jetattor Don Vincente Marino Ramirez, who becomes his mentor. Ramirez teaches Quentin about Immortals and his mission to confront Kortan, and trains him in combat.\n\nAccompanied by Ramirez, his adoptive sister Clyde, and their pet Gaul, Quentin seeks out the Jettators to gain their Quickening and their knowledge, not by beheading, but by a \"sharing\" as MacLeod and the Jettator grasp the same sword simultaneously (although the effects are sometimes just as destructive to the surrounding area). In the wake of a sharing the Jettator becomes mortal and often his or her sword shatters to signify this. With the wisdom of Ram\u00edrez and the Quickenings of the Jettators, Quentin may be able to destroy Kortan.\n\nDespite being redesigned to attract a younger audience, the show was surprisingly mature/violent; it was not uncommon for minor characters to die, and while Quentin took other Immortals' power and knowledge without also taking their lives, Kortan still did it the old way, by beheading them. In addition, though essentially a good-versus-evil scenario, most of the characters on both sides were more than just black and white heroes and villains. Many of Kortan's henchmen are shown to have good characteristics and feelings, and even on occasion Quentin will be tempted by greed and be selfish, especially when offered the chances of immense power. Of course, ultimately, his good side always wins through. Some episodes involve Jettators making use of a loophole in their oath to challenge Kortan regardless, such as Matsuda, who built a cyborg to fight Kortan in his stead, or Cornell, who changed his name to Orion to be able to fight Kortan.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral strange creatures exist in the universe of \"Highlander: The Animated Series\".\n\n\nA video game based on the series called \"\" was released for the Atari Jaguar CD.\n\nSome episodes of the series were edited into a feature-length film called \"Highlander: The Adventure Begins\" and was released by Family Home Entertainment in 1996.\n\nGenius Products released \"Highlander: The Animated Series\" on DVD in Region 1 on December 4, 2007.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166754", "title": "Semberija", "text": "Semberija (Cyrillic: , ) is a geographical region in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina.

She married an impoverished advocate, Patrick Cockburn of Ormiston in 1731. Unable to afford a home of their own they lived for 4 years in the house of her elderly father-in-law, \"an old Presbyterian of the deepest dye\" who condemned as ungodly cards, plays, and dancing. On the death of the old man they moved to Edinburgh, and she began to mix in society where her liveliness and wit made her welcome in spite of her relatively lowly status.\n\nIn 1745 during the Jacobite rising she vented her Whiggism in a squib upon Bonnie Prince Charlie, and narrowly escaped being taken by the Highland guard as she was driving through Edinburgh in the family coach of the Keiths of Ravelston, with the parody in her pocket.\n\nHer husband died on 29 April 1753, and left her a small income. She continued to mix in artistic and intellectual circles from her home in Bristo Street, on Castle-hill, Edinburgh. Despite the added loss of her only son in infancy we are told of, \"her insatiable love of mischief, mockery and match-making, everywhere welcome, both in town and country, a good companion, a wise friend, ready to jest over her own ailments.\"\n\nIn 1765 she published her lyrics to the traditional Border Ballad the \"Flowers of the Forest\" beginning \"I've seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling\". It is said to have been written before her marriage in 1731 and concerns a financial crisis that had ruined the fortunes of a number of the Selkirk Lairds. Later biographers, however, think it probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, with whom Alison appears to have had an early attachment. Another later set of lyrics to the song by Jean Elliot of Minto written in 1756 is also in circulation and should not be confused with Rutherford's.\n\nIn 1777 she remarked of a young Walter Scott that he was \"the most extraordinary genius of a boyo.\" She befriended Robert Burns in 1786, whom she described as having \"a most enthusiastic heart of love\". She was a great friend of the philosopher David Hume.\n\nShe was an indefatigable letter-writer and a composer of parodies, squibs, toasts and \"character sketches\", then a favourite form of composition. The \"Flowers of the Forest\" however is considered the only thing she wrote that possesses lasting literary merit.\n\nAt her house on Castlehill, and afterwards in Crichton Street, she received many illustrious friends, among whom were Henry Mackenzie, William Robertson, David Hume, John Home, Lord Monboddo, the Keiths of Ravelston, the Balcarres family and Lady Anne Barnard, the author of \"Auld Robin Gray.\" As a Rutherfurd she had a connexion with Sir Walter Scott's mother, and was her intimate friend. Lockhart quotes a letter written by Mrs Cockburn in 1777, describing the conduct of little Walter Scott, then scarcely six years old, during a visit which she paid to his mother, when the child gave as a reason for his liking for Mrs Cockburn that she was a \"virtuoso like himself.\"\n\nCockburn died on 22 November 1794.

His initiative in interviewing many largely forgotten, elderly film pioneers in the 1960s and 1970s preserved a legacy of early mass-entertainment cinema. He received an Academy Honorary Award at the 2nd Annual Governors Awards given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 13 November 2010. This was the first occasion on which an Academy Honorary Award was given to a film preservationist.\n\nBrownlow was born in Crowborough, Sussex, the only child of Thomas Brownlow, an Irish commercial artist making film posters for The Rank Organisation and Disney, and his wife Ninya (n\u00e9e Fortnum), also an artist, who was the daughter of a Governor of Trinidad and Tobago. He grew up in Finchley Road, north London. His first exposure to films came at prep school, where films rented from Wallace Heaton were screened. He attended Haileybury, where his contemporaries included John Howard Davies. He was rejected from national service due to short-sightedness. He began collecting silent films at the age of 11, and at age 15 he began apprenticing in the British film industry - he began as an office boy, and within five days was assigned as a trainee assistant editor, becoming an editor in 1958, working on a string of documentaries. Writing fan letters to silent film directors, he began to strike up a correspondence with figures from silent-era cinema.\n\nBrownlow's interest in the Second World War prompted the creation of his alternative-history film \"It Happened Here\", premised upon the Nazis having conquered Britain. Brownlow began work on the film at the age of 18 and soon began to collaborate with a 16-year-old friend, Andrew Mollo. After eight years of struggle, during which the film's content changed dramatically, it was completed in 1964 with the last-minute aid of Tony Richardson. The film was widely seen in the UK at film festivals, and it was picked up for major distribution by United Artists (UA). There were negative reactions in the media to parts of the film, complaints from some Jewish groups, and in October 1965 UA's American president, Arthur B. Krim, said the film would not see theatrical release unless the offending parts were cut out. Brownlow and Mollo tried to convince UA to run the film complete, but they were outmanoeuvred. The film finally began its theatrical run in May 1966, minus the disputed scenes. It was seen in London, New York, Copenhagen, Paris, Stockholm, Los Angeles and Haifa, and was reviewed positively. After the run, UA reported to Brownlow and Mollo that all of the box-office receipts had been used to pay the advertising and distribution costs. The two filmmakers did not make any money from the film.\n\nIn 1968, Brownlow published a book, \"How It Happened Here\", which described the making of the film, and the reception it received. Not only does it explain how two teenage boys made a feature film, it also explores the provocative social issues raised by the film. Brownlow had allowed genuine British Fascists to play themselves in the film, which angered some Jewish organizations. The book contained almost 100 pictures, mostly stills from the film and an introduction by film critic and author David Robinson. A new edition was published by UKA Press in 2007.\n\nAfter this cinematic feat Mollo and Brownlow began another project, \"Winstanley\", about Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers' commune following the English Civil War. The duo spent several years trying to gain support and following a long and difficult shoot, the film was released in 1975. In 2009 UKA Press published \"Winstanley: Warts and All\", a making-of book. Brownlow had written it shortly after completing work on the film, but the manuscript sat on the shelf for 34 years before being published.\n\nBrownlow's first book on silent film, \"The Parade's Gone By...\", was published in 1968. The book features many interviews with the leading actors and directors of the silent era, and began his career as a film historian. He spent many years gaining support for the restoration of Abel Gance's French epic, \"Napol\u00e9on\" (1927), a then-mutilated film that used many novel cinematic techniques. Brownlow's championing of the film succeeded, and the restored version, with a new score by Carl Davis, was shown in London in 1980, and again in London in 2013 with the Philharmonia Orchestra. Gance lived to see the acclaim for his restored film. The San Francisco Silent Film Festival presented the complete 2000 restoration of the film, with Davis conducting his score, at the Paramount Theatre Oakland in March 2012.\n\nBrownlow also began a collaboration with David Gill, with whom he produced several documentaries on the silent era. The first was \"Hollywood\" (1980), a 13-part history of the silent era in Hollywood, produced by Thames Television. This was followed by \"Unknown Chaplin\" (1983) (Charlie Chaplin), \"\" (1987) (Buster Keaton), \"Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius\" (1989) (Harold Lloyd) and \"\" (1995), among others. They also restored and released many classic silent films through the Thames Silents series (later via Photoplay Productions) in the 1980s and 1990s, generally with new musical scores by Carl Davis. \"The Search for Charlie Chaplin\" (2005; new version: 2010, UKA Press), a making-of book for \"Unknown Chaplin\", was published in 2010.\n\nSince David Gill died in 1997, Brownlow has continued to produce documentaries and conduct film restoration with Patrick Stanbury. These include \"Lon Chaney, A Thousand Faces\" (2000), \"Garbo\", a documentary produced for Turner Classic Movies to mark the centenary of actress Greta Garbo's birth, and \"I Am King Kong\" (2005) about filmmaker Merian C. Cooper.\n\nIn August 2010, Brownlow received an Honorary Academy Award for his role in film and cinema history preservation.\n\nOn 13 November 2016, Brownlow was featured in an episode of \"The Film Programme\" entitled 'Napoleon and I', dedicated to Abel Gance's masterpiece, the 1927 film, Napol\u00e9on on BBC Radio 4, the UK network. It tells how Brownlow has spent 50 years of his life, piecing together the lost sequences into the latest restoration of the silent movie and about his meeting the dapper Gance, when still a schoolboy. On 9 August 2018, Brownlow again featured on \"The Film Programme\" on BBC Radio 4, where he discussed the making of and initial responses to \"It Happened Here\".\n\nIn April 2019, Brownlow was honored at the Turner Classic Movie Festival in Hollywood at a screening of \"It Happened Here\" at the Egyptian Theatre.\n\n\n\n\nInterviews and articles by Brownlow\n"}, {"id": "2166798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166798", "title": "Kau, Hawaii", "text": "Ka\u016b is the southernmost district of Hawaii County, Hawaii, located on the island of Hawaii.\n\nKa\u016b was one of the six original districts of ancient Hawaii on the island, known as \"moku\".\nIt includes the areas of South Point (Ka Lae), Hawaiian Ocean View Estates (HOVE), Hawaiian Ocean View Ranchos (HOVR), now together known as Ocean View, N\u012bnole, Wai\u014dhinu, Na\u0101lehu and P\u0101hala.\n\nThe district contains much of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, including the volcanoes K\u012blauea and Mauna Loa, and Punaluu Black Sand Beach, Papak\u014dlea (Green Sand) Beach and Kamilo Beach. \nTo the east of Ka\u016b is the Puna District, and to the west is the South Kona District.\n\nThe Sugar Cane Era: The Beginning.\nThe largest commerce in Ka'u was sugar and leading the industry during its prime was Hawaiian Agriculture Co and Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Co.\n\nHawaiian Agriculture Co was established in 1876 but did not start producing sugar cane until 1880. Locally, it was known as the Pahala Plantation but legally the corporation was filed as the Hawaiian Agricultural Co. The company employed many locals including immigrants from Philippines, Japan, Portugal, and others. Corporate housing projects were built to provide living quarters for staff and added to the community of Pahala. The founders were Peter C. Jones, Charles R. Bishop, J.D. Brewer, and H.A.P. Carter.\n\nThe Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Co was established in 1868 by Alexander Hutchinson and it was one of the oldest sugar companies on the Big Island. Shortly, the plantation was renamed Naalehu Sugar Plantation. In his honor, following Hutchinson's death in 1873, William G. Irwin and Claus Spreckels purchased the plantation and renamed it Hutchinson Sugar Plantation. The company purchased Hilea Sugar Plantation in 1890. In 1910, it was purchased by C. Brewer & Co. Just like its competitor, Hawaiian Agriculture Co, the company employed many locals including immigrants from Philippines, Japan, Portugal, and others. Corporate housing projects were built to provide living quarters for staff and added to the community of Na'alehu.\n\nThe Sugar Cane Era: The Conclusion.\nIn 1972, Hawaiian Agricultural Co. merged with Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Co. The merged companies were renamed Kau Sugar Co and was now the only sugar plantation in Ka'u. However, this unified industry was short lived. After twenty four years, the sugar cane era finally came to an end with the Ka'u Sugar Co closing operation in 1996.\n\nThe coffee industry has been low profile since the early 1900s. However, after the closure of the Ka'u Sugar co, interest in growing coffee has surged. Many of Ka'u Sugar co staff were given the option to acquire a land lease in five acre increments to engage in agriculture commerce. From the lease lots along with private owned lots, coffee were being grown. The most popular varietals that are grown in the area is Typica and Caturra. \n\nOver the years, the coffee industry has been growing in importance, with the Ka\u016b Coffee Festival held in P\u0101hala.\n\nThe southernmost point of any state in the United States is at Ka Lae Point in the Ka\u016b District. It is \"almost\" the southernmost point in the whole country except that, technically, the United States Territory of Palmyra Island, although not part of a state within the US, is an incorporated territory (an integral part of the country) according to the doctrine of \"incorporation\" defined in the Supreme Court's Insular Cases; therefore Palmyra's south point on Holei Island at 5\u00b052'15\" N latitude is officially the southernmost point in the United States of America, not Ka Lae Point.\n\nKau shares much in common with the district of Puna, Hawaii. Both districts are situated on active volcanoes and contains large sections of land that are in Lava Flow Hazard Zones 1 and 2. Additionally, new lava zones 11, 12, and 13 are being established to account for current flow activity to reduce redlining.\n"}, {"id": "2166801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166801", "title": "Empty domain", "text": "In first-order logic the empty domain is the empty set having no members. In traditional and classical logic domains are restrictedly non-empty in order that certain theorems be valid. Interpretations with an empty domain are shown to be a trivial case by a convention originating at least in 1927 with Bernays and Sch\u00f6nfinkel (though possibly earlier) but oft-attributed to Quine 1951. The convention is to assign any formula beginning with a universal quantifier the value \"truth\" while any formula beginning with an existential quantifier is assigned the value \"falsehood\". This follows from the idea that existentially quantified statements have existential import (i.e. they imply the existence of something) while universally quantified statements do not. This interpretation reportedly stems from George Boole in the late 19th century but this is debatable. In modern model theory, it follows immediately for the truth conditions for quantified sentences:\n\n\nIn other words, an existential quantification of the open formula \u03c6 is true in a model iff there is some element in the domain (of the model) that satisfies the formula; i.e. iff that element has the property denoted by the open formula. A universal quantification of an open formula \u03c6 is true in a model iff every element in the domain satisfies that formula. (Note that in the metalanguage, \"everything that is such that X is such that Y\" is interpreted as a universal generalization of the material conditional \"if anything is such that X then it is such that Y\". Also, the quantifiers are given their usual objectual readings, so that a positive existential statement has existential import, while a universal one does not.) An analogous case concerns the empty conjunction and the empty disjunction. The semantic clauses for, respectively, conjunctions and disjunctions are given by\n\n\nIt is easy to see that the empty conjunction is trivially true, and the empty disjunction trivially false.\n\nLogics whose theorems are valid in every, including the empty, domain were first considered by Jaskowski 1934, Mostowski 1951, Hailperin 1953, Quine 1954, Leonard 1956, and Hintikka 1959. While Quine called such logics \"inclusive\" logic they are now referred to as free logic.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166803", "title": "Class-D amplifier", "text": "A class-D amplifier or switching amplifier is an electronic amplifier in which the amplifying devices (transistors, usually MOSFETs) operate as electronic switches, and not as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. They operate by rapidly switching back and forth between the supply rails, being fed by a modulator using pulse width, pulse density, or related techniques to encode the audio input into a pulse train. The audio escapes through a simple low-pass filter into the loudspeaker. The high-frequency pulses are blocked. Since the pairs of output transistors are never conducting at the same time, there is no other path for current flow apart from the low-pass filter/loudspeaker. For this reason, efficiency can exceed 90%.\n\nThe first Class-D amplifier was invented by British scientist Alec Reeves in the 1950s and was first called by that name in 1955. The first commercial product was a kit module called the X-10 released by Sinclair Radionics in 1964. However, it had an output power of only 2.5 watts. The Sinclair X-20 in 1966 produced 20 watts, but suffered from the inconsistencies and limitations of the germanium-based BJT transistors available at the time. As a result, these early class-D amplifiers were impractical and unsuccessful. Practical class-D amplifiers were later enabled by the development of silicon-based MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) technology. In 1978, Sony introduced the TA-N88, the first class-D unit to employ power MOSFETs and a switched-mode power supply. There were subsequently rapid developments in VDMOS (vertical DMOS) technology between 1979 and 1985. The availability of low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs led to Class-D amplifiers becoming successful in the mid-1980s. The first class-D amplifier based integrated circuit was released by Tripath in 1996, and it saw widespread use.\n\nClass-D amplifiers work by generating a train of rectangular pulses of fixed amplitude but varying width and separation, or varying number per unit time, representing the amplitude variations of the analog audio input signal. It is also possible to synchronize the modulator clock with an incoming digital audio signal, thus removing the necessity to convert it to analog. The output of the modulator is then used to gate the output transistors on and off alternately. Great care is taken to ensure that the pair of transistors are never allowed to conduct together, as this would cause a short circuit between the supply rails through the transistors. Since the transistors are either fully \"on\" or fully \"off\", they spend very little time in the linear region, and dissipate very little power. This is the main reason for their high efficiency. A simple low-pass filter consisting of an inductor and a capacitor provides a path for the low frequencies of the audio signal, leaving the high-frequency pulses behind. In cost sensitive applications the output filter is sometimes omitted. The circuit then relies on the inductance of the loudspeaker to keep the HF component from heating up the voice coil.\n\nThe structure of a class-D power stage is somewhat comparable to that of a synchronously rectified buck converter (a type of non-isolated switched-mode power supply (SMPS)), but works backwards. Whereas buck converters usually function as voltage regulators, delivering a constant DC voltage into a variable load, and can only source current (one-quadrant operation), a class-D amplifier delivers a constantly changing voltage into a fixed load, where current and voltage can independently change sign (four-quadrant operation). A switching amplifier must not be confused with linear amplifiers that use an SMPS as their source of DC power. A switching amplifier may use any type of power supply (e.g., a car battery or an internal SMPS), but the defining characteristic is that the amplification process itself operates by switching. Unlike a SMPS, the amplifier has a much more critical job to do, to keep unwanted artifacts out of the output. Feedback is almost always used, for the same reasons as in traditional analog amplifiers, to reduce noise and distortion.\n\nTheoretical power efficiency of class-D amplifiers is 100%. That is to say, all of the power supplied to it is delivered to the load, none is turned to heat. This is because an ideal switch in its \u201con\u201d state would conduct all the current but have no voltage loss across it, hence no heat would be dissipated. And when it is off, it would have the full supply voltage across it but no leak current flowing through it, and again no heat would be dissipated. Real-world power MOSFETs are not ideal switches, but practical efficiencies well over 90% are common. By contrast, linear AB-class amplifiers are always operated with both current flowing through and voltage standing across the power devices. An ideal class-B amplifier has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 78%. Class A amplifiers (purely linear, with the devices always \"on\") have a theoretical maximum efficiency of 50% and some versions have efficiencies below 20%.\n\nThe term \"class\u00a0D\" is sometimes misunderstood as meaning a \"digital\" amplifier. While some class-D amplifiers may indeed be controlled by digital circuits or include digital signal processing devices, the power stage deals with voltage and current as a function of non-quantized time. The smallest amount of noise, timing uncertainty, voltage ripple or any other non-ideality immediately results in an irreversible change of the output signal. The same errors in a digital system will only lead to incorrect results when they become so large that a signal representing a digit is distorted beyond recognition. Up to that point, non-idealities have no impact on the transmitted signal. Generally, digital signals are quantized in both amplitude and wavelength, while analog signals are quantized in one (e.g. PWM) or (usually) neither quantity.\n\nThe 2-level waveform is derived using pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse density modulation (sometimes referred to as pulse frequency modulation), sliding mode control (more commonly called \"self-oscillating modulation\" in the trade.) or discrete-time forms of modulation such as delta-sigma modulation.\n\nThe most basic way of creating the PWM signal is to use a high speed comparator (\"C\" in the block-diagram above) that compares a high frequency triangular wave with the audio input. This generates a series of pulses of which the duty cycle is directly proportional with the instantaneous value of the audio signal. The comparator then drives a MOS gate driver which in turn drives a pair of high-power switches (usually MOSFETs). This produces an amplified replica of the comparator's PWM signal. The output filter removes the high-frequency switching components of the PWM signal and recovers the audio information that the speaker can use.\n\nDSP-based amplifiers which generate a PWM signal directly from a digital audio signal (e. g. SPDIF) either use a counter to time the pulse length or implement a digital equivalent of a triangle-based modulator. In either case, the time resolution afforded by practical clock frequencies is only a few hundredths of a switching period, which is not enough to ensure low noise. In effect, the pulse length gets quantized, resulting in quantization distortion. In both cases, negative feedback is applied inside the digital domain, forming a noise shaper which has lower noise in the audible frequency range.\n\nTwo significant design challenges for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and linear mode operation as short as possible. \"Dead time\" is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into cut-off mode and both are \"off\". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the output power supply through themselves in a condition known as \"shoot-through\". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between switching states as fast as possible to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in linear mode\u2014the state between cut-off mode and saturation mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow shoot-through and/or too much linear mode operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs. There are also problems with using PWM for the modulator; as the audio level approaches 100%, the pulse width can get so narrow as to challenge the ability of the driver circuit and the MOSFET to respond. These pulses can get down to just a few nanoseconds and can result in the above undesired conditions of shoot-through and/or linear mode. This is why other modulation techniques such as pulse density modulation can get closer to the theoretical 100% efficiency than PWM.\n\nThe switching power stage generates both high dV/dt and dI/dt, which give rise to radiated emission whenever any part of the circuit is large enough to act as an antenna. In practice, this means the connecting wires and cables will be the most efficient radiators so most effort should go into preventing high-frequency signals reaching those:\n\n\nClass-D amplifiers place an additional requirement on their power supply, namely that it be able to sink energy returning from the load. Reactive (capacitive or inductive) loads store energy during part of a cycle and release some of this energy back later. Linear amplifiers will dissipate this energy, class-D amplifiers return it to the power supply which should somehow be able to store it. In addition, half-bridge class D amplifiers transfer energy from one supply rail (e.g. the positive rail) to the other (e.g. the negative) depending on the sign of the output current. This happens regardless of whether the load is resistive or not. The supply should either have enough capacitive storage on both rails, or be able to transfer this energy back.\n\nThe active devices in a Class D amplifier need only act as controlled switches, and need not have particularly linear response to the control input. Bipolar transistors or field effect transistors are usually used. Vacuum tubes can be used as power switching devices in Class-D power audio amplifiers. \n\nThe actual output of the amplifier is not just dependent on the content of the modulated PWM signal. The power supply voltage directly amplitude-modulates the output voltage, dead time errors make the output impedance non-linear and the output filter has a strongly load-dependent frequency response. \nAn effective way to combat errors, regardless of their source, is negative feedback. A feedback loop including the output stage can be made using a simple integrator. To include the output filter, a PID controller is used, sometimes with additional integrating terms. The need to feed the actual output signal back into the modulator makes the direct generation of PWM from a SPDIF source unattractive. Mitigating the same issues in an amplifier without feedback requires addressing each separately at the source. Power supply modulation can be partially canceled by measuring the supply voltage to adjust signal gain before calculating the PWM and distortion can be reduced by switching faster. The output impedance cannot be controlled other than through feedback.\n\nThe major advantage of a class-D amplifier is that it can be more efficient than a linear amplifier, with less power dissipated as heat in the active devices. Given that large heat sinks are not required, Class-D amplifiers are much lighter weight than class A, B, or AB amplifiers, an important consideration with portable sound reinforcement system equipment and bass amplifiers. Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of class-D amplifiers. However, the term mostly applies to power amplifiers intended to reproduce audio signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166806", "title": "Siege of Ch\u014dk\u014d-ji", "text": "Shibata Katsuie, the commander entrusted with defending the temple, led his forces in sallying out of the temple to face the besiegers, succeeding in the end.\n"}, {"id": "2166810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166810", "title": "Ernest Lester Jones", "text": "Colonel Ernest Lester Jones (April 14, 1876 \u2013 April 9, 1929) was born in East Orange, New Jersey and was commissioned a hydrographic and geodetic engineer. In addition to extended study abroad, he held an A. B. degree and an honorary A. M. degree conferred by Princeton University.\n\nColonel Jones was for 14 years the directing head of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&GS) and in that capacity used his talent and energy to promote scientific work and investigation. Much of the increased activity and interest in hydrography, geodesy, seismology, and terrestrial magnetism may be traced directly to his influence.\n\nColonel Jones had a long and notable career. Early in his Washington experience, he achieved recognition through his leadership in the settling of the boundary dispute between the United States and Canada, concerning Alaska (See Alaska Boundary Dispute). He was appointed head of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1915. In addition to his work with that body, he was a member of a number of important government and scientific missions. He served as a delegate to the International Geographic Survey of 1928, at Cambridge, England, where he delivered an address that was translated into many languages and printed in periodicals all over the world.\n\nColonel Jones inaugurated the movement that eventually ended in the organization of the American Legion. He was its first post and first department commander and was also instrumental in the formation of the Legion abroad. Through his influence in its work, he secured positions for thousands of veterans of the World War I.\n\nColonel Jones was an enthusiastic member of the Society of American Military Engineers, and rendered valuable services both to the Washington post and to the national organization. He served as Vice-President of the Post in 1924, and as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Society in 1925, 1926, and 1928.\n\nErnest Lester Jones, the son of Charles Hopkins and Ida (Lester) Jones was born in East Orange, New Jersey on April 14, 1876, and was a descendant of \"Mayflower\" passenger William Brewster. He received his educational training at the High School in Orange, New Jersey and at Newark Academy. Later he matriculated to Princeton University in the Class 1898, from which institution he received the Bachelor of Arts Degree.\n\nOn September 28, 1897, he was married to Virginia Brent Fox, of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nFollowing the completion of his studies at Princeton University, Mr. Jones was engaged in research, secretarial work, and business for a number of years. Early in 1913 he entered the service of the United States Government. President Wilson having appointed him Deputy Commissioner of the United States Bureau of Fisheries. He remained in this position until April 14, 1915, when he became Superintendent (title changed to Director in 1919) of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, which position he held until his death.\n\nDuring his residence in Washington, D.C., Colonel Jones served in the District of Columbia Militia, from Private to Major. During a portion of 1918 and 1919 he was on furlough from the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel, U.S. Signal Corps. Later, he became Colonel, Division of Military Aeronautics, and served with the American forces in France in World War I. For exceptional services during the war period he was decorated by the King of Italy as Officer of the Order of S.S. Maurizio and Lazzaro, and Fatigue de Guerre (Italy); he was also an Officer of the Legion of Honor (France). Immediately following the cessation of the war, when men's minds everywhere were turned toward matters of rehabilitation, Colonel Jones was among the first to consider the welfare of those who had been at the battle front in Europe and thus it came about that he was the organizer of the first post of the American Legion (George Washington Post, Washington, D.C.), and also an organizer and\nincorporator of the National Legion.\n\nAs the efficient administrator of a Federal Bureau, Colonel Jones early came to see the need for better conditions and more adequate salaries for employees in the Federal Service, and his advocacy of their cause in bringing these urgent needs to the attention of the proper authorities had an important part in securing remedial legislation. The great improvement in the efficiency of the personnel of the Federal Service, as a result of this legislation, has amply justified the wisdom of his efforts.\n\nIt was a part of his philosophy of human affairs that the best work can be done only when men have the best tools and appliances for doing it and so it was among his basic endeavors while Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey that the Bureau's engineers be supplied with adequate ships and modern instruments and equipment. These things he achieved in a large measure, the good effects of which are reflected in a larger and better volume of work and a finer spirit of performance by the entire personnel, so that the Bureau now meets the purposes of its being with a growing satisfaction and increased efficiency.\n\nThroughout his administration of the Bureau, Colonel Jones exemplified high executive ability. He was outstanding in his loyalty to the work of the organization and to his associates and subordinates, and in turn he engendered in them such sentiments toward himself. He worked constantly for the improvement of the Service under his direction so that the public might thereby be better served. He was positive in responding personally to whatever seemed necessary to advance each class of work and always cooperated with those of his associates who were making progress. He spared himself no amount of effort and toil to attain the things he thought were right and needful to be done. He had a humane and sincere sympathy for all who requested his assistance. Although firm in his opinions, yet he was considerate of the views of others.

The station was designed by William Tite with the main building on the westbound platform, even though this is the side furthest from the town centre. The station was on an embankment on the west side of New Street and the goods yard with a small goods shed was on the south side beyond the station building. Further sidings were provided on the north side of the line opposite the main goods yard. Goods facilities were withdrawn on 8 May 1967.\n\nIn August 2009, a new footbridge was erected at Honiton Railway Station replacing an older footbridge. The location of the footbridge moved towards the Exeter end of the station.\n\nIt was announced in early December 2010 that Honiton Railway Station was to undergo a phase of several improvements. This phase of \u00a31.4 million improvements set out to provide the station with a brighter enlarged booking hall, new toilets and changing facilities; and also a retail unit. In addition, both platforms were fitted with accessible ramps along with a new waiting shelter to make it easier for all passengers to use the \nstation.\n\nThe project, funded by South West Trains, Devon County Council, Network Rail and the National Station Improvement Programme has made the station more accessible. As part of South West Trains\u2019 commitment to deliver greener travel, the station was also equipped with shelters, additional CCTV and 1000 new bicycle spaces.\n\nWork on the improvement scheme started in early December 2010 and the completed refurbishment was officially unveiled on Thursday 23 June 2011. To mark the completion, Andy Pitt, Managing Director for South West Trains along with Councillor Stuart Hughes from Devon County Council gathered at the station for a photo and unveiling.\n\nThere was, for a few years, a second station in Honiton. It was opened in September 1906 about half a mile from the town station to allow soldiers to reach a rifle range at Roundball Hill, south west of the town centre. It was never advertised in timetables and was demolished early in 1921.\n\nA signal box was built in 1875 at the Exeter end of the station on the south side of the line. This was replaced by a new building on 16 June 1957 which was on the opposite side of the tracks. On 11 June 1967 the line from to was reduced to a single track but a loop line was retained at Honiton to allow trains to pass midway on this section. The westbound platform was signalled to allow eastbound trains to use it when they are not crossing a train coming in the opposite direction. In December 2009 a new loop was installed at Axminster to break up the section towards Chard. One siding was retained to the west of the signal box, worked by a ground frame rather than from the signal box itself, however this has now also been lifted.\n\nAnother signal box was provided at Honiton Incline. This was situated on the north side of the line beyond the Honiton Tunnel. The line climbs from towards Honiton at 1 in 100 (1%) and then continues up to the tunnel mouth a slightly steeper gradients, it then drops at 1 in 80 (1.25%) down to the former .\n\nIn 2012 signalling for the Salisbury-Exeter line transferred to the new signalling centre at Basingstoke. Signals previously controlled by Gillingham, Templecombe, Yeovil Junction and Honiton boxes all now have the prefix SE.\n\nA modern station building stands on the main platform which is on the southern side of the line. A footbridge to the west of this links the northern platform which has a small waiting shelter. The signal box is at the Exeter end of this platform and the main station car park is situated behind this, however the 1957 signal box closed and was knocked down in late spring of 2012.

The film was nominated for 28 awards and won 21 of them, and is now considered a classic in Argentine film history.\n\nThe film opens at a convenience store early in the morning, the present time. Juan (Gast\u00f3n Pauls), a con artist, successfully scams the cashier, and later attempts the same scam again on the next shift. Marcos (Ricardo Dar\u00edn), who has been observing him, steps in pretending to be a police officer and takes Juan away. As soon as they are far enough, Marcos tells Juan he is not actually a cop but a fellow con man. Juan asks Marcos to show him the ropes, because his father, also a con man, is in jail and he needs to raise money quickly to bribe a judge to reduce his father's sentence from 10 years to 6 months.\n\nThen, a scheme seemingly falls into their laps: Sandler (Oscar Nu\u00f1ez), a former business associate of Marcos, needs his help to sell counterfeit copies he made of some rare stamps called \"The Nine Queens\". The potential mark is Gandolfo (Ignasi Abadal), a rich Spaniard who is facing deportation and desperate to smuggle his wealth out of the country. Gandolfo has no time to fully check if the stamps are authentic but he hires an expert (Leo Dyzen) to do a quick check and is satisfied. He offers $450,000 for the stamps, with the exchange agreed to take place that evening. In the intervening time, the stamp expert demands from Juan and Marcos a cut, as he knew the stamps were in fact forged. The fake stamps are then stolen out of Juan and Marcos' hands by thieves on motorcycles who, unaware of their value, toss them into a river.\n\nTo salvage the scheme, Marcos approaches Sandler's widowed sister Berta (Elsa Berenguer), the owner of the real stamps, who agrees to sell them for $250,000. Marcos can put up $200,000 and asks Juan to contribute the remaining $50,000. Juan expresses his suspicion that he is being conned since Marcos seems to need exactly the amount that Juan has saved up; but as the $50,000 is not enough to help his father, Juan reluctantly agrees. They buy the real stamps and go to Gandolfo's hotel, but he says he's changed his mind and will now only buy the stamps if he also gets to sleep with Marcos' sister Valeria (Leticia Br\u00e9dice), a hotel employee. Valeria's price is that Marcos must confess to their younger brother Federico (Tom\u00e1s Fonzi) how Marcos cheated him out of their family inheritance in Italy. Gandolfo pays for the stamps with a certified check. However, the bank crashes the next morning, making the check worthless.\n\nIt appears that Juan and Marcos are both ruined. In the final scene, Juan goes to a warehouse, where he greets the motorcycle thieves, Gandolfo, Sandler and his sister Berta, and Juan's fianc\u00e9e Valeria \u2014 revealing that the real con was to swindle Marcos out of $200,000 as revenge for all the times he cheated his family and his partners.\n\n\nThe main character of the film is trying to remember the tune of a Rita Pavone song throughout the film. The song, \"Il Ballo Del Mattone\", plays as the end credits run.\n\nThe film opened wide in Argentina on August 31, 2000. The film was screened at various film festivals, including: the Telluride Film Festival, United States; the Toronto International Film Festival, Canada; the \"Medell\u00edn de Pel\u00edcula\", Colombia; the Portland International Film Festival, United States; the Cognac Festival du Film Policier, France; the M\u00fcnchen Fantasy Filmfest, Germany; the Norwegian International Film Festival, Norway; and others.\n\nIn the United States it opened on a limited basis on April 19, 2002.\n\nThe film's screenplay was adapted in the 2004 film \"Criminal\". It was also used as a basis for three Indian films: the Bollywood film \"Bluffmaster!\" (2005), the Malayalam film \"\" (2009) and the Telugu film \"All the Best\" (2012).\n\n\"Nine Queens\" garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall 92% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating based on 93 reviews, with a rating average of 7.5 out of 10. The site's consensus is: \"Deliciously twist-filled, \"Nine Queens\" is a clever and satisfying crime caper.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0\u2013100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 80 based on 30 reviews, classified as a generally favorably reviewed film.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert liked the screenplay of the film, and wrote, \"And on and on, around and around, in an elegant and sly deadpan comedy. A plot, however clever, is only the clockwork; what matters is what kind of time a movie tells. \"Nine Queens\" is blessed with a gallery of well-drawn character roles, including the alcoholic mark and his two bodyguards; the avaricious widow who owns the 'nine queens' and her much younger bleached-blond boyfriend, and Valeria the sister, who opposes Marcos' seamy friends and life of crime but might be willing to sleep with Gandolfo if she can share in the spoils.\"\n\nThe \"San Francisco Chronicle\" film critic, Edward Guthmann, also reviewed the film positively and thought the actors performed quite well, writing, \"Fast-paced and unerringly surprising, \"Nine Queens\" is nicely performed by a large cast, particularly Dar\u00edn as a goateed, less-than-perfect hoodwinker. David Mamet plowed this con-the-con turf in \"Heist\", \"House of Games\" and \"The Spanish Prisoner\", but Bielinsky, in his directing debut, makes it seem sassy and reinvented.\"\n\nWins\n\n"}, {"id": "2166832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166832", "title": "DigiCube", "text": "DigiCube Co., Ltd.

In the 2010 Congressional races, the sources of campaign contributions broke down as follows: c/o 2k18\nPresidential election campaign funding per candidate 2016 presidential election main party candidates (Hundred million dollars):\n\nFederal law does not allow corporations and labor unions to donate money directly to candidates (\"hard money\") or national party committees. It also limits how much money (a) individuals and (b) organizations involved in political action may contribute to political campaigns, political parties, and other FEC-regulated organizations.\n\nTable footnotes\n\nOne consequence of the limitation upon personal contributions from any one individual is that campaigns seek out \"bundlers\"\u2014people who can gather contributions from many individuals in an organization or community and present the sum to the campaign. Campaigns often recognize these bundlers with honorary titles and, in some cases, exclusive events featuring the candidate.\n\nAlthough bundling existed in various forms since the enactment of the FECA, bundling became organized in a more structured way in the 2000s, spearheaded by the \"Bush Pioneers\" for George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns. During the 2008 campaign the six leading primary candidates (three Democratic, three Republican) listed a total of nearly two thousand bundlers.\n\nLobbyists often assist congressional campaign finance by arranging fundraisers, assembling PACs, and seeking donations from other clients. Many lobbyists become campaign treasurers and fundraisers for congresspersons.\n\nContributions made directly to a specific candidate are called \"hard money\" and those made to parties and committees are called \"soft money\". Soft money constitutes an alternative form of financing campaigns that emerged in the last years. It \"derives from a major loophole in federal campaign financing and spending law that exempts from regulation those contributions made for party building in general rather than for specific candidates\". There are no limits on soft money and some examples are donations for stickers, posters, and television and radio spots supporting a particular party platform or idea but not a concrete candidate. Most of such donations received by state party committees are then sent to the national party headquarters to spend as they please, including on political campaigns by candidates. Critics call this a legalized form of political \"money laundering.\"\n\nAnother form of soft money is political spending by \"independent expenditure committees\", commonly known as \"Super PACs,\" which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against any candidate(s) or issues, as long as there is no coordination, consultation or request by any campaign or candidate. Such donations in presidential elections amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. For the amounts of soft money contributed in recent years and the legislation that enabled this, see the section on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n\nOrganizations other than individual candidates and their campaigns also contribute to election spending. Campaign expenditures made by groups not associated with, and independent of, a candidate's campaign are known as \"independent expenditures\". In addition to donating money to political campaigns (according to the limits described above), these organizations can spend money directly to influence elections.\n\nFederal law allows for multiple types of political action committees (PACs).\n\n501(c)(4) \"social welfare\", 501(c)(5) \"labor unions\", 501(c)(6) \"chambers of commerce\" unlike 501(c)(3) charitable organizations can participate in political campaigns and elections, as long as the organization's \"primary purpose\" is issue advocacy and not political advocacy and are not required to disclose their donors publicly.[31]. This aspect of the law has led to extensive use of 501(c)(4) organizations in raising and donating money for political activity.[32] The NAACP, Planned Parenthood, Sierra Club, and National Rifle Association are well known examples of organizations that operate 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations that engage in political advocacy.\n\nA 527 organization or 527 group is a type of American tax-exempt organization named after \"Section 527\" of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Technically, almost all political committees, including state, local, and federal candidate committees, traditional political action committees, \"Super PACs\", and political parties are \"527s.\" However, in common practice the term is usually applied only to such organizations that are not regulated under state or federal campaign finance laws because they do not \"expressly advocate\" for the election or defeat of a candidate or party. When operated within the law, there are no upper limits on contributions to 527s and no restrictions on who may contribute. There are no spending limits imposed on these organizations. However, they must register with the IRS, publicly disclose their donors and file periodic reports of contributions and expenditures.\n\nPolitical party committees may contribute funds directly to candidates, subject to the contribution limits listed above. National and state party committees may make additional \"coordinated expenditures,\" subject to limits, to help their nominees in general elections. National party committees may also make unlimited \"independent expenditures\" to support or oppose federal candidates. However, since 2002, national parties have been prohibited from accepting any funds outside the limits established for elections in the FECA.\n\nCurrent campaign finance law at the federal level requires candidate committees, party committees, and PACs to file periodic reports disclosing the money they raise and spend. Federal candidate committees must identify, for example, all PACs and party committees that give them contributions, and they must provide the names, occupations, employers and addresses of all individuals who give them more than $200 in an election cycle. Additionally, they must disclose expenditures to any individual or vendor. The Federal Election Commission maintains this database and publishes the information about campaigns and donors on its website. (Similar reporting requirements exist in many states for state and local candidates and for PACs and party committees.)\n\nVarious organizations, including the Center for Responsive Politics, aggregate data on political contributions to provide insight into the influence of various groups. In August 2014, a new smartphone app called \"Buypartisan\" was released to allow consumers to scan the barcodes of items in grocery stores and see where that corporation and its leaders directed their political contributions.\n\nA major loophole to disclosure requirements is \"dark money,\" money donated by trade association groups and not-for-profit corporations, which are allowed to raise unlimited amounts from corporations and individuals, and to spend unlimited amounts any way they wish. Such spending is called dark money because the identity of the donors, the identity of the campaigns, candidates or other entities receiving the money, and the amounts raised and spent, are exempt from disclosure requirements. The amount of dark money raised and spent has been increasing very rapidly each election cycle in recent years in both state and federal elections, to the point that it now amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. presidential elections.\n\nNamed for its sponsor, South Carolina Senator Ben Tillman, the Tillman Act of 1907 prohibited corporations and nationally chartered (interstate) banks from making direct financial contributions to federal candidates. However, weak enforcement mechanisms made the Act ineffective. Disclosure requirements and spending limits for House and Senate candidates followed in 1910 and 1911. General contribution limits were enacted in the Federal Corrupt Practices Act (1925). An amendment to the Hatch Act of 1939 set an annual ceiling of $3 million for political parties' campaign expenditures and $5,000 for individual campaign contributions. The Smith-Connally Act (1943) and Taft-Hartley Act (1947) extended the corporate ban to labor unions.\n\nIn 1971, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), instituting various campaign finance disclosure requirements for federal candidates (those running for the House, the Senate, the President and the Vice President), political parties, and political action committees. In 1974, Congress passed amendments to the FECA establishing a comprehensive system of regulation and enforcement, including public financing of presidential campaigns and the creation of a central enforcement agency, the Federal Election Commission. The new regulations included limits on campaign finance, including caps on (1) individual contributions to candidates, (2) contributions to candidates by \"political committees\" (commonly known as Political Action Committees, or PACs), (3) total campaign expenditures, and (4) independent expenditures by individuals and groups \"relative to a clearly identified candidate.\"\n\nThe constitutionality of the FECA was challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court case \"Buckley v. Valeo\" (1976). In \"Buckley\", the Court upheld the Act's limits on individual contributions, as well as the disclosure and reporting provisions and the public financing scheme. The Court held that limitations on donations to candidates were constitutional because of the compelling state interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. However, the Court also held that caps on the amount campaigns could spend and caps on independent expenditures were an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech under the First Amendment. In addition, \"Buckley\" also held that the disclosure and reporting requirements of FECA could only apply to expenditures authorized or requested by a candidate or expenditures for communications that \"expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\"\n\nIt also showed the limited reach of campaign finance laws to candidate and party committees, and other committees with a major purpose of electing candidates, or to speech that \"expressly advocated\" election or defeat of candidates. In footnote 52 of that opinion, the Court listed eight words or phrases as illustrative of speech that qualified as \"express advocacy\". The definition of express advocacy is what created dark money groups.\n\nUnder FECA, corporations, unions, and individuals could contribute unlimited \"nonfederal money\"\u2014also known as \"soft money\"\u2014to political parties for activities intended to influence state or local elections. In a series of advisory opinions between 1977 and 1995, the FEC ruled that political parties could fund \"mixed-purpose\" activities\u2014including get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising\u2014in part with soft money, and that parties could also use soft money to defray the costs of \"legislative advocacy media advertisements,\" even if the ads mentioned the name of a federal candidate, so long as they did not expressly advocate the candidate's election or defeat. Furthermore, in 1996, the Supreme Court decided \"Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC\", in which the Court ruled that Congress could not restrict the total amount of \"independent expenditures\" made by a political party without coordination with a candidate, invalidating a FECA provision that restricted how much a political party could spend in connection with a particular candidate. As a result of these rulings, soft money effectively enabled parties and candidates to circumvent FECA's limitations on federal election campaign contributions.\n\nSoft money raised from 1993 to 2002\nIn 2002, Congress further attempted to reform federal campaign financing with the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. The BCRA, sometimes called the \"McCain-Feingold\" Act, amended the FECA in several respects. First, it prohibited national political party committees from soliciting or spending any soft money and prohibited state and local party committees from using soft money for activities that affect federal elections. Second, it prohibited the use of corporate and union treasury funds to pay for \"electioneering communications\"\u2014broadcast or cable advertisements clearly identifying a federal candidate\u2014within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. The law also included a \"stand by your ad\" provision requiring candidates to appear in campaign advertisements and claim responsibility for the ad (most commonly with a phrase similar to \"I'm John Smith and I approve this message.\")\n\nThis law was also challenged in the Supreme Court, but its core provisions were upheld by the Supreme Court in \"McConnell v. Federal Election Commission\". However, in \"McConnell\", the Court also interpreted the \"electioneering communications\" provisions of BCRA to exempt \"nonprofit corporations that [1] were formed for the sole purpose of promoting political ideas, [2] did not engage in business activities, and [3] did not accept contributions from for-profit corporations or labor unions.\" Thus, non-business, non-profit political organizations could run electioneering advertisements provided that they did not accept corporate or union donations.\n\nFurthermore, the BCRA did not regulate \"527 organizations\" (named for the section of the tax code under which they operate). These nonprofit organizations are not regulated by the FEC, provided that they do not coordinate with candidates or expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a specific candidate. After the passage of the BCRA, many of the soft money-funded activities previously undertaken by political parties were taken over by various 527 groups, which funded many issue ads in the 2004 presidential election. The heavy spending of key 527 groups to attack presidential candidates brought complaints to the Federal Elections Commission of illegal coordination between the groups and rival political campaigns. (In 2006 and 2007 the FEC fined a number of organizations, including MoveOn.org and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, for violations arising from the 2004 campaign. The FEC's rationale was that these groups had specifically advocated the election or defeat of candidates, thus making them subject to federal regulation and its limits on contributions to the organizations.)\n\nMain article: FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life\n\nThe reach of the \"electioneering communications\" provisions of the BCRA was also limited in the 2007 Supreme Court ruling \"Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.\" In \"Wisconsin Right to Life\", the Supreme Court stated that the restrictions on \"electioneering communications\" applied only to advertisements that \"can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate.\" Thus, if there was any reasonable way to view an advertisement as an \"issue ad,\" it would be exempt from the BCRA's restrictions.\n\nCampaign finance law in the United States changed drastically in the wake of two 2010 judicial opinions: the Supreme Court's decision in \"Citizens United v. FEC\" and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in \"SpeechNow.org v. FEC\". According to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report, these two decisions constitute \"the most fundamental changes to campaign finance law in decades.\" \n\n\"Citizens United\" struck down, on free speech grounds, the limits on the ability of organizations that accepted corporate or union money from running electioneering communications. The Court reasoned that the restrictions permitted by \"Buckley\" were justified based on avoiding corruption or the appearance of corruption, and that this rationale did not apply to corporate donations to independent organizations. \"Citizens United\" overruled the 1990 case \"Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce\", in which the Supreme Court upheld the Michigan Campaign Finance Act, which prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections.\n\nTwo months later, a unanimous nine-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decided \"SpeechNow\", which relied on \"Citizens United\" to hold that Congress could not limit donations to organizations that only made independent expenditures, that is, expenditures that were \"uncoordinated\" with a candidate's campaign. These decisions led to the rise of \"independent-expenditure only\" PACs, commonly known as \"Super PACs.\" Super PACs, under \"Citizens United\" and \"SpeechNow\", can raise unlimited funds from individual and corporate donors and use those funds for electioneering advertisements, provided that the Super PAC does not coordinate with a candidate.\n\nOn February 19, 2013, the Supreme Court announced it would hear \"McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission\", a case challenging the limit on how much individuals can donate directly to political parties and federal candidates. On April 2, 2014, the Court announced its opinion and maintained aggregate limits on campaign contributions were unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n\nAt the federal level, public funding is limited to subsidies for presidential campaigns. This includes (1) a \"matching\" program for the first $250 of each individual contribution during the primary campaign and (2) funding the major party nominees' general election campaigns. Through the 2012 campaign, public funding was also available to finance the major parties' national nominating conventions.\n\nTo receive subsidies in the primary, candidates must qualify by privately raising $5000 each in at least 20 states. During the primaries, in exchange for agreeing to limit his or her spending according to a statutory formula, eligible candidates receive matching payments for the first $250 of each individual contribution (up to half of the spending limit). However, candidates who decline matching funds are free to spend as much money as they can raise privately.\n\nFrom the inception of this program in 1976 through 1992, almost all candidates who could qualify accepted matching funds in the primary. In 1996 Republican Steve Forbes opted out of the program. In 2000, Forbes and George W. Bush opted out. In 2004 Bush and Democrats John Kerry and Howard Dean chose not to take matching funds in the primary. In 2008, Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republicans John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and Ron Paul decided not to take primary matching funds. Republican Tom Tancredo and Democrats Chris Dodd, Joe Biden and John Edwards elected to take public financing.\n\nSince the 2012 primary campaign, few candidates have chosen to accept matching funds. In 2012, only Buddy Roemer (who ran unsuccessfully for the Americans Elect and Reform Party nominations), Gary Johnson (the eventual Libertarian nominee), and Jill Stein (the eventual Green Party nominee) received matching funds in the primaries. (Primary season matching funds are not limited to major party candidates.) In 2016, only Martin O'Malley (Democrat) and Jill Stein (Green) received matching funds in the primaries. For the 2020 campaign, only Steve Bullock (Democrat) has announced plans to apply for matching funds so far.\n\nIn addition to primary matching funds, the public funding program also assists with funding the major party (and eligible minor party) nominees' general election campaigns. The grants for the major parties' general election nominees are adjusted each Presidential election year to account for increases in the cost of living. In 2012, the parties' general election nominees were eligible to receive $91.2 million in public funds, although neither the Democratic or Republican campaigns chose to accept those funds. If general election candidates accept public funds, they agree not to raise or spend private funds or to spend more than $50,000 of their personal resources. Hence, general election candidates who have the ability to raise more than the amount of public funds offered may decline the offer of public funds in favor of privately raising and spending a larger sum of money.\n\nNo major party nominee turned down government funds for the general election from 1976, when the program was launched, until Barack Obama did so in 2008. Obama again declined government funds for the 2012 campaign, as did Republican nominee Mitt Romney, setting up the first election since the program's launch in which neither major party nominee accepted federal funding. Nor did either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton accept federal funding for the 2016 general election.\n\nPublic funding was formerly available to finance the major parties' (and eligible minor parties') presidential nominating conventions. In 2012, each major party was entitled to $18.2 million in public funds for their conventions. However, the provisions for public funding of nominating conventions were eliminated in 2014. \n\nEligibility of minor parties for public funds is based on showing in the previous election, with 5% of the popular vote needed to qualify. The only party other than the Republicans and Democrats to receive government funding in a general election was the Reform Party, which qualified for public funding in 1996 and 2000 on the basis of Ross Perot's strong showing in the 1992 and 1996 elections. In addition, John B. Anderson's 1980 campaign received payments of public funds after the election because he had attained more than 5% of the popular vote.\n\nThe presidential public financing system is funded by a $3 tax check-off on individual tax returns (the check off does not increase the filer's taxes, but merely directs $3 of the government's general fund to the presidential fund). The number of taxpayers who use the check off has fallen steadily since the early 1980s, until by 2006 fewer than 8 percent of taxpayers were directing money to the fund, leaving the fund chronically short of cash. However, the fact that fewer candidates have chosen to apply for public funding has alleviated the fund's former monetary shortages.\n\nA small number of states and cities have started to use broader programs for public financing of campaigns. One method, which its supporters call Clean Money, Clean Elections, gives each candidate who chooses to participate a fixed amount of money. To qualify for this subsidy, the candidates must collect a specified number of signatures and small (usually $5) contributions. The candidates are not allowed to accept outside donations or to use their own personal money if they receive this public funding. Candidates who choose to raise money privately rather than accept the government subsidy are subject to significant administrative burdens and legal restrictions, with the result that most candidates accept the subsidy. This procedure has been in place in races for all statewide and legislative offices in Arizona and Maine since 2000, where a majority of officials were elected without spending any private contributions on their campaigns. Connecticut passed a Clean Elections law in 2005, along with the cities of Portland, Oregon and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nA 2003 study by GAO found, \"It is too soon to determine the extent to which the goals of Maine's and Arizona's public financing programs are being met.\"\n\nThe \"Clean Elections\" movement had several defeats in the 2000s and 2010s. Proposition 89, a California ballot proposition in November 2006, sponsored by the California Nurses Union, that would have provided for public financing of political campaigns and strict contribution limits on corporations, was defeated. In 2008, the non-partisan California Fair Elections Act passed the legislature and Governor Schwarzenegger signed it, but the law did not take effect unless approved by voters in a referendum in 2010. In June 2010, voters soundly rejected the measure, 57% to 43%. A proposal to implement Clean Elections in Alaska was voted down by a two-to-one margin in 2008, and a pilot program in New Jersey was terminated in 2008 amid concern about its constitutionality and that the law was ineffective in accomplishing its goals. In 2010, Portland voters used a referendum to repeal the clean elections law, originally enacted by the city council. In 2006, in \"Randall v. Sorrell\", the Supreme Court held that large parts of Vermont's Clean Elections law were unconstitutional. In 2008, the Supreme Court's decision in \"Davis v. Federal Election Commission\" suggested that a key part of most Clean Election laws\u2014a provision granting extra money (or \"rescue funds\") to participating candidates who are being outspent by non-participating candidates\u2014is unconstitutional. In 2011, in \"Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett\", the Supreme Court struck down the matching funds provision of Arizona's law on First Amendment grounds.\n\nMassachusetts has had a hybrid public funding system for statewide offices since 1978. Taxpayers are allowed to contribute $1 to the statewide election fund by checking a box on their annual income taxes. Candidates who agree to spending limits are eligible for money from this fund. Non-participating candidates are required to estimate spending, and this will raise the limit for participating opponents if higher than the agreed-to limit.\n\nSeattle voters approved the Democracy voucher program in 2015, which gives city residents four $25 vouchers to donate to participating candidates.\n\nA 2016 experimental study in the \"American Journal of Political Science\" found that politicians made themselves more available for meetings with individuals when they believed that the individuals had donated to their campaign. A 2011 study found that \"even after controlling for past contracts and other factors, companies that contributed more money to federal candidates subsequently received more contracts.\" A 2016 study in the \"Journal of Politics\" found that industries overseen by committees decreased their contributions to congresspeople who recently departed from the committees and that they immediately increase their contributions to new members of the committees, which is \"evidence that corporations and business PACs use donations to acquire immediate access and favor\u2014suggesting they at least anticipate that the donations will influence policy.\" Research by University of Chicago political scientist Anthony Fowler and Northwestern University political scientists Haritz Garro and J\u00f6rg L. Spenkuch found no evidence that corporations that donated to a candidate received any monetary benefits from the candidate winning election.\n\nA 2017 study found that \"only a small portion of Americans make campaign donations\" and that both Democratic and Republican donors \"are more ideologically extreme than other partisans, including primary voters. With respect to why individuals contribute, we show that donors appear responsive to their perception of the stakes in the election.\"\n\nAnother 2017 study found that relatively unpopular industries provide larger contributions to candidates. The authors of the study argue that this is because candidates lose voter support when they are associated with unpopular industries and that the industries therefore provide larger contributions to compensate for this loss of support.\n\nMany localities have their own reporting requirements that are not listed here.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166874", "title": "Odense Steel Shipyard", "text": "Odense Steel Shipyard () was a Danish shipyard company located in Odense. It was best known for building container ships for its parent group, A.P. Moller \u2013 Maersk Group, including the M\u00e6rsk E class in 2006 which at the time were the biggest container ships in the world. The global financial crisis led to Maersk announcing its closure in 2009 and the last new ship was delivered in January 2012.\n\nThe first yard was opened in 1918\u20131919 by the A.P. M\u00f8ller company. A new yard with bigger and better facilities was constructed 1957\u20131959 on a new site located in Munkebo a few kilometres outside Odense proper. Odense Steel Shipyard was the largest yard within the Odense Steel Shipyard Group, which also consisted of two yards and an engineering company, all situated in the Baltic. The yard was known for designing and building innovative vessels that applied the newest technology in design and equipment.\n\nSince 1996 the Yard built some of the world's largest container ships; including the M\u00e6rsk E-class with a nominal capacity of 15,550 TEU (originally declared as 11,000 TEU), the highest equivalent number of any vessel as of today. However, Maersk chose Daewoo to build its latest and largest design, the Triple E class with a nominal capacity of 18,000 TEU, as the Asian shipyard was more competitive.\nThe original shipyard remained in operation until 1966, when all operations were transferred to the new site. Unlike the modern shipyard, the old yard produced civilian and merchant vessels only. Its first completed ship was cargo steamship \"Robert M\u00e6rsk\", completed in 1920. Its last production was Yard No. 177, the bulk carrier \"Laura M\u00e6rsk\".\n\nThe new shipyard originally had two building docks, No. I and II (300 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 7.5 metres each), allowing the construction of tankers of up to . The yard was enlarged in 1967 to include a new very large building dock, No. III (415 \u00d7 90 metres), and an 800-ton, 95 metre tall, 148.5 metre span gantry crane, allowing the construction of tankers in the VLCC and ULCC class. The largest construction planned on the yard was two tankers, but this order was later cancelled. From the 1960s until 1977, the yard only constructed oil tankers (no larger than ) as well as bulk carriers. The first RO-RO ship was built in 1979, and the first container ship in 1980. In December 1992, the yard completed the world's first 300,000 DWT double-hull tanker. In January 1996 they delivered its first Post-Panamax container ship. On 3 December 1999 the gantry crane collapsed after a hurricane in the building dock and damaged the ship No.170 \"Cornelius M\u00e6rsk\", which was nonetheless was repaired and delivered two months later. MAN Takraf of Leipzig, Germany, delivered a new 1,000 ton, 110 metre tall gantry crane in April 2001.\n\nThe collapse in world shipping as a result of the 2009 Global Recession led Maersk to announce in January 2009 that Odense would concentrate on smaller ships but in May 2009 they announced that they would be closing the yard altogether and putting Baltija Shipyard in Lithuania up for sale. The last newbuild from Lind\u00f8 was No.714 \"Niels Juel\", a frigate for the Royal Danish Navy, which was delivered in January 2012.\n\nAfter the closure of the yard in 2012, the site has been transformed to an industrial park housing a large number of companies within the offshore sector. Most companies work with production, storage and discharge of large components for offshore and heavy industries. The area of more than , of which is under roof, combined with the gantry crane and the harbour area makes it ideal for handling heavy industry. The 10MW LORC wind turbine test facility was expanding in 2015 at a cost of DKK 120m, and a different type of test facility for over 20MW was in construction in 2019.\n\nIn December 2014 DONG Energy ordered 32 Vestas V164 wind turbines (256 MW) for the extension of the 90 MW Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm. The nacelles will be produced at Lind\u00f8.\n\nElements of the yard (OMT ) are proposing the s for the Procurement programme of the Royal Australian Navy's frigates, but built in Australia.\n"}, {"id": "2166875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166875", "title": "Kohala Historical Sites State Monument", "text": "Kohala Historical Sites State Monument includes the National Historic Landmark Mookini Heiau and the birthplace of Kamehameha I.\nIt is located in remote North Kohala on the Island of Hawaii.\n\nMookini Heiau is one of the oldest historical sites in Hawaii and among its most sacred. \"Mookini\" means \"many lineages\" or \"many Moo\" in the Hawaiian Language. Moo are large reptile goddesses honored by Hawaiians since before the time of Paao.\n\nThis heiau is a living spiritual temple and not just an historic artifact of the Hawaiian culture. Oral histories indicate the original temple on the site may be 1500 years old: the genealogy chant of the heiau's kahuna tells of Kuamo'o Mo'okini arriving here in 480, not from Samoa or Tahiti, but from the Persian Gulf of Middle East. Evidence suggests the current temple was built on the site of this smaller older one by Paao, who brought the Hawaiian Religion to the islands sometime between 1100 and 1300 A.D.\n\nThe current site includes the remains of the heiau measuring 250' x 130' with an open stone paved court enclosed by 20'-high stone walls, and the sacrificial stone. The heiau is constructed of stones that are said to have been passed from hand to hand from the Polol\u016b Valley, over away. One tradition states that the heiau was completed by the menehune (mythical Hawai'ian little people) in one night.\n\nFor centuries a strict set of rules (kapu) were enforced at the heiau. It was a closed heiau reserved exclusively for the Alii Nui (the highest chiefs) for praying and offering human sacrifices, primarily to the war god K\u016b. In Kohala Mookini Heiau was the focus of religious life and order. In November 1978 Kahuna Nui Leimomi Mookini Lum rededicated the Mookini Luakini to the \"Children of the Land\" (\"kama aina\") and lifted the restrictive kapu. In doing this she made the site safe for all persons to enter the heiau and created a place of learning for future generations to discover the past. Her family has been taking care of the temple for centuries. \n\nA few hundred yards away is \"Kamehameha Akahi \u02bb\u0100ina H\u0101nau\", the birthplace of Kamehameha the Great. He is said to have been born here in 1758 as Halley's Comet passed overhead. The entrance to the site is on the south side. A rock is said to mark the precise place of the birth of Kamehameha.\n\nKohala Historical Sites State Monument can only be reached by a dirt road from Upolu Airport and is located about 1\u00bd miles off the Akoni Pule Highway. \nTurn North on Upolu Point road near the town of Hawi, and West at the small air strip. \nA four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended, especially if it has been raining.\nThe birthplace includes a sign and enclosure located at coordinates .\n\nThe Heiau was declared a National Historic Landmark on December 29, 1962, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 as site 66000284.\nA clear day provides a striking view of Maui.\n\nNear Mo'okini Heiau are two other smaller heiaus whose access is limited. Mahukona Heiau, dedicated to Lono god, nine miles from Mo'okini, rises from a steep hillside.

He also used the pen name \"Amoy Ku\".\n\nGu Hongming was born in Penang, British Malaya (present day Malaysia), the second son of a Chinese rubber plantation superintendent, whose ancestral hometown was Tong'an, Fujian province, China, and his Portuguese wife. The British plantation owner was fond of Gu and took him, at age ten, to Scotland for his education. He was then known as Koh Hong Beng (the Min Nan pronunciation of his name). In 1873 he began studying Literature at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in the spring of 1877 with an M.A. He then earned a diploma in Civil Engineering at the University of Leipzig, and studied law in Paris.\nHe returned to Penang in 1880, and soon joined the colonial Singapore civil service, where he worked until 1883. He went to China in 1885, and served as an advisor to the ranking official Zhang Zhidong for twenty years.\n\nLeo Tolstoy and Gu were both opposed to the Hundred Days' Reform, which was led by prominent reformist intellectuals of the time, including Kang Youwei.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1908, he was the director of the Huangpu River Authority (\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d5a\u6cbb\u9ec3\u6d66\u6c5f\u6cb3\u9053\u5c40) in Shanghai. He served in the Imperial Foreign Ministry from 1908 to 1910, then as the president of the Nanyang Public School, the forerunner of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He resigned the latter post in 1911 as a sign of his loyalty to the fallen imperial Qing government. In 1915, he became a professor at Peking University. Beginning in 1924 he lived in Japan and Japanese-administered Taiwan for three years as a guest lecturer in Oriental cultures. Then he returned to live in Beijing until his death on 30 April 1928 at the age of 72.\n\nAn advocate of monarchy and Confucian values, preserving his queue even after the overthrow of Qing Dynasty, Gu became a kind of cultural curiosity late in his life. In 1934, writer Wen Yuan-ning wrote: \"That ostentatious display of his queue is very symptomatic of the whole man. He is cross-grained: he lives by opposition.\" Many sayings and anecdotes have been attributed to him, few of which can be attested. Literary figures as diverse as Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Somerset Maugham and Rabindranath Tagore were all drawn to visit him when they were in China. No scholarly edition of his complete works is available.\n\nHe was fluent in English, Chinese, German, Russian and French, and understood Italian, Ancient Greek, Latin, Japanese and Malay. He acquired Chinese only after his studies in Europe, and was said to have a bad Chinese hand-writing. However, his command of the language is far above average. He penned several Chinese books, including a vivid memoir recollecting his days as an assistant for Zhang Zhidong.\n\nHis character appeared in the drama \"Towards the Republic\".\n\nHis English works include: \n\nHe translated some of the Confucian classics into English:\n\n\nHe rendered William Cowper's narrative poem \"The Diverting History of John Gilpin\" into classical Chinese verse (known as \u7661\u6f22\u9a0e\u99ac\u6b4c).\n\n"}, {"id": "2166883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166883", "title": "Abdallah ibn Yasin", "text": "Abdallah Ibn Yasin (died 7 July 1059 C.E. in \"Krifla\" near Rommani, Morocco) was a theologian, founder, and first leader of the Almoravid movement and dynasty.\n\nAbdallah ibn Yasin was from the tribe of the Jazulah (\"pronounced Guezula\"), a Sanhaja sub-tribe from the Sous. He was a Maliki theologian, he was a disciple of Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti and studied in his Ribat, \"Dar al-Murabitin\" which was located in the village of Aglu, (near present-day Tiznit). In 1046 the Gudala chief Yahya Ibn Ibrahim, came to the Ribat asking for someone to promulgate Islamic religious teachings amongst the Berber of the Adrar (present-day Mauritania) and Waggag ibn Zallu chose to send Abdallah ibn Yasin with him. The Sanhaja were at this stage only superficially Islamicised and still clung to many heathen practices, and so Ibn Yasin preached to them an orthodox Sunnism.\n\nAfter a revolt of the Godala he was forced to withdraw with his followers. In alliance with Yahya ibn Umar, the leader of the Lamtuna tribe, he managed to quell the rebellion.\n\nIbn Yasin now formed the Almoravid alliance from the tribes of the Lamtuna, the Masufa and the Godala, with himself as spiritual leader and Yahya ibn Umar taking the military command. In 1054 the Maghrawa-ruled Sijilmasa was conquered. Ibn Yasin introduced his orthodox rule - amongst other things wine and music were forbidden, non-Islamic taxes were abolished and one fifth of the spoils of war were allocated to the religious experts. This rigorous application of Islam soon provoked a revolt in 1055.\n\nYahya ibn Umar was killed in 1056 in a renewed revolt of the Gudala in the Sahara, upon which Ibn Yasin appointed Yahya's brother Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar (1056\u20131087) the new military leader. Abu Bakr destroyed Sijilmasa, but was not able to force the Gudala back into the Almoravid league. He went on to capture S\u016bs and its capital Aghmat (close to where is now Marrakech) in 1058.\n\nIbn Yasin died while attempting to subjugate the Barghawata on the Atlantic coast in 1059. He is replaced by Sulaiman ibn Haddu who, who, killed in turn, will not be replaced.

The story describes a German invasion of British India and the reaction of the Nazi occupation authorities to the nonviolent resistance and pacifism of Mohandas Gandhi and his followers. This story was later reprinted in Turtledove's short-story collection \"Kaleidoscope\" in 1990, and the variety showcase \"The Best Military Science Fiction of the Twentieth Century\" in 2001.\n\nGermany's success in World War II has led to their invasion of the British Raj in 1947, resulting in the British Indian Army being decisively defeated. Rather than struggling for independence from the Crown, Gandhi and his friend Jawaharlal Nehru find themselves in the position of resisting Nazi occupation using the techniques that were successfully employed against the British. Although Nehru has a general concept of the inherently immoral nature of Nazi ideology, Gandhi thinks they still can be persuaded, not heeding the warning from an Austrian Jew named Simon Wiesenthal, who was able to flee occupied Poland to India.\n\nThe Nazis, however, led by Field Marshal Walther Model, are completely unmoved by Gandhi's strategy. They view themselves as a master race and have no moral qualms about killing those who resist non-violently (or even those who do not resist at all, if they are of a certain race). In the end the movement collapses as it proves unable to deal with the savagery of Nazism.\n\nGandhi assumes a moral equivalence between the Nazi and British imperialists, naively dismissing reports otherwise; the story makes clear that this is a lethal mistake stemming from Gandhi's reluctance to entertain the idea that his moral and ethical assumptions are not shared in common among all human groups. Loyalty is explored as a powerful but amoral force. Gandhi is loyal to his concepts of passive resistance, however poorly they fit the situation or inevitably they lead to violence; the Indians are loyal to Gandhi, and some die for it; Model is loyal is to his rank and volk; the British are loyal to their ideas of decency and mercy and defend them to the last, through the medium of war.\nThe story illustrates the weakness inherent in Gandhi and later Martin Luther King, Jr.'s nonviolence movement, the success of which depends on a reasoned appeal to the enemy's conscience\u2014that is, on the ability to arouse shame and remorse in the oppressor, who eventually relents. This was a plausible strategy against British imperialism or American institutional racism, as the notion of oppression clashes unpleasantly with the values espoused by these nations. Historically, ideals of freedom, justice, and equality for all citizens are at the root of the British and American political system and, perhaps more important, the religion and national self-image of the people. The story explores the strategic difference between opposing a tolerant competitor, such as the British, and opposing a remorselessly violent foe, suggesting that violent resistance to malign forces like Nazism, such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, is more likely to succeed than a pacifistic approach. Violence does not guarantee success, however; the Warsaw uprising is indicated as a failure.\n\nField Marshal Model compares the Nazi empire with ancient Rome facing the early Christians, pointing out that Rome's collapse came as a result of its tolerance of a force that sought to undermine it. The story does not characterize Model as a bloodthirsty savage; rather, he is a merely a professional doing his job. Turtledove provides an appearance by Jurgen Stroop, the SS officer responsible for the Warsaw Ghetto massacre, to contrast Stroop's mindless savagery and Model's workmanlike, impassive decimation of the Indian resistance.\n\nIt has been speculated that the story takes place in the same universe as \"In the Presence of Mine Enemies\" by the same author, but he has never confirmed this.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166898", "title": "Papilio machaon", "text": "Papilio machaon, the Old World swallowtail, is a butterfly of the family Papilionidae. The butterfly is also known as the common yellow swallowtail or simply the swallowtail (a common name applied to all members of the family, but this species was the first to be given the name). It is the type species of the genus \"Papilio\".\n\nNamed for Machaon (ancient Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03c7\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd) a figure in Greek mythology. He was a son of Asclepius.\n\n\"Papilio machaon\" was named by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\" in 1758, alongside nearly 200 other species of butterfly. Later, Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille designated it as the type species of the genus \"Papilio\". \"Papilio appalachiensis\" and \"Papilio xuthus\" are also of the same genus. The specific epithet \"\" refers to Machaon, son of Asclepius in the works of Homer.\n\nThere are 41 recognized subspecies, that include: \n\"Papilio machaon gorganus\" is strongly migratory in Europe and may be found in almost all habitats. In the UK, \"P. m. britannicus\" is an endemic subspecies, but occasionally individuals of the continental subspecies \"P. m. gorganus\" breed temporarily on the south coast. Subspecies \"P. m. britannicus\" differs from the continental subspecies in being more heavily marked in black. The Maltese Islands are home to another endemic subspecies, \"P. m. melitensis\".\n\nThis butterfly is present throughout the entire Palearctic region, ranging from Russia to China and Japan, (including the Himalayas and Taiwan), and across into Alaska, Canada, and the United States, and thus, is not restricted to the Old World, despite the common name. In Asia, it is reported as far south as Saudi Arabia, Oman, the high mountains of Yemen, Lebanon, Iran and Israel. In southern Asia, it occurs in Pakistan and Kashmir, northern India (Sikkim, to Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar.\n\nThis butterfly is widespread in Europe. In the United Kingdom, it is limited to a few areas in the Norfolk Broads of East Anglia. It is the UK's largest resident butterfly. The monarch (\"Danaus plexippus\") is slightly larger, but is only a rare vagrant.\n\nAs \"P. machaon\" is widespread throughout Eurasia and often common, it is not threatened as a species. It is listed as \"vulnerable\" in the South Korean and Austrian Red Data Books, and in the Red Data Book of the former Soviet Union. In Armenia the species demonstrates stable population trend and is assessed as Least Concern. \n\nIn some countries, \"P. machaon\" and its subspecies are protected by law. \"Papilio machaon machaon\" is protected by law in six provinces of Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova. The species is protected in the United Kingdom, and subspecies \"verityi\" is protected in India.\n\nThe imago typically has yellow wings with black vein markings, and a wingspan of . The hindwings of both sexes have a pair of protruding tails which give the butterfly its common name from the resemblance to the birds of the same name. Just below each tail is one red and six blue eye spots.\n\nIn the caterpillar stage, \"P. machaon\" has a length of . When young, the caterpillar resembles a bird dropping, giving it camouflage. The caterpillar also protects itself using a large orange fork which protrudes behind its head.\n\nIt can be distinguished from \"Papilio hospiton\", which occurs sympatrically with it on Corsica and Sardinia, by the longer \"tails\" on the hindwings. It can be told apart from the Algerian species \"Papilio saharae\" only by counting the segments on the antennae.\n\nThe butterfly has a strong and fast flight, but frequently pauses to hover over flowering herbs and sip nectar. It frequents alpine meadows and hillsides, and males are fond of 'hilltopping', congregating near summits to compete for passing females. At lower elevations, it can be seen visiting gardens.\n\nUnlike other swallowtails which specialise on Rutaceae, this species mostly feeds on plants of family Umbelliferae, females laying eggs singly. Milk parsley (also known as marsh hog's fennel) is normally the only food plant used by the caterpillars of the British subspecies. The food plants of the swallowtail in Europe, Asia, and North America are more varied than in the UK. It uses a wide variety of umbellifers including wild carrot (\"Daucus carota\"), wild angelica (\"Angelica sylvestris\"), fennel (\"Foeniculum vulgare\"), and hogweeds (\"Heracleum\"). In the Maltese Islands, the caterpillar feeds on plants such as rue (\"Ruta chalepensis\") in addition to Umbelliferae such as fennel.\n\nIn Kashmir, the common yellow swallowtail, as \"Papilio machaon\" is called there, inhabits alpine meadows in the Himalayas occurring from in Kashmir valley to in the Garhwal Himalayas. In India, in Himachal Pradesh, it is found over only and in Sikkim over only.\n\nAt lower elevations, these butterflies fly from March to September; at higher elevations, they are limited by the short summer seasons.\n\nThe British subspecies \"P. m. brittanicus\" is less mobile than its European continental counterpart and stays within, or close by, its fenland habitat.\n\nThere are usually two to three broods in a year, but in northern areas, the species may be univoltine. In some places such as the UK, some will pupate and emerge in the same year and others will overwinter as pupae before emerging the following year, a situation known as being partially bivoltine.\n\nThe caterpillar spends the first part of its life with the appearance of a bird dropping, an effective defense against predators. As the caterpillar grows larger, it becomes green with black and orange markings. It has a defense against predators in the form of an \"osmeterium\", which consists of retractable, fleshy projections behind its head that can release a foul smell if disturbed, which deters insects, but not birds.\n\nOld World swallowtails can easily be bred in captivity. Butterflies can be lured to lay eggs in a backyard garden by keeping plenty of caterpillar food plants in it. Common rue plants are highly appropriate for this.\nOnce eggs or young caterpillars have been collected, they can be kept in a pot with holes on its top to allow air circulation. More than one caterpillar may be kept in a single pot since they do not attack each other (although they might sometimes get frightened by other caterpillars moving). They can be fed any of their food plants. Fennel is one of the easiest to find in the wild. Care must be taken with fennel as well as dill, though, because they will not eat hard, woody stems; they need to be fed the tender leaves. They can also be fed rue or milk parsley. Feeding them with unsuitable plants will lead to death from starvation.\n\nCaterpillars are very fast eaters; they will spend their time eating or resting before they resume their eating again. Once a sufficient size has been attained, they will attach themselves to any available structure with their silky threads. They will then stay still until they become pupae. This will take about a day.\n\nOnce in the pupa stage, they can be very carefully removed from the pot and placed in a warm location. The time the butterfly takes to form and come out depends on the temperature. If kept in warm summer temperatures, it will take about one or two weeks to form. On the other hand, if the temperature is lower, it might take as long as several months until it feels the weather is warm enough.\n\nPupae should not be kept on an impermeable surface, since when they eclose a bit of liquid will be released, this means the butterfly would stay wet and might not be able to fly. Absorbing paper such as the one used in kitchens is advisable.\n\nPalearctic ecozone\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166908", "title": "New York Central Lines LLC", "text": "New York Central Lines LLC was a limited liability company that owned railroad lines in the United States that are owned and operated by CSX Transportation.

The Belgian parts of the village are called Baarle-Hertog and the Dutch elements are called Baarle-Nassau. The Belgian part includes 16 exclaves within Dutch territory. The exclaves, in turn, surround seven Dutch areas. Belgian territory also surrounds an eighth Dutch area near Ginhoven. In 1995 the border was finalized to include a formerly neutral grassland. This village contains three quadripoints.\n\nThe line of the border means that some buildings straddle both countries. This is the case for a branch of Zeeman. For these properties, the (literally: \"front door rule\") policy applies: their address lies in the country that contains their front door. The exception is a house on Loveren street with both Belgian (#2) and Dutch (#19) front doors. For convenience, every house number plaque shows a flag.\n\nThere are various theories about the origin of the name \"Baarle\" (referred to in old sources as \"Barle\" or \"Barlo\"). The last part certainly originates from the -loo suffix, which means forest on sandy ground, next to a settlement. The first part could be interpreted as:\n\nThe suffixes \"Hertog\" and \"Nassau\" refer respectively to the \"Hertog\" (Duke) of Brabant and the House of Nassau which held the Lordship of Breda.\n\nThe name of the Tommel hamlet has its origins in the Latin word \"tumulus\", meaning Tumulus and there are a number of prehistoric tumuli in the vicinity. Urns have also been found around Tommel, evidence that this area has been inhabited since the Bronze Age.\n\nDuring the twelfth century the area was marshland. In 1198, Henry I, Duke of Brabant made over some of the land to Godfried of Schoten, the Lord of Breda. Hendrick kept the lands that were paying him a rent. The area that Hendrick kept is now part of Belgium. The area that was given to Gotfried is now in the Netherlands. The title \"Lord of Breda\" is now held by Willem-Alexander, king of the Netherlands. The title \"Duke of Brabant\" is now a courtesy title of the heir to the Belgian throne.\n\nBaarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau each have a burgemeester (mayor). Each town has its own elected town council and each has a police station. Each town has its own church. In some areas the two town councils can cooperate. They have set up a joint council to look after things like electricity, water and gas supplies, highway maintenance and refuse collection. The border was only finally defined in 1995.\n\nBoth councils also fund a joint cultural centre that houses a combined library. The cultural centre has two official entrances. The international border passes through the building. The Dutch entrance is at 7 Pastoor de Katerstraat. The Belgian entrance is at 5 Pastoor de Katerstraat. The tourist office is affiliated to both the Dutch and the Belgian tourist boards.\n\nDutch trading law applies to the Dutch parts of the town. Belgian trading laws apply to the Belgian parts of the town. Differences in the laws have long encouraged smuggling, but European integration, especially since 1993, has made it much less relevant. After the Second World War many people smuggled butter from the Netherlands into Belgium. In modern times many people still buy fireworks in Belgium and smuggle them into the Netherlands.\n\nThe areas of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog are essentially agrarian in character, although there is some industrial activity. The complex situation led to smuggling becoming a significant source of income in this area. The middle class also profited from the exceptional situation. There is an expensive and busy selection of shops. There are also numerous parks in the vicinity.\n\nAs predicted, the population of Baarle, for the first decade of the 21st century, shows a downward trend.\n\nBaarle contains, alongside broad agricultural settlements, a number of natural areas. Merkshe in the south is a beautiful stream valley and the Hollandse Bossen (Dutch Forests) in the west form an estate. Bels Lijntje, a former railway line, is now a bicycle path for tourists that runs from Riel to Turnhout.\n\nThe power grid has been set up redundantly.\n\nUntil August 26, 2012, the Flemish company Telenet provided both Dutch and Flemish television to Baarle. Since August 26, 2012, Telenet may not offer more services to the Dutch section of Baarle, because the cable, which belongs to Eandis, was bought out by the Dutch company Reggefiber. They have locked the cable distribution and provides fiber to the Dutch network. That means that the Dutch area of Baarle is now serviced by Dutch providers (such as KPN, Tele2 and Telfort) can provide service, but Flemish providers can no longer be used (such as receivers of Flemish commercial broadcasters, for example VTM).\n\nIn the Belgian area of Baarle there have been few changes. Telenet continues to offer service to the area, the Dutch commercial broadcasters (such as RTL 4) have removed the analogue cable offerings and these stations only provide digital reception. These are only available through cable (and thus through Telenet); other Belgian providers of radio, TV and internet are accessed via ADSL. They have no Dutch commercial broadcasters included within their package.\n\n\n\nMany streets are visited by a rubbish collector twice per week (1\u00d7 Dutch, 1\u00d7 Belgian). The recycling centre on Smederijstraat can be used by the whole population of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog.\n\nThe mail is delivered by PostNL in the Dutch area and bpost in the Belgian area.\n\nThe telephone network is redundantly served by KPN and Belgacom, but with a special condition: calls between Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau are available at local rates. Also, every GSM provider from the Netherlands and Belgium is available.\n\nDue to legislation, there is an erotic video store in Baarle-Nassau and a fireworks store in Baarle-Hertog which is open the entire year. In Baarle there is Sunday shopping every week. This is a result of the fact that the stores can always be open on Sunday in Belgium and that, in Baarle-Nassau, many rely on the tourist attractions resulting from its enclave status.\n\nThe police of Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau are located within the same office on the Parallelweg in Baarle-Hertog and are locally established. The local police officer of Baarle is sometimes called the 'Dirco'.\n\nThe fire services of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog merged into a single body on 1 January 2010. The joint fire service is formed by Dutch and Belgian volunteers and the station is located at C.A. Bodestraat 2 in Baarle-Nassau.\n\nThe village of Baarle is easily accessible by car via the two Dutch provincial roads N260, N639 and the Belgian regional road N119. The highways A58 in the Netherlands, E19 and E34 in Belgium also run near the village.\n\nLines from De Lijn:\n\nLines from Arriva:\n\nBaarle had two huge railway stations straddling the border, Baarle Grens and Weelde Station. The railway was established in 1867 and closed on 7 October 1934, running from spoorlijn Tilburg - Turnhout.\n\nThis line has now been converted into a 31-kilometre-long cycle path called \"Het Bels Lijntje\", that links the two villages.\n\nBaarle-Hertog has two schools: De Vlinder and De Horizon.\n\nBaarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog have a joint library with Belgian and Dutch staff.\n\nBaarle has several clubs and societies. Some have both Belgian and Dutch counterparts: for example, the football clubs of Gloria US (Netherlands) and KVV Dosko (Belgium). In other cases there is only one club in Baarle. They include:\n\nBoth villages have a community website that can be accessed through both baarle-nassau.nl and baarle-hertog.be . By using European subsidies for border projects, the first community website opened on 30 March 2002. The website was taken down in 2004, after a Dutch opinion poll found that baarle-nassau.nl/baarle-hertog.be was one of the worst municipal websites. A new community website opened on 8 July 2005. At the time of writing this article (2012), each of the two Baarles has a different website.\n\nThe village of Baarle has its own local broadcasting, Baarle's local broadcasting, also known as \"Stille Genieter\". In addition, there are still a number of regional broadcasters that are received in Baarle, Omroep Brabant (In Baarle-Hertog one receives digital TV via Telenet) and RTV (only available in the Belgian area).\n\nThe regional newspapers in Baarle are BN/De Stem, Brabants Dagblad and Gazet van Antwerpen. Baarle also has a weekly newspaper, Ons Weekblad.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166926", "title": "Fano resonance", "text": "In physics, a Fano resonance is a type of resonant scattering phenomenon that gives rise to an asymmetric line-shape. Interference between a background and a resonant scattering process produces the asymmetric line-shape. It is named after Italian-American physicist Ugo Fano, who in 1961 gave a theoretical explanation for the scattering line-shape of inelastic scattering of electrons from helium; however, Ettore Majorana was the first to discover this phenomenon. Because it is a general wave phenomenon, examples can be found across many areas of physics and engineering.\n\nThe explanation of the Fano line-shape first appeared in the context of inelastic electron scattering by helium and autoionization. The incident electron doubly excites the atom to the formula_1 state, a sort of shape resonance. The doubly excited atom spontaneously decays by ejecting one of the excited electrons. Fano showed that interference between the amplitude to simply scatter the incident electron and the amplitude to scatter via autoionization creates an asymmetric scattering line-shape around the autoionization energy with a line-width very close to the inverse of the autoionization lifetime.\n\nThe Fano resonance line-shape is due to interference between two scattering amplitudes, one due to scattering within a continuum of states (the background process) and the second due to an excitation of a discrete state (the resonant process). The energy of the resonant state must lie in the energy range of the continuum (background) states for the effect to occur. Near the resonant energy, the background scattering amplitude typically varies slowly with energy while the resonant scattering amplitude changes both in magnitude and phase quickly. It is this variation that creates the asymmetric profile. \n\nFor energies far from the resonant energy the background scattering process dominates. Within formula_2 of the resonant energy, the phase of the resonant scattering amplitude changes by formula_3. It is this rapid variation in phase that creates the asymmetric line-shape.\n\nFano showed that the total scattering cross-section formula_4 assumes the following form,\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere formula_6 describes the line width of the resonant energy and q, the Fano parameter, measures the ratio of resonant scattering to the direct (background) scattering amplitude. (This is consistent with the interpretation within the Feshbach\u2013Fano partitioning theory.) In the case the direct scattering amplitude vanishes, the q parameter becomes zero and the Fano formula boils down to the usual Breit\u2013Wigner (Lorentzian) formula:\n\nformula_7\n\nExamples of Fano resonances can be found in atomic physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, circuits, microwave engineering, nonlinear optics, nanophotonics, magnetic metamaterials, and in mechanical waves. \n\nFano can be observed with photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166928", "title": "Opodo", "text": "Opodo is an online travel agency which offers deals in regular and charter flights, low-cost airlines, hotels, cruises, car rental, dynamic packages, holiday packages and travel insurance.

Specifically, it aggregates multiple channels of information including voice and data across a single shared access link to a carrier or service provider PoP (Point of Presence). The access link may be a T1 line, a DSL connection, a cable (CATV) network, a broadband wireless link, or a metro-Ethernet connection.\n\nAt the PoP, the customer's aggregated information is typically directed into an Add-drop multiplexer or an MSPP (multiservice provisioning platform), which are complex and expensive devices that sit between customers and the core network. They manage traffic streams coming from customers and forward those streams to the PSTN (voice) or appropriate wide area networks (ATM, frame relay, or the Internet).\n\nAn IAD is sometimes installed by the service provider to which a customer wishes to connect. This allows the service provider to control the features of the access link and manage its operation during use. Competitive service providers are now offering access services over a variety of access technologies, including wireless optical (i.e., Terabeam) and metro-Ethernet networks. Old telco protocols and transport methods (T1 lines and time-division multiplexing) are replaced with access methods that are appropriate for the underlying transport. Because of this, the provider will usually specify an appropriate IAD or install an IAD.\n\nSIAD will aggregate its IP data traffic and GSM ATM traffic at the cellsite passing it along to the multi-service routers sitting in front of mobile switching center (MSC). \nIt will aggregate the cell site traffic and forward to the MSN.\n\nAn Integrated Access Device (or IAD) allows customers to continue using their legacy TDM voice equipment (PBX, Channel Bank, etc...) without the need to invest in new Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capable equipment. This also allows customers in locations where legacy TDM services are no longer available to delay expensive equipment upgrades required to move to a pure Voice over IP (VoIP) solution. \n\nThere are other cost saving benefits of moving to an Integrated Access Device (or IAD) since a Primary Rate Interface (PRI) which is typically required for Private Branch Exchange (PBX) equipment requires 23 voice (bearer) channels and 1 signaling (data) channel. By purchasing an IAD instead and connecting to a VoIP service provider, customers can purchase only the number of voice channels that are actually required at their location. Since the VoIP service allows internet access to be used for both voice and data, moving to a VoIP solution allows customers to remove the local access charges associated with the T1 local loop that was required to deliver the legacy PRI service. This allows customers to realize a significant cost savings by removing unused voice channels and access costs. Some companies estimate a 30%\u201375% cost savings can be realized by moving to VoIP. \n\nAnother benefit in moving to a VoIP solution over TDM is that additional security can be added to the voice service since MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS or Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections can be used for voice access. This is especially important in the legal and healthcare industry where confidential information is routinely shared during phone calls. \n\nThe only caveats to sharing Voice and data on the same connection are that proper Quality of Service (QoS) must be added to the circuit to ensure that the voice traffic takes priority over the data traffic and that enough bandwidth is available for the number of sessions (AKA concurrent call paths, channels, etc..) of voice service that are needed at the site. A good rule of thumb (and to make for easy math) for a home phone quality (G.711) VoIP codec is to assume 100 kbit/s per session multiplied by the number of sessions required at the location. For example 10 sessions of VoIP would require 1 Mbit/s of available bandwidth and 1 Mbit/s of premium QOS to ensure a quality call experience.\n"}, {"id": "2166952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166952", "title": "AAA (computer security)", "text": "AAA refers to Authentication, Authorization and Accounting.

For example, Diameter uses the URI scheme AAA, which stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting, and the Diameter-based Protocol AAAS, which stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting with Secure Transport. These protocols were defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 6733 and are intended to provide an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications, such as network access or IP mobility in both local and roaming situations.\n\nWhile the term AAA has been used in such a narrow context, the concept of \"AAA\" is more widely used within the industry.

It operated in the United Kingdom between 29 October 1925 and 31 December 1995, when the Corps' civilian volunteers were stood down (ROC headquarters staff at RAF Bentley Priory stood down on 31 March 1996). Composed mainly of civilian spare-time volunteers, ROC personnel wore a Royal Air Force (RAF) style uniform and latterly came under the administrative control of RAF Strike Command and the operational control of the Home Office. Civilian volunteers were trained and administered by a small cadre of professional full-time officers under the command of the Commandant Royal Observer Corps; latterly a serving RAF Air Commodore.\n\nIn 1925, following a Defence Committee initiative undertaken the previous year, the formation of an RAF command concerning the Air Defence of Great Britain led to the provision of a \"Raid Reporting System\", itself delegated to a sub-committee consisting of representatives from the Air Ministry, Home Office and the General Post Office. This \"Raid Reporting System\" was to provide for the visual detection, identification, tracking and reporting of aircraft over Great Britain, and was eventually to become known as the Observer Corps. The Observer Corps was subsequently awarded the title Royal by His Majesty King George VI in April 1941, in recognition of service carried out by Observer Corps personnel during the Battle of Britain.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the Second World War, the ROC continued to complement and at times replace the \"Chain Home\" defensive radar system by undertaking an inland aircraft tracking and reporting function, while \"Chain Home\" provided a predominantly coastal, long-range tracking and reporting system. With the advent of the Cold War, the ROC continued in its primary role of aircraft recognition and reporting, and in 1955 was allocated the additional task of detecting and reporting nuclear explosions and associated fall-out. By 1965, thanks to advances in (radar) technology, most roles and responsibilities relating to aircraft had been withdrawn and the ROC assumed the role of field force for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO); a role which the ROC continued until the early 1990s and the cessation of the Cold War.\n\nBy the late 1980s the ROC comprised 69 professional full-time officers, approximately 10,500 civilian spare-time volunteers, and over 100 Ministry of Defence (MoD) civilian support staff. At HQROC (RAF Bentley Priory), over a dozen full-time secretarial, clerical and other administrative staff were present. Each of the five Area HQs were staffed by a clerical officer and a typist, and each of the 25 Group HQs were staffed by a clerical officer, typist and handyperson. (Many MoD civilian support staff were also civilian spare-time volunteers.)\n\nFollowing the UK Government's \"Options for Change\" defence spending review in 1990, the vast majority of the civilian spare-time volunteers were stood down on 30 September 1991, with the remainder being stood down on 31 December 1995. The closure of HQROC on 31 March 1996 and redeployment of those few remaining HQROC staff marked the disbandment of the ROC after over 70 years of service.\n\nThe ROC can trace its roots to the First World War and the requirement for a warning system to bolster UK defences, predominantly over south east England, against bombing raids by Zeppelin airships of the German Empire's Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte. A system of observation posts and observers was organised, with a network of approximately 200 posts established in strategic areas. Initially these posts were manned by British Army personnel, who were in turn replaced by Special (Police) Constables, and posts were coordinated on an area basis with telephone communications provided between themselves and their associated anti-aircraft defences.\n\nThroughout 1917 Germany began to deploy increasing numbers of fixed-wing bombers, with the result that the number of airship raids decreased rapidly in favour of raids by such aircraft. In response to this new threat, Major General Edward Bailey Ashmore, a Royal Flying Corps pilot who later commanded an artillery division in Belgium, was appointed to devise an improved system of detection, communication and control. The system, called the \"Metropolitan Observation Service\", encompassed the London Air Defence Area and later extended eastwards towards the Kentish and Essex coasts.\n\nThe Metropolitan Observation Service met with some success and although not fully operational until the late summer of 1918 (the last German bombing raid taking place on 19 May 1918), the lessons learned were to prove invaluable for future developments in the field of aircraft observation, identification and reporting. Major General E B Ashmore is often considered to have been the founder of what would eventually become the Royal Observer Corps.\nFollowing the Armistice in 1918, it had been intended that the knowledge, experience and skills gained by the Metropolitan Observation Service during the First World War would be maintained for the future security of the nation. However, by the end of 1920, the observation-post networks and their associated anti-aircraft hardware had been decommissioned, and in 1922 the responsibility for air defence was transferred from the War Office (responsible for the army) to the Air Ministry.\n\nFollowing this transfer, Major General Ashmore, who had been responsible for air defence during World War\u00a0I, reported to a new Air Raid Precautions (ARP) committee, established in January 1924. In areas surrounding Romney Marsh and the Weald a series of trials were undertaken to develop a \"Raid Reporting System\" which would employ an optimum arrangement of observation posts and associated control-centres. During 1925 these trials were further extended to cover parts of the counties of Essex and Hampshire, and by October a proven \"modus operandi\" had been developed for a new organisation to be known as the Observer Corps, which was established on 29 October 1925.\n\nWithin a year four \"groups\" operated in South East England, covering much of Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and Essex, with the intention that a total of eighteen groups would cover the whole of Great Britain. The system required cooperation between and the participation of the RAF, the army, the British police forces and the General Post Office (GPO). (The GPO at that time operated Britain's national telecommunications system.) In January 1926 county police constabularies recruited observers as special constables, and each observation post was manned by a sergeant and six special constables. Recruits were spare-time volunteers who received neither pay, uniform, nor allowances. Individual volunteers purchased the only distinguishing insignia, Observer Corps lapel badges, at their own expense.\n\nIn 1929 the control of the Observer Corps passed from the county police forces to the Air Ministry, although Chief Constables retained responsibility for personnel and recruitment matters. 1 March 1929 saw the establishment of the new \"Headquarters of the Observer Corps\" at Hillingdon House, RAF Uxbridge in the west of London, and Air Commodore Edward A D Masterman CB CMG CBE AFC RAF (Rtd) was appointed as the first commandant of the Observer Corps. \"Air Cdre\" Masterman held this appointment until his retirement on 1 March 1936, and was succeeded by Air Commodore Alfred Warrington-Morris CG CMG OBE AFC RAF (Rtd), who would lead the Observer Corps through the critical period during the Second World War which saw the RAF emerge bruised but victorious following the Battle of Britain of 1940.\n\nDuring the 1930s the number of groups increased until by 1936, England had a full coverage of observation posts south-east of a line between Flamborough Head in Yorkshire and Poole Harbour in Dorset. (In 1936 the Headquarters of the Observer Corps relocated from RAF Uxbridge to RAF Bentley Priory in north-west London). By 1939 a system of observation posts covered practically the whole of Great Britain, with the western parts of Wales and Scotland together with England's West Country incorporated during 1940. The final group, Portree in the Western Isles, formed in 1941.\n\nAt the end of September 1938 the political crisis which culminated in the Munich Agreement had led to the Observer Corps being mobilised for a period of one week. This single act proved to be invaluable as it highlighted a number of organisational and technical shortcomings, and provided the impetus for the development of solutions to resolve these. A series of exercises held throughout 1939 provided opportunities for the fine tuning of improvements made to command and control functions. Operational procedures would continue to evolve throughout the war, a process facilitated by the enthusiasm, dedication and professionalism which volunteer members, coming from every walk of life, brought with them to the Observer Corps.\n\nAt this time the only uniform items issued to Observer Corps personnel were steel helmets bearing the stenciled letters 'O C', together with blue/white (vertically striped) armbands bearing the same. Both items of equipment were similar in style to those issued to members of the civil defence emergency services, including the Auxiliary Fire Service ('AFS') and Air Raid Precautions ('ARP'). With their status having previously been that of Special Constable, it was ironic that the initial batch of helmets issued to Observer Corps members were the same as those issued to Police forces; black in colour with the word 'POLICE' stencilled in white. (This led some Observer Corps members to simply scratch off the stencilled letters P, L, I, and E, to leave letters O and C remaining). High quality Royal Navy-issue binoculars were issued to observers, whose observation posts often consisted of nothing more than a wooden garden shed located next to a telegraph pole, this arrangement enabling a telecommunications link to be established with a control centre, often via a manual switchboard at local telephone exchange.\n\nThese 'garden shed' style observation posts were eventually replaced by more substantial brick-built structures, protected by sandbags, which due to their often having been constructed by Observer Corps personnel themselves meant that no two posts were identical. Observation posts were located in open playing fields, hilltops or cliff edges and, particularly in urban areas, on the rooftops of public buildings and factories. Purpose-built observation posts introduced later were usually two-storey structures, constructed of brick or concrete with an open-topped observation platform above a small crew rest area. (These 1940s-era posts are sometimes incorrectly referred to as 'Orlit' posts; this term is correctly associated with 1950s-era, pre-cast concrete aircraft observation posts, manufactured by \"Orlit Ltd\").\n\nOn 24 August 1939 Chief Constables issued \"Mobilisation Notices\" to all members of the Observer Corps, with war being declared just ten days afterwards. From 3 September 1939, observation posts and control centres would be manned continuously until 12 May 1945, four days after VE Day.\n\nThe first months of the Second World War were known as the Phoney War, with little significant enemy aircraft activity over Great Britain. The Battle of Dunkirk commenced at the end of May 1940, with Allied troops cut off in retreat by the German Army in north-east France, resulting in the evacuation of British troops in Operation Dynamo. During this time the RAF lost a total of 944 aircraft, with half of these being fighter aircraft. Observer Corps posts in Kent and around the Thames estuary were able to play some part in plotting aircraft while they were over south east England. This was a useful period of exposure to war-time operations for Observer Corps personnel, and one which would provide invaluable experience.\n\nDespite it being crucial that armed service personnel could correctly identify the various types of allied and German aircraft operating in the skies above and around Great Britain, in 1939 aircraft recognition was not yet the highly developed skill it was to become in the Observer Corps. Other armed services regarded accurate aircraft identification as being almost impossible; observers, however, realised that skills in this area were deficient, and the profile of aircraft recognition was raised within the ranks of the Observer Corps. Aircraft recognition training material, consisting of aircraft silhouettes and other data, was introduced almost entirely under the auspices of the unofficial \"Observer Corps Club\". Only much later did this skill obtain official recognition, with the result that it eventually spread throughout the armed forces.\n\nAfter the Fall of France, the goal of Germany was to achieve air superiority over Great Britain by destroying RAF fighters, both in the air and on the ground, and by bombing aircraft manufacturing facilities. Winning the Battle of Britain, as it became known, was Germany's prerequisite in preparation for the invasion of Britain; Operation Sea Lion.\n\nThe British Chain Home radar defence system was able to warn of enemy aircraft approaching the British coast, but once having crossed the coastline the Observer Corps provided the only means of tracking their position. During the period from July to October 1940, the Observer Corps was at full stretch operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, plotting enemy aircraft and passing this essential information to RAF Fighter Command Groups and Sector Controls. (ROC personnel were deployed in two specific roles: Those in Class A were required to undertake 56 hours duty per week, while Class B personnel undertook up to 24 hours duty per week). The Battle of Britain also saw the introduction of the Blitz campaign and the shift of German bombing from airfields to cities. Again, the Observer Corps provided vital information which enabled timely air-raid warnings to be issued, thereby saving countless lives. The Blitz itself continued until early in the summer of 1941 and bombing continued, albeit on a reduced scale, until March 1945. The Observer Corps formed the cornerstone of Air Marshal Hugh Dowding's air defence system, who stated in a despatch following the Battle of Britain that: \n\nIt is important to note that at this time they (the Observer Corps) constituted the whole means of tracking enemy raids once they had crossed the coastline. Their work throughout was quite invaluable. Without it the air-raid warning systems could not have been operated and inland interceptions would rarely have been made.\n\nAs a result of their role during the Battle of Britain, in April 1941 the Observer Corps was granted the title \"Royal\" by King George VI, and the \"Royal Observer Corps\" (ROC) became a uniformed civil defence organisation administered by RAF Fighter Command. Also during that same year, in a change from the policy of the Observer Corps, the ROC undertook to recruit women personnel for the first time. Initially, the only uniforms provided were RAF overalls, (\"boiler suits\"), with an ROC breast badge, commonly referred to as the \"soup plate\" because of its shape and size. Standard issue RAF No.2 Battledress uniforms were issued in a rolling programme over the next two years. For the remainder of the war, the ROC would provide an essential part of Great Britain's air defences.\n\nIn 1944, during preparations for the invasion of France, (Operation Overlord), a request for volunteers from within the ranks of the ROC produced 1,094 highly qualified candidates, from which 796 were selected to perform aircraft recognition duties as Seaborne Observers.\n\nThese Seaborne Observers, under the command of Group Commandant C.G. Cooke, undertook specialist training at the Royal Bath Hotel, Bournemouth, prior to being temporarily seconded to the Royal Navy with the rank of Petty Officer (Aircraft Identifier). The Seaborne Observers continued to wear their ROC uniform, but in addition wore a \"SEABORNE\" shoulder flash and Royal Navy brassard bearing the letters \"RN\". During the D-day landings, two Seaborne Observers were allocated to all participating US Navy vessels and Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships. The Seaborne Observers assumed control of each ship's anti aircraft batteries with the intention of reducing the previously high incidence of \"friendly fire\" (\"collateral damage\") between allied vessels and allied aircraft. The success of the Seaborne Observers in undertaking this role can be measured by a signal sent from Wing Commander P.B. Lucas, Air Staff Officer, who stated that:\n\nThe general impression amongst the Spitfire wings, covering our land and naval forces over and off the beach-head, appears to be that in the majority of cases the fire has come from British Navy warships and not from the merchant ships. Indeed I personally have yet to hear a single pilot report that a merchant vessel had opened fire on him\n\nDuring Operation Overlord a total of two Seaborne Observers lost their lives, several more were injured and twenty two survived their ships being sunk. In addition, ten Seaborne Observers were mentioned in despatches. The deployment of Seaborne Observers was regarded as an unqualified success and in recognition for their contribution to the success of the landings, King George Vl approved the permanent wearing of the SEABORNE shoulder flash on the ROC uniforms of those individuals who had taken part. Following the invasion, Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory wrote a message which was circulated to all ROC personnel:\n\nSeaborne Observers remain the only members of the ROC whose service during World War II entitles them to wear the HM Armed Forces Veterans Badge, their qualifying for such resulting from the approximately ten-week period of secondment to the Royal Navy. (The ROC itself was never a component of HM Armed Forces; ROC members being non-combatants during wartime with the exception of full-time officers who could be armed and therefore legally classed as combatants). A Seaborne Observers' Association exists with Air Vice Marshal George Black CB OBE AFC RAF (Rtd), a former Commandant ROC, acting as Honorary President.\n\nIntelligence reports detailing the threat posed by Germany's flying bombs resulted in the instigation of \"Operation Totter\", whereby ROC posts would fire 'Snowflake' illuminating rocket flares in order to alert RAF fighters to the presence of V-1 flying bombs. Observers at the coastal post of Dymchurch identified the very first of these weapons and within seconds of their report the defences were in action.\n\nThis new weapon gave the ROC much additional work, both at posts and control centres. RAF fighter controllers temporarily moved their radio equipment into the operations rooms of ROC control centres at Horsham and Maidstone in order to direct fighters to intercept V-1 flying bombs using information displayed on ROC plotting tables. Critics who had earlier claimed that the ROC would be unable to assist the new fast-flying Gloster Meteor jet aircraft were answered when these aircraft, on their first operational combat sorties to intercept V-1s, were controlled entirely using ROC derived information. The optimism shown by the then Commandant ROC, Air Cdre Crerar, that the ROC would cope with this new technology was vindicated.\n\nThe first V1 over London is credited as spotted by Sydney Fenton of the ROC.\n\nThe headquarters of each ROC \"Group\" operated from a control \"Centre\", responsible for and controlled between 30 and 40 observation \"Posts\", each of which would be some 10\u00a0km to 20\u00a0km from its neighbour. By 1945 there were 40 centres covering Great Britain, controlling in total more than 1,500 posts. (The ROC did not operate in Northern Ireland until 1954).\n\nIn order to monitor aircraft, observers used a simple but effective mechanical tracking device. Where the approximate height of an aircraft is known it becomes possible, by using a horizontal bearing and a vertical angle taken from a known point, to calculate the approximate position of that aircraft. Posts were equipped with a mechanical sighting Post Instrument plotter consisting of a sighting system over a map grid. After setting the instrument with the aircraft's approximate height, the observer would align a sighting bar with the aircraft. This bar was mechanically connected to a vertical pointer which would indicate the approximate position of the aircraft on the map grid. Observers would report the map coordinates, height, time, sector clock code and number of aircraft for each sighting to the aircraft \"Plotters\" located at the Centre. Positioned around a large table map, plotters would wear headsets to enable a constant communications link to be maintained with their allocated \"Cluster\" of posts, usually three in number.\n\nThe plotting table consisted of a large map with grid squares and posts being marked. Counters were placed on the map at the reported aircraft's position, each counter indicating the height and number of aircraft, and a colour-coded system was used to indicated the time of observation in 5-minute segments. The table was surrounded by plotters, responsible for communicating with their allocated cluster of posts. Over time the track of aircraft could be traced, with the system of colour-coding enabling the extrapolation of tracks and the removal of time expired (historical) data. From 1942, \"long-range boards\" were introduced into centre operations rooms, with \"Tellers\" communicating with neighbouring ROC groups in order to handover details of inbound and outbound aircraft tracks as they were plotted on this map.\n\nSpecific duties in the centre operations room included those undertaken by:\n\nPerhaps the most unusual ROC post location was No.17 Group (Watford) Easy-4 Windsor Post, nestling between the battlements and chimneys on the top of Windsor Castle's Brunswick Tower. Reporting for duty through the castle gates, many newly appointed ROC Group Officers were caught unawares when the castle Guardsmen in their sentry boxes snapped smartly to attention and presented arms. Observers frequently encountered King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Princesses, (Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret), in the castle grounds, where they would often make a point of stopping to enquire as to ROC activities.\n\nOn one memorable occasion the observers on duty received a one-minute advance warning from a royal footman that they were about to receive a royal visit. A few minutes later, the King and Queen, together with the teenage Princess Elizabeth, climbed up the steep ladder and joined the observers on the darkened roof-top while a major V-1 flying bomb attack was taking place over London. The royal visitors stayed for over an hour, asking technical questions and peering through binoculars at the unfolding aerial battle. Prior to departing, the royal party autographed the post Duty Log. The following evening, the royal party again appeared and on this occasion stayed for a longer period, although there was little aerial activity due to poor weather.\n\nIn the early 1960s, when the nuclear reporting role building programme was in full swing, the ROC post at Windsor relocated to the cellar beneath the Brunswick Tower and a partial monitoring room was excavated under the garden in front of the tower's base. The BPI (Bomb Power Indicator) and FSM (Fixed Survey Meter) instrument fittings on the lawn were clearly visible to the many tourists visiting the castle, although few would have realised their significance. The GZI (Ground Zero Indicator) was mounted on top of the tower's battlements involving an exhausting climb of several hundred circular stone steps and 400 feet in each direction. The observers at the Windsor post were unique in the country in not having to provide their own food during exercises. Instead, they received hot meals, brought by royal footman, from the castle kitchens. Twelve months after the ROC post was closed, the Brunswick Tower was the starting point and seat of the 1992 Windsor Castle fire and was substantially damaged.\n\nThe ROC provided an additional and highly useful function to the war-time UK Government by providing a plausible cover story for a number of covert war-time operations. Up to twenty highly secret electronic warfare units and Y-stations were established across the UK, with their associated scientists, technicians and engineers being dressed in Royal Observer Corps uniforms so as to avoid arousing any suspicion while entering and leaving Royal Air Force, Army, Royal Navy and other MoD establishments.\n\nThroughout the Second World War, ROC personnel were paid expenses and allowances in cash via their Group HQ and several Deputy Group Commandants discovered that they had up to one hundred additional observers appearing on their staff roll, with each additional observer being seen to receiving higher than normal allowances, despite these individuals having never reported for duty as members of the Royal Observer Corps. \n\nA notable example of one such cover story involving the ROC is that which took place at RAF Little Rissington, where a series of tunnels were excavated during the 1940s. RAF Little Rissington forces personnel and local residents were informed that this activity was associated with an ROC unit, which was indeed seen to be manned by individuals wearing ROC uniforms. The ROC however had no knowledge of the existence of this supposed ROC facility until many years after the war had drawn to a close. \n\nThe true nature of the activities of these \"Ghost\" ROC personnel remains \"classified information\", with public access to related documents being denied until 2045.\n\nOn 12 May 1945, when it was confirmed that the Luftwaffe had ceased combat operations, the ROC stood down. In recognition of the contribution made by ROC personnel in the Allied victory, the Air Ministry held a massed RAF rally and air display at RAF North Weald, in Essex, from Saturday 23 to Monday 25 June 1945. Over 2,000 ROC personnel were invited to attend, with at least two observers from each ROC facility representing their respective post or centre. As part of the event, the new ensign of the ROC (a Royal Air Force Ensign, \"defaced\" with the ROC badge in the \"fly\" in place of the RAF roundel \u2013 a design approved by King George VI), was dedicated at a special service.\n\nOn the day of the dedication of the ensign, (Sunday 24th), the approximately 2,000 observers present undertook the first ever uniformed ROC march-past to the accompaniment of the RAF Band, with the Under-Secretary of State for Air, Lord Beatty, taking the salute. The parade then formed into a huge square and the ROC Ensign was presented by Lord Beatty. The Ensign was borne from the drumhead by Observer Lieutenant Pollock, VC. During the parade, Observer Lieutenant Pollock carried the Ensign, flanked by two senior NCOs, at the head of the massed contingent of observers. A film record of these events is held in the archives at the Imperial War Museum. However, in a matter of only a few months, the ROC would again be called upon to meet the challenges posed by a new threat: the Cold War.\n\nIn September 1947, over a year after VE Day, the ROC held the first of a series of small scale exercises in southern England, which included for the first time substantial numbers of jet aircraft, principally in the form of the Gloster Meteor. The following year the first large scale exercise took place over a four-day period; in the latter half of which radar was used as the sole means of monitoring and controlling participating aircraft. By the mid-1950s, the greater speeds and altitudes attained by jet aircraft combined with the improved performance of radar led to a reduced requirement on the part of the RAF for the services of the ROC in tracking aircraft. However, to compensate for a reduced role with regard to aircraft, an additional role for the ROC, in the form of defending against the effects of nuclear weapons, was announced in June 1955. The first significant exercise undertaken by the ROC involving a simulated nuclear attack took place during 1956, and by the following year the British Government had concluded that the combination of a risk of nuclear attack and a need for a nuclear deterrent would be the overriding considerations which would shape UK defence policy. With that view firmly in place, any pretence that an aircraft recognition and reporting role for the ROC would continue all but disappeared.\n\nIn 1957, the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) was established under Home Office control. It was intended that the UKWMO would provide both civil and military authorities in the UK with essential information during a nuclear attack, with the ROC providing primary data on the position and magnitude of atomic weapons detonated during any such attack. This data would be used by the UKWMO, in conjunction with weather information provided by the Meteorological Office, to produce a forecast of radioactive\u00a0fallout. Fallout would be monitored as and where it occurred, with its actual location and strength mapped using data obtained from instrumentation at ROC posts. Such information when combined with \"ROCMet\", (data concerning actual wind speed and direction obtained from cluster \"Master Posts\" equipped with wind anemometers and other basic meteorological instruments), would permit the dissemination of accurate forecasts predicting the distribution and strength of nuclear fallout.\n\nIn 1962, the forty ROC Groups were reorganised and reduced in number to thirty-one, with a further reduction to twenty-five taking place in 1968. Service age limits of 16 to 65 were introduced, with service after the age of 65 only occurring where replacements could not be recruited, subject to annual review, and where appropriate medical certificates could be provided. (Some individuals acting as wartime \"post\" observers had served well into their seventies and eighties, although wartime \"centre\" observers had been forced to retire at fifty.)\n\nTo enable the ROC to operate in a nuclear environment, changes were necessary to both centres and posts in order to provide protection against blast effects and radiation from nuclear bursts. It would also now be necessary for control centres and observation posts to be occupied for a period of between seven and twenty-one days following any nuclear event. Between 1958 and 1968 a countrywide building programme resulted in a network of 1,563 underground monitoring posts, approximately eight miles apart, distributed throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at an estimated cost of almost \u00a35,000 each. The posts were excavated to a depth of twenty five feet, a monocoque reinforced concrete building was cast and bitumen tanked (or waterproofed), before the whole structure was covered by a compacted soil mound. Entry was facilitated by a steel ladder in a vertical shaft leading to a single room, providing accommodation for three observers to live and work, with a separate toilet compartment with chemical closet. Air was circulated from grilled ventilators at both ends of the post and electricity was provided by a crated 12\u00a0volt lead\u2013acid battery, charged occasionally by a portable petrol electric generator. New instrumentation detected the peak overpressure from any nuclear burst, together with photographic indications of the burst location and size, plus resulting levels of radiation. Conditions in these spartan posts were cramped, cold, and in some cases damp.\n\nROC centres were renamed as \"Controls\" and provided with bomb proof nuclear protected buildings. A small number of these were converted from suitable pre-existing Second World War anti-aircraft operations rooms (AAORs), with the remainder specially constructed as above ground or semi-sunk blockhouse buildings. These were constructed to a standard layout, dependent upon the subsoil composition at the construction site. Controls provided living and operational accommodation for up to a hundred observers and UKWMO warning teams. Included in the centre layout were male and female dormitories, kitchen and canteen provision, life support systems and decontamination facilities, a communications centre and a split level central operations room with balcony positions.\n\nIn the vicinity of each control was a compact, brick built shack called the \"Radiac Store\", which housed approximately 20 nuclear radiation sources in the form of milled metal discs. These discs, with strengths of 0.5 r\u00f6ntgen, 1 r\u00f6ntgen, 5 r\u00f6ntgens and 10 r\u00f6ntgens, were securely stored in lead-lined containers. Discs had to be audited monthly which entailed an ROC officer physically counting the discs into the palm of their bare hands, with the results being recorded in a log book. (This task was usually achieved with a degree of haste). Discs were used to calibrate and check the stocks of radiac instruments and for simulated live-training using such instruments. In practice, Health and Safety at Work regulations introduced in the 1970s resulted in radioactive sources being rarely if ever used, and as a result they seldom left the radiac store. Discs were finally withdrawn from service and returned to Aldermaston during the mid-1980s, with the last exercise involving such live radiation sources taking place at RAF West Raynham in 1980, during the annual ROC summer training camp.\n\nDuring 1958, RAF Fighter Command expressed a desire to obtain data similar to that provided by the ROC in the event of a nuclear attack, specifically that concerning the location of nuclear bursts and the resulting nuclear fallout. The Air Defence Commander at the Air Defence Operations Centre, (ADOC), RAF Bentley Priory, in order to ensure continued operations by RAF mobile and static units, wished to use such data in determining which UK airfields, (both civil and military), had been subject to blast damage and/or exposed to any subsequent nuclear fallout.\n\nDue to issues surrounding RAF personnel shortages and training restrictions, HQ Fighter Command formally requested that HQROC assist in providing suitably qualified ROC personnel to staff the Fallout Reporting Sections at both the ADOC and at Fighter Command's Sector Operations Centres, (SOCs). Apart from wartime ROC/RAF Liaison Officers, this was to be the first occasion whereby ROC personnel would undertake their duties within a wholly military operational environment. In case of the ADOC at RAF Bentley Priory, sixteen ROC personnel were required to staff the Fallout Reporting Section, with the operation itself consisting of marking the position of nuclear bursts, and plotting both the reported and predicted path of fallout onto a large, vertical, transparent (perspex) map display. (Two Observers working at the rear of the display would plot and update data by writing in 'reverse', thereby enabling an unobstructed view of the front of display). Actual reports of fallout were drawn onto initial templates which, when combined with meteorological forecasts, were used to extrapolate the predicted path and intensity of the fallout. This system enabled initial and subsequent predictions of fallout to be drawn, together with identifying those areas actually being affected.\n\nDuring October 1958, \"Exercise Nightbird\", a joint air defence and nuclear fallout exercise, saw ROC personnel undertaking operational duties at the ADOC for the first time. Subsequently, operational RAF Command and Group HQs in the UK received nuclear fallout information over 2 broadcast circuits from the ADOC, with Fallout Reporting Section map displays at each site being updated by local ROC Special Duties Teams. This system of Fallout Reporting Sections was enhanced further when nuclear burst and fallout data was distributed by ROC Group HQs directly to what became formally designated as ROC \"Nuclear Reporting Cells\" (NRC). Nuclear Reporting Cells would go on to be located within several major armed forces HQ throughout the UK, with ROC personnel being responsible for providing the Army, Royal Navy and RAF with comprehensive visual displays and interpretation of data provided by ROC controls.\n\nAs a result of such developments taking place throughout the 1970s, a third category of Observer was introduced in addition to Post Observer and Control Observer; that of NRC Observer. The role of NRC Observer combined basic ROC training with specialist scientific skills and training normally reserved for UKWMO warning teams. Similarly, a higher level of security clearance was required by those ROC personnel acting as NRC Observers.\n\nSeveral Cold War-era Government facilities which were also home to NRCs are maintained as museums and are open to the public, including those at Kelvedon Hatch, Hack Green, Dover Castle and Anstruther.\n\n\n\n\nInitially, communications between posts and controls were made using former Army-issue head-and-breast communication sets via above-ground telephone lines, these being manually switched by telephone engineers prior to use. Army head-and-breast sets were replaced in 1964 by metal housed \"Teletalk\" units which only permitted one-way communications when the push-to-talk switch was depressed. The Teletalk units also used manually switched telephone lines, but with integral transistorisation to boost transmission and reception power. In 1981 a new design of Teletalk (AD8010) was introduced by British Telecom together with underground, permanently wired, landline connections that were hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear bursts.\n\nPosts were organised in \"clusters\" of three, four or five posts, with a single post in each cluster designated as the \"Master Post\". To guard against the possibility of a cluster being disconnected from the parent control, master posts were provided with radio equipment capable of communicating with the parent control and up to three adjacent controls using separate radio frequencies.\n\nInter-group control-to-control exchange of burst and radiation data was initially via \"teller\" voice message using telephone lines between adjacent groups. In 1971 this method was replaced by punched tape data exchanges by telegraph teleprinters located in the communications centre. Between 1981 and 1985 the teleprinters were replaced with modern computerised AD9000 message switch equipment, operating over a permanent and EMP hardened landline network, permitting direct communications between groups nationally. In the late 1980s the manually operated PMBX switchboards were replaced with computerised direct dial SX2000 equipment.\nDuring the years immediately prior to the stand down of the ROC, trials were undertaken with the intention of providing monitoring posts with remotely operated above ground petrol generators to provide a constant electricity supply (a portable generator capable of producing both 12 V and 240 V(Yamaha EF1000) was supplied in small quantities to a number of groups), \"black\" heaters to provide a warmer environment and new sealed, recycling ventilators to allow air changes without requiring the post to be exposed to a contaminated air source.\n\nThe Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps was a Royal Air Force officer with the rank of Air Commodore. With only three exceptions, (two Navigators and one General Duties (Ground) Supply Branch officer), all Commandants ROC were RAF pilots with extensive service records and previous command appointments. Had an ROC officer been appointed to the post of Commandant ROC they would have held the rank of Observer Commodore, although no such appointment was ever made.\n\nThe ROC crest and cap badge depict a 16th-century soldier holding aloft a flaming torch while shielding his eyes with his free hand, as though looking towards a distant place or object. This central figure is encircled by a wreath of gilt laurel and surmounted by the Royal Crown, the motto being \"Forewarned is Forearmed\". Uniform tunic buttons, lapel badges and the reverse of the ROC Medal also depict the soldier in the same pose while standing beside a coastal signal fire or warning beacon, with a chain of lit beacons extending along the coastline into the far distance. (In this representation it was easy to imagine the figure looking out towards the next beacon in the chain). The symbol of the coast watcher has its origins in the Elizabethan era, where such individuals were organised and paid for by the County Sheriff to tend and light beacons to warn of approaching enemies, such as the Spanish Armada of that period.\n\nUnlike an Armed Services unit, (having a \"Regimental Colour\"), the ROC has, in place of such, a \"Royal Banner\". Presented by HM the Queen, both in 1966 and 1991, these were laid up in 1991, (St Clement Danes), and 1995, (RAF Cranwell), respectively. Unusually, the Imperial State Crown and St Edward's Crown appear together. (The \"ROC Ensign\", first authorised in 1945, differs from the \"ROC Royal Banner\" in that from 1952, following the accession of HM Queen Elizabeth II, the ROC badge was thenceforth ensigned with the St Edward's Crown). During October 2015, the Royal Banner at RAF Cranwell was temporarily 'Lodged-Out' to RAF Northolt, prior to being laid up at St Clement Danes Church, where it replaced the 1966 Banner.\n\nWhen the ROC was first issued with RAF style uniforms in 1941, the RAF was able to provide the majority of the uniform items but held insufficient stocks of RAF blue berets. However, at that time the Army held a surplus of black Royal Tank Regiment berets, therefore the ROC was initially issued with black berets, which remained part of the ROC uniform only until a manufacturer was able to produce the prescribed midnight blue berets, which then remained part of the ROC uniform throughout its history. There was a similar shortage of both Sergeant and Corporal stripes. However, there existed a large surplus of rank badges destined for the quasi-military \"Royal Canadian (Volunteer) Storekeeper Corps\" who served in UK dockside warehouses during the Second World War. These badges, displaying horizontal bars within a wreath of laurel leaves, were adopted for the ROC, with \"Chief Storekeeper\" becoming \"Chief Observer\" and \"Leading Storekeeper\" becoming \"Leading Observer\". The four bar rank of \"Master Storekeeper\" was discounted initially, but was again under consideration in 1990 as an RAF Warrant Officer equivalent rank styled \"Master Observer\"; intended to act as dedicated assistants to Crew, Group and NRC officers. However, the decision on whether to introduce the rank of Master Observer was overtaken by the standing down announcement. (The surplus rank badges destined for the Royal Canadian (Volunteer) Storekeeper Corps were also used by the United States' Civilian Technical Corps, who were based in the UK during the Second World War).\n\nMany observers joined the ROC after service in other armed forces. Aircrew brevets from the RAF, Army Air Corps and Royal Naval Air Service were permitted to be worn on ROC uniforms, along with any medal ribbons from British or British Empire (later Commonwealth) countries. Other permitted badges were specialist \"trade\" badges such as parachute brevets, marksman badges, radio operator badges, etc. The 796 volunteer observers who served on board Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships and US Navy vessels during the D-Day landings were permitted to wear the \"Seaborne\" shoulder flash for the remainder of their service with the ROC, including where promoted to officer ranks. A handful of Seaborne Observers remained in active service with the ROC when the majority of the spare-time volunteer members were stood down in 1991. (Several Seaborne Observers purportedly lied about their age in 1941 in order to qualify for special service duty).\n\nFrom 1977 the uncomfortable wartime-issue \"hairy mary\" RAF No.2 Battledress uniforms were replaced in a rolling programme with comfortable, modern zip-fronted 1972 pattern No.2 RAF uniforms, immediately christened as 'mothercare suits' due to the shapeless style of these loose fitting jackets. RAF-issue blue shirts with collars attached, black ties, practical woollen jerseys known as 'wooly and additionally, for post observers only, new style green overalls and blue nylon foul weather jackets and overtrousers were issued. Standard RAF footwear was issued to all ranks below that of officer and to all spare-time officers. (Full-time officers purchased footwear at their own expense). ROC stable belts incorporating the colours of the ROC Medal ribbon were authorised by the Commandant ROC and introduced in 1985 for male observers. These were introduced as an optional, non-issue item and were purchased at the individual's expense. Another optional self-purchase item were the RAF forage cap, also called the side hat, \"chip bag\" or \"cheese cutter\". In 1983, female members were granted permission to purchase and wear the WRAF hat in place of the beret.\n\nAll ROC ranks below that of Observer Officer were entitled to wear a \"Spitfire\" proficiency badge to mark success in the annual ROC \"Master Test\" examination. The first version of this test was introduced during the Second World War as a measure of competency in the field of aircraft recognition, with candidates required to correctly identify a set of aircraft silhouette cards in order to be judged proficient. (Results and names of those observers who had met the required standard were published at the rear of the ROC magazine). The insignia awarded to those who had been successful was a \"printed\" badge depicting a white Spitfire on blue/grey material. The test cards were later replaced by photographic slides projected onto a screen using a \"Flash Trainer\" projector. Between 1956 and 1966 the test became a mix of aircraft recognition and written answers to questions relating to the nuclear detection role. Latterly, the master test was a 100 question multiple-choice test, and separate specialist papers were provided for post and NRC observers.\n\nThe five levels of test result ranged from \"Failure\" to \"Basic Pass\" to \"Intermediate Pass\", a \"First Class Pass\" and finally \"Master Pass\". A score of 90% or above was required for the award of a \"Master Pass\". On the first occasion a \"Master Pass\" was achieved, a \"Blue Spitfire\" badge would be awarded, with each subsequent pass rated as a \"Blue Star\" badge until the fifth pass when a \"Red Spitfire\" badge replaced the combined \"Blue Spitfire and 3 Blue Stars\". After the award of the \"Red Spitfire\", each subsequent five master passes were awarded with a \"Red Star\" badge until the twenty fifth pass, when the combined \"Red Spitfire and 3 Red Stars\" were replaced with a \"Gold Spitfire\". (The \"Gold Spitfire\" badge was first introduced in 1988, although it could be awarded retrospectively).\n\nThe age limits of ROC service meant that in order to achieve the coveted \"Gold Spitfire and 3 Gold Stars\" a master level pass was required during almost every year of an observer's service, assuming having joined at the minimum age. As a result, very few \"Gold Spitfire\" badges were awarded, and yet fewer \"Gold Stars\".\n\nLatterly in 1987 it was announced that a First Class pass in the master test would be recognised by the award of a stand-alone blue star, for those observers who had not previously achieved a master pass and the award of a Spitfire badge.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, observers were employed by county police forces and qualified for the \"Special Constabulary Long Service Medal\" after nine years continuous service. However, following RAF Fighter Command assuming control of the ROC in 1939, this medal ceased to be awarded to members of the ROC.\n\nIn 1950, King George VI granted permission for the issue of a \"Royal Observer Corps Medal\" for twelve years continuous service. Each subsequent period of twelve years was recognised by the award of a clasp depicting a \"winged crown\" attached to the medal ribbon. Peace time service by full-time officers was calculated at a rate of 50% for qualifying years, thereby requiring up to twenty four years service to qualify for a medal or subsequent clasp. However, any war or part-time service previously undertaken by such individuals counted in full. \n\nThe medal ceased to be awarded when the ROC was stood down in December 1995.\n\nThe medal ribbon is a mix of pale blue, dark blue and silver vertical stripes, representing the pale blue of the daytime sky with a searchlight's beam in a night sky at the centre. A pattern which, together with additional outer stripes of dark blue, is repeated in the ROC stable belt.\n\nROC personnel who served for 1,080 days during the war qualified for the Defence Medal. The 796 members of the ROC temporarily enrolled in the Royal Navy for services afloat during the June 1944 Normandy landings qualified for the appropriate campaign medals. Most served for one or two months and were entitled to the France and Germany Star and the War Medal. Two members of the Corps were killed, one wounded and ten mentioned in despatches, and were additionally entitled to the 1939-1945 Star. A total of 235 of these D Day veterans went on to receive the ROC Medal.\n\nSeveral major war simulation exercises were held each year 2 x WARMON (Warning and Monitoring) one day UK exercises and the two-day INTEX (International exercise) along with other NATO countries.\n\nFour times a year minor and limited exercises called POSTEX were held on a stop \u2013 start basis across three evenings of a week, Monday to Wednesday. Realistic simulation material was provided for realtime simulations of a nuclear attack.\n\nApproximately every four or five years each group was subjected to a \"no notice\" and in depth \"OPEVAL\" assessment similar to an RAF \"TACEVAL\" or Tactical Evaluation, where a mixed team of UKWMO and ROC full-time staff would appear and evaluate all aspects of the group's planning and operations under realistic wartime conditions over a period of 48 hours.\n\nAfter the concept was first introduced in 1948 by the then Commandant ROC, (Air Cdre Percy Bernard, 5th Earl of Bandon), annual summer training camps were held to enable spare-time volunteers, while spending a week in uniform at an RAF station, to attend a series of lectures, training courses and social events. A series of six to eight training camps would be held annually, with approximately 500 to 600 spare-time observers attending each week. Ranks below those of officer would be accommodated in vacant barracks block accommodation, while officers would be accommodated in the station Officers' Mess. Vacant offices and aircraft hangars would be converted into temporary training facilities.\n\nA core-team of instructors, provided with pre-formatted lesson plans, would be drawn from those spare-time officers present, who in turn would be supervised by a team of up to nine full-time officers. Full-time officers would be present for the duration of the summer programme of training camps, one of which being appointed as \"Camp Entertainments Officer\"; organising events including social dances, visits to local places of interest and an end of camp grand raffle. On the last full day of each camp, a Cabinet Minister or senior RAF officer of the rank of Air Vice-Marshal or above would visit to inspect a Guard of Honour, tour the training facilities and address the assembled personnel.\n\nA typical camp's day-to-day programme would consist of:\n\nSunday \u2013 Afternoon arrival of junior officers and volunteer NCO instructors.\n\nMonday \u2013 Instructors spend day familiarising and rehearsing. Students arrive during afternoon. Formal evening opening assembly, (in uniform), followed by 'Meet and Greet' in the NAAFI club.\n\nTuesday \u2013 Morning parade. Lessons from 0900 to 1730, with one hour break for lunch. Evening free, with optional coach trips to local places of interest and entertainment venues.\n\nWednesday \u2013 Morning parade. Lessons from 0900 to 1200. Afternoon and evening free, with optional coach trips to local places of interest and entertainment venues.\n\nThursday \u2013 Morning parade. Lessons from 0900 to 1730, with one hour break for lunch. Evening free, with optional coach trips to local places of interest and entertainment venues.\n\nFriday \u2013 Morning parade followed by VIP visit; Guard of Honour, tour of training area and VIP address. Afternoon lessons followed by closing assembly and grand raffle. Evening farewell social dance in NAAFI Club.\n\nSaturday \u2013 Morning dispersal.\n\nInitially it was not difficult for RAF stations operating on a 'care and maintenance' basis or between squadron deployments to accommodate a seasonal influx of ROC personnel. During their first few years of operation, ROC annual summer training camps had even taken place entirely under canvas. In later years, reductions in RAF manpower resulted in there being vacant accommodation and training facilities at most RAF stations in the UK, including those home to front-line operational units such as RAF Scampton and RAF Waddington. The final camp venue at RAF Watton had actually closed in 1990 and was supported by a skeleton staff of caterers, stewards and RAF Regiment security patrols, all of which were drafted in from nearby RAF stations.\n\nThere were no camps held during 1966 and 1991, when up to 3,000 observers gathered instead for Royal Reviews and garden parties at RAF Bentley Priory. In 1986, and for the only time in the history of ROC annual summer training camps, the RAF was unable to provide an RAF station capable of providing the facilities and accommodation required. The ROC then took the unusual step of locating the camp at the Medical Faculty within Newcastle University, with observers being accommodated in student halls of residence. A temporary bar facility was added to the senior lecturers' dining room, which itself functioned as an officer's mess.\n\nUntil 1984 the camp training programme consisted of approximately twenty lessons, each concerned with distinct and unrelated subjects. From 1985 onwards, the training syllabus was reorganised as a series of five or six concentrated mini-courses concerned with specific subjects which observers would study throughout the entire week, thus permitting individual subjects to be taught in greater detail. Subjects included \"Techniques of Instruction\" (TOI), \"First Aid\", \"Triangulation, Transition to War\" (TTW) and \"Communications Management\". UKWMO \"Assistant Sector Controllers\" provided a 'Warning Officers' course for control observers, detailing the UKWMO Warning Team's role and responsibilities in the event of war.\n\nOn at least one occasion during the mid-1980s, ROC personnel were briefly called upon to resume their historic role in visually identifying aircraft for the purpose of air defence. The Royal Artillery, conducting exercises at the Otterburn Training Area involving the deployment of the \"Rapier\" surface-to-air missile, invited personnel from the ROC to assist Rapier crews with aircraft identification. The exercises involved both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft conducting simulated attacks on high-value ground targets, the defence of which was tasked to the Rapier crews. The high energy manoeuvres conducted by fixed-wing aircraft at low level meant that the task of identifying such targets as \"Hostile\" or \"Friendly\" proved to be extremely challenging.\n\nEarly versions of the Rapier missile system relied heavily upon the optical acquisition of targets and also suffered problems with the \"Identification Friend or Foe\" (IFF) system. The avoidance of \"friendly fire\" incidents required an advanced level of aircraft recognition skills on the part of Rapier crews; a skill which those ROC personnel selected to attend deftly demonstrated and in turn passed on to those Rapier crews to which they were assigned.\n\nOrganisations similar to the ROC were formed elsewhere during the Second World War, including the Ground Observer Corps, (USA), the Aircraft Identity Corps, (Canada), and the Volunteer Air Observers Corps, (Australia). However, unlike the Royal Observer Corps, most of these organisations had been disbanded by the end of the 1950s.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the Danish Home Guard also sought to develop an organisation with a similar role to that of the ROC. Links were formed by the ROC with the \"Luftmeldekorpset (LMK)\", the \"Danish Air Reporting Corps\", who also performed a similar nuclear warning role in Denmark whilst retaining the aircraft recognition role due to the proximity of Warsaw Pact countries. Aircraft recognition competitions between the LMK and ROC took place annually until 1991, despite the ROC no longer having an operational role of aircraft recognition. Honours remained roughly even over the history of the competitions, with the four-man ROC team taking the trophy in the final contest. Liaison visits to the LMKHQ proved popular, particularly as it was located in the basement of the main Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen, with the LMK mess having free lager piped direct from the factory above. (The LMK was disbanded in 2004).\n\nFollowing the 1990 defence spending review \"Options for Change\", the main field force of the ROC's monitoring post and group control personnel were stood down on 30 September 1991. The previous day, the original 1966 ROC Royal Banner was laid up at St Clement Danes Church, London, with attending ROC personnel conducting a slow-march, (\"Skywatch\" being the ROC regimental quick-march), while carrying the banner to its final resting place, where it remains on display. (A replacement banner had been presented previously by Queen Elizabeth II at a Royal Review of the ROC in July 1991). The ROC, along with the UKWMO, was officially disestablished following what was described by The Queen at the 1991 Royal Review as \"the end of the Cold War\". This move was linked to a Government press release which referred to \"possible future developments and improvements in automated nuclear explosion and fallout detection from remote sensors\".\n\nOf the remaining 170 full-time ROC uniformed and civilian staff, many were transferred to other appointments within the Ministry of Defence and other UK Government departments, some opted to take early retirement, however the majority were made redundant. The \"Senior Administration Officer\" (S Ad O) and \"Personnel Services Officer\" (P Serv O) at HQROC undertook an extensive campaign of arranging relocation or retirement courses for staff from all over the UK. The S Ad O and an Observer Lieutenant remained in post to administer the reduced ROC contingent under a revised RAF structure. A massive exercise in recalling instruments, equipment, furniture and stores from all monitoring posts and controls took place over a period of nine months, controlled by the HQROC Supply Officer. Arrangements were made with the Ministry of Defence and RAF Historical Branch to archive ROC files, documents and historical memorabilia at various locations across the country.\n\nOnly the Nuclear Reporting Cell (NRC) elements of the ROC remained in service which, working alongside major armed forces headquarters, themselves entered a new and highly uncertain phase. Reduced to fewer than 260 members, the 16 retained NRCs now found themselves tasked with the daunting challenge of providing a comprehensive Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare analysis and warning service for the Military Home Commands, on a reserve-manned basis as NBCCs but operating without the countrywide flow of data from posts and controls.\n\nThe removal of Home Office involvement in the ROC from 1991 onwards resulted in those \"Remnant Elements\" becoming effectively a single reserve \"Directly Administered Unit\" within RAF Strike Command (RAFSTC). For the final four years of its existence the role of Commandant ROC became a secondary appointment held by the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No. 11 Group RAF. All remaining members of the ROC were required to remove their original ROC Group designations from their RAF uniforms, and accept moves towards changes in conditions of service during any Transition-To-War (TTW) which would make them effectively members of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF), with protected rights. As a direct result, closer links were forged between the ROC and war-appointable flights of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR).\n\nDespite having successfully built upon the extensive NBC reporting trials, undertaken with the RAF Regiment, and meeting full NATO standards and evaluations (STANAGs and OPEVALs), the conclusion reached by the UK MoD was that retention of the ROC in its NBC Cell role was \"desirable, but not essential in the existing format\". As a consequence, the remaining part-time members of the ROC were stood down on 31 December 1995, following the laying-up ceremony conducted for the 1991 ROC Royal Banner in the Rotunda at RAF College Cranwell on 8 December 1995, where it remains on display alongside other stood-down Air Force units and squadrons which remain subject to possible future reactivation. Headquarters ROC at RAF Bentley Priory finally closed on 31 March 1996, after all administrative winding up tasks were completed. Assisted by the Senior ROC Officer (SROCO), Observer Commander N A Greig, MBE, the honour of being the last Commandant of the ROC fell to Air Commodore Martin K Widdowson RAF, who held the position jointly with his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of the newly combined No. 11/18 Group RAF.\n\nSeveral monitoring posts across the UK have since been bought or leased, re-equipped and opened to the public as museums. Some posts situated in scenic rural locations have proved popular with those seeking permanent locations for holiday caravans, i.e. the mostly intact Penrith monitoring post in the Carlisle group was sold at auction in April 2008 for \u00a3182,000 ($360,000 US).\n\nThe majority of control buildings have been sold into private ownership and demolished or converted to other uses, such as 17 Group Wrexham that is now a recording studio, 16 Group Shrewsbury is a veterinary hospital and 1 Group Maidstone is a solicitor's storage archive. Several others still remain, albeit for the most part abandoned and derelict. There are two notable exceptions. 20 Group York's semi-sunken control building that has been adopted by English Heritage as a museum of the ROC and its cold war activities, and is open to the public from Wednesday \u2013 Sundays from Easter until November, and Saturdays and Sundays from November onwards. 28 Group Dundee\u2019s control bunker is managed by 28 Group Observed (SCIO) and has been restored to its 1991 condition. Private tours can be arranged via the charity's website and facebook page. The York museum closed for several months during 2008, when an unknown mould was discovered in the data centre, but reopened in October after investigations showed the mould to be harmless. It was forced to close again in August 2015 for one month due to serious flooding after a prolonged period of heavy rain..\n\nRAF Bentley Priory, home of HQROC for the entire history of the \"Royal\" Observer Corps, closed in May 2008 and will be developed as a private hotel or luxury apartments, with the historic officers' mess rooms and a selection of ROC items retained as a public museum. With effect from July 2011, the ROC Museum, Winchester, assumed responsibility from the MoD for the maintenance, storage and dissemination of information relating to \"ROC Service Records\" of those individuals who served with the Corps.\n\nIn 1986 the Royal Observer Corps Association (ROCA) was established with membership open to members of the ROC to provide close and continuing links between former ROC members. The association is organised on a regional basis with representation in each of the twenty five groups. Each group produces and distributes a magazine several times a year to keep the membership informed of developments and both local or national news.\n\nThe stated aims of the association are:\n\nThe association has actively continued since the ROC disbanded and still provides an additional contact point for ex-observers and their dependants. The ROCA also organises the annual reunion weekend each October at a suitable holiday resort hotel and provides an ROC contingent to the annual Remembrance Sunday event at the Cenotaph in London.\n\nMany control and post crews have formed sub-groups of the ROCA and have continued to meet on a weekly or monthly basis throughout the years since the initial stand down in 1991. Meeting at local Royal Air Forces Association Clubs or hotels, they invite visiting speakers, or arrange visits to local places of interest. Local ROCA members turn out for Remembrance Sunday and parades all over the country, with former members being permitted to wear the ROC beret and cap badge, together with any medals.\n\nDuring early 2008, \"ROCA 17 Group (North Wales)\" and \"4 Group (Colchester)\" seceded from the national organisation. Both groups rejoined the association in 2012.\n\nOn 12 September 2008, a replica of a No. 41 Squadron Spitfire MkIIA, wearing the \"\"Observer Corps\"\" badge and title, was installed as gate guardian at RAF High Wycombe. The original aircraft on which the replica is based; EB-Z ser. no P7666, was the personal aircraft of Sqn/Ldr Donald Finlay, Commanding Officer of No. 41 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch. This aircraft being one of two which Observer Corps personnel raised sufficient funds in order to purchase for the RAF at the start of World War II. (In 2010 a BAe Harrier GR9A was adorned with the tail code EB-Z and title \"\"Observer Corps\"\" in order to mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Harrier \"ZG857\" displayed these additional markings during the months which preceded the type's retirement from RAF service in March 2011).\n\nThe ROC has twice been commemorated by the naming of railway locomotives. Constructed in 1946, the Battle of Britain class steam locomotive no.34050 was named \"\"Royal Observer Corps\"\" in February 1948, and was presented with an ROC Long Service Medal ribbon at Waterloo station on 2 July 1961 by Air Commodore C M Wight-Boycott. Withdrawn from service and scrapped in 1965, the locomotive's nameplate survived and now forms part of the collection at the RAF Museum. Constructed in 1966, the British Rail Class 73 electro-diesel locomotive no.73137 was from 1985 until 1999 named \"\"Royal Observer Corps\"\". Marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Corps, Air Chief Marshal Sir David Craig undertook the naming ceremony at Waterloo Station on 30 October 1985.\n\nSeveral Group Control surface buildings which were demolished to make way for private housing developments have been commemorated by the naming of streets, including \"Observer Court\", Prestwick, \"Observer Close\", Truro, and \"Observer Close\", Bedford. The area of housing development at Kennet Heath, Thatcham, on the former site of RAF Thatcham, (until 1999 a distribution facility owned by the Defence Communication Services Agency), includes \"Observer Drive\" among the military-themed street names of the David Wilson Homes development. \"Royal Observer Way\" forms the access road to the Tesco superstore in Seaton, Devon.\n\nThe Royal Banner, (displayed at St Clement Danes Church), the stained glass window at Bentley Priory, those former posts, group controls, MoD bunkers and other sites operating as museums, and those individuals who attend memorial parades as members of the ROC Association, continue to provide a link to the ROC and its distinguished past roles in contributing to the defence of the United Kingdom. The ROC and those who have served throughout its history are commemorated at the National Memorial Arboretum, where members of the ROC Association regularly undertake practical grounds maintenance of the ROC \"grove\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nTechnical\n\nOther\n"}, {"id": "2166956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166956", "title": "Manuel Fernandes (footballer, born 1951)", "text": "Manuel Jos\u00e9 Tavares Fernandes (born 5 June 1951) is a Portuguese retired footballer who played as a striker, and a coach.\n\nOne of the country's most prolific goalscorers, his playing career was mainly associated with Sporting, which he later also coached. At 386 goals in all official competitions, he is the second-highest goalscorer in the club's history.\n\nOver 19 seasons, in which he also represented two other clubs, Fernandes amassed Primeira Liga totals of 485 matches and 241 goals.\n\nBorn in Sarilhos Pequenos, Moita, Set\u00fabal District, Fernandes started his career with local Grupo Desportivo da CUF, scoring 38 goals in five years. In 1975 he got his first break, joining Primeira Liga (the only tier he competed in in a career which spanned almost two decades) club Sporting Clube de Portugal, netting more than 250 times in official matches and only trailing legendary Fernando Peyroteo who totalled over 500.\n\nIn the 1985\u201386 season, at the ripe age of 34/35, Fernandes produced his best individual season, scoring 30 goals\u00a0\u2013 and winning the \"Bola de Prata\"\u00a0\u2013 for the eventual third-placed side, behind FC Porto and S.L. Benfica. On 14 December 1986 he had arguably his finest moment as a professional, when he netted four to help to the 7\u20131 home demolition of Benfica.\n\nAfter that season in Lisbon, Fernandes closed out his career with Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal\u00a0\u2013 reuniting with former Sporting teammate Rui Jord\u00e3o\u00a0\u2013 adding a further 16 league goals to his tally and retiring at 37. During his last campaign he notably scored against Sporting in a 2\u20131 home win, mere minutes after kick-off, and the \"Sadinos\" finished in a comfortable seventh place.\n\nFernandes began his coaching career with Set\u00fabal in 1988, and stayed with them a further year (several other spells there would befall in the future). Then, he went on to manage several teams: C.F. Estrela da Amadora, A.D. Ovarense, S.C. Campomaiorense, F.C. Tirsense, C.D. Santa Clara, F.C. Penafiel and Atl\u00e9tico Sport Avia\u00e7\u00e3o\u00a0\u2013 the Azores club would be the first from the region to play in the Portuguese top level.\n\nWith Sporting, Fernandes had already served as an assistant to England's Bobby Robson, leaving the \"Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade\" after the head coach was sacked. In 2001 he had a short managerial spell with the \"Lions\", winning the domestic Supercup before quitting his post later in the year.\n\nIn October 2009, after a successful promotion from the second division with U.D. Leiria, and having already started the following top flight campaign, Fernandes bought out his contract and returned to struggling Set\u00fabal for a third stint, which ended on 1 March 2011.\n\nFernandes won 31 caps for Portugal, scoring seven goals. Even though he had that stellar campaign with Sporting in 1985\u201386, he was excluded from the squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, which was marred by the Saltillo Affair.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2166957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166957", "title": "Institute of Directors", "text": "The Institute of Directors (IoD) is a business organisation for company directors, senior business leaders and entrepreneurs.

Members of the IoD also gain access to co-working spaces around the UK, bespoke market intelligence, tailored tax and legal support, exclusive member-only events along with discounts on IoD professional development courses and events.\n\nFrom a high of 55,000 members in 2005, the IoD currently has just over 30,000 full members. Members of the IoD come from companies of all sizes and from all industries . Around 70% work for small and medium-sized enterprises and are typically in senior management and boardroom-level positions, while 78% of FTSE 100 companies have an IoD member on their board or in a senior management position.\n\nThe IoD was founded in 1903 and incorporated by royal charter in 1906. The royal charter compels the IoD to:\n\n\nThe IoD represents individual members. Every member\u2019s voice carries equal weight within the organisation, and members retain their membership of the IoD throughout their career. This allows the IoD free rein to speak out on behalf of the business community and discuss individual companies in public.\n\nThere are currently 30,000 IoD members in the UK and overseas, with an additional 2,500 student members. Anybody who has an interest in business, is running a business, sits on a board or runs their own company can join the IoD.\n\nIn order to help address declining membership the IoD 99 was established in 2015. This initiative is aimed at members who are under the age of 42, and gives a substantial discount on membership fees. Additionally IoD Advance was launched in March 2016, which gives additional benefits in return for a higher annual subscription.\n\nThe IoD represents its members and makes the case for enterprise, entrepreneurialism and business in the public and to government. Working with various stakeholders, the IoD campaigns on issues of importance to its members and the wider business community to build an environment in the UK which supports businesses and makes is easy to start, grow and run a company.\n\nThe IoD has experts on tax, infrastructure, law, Europe, corporate governance, financial services, technology, education, skills and regulation, and campaigns on all of these issues.\n\nThe IoD\u2019s Information and Advisory Services offer members tailored and bespoke business advice on all aspects of running a business, including unbiased and confidential legal, financial, HR, marketing, and tax support.

There are role-specific training courses to equip directors with new skills to take on different roles along with the flagship Chartered Director course.\n\nTraining courses are open to both members and non-members, and around 5,000 people take part in an IoD course every year. The IoD networks also provide executive coaching, mentoring services and online learning zones.\n\nThe IoD hosts hundreds of networking, policy and social events throughout the year and across the country.\n\nThe Annual Convention is the flagship IoD event and a fixture of the business calendar and has historically taken place at the Royal Albert Hall each year. It draws some of the biggest business names and politicians and leaders from across the world. The convention has taken place every year since 1950. Nine different prime ministers have addressed the convention on more than eighteen occasions along with pioneers such as Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, and Richard Branson, serial entrepreneur, and members of the British royal family, including the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and the Charles, Prince of Wales. The last Annual Convention took place in September 2016 and included former Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, Lord Norman Lamont of Lerwick, global economist Dambisa Moyo, and Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nBecause of declining ticket and sponsorship revenues the Annual Convention took a year's break in 2017. The event in March 2018 was billed as \"IoD Open House\", a three-day business festival held at 116 Pall Mall.\n\nIn 2015, the IoD launched the annual Rhondda Lecture, in honour of Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda, the first female President of the IoD. The lecture celebrates radical thought, leadership, bold ideas and activism. Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister, delivered the inaugural lecture in June 2015 at 116 Pall Mall to an audience of politicians, academics, and business leaders. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative party, gave the 2016 lecture and was interviewed by BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg at 116 Pall Mall in December.\n\n\"Director\" is a business and lifestyle magazine for business leaders. It is circulated bi-monthly, is free to IoD members and available to purchase through subscription. It contains interviews with business leaders and politicians, updates from the IoD, debates on topical issues, reviews and features. In April 2017 it was announced that the editorial, advertising and production functions of the magazine will be transferred over to SevenC3, a contract publisher. As a result, a number of members of staff were made redundant. This was followed by an announcement in October 2017 that the magazine would be cut back to only six issues per year.\n\nThe IoD is made up of regional divisions and branches across the UK which serve as the local point of contact for IoD members. At the national level, the IoD is governed by a board and a council, which serves as the voice of IoD members.\n\nStephen Martin was the director-general until early 2019, having succeeded Simon Walker in October 2016. Following Stephen Martin's departure, Anna Daroy became interim director-general for operations and Edwin Morgan director-general for external affairs. In October 2019 Jonathan Geldart was appointed as the IoD's new director-general.\n\nBarbara, Lady Judge became the IoD's first female chairman in May 2015. She promised to champion women and work to boost the number of women in senior executive positions across British business. In September 2018, it was announced that she would be succeeded by Charlotte Valeur.\n\nThe IoD occupy the Grade I listed 116 Pall Mall in London, which is open to members of the IoD, and has rooms and function suites available for commercial hire. The building is owned by the Crown Estate, along with the large collection of artwork that decorates the rooms. Until 1978, the building was run by the United Service Club. The building was designed by John Nash, the 19th-century architect who also designed the Brighton Pavilion and Marble Arch, and constructed between 1826 and 1828.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, members also had use of 123 Pall Mall. This was opened as a contemporary meeting space in contrast with the more traditional 116 Pall Mall, and the interiors were created by noted designers Wayne and Geraldine Hemingway. Despite its popularity with members, the building was closed in 2014 as part of cost-saving measures.\n\n116 Pall Mall has been used as a location for many films and TV programmes, including \"Gandhi\", \"Foyle's War\", \"Downton Abbey\", \"The Ali G Show\", \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"The Dark Knight\".\n\n"}, {"id": "2166960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166960", "title": "Simon Bainbridge", "text": "Simon Bainbridge (born 30 August 1952) is a British composer, and a professor and former head of composition at the Royal Academy of Music, London, and visiting professor at the University of Louisville, Kentucky in the United States.\n\nSimon Bainbridge was born in London.

It was located in two borrowed rooms in the basement of the public library. The Institute offered classes in arts appreciation which were organized by Edwin Coupland Shaw and his wife Jennifer Bond Shaw. Its first permanent home was the Akron Public Library, a Carnegie library building, from 1948 to 1981. It has grown considerably since 1922. The new museum was open to the public on July 17, 2007, and hosts visiting shows from national and international collections.\n\nThe Akron Art Museum features of gallery space dedicated to the display of its collection of art produced since 1850. The museum also hosts visiting shows from national and international collections. \n1850\u20131950\n\nWestern art created between 1850 and 1950 graces the first floor of the museum's 1899 Italian Renaissance revival style building. The first two rooms feature examples of turn-of-the-century realism and American impressionism. Two rooms explore modernism and regionalism in northeast Ohio from 1910 through 1950. A final room is dedicated entirely to the work of William Sommer, a northeast Ohio artist. These galleries include paintings by Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Frederick Carl Frieseke. \n1950 to Now\n\nArt since 1950 is featured in eight rooms located in the museum's 2007 Knight building. These galleries reflect the eclectic style of late twentieth-century art through examples of postmodern painting and sculpture, photorealism and Pop Art. On view are Chuck Close\u2019s \"Linda\", an oversize early painting; Andy Warhol\u2019s silk-screened \"Single Elvis\" and \"Brillo Boxes\"; and Ohio carver and preacher Elijah Pierce\u2019s animated relief sculpture \"The Wise and Foolish Virgins and Four Other Scenes\".\n\nMajor temporary exhibitions are housed on the second floor of the Knight Building. These exhibitions include traveling shows, such as \"American Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell\", and shows organized by the museum, such as \"A Shared Vision: The Fred and Laura Ruth Bidwell Photography Collection\". The museum also features more than used for intimate exhibitions of emerging or mid-career artists, community-based art projects and changing exhibitions of photographic media.\n\nThe John S. and James L. Knight Building was designed by the Viennese architectural firm Coop Himmelb(l)au following an international competition.

He was a first baseman and left fielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Atlanta Braves, from 1966 to 1984. Watson was a two-time All-Star during his playing career. \n\nAfter retiring as a player, Watson coached for the Oakland Athletics and served as general manager for the Astros from 1993 through 1995 and Yankees from 1995 through 1998, during which time the team won the 1996 World Series. He served as MLB's vice president in charge of discipline and vice president of rules and on-field operations, from 2002 to 2010.\n\nWatson was born in Los Angeles on April 10, 1946. His parents separated prior to his birth, and his grandparents raised him. Watson attended John C. Fremont High School, where he played for the school's baseball team as a catcher. Fremont won the 1963 city championship; Watson's high school teammates included future major-leaguers Willie Crawford and Bobby Tolan. Watson went on to attend Los Angeles Harbor College.\n\nThe Houston Astros signed Watson as an amateur free agent in January 1965. He nearly quit baseball while playing in Minor League Baseball for an affiliate based in Savannah, Georgia, due to segregation in restaurants and hotels. Nicknamed \"Bull\", Watson converted to first base and the outfield by the time he made his major league debut with the Astros on September 9, 1966. Watson was a dependable hitter whose home run numbers were somewhat hurt by the fact that he played the majority of his career in the Astrodome, which had a reputation for being a pitcher-friendly ballpark.\n\nFrom 1966 through 1970, Watson appeared in less than 100 games each season for the Astros, batting .259, with 14 home runs, and 74 runs batted in (RBI) overall. From 1971 through 1978, Watson appeared in at least 129 games each season, batting .303, with 122 home runs, and 690 RBI altogether. He was selected as an All-Star twice; in 1973 and 1975. On June 24, 1977, Watson hit for the cycle in a 6\u20135 win over the San Francisco Giants. In total, during his 14 seasons with the Astros, Watson appeared in 1,381 games, batting .297, with 139 home runs, and 781 RBI.\nOn June 13, 1979, the Astros traded Watson to the Red Sox in exchange for Pete Ladd, cash, and a player to be named later (who turned out to be Bobby Sprowl). Watson played 84 games for the Red Sox through the remainder of the season. He batted .337 with 13 home runs and 53 RBI. On September 15, 1979, Watson again hit for the cycle. Having already hit for the cycle with the Astros in 1977, he became the first player to accomplish this feat in both the National League (NL) and American League (AL).\n\nFollowing the season, Watson signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees. With the Yankees, he reached the post-season for the first time in his career, losing to the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 American League Championship Series. A year later, Watson reached the World Series for the only time in his career. Watson hit two home runs and batted .318 with seven RBIs, but the Yankees lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\n\nOn April 23, 1982, the Yankees traded Watson to the Atlanta Braves for Scott Patterson. Watson helped propel the Braves to the 1982 National League West title. In 1983, Watson hit .309 mostly as a pinch hitter. He retired after the 1984 season.\n\nIn his MLB career \u2014 19 years and 1,832 regular season games played \u2014 Watson batted .295, with 184 home runs, and 989 RBI. He batted .371 in 17 postseason games.\n\nWatson was credited with scoring the 1,000,000th run in major league history on Sunday, May 4, 1975, at 12:32 in the afternoon. Watson scored from second base on a three-run homer by teammate Milt May at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. It was known that the 999,999th run had already scored, with sponsored updates being provided by and to every ballpark. Despite the lack of in-game urgency, Watson ran at full speed, reaching home plate approximately four seconds before Dave Concepci\u00f3n, who had just homered in Cincinnati and was also racing around the basepaths. \"I never ran so fast in my entire life,\" said Concepcion. But it was Watson who won $10,000 and one million Tootsie Rolls provided by the event's sponsor. The 1,000,000th run total only included runs scored in the National and American Leagues (not \"third\" major leagues, such as the Federal League). Watson joked that in the aftermath of the event, his fan mail doubled\u2014from four letters to eight. Later, more accurate recalculations of baseball's record-keeping showed that neither Watson nor Concepcion scored baseball's actual millionth run, and it is not known who did.\n\nAfter retirement, Watson moved into coaching and was the for the Oakland Athletics for four years. The Astros hired Watson as their assistant general manager after the 1988 season.\n\nAt the end of the 1993 season, Watson was named general manager of the Astros, becoming the second African American (following the Atlanta Braves' Bill Lucas) to serve as a GM in the major leagues. After the 1995 season, the Yankees hired Watson away from Houston to serve as their general manager. He served as GM for the Yankees from October 23, 1995, to February 2, 1998. The 1996 team won the World Series, the first Yankee team to do so since 1978. Thus, Watson became the first African American general manager to win a World Series championship.\n\nAfter the 1997 season, Watson retired from the Yankees. He served as MLB's vice president in charge of discipline and vice president of rules and on-field operations, beginning in 2002. In 2007 he was under consideration for a return engagement as the Astros general manager.\n\nIn 2000, Watson worked with USA Baseball to select the team roster competing in baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The United States national baseball team won the gold medal.\n\nWatson drew criticism late in the 2007 season. Under his watch, MLB mandated that managers could no longer wear a team issued pullover instead of a uniform jersey top. This caused particular friction between MLB and Red Sox manager Terry Francona, who prefers to wear a pullover due to circulation problems.\n\nDuring the second inning of a Red Sox-Yankees game on August 28, an MLB representative arrived to verify that Francona was wearing a uniform jersey. The Boston media saw this as frivolous, or even biased, due to the public's alleged indifference toward the issue, the specific use of Francona as an example, and the fact that the representative appeared during an important in-division matchup.\n\nWatson retired from his position with MLB in 2010.\n\nWatson and his wife, Carol, had two children.\n\nWhile playing for Houston, Watson, along with several teammates, had a cameo appearance in the 1977 movie \"The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training\".\n\nWatson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 1994, which was successfully treated. Watson wrote about his experience with prostate cancer in his 1997 book, \"Survive To Win\", and spoke regularly at cancer awareness conferences and with players and staff in Major League Baseball.

It was prepared in anticipation of the end of World War II and the reconstruction after bomb damage and large movements of population.\n\nIt focused on five defects, for which it proposed remedies:\n\n\nOne of the solutions was ring roads around the capital. Construction would have involved considerable disruption, even through parts of the city damaged by bombs, and the roads were not built, but the \"C Ring\" (the third ring out from the city centre) was to include what is now the South Circular Road. The plan to build a high-quality road was not realised but the semi-circular route was assigned to existing roads through the southern suburbs. A similar plan was revisited in the 1960s under the name of the London Ringways.\n\nIn 1905, the Royal Commission on London Traffic issued a report recommending improvements to road, tram and rail services including a \"circular road about 75 miles in length at a radius of 12 miles from St Paul's\".\n\nIn 1937, the Ministry of Transport published \"The Highway Development Survey\" by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Charles Bressey, which reviewed London's road needs and recommended the construction of many miles of roads and the improvement of junctions at key congestion points. Among the proposals was a series of orbital roads around the city with the outer ones built as American-style parkways - wide, landscaped roads with limited access and grade-separated junctions.\n\nThe report recommended electrification of all rail routes and removal of viaducts, with the elimination of rail bridges over the Thames a key priority. It was hoped that the removal of the river bridges would enable the redevelopment of the South Bank. \nThe proposals included a highly ambitious system of two-track bored rail tunnels in loop-shaped routes beneath built-up areas, large enough to handle main-line trains. These tunnels would provide tube-like service but without the need to change from a main-line train to a tube train. As a result, some tube routes would be transformed into freight-only routes, with the northern portion of the Circle line specifically mentioned in this regard.\nThe proposed railway tunnels would have been as follows:\nan \u201cInner Ring\u201d and an \u201cOuter Ring\u201d of freight-only railways was proposed:\n\nThese proposals were further reported on in May 1946 by the Railway (London Plan) Committee, which had been appointed by the Minister of War Transport in February 1944. It was chaired by Sir Charles Inglis. The committee concluded that the cost and time required to carry out the recommendations of the London plan meant that the proposals would not be achievable in a short period of time and could not be carried out until adequate alternative capacity could be provided. Of the four central proposals the one supported by the committee was the North-South Tunnel. The 1946 report recommended a dozen new routes totalling over 100 miles, estimated to cost \u20a4230m and take at least 30 years to build. Among them were 'route 8', from East Croydon to Finsbury Park, in tunnel from Norbury via Streatham, Brixton and the Victoria line route, except Victoria-Hyde Park Corner-Bond St-Euston.\n\n"}, {"id": "2166984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166984", "title": "Ernst Josephson", "text": "Ernst Abraham Josephson (1851-1906) was a Swedish painter and poet. He specialized in portraits, genre scenes of folklife and folklore.\nHe was born to a middle-class family of merchants of Jewish ancestry. His uncle, Ludvig Josephson (1832-1899) was a dramatist and his uncle Jacob Axel Josephson (1818-1880) was a composer. \nWhen he was ten, his father Ferdinand Semy Ferdinand Josephson (1814-1861) left home and he was raised by his mother, Gustafva Jacobsson\n(1819-1881) and three older sisters.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, he decided to become an artist and, with his family's support, enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. His primary instructors there were Johan Christoffer Boklund and August Malmstr\u00f6m. He was there until 1876, when he received a Royal Medal for painting.\n\nAfter leaving the Academy, he and his friend and fellow artist Severin Nilsson (1846-1918) visited Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, where they copied the Old Masters. His breakthrough came in Paris, where he was able to study with Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He soon began concentrating on portraits, including many of his friends and fellow Swedes in France. For a time, he shared a studio with Hugo Birger (1854\u20131887). His personal style developed further during a trip to Seville with his friend, Anders Zorn, from 1881 to 1882.\nHis private life did not go well, however. By his late twenties, he was afflicted with syphilis. His romantic life suffered as a consequence, as he was forced to break off a promising relationship with a young model named Ketty Rindskopf.\n\nIn the 1880s, a painting that is now considered one of his masterpieces, \"Str\u00f6mkarlen\" (1882-1884) was rejected by the Nationalmuseum. It was eventually purchased by Prince Eugen (1865-1947), himself a skilled amateur artist and art patron, who hung it at his home, Waldemarsudde, now a museum on Djurg\u00e5rden in Stockholm. In total Ernst Josephson is also represented at the museum with ten other oil paintings and a large number of drawings.\nIn 1881, his mother died. They had been very close and it affected him deeply. There was one bright spot; in 1883 he obtained the patronage of Pontus Furstenberg (1827-1902), a wealthy merchant and art collector. In 1885, he became a supporter of the \"\", a group that was protesting the outmoded teaching methods at the Swedish Academy. But his interest in the group diminished when he failed to win election to their governing board.\n\nBy the summer of 1888, he was beginning to have delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness. He installed himself on the \u00cele-de-Br\u00e9hat in Brittany, where he had spent the previous summer with painter and engraver Allan \u00d6sterlind (1855-1938) and his family. There, he became involved in spiritism, possibly inspired by \u00d6sterlind's interest in occult phenomena. While in his visionary states, he wrote poems and created paintings that he signed with the names of dead artists. Some of his best known and most influential works were created during this period.\nShortly after, \u00d6sterlind took him back to Sweden and he was admitted to , a mental institution in Uppsala. He remained there for several months. The diagnosis was paranoia, but his condition would now most likely be called schizophrenia. After being released, he continued to associate with his old friends, who did what they could to help him. His paintings had become rather distorted, but his earlier works were shown at exhibitions in Paris and Berlin, thanks to arrangements made by Richard Bergh and Georg Pauli, and he received several medals for them. As the years progressed, his physical health declined. First he suffered from rheumatic problems, which prevented him from painting. Then he was diagnosed with diabetes, which was the cause of his death in 1906.\n\nA street, \"Ernst Josephsons v\u00e4g\" in S\u00f6dra \u00c4ngby is named after him.

In North American building codes, it, along with fire dampers, is often referred to as a closure, which can be derated compared against the fire separation that contains it, provided that this barrier is not a firewall or an occupancy separation. In Europe national standards for fire doors have been harmonised with the introduction of the new standard EN 16034, which refers to fire doors as fire-resisting door sets. Starting September 2016, a common CE marking procedure was available abolishing trade barriers within the European Union for these types of products. In the UK, it is Part B of the Building Regulations that sets out the minimum requirements for the fire protection that must be implemented in all dwellings this includes the use of fire doors. All fire doors must be installed with the appropriate fire resistant fittings, such as the frame and door hardware, for it to fully comply with any fire regulations.\n\nIn the UK the British Woodworking Federation outline the difference between a 'Fire Doorset' and a 'Fire Door Assembly'.\n\nFire doors may be made of a combination of materials, such as:\n\nBoth the door leaf (the swinging panel of the door) and the door frame are required to meet the guidelines of the testing agency which provides the product listing. The door frame includes the fire or smoke seals, door hardware, and the structure that holds the fire door assembly in place. Together, these components form an assembly, typically called a \"doorset\" which holds a numerical rating, quantified in hours of resistance to a test fire. All of the components of the fire door assembly must bear a listing agencies label (with the exception of ball-bearing hinges which meet the basic build requirements of ANSI 156.2 and NFPA 80) to ensure the components have been tested to meet the fire rating requirements.\n\nDoor hardware includes:\n\nEdges of a fire door usually need to have fire rated seals which can be composed of:\n\nWhen intumescent seals are used in the door design, use of the correct seal is crucial in the fire rating performance the door assembly. Seals may vary in chemical composition, expansion rate, expansion volume, and/or charring characteristics.\n\nSome fire doors are equipped with integral windows which also have a rating, or have been incorporated at the time of the door test and be subject to the overall door's product certification. Fire-resistive windows must remain intact under fire conditions and hose stream impact resistance, and can include:\n\nWired glass typically withstands the fire, whereas the sodium silicate liquid also acts to insulate heat transfer, due to the endothermic action of this chemical.\nAll components are required to adhere to product certification requirements that are acceptable to the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) by meeting the requirements of the local building code and fire code. The regulatory requirement change from country to country. For example, in Australia, the National Construction Code dictates that all fire doors must be tested to certain specifications in order to meet resistance approvals and certification.\n\nIn the United Kingdom a fire resisting doorset should be subjected to either a British Standard Fire Test BS 476 Part 22 1987, or a BS/EN 1634-1 2000 test. The results are recorded by the test agency and provided in a report which detail such things as constructional details, distortion data and pressure readings. The numerical fire resistance rating that is required to be installed in a particular building is provided in the Building Regulations approved Document B, or British Standards such as the BS 5588 series (e.g., 30 minutes FD30, or FD30(S) if cold smoke resistance is also required).\n\nSimilar technical guidance documents and building regulations are in effect in other countries.\n\nFire doors are not necessarily noncombustible. It is acceptable for portions of the door to be destroyed by combustion during exposure to a fire as long as the door assembly meets the fire test criteria of limiting temperature on the non-fire side of the assembly. This is in accordance with the overall performance goal of a fire rated door to slow fire propagation from one fire rated compartment to another for only a limited amount of time, during which automatic or manual fire fighting may be employed to limit fire spread, or occupants can exit the building.\n\nFire doors are sometimes rendered unable to provide their listed fire resistance by ignorance of the intended use and associated restrictions and requirements, or by improper use. For example, fire doors are sometimes blocked open, or carpets are run through them, which would allow the fire to travel past the fire barrier in which the door is placed. The door's certification markings are displayed both on the door leaves and the fire door frames, and should not be removed or painted over during the life of the building.\n\nSometimes fire doors have apparently very large gaps at the foot of them, an inch or two even, allowing air movement, such as in dormitory facilities. This can lead the occupants of a building to question their status as 'real' fire doors. NFPA 80 allows a maximum door \"undercut\" of 3/4\u00a0inch however fire doors are tested with smaller clearances in accordance with NFPA 252. Corridors have a fire rating of one hour or less, and the fire doors in them are required by code to have a fire rating of 1/2 or 1/3 hour, the intent of which is mainly to restrict smoke travel.\n\nMost fire doors are designed to be kept closed at all times. Some doors are designed to stay open under normal circumstances, and close automatically in the event of a fire. Whichever method is used, the door's movement should never be impaired by a doorstop or other obstacle. The intumescent and smoke-seal bounding of fire doors should be routinely checked, as should the action of the door closer and latch.\n\nSome fire doors are held open by an electromagnet, which may be wired to a fire alarm system. If the power fails or the fire alarm is activated, the coil is de-energized, and the door closes. Wireless, battery operated fire door retainers can also be used to safely and legally hold fire doors open.\n\nRated fire doors are tested to withstand an ASTM E119 standard time-temperature curve for a specified period. There are 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90-minute-rated fire doors that are certified by an approved laboratory designated as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL, e.g., Underwriters Laboratories). The certification only applies if all parts of the installation are correctly specified and installed. For example, fitting the wrong kind of glazing may severely reduce the door's fire resistance period.\n\nAs well as ensuring the door is hung properly and squarely, it is also very important that where a fire door is installed, any gaps left in the opening between the wall and the door frame must be properly filled with fire resisting material. Fire doors are normally installed by a carpenter.\n\nIn the United States, the NFPA requires annual inspections of fire-resistance rated door and frame assemblies. Local Authorities Having Jurisdiction must adopt the new edition for this requirement to take effect. Most jurisdictions in the US will be adopting the IBC (International Building Code) model code, which references the NFPA 80 2007 edition requirement, as their local codes.\n\nNFPA 80 5.2.4.requires the following items shall be verified, at minimum:\n\nAccording to building and fire codes, annual fire door inspections is the responsibility of the building owner. However, as with other mandatory fire inspections, such as the inspection of fire dampers, the fire door inspections are often omitted and many facilities are out of compliance.\n\nThe final say on the acceptance of any inspection requires the approval of the AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction).\n\nNFPA 80 includes guidelines concerning field modifications of listed hardware, including frames, builder's hardware, doors, thresholds etc. The growing field of access control and electronic entry systems has resulted in some fire doors being field modified without proper listing agency approval. Field modifications of fire listed assemblies must either be inspected by a listing agency representative, or the modification must be performed by personnel certified to perform such work.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167005", "title": "Diehard tests", "text": "The diehard tests are a battery of statistical tests for measuring the quality of a random number generator.

An Immortal, he is portrayed by the British actor Adrian Paul.\n\n\"Highlander: The Series\" was originally created to carry on directly from the movies with Paul playing the same character Christopher Lambert had played in the movie, but early in development, Paul requested that a new character be created to avoid direct comparisons with Lambert and to allow him to develop his own character. Consequently, Duncan is introduced in the pilot episode as Connor MacLeod's clansman and pupil, and the series focuses on his own life over four centuries.\n\nThe series does not tell Duncan's story in chronological order. Instead, the primary sequence of events is set in a present time that corresponds to the years during which the six seasons were filmed, i.e. 1992\u20131998, and extensive use of flashbacks is made to show Duncan's memories and their implications in present time.\n\nIt is established in the pilot episode \"\", set in 1992, that Duncan is almost 400 years old and thus was born around 1592 and raised in Glenfinnan, Scotland. In the second episode, \"\", Duncan's father and Chieftain of Clan MacLeod, Ian MacLeod, states that the newborn Duncan was a foundling given to his wife Mary to replace the stillborn son she had delivered, and raised to be his successor. The same episode also shows how Duncan is brought home fatally wounded in battle, dies in front of his father, and awakens with his wounds completely healed. Because his family believes his resurrection is a sign of witchcraft, he is cast out from his clan after being disowned by his adoptive father. The Watcher Chronicle of this episode states that it happens in 1622 during a dispute with the Clan Campbell. In \"The Gathering\", Duncan and Connor MacLeod explain how Connor, who had undergone a similar ordeal in 1536, found Duncan in 1625, told him about his immortality and became his mentor.\n\nThe series' various flashbacks show Duncan having many adventures across four centuries, including visiting Renaissance France and Italy (\"\"), traveling to China (\"\"), witnessing the French Revolution, becoming a Sioux warrior (\"The Gathering\"), fighting in World War I (\"\") and II (\"Mortal Sins\"), and generally fighting for justice against evil. In 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, he meets Immortal Darius who has rejected war, and follows his example by becoming a non-lethal participant in the later conflicts (for example, as a medic). The series especially focuses on adventures shared with friends Amanda and Hugh \"Fitz\" Fitzcairn.\nDuring his life, Duncan meets and learns many things from many people that mold him to become a great Immortal. He meets many other Immortals: some become mentors, while others become friends and yet others become enemies. Beginning as a young immortal, full of bravado (based on naivety) and also reckless and uneducated, he gradually changes and matures as he travels the world until he becomes the wise, educated and compassionate character of present times. He is an expert in many subjects, fluent in many languages (Gaelic, English, Sioux, French, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, German, Greek, and Arabic) and skilled in many forms of martial arts including; Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, Wing Chun, karate, aikido, tae kwon do, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, ninjitsu, Muay Thai, boxing, and Jeet Kune Do. He has had many occupations including; soldier, bodyguard, newspaper editor, World War I ambulance driver, chauffeur, and World War II Resistance fighter. More recently he is an antiques dealer, a dojo owner and a part-time History teacher.\n\n1992\u20131998 is a critical period for Duncan. Being the years during which the series was filmed, they are also the years in which the series' \"present time\" is set and thus depict many important events in his life. The pilot episode \"The Gathering\" shows Duncan returning to The Game after a period of semi-retirement with his girlfriend Tessa No\u00ebl and a meeting with clansman and mentor Connor MacLeod. Across the series, Duncan meets many old friends and enemies again, many old debts are repaid between them, and Duncan kills many Immortals. He loses people he cares about, including Tessa, the love of his life (\"\"), Immortal friends Darius (\"The Hunters\") and Hugh Fitzcairn (\"Star-Crossed\"), and mortal friend Charlie DeSalvo (\"Brothers in Arms\"). He befriends Richie Ryan (\"The Gathering\"), mentors him after his First Death (\"The Darkness\") and teaches him the ways of the Immortals, then accidentally kills him in 1997 during a confrontation with the demon Ahriman (\"Archangel\"). He meets Joe Dawson, who reveals to him that there is an organization known as The Watchers who secretly observes all Immortals (\"\"). He also meets Methos, the legendary oldest Immortal (\"Methos\"), and eventually defeats Ahriman (\"Armageddon\").\n\nThe first part of the first five seasons of \"Highlander: The Series\" was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia while the second part was filmed in Paris, France. This is why Duncan travels back-and-forth every six months. The sixth season, which was also the series' last, was filmed entirely in Paris.\n\nIn the feature film \"\" (2000), it is revealed that Immortal Jacob Kell has spent the last four centuries killing all people close to Connor MacLeod because Connor had killed Kell's adoptive father. He also gathered a posse of Immortals who would overpower other Immortals, allowing Kell to then enter and take their heads. In the 1990s, Connor hid in a place called The Sanctuary, where Immortals were protected from The Game by the Watchers. Ten years after the murder of Connor's adopted daughter Rachel Ellenstein, Kell attacked the Sanctuary, and Connor was believed to be dead along with the other Immortals sheltered there. Duncan has visions of this evil act and investigates. He discovers Connor had been spared by Kell, so as to make his life even more of a misery. Kell wants to kill Duncan only to agonize Connor further, and given the number of Quickenings he has received, he would succeed in doing so. Therefore, Connor forces Duncan to kill him, to absorb his power, thereby enabling Duncan to defeat Kell. Duncan once again has to lose a friend but in the end he understands that Connor's death was necessary and it was the only possible way for him to kill Kell. Duncan buried Connor in the Scottish Highlands, in Glencoe, next to his first wife Heather's remains. The film also reveals that Duncan was married in 1715 to an Irish woman named Kate Devaney. Knowing that Kate was a pre-Immortal, Duncan killed her on their wedding night to trigger her immortality but, after reviving, the frightened Kate rejected Duncan and fled. In the film's present, Kate (now called Faith) is an underling of Jacob Kell.\n\nIn the TV movie \"\" (2007), Duncan has married a mortal woman named Anna Teshemka and has since separated from her. He is reunited with her at the monastery of the Elder an ancient Immortal who is cursed to forever age but not die, and Duncan joins in the quest to reach the Source of Immortality after the death of Joe Dawson. As he grows close to the Source, he becomes mortal along with the other Immortals in the group (which includes Methos). After defeating the Guardian, an ancient Immortal who guards the Source, Duncan is able to enter the Source with Anna, as they have sexual intercourse, she reveals to him that she is pregnant with their child.\n\nA series of nine licensed novels were released from October 1995 to February 1999. These novels detail additional events in Duncan's life. In these novels, Duncan fights an Immortal Scottish pirate with his clansman Connor, meets and later beheads the Immortal Niccolo Machiavelli, travels to Tibet where he meets the 8th Dalai Lama, searches for gold in the Yukon with Hugh Fitzcairn and his pupil, becomes involved in the Arab Revolt, reunites with TV series Immortal Annie Devlin who attempts to get him involved in another attempt to win Scottish independence, protects a Palestinian diplomat from an Immortal Jewish militant and encounters a spurned Immortal lover of Darius.\n\nA German language novel entitled \"Highlander: Die R\u00fcckkehr des Unsterblichen\" (\"Highlander: The Return of the Immortal\") was also released. The novel deals with the aftermath of Duncan beheading a female Immortal and wishing to leave The Game. The novel takes place during the season one episode \"\".\n\nA series called \"Highlander Imagine\" has also been published. This series is set in an alternate continuity where Tessa survives the events of \"\".\n\nDuncan also appears in the \"Highlander\" comics. In the fifth issue of the comics he comforts Connor after Brenda Wyatt is injured in a car accident on New Year's Eve, 1986. In issues #6 to #9, later released as a trade paperback entitled \"Highlander: Dark Quickening\", Duncan helps Connor deal with the aftereffects of The Kurgan's Quickening. In issues #6 to #9, later released as \"Highlander: Armageddon\", Duncan is captured by a renegade Watcher group called the Eye and is forced to compete in an Immortal fight club.\n\nAdrian Paul reprises his role as Duncan MacLeod in four audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions. In the audio plays Duncan deals with an Immortal named Pieter Gatlin who challenges him to a duel every ten years, encounters the Immortal Maria Rostov who carries a sexually transmitted disease that is deadly to other Immortals, is questioned by the police over a katana that belonged to an Immortal he beheaded and encounters a mortal magnate who wishes to resurrect The Kurgan.\n\nDuncan also appears in \"Highlander: A Celtic Opera\", an opera jointly composed by Roger Bellon and Harlan Collins. The opera follows Duncan's banishment from his clan, his relationship with a mortal woman named Aurora who becomes his first wife and his encounters with an Immortal Visigoth named Fritagern from the 17th century to the 21st. In the end, Duncan beheads Fritagern after he murders Duncan's fiancee, a cloned Aurora, on their wedding day.\n\nDuncan is portrayed as being tall and brown-haired (usually long and/or in a ponytail). Like all Immortals, his aging process stopped at the moment of his First Death when he was three months away from his 30th birthday. Thus he's been looking like a man in his early thirties for four hundred years and will do so until, if ever, he is beheaded. His injuries heal very quickly and when he is killed by any means other than beheading, he revives some time later fully healthy again.\n\nDuncan was raised to be the next chieftain of his clan and this fact influenced his personality. He has a strong moral conscience and a sense of nobility; he protects the weak and innocent and punishes the evildoers. He is known to be very loyal. He is referred to by more than one character as a \"Boy Scout\" and tends to see things in terms of black and white, being often criticized \u2013 sometimes in jest, sometimes not \u2013 for his rigid sense of honor and his determination to intervene in events that often place him in danger. He feels responsible for others and when he thinks people died because of him, he feels he has to avenge them. He mentors new Immortals even when he has doubts about them. Like all Immortals, he is unable to have children, but he likes them and takes care of those he meets.\n\nDuncan enjoys life. As Connor said, he has \"all the fun and most of the good women\". Although he has known many women, he shares his life with a few women he grows to love. Those who are mortal, he remains loyal to their memories and cherishes the moments he had with them. He is a perfectionist and keen to learn new things, be it reading, playing Shakespeare or fighting skills (see below). He is cunning and very difficult to defeat in combat because of his skill and because he has experienced most of everything life has to offer. He has a very good memory and can remember things that happened centuries ago.\n\nAs an Immortal, Duncan takes The Game with a grain of salt. He fulfills his duty and defends his head when he is challenged but he is not bloodthirsty and occasionally spares his opponents, especially female Immortals. Indeed, he does not hunt other Immortals for their heads, but he fights evil ones if they attack people he cares about. As he tells Alexei Voshin, \"if you harm people I care about, I'll send you to hell the hard way\". Unlike Connor, for example, he does not consider The Game his primary purpose in life and sometimes retires from it.\n\nDuncan is not prejudiced against mortals (Indeed, despising mortals is an attribute of most evil Immortals). Duncan is generally very generous to mortals, and almost always tries to avoid hurting them. Being four hundred years old, he has seen thousands of them age and die and thus acutely, and sometimes bitterly knows how fragile they are. \"I have mourned more friends than I can count. Death is part of my life.\" For this reason, he protects them, especially from evil Immortals and from the dangerous consequences The Game can have for them. He feels they have nothing to do with it and should not suffer from it. He does not usually tell them about his immortality except when he trusts them with his life. He never gets used to death, especially the death of his lovers. As he tells Tessa : \"No matter how many years go by. Or how many times you say goodbye to those you care most about, when they leave, you...\" [\"Tessa\": \"Die...\"] \"...yes. When they die, you're naked and alone.\" But it never prevents him from involving himself in life again.\n\nAfter becoming a mentor to Richie, he matures into something of a father-figure, with a stronger, more confident outlook on life. After Richie's death, he becomes a darker, brooding character acutely aware of the fragility of life and his participation in The Game decreases.\n\nDespite the fact that he was exiled from his own clan after his First Death in 1622, he remains proud of, and faithful to, his Scottish heritage. He usually introduces himself to other Immortals as \"Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod\" and fought for Scottish independence whenever he could, including the Battle of Culloden in 1746 (\"Take Back the Night\"), eventually trying to steal the Stone of Scone in 1950 (\"The Stone of Scone\"). In the book \"\", despite its questionable canonicity, he remembers having helped to steal the Stone in a different version, closer to what really happened.\n\nExecutive Producer Bill Panzer thinks, \"once you've hurt him, he doesn't forget. And Immortals have a long time to remember, and sooner or later you will cross his path.\"\n\nDuncan considers himself \"an old soldier\" and fighting has been part of his life since the beginning, when he was raised to be a warrior. Being a perfectionist, he always seeks to improve himself and never misses an occasion to learn new skills. Aside from bare-knuckle brawling, he first learned swordsmanship in Scotland and the European continent. He then discovered martial arts during his travels in the lands of East Asia during the late 1700s. His sword is a katana, featuring a dragon's head, which was given by samurai warrior Hideo Koto in 1778 during his travels to Japan. Duncan should have inherited the claymore of his (adoptive) father, Chieftain of the Clan MacLeod, but because he was exiled the sword was instead kept within the clan. (In one episode he finds his father's claymore hanging as an antique in a Scottish tavern, and uses it to kill the immortal who killed his father some time after he was exiled). In fact, Duncan usually tries to avoid killing mortals even when he is forced to fight them, and goes out of his way to use non-lethal methods. Although MacLeod has fought in many armed conflicts and is skilled with firearms, he is reluctant to use them and rarely does so throughout the series.\n\nDuncan is an excellent swordsman among Immortals. Although he is not one of the oldest Immortals in the Game, he has defeated numerous Immortals who are much older than himself, and many villainous Immortals, both male and female, with utterly fearsome reputations.\n\nIn the TV series continuity, Duncan is the favourite to win The Prize. In \"\" it is established that Duncan has taken 176 heads. Here's the list of all of Duncan's known Quickenings:\n\nTimothy beheads himself. Duncan's first Quickening.\n\nDuncan's first beheading.\n\nBeheaded by a propeller blade.\n\nBeheaded by a train.\n\nBeheaded by Watcher Jack Shapiro.\n\nDouble Quickening with Methos who beheaded Silas at the same time.\n\nHere's a list of all of Duncan's known Watchers:\n\nMovies \u2013 \"\", \"\"\n\nEpisodes \u2013 \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"The Samurai\", \"Line of Fire\", \"The Revolutionary\", \"The Cross of St. Antoine\", \"Rite of Passage\", \"Courage\", \"The Lamb\", \"Obsession\", \"Shadows\", \"Blackmail\", \"Vendetta\", \"They Also Serve\", \"Blind Faith\", \"Song of the Executioner\", \"Star-Crossed\", \"Methos\", \"Take Back the Night\", \"Testimony\", \"Mortal Sins\", \"Reasonable Doubt\", \"Finale\", \"Finale Part 2\", \"Homeland\", \"Brothers in Arms\", \"The Innocent\", \"Leader of the Pack\", \"Double Eagle\", \"Reunion\", \"The Colonel\", \"Reluctant Heroes\", \"The Wrath of Kali\", \"Chivalry\", \"Timeless\", \"The Blitz\", \"Something Wicked\", \"Deliverance\", \"Promises\", \"Methuselah's Gift\", \"The Immortal Cimoli\", \"Through A Glass, Darkly\", \"Double Jeopardy\", \"Till Death\", \"Judgement Day\", \"One Minute to Midnight\", \"Prophecy\", \"The End of Innocence\", \"Manhunt\", \"Glory Days\", \"Dramatic License\", \"Money No Object\", \"Haunted\", \"Little Tin God\", \"The Messenger\", \"The Valkyrie\", \"Comes a Horseman\", \"\", \"The Ransom of Richard Redstone\", \"Duende\", \"The Stone of Scone\", \"Forgive Us Our Trespasses\", \"The Modern Prometheus\", \"Archangel\", \"Avatar\", \"Armageddon\", \"Sins of the Father\", \"Diplomatic Immunity\", \"Patient Number 7\", \"Black Tower\", \"Unusual Suspects\", \"Justice\", \"Deadly Exposure\", \"To Be\", \"Not To Be\"\n\nBooks \u2013 \"\", \", , , , , , , , , \", \"\", \"\", \"\"\n\nComics \u2013 \"\", \"\"\n\nAudio plays \u2013 \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"\n\n\"TV Guide\" ranked Duncan MacLeod # 11 on its \"25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends\" list.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167047", "title": "Shell Eco-marathon", "text": "Shell Eco-marathon is a world-wide energy efficiency competition sponsored by Shell.

There are three energy categories within Shell Eco-marathon: battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and internal combustion engine (gasoline, ethanol, or diesel). Prizes are awarded separately for each vehicle class and energy category. The pinnacle of the competition is the Shell Eco-marathon Drivers' World Championship, where the most energy-efficient UrbanConcept vehicles compete in a race with a limited amount of energy.\n\nShell Eco-marathon competitions are held around the world with nine events as of 2018. The 2018 competition season includes events held in Singapore, California, Paris, London, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro, India, and China. Participants are students from various academic backgrounds including university teams such as past finalists Duke University, University of Toronto, University of Michigan, and University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2018, over 5,000 students from over 700 universities in 52 countries participated in Shell Eco-marathon.

Prototype vehicles using fuel cells are capable of greater energy efficiency. In 2005, a hydrogen-powered vehicle built by Swiss team ETH Zurich achieved a projected 3,836\u00a0km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel. This is equivalent to the distance between Paris and Moscow. In 2013, ethanol efficiency world record was set by Toulouse Ingenerie Multidisciplinarie with 3100\u00a0km of a single litre of ethanol. This is equivalent to the distance between Toulouse and Istanbul.\n\nThe Eco-Marathon has different classes of competition, according to the energy source used: Fuel cells, solar cells, gasoline, Diesel fuel and LPG. During the competition, cars must attain an average speed of at least 15\u00a0mph (23\u00a0km/h) over a distance of 10 miles (16\u00a0km). The course is typically a motor racing track or closed-off city streets. The fuel is strictly measured out for each entrant at the start and end of the course. The difference is used to calculate the vehicle's average fuel consumption. Solar-powered vehicles are not eligible for the grand prize for fuel efficiency.\n\nIn 2017, more than 100 student teams from many countries across the Americas competed in the Shell-Eco Marathon Americas to a crowd of over 20,000 throughout the competitions at the Cobo Center in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThe top performing vehicles are purpose designed for high efficiency.

Her father was a member of the Hanjun Plain White Banner Corps (), and according to his daughter he was a Lord. This is of some doubt. After serving as Chinese minister to Japan, he was appointed minister to the French Third Republic for four years in 1899. He was known for his progressive, reformist views; for his determination to educate his children, including the girls, in western schools, which was highly unusual in their generation; and for his unvarying support of the Empress Dowager Cixi. In 1905, Y\u00fc Keng died in Shanghai. Y\u00fc Keng's story is told in the movie \" Dai noi kwan ying\". According to Der Ling's biographer, Der Ling's mother had an American father and a Chinese mother. However, in the book, whatever her background, she is repeatedly referred to by other people as a Manchu.\n\nY\u00fc Keng's daughters Der Ling and Rong Ling (1889\u20131973, the future Madame Dan Paochao of Beijing) received a western education, learning French and English, and studying dance in Paris with Isadora Duncan. Upon their return to China, Der Ling became the First lady-in-waiting to the Empress Dowager Cixi, as well as interpreting for her when she received foreign visitors. Der Ling stayed at court until March 1905. In 1907, Der Ling married Thaddeus C. White, an American. Der Ling had a brother, Xunling (ca. 1880\u20131943), who studied photography in France and later took the only photographs of Empress Dowager Cixi still in existence.\n\nUsing the title of Princess, which would create controversy for her in both China and the United States in the future, Der Ling wrote of her experiences in court in her memoir \"Two Years in the Forbidden City\", which was published in 1911. She states in her book that the status of Princess, which the Empress Dowager had given her, was valid only within the palace. As the Guangxu Emperor, who was under a form of house arrest, never confirmed the title, it was not valid in the outside world. \"Two Years\" provides unique insights into life at the Manchu court and the character of the Empress Dowager Empress, a world that ended abruptly with the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu or Qing dynasty. Der Ling continued to write and published seven more books.\n\nPrincess Der Ling, a.k.a. Mrs. Thaddeus C. White, died in Berkeley, California, as a result of being struck by a car while crossing an intersection. She had recently taught Chinese at University of California, Berkeley.\n\nDer Ling was not a member of the Qing royal family. Although Der Ling claimed to be an ethnic Manchu, her father Y\u00fc Keng was actually a Han Chinese Bannerman and not part of the ethnic Manchu Banners. Her father was not royal but was a bannerman, just as Der Ling claimed she was a Manchu while she was actually a Chinese Bannerwoman.\n\nA biography of Der Ling, \"Imperial Masquerade: The Legend of Princess Der Ling\", by Grant Hayter-Menzies, was published in January 2008 by Hong Kong University Press.\n\nAfter Cixi's death in 1908, Der Ling professed to be so angered by what she saw as false portraits of Cixi appearing in books and periodicals that she wrote her own account of serving \"Old Buddha\", which she called \"Two Years in the Forbidden City\". This book appeared in 1911, just before the fall of the Qing dynasty, and was a popular success.\n\nIn this book, Cixi is not the monster of depravity depicted in the popular press and in the second and third hand accounts left by foreigners who had lived in Beijing, but an aging woman who loved beautiful things, had many regrets about the past and the way she had dealt with the many crises of her long reign, and apparently trusted Der Ling enough to share many memories and opinions with her.\n\nDer Ling would go on to write seven more books about this relatively brief period in her youth when she had been close to the centre of failing imperial Chinese power, and sharing this personal history and her habit of promoting herself and her writings caused most of her family to turn against her. All of this has made it difficult to assess Der Ling's contribution to late Qing historiography. But the fact remains that she was the first woman of Cixi's own ethnic background to live with and observe her and then write about what it was like; if many of Der Ling's recollections smack of the every day minutiae of a court that thrived on details and form, her writings are no less valuable for focusing on them, particularly as life within the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace was a closed book for most people in China, let alone in the rest of the world. It was misunderstanding of much of what emanated from the throne that created so many of the problems Cixi has been wholly blamed for.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167055", "title": "WCWA World Light Heavyweight Championship", "text": "The WCWA Light Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling championship promoted by the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex area-based World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA) promotion from September 13, 1987 until May 1989.

By being published first in Iran, the book falls under the national copyright law of Iran. This copyright measure created an unusual situation where a book is first published in a language other than the author's native language. However, the book was banned in Iran a few months after its publication, during the 18th Tehran International Book Fair.\n\nIntended as a work of fiction, the story has strong autobiographical features, which led to an attack on the book's shallow egotism in the English press.. Coelho named British war correspondent and author Christina Lamb as the inspiration for the character Esther in \"The Zahir\".\n\n\"The Zahir\" means 'the obvious' or 'conspicuous' in Arabic. The story revolves around the life of the narrator, a bestselling novelist, and in particular his search for his missing wife, Esther. He enjoys all the privileges that money and celebrity bring. He is suspected of foul play by both the police and the press, who suspect that he may have had a role in the inexplicable disappearance of his wife from their Paris home.\n\nAs a result of this disappearance, the protagonist is forced to re-examine his own life as well as his marriage. The narrator is unable to figure out what led to Esther's disappearance. Was she abducted or had she abandoned the marriage? He encounters Mikhail, one of Esther's friends, during a book launch. He learns from Mikhail that Esther, who had been a war correspondent against the wishes of her husband (the protagonist), had left in a search for peace, as she had trouble living with her husband. The author eventually realizes that in order to find Esther he must first find his own self. Mikhail introduces him to his own beliefs and customs, his mission of spreading love by holding sessions in restaurants and meeting homeless people living in the streets. He tells the narrator about the voices he hears, and his beliefs related to them. The narrator, who only too frequently falls in love with women, \nconsults with his current lover, Marie, about his encounters with Mikhail. She warns him that Mikhail could be an epileptic. However, she also advises him to search for the Zahir as is his desire, even though she would prefer him to stay with her.\n\nThe narrator eventually decides to go in search of his Zahir. As it was Esther who had initially brought Mikhail from Kazakhstan to France, the protagonist suspects that she may in fact be in Kazakhstan. At first, he is curious about what made Esther leave, but later he realizes that troubles in her relationship with her husband may have been a major reason. As he discovers, she was interested in getting to know herself through the making of carpets. Eventually the narrator meets his Zahir and the outcome of this meeting constitutes the climax of the book. Through the narrator's journey from Paris to Kazakhstan, Coelho explores the various meanings of love and life.\n\nIn a recurring theme in the book, Coelho compares marriage with a set of railway tracks which stay together forever but fail to come any closer. The novel is a journey from a stagnant marriage and love to the realization of unseen but ever increasing attraction between two souls.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167061", "title": "Justin Welch", "text": "Justin Steven Welch (born 4 December 1972) is an English musician, best known as the drummer in Elastica, Suede, and later the drummer in Lush.\n\nWelch moved to London in his late teens and studied at London's Drumtech drum school.

The canvases were produced in 1732\u201334, then engraved in 1734 and published in print form in 1735. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam). The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display for a short period each day.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard.\n\nIn the first painting, Tom has come into his fortune on the death of his miserly father. While the servants mourn, he is measured for new clothes. Although he has had a common-law marriage with her, he now rejects the hand of his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, Sarah Young, whom he had promised to marry (she holds his ring and her mother holds his love letters). He pays her off, but she still loves him, as becomes clear in the fourth painting. Evidence of the father's miserliness abound: his portrait above the fireplace shows him counting money; symbols of hospitality (a jack and spit) have been locked up at upper right; the coat of arms shows three clamped vises with the motto \"Beware\"; a half-starved cat reveals the father kept little food in the house, while lack of ashes in the fireplace demonstrates that he rarely spent money on wood to heat his home. The engraving (right), which is reversed left-to-right compared to the painting, shows the father went so far as to resole his shoes with a piece of leather cut from a Bible cover.\nIn the second painting, Tom is at his morning lev\u00e9e in London, attended by musicians and other hangers-on all dressed in expensive costumes. Surrounding Tom from left to right: a music master at a harpsichord, who was supposed to represent George Frideric Handel; a fencing master; a quarterstaff instructor; a dancing master with a violin; a landscape gardener, Charles Bridgeman; an ex-soldier offering to be a bodyguard; a bugler of a fox hunt club. At lower right is a jockey with a silver trophy. The quarterstaff instructor looks disapprovingly on both the fencing and dancing masters. Both masters appear to be in the \"French\" style, which was a subject Hogarth loathed. Upon the wall, between paintings of roosters (emblems of cockfighting), there is a painting of the Judgement of Paris.\n\nThe third painting depicts a wild party or orgy underway at a brothel. The prostitutes are stealing the drunken Tom's watch. On the floor at bottom right is a night watchman's staff and lantern \u2014 souvenirs of Tom's 'wild night' on the town. The scene takes place at the Rose Tavern, a famous brothel in Covent Garden. The prostitutes have black spots on their faces to cover syphilitic sores. \nIn the fourth, he narrowly escapes arrest for debt by Welsh bailiffs (as signified by the leeks, a Welsh emblem, in their hats) as he travels in a sedan chair to a party at St. James's Palace to celebrate Queen Caroline's birthday on Saint David's Day (Saint David is the patron saint of Wales). On this occasion he is saved by the intervention of Sarah Young, the girl he had earlier rejected; she is apparently a dealer in millinery. In comic relief, a man filling a street lantern spills the oil on Tom's head. This is a sly reference to how blessings on a person were accompanied by oil poured on the head; in this case, the 'blessing' being the 'saving' of Tom by Sarah, although Rakewell, being a rake, will not take the moral lesson to heart. In the engraved version, lightning flashes in the sky and a young pickpocket has just emptied Tom's pocket. The painting, however, shows the young thief stealing Tom's cane, and has no lightning.\nIn the fifth, Tom attempts to salvage his fortune by marrying a rich but aged and ugly old maid at St Marylebone. In the background, Sarah arrives, holding their child while her indignant mother struggles with a guest. It looks as though Tom's eyes are already upon the pretty maid to his new wife's left during the nuptials. \nThe sixth painting shows Tom pleading for the assistance of the Almighty in a gambling den at White's club in Soho after losing his reacquired wealth. Neither he nor the other obsessive gamblers seem to have noticed a fire that is breaking out behind them.\nAll is lost by the seventh painting, and Tom is incarcerated in the notorious Fleet debtors' prison. He ignores the distress of both his angry new wife and faithful Sarah, who cannot help him this time. Both the beer-boy and jailer demand money from him. Tom begins to go mad, as indicated by both a telescope for celestial observation poking out of the barred window (an apparent reference to the longitude rewards offered by the British government) and an alchemy experiment in the background. Beside Tom is a rejected play; another inmate is writing a pamphlet on how to solve the national debt. Above the bed at right is an apparatus for wings, which is more clearly seen in the engraved version at the left.\nFinally insane and violent, in the eighth painting he ends his days in Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam), London's infamous mental asylum. Only Sarah Young is there to comfort him, but Rakewell continues to ignore her. While some of the details in these pictures may appear disturbing to 21st-century eyes, they were commonplace in Hogarth's day. For example, the fashionably dressed women in this last painting have come to the asylum as a social occasion, to be entertained by the bizarre antics of the inmates.\nHogarth published engravings of the paintings on 25 June 1735, the day that the Engravers' Copyright Act became law. The composition of several of the engravings is reversed from the paintings, due to the printing process.\n\nGavin Gordon composed a 1935 ballet titled \"The Rake's Progress\", based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1945 British comedy-drama film \"The Rake's Progress\", released in the US as \"Notorious Gentleman\", is loosely based on the paintings.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film \"Bedlam\", produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by \"A Rake's Progress\". Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera \"The Rake's Progress\", with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of \"The Rake's Progress\"; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nIn 2012, English artist Grayson Perry created a series of tapestries named \"The Vanity of Small Differences\", an adaptation of Hogarth's originals.\n\nIn 2014 Ulrike Theusner created a version with eight paintings accompanied by copper engravings on the same themes.\n\nThe British artist Henry Hudson depicted the rake in his 2015 show at the Sotheby's S2 gallery.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167095", "title": "Flashing arrow", "text": "A flashing arrow is a type of emphasized foreshadowing, an audiovisual cue used in films and similar visual media to bring the attention of the audience to a particular object or situation, which will later be referred to or used in the advancement of plot. In an extreme example, it could literally be a flashing arrow pointing at the object, but the term is usually metaphorical, referring to visual focus and/or accompanying sound effects or music. The term is often used disapprovingly, in reference to works for unsophisticated audiences.\n\nExample of this include: a camera close-up in a horror movie that suggests information such as danger from an unlocked door; a scene in an action film in which the hero is in a difficult-to-escape situation, a brief cut to a shot of the item they will use to save themselves; and recurring mundane shots of a person or thing, with the repetition indicating that it will become important later.\n\nAn example of repetition as a form of flashing arrow is in the film \"Natural Born Killers\" during a scene in which the protagonist stabs to death a young woman with a pencil; the pencil shows up in nearly every cut scene before the girl's death. In the film \"Stranger than Fiction\", the child with a bike and the bus driver appear in numerous scenes before both of them become a factor in Harold Crick's \"death\".\n\nA literal flashing arrow is used occasionally, such as in the 1981 film \"Student Bodies\" to mock it as a clich\u00e9. This is mentioned in \"Everything Bad Is Good for You\", where the authors says works that have little use of this and require figuring things out yourself have a more deductive viewer base. Another example is in the anime \"Ouran High School Host Club\", where it is used repeatedly, for instance in the first episode, in which a flashing arrow and high-pitched beeping noise indicate a vase that a character breaks later in the scene.\n\nThe technique is sometimes used in other media as well. With the more limited cinematic framing options of video games, the important object or clue may itself glow or flash to draw attention to it. In comics, the technique may be performed by including a single panel focusing on the object, or by a literal arrow pointing to it.\n\nChekhov's gun\n\n"}, {"id": "2167097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167097", "title": "Satomi Ishihara", "text": ", better known by her stage name , is a Japanese actress from Tokyo.\n\nSatomi Ishihara was born on December 24, 1986 in Tokyo.

The capacity is 7,500 seats. The stadium is in the downtown of Ioannina. The highest attendance (14,557 fans) was in a match with Olympiacos in season 1974\u201375.\n\nThe training facilities are in PEAKI. There are three football fields and a car parking with capacity of 500 cars.\n\nOver the years, PAS has competed in the Super League for a total of 23 seasons (plus 2017\u201318). The club has never won the Super League or the Greek Cup, but it has won lower division titles throughout its history and represented Greece in the 1979\u201380 and 1993\u201394 Balkans Cup tournaments. During its history in the Super League, the club finished 3 times in the 5th position (1975\u201376, 1977\u201378, 2012\u201313 seasons) and 3 times in the 6th position (1979\u201380, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316 seasons).\n\nOn January 31, 2007, PAS clinched a spot in the Greek Cup semifinals by virtue of an extra-time goal from Evangelos Kontogoulidis before a hostile crowd in Karaiskakis Stadium. With an aggregate score of 3\u20132, PAS Giannina also is the first ever lower division club that eliminated Olympiacos from the Greek Cup tournament.\n\nThe most famous player to have donned the blue and white PAS Giannina's jersey in recent years is defender Giourkas Seitaridis, who later played for Panathinaikos, FC Porto, Dynamo Moscow, and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as well as the triumphant Euro 2004 Greece squad.\n\nNational\n\n\nInternational\n\nBest position in bold.\n\nKey: 1R = First Round, 2R = Second Round, 3R = Third Round, 4R = Fourth Round, 5R = Fifth Round, GS = Group Stage, QF = Quarter-finals, SF = Semi-finals.\n\n\"Last update: 5 August 2016\"\n\nThe team is well known for its passionate supporters, mainly from the city of Ioannina and the whole Epirus region.

She was inducted into both the Canadian and American Racing Halls of Fame.\n\nBred in Ontario by Ernie Samuel's Sam-Son Farm, Dance Smartly was a bay mare with a distinctive white star on her forehead that earned her the nickname Daisy. She was by Danzig, one of Northern Dancer's most influential sire sons. Her dam was the Canadian Hall of Fame mare Classy 'n Smart by Smarten. She was trained by Jim Day.\n\nAs a two-year-old, Dance Smartly won three of five races, including the Natalma Stakes, and finished third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. She won the Sovereign Award for Canadian champion two-year-old filly.\n\nAt age three, she developed into one of the top Thoroughbreds in North America, going undefeated in the 1991 racing season. In her first two starts of the year, she was ridden by Brian Swatuk to easy victories in the Star Shoot and Selene Stakes. In the remainder of her three-year-old campaign, she was ridden by American Hall of Fame jockey Pat Day. Her victory in the Canadian Oaks, Canada's most important race for three-year-old fillies, was so dominant that her owner decided to race her next against the colts. Dance Smartly became the second filly (after Queensway in 1932) to capture the Canadian Triple Crown by winning the Queen's Plate, the Prince of Wales Stakes, and the Breeders' Stakes by a combined eighteen lengths. She next won the Molson Export Million, earning her first graded stakes victory as her previous races had been restricted to Canadian-bred horses.\n\nPreparing for the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs, Dance Smartly started favouring her front hoof and missed several weeks of training. Despite coming into the race with only one workout in six weeks, she won easily, defeating champion older mare Queena and Versailles Treaty. Track announcer Tom Durkin called her \"undefeated this year, and the undisputed queen of racing on this continent.\" For her 1991 performances, Dance Smartly was voted the Eclipse Award as North America's best three-year-old filly plus two Sovereign Awards as Canada's best three-year-old filly and the Horse of the Year.\n\nDespite being hampered by an injury to the suspensory ligament of her right foreleg, Dance Smartly raced four more times at age four, winning once against colts in the Canadian Maturity Stakes. She also finished second by a nose in the King Edward Cup Handicap and third in the Grade I Beverly D. She then retired as the number one money-winning filly in the world, having won on both turf and dirt, and at distances of up to miles.\n\nAs a broodmare at Sam-Son Farm, Dance Smartly produced a number of top horses, including the back-to-back Queen's Plate winners Scatter the Gold and Dancethruthedawn (who also won the Go For Wand Handicap), both by Mr. Prospector. She was named the 2001 Canadian Broodmare of the Year.\n\nDance Smartly was euthanized in August 2007 after suffering an irreparable injury related to an arthritic stifle in her paddock at Sam-Son Farm. She was 19 years old and not in foal at the time.\n\n\"Dance Smartly was a once in a lifetime horse,\" said Tammy Samuel-Balaz, the daughter of Dance Smartly's owner. \"She was magic and gave us incredible thrills as both a racehorse and a broodmare. While we were fortunate enough to have bred and owned her, she was truly Canada's horse.\"\n\nDance Smartly was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1995 and into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs, New York in 2003. In 1996, the Dance Smartly Stakes was created in her honour.\n\nDance Smartly was by Danzig, the leading sire in North America from 1991 to 1993. Her dam was Classy 'n Smart, who won the Canadian Oaks and was named the Canadian champion three-year-old in 1984. Classy 'n Smart produced several other stakes winners including Smart Strike, a grade I winner and two-time leading sire in North America. Dance Smartly's second dam No Class was the foundation mare of Sam-Son Farms, producing six stakes winners and four champions including Sky Classic.

It is the junction where the line splits into the line to Aberystwyth and the Cambrian Coast Line to Pwllheli. Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales. There is a single island platform.\n\nThe station is in Powys, about NE of the junction of three counties: the current principal areas of Ceredigion, Powys and Gwynedd, corresponding to the traditional counties of Cardiganshire, Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire.\n\nThe station is in the midst of the large Dyfi National Nature Reserve, near the Cardigan Bay coast. There is no settlement here but, contrary to common belief, it is not completely isolated: a footpath provides passenger access to and from the hamlet of Glandyfi in Ceredigion and a main road (the A487).\n\nThe station was opened in 1863 as Glandovey Junction. It was renamed Dovey Junction in 1904.\n\nThe station has been rebuilt twice in recent years: the original Cambrian Railways buildings were first replaced in the 1970s by a flat-roofed station building. This building was subsequently replaced in the 1990s by a simple bus shelter, having fallen into a state of disrepair and being far larger than required at this remote location.\n\nThe station platforms were raised in 2008 in conjunction with raising of the tracks, to reduce the likelihood of closure of this section of line due to flooding. The work was part of a major programme of work on the Cambrian Line, including ERTMS signalling to replace the previous RETB system and an extended (dynamic) passing loop at Welshpool to permit running an hourly service from Shrewsbury-Aberystwyth in the future.\n\nDovey Junction is often quoted as a defining feature of the Great Western Railway in Wales: its inheritance of junctions in unlikely and inconvenient locations.

It is long and carries the Cambrian Line. It is the longest timber viaduct in Wales and one of the oldest in regular use in Britain.\n\nBarmouth Bridge was designed by and constructed for the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway on its line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli. Work was authorised in 1861 and commenced in 1864. On 10 October 1867, the completed bridge was officially opened. Following the discovery of severe corrosion on underwater sections of ironwork, an intensive restoration programme was performed between December 1899 and late 1902. By 1980, the viaduct was under attack by marine woodworm, which led to concerns that it would have to be closed and demolished. Because of its value to tourism, it was repaired between 1985 and 1986 when it was closed for six months. Since 2005, weight restriction on the bridge have been relaxed, allowing locomotive-hauled trains to cross for the first time in two decades.\n\nThe bridge between and in Gwynedd, is used by rail, cyclists and pedestrians and is part of the National Cycle Network. To allow the passage of tall ships, the bridge incorporated a drawbridge, which was replaced between 1899 and 1902 by a swing bridge which is no longer operational due to a lack of demand. There is no provision for road traffic. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic up to 2013 but this has been voluntary since 2017.\n\nBarmouth Bridge crosses the estuary of the River Mawddach between Morfa Mawddach near Arthog on the south and Barmouth. The line was operated by Arriva Trains Wales until 2018, and is now operated by Transport for Wales, which provides connecting services south to Aberystwyth and east to Welshpool and Shrewsbury. The bridge is on the Cambrian Coast railway between Machynlleth and Pwllheli. It is long, and is made up of 113 wooden trestles, supported by cast iron piers. It is one of the longest timber viaducts standing in Britain, and is a Grade II* listed structure. \n\nMost of the bridge is built on top of a gravel bed, covered by shifting sand. The northern end of the viaduct, where the swing bridge is located, is next to Figle Fawr a rock at the base of the Rhinogydd mountain. Water passing through the channel flows at up to 9 knots (16.7\u00a0km/h). The first two spans at this end are built on the rock on cast iron cylindrical piers. The steel swing bridge section, which replaced the original drawbridge, was last opened (for testing) in April 1987. The installation of continuous rail across the movable section now prevents its movement, and the passage of tall ships in and out of the estuary.\n\nThe nearest road across the Afon Mawddach is the toll bridge at Penmaenpool about upstream, which can carry vehicles up to 2.5 tonnes. Heavier vehicles must use the first public road bridge, at Dolgellau, about from Barmouth.\n\nPedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles can cross the estuary via the footbridge on the bridge's eastern side. Since 1996, the footbridge has been part of the National Cycle Route linking North and South Wales. The footbridge is owned by Network Rail, and Gwynedd County Council contributes 10 per cent of its annual maintenance in exchange for a licence to use it.\n\nA bridge across the Mawddach Estuary at Barmouth was proposed by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway, who constructed a line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli. Authorisation for the railway was received in 1861\u00a0-\u00a02 and the detailed design of the bridge was started.\n\nBarmouth Bridge was designed by the civil engineers Benjamin Piercy and Henry Conybeare. Conybeare wanted a timber viaduct because it was about four times cheaper to import wood from the Baltic by sea than to construct an iron bridge. The decision was influenced by the incorrect belief that the estuary was free from marine borers, which attack and weaken the timber over time. During this era, timber pile viaducts were commonplace on coastal railways, particularly in Wales, although the bridge at Barmouth would be longer than most.\n\nConstruction began in 1864. The contractor was Thomas Savin, and the ironwork was produced by John Cochrane & Sons. Early on, progress was hindered by strong tidal currents which caused multiple failed attempts to sink the bridge's piers from barges. Between March and June 1866, staging was built from the northern abutment for the bridge, and the piers were dropped into the water and filled with concrete.\nWooden trestles were built on screw piles - wide with screw discs in diameter in groups of three piles per pier. Timber trellis girders, long and deep, supported the deck, with driven piles as fenders. The water around the trestles had a maximum depth of at spring tides but the river bed was raised by tipping stones to protect the piles.\n\nThe viaduct had a wooden drawbridge near its northern end allowing tall ships to pass upstream. The drawbridge span, which was carried on top of wrought iron piles, opened by tilting and rolling back over the track on four wheels, spaced apart, and nine steel rollers. When opened, there was a gap between the fenders. The drawbridge never regularly used as the opening of the railway effectively eliminated the need for traditional boat traffic.\n\nOn 3 June 1867, horse-drawn carriages crossed the viaduct. On 10 October, the bridge was officially opened, and steam-hauled services started.\n\nIn August 1899, Alfred Jones Collin, the chief engineer of the Cambrian Railways ordered underwater inspections to check the integrity of the drawbridge span\u2019s ironwork. They discovered that the supports were severely corroded, undermining its structural integrity and requiring the replacement of all the ironwork except for two piers. A temporary speed limit of , later reduced to , was put in place while repairs were made. Repairs started that December and were completed by the end of 1902. The drawbridge was replaced with a swing bridge with a single steel swing span, 41.5 meters long, which rotated around a central pivot, adjacent to a 36 meter-long fixed span. The spans are hogback lattice trusses, supported by pairs of cylindrical iron piers, and the turntable rests on a cluster of four piers.\n\nIn 1946, the bridge was nearly destroyed after a live naval mine was washed ashore close to it during stormy weather. According to reports, the mine had swept past one of the pillars, but did not detonate and the bridge escaped unscathed.\nFollowing the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, passenger train services declined after the closure of the Ruabon to Barmouth line via Llangollen and Dolgellau in 1965, causing all traffic to take the longer and slower route from Shrewsbury via Machynlleth and Dovey Junction. The old trackbed from Morfa Mawddach railway station to Dolgellau now forms the Mawddach Trail, a walking and cycle trail.\n\nBy 1980, the bridge was under attack from marine woodworm and the resulting damage was serious enough to threaten its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated that it would cost around \u00a32.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which resulted in the loss of traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth which was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. Gwynedd County Council opposed closing the bridge as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a \u00a32.5 million grant from the European Economic Community (EEC) to finance repairs, and \u00a34.6 million was spent on signalling improvements upon the line. The bridge was closed to traffic for six months during the repair works and 30 of the piles were replaced.\nOn 13 April 1986, a British Rail Class 37 diesel locomotive number 37427 was named \"Bont Y Bermo\" to celebrate the re-introduction of locomotive-hauled trains following repairs in 1985\u20131986. Locomotive-hauled trains were forbidden shortly afterwards after weight restrictions were imposed upon all bridge traffic. After major repairs in 2005, the weight restriction was relaxed and locomotive-hauled trains are allowed to cross.\n\nIn March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was established to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the bridge toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council is undecided as to how to pay for maintenance costs, which were \u00a339,405 for the year. This is problematic as revenue from tolls is insufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is no budget to employ staff to collect payments.\n\nGwynedd Council proposed closing the bridge to pedestrians and cyclists for cost reasons, as it needed to find \u00a39 million of savings by April 2016. Closing the bridge is one of over 100 cost saving options totalling \u00a313 million that were put to a public consultation in Autumn 2015. The council pays Network Rail \u00a330,800 per year towards maintenance costs. A petition calling on the council to \"cease considerations of closing this much loved walking and cycling route\" attracted 20,000 signatures in a week. In February 2016, it was reported that the bridge would not close.\n\nOn 4 October 2016, Barmouth Bridge was closed to traffic for a week following a fire on the structure. The following day, MP Liz Saville Roberts lobbied for its speedy renovation as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe viaduct celebrated its 150th anniversary in October 2017 with a fireworks display and special charter trains were run. The same month, Bill Kelly, the chief operating officer of Network Rail Wales, spoke of unapproved ambitions to spend around \u00a320 million to secure the long-term future of Barmouth Bridge between 2019 and 2024. In late 2017, an \"honesty toll\" of \u00a31 for adults and 50p for children was introduced with a troll mascot, and the old toll house rebranded as a \"troll house\".\n\nIn December 2018 it was reported that the future of the bridge is once again in doubt.\n\nIn May 2020, a \u00a325m restoration was announced by Network Rail.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167151", "title": "FDR Drive", "text": "The FDR Drive (officially referred to as the Franklin D.

There is a southbound entrance and northbound exit at ground level at 28th-30th Streets, where the southbound service road begins again. The northbound exit, labeled exit 8, serves 34th Street in Murray Hill, which is located four blocks north; the FDR Drive service road curves underneath the main highway until 36th Street. Another southbound entrance is located at 34th Street itself, and rises to the viaduct level.\n\nAt 38th Street, the northbound-only exit 9 for 42nd Street, serving Turtle Bay, splits from FDR Drive. Exit 9 continues as an elevated ramp until the intersection of 42nd Street and First Avenue, where it becomes the westbound lanes of 42nd Street. The FDR Drive dips onto street level and merges with the northbound service road. The southbound service road continues parallel to the FDR Drive, and the southbound exit 8 splits from the parkway near 41st Street. The southbound service road then becomes the eastbound lanes of 42nd Street.\n\nThe headquarters of the United Nations was constructed on a platform above the at-grade FDR Drive from 42nd to 48th Streets. The southbound roadway is inside a later structure resembling a tunnel while the northbound roadway is located just outside of the tunnel. This section is often referred to as the United Nations Tunnel, even though only the westernmost lane of the northbound roadway is under the structure.\n\nAt 48th Street, the FDR Drive emerges from the United Nations tunnel. A northbound ramp from First Avenue merges onto the northbound roadway. The southbound roadway contains two exits: exit 10 at 49th Street, and exit 11 at 53rd Street. At 54th Street, the road enters the Sutton Place Tunnel, which passes under apartment buildings on the east side of Sutton Place and York Avenue until 60th Street. In this tunnel, the southbound roadway is raised and runs over the northbound roadway for northbound access to and from the Queensboro Bridge interchange (exit 12). As part of the design in this area, numerous homes on the river were demolished and rebuilt or otherwise modified to accommodate the highway. At 63rd Street, the southbound lanes descend to ground level, at the same elevation as the northbound lanes.\n\nFrom 63rd to 71st Streets, the FDR Drive passes under a series of interconnected at-grade tunnels. The segment from 63rd to 68th Street runs under an annex constructed by Rockefeller University, while the section of roadway between 68th and 71st Streets runs underneath the pilotis of the NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital. Afterward, the FDR Drive continues north at ground level. There is a southbound-only entrance and exit, labeled exit 13, at 71st\u201373rd Streets, serving Lenox Hill on the Upper East Side. Another southbound-only entrance exists at 79th Street; there is no exit from either direction, nor is there any exit number reserved for this interchange.\n\nFrom 81st to 90th streets runs a final, enclosed double-decker structure. The southbound roadway is again raised over the northbound roadway in a short segment of the tunnel between 81st and 86th Streets. The promenade of Carl Schurz Park was built over the highway in 1939, near Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor's residence. There is a southbound entrance to the FDR Drive at the intersection of 92nd Street and York Avenue. York Avenue then parallels the FDR Drive until 96th Street, where York Avenue ends. The FDR Drive ascends onto a short elevated viaduct over the 96th Street interchange (exit 14) then descends to street level again.\n\nThe remaining portion of the FDR Drive to the 125th Street interchange (exit 19) is at grade, passing through East Harlem. There is a southbound-only entrance at 102nd Street, as well as a southbound-only exit at 106th Street, labeled exit 15. At 116th Street, there is another southbound-only exit and entrance numbered exit 16. When the FDR Drive reaches 120th Street, there are three northbound exits in quick succession: exit 17 for the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, exit 18 for the Willis Avenue Bridge, and exit 19 for 125th Street. Exit 17 also contains a southbound exit and entrance to and from the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, and exit 19 also hosts a southbound entrance. The FDR Drive transitions into the Harlem River Drive and continues north after 125th Street.\n\nA shorefront parkway in Manhattan along the East River was first proposed by Manhattan Borough President Julius Miller in 1929. The parkway would extend from South Street to 54th Street. The first sections of the East River Drive were constructed in the 1930s and were designed by Robert Moses. Moses faced the difficulties of building a parkway/boulevard combination along the East River while minimizing disruptions to residents. Many property owners along the East River Drive, especially in Midtown, opposed the boulevard unless noise mitigation measures were added.\n\nThe section from 125th Street and the Triborough Bridge ramp south to 92nd Street was completed in 1936. The sections from 92nd Street down to Battery Park (with the exception of a section from 42nd to 49th Streets, located underneath the headquarters of the United Nations) were built as a boulevard running at street level. The first \"downtown\" section of the boulevard, between Grand and 12th Streets, was completed in June 1937. Two more downtown sections, from 12th to 14th Streets and then from 14th to 18th Streets, were opened in 1939. A short connector from Grand to Montgomery Street was completed in May 1940, which meant that the boulevard was now continuous from Montgomery to 30th Streets. The next month, a large stretch from 49th to 92nd Streets opened. By this point, the only contiguous section that remained to be completed was the stretch between 30th and 49th Streets.\n\nAround this time, city officials started making plans for reconstructing existing sections of the boulevard so that several intersections would be grade-separated or double-decked. A plan to build a three-level section from 81st to 89th Streets was released in April 1940, followed by an East River Drive overpass over 96th Street in June. Due to a bulkhead restriction, a section from 51st to 60th Streets was already being built with two decks.\n\nThe section of the East River Drive from 23rd to 34th Streets was completed in October 1941. It was built on wartime rubble dumped by cargo ships returning from Bristol, England, during World War II. The German Luftwaffe bombed Bristol heavily. After delivering war supplies to the British, the ships' crews loaded rubble onto the ships for ballast, then sailed back to New York, where construction crews made use of it. The final part of the original boulevard, between 34th and 49th Streets, opened in May 1942. Future reconstruction designs from 1948 to 1966 converted the FDR Drive into the full parkway that is in use today.\n\nUpon the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1945, the East River Drive was renamed the FDR Drive in June of that year. The drive is now commonly called the \"FDR Drive\".\n\nAn elevated ramp between 18th and 25th Streets, serving as an extension of the highway south of 23rd Street, was completed in 1949, replacing an at-grade section. Another elevated highway above South Street, connecting the at-grade parkway north of Grand Street to the Battery Park Underpass and Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel at the southern tip of Manhattan, was completed in May 1954.\nIn Kips Bay, the FDR Drive is located on a viaduct between 30th and 37th Streets. The southbound and northbound roadways rise onto a viaduct separately between 28th and 30th Streets; the southbound roadway ascends onto the viaduct at 28th Street, followed by the northbound roadway at 30th Street, and the two roadways merge into a single structure at 32nd Street. At this point there is a two-lane shoulder on the left side of the northbound roadway, with one of the lanes cordoned off by a short concrete barrier. There is a provision for a southbound exit and northbound entrance at 30th Street, which was built in 1967 and would have connected to the Mid-Manhattan Expressway. However, after plans for the expressway were abandoned, this exit was never used, largely because there was already an exit four blocks north, at 34th Street. The unused exit was then blocked with a semi-permanent concrete barricade.\n\nExit 6, at 15th Street, formerly passed through a Con Edison substation, which handles most of the electricity for lower Manhattan. It was closed after the September 11, 2001 attacks after city and ConEd officials concluded it was too risky to allow such easy access to such a critical piece of infrastructure. The exit was permanently removed in 2014 after the New York State Department of Transportation received notification from the New York City Police Department that the exit would not be re-opened since the ConEd facility was deemed a potential terrorist target. East 15th Street, as well as a corresponding entrance ramp from 14th Street, were also closed east of Avenue C, except to ConEdison and law enforcement vehicles. All signage of exit 6 was removed in early 2016.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167158", "title": "Tsing Yi Town", "text": "Tsing Yi Town (Chinese: \u9752\u8863\u5e02) is located on the eastern coast of Tsing Yi Island, Hong Kong and is part of the Tsuen Wan New Town.

Along with the similarly large dinocephalia, the bradysaurs constituted the herbivorous megafauna of the late Middle Permian Period. In life they were probably slow, clumsy and inoffensive animals, that had evolved a covering of armoured scutes to protect them against their predators, the gorgonopsians.\n\n\"Bradysaurus\" was 2.5 meters in length and half a tonne to a tonne in weight. The skull was large (about 42 to 48\u00a0centimeters long), broad and rounded at the front. It was coarsely sculptured and knobby, with the sutures between the bones not clearly visible. The marginal teeth were high-crowned, with only a few cusps, which is a primitive characteristic. The feet were short and broad, the phalangeal count being 2,3,3,3,2 on the fore-foot and 2,3,3,4,3 on the hind. The whole body is protected by dermal scutes, although these are not as thick or heavy as in more advanced forms.\n\n\"Bradysaurus\" is the only member of the subfamily Bradysaurinae. It is the most primitive known pareiasaur and can be considered a good ancestral type from which the others developed. Its large dimensions show that, even very early in their evolutionary history, these strange animals had already attained an optimal size. Even later, more advanced forms, like \"Scutosaurus\", were no larger. The advantage of large size was to provide defense against predators and to maintain a stable body temperature (gigantothermy).\n\nKuhn 1969 lists no fewer than nine species for this genus, but this is certainly an excessive number. Boonstra 1969 distinguishes only four species on the basis of tooth structure, two of which Kuhn places in the genus \"Embrithosaurus\". The genera \"Brachypareia\", \"Bradysuchus\", \"Koalemasaurus\", and \"Platyoropha\" are synonyms of \"Bradysaurus\".\n\nB. baini (Seeley, 1892) is from the \"Tapinocephalus\" zone, Lower Beaufort Beds, Karoo basin, South Africa. This is the type species for the genus. The quadra-jugal region (cheek-bones) were only moderately developed. The snout was broad and rounded and there were 15 or 16\u00a0pairs of overlapping teeth in each jaw. This animal could be considered a generic early pareiasaur. According to Lee, 1997, the available material of \"B. baini\" lacks distinguishing autapomorphies or characteristics.\n\nB. seeleyi (Haughton and Boonstra, 1929) is from the \"Tapinocephalus\" zone, Lower Beaufort Beds, Karoo basin, South Africa. This is a less common form. Boonstra, 1969, considered this a valid species of \"Bradysaurus\" and Lee, 1997, considers this animal a sister group to more advanced pareiasaurs. \"B. seelyi\" seems to be closely related to \"Nochelesaurus\" and \"Embrithosaurus\". In contrast to the more numerous but similarly sized \"B. baini\", the cheekbones were heavy and greatly enlarged. There were 19 or 20 pairs of strongly overlapping teeth on each jaw.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167199", "title": "Warning system", "text": "Warning system is any system of biological or technical nature deployed by an individual or group to inform of a future danger.

Historically in Lancashire, it is southeast of Bolton, west of Radcliffe and west-southwest of Bury.\nDuring the 19th century, the population was employed in cotton mills, paper mills, bleach works, terracotta works, a rope works and in numerous collieries.\n\nLever is derived from the Old English \"laefre\", which means place where the rushes grow. The township was recorded as Parua Lefre in 1212, from the Latin, \"parva\" meaning little. The name was recorded in several ways, Lethre in 1221, Leuere in 1278, Leuir in 1282, Leuer in 1291 and Leyver in 1550.\n\nThe manor of Little Lever was part of the barony of Manchester and during the Middle Ages was governed by the manorial land holder, the Baron of Manchester. Records show that in the time of Henry II, a parcel of land within the manor, consisting of one moiety was rented to Alexander son of Uvieth for a \u00bd mark and a hawk (12d).\n\nIn 1212, the village was assessed as four oxgangs of land and was held in moieties, but the name of the tenant is not listed. In 1227 Adam de Radcliffe was called upon by Robert Grelley, the Baron of Manchester to perform suit every two weeks at his court of Manchester regarding the village of Little Lever. In 1246 the lord of the manor was recorded as Leising de Lever.\n\nDuring the next hundred years, the de Lever family took control of the moieties. In around 1320, the manor was jointly controlled in homage by William de Ratcliffe and William de Lever. This homage each year amounted to 4d and a fee of 6s 8d and 1s for provision of future for the sergeant and foresters, a total of 8s. Several cases were brought before courts by family members trying to take control of the manor. A settlement in 1331, found in favour of Adam, son of Ellis de Lever and the family line was settled. There are no records about the ownership until 1448, when Henry Lever the elder owed rent of 25s (\u00a31.25p) on the village.\n\nIn 1623 the Bubonic Plague killed a third of the village population.\n\nBy 1666, the village had sixty hearths liable to tax. Records show the land used for agriculture and the main landowner was John Andrews, who had the only large house in the village which contained 9 hearths. The manor house, Little Lever Hall, built of wood and plaster was destroyed in the 18th century. It was a seat of the Levers in 1567 and after that the Andrews who inherited the Lever's estate in Rivington.\n\nThere is a record of a coal pit in 1320.\n\nRecords show there were fulling-mills in Little Lever before 1559. The holding of Adam Byrom of Salford who died in 1559 was described as \"an estate of eight messuages, a moiety of two fulling-mills etc., in Little Lever\", his three-year-old grandson Ralph, was his heir. Adam's great-grandson Ralph Byrom, died in 1599 without issue, leaving his fourteen-year-old brother Adam as heir to twelve messuages, half a water-mill and fulling-mill in Little Lever (or possibly Darcy Lever).\n\nIn the 1800s the coal mining industry was spread throughout the area including Kearsley, Outwood, Radcliffe and Little Lever. In 1880 there were ten working pits listed for Little Lever: Bally, Harpurfold, Middle Bents and Stopes, owned by Thomas Fletcher and Sons, Ladyshore, Owl Hole and Victoria owned by John Fletcher and Dingle, Farnworth Bridge and New Rivin, owned by Andrew Knowles and Sons.\n\nThe Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal passed alongside the village, where two basins were used to load coal from the Ladyshore Colliery (originally named, Back o' th' Barn, opened 1830). The pit closed in 1949 and the colliery offices (now a house) and the stables survive.\n\nBricks and tiles were made along Stopes Road. The industry today is much smaller but Tarmac Topblock still run Crowthers Brickworks. Originally the site of a much larger traditional clay brick works, it is currently used for the production of building materials and produces lightweight blocks for the construction industry. The manufacture of terracotta in the North of England was pioneered by Colonel John Fletcher at his Ladyshore Terracotta Works. The Ladyshore Coal and Terracotta Company supplied the terracotta used in the building in St Stephen and All Martyrs' Church, Lever Bridge.\n\nThere were several paper mills situated in the area, two in Little Lever. Creams Mill, founded by James Crompton 1677 and Grundy's Mill, founded by James Grundy in 1760. The name Creams was given by Adam Crompton II who said it described the paper being made.\n\nThe three arms of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal meet at Nob End which is approximately , southwest of the village, making Little Lever a convenient place for lodging and refreshment in the days when the canal was in operation. The proximity of the canal and the coal industry led to the establishment of a small boat-building industry for coal transportation. In part 2 of his book, Waterson (the last of 5 generations of boat builders) describes working on the canal.\n\nThere was a small chemical works on the outskirts of the village and major chemical works along the canal at Nob End, Farnworth. Bridson, Thomas Ridgeway & Sons, operated the Lever Bank Bleach Works, (later becoming Smith, J. Junior & Company). Wilson Edward & Company operated the Prestolee Alkali Works between 1875 and 1884. The largest and longest lasting chemical works in Little Lever was in Church Street, located on land between the canal and Lever Hall Farm. It was established in 1868 by F.W. Graham, but failed and was rescued by a partnership of Crompton and Potter. Edmund Peel Potter became the sole owner and expanded the business, manufacturing acid and alkali for the cloth bleaching industry. However, it was the production of sodium and potassium bichromate that made Potter's a world leader and by about 1900 the firm had become a limited company. In 1951 Potter's amalgamated with the Eaglescliffe Chemical Company. The company closed in 1969 when it was owned by Albright & Wilson. Until closure Potter family members remained in senior management positions. Edmund Peel Potter was prominent in the local community and endowed a hospital on Chorley New Road, Bolton in pre-NHS years. His son Colonel Colin Kynaston Potter served with distinction in the Boer and First World Wars.(Ref.Papers in Little Lever library reference section)\n\nLittle Lever was a hamlet, bounded on three sides, by the water courses, the River Irwell, the River Croal and Blackbrook. In 1901 it covered including 37 of inland waterway. In the 2001 Census it is listed as having 1,188\u00a0acres (481 hectares).\n\nHistorically a part of the hundred of Salford in the county of Lancashire, until the 19th century, Little Lever was a township and chapelry in the ecclesiastical parish of Deane, in Lancashire.\n\nThe Bolton Poor Law Union was established in 1837 under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and was administered as the Board of Guardians. It took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in Little Lever and neighbouring townships and chapelries. The Guardians made use of the workhouses at Fletcher Street in Great Bolton and Goose Cote Hill in Turton until in 1861, when a purpose built union workhouse was opened at Fishpool in Farnworth.\n\nIn 1872, the village was governed by a local board of health until 1894 when Little Lever Urban District was formed. The council consisted of twelve members elected from the four wards, Church, Ladyshore, Stopes and West.\n\nIn 1974, local government reorganization made Little Lever a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, Greater Manchester, and is represented on the borough council by three councilors as part of a ward which also covers Darcy Lever. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 12,799.\n\nIt is represented in the United Kingdom Parliament as part of the Bolton South East constituency. As from the 2019 election, the Member of Parliament for the constituency was Yasmin Qureshi.\n\nThe last UK Census in 2001, gives the population as 11,505, with a population density of 25 persons per hectare. This figure is significantly higher than Bolton (18.7 per hectare) and is almost six times the average population density of England and Wales (3.5 per hectare). The Census also shows that the population has a population split of almost equal numbers of males and females which is uncommon in the area.\n\nThe population has changed dramatically since the turn of the 20th century, at that time the majority of the population was employed in the labour-intensive areas of coal mining, canal working and the other mill/factory industries. Today the population is more sedentary, employed in other sectors, as Little Lever has little left in the way of industry. Many people today commute out of Little Lever to nearby Bolton, Radcliffe, and Manchester to carry on employment. The main employer within the village is the wholesale/retail sector.\n\nThe 2001 census shows approximately 8,000 persons have employment (the majority of the others are children or retired persons), it shows how the main areas of employment break down in terms of socio/economic grouping and employment sector (three top groups only shown).\n\nOver the past 20 years, the population has undergone changes and now reflects a more diverse ethnic makeup. The following table compiled from the 2001 Census shows the ethnic makeup and how the ethnic population compares with the figures for Bolton and England.\n\nThe village lay at the junction of three roads, the road between Farnworth and the adjoining hamlet of Nob End which continued to Radcliffe (A6053) and the road to Bolton (B6209) now replaced by the (A665) as the main route out of Little Lever. Later the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal provided direct links to Manchester, Bolton and Bury. There was a railway line from Bury to Bolton via Little Lever (with a station at Bradley Fold) though this was closed in 1970. The nearest railway station is Moses Gate, and Metrolink serves the nearby Radcliffe stop.\n\nThe town is served by First, Diamond, and Cumfybus buses from Bolton, Bury, Radcliffe, and Farnworth.\n\nLittle Lever's past is marked by cotton spinning, textile manufacture, paper making and coal mining.\n\nIn the early days, water was obtained from local sources and some shallow wells driven into the underlying sandstone. As the industry took a hold, more water and from a reliable source was required. In 1872, the Bury Improvement Act allowed the Bury Improvement Commissioners to take over Bury, Radcliffe, (who supplied Little Lever), Haslingden and Rawtenstall Waterworks Companies, in 1876, the Commissioners were replaced by Bury Borough Council.\n\nBury and District Joint Water Board was set up in 1900 with responsibility for Bury County Borough, the municipal boroughs of Haslingden, Radcliffe and Rawtenstall and the urban districts of Kearsley, Little Lever, Ramsbottom and Tottington). The name was changed in 1935 to the Irwell Valley Water Board and then in 1962, under the Bolton Water Order 1962, was replaced by Bolton Borough Council. In 1974 with the changes in local government, the whole was replaced by the North West Water Authority.\n\nThere are seven schools in Little Lever, controlled by Bolton Metropolitan Borough education department: There are five primary schools, Bowness Community Primary, Masefield Community Primary, Mytham Community Primary, St Matthew's C of E Primary and St Teresa's RC Primary.\n\nThere is only one secondary school, Little Lever School, formerly a specialist language college which now focuses on Business and Enterprise, and there is one special needs school, Ladywood School.\n\nOther facilities include pre-school playgroups, nursery schools and a library which was built in 1939.\n\nThere is a purpose built leisure centre adjacent to Little Lever School with sports hall, gymnasium, squash courts, all-weather pitch and extensive playing fields. There are also facilities around the village for football, rounders, bowls and cricket. Little Lever Cricket Club is a long established facility which includes a social club and bar. The cricket team play in the Bolton Cricket League. There are also a number of youth organizations, a youth club, an old age pensioners' club, and a Women's Institute branch. There are several public houses and political, sports and social clubs.\n\nLittle Lever is located on the edge of Moses Gate Country Park, a park which spans the valleys of the River Croal and River Irwell.\n\nRingley Chapel was built in the Outwood area of the township of Pilkington in the ancient parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham which belonged to the Manchester Classis. Kearsley and Little Lever were in the Parish of Deane and therefore in the Bury Classis. For convenience, members of the congregation in Kearsley and Little Lever attended Ringley Chapel. At a meeting at Ringley on 12 July 1649, it was agreed that parishioners who wished to join the Ringley congregation should be allowed to do so and should be released from the Bury Classis accordingly. The religion at that time was Puritan and there was one well known nonconformist divine by the name of Oliver Heywood who preached to the wealthy families of the area such as Captain Peter Seddon. In 1667, he wrote and distributed copies of his book 'Heart treasure'.\n\nThe first church built in Little Lever was St Matthew's in 1791. The Congregational Church in Market Street was founded in 1857. In 1972, the Congregational Church closed, when it joined the Presbyterian Church to become the United Reformed Church.\n\nThere are several other churches representing different denominations in Little Lever:\nKing's Church Little Lever (non denominational) in Market Street was founded in 1982, Christ Church joint Methodist and United Reformed Church in Mytham Road formed in 2000 (from constituent chapels founded before 1892), St Teresa's Roman Catholic Church in Redcar Road, opened in 1975, and the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses, Mytham Road.\n\nThere are graveyards at the parish church of St Matthew, the King's Centre and Christ Church. The closed Congregational Church had a graveyard.\n\nThomas Lever, born here in 1521, was an English Protestant reformer and served as the Archdeacon of Coventry from 1560 until his death in 1577.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167201", "title": "Alloway Auld Kirk", "text": "The Alloway Auld Kirk, which dates back to the 16th Century, is a ruin in Alloway, South Ayrshire, Scotland (), celebrated as the scene of the witches' dance in the poem \"Tam o' Shanter\" by Robert Burns. \n\nWilliam Burnes, father of the poet, is buried in the graveyard together with his wife Agnes and daughter Isabella as well as two of his nieces. Alloway was where he and his wife had first raised their family before moving to Mount Oliphant and Lochlea, and William had attempted to maintain the grounds of the Kirk, which was already a ruin at the time. The original memorial stone has eroded and the present day stone differs in wording, memorializing both of Burns's parents, and includes an epitaph the poet wrote for his father. Burns's sister, Isabella Burns Begg, is also buried in the Kirkyard, along with other notable figures such as David Cathcart, Lord Alloway.\n\nFollowing restoration work, the Kirk and graveyard were reopened to the public by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond in April 2008. The church itself is a scheduled monument and the churchyard a Category B listed building.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167204", "title": "The Big Show (TV series)", "text": "The Big Show is an American comedy-variety-musical television series produced and broadcast by NBC for several months in 1980.\n\nThe series aimed to revitalize the moribund variety television genre, which had been in a downward spiral for several years. \"The Big Show\" took its title seriously, using a huge stage set (complete with a live audience and an ice rink and swimming pool) and filling a 90-minute time-slot (one of the only variety programs in American television history to run this length), with at least one two-hour installment broadcast. It was in many respects a revival and television adaptation of \"The Big Show\", which had aired on the NBC Radio Network from 1950 to 1951 and likewise was a big-budget, 90-minute weekly variety show designed to prevent old-time radio from fading into history.\n\nAlthough the first broadcast received high ratings, poor reviews and low ratings of succeeding episodes (typical of NBC during the Fred Silverman era) resulted in the program being cancelled after only a few months on May 8, 1980. The series nonetheless was nominated for six Emmy Awards, winning for Outstanding Costume Design.\n\nRegular performers included Joe Baker, Mimi Kennedy, Shabba-Doo and Pamela Myers. Guest hosts included Steve Allen, Nell Carter, Graham Chapman, David Copperfield, Geoffrey Holder, Gary Coleman, and Sid Caesar. Skaters who performed in the show included Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, John Curry, and Toller Cranston.\n"}, {"id": "2167210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167210", "title": "Dave Kushner", "text": "David Kushner (born November 16, 1966) is an American musician perhaps best known as the rhythm guitarist for the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver. Kushner has also been a member of Wasted Youth, Electric Love Hogs, Loaded, Danzig, Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro's solo band, Sugartooth, Zilch while he has also recorded with Infectious Grooves, Cyco Miko and more recently collaborated with Scars on Broadway guitarist Franky Perez releasing songs under the pseudonym of DKFXP, a combination of the initials of Perez and Kushner, as well as working with Indian singer and actress Shruti Haasan.\n\nKushner has also been writing and composing music for films and television, most notable the theme for FX series \"Sons of Anarchy\", titled \"This Life\", where he received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music in 2009 while in 2010 he received an ASCAP Award for the theme. He collaborated with composer John O'Brien on the music for the movies \"Four Christmases\", \"Couples Retreat\" and the ABC drama series Detroit 1-8-7 while he was also asked to develop a spin-off of \"How I Met Your Mother\" entitled \"The Bro Code\" by Fox creative director Dave Warren and \"The Simpsons\" segment director Ralph Sosa.\n\nIn 2009, Kushner was named \"One of The 50 Greatest Unsung Guitar Heroes Ever\" by \"Total Guitar\" magazine.\n\nKushner was born November 16, 1966 in Los Angeles. He attended Junior High and High School with Slash, frequently attending the shows of Slash's then band Tidus Sloan, and began playing in bands at the age of 16. He attended Musicians Institute in Hollywood at the age of 18 before signing his first record deal when he was 20. Prior to joining Wasted Youth, Kushner worked at Tower Video.\n\nKushner joined Wasted Youth as a guitarist but played bass on the group's second album \"Black Daze\", released in 1988, with the exception of the Van Halen cover of \"On Fire\" where he performed rhythm and lead guitar duties. Kushner left the group over a year later.\n\nThe group was initially formed as a cover band in San Diego by friends John Feldmann, Kelly LeMieux and Bobby Hewitt playing their first shows locally before relocating to Los Angeles adding Kushner to the group along with guitarist Donni Campion. The band named itself Electric Love Hogs in a satirical swipe at the L.A. glam rock scene of the late '80s. They signed a deal with London Records and released their only album \"Electric Love Hogs\" in 1992. The album was produced by Mark Dodson, whose production credits include Anthrax and Suicidal Tendencies, while M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee also co-produced two album tracks. Percussion for the album was handled by Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins.\n\nRobert Trujillo, then of Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves, contributed to the record while Kushner was asked to make a guest appearance on the song \"Punk It Up\" from the Infectious Grooves debut album \"The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It's the Infectious Grooves\", also produced by Dodson, released in 1991 before touring with Infectious Grooves for a few months.\n\nElectric Love Hogs went on to tour with Stone Temple Pilots, when they were known as \"Mighty Joe Young\", and L.A. Guns in the US and Ugly Kid Joe in the United Kingdom. The group disbanded in 1993.\n\nAfter the breakup of Electric Love Hogs in 1993, Kushner, Kelly LeMieux, also of Electric Love Hogs, and Kushner's former Wasted Youth bandmate Joey Castillo formed a new group called Lit. The group went through several lineup changes, with the final lineup consisting of Kushner, former Electric Love Hogs drummer Bobby Hewitt, Jar Gordon on bass, Amir Derakh on guitar and a singer known only as Eric. After a year and a half, Kushner was invited to join Geffen group Sugartooth with Lit being disbanded and selling their name rights to the well known band of the same name.\n\nIn 1995, he teamed up with Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves singer Cyco Miko on his solo album \"Lost My Brain!\" before going on to join Danzig. Kushner's tenure in Danzig lasted 9 months where he performed only one show at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1997, Kushner appeared on the compilation album \"Friends & Family, Vol. 1\" which featured music by Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves and Cyco Miko among others.\n\nIn 1998, Kushner joined the hard rock group Zilch, formed by former X Japan guitarist hide. Unfortunately, hide died before the release of their debut album. The group continued and eventually recorded and released \"Skyjin\" in 2001 and it was during this time that Kushner met Duff McKagan who, at the time, was touring with Loaded.\n\nIn 2001, Kushner became musical director for Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro's touring band following the released of his solo album \"Trust No One\".\n\nDuring a tour of Japan, former Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan, touring with his group Loaded, met Kushner who was at the time playing with Japanese hard rock group Zilch. After the tour, bassist Jeff Rouse left the band to rejoin Alien Crime Syndicate to release their new album \"XL from Coast to Coast\" with Mike Squires also leaving to join ACS becoming the group's second guitarist. Kushner and bassist George Stuart Dahlquist, of Asva and Burning Witch, replaced the departed duo. Loaded announced a tour of Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and Spain as well as shows in the UK however this tour was soon canceled after McKagan began collaborating with his former Guns N' Roses bandmates on a new project.\n\nAfter performing at a benefit gig for Randy Castillo in 2002, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum decided to form a new band after recognizing that their musical relationship was still very much intact. Initially they began rehearsing with Buckcherry duo Josh Todd and Keith Nelson, who performed with the trio at the benefit, but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at Hollywood's Viper Room, McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, after Kushner said they had known each other previously, who confirmed they were friends at Junior High and High School. After Kushner jammed with the group he was invited to join with Slash stating that \"Dave brought a cool vibe to what we were doing. There was no deliberation; that was it, it was a perfect fit.\" Former Guns N' Roses rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin also joined them for 2 weeks eventually suggesting that \"Duff and I will sing and we will just do a club tour in a van.\" Slash states in his autobiography that it was hard to tell if Stradlin was serious or kidding. After auditioning Kelly Shaefer (of Atheist/Neurotica), Stradlin left the group.\n\nWhile Shaefer's audition was unsuccessful, the quartet continued auditioning for a lead singer, with VH1 filming the recruitment process. The quartet were referred to under the temporary name \"The Project\" during this time. The resulting documentary was aired as VH1 Inside Out: The Rise of Velvet Revolver. A number of lead singers auditioned, including Canadian Todd Kerns (formerly of Age of Electric), Miljenko Matijevic (of Steelheart), Sebastian Bach (formerly of Skid Row), Shawn Albro (of U.P.O.), and Travis Meeks (of Days of the New). Myles Kennedy (of Alter Bridge and formerly of The Mayfield Four) declined an invitation, from Sorum, to audition, because he wanted to focus more on other projects. Scott Weiland had become friends with McKagan (via their respective wives) and had once played on the same bill as Kushner, when Electric Love Hogs supported Mighty Joe Young. Originally Weiland was wanted by the band but due to STP still touring he declined. After the band heard about STP's split in 2003, they were quick to get Weiland involved. Once he heard the material and offered his services as the lead singer, the band was formed.\n\nThe group released their debut album \"Contraband\" in 2004, debuting at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, and the follow-up, \"Libertad\", in 2007. The albums were produced by Josh Abraham and Brendan O'Brien respectively. \"Contraband\" album tracks \"Set Me Free\" and \"Dirty Little Thing\" appeared on the soundtracks to the movies \"Hulk\" and \"\" while they recorded a cover of Pink Floyd's \"Money\" and a new song entitled \"Come On, Come In\" for \"The Italian Job\" remake and \"Fantastic Four\" respectively. With their single \"Slither\", they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance and nominated for Rock Album of the Year and Rock Song \"Fall to Pieces\". \n\nWeiland stated on March 20, 2008 at Velvet Revolver's show in Glasgow that this would be the band's final tour. At the time Slash hinted in an interview with \"Classic Rock\" magazine that, contrary to Weiland's assertions, Velvet Revolver will continue beyond its current tour. When asked \"Will Scott be singing?\", Slash replied \"I have no comment on that\", and laughed.\n\nIt was announced on April 1 that Weiland had officially parted ways with Velvet Revolver. Later that month, Weiland performed with Stone Temple Pilots for the first time since 2002, kicking off their reunion tour.\n\nThe release of Slash's solo album, \"Slash\", and Duff McKagan's addition to the Jane's Addiction lineup, both in 2010, seemed to put future of the band in doubt. However, they remained optimistic about the future, with new songs written and plans to reconvene in 2011 while in September 2010, McKagan departed Jane's Addiction. Ultimately, Slash and McKagan officially returned to Guns N\u2018 Roses in 2016 for the Not In This Lifetime... Tour.\n\nOn June 20, 2009, Scars on Broadway guitarist and solo artist Franky Perez announced via his official MySpace that he was in the studio collaborating with Kushner. To date they have released three song for free via the Franky Perez official website under the pseudonym of DKFXP, a combination of the initials of Perez and Kushner.\n\nIn October 2009, Franky Perez stated on his Twitter account that he and Kushner were jamming with Weezer bassist Scott Shriner and his Scars on Broadway bandmate, drummer John Dolmayan.\n\nIn 2009, he played rhythm guitar with rock band Weezer when they performed \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" on Spike TV's Video Game Awards.\n\nOn September 8, 2010, it was announced that Kushner was to collaborate with Indian singer and actress Shruti Haasan on a new musical project. Haasan will be writing the lyrics with Kushner composing the music. On working with Kushner, Haasan stated: \"\nWhen the opportunity to work with US supergroup guru David Kushner came to me, I was really excited. I really loved Dave's song and felt a connect between it and my music, thereby making it a meaningful collaboration for me. As a singer, songwriter and musician and a rock-n-roll loyalist, this is a dream come true [...] Dave is an icon and it's an unbelievable opportunity for any musician. I'm also so thrilled to be able to express myself as an artist on a global platform of this caliber. To be the first Indian to get an opportunity like this to not just sing but also write the English lyrics for this track, is truly an honour\". It was later announced, on September 21, that Kushner and Dave Navarro collaborated on a cover of The Kinks' \"You Really Got Me\" to be used in a Hyundai commercial.\n\nAlongside Bob Thiele Jr., Curtis Stigers and Kurt Sutter, Kushner co-wrote the theme song for the 2008 FX television series Sons of Anarchy titled \"This Life\". In 2009, the song was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music but lost out to the theme for PBS television series Great Performances. In 2010, the quartet received an ASCAP Award for the theme.\n\nKushner was also asked to develop a spin-off of \"How I Met Your Mother\" entitled \"The Bro Code\" by Fox creative director Dave Warren and \"The Simpsons\" segment director Ralph Sosa. Kushner also wrote a song with composer John O'Brien, Franky Perez and Dave Navarro for a new merchandise line called \"Bartrock\" after Dave Warren wanted \"a song to tie in with the merch line\".\n\nIn 2010, Kushner announced that he removed the vocals and \"messed around\" with the song \"Beyond the Wire\", which he released with Perez as DKFXP, giving it the new title of \"Beyond the Snake\". The song appears at the end credits of the film \"Hisss\" featuring vocals and lyrics by Shruti Haasan. Four tracks by both Perez and Kushner will also appear in the film \"Hamill\".\n\nKushner has also collaborated with friend and composer John O'Brien on numerous occasions providing music to films such as \"Four Christmases\", \"Couples Retreat\" and, most recently, the upcoming ABC drama series \"Detroit 1-8-7\" which will begin airing in the fall season of 2010.\n\nKushner has been a longtime user of Fernandes Guitars and has two signature models based on the Ravelle available in forest green finish with cream binding and metallic blue finish with black binding. Besides his signature guitars he also owns Montereys and Vertigos from Fernandes as well as a Yamaha SAO 503 TVL, which is the signature guitar for Troy Van Leeuwen from Queens of the Stone Age. Lately Kushner's main instruments have been various Gibson models, such as the ES-335, SG and Les Paul models.\n\nDave uses a 12-space rack with a switching system that allows him to use whatever effects he would like in any sequence. Some of the effect pedals he uses most often include Line 6 DM-4, Boss Flanger BF-2, Boss Super Phaser PH-2, Boss Chorus Ensemble CE-5, Boss Digital Delay DD-3, Line 6 Filter Pro, Dynacord CLS222, Rocktron Hush II CX Noise Reduction System, Electro-Harmonix Micro synth, Boss Hyperfuzz, Line 6 delay pedal and a MXR Zakk Wylde overdive pedal. He also uses Dunlop programmable Wah Wah effects and Rotovibe MIDI controllers which are rackmounted.\n\nKushner mostly uses Bogner amplifiers during live performances, specifically an Ecstasy 101B amplifier that runs Bogner straight cabs fitted with Vintage Celestion 30 watt and Celestion Greenbacks 25 watt speakers. He has also used Mesa Boogie Stilletto Ace and Fender Super Sonic amplifiers.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167222", "title": "Ann Meekitjuk Hanson", "text": "Ann Meekitjuk Hanson (Inuktitut: \u140b\u14d0 \u14a6\u1580\u1466\u1529\u1483 \u1426\u140b\u14d0\u14f1\u14d0/an miiqitjuk hansun) (born May 22, 1946, Qaktut, Northwest Territories, now Nunavut) was the Commissioner of Nunavut.

He was called Phyi-glin-gi-grwa-pa in Tibetan, meaning \"\"the foreign pupil\"\", and was declared a \"bosatsu\" or bodhisattva by the Japanese in 1933. He was born in K\u0151r\u00f6s, Grand Principality of Transylvania (today part of Covasna, Romania). His birth date is often given as 4 April, although this is actually his baptism day and the year of his birth is debated by some authors who put it at 1787 or 1788 rather than 1784. The Magyar ethnic group, the Sz\u00e9kelys, to which he belonged believed that they were derived from a branch of Attila's Huns who had settled in Transylvania in the fifth century. Hoping to study the claim and to find the place of origin of the Sz\u00e9kelys and the Magyars by studying language kinship, he set off to Asia in 1820 and spent his lifetime studying the Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy. Csoma de K\u0151r\u00f6s is considered as the founder of Tibetology. He was said to have been able to read in seventeen languages. He died in Darjeeling while attempting to make a trip to Lhasa in 1842 and a memorial was erected in his honour by the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nCsoma de K\u0151r\u00f6s was born into a poor Sz\u00e9kely family, the sixth child of Andr\u00e1s Csoma and his wife, Krisztina Getse (or Ilona G\u00f6cz?). His name in English would be written Alexander Csoma of Koros and in Hungarian K\u0151r\u00f6si Csoma S\u00e1ndor where K\u0151r\u00f6si means \"of Koros\" (i.e., a praedicatum of nobility) and alternate continental forms include \"S\u00e1ndor Csoma de Koros\". His father served with the Sz\u00e9kely Border Guards. His early schooling was at the local village school. In 1799, he went to Nagyenyed (present-day Aiud) to join the boarding school \"Bethlen Koll\u00e9gium\". The education was free (so called \"gratistae\") in return for manual labor. Here he was influenced by the professor Samuel Heged\u00fcs. He left the school in 1807 and continued university studies, taking an interest in history, a subject made popular by Professor \u00c1d\u00e1m Herepei. In 1815 he passed the public \"rigorosum\" in his studies at Bethlen Koll\u00e9gium. A scholarship allowed him to continue to G\u00f6ttingen, where he began to learn English under Professor Fiorillo. Csoma de K\u0151r\u0151s also came under the influence of Professor Johann Gottfried Eichhorn.\n\nBetween 1816 and 1818 he studied Oriental languages. In G\u00f6ttingen, he was noted for being literate in thirteen languages including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, German, and Romanian apart from his native Hungarian. In his Calcutta years he also mastered Bengali, Marathi and Sanskrit. He returned to Transylvania in 1818. On 7 February 1819, Csoma met Heged\u0171s and informed him of his intent to learn Slavonic in Croatia. He left on foot for Agram and spent a few months there. He received the aid of one hundred florins from Michael de Kenderessy to help him in this journey.\n\nThe journey that Csoma undertook after leaving Croatia is reconstructed mainly from to a letter that Csoma wrote introducing himself to the British Captain Kennedy who detained him on entry at Sabathu on suspicion of being a spy. Csoma did not apply for an Imperial passport and obtained a Hungarian passport at Nagy Enyed and visited Bucharest. He had it signed by the General Commandant in Hermanstadt and went to Romania (then called Wallachia) at the end of November 1819. He attempted to go to Constantinople but not finding the means he left Bucharest on 1 January 1820 and passed the Danube by-Rustchuk and reached Sofia and then after five days to Philipopolis.\n\nCsoma de K\u0151r\u00f6s arrived in Edirne (Adrianopolis) and he wished to go from there to Constantinople but was forced by a plague outbreak to move to Enos. He left Enos on 7 February 1820 and reached Alexandria on a Greek ship. He reached on the last day of February but had to leave soon due to a plague epidemic. He boarded a Syrian ship to Larnaca in Cyprus and then took another ship to Tripoli and Latakia. From here he travelled on foot and reached Aleppo in Syria on 13 April. He left on 19 May, joining various caravans and by raft along the river going through Urfa, Mardin and Mosul to arrive in Baghdad on 22 July. He wrote to the British resident Mr. Rich and sought help in his travels. He was provided a European dress and money through a Hungarian friend Mr. Swoboda with whom he stayed. He left Baghdad on 4 September and travelled with a caravan through Kermanshah and Hamadan and reached Tehran on 14 October 1820. He sought help from Henry Willock who made it possible for him to stay on for about four months. He left Tehran on 1 March 1821, leaving behind his passport and papers and changing from a European costume to a Persian one apart from writing notes in Hungarian which were to be passed on in the event that he died on his way to Bukhara. He reached Meshed on 18 April and due to the troubles in the area he could not continue until 20 October. He reached Bukhara on 18 November. He initially intended to spend the winter in Bukhara but fearing the Russian army he left after five days and joined a caravan that passed through Balk, Kulm, and Bamian to reach Kabul on 6 January 1822. He left Kabul on 19 January and headed towards Peshawar. On 26 January he met two French officers at Daka, Messrs. Allard and Ventura, who joined him to Lahore. He reached Lahore on 11 March and left on the 23rd passing through Amritsar, Jammu to reach Kashmir on 17 April. Finding company to travel with he left on 9 May to reach Leh on 9 June. Finding the route to Yarkand risky, he decided to return to Lahore and on the way to Kashmir, on 16 July 1822 he met William Moorcroft, the famous English explorer. He decided to stay on with Moorcroft and joined him to Leh. Here Moorcroft introduced Csoma to George Trebeck. He also lent Csoma a copy of \"Alphabetum Tibetanum\" by Agostino Antonio Giorgi. He also helped Moorcroft by translating a Russian letter (from Count Nesselrode Petersburgh dated 17 January 1820) addressed to Ranjeet Singh into Latin. Before Moorcroft left Leh, Csoma requested him that he wished to stay on with Trebeck in Leh. He then joined Trebeck back to Srinagar on 26 November. He stayed on here for five months and six days during which time he took an interest in the Tibetan language and discussed with Moorcroft an interest in examining the contents of the books found in the local monasteries.\n\nMoorcroft recommended Csoma and wrote to obtain subsistence and support from the chief officer at Leh and the Lama of Yangla at Zanskar. Csoma left Kashmir on 2 May 1823 and reached Leh on 1 June 1823. From here he travelled to Yangla on the 9th and stayed in Zanskar from 20 June to 22 October 1824. At Zanskar he studied under a Lama. Towards winter he decided to move to Kullu and reached Subathu on 26 November. Here he was detained by Captain Kennedy who suspected him of being a spy. A letter of introduction and testimony from Moorcroft however clarified his position. It was not until May that the government response from Calcutta reached Subathu which absolved him of any suspicion from the British government. On 6 June 1825, he left Subathu and reached Pukdal or Pukhtar in Zanskar. He returned to Subathu only on 17 January 1827 with some regret that his Lama instructor was not able to give enough time and attention. On his return to Subathu, Captain Kennedy wrote to Horace Hayman Wilson at the Asiatic Society of Bengal that he wished to discuss literary subjects and Tibet. He also noted that Csoma was not in need of money, having saved Rs. 150 from the Rs. 500 advanced to him by the Government two years ago. He also noted that Csoma \".. declines any attention that I would be most happy to show him, and he lives in the most retired manner.\"\n\nDuring this period at Zanskar (he was the first European to visit the valley), he was immersed in an intense sixteen-month study of the Tibetan language and the Indo-Tibetan Buddhism at the core of its literature, with a local lama, Sangs-rgyas-phun-tshogs. He was one of the first Europeans to master the Tibetan language and read two of the great encyclopedias of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist literature the Kangyur (100 volumes) and the bsTan-'gyur (224 volumes) which contained translations of Buddhist books brought from India. From May 1827 to October 1830 he resided in Kanum in Upper Bashahr in the Simla Hill States where he studied the collection of Tibetan manuscripts he had amassed in Ladakh, living on a monthly stipend of Rs. 50/- from the British. With his dictionary and grammar complete, Csoma went to Calcutta to oversee its publication.\n\nIn the course of his travels Csoma used various names modified for local use. These included Sikander (from Alexander) with the Beg or Mulla suffix and Rumi, Roome, modified into Tibetan as Rumpa as a prefix indicating he was from Rome. He sometimes signed as Secunder Roome.\n\nIn 1831 Csoma joined the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. In 1833 he was unanimously elected as an honorary member of the Asiatic Society. In 1834 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society. From 1837 to 1841, he worked as Librarian of the Asiatic Society. In 1842 he planned to travel to Lhasa, but contracted malaria while traveling in the Terai and died in Darjeeling.\n\nCsoma lived as an ascetic. He often slept on bare earth and ate a diet of bread, curd cheese, fruit and salad or boiled rice and tea. He rarely ate meat and never alcohol. Csoma was known to abstain from drinking water for days. He could \"live in the most trying circumstances in the most difficult of climate and terrain\". He never sought financial assistance for his work.\n\nThe grave of Csoma at Darjeeling was marked by a memorial by the Asiatic Society of Bengal. It is included in the list of monuments of historical maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (Calcutta circle). A tablet was placed by the Hungarian government with the words of Count Istvan Szechenyi : \"A poor lonely Hungarian, without applause or money but inspired with enthusiasm sought the Hungarian native country but in the end broke down under the burden\".\n\nA project has been started to restore the old royal palace (Kharkongma) of Zangla where Csoma de K\u0151r\u00f6s lived and compiled his Tibetan\u2013English dictionary.\n\nHe was declared as a Bodhisattva (canonized as a Buddhist saint) on 22 February 1933 in Japan. A statue of him in lotus posture by the Hungarian sculptor G\u00e9za Csorba was placed on the occasion at the shrine in the Tokyo Buddhist University. On his 200th birth anniversary in 1984, the Hungarian government released a postal stamp depicting him and his travel. In 1992 a park in his memory was opened at Tar and inaugurated by the Dalai Lama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167226", "title": "Catriona Matthew", "text": "Catriona Isobel Matthew (n\u00e9e Lambert; born 25 August 1969) is a Scottish professional golfer who plays mainly on the US-based LPGA Tour and is also a member of the Ladies European Tour.\n\nCatriona Lambert was born in Edinburgh, and grew up in North Berwick.

This approach allows us to define rigorously the concept of resonance in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn general, the partitioning formalism is based on the definition of two complementary projectors \"P\" and \"Q\" such that \n\nThe subspaces onto which \"P\" and \"Q\" project are sets of states obeying the continuum and the bound state boundary conditions respectively. \"P\" and \"Q\" are interpreted as the projectors on the background and the resonant subspaces respectively.\n\nThe projectors \"P\" and \"Q\" are not defined within the Feshbach\u2013Fano method. This is its major power as well as its major weakness. On the one hand, this makes the method very general and, on the other hand, it introduces some arbitrariness which is difficult to control. Some authors define first the P space as an approximation to the background scattering but most authors define first the \"Q\" space as an approximation to the resonance. This step relies always on some physical intuition which is not easy to quantify. In practice \"P\" or \"Q\" should be chosen such that the resulting background scattering phase or cross-section is slowly depending on the scattering energy in the neighbourhood of the resonances (this is the so-called flat continuum hypothesis). If one succeeds in translating the flat continuum hypothesis in a mathematical form, it is possible to generate a set of equations defining \"P\" and \"Q\" on a less arbitrary basis.\n\nThe aim of the Feshbach\u2013Fano method is to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation governing a scattering process (defined by the Hamiltonian \"H\") in two steps: First by solving the scattering problem ruled by the background Hamiltonian \"PHP\". It is often supposed that the solution of this problem is trivial or at least fulfilling some standard hypotheses which allow to skip its full resolution. Second by solving the resonant scattering problem corresponding to the effective complex (energy dependent) Hamiltonian\n\nwhose dimension is equal to the number of interacting resonances and depends parametrically on the scattering energy \"E\". The resonance parameters formula_2 and formula_3 are obtained by solving the so-called implicit equation \n\nfor \"z\" in the lower complex plane. The solution \n\nis the resonance pole. If formula_6 is close to the real axis it gives rise to a Breit\u2013Wigner or a Fano profile in the corresponding cross section. Both resulting \"T\" matrices have to be added in order to obtain the \"T\" matrix corresponding to the full scattering problem : \n"}, {"id": "2167231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167231", "title": "Wilmington, Kent", "text": "Wilmington is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England.

In the 19th century Wilmington was noted for being surrounded by gardens and cherry orchards.\n\nIn the 1970s the village was bisected by the A2 dual carriageway.\n\nWilmington is perhaps most famous for being the childhood home of Mick Jagger, lead singer with the Rolling Stones.\nAn earlier resident was Sir James Whitehead, whose family grave is in the village churchyard. He was Lord Mayor of London c.1888-9 and he lived for a number of years in the Manor, which was an early part of the girls' school. Two daughters, Leila and Florence, lived at Hazlewood in Rowhill and they founded the mission in Broad Lane. \n\nThe nearest National Rail stations to Wilmington are Dartford, Bexley & Swanley.\nWilmington is served Go Coach route 429, Arriva Kent Thameside route 477 & London Buses route B12. These connect it with Bexleyheath, Bluewater, Dartford, Erith, Orpington & Swanley.\n\nWilmington Cricket Club has been a part of the village for over 100 years and has had many successes in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, playing at Lords twice and winning many competitions over the years. They currently play in the Kent Regional Cricket League and the home ground is in Oakfield Park.\n\nWilmington used to have a successful football club whose history, in the form of trophies and shields, is displayed in the Wilmington Pavilion on Oakfield Lane.\nIn 2014, Richard Moore, a resident of Wilmington, started a new Wilmington FC team playing in the North Kent Sunday League. In their first season they won the League Three title as well as the League A cup.\n\nThere are three secondary schools within the parish: Wilmington Grammar School for Boys (WGSB), whose students wear blue blazers, white shirts, grey trousers and different ties for each house within the school (these colours are red, green, white, black and purple); Wilmington Grammar School for Girls (WGSG) formally The Grammar School for Girls Wilmington (GSGW), where the uniforms are maroon jumpers and skirts and a sky-blue revere collar blouse; and the mixed-sex Wilmington Academy (formerly Wilmington Hall), whose pupils wear black blazers.\n\nWilmington Academy and 'Wilmington Boys' are situated near Common Lane While 'Wilmington Girls' is situated on the nearby Parsons Lane. The Academy was built in the mid-1970s on the site of Wilmington Hall Manor and is a specialist centre of excellence for both business and vocational courses. Wilmington Grammar School for Boys has engineering specialist status. Wilmington Grammar School for Girls specialises in mathematics and computing.\n\nThere is one primary school in the village and another in Joydens Wood Estate; a nursery school is situated next to Wilmington Academy.\n\nThe Dartford Campus of North West Kent College is accessed via Oakfield Lane, Wilmington, but its grounds lie within Dartford.\n"}, {"id": "2167232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167232", "title": "Cindy Bishop", "text": "Cynthia Carmen Burbridge-Bishop (born December 30, 1978) or Thai name Sirinya Winsiri (), is a Thai model, actress and beauty pageant titleholder of English, American and Indian descent.

M. Thackeray, in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nHe edited \"The Story-teller\", 1843, and in 1849 the concluding volumes of the \"Correspondence of the Fairfax Family.\" In 1846 had appeared his popularly written \"Life of Canning.\"\n\nBell's major work was his annotated edition of the \"English Poets\" (24 vols., 1854\u20131857; new ed., 29 vols., 1866), the works of each poet being prefaced by a memoir. For Lardner's, \"Cabinet Cyclopaedia\" he wrote \"History of Russia\" (3 vols., 1836\u20131838) and \"Lives of English Poets\" (2 vols., 1839).\n\nBell wrote also a continuation, with W. Wallace, of Sir James Mackintosh's \"History of England\" (vols. iv.-x., 1830\u20131840); and the fifth volume (1840) of the \"Lives of the British Admirals\", begun by Robert Southey.

He was a major benefactor to his home town of Cambridge, Massachusetts and a founder of present day Malibu, California. \n\nFrederick Rindge was also the only surviving son of banking and shipping tycoon Samuel B. Rindge and Mrs. Clarissa Harrington Rindge. Frederick and his wife, Rhoda, came to be informally known as the King and Queen of Malibu. Between 1905 and 1940 with an estimated net worth of between US $700 million and US $1.4 billion, the Rindge family was widely considered one of the wealthiest in the world.\n\nRindge was born in Cambridge, the only surviving son among the six children of Samuel B. Rindge (1820\u20131883) and Clarissa Harrington (Dec. 8, 1822\u2013Jan.4, 1885); his siblings, including a brother named Henry and a sister named Mary, all died of scarlet fever, also known as rheumatic fever. He grew up in the \"Rindge mansion,\" still standing at the corner of Dana and Harvard Streets in Cambridge, but spent vast swathes of his childhood very ill, condemned to bed with swollen joints, body spasms, a wildly irregular heartbeat, and other ailments. Bible stories were of some solace to him, with \"tales of men defeating long odds because God was on their side\" rooting him in faith and religion from a young age.\n\nRindge entered Harvard College in 1875, joining the Art Club, Glee Club, and Hasty Pudding Club, and rising to the top of his class as an inductee of the Institute of 1770, \"one of the most important social honors on campus\" whose purpose was \"to identify the one hundred members of each class most fit to join society, all by a process of cascading elections.\" His appointment opened the door for him to join the A.D. Club, \"one of the oldest and most exclusove final clubs on campus\" in which he met and became close friends with Theodore Roosevelt, whose conquer of his own health ailments inspired Rindge, leading to his realization that \"he, too, was strong enough to travel the world and seek out the experiences that would give him the sense of making up for lost time.\" \n\nRindge's travels began with a journey across the Atlantic on the \"SS Baltic\". He then traversed England, France, and Germany, among his many stops. Upon returning to America and Harvard, he soon fell ill again and was forced to drop out of school, moving back in with his family. He was so severely ill that his doctor suggested he might find a better chance of survival if he sought out a warmer climate than Massachusetts could offer, which led him to St. Augustine, Florida. As he was again on the upswing of recuperation, he explored the town, then quite remote, and even partook of some amateur excavation of long-abandoned native Timucua villages. Later, in Colorado, he would spend a brief period as a sheep rancher. \n\nIn 1883, Rindge inherited his father's estate, then worth nearly $2 million ($140 million in 2016 dollars), from his father's investments in textile mills and real estate.\n\nIn 1887, Mayor William Russell of Cambridge, a Harvard friend, requested Rindge's help in funding a new public library. Rindge responded in July 1887 with an offer of land and full funding for Cambridge's public library. Later that year he enlarged his offer to include three additional buildings: a new city hall (now the Cambridge City Hall), the Rindge Technical School, and a proposed high school (not built). He also paid the bulk of the costs for the Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church. Today Rindge is commemorated in Cambridge through the high school, Rindge Avenue, Rindgefield Street, and Rindge Towers, low-income apartment buildings.\n\nRindge moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1887. In 1892 Rindge purchased the 13,315.7-acre Spanish land grant Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit or \"Malibu Rancho\", in Malibu, California. He later expanded it to as Rindge Ranch. He and his wife, May, first stayed in a small cabin on it that had been built by one of the ranch's previous owners, Matthew Keller, naming it Oak Cottage. He then built a three-story Victorian mansion on the property in 1893, surrounding it with orange groves and vegetable fields.\n\nRindge founded the Conservative Life Insurance Company (now Pacific Life) and became vice-president of Union Oil Company and director of the Los Angeles Edison Electric Company (later Southern California Edison Company). His investments included land near Stockton, California and real estate holdings in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, and the state of Sinaloa, Mexico.\n\nHe was President of the Harvard Club of Los Angeles and a member of many historical, archaeological, patriotic, and religious organizations which mirrored his interests. A supporter of the temperance movement, Rindge reimbursed the city of Santa Monica for the loss of license fees when Santa Monica abolished saloons. He established the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Santa Monica. He wrote several self-published books which were spiritual and meditative in nature.\n\nIn 1887 Rindge married 22-year-old Rhoda May Knight (1864\u20131941) of Michigan. They moved to Wilshire and Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica and then built a home at 2263 Harvard Boulevard in Los Angeles, known today as the Frederick Hastings Rindge House; weekends and summers were spent at their Malibu estate. They had three children: Samuel Knight Rindge (1888\u20131968), Frederick Hastings Rindge, Jr. (1890\u20131952), and Rhoda Agatha Rindge (1893\u20131962). Samuel Knight Rindge married Agnes Marion Hole, daughter of Willits J. Hole. Rhoda Agatha Rindge married Merritt Adamson, and they built the Adamson House, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Rindges also had a vacation home in Marblehead, Massachusetts.\n\nFrederick H. Rindge died on a Tuesday at sunrise. He had fallen ill while visiting a silver mine in Yreka, California. His body was transported via train back to Southern California. A service was held at the Rindge home in West Adams Heights, followed by another short service after his funeral procession to his place of burial, Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167244", "title": "Alfred Charles Hobbs", "text": "Alfred Charles Hobbs (October 7, 1812 \u2013 November 6, 1891) was an American locksmith and inventor.

Hobbs (1843-?), Mary H. Hobbs, and Arthur Hobbs. Both of his parents were born in England.\n\nHobbs went to London as a representative of the New York company of Day & Newell, which was exhibiting at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Hobbs had brought with him his boss's (Robert Newell) Parautoptic lock, designed to compete with, and surpass, the locks available at the time in Britain. He was the first one to pick Bramah's lock and the Chubb detector lock at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and forced the lock manufacturers to improve their designs.\nThe lock controversy continues a subject of great interest at the Crystal Palace, and, indeed, is now become of general importance. We believed before the Exhibition opened that we had the best locks in the world, and among us Bramah and Chubb were reckoned quite as impregnable as Gibraltar\u2014 more so, indeed, for the key to the Mediterranean was taken by us, but none among us could penetrate into the locks and shoot the bolts of these masters. The mechanical spirit, however, is never at rest, and if it is lulled into a false state of listlessness in one branch of industry, and in one part of the world, elsewhere it springs up suddenly to admonish and reproach us with our supineness. Our descendents on the other side of the water are every now and then administering to the mother country a wholesome filial lesson upon this very text, and recently they have been \"rubbing us up\" with a severity which perhaps we merited for sneering at their shortcomings in the Exhibition.\nIn 1854 he was awarded a Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers for his paper 'On the Principles and Construction of Locks'.\n\nHobbs became one of the founders of the lock making firm of Hobbs Hart & Co. Ltd. The company started in 1851 and was formally registered as Hobbs and Co. in 1852. But by 1855 it had become Hobbs, Ashley and Company. The name then changed to Hobbs, Ashley and Fortescue, with an address at 97 Cheapside in London. Then for the next ninety years the address was 76 Cheapside in London.\n\nIn 1860 Hobbs returned to America and lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and went on to hold a dozen patents for firearm ammunition manufacturing.

The major obstacle to her eligibility to be empress consort was the fact that she was three years older than Emperor Meiji, but this issue was resolved by changing her official birth date from 1849 to 1850.\n\nShe became engaged to Emperor Meiji on 2 September 1867 and she adopted the given name , which was intended to reflect her diminutive size and serene beauty. The Tokugawa Bakufu promised 15,000 ry\u014d in gold for the wedding, and assigned her an annual income of 500 \"koku\", but as the Meiji Restoration occurred before the wedding could be completed, the promised amounts were never delivered. The wedding was delayed partly due to periods of mourning for Emperor K\u014dmei, and for her brother Ichij\u014d Saneyoshi, and due to political disturbances around Kyoto in 1867 and 1868. The wedding was finally officially celebrated on 11 January 1869.\n\nShe was the first imperial consort to receive the title of both \"ny\u014dg\u014d\" and of \"k\u014dg\u014d\" (literally, the emperor's wife, translated as \"empress consort\"), in several hundred years.\n\nAlthough she was the first Japanese empress consort to play a public role, it soon became clear that Empress Haruko was unable to bear children. Emperor Meiji had fifteen children by five official ladies-in-waiting. As it had long been the custom in Japanese monarchy, she adopted Yoshihito, her husband's eldest son by one of her husband's concubines (in this specific case, Lady Yanagihara Naruko). Yoshihito thus became the official heir to the throne, and at Emperor Meiji's death, succeeded him as Emperor Taish\u014d.\n\nThe Empress departed from Kyoto on 8 November 1869 for the new capital of Tokyo. In a break from tradition, Emperor Meiji insisted that she, as well as the senior ladies-in-waiting, attend the educational lectures given to the Emperor on a regular basis about conditions in Japan, as well as developments in overseas nations.\n\nOn 30 July 1886, the Empress attended the graduation ceremony of the Peeresses School in Western clothing, and on 10 August, she received foreign guests in Western clothing for the first time when hosting a Western Music concert with the Emperor. From this point onward, the Empress and her entourage wore only Western style clothes in public and in January 1887 she issued a memorandum on the subject, contending that traditional Japanese dress was not only unsuited to modern life, but that in fact, Western style dress was closer than the \"kimono\" to clothes worn by Japanese women in ancient times.\n\nIn the diplomatic field, the Empress hosted the wife of former US President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to Japan, and was also present for the Emperor's meetings with Hawaiian King Kal\u0101kaua in 1881. Later that same year, she helped host the visit of the sons of future British King Edward VII, Prince Albert Victor and Prince George (the future George V), who presented her with a pair of pet wallabies from Australia.\n\nThe Empress accompanied her husband to Yokosuka, Kanagawa on 26 November 1886 to observe the new Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers \"Naniwa\" and \"Takachiho\" firing torpedoes and performing other maneuvers. From 1887, she was often at the Emperor's side, in his official visits to schools, factories, and even Army maneuvers. When Emperor Meiji fell ill in 1888, she took his place in welcoming envoys from Siam, launching warships and visiting Tokyo Imperial University.\n\nIn 1889, she accompanied Emperor Meiji on his official visit to Nagoya and Kyoto. While the Emperor continued on to visit naval bases at Kure and Sasebo, she went to Nara, to worship at the principal Shinto shrines.\n\nKnown throughout her reign for her support of charity work, and of women's education, during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395), the Empress also worked for the establishment of the Japanese Red Cross Society. Especially concerned about Red Cross activities in peacetime, she created a fund for the International Red Cross, which was later named \"The Empress Sh\u014dken Fund\". It is presently used for international welfare activities. During the war, after the Emperor moved his military headquarters from Tokyo to Hiroshima to be closer to the lines of communications with his troops, the Empress, traveling together with his two favorite concubines, joined him in Hiroshima from March 1895. While in Hiroshima, she insisted on visiting hospitals, where wounded soldiers were recovering, every other day during her stay.\n\nOn the death of Emperor Meiji in 1912, she was granted the title by Emperor Taish\u014d.\n\nShe died in 1914 at the Imperial Villa in Numazu, Shizuoka, and was buried in the East Mound of the \"Fushimi Momoyama Ryo\" in Fushimi, Kyoto, next to Emperor Meiji. Her soul was enshrined in Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. On 9 May 1914, she received the posthumous name Sh\u014dken K\u014dtaig\u014d.\n\nThe railway-carriage of the empress, as well as that of Emperor Meiji, can be seen today in the Meiji Mura Museum, in Inuyama, Aichi prefecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167255", "title": "Habomai Islands", "text": "The Habomai Islands (Russian: \u0425\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0438 (\"Khabomai\"), Japanese: \u6b6f\u821e\u7fa4\u5cf6 (\"Habomai gunt\u014d\") or \u6b6f\u821e\u8af8\u5cf6 (\"Habomai shot\u014d\") are a group of islets in the southernmost Kuril Islands.

The islands were eventually annexed by the Soviet Union, which deported all the island residents to Japan. Moscow claimed the islands as part of a war-time agreement between the Allies (Yalta Agreement), which provided for the transfer of the Chishima (Kurile) Islands to the USSR in return for its participation in the Pacific War. However, Japan maintains that the Habomai Islands are not part of the Kuriles and are in fact part of Hokkaido prefecture. On May 26, 1955, the United States submitted an application for proceedings against the Soviet Union. As part of the proceedings, the United States questioned the validity of the Soviet Union's claim to the Habomai Islands.\n\nIn 1956, after difficult negotiations, the Soviet Union agreed to cede the Habomai to Japan, along with Shikotan, after the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries. As the treaty was never concluded, the islands remained under Soviet jurisdiction. However, the promise of a two-island solution (for the purpose of simplicity, the Habomai rocks count as one island) has been renewed in the Soviet-Japanese, and later Russo-Japanese negotiations.\n\nFormerly home to a Japanese fishing community, the islands are now uninhabited except for the Russian border guard outpost.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167256", "title": "Otto Kahler", "text": "Otto Kahler (January 8, 1849 \u2013 January 24, 1893) was an Austrian physician and pathologist born in Prague. \n\nIn 1871 he obtained his medical doctorate in Prague, and following an educational trip to Paris, returned to his hometown as an assistant to Joseph Halla (1814\u20131887) at the internal clinic.

Most of the area is administratively part of Serbia, but a small part on its western side extends into eastern Croatia. The area under Serbia forms one of the country's national parks. Sometimes it is also referred to as \"jewel of Serbia\" due to its largely pristine landscape and protection effort.\n\nIn Serbian, it is known as \"Fru\u0161ka gora\" (, \u0424\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430), in Hungarian as \"Tarcal\" (also \"Almus-hegy\" or \"\u00c1rpatarl\u00f3\"), in German as \"Frankenwald\", and in Latin as \"Alma Mons\". In Medieval Greek, it was known as \"Frangochoria\".\n\nThe mountain's name originates in the old Serbian word \"\"Fruzi\"\" of which singular form is \"\"Frug\"\"; and its adjective is \"Fru\u0161ki\", which was used for naming the Frankish people. The name of \"\"Fru\u0161ka Gora\"\" is \"\"Frankish mountain\"\" in English whose meaning is based on describing a historical event, viz, the mountain served as a natural border when Frankish campaigns were set up in the area. In the time of the Roman Empire, its name was \"Alma Mons\", meaning the \"fertile mount\". It is recorded that during the reign of the emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus, 276-282, who was born in the nearby Sirmium, first grapevines were planted on the mountain.\n\nThe mountain is a natural geological phenomenon as it is built from the rocks from almost all geological periods. It used to be an island during the existence of the Pannonian Sea. To the north, the mountain is bordered by the Danube river, while to the south it descends into the Syrmian lowlands. Lengthwise, it is approximately from east to west and is from north to south. Its highest peak is Crveni \u010cot at .\n\nFru\u0161ka Gora also divides Syrmia in two geographically distinct parts: Wine Syrmia (upper or mountainous) and Swine Syrmia (lower or lowland). Slopes of the mountain were established as one of the most prestigious vineyards in Hungary, ever since the 15th century. Golden age of the Fru\u0161ka Gora's viticulture began after 1699 and the Treaty of Karlowitz, when Ottomans were expelled from the area, until the late 19th century.\n\nIn Sremski Karlovci, a famous bermet is produced, a sweet, dessert wine with the protected geographical indication. It is recorded that the crates of bermet were used as the bribe, used by the Serbs to obtain certain privileges from the Austrian empress Maria Theresa. The wine was served at the Russian and British courts, and was on the wine list of \"Titanic\".\n\nThe slopes of Fru\u0161ka Gora are perfectly suited for growing grape arbors on there, and there are many wine-makers producing Traminer, Riesling and other wines in the region. Many people have been captivated by its picturesque beauty, due to its outstanding location which is famous for the peaceful and lucrative lifestyles of its inhabitants, and a perfect destination for sightseeing where tourists can relax and enjoy themselves in the spectacular natural environment. After the fall of communism, the Serbian Orthodox Church got 10,000 hectares restitution in the area of their nationalized properties.\n\nA national park Fru\u0161ka Gora was declared in 1960 and covers an area of . It is the oldest modern national park in Serbia.\n\nRich fossil fauna is preserved and almost 90% of the park area is forested. The predominant tree species include linden, oak and beech. The concentration of linden forests is highest in Europe. In time, linden became the dominant tree species, replacing formerly much larger and dominant oak forests, which are considered to be the autochthonous vegetation on Fru\u0161ka Gora. Altogether, 1,500 plant species inhabits the park, of which 200 are protected. There are also 400 species of fungi. Pannonian plant endemites include Tatar dock (\"Crambe tataria\"), broadleaf wild leek and Hungarian leopard's-bane. There are some 30 species of orchids in the park.\n\nIn 2016, massive cutting of trees in the park occurred, one of the largest in the mountain's recorded history. Over of forest have been cut. Park administration then stated that an autochthonous species of oak will be planted instead. However, they never planted anything and in the future years a thicket of the remaining black locust high shrubs grew instead. The administration, nevertheless, claims that the oaks have been planted. In the spring of 2019, aggressive cutting continued. Apparently indiscriminate cutting, without proper notifications what is being cut and by whom, destroyed hiking paths and orienteering marks. Also, the cutting sections of the forest weren't properly secured and some were completely wrong: beech trees have been cut even though the table stated that oak trees are being cut. According to the environmentalists, regular visitors and recreational athletes, the cutting was never so massive.\n\nTimber was transported outside of the park and was sold by the park administration. They responded that everything is being part of the planned action, that park has to think about the \"economic part\" of its existence (as the government is allocating small amounts of money to the park) and that trees will be \"replenished later\" because the cut ones were old. Members of the commission which participated in the planning said that even more trees should have been cut as 80% of the forest is over 80 years old. Only 3% of park's territory is under the strict protection (some of forest at Papratski Dol locality). The trees have been cut right along the border of this area, clearing the land which surrounds it. Citizens responded that national park is not a tree farm where the trees should be \"replaced\" and that protected forests can't be perceived as a feedstock. Director of the park said that he doesn't know how much trees they cut and planted, but numbers officially published by the park in 2018 show that in an undefined period they planted 50,000 seedlings, but 100,000 trees have been cut. Also, the park's plan for 2019 envisioned almost 100 time more money for cutting the trees than for the planting of the new ones.\n\nBy the 2010s, the predominant cultivated plant on the foothills of the mountain and the surrounding vast fields, became the rapeseed. In March 2020 it was announced that saffron was discovered on the mountain. There are some 20 species of saffron living in Serbia, but they never populated Fru\u0161ka Gora. The discovered species is woodland crocus, it was found on only one location, but already spread to several thousand individual plants.\n\nProtected insect species include Balkan goldenring, certain species of dragonflies and hoverflies, and Hungarian ground beetle, which already went extinct in some other European countries. Park is also the habitat of 13 amphibian species and 11 reptilians, of which 14 are protected, among them fire salamander and European adder.\n\nPark is home to 211 bird species. Symbol of Fru\u0161ka Gora is eastern imperial eagle, today with only 2 or 3 remaining breeding couples. There are 60 mammalian species, of which 17 are protected, including edible dormouse, European pine marten, European polecat and Mediterranean water shrew. Out of 30 species of bats which live in Serbia, 15 inhabits the mountain and all are under strict protection. In January 2018, for the first time after the 1960s, additional mouflons were introduced in the park. 30 animals were relocated from Slovakia, which raised the number of mouflons in the park to 70.\n\nThere are traces of human habitation in this area that date from neolithic times. Before the Roman conquest, Illyrians and Celts inhabited this region. In 31 AD, this area was conquered by the Romans and was included into Pannonia province. The Danube river was a border of the Roman Empire (limes), and on the northern side of the mountain several Roman border fortresses were built.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, this area was settled by Quadi, Huns, Goths, Gepids, Slavs and Avars. The Franks expelled Huns, Avars, Gepids and Lombards from this area and formed the southern border of the Frankish Empire, ultimately giving its name to the mountain.\n\nIt was later inhabited by Bulgarians, Pechenegs and Hungarians. In the 11th century, when Christianity was split between Catholicism and Orthodoxy, both communities had their churches in this region. A very important group of Serb medieval monasteries was formed on the mountain.\n\nSince the 19th century, during the Austro-Hungarian period, cities developed so as the trade and crafts. Settlements on the mountain itself developed, designed in the typical folk tradition. Two most distinct settlements, in terms of architectural inheritance, are Sremski Karlovci, which grew into the center of the political and cultural life of the Serbs in Austria and, later, Austria-Hungary, and Irig, one of the most developed Syrmian settlements since the 18th century.\n\nDuring the time, the area was part of the Hun Empire, the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the Gepid Kingdom, the Lombard state, the Byzantine Empire, the Avar Khaganate, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, Pannonian Croatia, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy, the Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, the Kingdom of Serbia, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, and now is within the Republic of Serbia.\n\nDuring World War II, this area was occupied by the Axis Powers, and Fru\u0161ka Gora was an important center of Partisan resistance movement. A liberated partisan territory was formed in this region.\n\nOn 28 March 2003, police revealed that former Serbian president Ivan Stamboli\u0107 had been assassinated by eight men on the mountain. At the time Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was still in power. It was later determined that Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had given the order for Stamboli\u0107's murder.\n\nEdre\u0161 Hill was used as the quarry by the prehistoric people for their tools. There are numerous Roman remains, like the fortress Acumincum near Slankamen and Bassianae, Roman town near Donji Petrovci. The town was fortified with the ramparts and square towers. Within the walls, the objects with the heating and sewage systems were discovered, so as the walls painted with frescoes and floor mosaics. In 1952, at the locality of Biki\u0107 Do, a Roman vault was discovered with 11,500 coins, including ones from the reign of Constantine the Great.\n\nAttractions from the later period include the , the only remaining part of the medieval fortress, the and Stra\u017eilovo, where the remains of the poet Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 were reinterred from Vienna in 1883.\n\nIn 1991, the population of the Fru\u0161ka Gora region numbered at 114,263 people. Settlements in the area include 23 villages, as well as several towns, which are located around the mountain. These towns are: \u0160id, Beo\u010din, Petrovaradin, Sremska Kamenica, Sremski Karlovci and Irig.\n\nThanks to its hospitable environment, there are also over a dozen Serbian Orthodox monasteries located on Fru\u0161ka Gora. According to historical data, these monastic communities were historically recorded since the first decades of the 16th century. Legends, however, place their founding to the period between the 12th and 15th centuries. The monasteries are concentrated in an area 50 kilometers long, and 10 kilometers wide. In the course of centuries of their existence, these monasteries sustained the spiritual and political life of the Serbian nation. In the eighteenth century the monasteries became the home of monks from Ra\u010da monastery in the Bajina Ba\u0161ta municipality by the Drina River. These monks were writers famous for their illuminated manuscripts.\n\nFru\u0161ka Gora Monasteries were declared Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990, and are protected by the state.\n\nOttoman documents mention 35 monasteries, of which 16 survived and are still active today. Due to the such large number of monasteries on one place, Fru\u0161ka Gora is colloquially called Serbian Mount Athos. The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church officially declared Fru\u0161ka Gora the Holy Mountain on 12 October 2003.\n\nList of monasteries:\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167279", "title": "Battle of Kolubara", "text": "The Battle of Kolubara (, ) was a campaign fought between Austria-Hungary and Serbia in November and December 1914, during the Serbian Campaign of World War I. It commenced on 16 November, when the Austro-Hungarians under the command of Oskar Potiorek reached the Kolubara River during their third invasion of Serbia that year, having captured the strategic town of Valjevo and forced the Serbian Army to undertake a series of retreats. The Serbs withdrew from Belgrade on 29\u201330 November, and the city soon fell under Austro-Hungarian control. On 2 December, the Serbian Army launched a surprise counter-attack all along the front. Valjevo and U\u017eice were retaken by the Serbs on 8 December and the Austro-Hungarians retreated to Belgrade, which 5th Army commander Liborius Ritter von Frank deemed to be untenable. The Austro-Hungarians abandoned the city between 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary, allowing the Serbs to retake their capital the following day.\n\nBoth the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs suffered heavy casualties, with more than 20,000 dead on each side. The defeat humiliated Austria-Hungary, which had hoped to occupy Serbia by the end of 1914. On 22 December, Potiorek and von Frank were relieved of their respective commands, and the 5th and 6th armies were merged into a single 5th Army of 95,000 men.\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The assassination precipitated the July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary to issue an ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on suspicion that the assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian government made the ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers in order to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of World War I.\n\nFighting in Eastern Europe began with the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia in early August 1914, under the command of Oskar Potiorek. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops assigned to the invasion was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because a large portion of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. On the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and U\u017eice armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Serbian Army was commanded by Crown Prince Alexander, with the chief of the Serbian general staff, Radomir Putnik, as his deputy and \"de facto\" military leader. Petar Bojovi\u0107, Stepa Stepanovi\u0107, Pavle Juri\u0161i\u0107 \u0160turm and Milo\u0161 Bo\u017eanovi\u0107 commanded the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and U\u017eice armies, respectively.\n\nThe Balkan Wars had only just concluded and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian Army had been stretched by the need to garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbs were dangerously short of artillery, and had only just begun to replenish their ammunition stocks. Their supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many soldiers lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional Serbian cap known as a \"\u0161ajka\u010da\". Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as the Serbs. They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. The Serbs had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro-Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry.\n\nThe Serbs beat back an Austro-Hungarian invasion in August, at the Battle of Cer. It marked the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in World War I. Potiorek was humiliated by the defeat and was determined to resume the assault against the Serbs. He was given permission in September to launch another invasion of Serbia provided that he \"[did not] risk anything that might lead to a further fiasco.\" Under pressure from the Russians to launch their own offensive and keep as many Austro-Hungarian troops as possible away from the Eastern Front, the Serbs invaded Bosnia in September with the help of Chetnik irregulars but were repulsed after a month of fighting in what came to be known as the Battle of the Drina. Bojovi\u0107 was wounded during the battle and was replaced by \u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107 as commander of the Serbian 1st Army.\n\nThe \"Armeeoberkommando\" (AOK) acknowledged that an undefeated Serbia severed Austria-Hungary's connection to the Ottoman Empire and prevented the completion of the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway. The AOK also realized that the Austro-Hungarian army's inability to defeat Serbia would discourage neutral countries\u2014such as Bulgaria, Romania and Greece\u2014from joining the Central Powers and would tempt Italy to open up a third front against Austria-Hungary. Nevertheless, the AOK was hesitant to authorize a third invasion of Serbia. This changed in September 1914, when Austro-Hungarian troops discovered a map in an abandoned Semlin bookshop, titled \"The New Division of Europe\". Originally printed in a Russian newspaper, the map was widely sold in Serbia and depicted the borders of Europe as they would appear following the war. Germany was to be divided into northern and southern confederations and Austria-Hungary was to be abolished, its eastern provinces given to Russia, Romania, the Czechs and the Hungarians, and its southern provinces divided between Serbia and Italy. Alarmed by the prospect of Austria-Hungary's disintegration, Emperor Franz Joseph personally authorized a third invasion of Serbia in early October 1914.\n\nHaving just repelled the Serbian incursion into Bosnia, the Austro-Hungarian Army regrouped and positioned itself for one final invasion before winter set in. Potiorek was again placed in charge of Austro-Hungarian forces and was given command of the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army. The Austro-Hungarian 5th Army was commanded by Liborius Ritter von Frank. In total, the Austro-Hungarians had 450,000 troops at their disposal. The Serbian Army had 400,000 soldiers ready to face the Austro-Hungarian advance. Potiorek appeared confident. \"Soldiers of the 5th and 6th armies,\" he said. \"The goal of this war is nearly attained\u2014the complete destruction of the enemy. The three-month campaign is almost over; we must only break the enemy's last resistance before the onset of winter.\" The Serbs were exhausted and demoralized. In a telegram to Putnik dated 27 October 1914, Stepanovi\u0107 complained that the 2nd Army did not have enough shells to resist the Austro-Hungarians effectively and requested that he be removed from his command; Putnik denied the request, but ordered all units to resist the Austro-Hungarian advance for as long as possible before retreating. This strategy had worked in Putnik's favour during the summer months, but heavy rainfall in September and early October had reduced all of Serbia's roads to \"muddy quagmires\" that made movement of troops, guns and wagons extremely difficult. Potiorek recognized that the Serbian Army was in a difficult situation; he was certain that a third invasion would bring him the decisive victory that he so desperately wanted.\n\nIn Vienna and Sarajevo, Austro-Hungarian officials began planning for the occupation and dismantling of Serbia. The country was to be plundered and its territory used to bribe the neutral Balkan states into joining the Central Powers, with the Romanians getting the region of Timo\u010dka Krajina and the Bulgarians getting Macedonia and southeastern Serbia. The Austro-Hungarians intended to annex everything west of the Morava River, as well as the cities of Scutari (Shkod\u00ebr) and Durazzo (Durr\u00ebs) in northern Albania. The Serbs living west of the Morava\u2014or \"the compact masses of the Serbian element\", as the Austro-Hungarians called them\u2014were to be expelled and replaced with Austrian settlers (\"colonisten\"), who would \"change the psychology [of the region], making Serbia more Habsburg [and] less Serbian in outlook.\" Ludwig Thall\u00f3czy, section chief of the Austro-Hungarian Finance Ministry, wrote Potiorek in October, recommending \"the West Europeanization of the Serbs with a strong hand\" as soon as Serbia was occupied.\n\nPotiorek planned to launch a converging attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Ni\u0161 was Potiorek's main objective; Ni\u0161 had been Serbia's capital since July and was a crucial transportation hub for its military. It also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture would effectively cut Serbia in two and scatter the Serbian Army.\n\nAll of the valleys of northwestern Serbia were swamped by constant rainfall. The mountains had been covered in snow since early October. Acknowledging the opportunity that such conditions presented, Putnik told his closest advisors: \"All my strategy consists in placing the 'Serbian national mud' between the enemy's fighting line and his supplies.\" On 31 October, von Frank's 5th Army pushed down into the region between the Sava and Drina rivers while Potiorek's 6th Army drove west across the Drina and into the Jagodnja plateau. Austria-Hungary's third invasion of Serbia commenced on 6 November 1914, with intense artillery fire strafing a series of Serbian border towns. On 7 November, the Austro-Hungarian 5th and 6th armies attacked across the Drina. Outnumbered and in desperate need of ammunition, the Serbian Army offered fierce resistance but was forced to retreat. The 3rd Army fell back against a road by the Jadar River in an effort to block the Austro-Hungarian advance towards Valjevo, while the 1st Army retreated southward into the Serbian interior and the U\u017eice Army managed to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from crossing the Drina.\n\nOn 8 November, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 2nd Army near Cer Mountain and came within of the Serbian frontline, entrenching themselves at the foot of the mountain. The 2nd Army was given orders to hold the Austro-Hungarians down for as long as possible and, if its position became untenable, retreat towards the right bank of the Dobrava River and position itself so as to block the approach to Valjevo. Elsewhere, the Austro-Hungarians drove a wedge between the 1st and 3rd Army and forced another Serbian retreat. Later that day, the Serbian Government held a joint session with the Serbian Supreme Command with regard to Serbia's worsening military position. Putnik stressed that it was critical for Serbia to hold the Kolubara and the towns within its vicinity and suggested that the Serbs make a separate peace with Austria-Hungary if this proved impossible. This notion was rejected by the Prime Minister of Serbia, Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, who urged further resistance to the Austro-Hungarians and threatened the resignation of his government if peace discussions began. The session ended with the Serbian Government and Supreme Command agreeing to fight on.\n\nPutnik reasoned that Austro-Hungarian supply lines would become overstretched as their forces pressed deeper into Serbia while the Serbs would continue to hold the railheads in the Serbian interior. On 10 November, he ordered a general retreat from the Jadar and withdrew the Serbian 2nd Army to Ub and positioned the 1st and 3rd armies north and west of Valjevo. Meanwhile, the U\u017eice Army took up positions to defend the town from which it took its name. The Austro-Hungarians pressed after the Serbs, hoping to capture the Obrenovac\u2013Valjevo railroad. Clashes ensued and the Serbian Army managed to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from taking the railroad for a time. It quickly became clear to Putnik that he had underestimated the Austro-Hungarians, who managed to bring their heavy artillery through the muddy Serbian country roads. They established firing positions on the Serbian side of the Drina and began targeting the Serbian Army, which suffered heavy casualties. Morale plummeted amongst the Serbs, who were already significantly demoralized due a lack of cold-weather clothing and ammunition and exhausted by the long retreat towards the Serbian interior. Putnik realized that his forces would need to regroup if they were to provide effective resistance. He ordered that Valjevo be abandoned and had the Serbian Army take up positions on the Kolubara. The retreat towards the river was long and excruciating, with the Serbs being forced to destroy all bridges and telephone lines so that they would not fall into Austro-Hungarian hands. The Serbian Army also abandoned most of its heavy equipment to speed up the withdrawal. Seeing that the situation was critical and that Serbian forces were lacking artillery, ammunition and supplies, Pa\u0161i\u0107 sought the help of the Triple Entente. He sent a telegram to his envoys abroad, which read: \"Urgent help is required. Beg and plead.\" France provided the Serbs with munitions and supplies. Representatives of Russia and the United Kingdom \"expressed understanding\", but those countries failed to deliver weapons and munitions.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarians entered Valjevo on 15 November, prompting wild public celebrations in Vienna. Franz Joseph praised Potiorek for seizing the town; cities across the empire made Potiorek an honorary citizen and Sarajevo even named a street after him. Valjevo's capture led the Austro-Hungarians to believe that they were on the verge of defeating Serbia and that the Serbian Army was no longer a coherent fighting force, but the scorched earth tactics employed by the Serbs during their withdrawal complicated the Austro-Hungarian advance. Although the Austro-Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted, its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance. Putnik's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro-Hungarians. Moreover, the geography of northwestern Serbia favoured defensive operations since the approaches to the Kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from the direction of Austria-Hungary and the river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain. In October, the Serbs had fortified the Jeljak and Maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an Austro-Hungarian attack. This gave them an advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to Kragujevac. The Serbs also established a series of field fortifications blocking the approach to Ni\u0161. The extensive series of fortifications and the difficulty of the terrain which they faced left the Austro-Hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in the gruelling Serbian countryside with almost no lines of communication.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarians reached the Kolubara on 16 November and launched an assault against Serbian defensive positions there the following day. The Serbs managed to force the Austro-Hungarians back and over the course of the next five days, the two armies fought a series of battles under heavy rain and snowfall. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with a large number of soldiers succumbing to frostbite and hypothermia.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian assault began at Lazarevac, a strategically located town just south of Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line and the ability to outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and U\u017eice armies, they might have been able to split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel.\n\nDuring the night of 18 November, the Austro-Hungarians moved into position to carry out a further assault, which began the following morning. The Austro-Hungarians' main goal was to break through the defenses of the Serbian 2nd Army, concentrated primarily around Lazarevac, and to drive the Serbian 1st Army back towards the town of Gornji Milanovac while simultaneously assaulting Serbian positions around the villages of \u010covka and Vra\u010de Brdo which threatened the Austro-Hungarian flank. The Austro-Hungarians gained a foothold at Vra\u010de Brdo by the evening of 19 November, and seized higher ground from the Serbs further to the south. The Serbian 1st Army was forced to retreat the following day, giving the Austro-Hungarians the ability to advance down the main routes leading to Kragujevac. Potiorek believed it was possible that Putnik was trying to lure the Austro-Hungarians deeper into Serbia for the purpose of encircling them and then attacking their flanks, but correctly assessed that the Serbian Army was in no position to carry out such an attack.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarians made a renewed attack against the 1st Army on 21 November, forcing the Serbs back after a series of brutal engagements. The Austro-Hungarians then advanced towards Mount Maljen, aiming to drive the 1st Serbian Army from its positions there. The Serbs withdrew from the mountain after three days of heavy fighting; Potiorek decided not to pursue, allowing them to make an orderly withdrawal. The Austro-Hungarians had suffered heavy casualties and the intensity of the fighting caused them to lose cohesion. As they advanced deeper into Serbia, the terrain became increasingly difficult and exhausted the already tired Austro-Hungarian soldiers. While the Serbian 1st Army withdrew, the 2nd and 3rd armies fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian advance. This led Potiorek to reinforce his positions around Lazarevac, which he aimed to capture and use as a pivot from which to attack Kragujevac while his right flank pushed down the West Morava valley. Austro-Hungarian advances convinced Potiorek that his army had the upper hand. He envisaged that his forces would pursue the surviving soldiers from the Serbian 2nd and 3rd Armies and predicted that the Serbian 1st and U\u017eice armies would be forced to manoeuvre towards Belgrade and Lazarevac, where they would be encircled and destroyed. Combat on the outskirts of Lazarevac intensified once again as a result, and the Serbian Army managed to repulse every Austro-Hungarian assault despite a lack of ammunition. The Serbs began to run out of shells and Stepanovi\u0107 asked the Serbian Supreme Command that the artillery of the 2nd Army be redirected to its rear, as he felt that its failure to contribute to the defense of Lazarevac frustrated his troops and was bad for morale. Putnik instructed Stepanovi\u0107 to keep the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front and told him that the Russians had sent artillery shells for its guns. Stepanovi\u0107 was skeptical, but kept the artillery on the front line as instructed.\n\nBy 24 November, Potiorek was predicting that Serbia would be defeated within a matter of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkoti\u0107 to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from \u010covka and Vra\u010de Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked \u010covka and Vra\u010de Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.\n\nAlthough the Serbian Army had put up fierce resistance and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade would have to be evacuated. On the night of 26\u201327 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior.\n\nDefending along an over-extended front, the Serbian Supreme Command decided to abandon Belgrade. The city was evacuated on 29/30 November. The Austro-Hungarians entered the city on 1 December, prompting yet more celebrations in Vienna. The Serbian people withdrew alongside their army and many retreated to Ni\u0161, where news of Belgrade's fall was greeted \"impassively\", as it had been \"expected since the beginning of the war\". Albin Kutschbach, a German agent in Ni\u0161, reported: \"More refugees are arriving by the day, and despite many people being sent on south, there are certainly still 60,000 people here.\" Germany responded to the capture of Belgrade with delight and sent a congratulatory telegram to the Austro-Hungarian leadership. The Austro-Hungarians ascertained that their war with Serbia would soon be over and began preparing for the country's occupation. On 2 December, the anniversary of Franz Joseph's 66th year on the throne, Potiorek wrote that he was \"laying town and fortress Belgrade at His Majesty's feet\".\n\nIt became increasingly clear to both Potiorek and Putnik that Austro-Hungarian supply lines were over-extended and so, on 1 December, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army to stop and wait for the 5th Army to secure its supply lines east of the Valjevo railway, resulting in a short pause to all Austro-Hungarian military operations. Mi\u0161i\u0107 exploited this brief respite by withdrawing the Serbian 1st Army a full from the front line and ensured that his soldiers had an opportunity to rest. The Serbian Army then converged around Mount Rudnik, where it received long-promised supplies from its allies via the Ni\u0161\u2013Salonika railroad. Putnik's confidence in the ability of his army to launch a counterattack was restored.\n\nOn 2 December, he ordered his forces to attack the Austro-Hungarians all along the front and informed his officers that the offensive was to have the specific purpose of improving Serbian morale. Determined to play his part, the aging Serbian king, Peter I, took a rifle and accompanied his troops to the front. The Serbian offensive caught the Austro-Hungarians by surprise, and at the time that the attack was launched they were holding a large military parade through the streets of Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarians now found themselves defending along an over-extended front as Potiorek had just begun strengthening his left flank, leaving the front line very lightly held. Potiorek knew that he could avoid a serious reversal on the battlefield by preventing the Serbian 1st Army from reaching the watershed of the Kolubara and Morava rivers, but the Serbs were confident. They discovered that the Austro-Hungarians had failed to adequately prepare for a Serbian counterattack, as their artillery was positioned well behind the front line. This meant that the Austro-Hungarian defenders would be unable to use their heavy guns to break up any Serbian advance. Rested and resupplied, the Serbs pushed forward towards Belgrade. By the night of 2 December, the Serbian 1st Army pushed several kilometres past Austro-Hungarian lines, taking a large number of prisoners and inflicting heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians. The 2nd and 3rd armies captured a number of important positions on high ground, while the U\u017eice Army met fierce resistance but was ultimately able to push the Austro-Hungarians back.\n\nThe offensive's initial success served to greatly enhance the morale of Serbian troops, just as Putnik had wanted. Significantly weakened, the Austro-Hungarians did not have time to recover before the offensive resumed the following morning and they were forced into retreat by the end of the day. On 6 December, the British ambassador to Serbia informed the British Government that the Serb offensive was \"progressing brilliantly\". That day, the Serbian Army had broken the Austro-Hungarians at their centre and on their right flank. Outmanoeuvred, the Austro-Hungarians were forced into a full retreat, abandoning their weapons and equipment as they went. Meanwhile, the Austro-Hungarians attempted to consolidate control around Belgrade. On 7 December, they attacked the right flank of the Serbian Army in the city's outskirts.\n\nOn 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians fell back against U\u017eice and Valjevo. The Serbs anticipated that their opponents would entrench themselves and attempt to block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were in no position to block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Ni\u0161, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: \"The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning.\" He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and \"huge quantities of war mat\u00e9riel\". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: \"We could not have imagined that the Serbs were on our heels, after all we had recently been victorious.\" On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river. They did not stop until they had crossed the Sava and the Danube and entered the Banat. Very few Austro-Hungarian soldiers made it back into Bosnia.\n\nOn 13 December, von Frank informed Potiorek that he considered it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces in the city to withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city by the end of the following day.\n\nThe battle ended in a decisive Serbian victory. A directive issued by the Serbian Supreme Command on 16 December reported: \"The recapture of Belgrade marks the successful end of a great and magnificent period in our operations. The enemy is beaten, dispersed, defeated and expelled from our territory once and for all.\" Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, the Austro-Hungarian Chief of the General Staff, attributed the defeat to a Serbian \"thunder bolt from the south\". The battle did not achieve any of Austria-Hungary's objectives: it failed to knock Serbia out of the war, it failed to induce Bulgaria to join the Central Powers and it failed to convince Romania to stay neutral. Austro-Hungarian historians concluded after the battle that defeat by Serbia constituted \"a serious diminution in the Dual Monarchy's prestige and self-confidence\". The battle, like the Battle of Cer before it, drew considerable attention to Serbia and many foreigners came to the country in late 1914 to offer political and humanitarian aid or to fight alongside the Serbian Army. German publicist Maximilian Harden wrote: \"Serbia has risen from its grave on the field of Kosovo. From the source of the Kolubara River it will draw courage for the greatest battles of the whole century.\"\n\nThe Austro-Hungarians suffered about 225,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed, 173,000 wounded and 70,000 taken prisoner. They reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner during the battle and more than 130 cannon, 70 heavy machine-guns and a large quantity of mat\u00e9riel were captured. The Serbs also suffered heavy casualties, with 22,000 killed, 91,000 wounded and 19,000 missing or captured. The Western press was appalled with the scale of atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian troops against Serbian civilians, including women and children. William Shepard, of the United Press, confirmed as an eyewitness that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned, and the whole of northwestern Serbia was nearly depopulated.\n\nMi\u0161i\u0107 was promoted to the rank of \"vojvoda\" for his command during the battle. Potiorek, on the other hand, was relieved of command on 22 December for \"this most ignominious, rankling and derisory defeat\". The decision reportedly made him suicidal. He was replaced by Archduke Eugen of Austria, who the Austro-Hungarians hoped would \"restore Habsburg forces to the glory days of Prince Eugene\". Von Frank was dismissed as commander of the 5th Army and replaced by Karl Terszty\u00e1nszky von N\u00e1das, who had commanded the 4th Corps at the Battle of Cer. The 5th and 6th armies were then merged into a single 5th Army consisting of 95,000 men.\n\nDobrica \u0106osi\u0107's novel \"A Time of Death\" revolves around the battle. It was adapted into a stage play in 1983, titled \"The Battle of Kolubara\".\n\n"}, {"id": "2167299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167299", "title": "No. 100 Squadron RAF", "text": "Number 100 Squadron of the Royal Air Force is based at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, UK, and operates the British Aerospace Hawk T.1 providing 'aggressor' aircraft for air combat training.\n\nNo. 100 was established on 23 February 1917 at Hingham in Norfolk as the Royal Flying Corps' first squadron formed specifically as a night bombing unit and comprised elements of the Home Defence Wing. The unit was mobilised and crossed from Portsmouth on 21 March 1917 to France and was first based at St Andre-aux-Bois, where it received twelve Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2Bs aircraft on complement. These aircraft had been withdrawn from other units where they had operated in daylight, so modifications were required to adapt them for 100 Squadron's operational role.\nOn 1 April 1917, the unit moved to Izel-le-Hameau and took a further four aircraft on complement, in the form of BE2es. The squadron began operations on the night of 5/6 April 1917, when eleven FE2b aircraft attacked La Brayelle Airfield, Douai, where Manfred von Richthofen's 'Flying Circus' was based; Richthofen referred to this raid in his book, 'Der Rote Kampfflieger'. One hundred and twenty-eight 20\u00a0lb (9\u00a0kg) and four 40\u00a0lb (18\u00a0kg) bombs were dropped; four aircraft hangars were reported as having been set on fire and one of the attacking aircraft was lost. On 17 November 1918, 100 Squadron moved to RAF Saint Inglevert.\nOn 4 March 1918, the squadron was sent to Ochey, near Nancy, to form the nucleus of the Independent Air Force under Major General Hugh Trenchard. In August of that year, the unit converted to Handley Page 0/400 heavy bombers and therefore longer range sorties over industrial sites in Germany became possible. The squadron conducted these raids throughout the rest of the war; an aircraft from the unit was the last in war-time to return to base (on the night before the Armistice) from a raid.\n\nAfter the end of the war, the squadron remained on the continent until September 1919 as a cadre before transferring to RAF Baldonnel, near Dublin and re-forming to full strength, re-equipping with Bristol F.2 Fighters for army co-operation. Close air support operations were flown during the Irish War of Independence. Following the end of hostilities the squadron was moved to Spitalgate, Lincs. in February 1922 and converted to bombing, this time with Vickers Vimys and DH9As.\n\nIn May 1924, the unit was re-equipped with the Fairey Fawn. With these aircraft, the squadron performed air-mail carrying services breaking the General Strike of 1926. In September of that year, the squadron took Hawker Horsley aircraft on complement and in November 1930 moved to Donibristle, Fife, converting to torpedo-bombing. Its revised official designation as 'No. 100 (Torpedo-Bomber) Squadron' came later, in 1933.\n\nA further re-equipment came in November 1932, when the Vickers Vildebeest came on complement and with this aircraft the squadron was deployed as part of the operation to defend Singapore, arriving at Seletar in January 1934.\n\nThe squadron was put at readiness shortly after war was declared but, for the period to December 1941, there was little involvement operationally whilst still based at Seletar. In November and December 1941 detachments were sent to Fisherman's Bend, in Victoria, Australia. Intended replacement aircraft (Bristol Beauforts) for the remaining squadron were not forthcoming and, as part of operations against advancing Japanese forces, the unit's obsolete Vildebeest aircraft were used in strikes against enemy shipping. Because of this, during January 1942, the squadron lost most of its aircraft in engagements with Japanese fighters. Despite several attempts to remain operational as a combined unit along with No. 36 Squadron RAF, as Japan made advances in the Far East theatre, most personnel eventually became prisoners of war.\n\nOn 15 December 1942, No. 100 Squadron RAF proper was re-formed in the UK, at RAF Grimsby, near Waltham, as a night-time heavy bomber squadron and was part of No. 1 Group RAF, RAF Bomber Command. In January 1943, the squadron received the first of its new complement of Avro Lancasters; the first operation of the squadron was on 4 March 1943 against a U-boat base at St Nazaire. A few days later the squadron was involved in a raid against Nuremberg in Germany and from then on, as part of Bomber Command's strategic role against Germany, took part in every major raid.\n\nAt the end of 1943, the squadron had completed the second largest number of successful operations of units within No. 1 Group Bomber Command and had the lowest 'loss' rate. On the night of 16/17 December 1943, the squadron received orders to attack Berlin. The raid became known as 'Black Thursday' as Bomber Command lost 25 aircraft on the raid and 28 in crashes at fog-shrouded airfields. That night, 100 Squadron lost their commanding officer, David Holford, who crashed landed approaching RAF Grimsby. On the night of 5 June 1944, the squadron bombed heavy gun batteries in support of the D-Day invasion.\n\nFor the last month of the war, the squadron moved to Elsham Wolds in Lincolnshire. In the latter stages of the war and post-war, the squadron was involved in the humanitarian Operations Manna and Exodus. At the end of December 1945 the squadron moved to RAF Scampton, being the last squadron on that station to operate the Avro Lancaster The squadron then departed for RAF Lindholme in May, 1946.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1950 the squadron was based at RAF Hemswell operating Avro Lancasters and later Avro Lincolns. The squadron left Hemswell in 1950, relocating to Malaysia where it was involved with Operations Firedog and Musgrave. In January 1954, the unit deployed to Eastleigh in Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising. Returning two months later, the squadron was re-equipped with English Electric Canberras, moving to Wittering in Cambridgeshire. It was disbanded on 1 September 1959 but re-formed at Wittering on 1 May 1962, equipped with Handley Page Victor B.2s, which, from early 1964, carried the Blue Steel missile nuclear weapon.\n\nDisbanded again on 30 September 1968, the squadron was re-formed as a target facilities unit in 1972, utilising Canberra aircraft at RAF West Raynham, in Norfolk. 100 Sqn combined with 85 and 98 Squadrons and operated 26 Canberra aircraft from RAF Marham before moving in 1982 to RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire. In 1991, the squadron converted to the Hawker Siddeley Hawk T1, which are now used for training and front-line support roles. On 31 August 1994, the squadron moved to RAF Finningley in South Yorkshire. After the news that RAF Finningley would be shut, 100 Squadron moved without its ground crew to RAF Leeming.\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that, as No. 100 Squadron has a degree of spare capacity in terms of its operations, it would take on an additional role of fast jet flying training. This was undertaken owing to limited capacity in the RAF's existing operation using the Hawk T.2 aircraft, and came three years after fast jet training using the Hawk T.1 was officially ended with the disbanding of 208 Squadron in 2016. The squadron is expected to retire its Hawk T1 aircraft in 2027. The aircraft's role was to be replaced by the Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) programme, which was intended to provide aggressor training to all three British armed services. However, in March 2019, the ASDOT programme was cancelled.\n\n\nThe squadron flag which depicts a skull and crossbones was apparently stolen from a French brothel in 1918. It was later embellished with the squadron name and the motto \"Blood and Bones\". The original flag disintegrated while being looked after by a Flight Lieutenant Trillwood during his time as a Japanese prisoner of war. The flag was originally dark maroon in colour but was replaced by a black flag after the war. Following the 90th anniversary of the squadron, a replica of the original flag was presented to the squadron by Arthur White, a navigator with the squadron during the Second World War, in 2008.\n\nAircraft operated included:\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167302", "title": "Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)", "text": "Admiral Sir Edward Hughes RN (c. 17201794) was a Royal Navy officer who commanded the East Indies Station.\n\nHughes joined the Royal Navy in 1735, and four years later, was present at the capture of Portobelo, Panama. In 1740, he was promoted to lieutenant and served in the Cartagena expedition of 1741, and at the indecisive Battle of Toulon in 1744. In HMS \"Warwick\", he participated in the action against the \"Glorioso\", but without proper support from the \"Lark\" (which was sailing with the \"Warwick\"), the enemy escaped. The commander of the \"Lark\" was subsequently tried and condemned for his conduct, and Hughes received the vacated command. Captain Hughes was with Edward Boscawen at Louisburg and with Charles Saunders at Quebec.\nHe was in continual employment during the peace, and as commodore, commanded the East Indies Station from 1773 to 1777.\nBefore long, he returned to the East Indies Station as a rear-admiral, with an overwhelming naval force. On his outward voyage, he took Gor\u00e9e from the French, and he was called upon to conduct only minor operations for the next two years, as the enemy could not muster any force fit to meet the powerful squadron Hughes had brought from the Channel.\n\nWith Spain and Great Britain at war, Spanish authorities in Chile received a warning that Hughes was heading to Chilean coasts for an imminent attack.\nIn 1782, at the reopening of hostilities in the East Indies, he stormed Trincomalee a few days before the squadron of Suffren arrived in the neighbourhood. For the next year, these Indian waters were the scene of one of the most famous of naval campaigns. Suffren was perhaps the ablest naval commander that France ever produced, but his subordinates were factious and unskilful; Hughes on the other hand, whose ability was that born of long experience rather than genius, was well supported. No fewer than five fiercely contested general actions were fought by the two fleets, neither of them gaining a decisive advantage. In the end, Hughes held his ground.\n\nAfter the peace, he returned to England, and, though further promotions came to him, he never again hoisted his flag. He had accumulated considerable wealth during his Indian service, which for the most part he spent in unostentatious charity. He died at his seat of Luxborough in Essex in 1794.\n\nHis second wife Ruth died in 1800. Hughes' fortune went to Edward Hughes Ball Hughes (c. 1798 \u2013 1863), her grandson by a previous marriage, who became the dandy and wastrel known as \"The Golden Ball\".\n\nThe British East India Company ship the \"Sir Edward Hughes\" launched in 1784, was named after him.\n"}, {"id": "2167305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167305", "title": "Pareiasaur", "text": "Pareiasaurs (meaning \"cheek lizards\") were a clade of parareptiles comprising the family Pareiasauridae. They were large herbivores that flourished during the Permian period. Parareptiles form a sister clade to reptiles and birds.\n\nPareiasaurs ranged in size from long, and may have weighed up to . They were stocky, with short tails, small heads, robust limbs, and broad feet. The cow-sized species \"Bunostegos\", which lived 260 million years ago, is the earliest known example of a tetrapod with a fully erect posture as its legs were positioned directly under its body. Pareiasaurs were protected by bony scutes called osteoderms that were set into the skin. Their heavy skulls were ornamented with multiple knobs and ridges. The leaf-shaped multi-cusped teeth resemble those of iguanas, caseids, and other reptilian herbivores. This dentition, together with the deep body, which may have housed an extensive digestive tract, are evidence of a herbivorous diet. Most authors have assumed a terrestrial lifestyle for pareiasaurs, but bone microanatomy suggests a more aquatic, plausibly amphibious lifestyle.\n\nPareiasaurs appear very suddenly in the fossil record. It is clear that these animals are parareptiles. As such, they are closely related to Nycteroleterids. Like Rhipaeosaurs, they may have filled the large herbivore niche (or guild) that had been occupied early in the Permian period by the Caseid pelycosaurs and, before them, the Diadectid amphibians and Edaphosaur reptiles. They are much larger than the diadectids, more similar to the giant caseid pelycosaur Cotylorhynchus. Although the last Pareiasaurs were no larger than the first types (indeed, many of the last ones became smaller), there was a definite tendency towards increased armour as the group developed.\n\nSome paleontologists considered that pareiasaurs were direct ancestors of modern turtles. Pareiasaur skulls have several turtle-like features, and in some species the scutes have developed into bony plates, possibly the precursors of a turtle shell. Jalil and Janvier, in a large analysis of pareiasaur relationships, also found turtles to be close relatives of the \"dwarf\" pareiasaurs, such as \"Pumiliopareia\". However, the discovery of \"Pappochelys\" argues against a potential pareisaurian relationship to turtles.\n\nHallucicrania (Lee 1995): This clade was coined by MSY Lee for Lanthanosuchidae + (Pareiasauridae + Testudines). Lee's pareiasaur hypothesis has become untenable due to the diapsid features of the stem turtle \"Pappochelys\" and the potential testudinatan nature of \"Eunotosaurus\". Recent cladistic analyses reveal that lanthanosuchids have a much more basal position in the Procolophonomorpha, and that the nearest sister taxon to the pareiasaurs are the rather unexceptional and conventional looking nycteroleterids (M\u00fcller & Tsuji 2007, Lyson et al. 2010) the two being united in the clade Pareiasauromorpha (Tsuji et al. 2012).\n\nPareiasauroidea (Nopcsa, 1928): This clade (as opposed to the superfamily or suborder Pareiasauroidea) was used by Lee (1995) for Pareiasauridae + \"Sclerosaurus\". More recent cladistic studies place \"Sclerosaurus\" in the procolophonid subfamily Leptopleuroninae (Cisneros 2006, Sues & Reisz 2008), which means the similarities with pareiasaurs are the result of convergences.\n\nPareiasauria (Seeley, 1988): If neither Lanthanosuchids or Testudines are included in the clade, the Pareiasauria only contains the monophyletic family Pareiasauridae. It's a traditional linnaean term.\n\nBelow is a cladogram from Tsuji \"et al.\" (2013):\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167307", "title": "Lechon", "text": "Lech\u00f3n (; from \"leche\" \u201cmilk\u201d + -\u00f3n) is a pork dish in several regions of the world, most specifically in Spain and former Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world. \"Lech\u00f3n\" is a Spanish word referring to a roasted baby piglet which was still fed by suckling its mother\u2019s milk (a suckling pig). Lech\u00f3n is a popular food in Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America. The dish features a whole roasted suckling pig cooked over charcoal. It has been described as a national dish of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Spain.\n\nAdditionally, it is popular in the Philippines and other Austronesian regions, whose pig-roasting traditions have native pre-colonial origins. Although it acquired the Spanish name as a general term for \u201croasted pig\u201c, in these regions it more often refers to adult roasted pigs, not lechones (milk suckling pigs). It is also sometimes considered as one of the unofficial national dishes of the Philippines, with Cebu being asserted by American chef Anthony Bourdain as having the best pigs.\n\nIn most regions of the Philippines, lech\u00f3n (also spelled \"litson\" or \"lichon\") is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, festivals, and the holidays. Although it acquired the Spanish name, Philippine lech\u00f3n has pre-Hispanic origins as pigs are one of the native domesticated animals of all Austronesian cultures and were carried throughout the Austronesian Expansion all the way to Polynesia. It is a national dish of the Philippines. There are two major types of preparing lechon the Philippines, the \"Manila lechon\" (or \"Luzon lechon\"), and the \"Cebu lechon\" (or \"Visayas lechon\"). \n\nAs the usage of the Spanish loanword evolved over the years in the languages of the Philippines, \"lech\u00f3n\" has come to refer to roasted pig in general (including suckling pigs). Roasted suckling pigs are now referred to in the Philippines as \u201clech\u00f3n de leche\u201d (which in Spanish would be a linguistic redundancy, though corresponding to the term cochinillo in Spain).\nVisayan lechon is prepared stuffed with herbs which usually include scallions, bay leaves, black peppercorn, garlic, salt, and distinctively \"tanglad\" (lemongrass) and/or leaves from native \"Citrus\" trees or tamarind trees, among other spices. A variant among Hiligaynon people also stuffs the pig with the sour fruits of \"batuan\" or \"binukaw\" (\"Garcinia binucao\"). It is usually cooked over charcoal made from coconut husks. Since it is already flavored with spices, it is served with minimal dipping sauces, like salt and vinegar or silimansi (soy sauce, calamansi, and labuyo chili).\n\nLuzon lechon on the other hand, is typically not stuffed with herbs. When it is, it is usually just salt and pepper. Instead, the distinctiveness of Manila lechon comes from the liver-based sauce, known as the \"lechon sauce\". Lechon sauce is made from vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, mashed liver (or liver spread), breadcrumbs, garlic and onion. Manila lechon is also typically cooked over woodfire.\n\nMost lechon can either be cooked based on the two main versions, or mix techniques from both. Both variants also rub salt or spices unto the skin to make it crispier, as well as continually baste the lechon as it cooks. Sometimes carbonated drinks may also be used. They are cooked on a bamboo spit over charcoal for a few hours with constant (traditionally manual) turning. The pig is roasted on all sides for several hours until done. The process of cooking and basting usually results in making the pork skin crisp and is a distinctive feature of the dish.\n\nLeftover parts from the lechon, such as the head and feet, are usually cooked into another popular dish, \"lechon paksiw\". Like lechon itself, \"lechon paksiw\" also differs based on whether it is prepared Luzon-style or Visayas-style, with the former using liver sauce as an essential ingredient, while the latter does not. In some cases, these parts or stale lechon can be repurposed into another dish, such as Sisig.\n\nThe dish has been described as a national dish of Puerto Rico. The name of the dish in Puerto Rico is \"lechon asado\". It is a traditional dish served at festivals and holidays.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167312", "title": "Deltora Quest 3", "text": "Deltora Quest 3 (also known as Dragons of Deltora) is a series of children's fantasy books, written by Australian author Emily Rodda. It follows the adventures of three companions, Lief, Barda, and Jasmine, as they journey across the magical land of Deltora to awaken the last seven dragons and destroy the Four Sisters (creations of the evil Shadow Lord, which have been poisoning Deltora's crops causing the people and creatures of the land to starve). It comprises four books which were first published in Australia in 2004 and 2005 in the United States by Scholastic. The \"Dragons of Deltora\" series is preceded by two other series that take place in the same fictional world and feature the same characters and continues the story. These series are \"Deltora Quest\" and \"Deltora Quest 2\" (also known as \"Deltora Shadowlands\"). Collectively, these three series are known as the \"Deltora Quest\" series or the \"Deltora\" series.\n\nThe novels in this series are \"Dragon's Nest\", \"Shadowgate\", \"Isle of the Dead\", and \"The Sister of the South\".\n\nJust as the gems of Deltora had guardians in \"Deltora Quest,\" the Four Sisters each had a guardian to defend them. These guardians included:\n\nA Capricon and servant of the Shadow Lord, Rolf is the Guardian of the East who is first encountered in the Os-Mine Hills. In series three, he is captured by Granous and saved by Lief and his companions. Proclaiming that he is a prince, he is taken into Lief's party out of pity and later on believed to have been killed by a ruby dragon, though this is false. He is the one that takes the form of a ruby dragon and destroys the companions' escort. He tries to destroy the companions when they reach Dragon's Nest, but is defeated by the true Ruby Dragon and Lief.\"Lief-hero of Deltora. Also adins true heir.\"\n\nA woman that Lief, Barda, and Jasmine discover in a castle in the mountains. She was Mariette's sister and Bede's girlfriend until Bede chose Mariette over her. This made Kirsten bitter with resentment and so she allied herself with the Shadow Lord for vengeance. The Shadow Lord gave Kirsten magical powers and thus she became the Masked One, now a sorceress with the appearance of a black-cloaked figure with a green mask and pale hands that could kill others just by touching them. She used her power to enslave Bede and imprison Mariette in her locket. She also had the power to conjure phantoms of herself in Deltora, a technique she used to try to kill her enemies. In return she was given the task of guarding the Sister of the North. When Lief, Barda and Jasmine went to her castle, they at first thought that she is under Bede's power, however Bede was able to clue them in with his song. Kirsten almost killed Barda and Jasmine when she caused the walls of her castle to swallow them. However, as Lief jumped into the snake pit that the Sister of the North was contained within. The snakes in the pit latched onto Kirsten and bit her, killing her with their venom very slowly because Kirsten was protected by an enchanted spell.\n\nAlso known as \"\"Dragonfriend\"\" by the dragons, Doran is Deltora's greatest explorer and was a kind and noble man. He developed everlasting friendships with Deltora's dragons and even explored Deltora's underworld and befriended the Pirran people that had sheltered themselves there. When the Ak-Baba killed nearly all of the dragons of Deltora, Doran went to each of the remaining dragons and had them go into a deep hibernation until they were woken by Adin's heir wearing the Belt. Doran then found out too late that the Dragons were an obstacle to the Shadow Lord's plan to plant the Four Sisters throughout Deltora and by having the dragons go into hibernation, Doran had removed this obstacle once and for all. Doran then drew a map to where the Four Sisters were located and asked the map to be delivered to the King, but the people of Deltora thought he was mad. His map was found by the Shadow Lord and torn into four pieces. Doran then went into the wilderness to find another way to get rid of the Sisters and was never seen again. Later it was revealed that the Shadow Lord had captured Doran and as punishment for resisting him, Doran was forced to become the immortal vessel of the Sister of the West (having the Sister contained inside his own body) and thus he was unwillingly forced to become the Guardian of the Sister of the West. He became situated in the Kobb's lair on the Isle of the Dead. Lief and his group managed to finally meet him and Doran was saddened to discover that the diamond dragon was dead, but was overcome with joy when he found out her daughter still lived. Veritas, the amethyst dragon, was forced to destroy Doran by stealing his breath in order to destroy the Sister of the West that he guarded, but knowing that the diamond dragon species still lived and that there was still hope for Deltora, Doran died a peaceful death as he disintegrated into dust.\n\nWhen Ranesh left to Tora, this young girl took his place as assistant librarian to Josef, but it is revealed she is a servant of The Shadow Lord and guardian of The Sister of the South. She was made such in the Shadowlands, while her dark Master concocted his plan. As one of the cruelest guardians, she pumped Josef for information, and, when she had no further use for him, poisoned him. Far from punishing her, Doom and Lief pity her as she dies. Paff had gone willingly, it seems, to the Shadow Lord, partly because she hated everybody who did not appear to love her.\n\nThere are many riddles, poems and codes throughout the books. These are a few of them:\n\nThe four map pieces (East, North, West, and South) that were made by Doran the Dragonlover and helped Lief find the four sisters each had a fourth of a poem.\n\n\"Sisters four with poisoned breath/ Bring to the land a long slow death.\"<br>\"But death comes swiftly if you dare/ To find each sisters hidden lair.\"<br>\"Their songs like secret rivers flow/ To hold the peril deep below.\"<br>\"And if at last their voices cease/ The land will find a final peace.\"\n\nThe companions thought that meant after they defeated all four Sisters the Shadow Lord might give up on trying to rule all of Deltora.\n\nAt the entrance to each Sister's lair there is an inscribed stone with a poem warning travelers away.\n\nAt the entrance to Dragon's Nest the stone inscription said:\n\n\"Travellers do not pass this way, all are doomed who disobey.\"<br>\"Turn your faces to the west, death awaits in Dragon's Nest.\"\n\nAt the entrance to Kirsten's castle the poem was:\n\n\"Do not enter this domain, flee this realm of fear and pain.\"<br>\"Death and terror both await, those who enter Shadowgate.\"\n\nAt the foot of the rock bridge on the Isle of the Dead the inscription said:\n\n\"If you pass your fate is sealed, ahead pure evil lies concealed.\"<br>\"Turn while you have life and breath, flee this realm of living death.\"\n\nUnder the chapel altar in the palace the carved stone was different than the other three. Instead of a warning to travelers and passerby, it was a taunt to Lief himself. It read:\n\n\"Lose and win? Or win and lose? Royal coward, you must choose.\"<br>\"Bow your head and creep away, or you and yours will curse this day.\"\n\nThe first code was from Fa-Glin. The code was just two paragraphs separated into groups of four letters. The code's translation said: \"I grieve to tell you that the new crop we pinned our hopes has been disappointing. The vines were sickly from the first, and only six baskets of small, sour fruit resulted from all our care. the yam harvest was also very bad, many of the yams having rotted in the ground. Hunting is poor. There are few fish in the stream. If only we could eat the fruit like our neighbours the Kin! The boolong trees thrive like the weeds they are, but all parts of them disagree with us. It will be another hard winter on Dread Mountain, I fear.\"\n\n"}, {"id": "2167315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167315", "title": "Eric Johnston", "text": "Eric Allen Johnston (December 21, 1896 \u2013 August 22, 1963) was a business owner, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, a Republican Party activist, president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and a U.S. government special projects administrator and envoy for both Democratic and Republican administrations. As president of the MPAA, he abbreviated the organization's name, convened the closed-door meeting of motion picture company executives at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that led to Waldorf Statement in 1947 and the Hollywood blacklist (including firing of the Hollywood Ten), and discreetly liberalized the production code. He served as president of the MPAA until his death in 1963.\n\nAn Episcopalian, Johnston was born \"Eric Johnson\" in Washington, D.C. His father, a pharmacist, moved the family to Marysville, Montana, when Johnston was a year old. In 1905, the family moved to Spokane, Washington. The Johnsons divorced in 1911, and Eric's mother, Ida, changed her and her son's last name to \"Johnston.\"\n\nHe attended the University of Washington, where he joined the Theta Delta Chi fraternity and graduated in 1917. During this time, he worked as a stevedore, newspaper sports columnist, library clerk, and shoe salesman.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I, Johnston enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was commissioned a second lieutenant, and became a Reserve Officers' Training Corps commander at the University of Washington in 1918. He was promoted to captain, fought with the American Expeditionary Force Siberia in the Russian Revolution, and was named military attach\u00e9 in Peking. Johnston acquired some Mandarin, traveled widely in Asia, and successfully speculated in Chinese currency.\n\nWhile in Beijing, Johnston was assaulted by an unknown person. His skull was fractured, which led to sinus infections and lung ailments and his discharge from the Corps in 1922 for medical reasons. Johnston returned to Spokane for its dry climate, where he married his long-time girlfriend, Ina Hughes. He became a vacuum-cleaner salesman, and bought the Power Brown Co., the Pacific Northwest's largest independent appliance distribution business. In 1924, the newly renamed Brown-Johnston Company purchased the Doerr-Mitchell Electric Co., a manufacturer of electrical appliances, ironwork and glassware.\n\nJohnston was elected president of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce in 1931. He became managing trustee of the bankrupt Washington Brick and Lime Co., led it out of bankruptcy, and became its chairman. Johnston also became president of the Wayne-Burnaby Company, a regional electrical contractor.\n\nAs a rising regional businessman, Johnston became active in the national Chamber of Commerce. He was appointed to its tax committee in 1933, elected a director in 1934, and elected vice president in 1941. Johnston became head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce after a revolt by younger, moderate business executives pushed several older, conservative candidates aside. He refused to antagonize the American Federation of Labor or the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and advocated labor-management cooperation. Johnston persuaded the labor federations to make a no-strike pledge during World War II.\n\nIn 1940, Johnston ran in the Republican primary for Senator from Washington state, but placed a distant second place with only 18 percent of the vote.\n\nJohnston served on several wartime commissions for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, including the Committee for Economic Development, the War Manpower Commission, and the War Mobilization and Reconversion Committee. In 1943, President Roosevelt named him chairman of the United States Commission on InterAmerican Development. He traveled widely in Latin America, reassuring heads of state that the United States intended to protect them in the event of war.\n\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin invited Johnston to tour Russia in 1944. Johnston agreed, and Roosevelt appointed Johnston an emissary of the United States. Johnston spent nearly a month in the Soviet Union, and was the first American diplomat to tour the Central Asian Republics of the Soviet Union. He met with Stalin for three hours at a time when Ambassador W. Averell Harriman had yet to present his credentials to the premier.\n\nJohnston retired as Chamber of Commerce president in 1945. He was awarded the Presidential Medal for Merit in 1947.\n\nJohnston was named president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDAA), the predecessor of the MPAA, in 1946. He immediately changed the name of the organization to its current title, the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nIn September 1947, the motion picture industry came under sharp criticism by the House Un-American Activities Committee for allegedly permitting known communist sympathizers to include pro-communist messages in motion pictures. Spurred by Red-baiting members of the MPAA as well as a fear of government censorship, Johnston agreed to institute a blacklist.\n\nOn November 25, 1947, Johnston was part of a closed-door meeting with 47 motion picture company executives at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that resulted in the \"Waldorf Statement\". Johnston issued a two-page press release that marked the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist.\n\nDuring his tenure at the MPAA, Johnston quietly liberalized the production code. He also engaged in major initiatives to secure a significant American share of the overseas motion picture market, and to reduce restrictions on the screening of American films in foreign markets.\n\nIn January 1951, Johnston was appointed administrator of the Economic Stabilization Agency by President Harry S. Truman, replacing Alan Valentine. He lasted only a few months in the job.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Johnston a \"Special Representative of the President of the United States\" to deal with the water conflict between Israel, Jordan, and Syria in 1953. He worked to solve the Middle East's water problems by negotiating the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan.\n\nJohnston traveled to the Soviet Union and met Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1958. The following year, he hosted Khrushchev in both Washington, D.C., and California during Khrushchev's 18-day visit to the United States.\n\nIn 1963, while still MPAA president, Johnston suffered a stroke in Washington, D.C., on June 17. He was hospitalized at George Washington University Hospital, where he suffered a second stroke on July 4. He entered a coma on August 5 and died on August 22, 1963. He was succeeded at the MPAA by Jack Valenti in 1966 after a three-year search.\n\nJohnston appears a key character in the play \"The Waldorf Conference\", written by Nat Segaloff, Daniel M. Kimmel, and Arnie Reisman. The play presents a fictionalized account of the Waldorf Conference of 1947 and the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167323", "title": "William Dameshek", "text": "William Dameshek (1900, Voronezh \u2013 1969) was an American hematologist.

She set a women's record for the 12-hour time-trial which exceeded the men's record for two years.\n\nBurton was born Beryl Charnock in the Halton area of Leeds, West Yorkshire and lived in the nearby Morley area throughout her life, racing mainly for Morley Cycling Club and later Knaresborough CC. In childhood, she suffered chronic health problems which included 15 months in hospital and a convalescent home due to rheumatic fever.\n\nShe was introduced to cycling through her husband, Charlie, whom she married in 1955. Charlie described her development as a cyclist as follows:\n\n\"First of all, she was handy but wasn\u2019t that competent: we used to have to push her round a bit. Slowly she got better. By the second year, she was \u2018one of the lads\u2019 and could ride with us. By the third year, she was going out in front and leading them all. By then it was 1956 and she decided to do a bit of time trialling because I was dabbling at it.\"\n\nIn 1957, she took her first national medal, a silver in the national 100-mile individual time trial championship, and before the decade was out was competing internationally.\n\nDespite receiving offers from sponsors, she remained an amateur throughout her career, working on a rhubarb farm during much of it.\n\nBurton won the women\u2019s world road race championship in 1960 and 1967 and was runner-up in 1961. On the track, she specialised in the individual pursuit, winning world championship medals almost every year across three decades. She was world champion five times (1959, 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1966), silver-medallist three times (1961, 1964 and 1968), and winner of bronze in 1967, 1970, 1971 and 1973.\n\nIn domestic time trial competition, Burton was almost unbeatable. She won the Road Time Trials Council\u2019s British Best All-Rounder Competition for 25 consecutive years from 1959 to 1983. In total, she won 72 national individual time trial titles; she won four at 10 miles (the championship was inaugurated in 1978), 26 at 25 miles, 24 at 50 miles and 18 at 100 miles. Her last national solo time trial titles were achieved in 1986 (at 25 and 50 miles; she was part of the fastest team, Knaresborough CC, in the 50 mile event in 1969).\n\nShe also won a further 24 national titles in road racing and on the track: twelve road race championships, and 12 pursuit titles.\n\nIn 1963, Burton became the first woman to break the hour barrier for the 25-mile time trial, subsequently also going below two hours for the 50-mile TT and four hours for 100 miles against the clock.\n\nIn 1967, she set a new 12-hour time trial record of 277.25 miles\u00a0\u2013 a mark that surpassed the men\u2019s record of the time by 0.73 miles and was not superseded by a man until 1969. While setting the record she caught and passed Mike McNamara who was on his way to setting the men's record at 276.52 miles and winning that year's men's British Best All-Rounder. She is reputed to have given him a liquorice allsort as she passed him.\n\nShe also set about 50 new national records at 10, 15, 25, 30, 50 and 100-mile distances; her final 10, 25 and 50-mile records each lasted 20 years before being broken, her 100-mile record lasted 28 years, and her 12-hour record stood for 50 years until 2017. Her prowess led to the rare distinction, for a woman, of an invitation to compete in the Grand Prix des Nations in 1967.\n\nIn 1982, with her daughter Denise, Burton set a British 10-mile record for women riding a tandem bicycle: 21 minutes, 25 seconds.\n\nRecognition of her sporting achievements came with her appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1964 and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1968. Burton also won UK cycling's top accolade, the Bidlake Memorial Prize, a record three times, in 1959, 1960 and 1967.\n\nHer daughter, Denise, was also a top cyclist, winning a bronze in the 1975 world individual pursuit championship. Mother and daughter were both selected to represent Great Britain in the 1972 world championship. In 1973 Beryl won the national road title ahead of Denise. Three years later their positions were reversed - Beryl refused to shake hands with Denise on the podium afterwards, later explaining the incident in her autobiography \"Personal Best\": \"I thought Denise had not done her whack in keeping the break away and once again I had \u2018made the race'\u2026 It was not a sporting thing to do\u2026 I can only plead I was not myself at the time\".\n\nBurton, who had always had a somewhat odd heart arrhythmia, died of heart failure during a social ride, when she was out delivering birthday invitations for her 59th birthday party. Her daughter also suggested that Burton's competitive spirit and drive eventually just wore her body out.\n\nA memorial garden, Beryl Burton Gardens, was established in her home town of Morley. Morley Cycling Club also donated a trophy (previously won 20 times by Burton) to the RTTC for a Champion of Champions competition for women of all ages: the Beryl Burton trophy.\n\nThe \"Beryl Burton Cycle Way\" allows cyclists to travel the 2.8\u00a0km between Harrogate and Knaresborough without using the A59 road.\n\nIn 2009, she was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. In 2018 she was named as one of the first two inductees into the \"Rouleur\" Hall of Fame, alongside Eddy Merckx.\n\nBurton's career achievements were first celebrated in 1960 when \"Cycling Weekly\" awarded her a page in the Golden Book of Cycling. By 1991 her career had developed so far that she was accorded the unique honour of a second 'Golden Book' page.\n\nOn 27 November 2012 a radio play, \"Beryl: A Love Story On Two Wheels\", about Burton, written by actress Maxine Peake, was broadcast by BBC Radio 4, with Peake playing Burton. It included interview snippets with Charlie Burton, and his and Burton's cycling champion daughter, Denise Burton Cole.\n\nThe radio play was adapted by Peake for the stage to coincide with the start of the Tour de France in Leeds, and shown at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in June and July 2014 titled simply \"Beryl\". The play returned for a second run at the West Yorkshire Playhouse a year later in June and July 2015, followed by an autumn 2015 tour around England. A production of the show is scheduled to take place at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton in September and October of 2019.\n\n"}, {"id": "2167330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167330", "title": "Legends of Skyfall", "text": "The Legends of Skyfall was a series of four adventure gamebooks written by David Tant and published by Armada in 1985.

He was the producer of various Australian game shows such as \"Blankety Blanks\" (based on a Mark Goodson-Bill Todman production, \"Match Game\") and \"Wheel of Fortune\" (based on the US Merv Griffin production of the same name), before later diversifying into soap operas and serials including \"Prisoner\", \"The Young Doctors\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Neighbours\", which was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nReginald Roy Grundy was born on 4 August 1923 in Sydney, New South Wales, to Roy Grundy and Lillian Lees. Grundy served in the Australian Army during World War II as a Sergeant stationed in Sydney in the 1 Motor Division Signals. He enlisted in December 1941 and was discharged in August 1946.\n\nGrundy started his media career as a boxing and general sports commentator for the Sydney radio station 2SM in 1947. While he was working at 2CH Sydney in 1957, Grundy conceived and hosted the \"Wheel of Fortune\" game show on radio, which moved to Channel Nine two years later. He founded his own production company Reg Grundy Enterprises in 1960, and began producing game shows for the Australian and overseas market, before eventually branching out into drama in 1973. In 1977, he co-produced \"\".\n\nThe company produced several successful television soap operas and drama series including \"Class of '74\", \"The Restless Years\", \"The Young Doctors\", \"Prisoner\", \"Glenview High\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Neighbours\". Grundy was the first person to sell an Australian drama to America (\"Prisoner\") and the first to sell an Australian quiz show to the UK (\"Going for Gold\"). He subsequently started the US-based company Reg Grundy Productions, which produced the 1980s NBC daytime game shows \"Sale of the Century\" and \"Scrabble\", as well as \"Time Machine\" for NBC, \"Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak\" for ABC and \"Scattergories\" also for NBC.\n\nThe Grundy Organisation was ultimately owned by Grundy Worldwide Ltd, based in the tax haven of Bermuda. In 1995, he sold the Grundy Organisation to the media and publishing company Pearson PLC, now Fremantle, for $386 million. Grundy owned the private media investment company RG Capital which had shares in several FM radio stations. Grundy also had shares in WAM Capital, Austereo, Argus Solutions and Photon Group.\n\nGrundy had a lifelong passion for wildlife photography. He published a book of photographs in 2005, \"The Wildlife of Reg Grundy\". In June 2009, an exhibition of photographs of Bermuda Longtail birds by Grundy, \"Longtails: The Bermuda Dream\", opened in The Rick Faries Gallery at the Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art.\n\nGrundy married Patricia Lola Powell in 1954 and they had a daughter, Kim. After Grundy and Powell divorced, he married the actress and author Joy Chambers in 1971. The couple met at a television audition in the 1960s. Chambers was 18 and Grundy was in his forties. They renewed their vows several times. Grundy and Chambers moved to Bermuda in 1982.\n\nIn 2015, the \"Australian Financial Review\" listed Grundy as Australia's 59th richest individual, with a wealth of $809 million. Grundy published an eponymous autobiography in 2010. He was the owner of a yacht named Boadicea, which was sold in 2009.\n\nGrundy died on 6 May 2016 at his Bermuda home, with his family by his side. No cause was given. After his death was announced, many tributes were paid to Grundy. Presenter Andrew Denton commented \"I'm sure the record will show that more Australians have watched more hours of Reg Grundy television than that of any other individual.\" While actress Jackie Woodburne, who worked on Grundy productions \"Neighbours\", \"Prisoner\" and \"The Young Doctors\", stated that \"Reg was a true groundbreaker in Australian television in the 70s and 80s, and beyond in light entertainment and drama.\"\n\nTracy Grimshaw, who interviewed Grundy in 2010, said \"RG was a pioneer in game shows, in drama, in soapies. He was a star maker. But he totally rejected the limelight. He only gave one television interview in his life, and I was privileged and fascinated to be the one who spoke with him.\" Grimshaw's interview with Grundy was rebroadcast during the 9 May edition of \"A Current Affair\". Ian Hogg, whose company bought Grundy Organisation, announced that FremantleMedia were thinking of a permanent way to honour Grundy.\n\nGrundy was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the New Years Honours of 1983; and was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 2008. He received the International Emmy Founders Award in 1996 and the AFI Raymond Longford Award in 2010. In July 2004, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy by the University of Queensland.\n\nColloquially, in Australia, \"Reg Grundies\", \"Grundies\" or \"Reggies\", is rhyming slang for \"undies\" (underpants).\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167344", "title": "Chris Adrian", "text": "Chris Adrian (born 1970) is an American author.

Cohen is best known for his pioneering work on computer viruses, the invention of high integrity operating system mechanisms now in widespread use, and automation of protection management functions.\n\nIn 1983, while a student at the University of Southern California's School of Engineering (currently the Viterbi School of Engineering), he wrote a program for a parasitic application that seized control of computer operations, one of the first computer viruses, in Leonard Adleman\u2019s class. He wrote a short program, as an experiment, that could \"infect\" computers, make copies of itself, and spread from one machine to another. It was hidden inside a larger, legitimate program, which was loaded into a computer on a floppy disk.\n\nOne of the few solid theoretical results in the study of computer viruses is Cohen's 1987 demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.\n\nCohen also believed there are \"positive viruses\" and he had created one called the compression virus which spreading would infect all executable files on a computer, not to destroy, but to make them smaller.\n\nDuring the past 10 years of his research work, Fred Cohen wrote over 60 professional publications and 11 books.\nFor the past 35 years, Fred Cohen has been building companies and supporting risk management and strategic decision making for enterprises of all sizes and sorts.

They produce meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye's tear film. Meibum prevents tears spilling onto the cheek, trapping the tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and making the closed lids airtight. There are about 50 glands on the upper eyelid and 25 glands on the lower eyelid.\n\nDysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to blepharitis.\n\nThe glands are named after Heinrich Meibom (1638\u20131700), a German physician, who first described them.\n\nLipids are the major components of meibum (also known as \"meibomian gland secretions\"). The term \"meibum\" was originally introduced by Nicolaides \"et al.\" in 1981.\n\nThe biochemical composition of meibum is extremely complex and very different from that of sebum. Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum. Recently, an update on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids was published.\n\nCurrently, the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of meibum is mass spectrometry either with direct infusion or in combination with liquid chromatography.\n\nIn humans, more than 90 different proteins have been identified in meibomian gland secretions.\n\nDysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to blepharitis. Inflammation of the meibomian glands (also known as \"meibomitis\", \"meibomian gland dysfunction\", or \"posterior blepharitis\") causes the glands to be obstructed by thick waxy secretions. Besides leading to dry eyes, the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial lipases, resulting in the formation of free fatty acids, which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause punctate keratopathy.\n\nMeibomian gland dysfunction is more often seen in women and is regarded as the main cause of dry eye disease. Factors that contribute to meibomian gland dysfunction can include things such as a person's age and/or hormones or severe infestation of Demodex brevis mite. Treatment can include warm compresses or expression of the gland by a professional. Lifitegrast and Restasis are topical medication commonly used to control the inflammation and improve the oil quality. In some cases topical steroids and topical/oral antibiotics are also prescribed reduce inflammation. Intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments have also been shown to reduce inflammation and improve the gland function in patients. Meibomian gland probing is also used on patients which experience deep clogging of the glands.\n\nMeibomian gland dysfunction may be caused by some prescription medications, notably isotretinoin.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2167352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167352", "title": "Ploughshares", "text": "Ploughshares is an American literary journal established in 1971 by DeWitt Henry and Peter O\u2019Malley in The Plough and Stars, an Irish pub in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Upon realizing that they and their supporters would never be able to agree on a specific editorial outlook for the magazine, the co-founders decided that the position of editor would be a rotating one. As a result, a majority of Ploughshares issues have been edited by various members of the community, giving the journal a unique and constantly changing voice.\n\nThe first issue was published in September 1971.\n\nThe magazine soon became recognized as a home for talented new writers. Some of the writers whose first or early works have appeared in Ploughshares are: Russel Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, John Irving, Thomas Lux, Sue Miller, Tim O'Brien, Jayne Anne Phillips, Robert Pinsky, and Mona Simpson.\n\nIn later years it has gone on to publish some of the leading voices in contemporary literature, including\n\nIn 1989, \"Ploughshares\" became affiliated with Emerson College.
